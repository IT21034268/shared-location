4,The main character's surname as book title...again???,"However...an interesting and original idea, written in typical Herbert style. I enjoyed reading it but once I got to a certain point in the book, I sensed deja vu. There was definately a similarity with one of his other books, which I won't name so I don't give away any endings. However still a stimulating read with potential to scare. :)"
4,Wonderful fiction that is still relevant today!,"This is the first of the three James Bond novels that feature the nefarious Ernst Blofield and Spectre as the villains. The plot is ingenious, and still has relevance for today's world, alas. This novel proceeds at a brisk pace throughout, and always succeeds in holding the reader's interest.Author Ian Fleming has a spare, lean style of writing that I find very appealing. Unlike today's often bloated thousand-plus page novels, ""Thunderball,"" in common with all of Fleming's work, manages to tell a fairly complicated and always-interesting story in as few words as possible. This style of writing maintains the mystery of what really makes the enigmatic James Bond tick, and of course, this question is half of the fun of these excellent spy novels.Highly recommended."
5,Very Best of Jackie Martling's Talking Joke Book,Funny as Hell!!! People at work are busting a gut over these jokes and repeating them to friends and family.
3,The Reduced Shakesphere Company The Complete History of America,I am very disappointed in Amazon. I never received my DVD. I was charged on my credit cardand never received my merchandise. I am calling my credit card company and asking for a credit for the purcahse that I never received.It was purchased through Day Trader. I mailed themabout this product and never received an answer.Very bad cuatomer service.
2,"It's not awful, it's just boring","I laughed myself hoarse the *third* time I watched The Complete Works of Shakespeare, but this effort lacked the energy and originality of the first. It reminded me of the revues that the staff put on at a Bible camp I went to, or maybe it's more like what you'd see at an amusement park when the lines get too long for the rides. Anyway, I got as far as World War I and realized it wasn't going to get any better and hit eject."
2,Expecting more,"I couldn't figure out if it just wasn't written well or just not performed well. Since 2 of the 3 did the brilliant Complete Works of Shakespeare, I don't think it was the performers. And actually, the writing, in and of itself, was not bad. So what, then, made it disappointing? I'm not sure. It just seemed so flat. But if you're just trying the troupe out, I heartily recommend the Complete Works of Shakespeare, it's utterly brilliant."
4,Decent,"For the low cost, and small size, it's a cute little toy. The pictures are somewhat decent, but all images are web cam quality.I wouldn't replace my other digital camera with it since the quality isn't that great, and the resolution isn't even 1MP. But to play with and just carry around for random snapshots of junk I see on the street, it's a great little thing to keep in my pocket.As much as I like it, I have to admit that the worst feature is the annoying beep which simply cannot be disabled. What the hell were they thinking when they added this was a ""feature?"""
1,JUNK,"This cammera is so poorly made and so inconvient to use that,after 3 days, I put it in a drawer.It will stay there for about 6 months until I get over feeling silly about buying it. Then I will move it to the garbage can. It's best features are that it was a cheep mistake and it doesn't take up much room in the drawer. I wish I had listened to the reviews I had read on ZDNET and CNET."
4,Particularly enjoyed his account of his formative years,"The recollections of Waugh are particularly funny when he describes his childhood up through his service in the army in Cyprus. After that, you have to be a student the British literary establishment and a confirmed anglophile to follow and tolerate all his comings and goings and shameless name-dropping. The first half of the memoir, though, more than justifies the investment. Waugh is a very funny man. Droll is the best way to describe his humor. Or ""withering."""
3,"Okay, not quite how they look in the picture","The earrings that I have are darker than the ones in the picture though they are still a nice cobalt blue. Too bad they aren't a little bigger, I'd like them a lot more. Still cute though."
5,first years gate extension,this is just what i needed for the extension for the gate. very sturdy. would recomend to any one needing an extension
5,Works great...,"If you already have a first years hands free gate, this extension works great to block off those extra wide doorways. We actually use the gate for our dogs and it works perfectly. We've had the gate for almost two years. We have an extension on both sides (one came with the gate) and we've had no problems."
4,perfect extention,"I love that this product dose not get screwed into the wall, therefor leaving no repairs that have to be done to the walls. It was easy to put together and to put up."
2,"Too much funk, not enough rock !","Jeff Scott Soto is a great rock & roll singer, but on this cd he sings to many songs that sound funky. The songs are weak. When Jeff sings rock,he kicks ass, but in this cd there are no rock songs. If you want a great JSS cd get Lost in Translation."
4,THE guide to Turkey,"This is the only guide to Turkey a backpacker could need. The recommendations - once again - are spot on. Lonely Planet seem to have a better feel for this market than any of the other travel guides, both from the readers' point of view and from the places that they cover. I ran into some complaints from pansiyon owners in Turkey about the tactics used by some of the other guides when reviewing hotels - and some of the ethically questionable practices they took part in to include hotels in their guides. Not so Lonely Planet, apparently. The only real quibble I had with this guide was some of the snide asides - and the frequent references to whether certain places were suitable for women seemed a little excessive. Other than that - high praise, as with all other Lonely Planet guides."
2,missed information,"It is a great book for backpack travellers but not really for those who would like to learn more about deep history on the country and the sites. I have also noticed (In some parts) that it is not reflecting what most of the Turks mentalities are. I don't think it is fair to write something which is not correct for most of the local people for their practise in their real life,I mean there need to be a more observation to write about the locals and their life,work,etc."
1,Braun's losing interest in cats - or is it me?,"If I had bought this book I would have been yowling mad (especially if I paid full price!) But I borrowed it from the library (not being able to afford first editions as Qwill can), and even that was disappointing. There is very little about Koko and Yum Yum - if I hadn't read all the other books in the series I wouldn't appreciate the small tidbits about their personalities here. It was like ""been there, done that."" Qwill is becoming a bore with his only interests being in homespun activities that even people ""400 miles from everywhere"" never would think of doing. The one bright spot in the book was the absence of that sickenly sweet, insipid, bookish, and weak-hearted woman-friend, Polly. I personally wish the heart attack a couple books ago had done her in. Ms. Braun. Please return to your beginning allure, mystery, and documentation of the cats. Otherwise I'm switching to Brown's cats."
1,NOT CD set as listed,"Very disappointed, this is NOT a CD set, it is audio cassettes. I was so excited to finally be getting a new Lilian Jackson Braun book to listen to, and it comes in cassette, not as listed as CD's, not practical in today's world and a huge waste of time and money for me."
3,"Not the best, but...","I'm giving this book three stars as a neutral entry. I certainly didn't enjoy it as much as her previous works, but I didn't hate it either. Okay, so the ending was a bit sketchy, but did all of you wondering what happened to the hiker read the ending? Or did you just give up and leave the last couple of pages unread? My personal opinion is that Ms. Braun is introducing a bit of a different mystery into her mystery. The questions are supposed to be unanswered, because Qwill is beginning to question his own skepticism. Maybe the Sand Giant DID kill the hiker... Okay, I'm a skeptic myself about that stuff, and I must say I'm disappointed, as all of you seem to be, that there was no neat, 'non-occultish' explanation for the hiker's death. But Ms. Braun certainly has literary license to introduce whatever kind of mystery she wants into her mystery books. I'm still looking forward to the next one... (Okay, maybe a bit more on the cats would be nice in the next one!)"
1,Did I miss something?,"This is the first book I have ever read by this author and well ... I am very disappointed. This was supposed to be a mystery novel? What was the mystery? I will read another one of her books just in case this particular one was a fluke. The others can't possibly be worse than this one, can they?"
4,The Cat Who,"Not too long ago, i read another detective book that slightly trashed ""the cat series"". Being a cat-lover, i was somewhat upset because i do believe cats to be prescient. Lilian Jackson Braun never fails with the series. Q is especially divulging with his character, which i enjoyed because he seemed more human in this book. A few loose ends were not tied up, but all in all this was an entertaining read."
2,Just not up to usual standards...,"Disapointing. Where is Koko's solution? Where are the clues that solve the case that we poor blind humans miss? I love the series, but this is the bottom... sure hope the next one is better."
4,A wonderful way to learn new words,"This book taught me many new words that are valuable for everyday conversation. It is divided into different categories such as: number words, medical words, words from other languages, figurative expressions, etc. The authors give a definition and a sentence for each new word. They give exercises to help you master the words. The book also tells the history of some words which is often a good way to remember the word. However, sometimes these can get boring since they are all basically the same. I used this book to study for spelling bees, and I recommend it to students and adults alike. You will learn from this book."
5,Good Quality,Our Frenchie looks like a tough guy with this. The quality is great and the nubs are not too sharp. The leather is nice and thick along with strong metal buckles.
2,j edgar hoover,it wasn't a very good movie.there was nothing to it.not interesting at all.save your hard earned money.not worth the price.
5,They've still got it.,"This is really good. All the material on this CD is comparable in complexity and feel to the more melodic stuff on ""A Happy Pocket"", like ""Unfortunate Age"" and the TCS cover of ""To Sir, With Love""."
2,This book is not impressive at all!,From the other reviews you would think this book was great - but it's not good at all! Maybe they read a different version but I bought this book very recently and found that it didn't have a lot of helpful content. There are other books on the same topic that are much better than this one - buy those before you get this one.
3,Not his best,"I liked only half of the songs on this album. All are superlative musically, but in my opinion, the songs recalling romantic disappointments, not to mention the existentially-tinged ""My Shadow Companion"", have no place on a work of what is presumably CCM. Too bad his earlier albums are no longer available. Over the years, I've heard a number of his (older) songs on Christian radio, and they have been superb, uplifting, and thought-provoking without exception (reminiscent of Fernando Ortega, as another reviewer mentioned). Hopefully Mr. Bennett's next album will be up to his previous level of excellence."
4,Light Introduction to Emerson's Eastern Thought,"The American essayist and poet Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803- 1882) was famous for Transcendentalism in 1836 that found inspiration in Vedic thought, German idealism (Kant) and the mystical thinking of Emmanuel Swedenborg. We know that Emerson read the Bhagavad Gita. The Swami makes the point that it is one thing to read Oriental philosophy and another to assimilate it which Emerson did. Some of Emerson's writings that prove this point are Circles, Immortality, Compensation, Over-Soul and Brahma. This is a light introduction to what other writers would have made a heavy technical discussion. The easy reading with a minimum of detail was typical of Swami Paramananda's books, which in many cases were originally public talks.The book under review is the 2nd edition published by the Vedanta Centre, Boston, Massachusetts copyright in 1918 76 pages."
2,One of the worst things i ever watched,"The first hour was okay, getting the charters together and bringing them to never land, but that where it stops for me. Peter becomes this annoying brat that can't seem to do anything right. Everything!! he touches dies!!. chaos seems to follow him everywhere. Hook can't make up his mind on helping the kids or destroying them. If peter just thought before running into things all gun-ho then maybe so many people wouldn't have died. flying around looks painfully horrible. i would watch the robin william remake a hundred time over before watching this again."
5,Never a dull moment in Neverland!,"I was excited to see the new mini-series, Neverland. It was a wonderful movie and I thought the actors were wonderful!! I agree with one of the posters, that the flying could have been done a bit better, but when you think about it, he was just learning to fly and I believe anyone would be awkward. I cannot wait until it comes out on DVD, so I can own it and watch it again and again!! Well, done!"
5,Great Series,"Great Series, i wish they'd continue it. In my opinion it was the best peter pan story put on video ever. Im fine with it being a mini series, but it should have more than two parts. 20 episodes to start, and see how popular it is. If the other episode are as good as this... I dont see any reason it wouldn't be a hit."
3,"Cute, but not easy to use","These booties are really super cute. However, they are hard to get on my 3 month old's feet. For some reason they are hard to pull onto her feet; I think b/c her feet tend to be sweaty a lot so the fabric does not glide well. They also don't stay on very long even though I secured the velcro tab in the tightest position. They get flung right off a minute later b/c there is so much space. I am hoping it will be better once she is older. But so far she hasn't really even noticed the booties except when I hold them up and show them to her (not when they are on her feet)."
5,Stunning drama of Anglo-Irish and gender politics ;,"This is a story about two women ; a mother now dead and her surviving daughter now grown up and at a crossroads in her life. It is also a story about a key time in Irish history ; late 19th century Nothern Ireland. This is a beautifully written book. The book resembles strongly that part of Northern Ireland, it is set in. Beautiful, stark and forbidding. Beth is the daughter of a local wealthy Protestant, whose wife, a Catholic, is dead. Beth will face choices between her life with her father and a life with the man she loves. There are twists and turns handled superbly against the backdrop of the hauntingly beautiful Fermanagh countryside. This book is worthy of a single sitting read."
5,Great set,"Bought this blue ray set for $18. Revenge, one man defeating armies, machine guns, big knives, things blowing up. All in high def picture and sound. What's not to love."
4,"""NOTHING IS OVER ...NOTHING!!""","By me purchasing this box set, I have completed the Rambo series in Blu Ray. So with that being said, I've always loved the Rambo flicks (as unrealistic as they may be). Art doesn't always have to imitate life and, never has it been truer than with this series. It looks and sounds great, at least better than it ever did. One, however, must ask...Did Lionsgate really pull out everything in the arsenal to clear these flicks up ? Probably not, but it still looks the best it ever has. Not a bad deal at less than $25 for the box set. I think I spent more than that on Rambo IV alone."
4,Great blu box set but pain in the ass to open each box,"I don't know how much security tape I had to go threw in order to get a blu-ray out of the box. But for that amount of disc within the box, it is quite a bit of work...."
2,Space - The Final Frontier?????,"One word to describe this novel - BLAND. The subject matter is about two rival gangs of the 60's, the Mods and Rockers, taken to `the future' by an alien race where they wage a war on each other that keeps going on and on and on. The `future' environment they are in consists of buildings and robots and weapons you would expect to find in a 60's comic magazine. I'm thinking that the tone and subject matter of this novel would have fit better with a 2nd Doctor adventure rather than an 8th Doctor one. The characterisation of the Doctor and Fitz are great though and Compassion is hardly even in the book. But of all the other characters - they are just really annoying and frustrating. The book is still worth a read - but don't expect much from it."
4,Introduction of Chess Strategy,"Regardless some minor evaluation errors, this book is a good introduction for chess strategy main concepts: outposts, open files, weak pawns and squares, and space advantage. The examples are great but easy going, showing mainly the games of positional masters (Botvinnik, Petrosian, Fischer), featuring clearly every topic. It's title defines the treatment very well.I think it could be a good introduction to other more comprehensive books like My System or the Middlegames books by Euwe. I would recommend this book to beginners and amateurs who want an introduction to positional theory."
5,exelent book on positional play,"this is a thin book of about 120 pages written in old descriptive notation . it is not for beginners but for players rated at least 1100 or above .it is concerned about positional play and chess strategy .its chapters are outposts ,weak pawns ,open files,half open files(minority attack ),black squares and white squares and space .it is very clearly written and to the point.i own more than 100 chess books and i rate it in top 15 in what i have read .there is more clearly written chess wisdom in it than some books of double its size.sadly ,it is perhaps out of print now so try to find it in used book stores ."
4,My 21 month old daughter loves this seat!,Our daughter was throwing the occasional fit when she couldn't sit at the table like a big person. We bought it based on all of the terrific reviews and we weren't disappointed. Highly recommend it to other parents!
5,Booster Seat,"Of all booster seats I have seen or used, this is the handiest and most effective. It holds the child in place, allows the child to sit close to the table, and is easily cleaned."
5,Very small and wonderfully portable,We bought this chair to travel to visit family in Alaska. We love it because of how small it is. We can easily throw this into the car anytime we travel to friends for dinner. Easy to clean as well.
2,Unsafe product,"Looked like a great idea for travel purposes. very compact and easy to put in suitcase; however, was unsafe to use with my 16 months old; he almost fell out of it on several occasions; straps are too low, and did not support his weight; maybe it will be OK for 6 months old, but not for a bigger kids. I will not recommend this product."
4,Worked out nicely for our vacation,Bought this for our vacation and it worked out nicely at restaurants and outside on the patio for my 8 month old. Only caution - do not sit baby too close to table where they can pull things down or lean forward and bang their head. Worth the money spent.
1,first years on the go,The booster is very small than actually picture and it does not stay straight on a chair.it bend towards over
2,"Okay, but not great","It was okay, but not the absolute best. There are better ones out there. I wasn't impressed with the plot or the characters, all of them were annoying and immature. Couldn't stand the main girl with her wanting impossible-cow-jumping-over-the-moon love with a guy who is not too good at showing any of his feelings for her. And I was annoyed with her not wanting what she wanted when the main guy started to show his feelings for her too. The plot was below average and the drama was a little difficult for me to keep watching it to the very end. Could hardly wait for it to be over and done with."
1,I usually like Denise but....,I've been a Denise Austin fan for almost ten years now. I used her videos in my 20's to loose some extra weight and I'm using them again now in my 30's after having a baby. There is no doubt her videos get results and I'm sure this one would too. However I HATED this video! The pace is so fast when she transitions from one move to another that by the time you get it she's onto the next one. She's also never been really great about giving ques when the move is going to change but this workout is the wort I've ever come across. If you are new to Denise Austin please don't get this video. It's horrible and you'd never want to try any of her other workouts. I also didn't find anything about this that was specific to weight loss after a baby. I had a c-section and found some of the moves uncomfortable to my stomach even after waiting six weeks to work out. Any of her other videos would be great to use for weight loss.
3,When the Party's Over,"I bought this movie because of Sandra Bullock. She did justice to her character, but overall the movie was not the best. I have most of her movies, but if she was not in it I would not have watched it and definitely would not have bought it."
3,It's OK- if you just take it in good fun,"At a school dance was the first time I ever heard it, and I was singing along with it after about a minute. It's a stupid song, but the tune is catchy,and so are the lyrics. My friend and I were saying how stupid it was, but we were both singing it. All in all, it's a song for girls, but it's pretty funny.A good party song! =)"
1,The Very Worst Movie Ever!,"I must absolutely agree with the one other reviewer here, so far, who also gave this one star.....this ""movie"" WAS a TV production, and even in that genre, one of the worst examples I have ever seen. What was evident from the outset was the combination of terribly orchestrated histrionics from the lead ""star"", Bergen, the nevertheless largely wooden presentation, and the unbelieveably predictable, telegraphed plot line, and presentation. My wife and I turned it off after 10 minutes. Cannot believe Amazon charged $4.32 for this, when Amazon otherwise so often presents real bargins on this site, including the free passes for those of us on Prime."
2,Disappointment,"The never-can-tell Pigface stretches about 45 minutes of good work into over two hours on this long-winded ode to self-indulgence. The ""new high"" is you know, you know, you know and high, high, high. The ""low"" is the entire second disk, 73 interminable minutes with only three (actually two) different ideas."
1,Way to have the DVD just end in the middle of a scene,"As other readers have pointed out, the dimwits at Triad Productions allowed their DVD to simply end in the middle of a scene, a full 15 minutes before the film has reached completion. Genius. Absolute genius."
4,Crystal Lewis is great,"After hearing this album I understand why she is the best female singer among christians. She really rocks. And her messages reaches me! I've never heard Crystal Lewis before, but I gave her a chance and she took it"
3,Gorgeous artwork,"This book includes a wonderful collection of dragon related artwork, including pictures of paintings, engravings, and figurines dating through the ages. This is a great overview of the scope of mankind's imagination about dragons.Unfortunately, the text was a little disappointing. I was hoping for a bit more detail about the history of dragonlore and how it has evolved through the ages. Instead, this is largely a collection of disparate dragon legends and myths. Its not bad for what it is, but isn't what I was expecting."
5,my new skin,i love my macbook but i don't like that it's white. i was always paranoid that my husband was gonna get it dirty.. i got the white skin and it looks great i feel so much better with this on my mac. and it feels great. if you have a mac you need this skin. my sister got a mac and she's getting one..
3,we need it in spanish!,Muy práctico y necesario para proteger el teclado pero no se ajusta a mi teclado en español. Sería maravilloso que lo fabricaran en español
3,"Great for keeping debri out, but........","I bought this skin due to the fact that this was to be my work computer on the road. My work did not lend itself to clean environments, so I purchased this product. It worked and fit as advertized, but did not match perfectly the updated keyboard of the newish MacBook. Also, the skin left marks on the screen, which I have still not gotten completely off. The idea was great, but the execution was short, due to side effects and not a perfect match on markings."
1,Translating the message from above,"He says that ""this cd is no good ...this person does not know how to sing. Don't buy this cd if you think it's Minerva the Latin Pop Dance Diva. Cause it's NOT!! This CD is depressing.C'YA"
2,Cute but won't stay on very well,I have trouble with these staying on her feet and she pulls them off almost instantly.
1,Out of date and Incorrect title,"The book is a failed attempt at preparing you for the exam. In fact, the title even incorrect. The term ""Border Patrol Inspector"" has not been used in decades. The correct job title is U.S. Border Patrol Agent."
1,No reason to exist,Other than being a spoof of James Bond there is no reason for this movie. It's too boring to be even considered bad.
4,Odd take on Casino Royale,"This was a great movie. It seems as if every time it can't get any crazier, some new unbelievable thing happens that escalates until that very strange fight at the end. While this definitely isn't the best take on the book Casino Royale, it sure is fun to watch. It seems like the kind of thing where whenever the directors had some strange idea, they said ""What the heck!"" and threw it into the movie. This is definitely a great movie to watch. Just be prepared for anything."
1,Where's George Lazenby When You Need Him?,"This alleged spoof of Bond films is outright stuporous. Absolutely nothing works here. I found my attention waning while watching this film and having to pinch myself to stay awake. I think I drew blood. There are wall-to-wall ""gags"" here and none of them are funny. It took five count 'em five directors and three screenwriters to concoct this abomination and it shows. There is no fluency in the direction and the story is downright incoherent. The film's few saving graces is that David Niven and Peter Sellers escape with their reputations intact. There's a pretty good Bacharach-David score here but too bad it's not in the service of a better picture. Ian Fleming must be rolling in his grave."
2,Silly movie,"I'm amazed that so many reviewers think this film is great. I didn't even make it half-way through the film before I lost interest and turned it off. This is the type of film one watches when one has nothing better to do. When I am able, I will try to watch the entire film and try to give it a higher rating."
2,Very weak Bond parody...,"""Casino Royale"" is the most confused Bond film ever created. It is a comedy based on the first Bond book with a stellar cast, but an awful script and an excruciating runtime. It's hard for me to watch this film without falling asleep. So much of it fails to generate anything that could possibly be entertaining. There are occasional funny parts and a couple of entertaining moments, but the movie feels like an over-budgeted flop. David Niven makes a lousy 007 who is mostly bumbling and completely unbelievable. Ian Fleming is turning in his grave... but he does flips with ""A View to a Kill,"" which is worse than this one."
4,Required viewing for all 007 fans,"Even though this is a spoof of the ever popular and everlasting James Bond film dynasty, it is the first full length film version of the Ian Fleming novel. It is not the first time though that 007 made the American screen if you count the TV version of Casino Royale with Barry Nelson as 007. With three different James Bonds (David Niven, Woody Allen, Peter Sellers), in one film and some great Bond Girls, it add an award nominated Burt Bacharach music score (The look of love). Many of the film's actors/actresses were in previous or subsequent 007 films and one went on to play the most galactic villain of all time: Darth Vader.This film was indeed entertaining especially to see all the well-known actors/actresses all together in one film. None of the iconic James Bond film gimmicks or puns might disappoint the dedicated Bond fans; so I rated it a 4 instead of 5. but it has so much other credits to compensate for that. Read all those details here: [...]."
3,"Only for hardcore 007, Sellers, or Niven fans","The movie is hit-and-miss (probably more ""miss"" than ""hit"") but it does entertain through most of its considerable length. The extra features are good, specifically, a 20 minute interview by one of the directors, Val Guest. It does include the '54 TV broacast as well, but BEWARE: the version on this DVD is missing the final few minutes of the original broadcast. If you're interested, I highly recommend the Collector's Edition VHS which includes the full-length TV show plus a highly informative intro by Lee Pfeiffer, as well as a collection of trailers for the movie not included on the DVD. No true Bond fan should be without either version."
3,The First Bond,I bought it to see what the first Bond movie was like. It was mildly entertaining but not as good as I expected.
5,Find your own opinion!,"If you are a serious Bond-fan,you are supposed to hate this film,as you are supposed to love Goldfinger.Well,I am definitley a serious Bond-fan,and I love this film.Enjoy!"
2,Thoughts on The Mastermind of Mars,The Mastermind of Mars introduces a new character and yet it is exactly the same story again. Needs more John Carter :-)
5,Fantestical!,"Got hooked from the CKY VIds.. ordered this album, and it hasn't come out of all of my CD playersin 3 week solid my friends are forced to listen to it cause I can't take it out .. it's FANtestical as are the vids!!!"
5,"IF YOU HATE AWESOME MUSIC, DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!!!","This is definatly one of th----, no, THE best Cd I have ever blessed upon my ears, the different styles combined with the talent of this band, you can't expect less. If your tired of the ordinary stuff, and want to try something new and exciting and just all around chaotic, BUY THIS ALBUM RIGHT NOW!! There's not much more I can say except congrats to Deron, Jess, Vern, and of course, Chad, great job, can't wait to see you on tour. xPHYLLISx"
5,Best Rock cd of 2002,"When i first heard cky, i thought they were very good. Then i started to watch the movies, and then listened to volume 2 then this one. THis is another great cd from cky. Whether it's ""Plastic plan"" or ""Close yet far"", rock music can't get better than this. With ""flesh into gear"" (played during the credits of JACKASS: The movie) and ""Escape from Hellview"", these songs just are the best you could ever find. A must-buy for any rock lover."
1,For the tin ear crowd,"Well, what can one say when a band is this BAD!? Thank god I didn't buy their crap, just unfortunately heard it somewhere. Please, save your money for REAL music!"
5,A heart-warming movie that shows the true meaning of love for a pet.,"I remember seeing this movie as a kid and being quite upset when Thomasina got hurt. Now many years later, as an adult with my own children, it still brings a tear to my eye. The love and devotion this little girl had for her kitty should be shared with anyone who has an animal companion!"
1,Don't waste you're money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I read the reviews and thought I'd give it a chance. Don't bother it stinks, does nothing to help my laptop. In fact my laptop keeps shutting down from the heat. 2 Trivets under it work better. What a waste of $[...] bucks--guess I should have kept the box. Don't buy this ,you'll regret it."
1,Didn't work for me,I downloaded a core temperature module for the PC to evaluate the claim of this product. Several days of testing indicated that this product made no difference when used or not used.
5,Incredible album by an under-rated guitarist,"Slaughter on Tenth Avenue and this are Mick Ronson's best solo efforts. His guitar playing and producing have never been ignored by any musicians familiar with Ronson's work. However many don't realize what a fine singer and songwriter he was also. His version of the Empty Bed and his song Billy Porter alone make this album worth owning for any music fan let alone Ronson fans.I am so glad both albums were remastered and that Amazon sells them. Ronson is one of those musical icons many are not familiar with but should be.He was much more than just the great guitarist that played and engineered those early Bowie spiders from mars masterpieces, he was a great talent in his own right. This album displays some of that talent. An enjoyable album to boot."
2,Not your usual combat medic,"I was expecting a more in-depth analysis into the combat and mental condition of a medic, but what I got was a long drawn out story of himself. There was no connection w/ his fellow men and if there was, it was just a misconception. Basically, he just want to forget about the war, the horror, and the cruelty behind it. If that is the case, then why write the book."
3,Litwak's Memories of Love and War,"This book was recommended to me by my father, also a WWII medic. In fact, my father remembers being in combat medical training in South Carolina at the same time as Mr. Litwak. I have been told many stories by my father about the life of a medic as well as his capture during the Battle of the Bulge. Mr. Litwak's book left me somewhat empty as I was hoping for more insight into the life of these very special men, combat medics. I found his pursuit of a young French woman to be the romantic memories of a young man in a terrible situation. This is an enjoyable quick ""read"" but if you're hoping to learn more of the medic's life, I suggest you look elsewhere. A big ""Thank You"" to Mr. Litwak and WWII vets everywhere for their remarkable sacrifice."
1,Was this book necessary?,"What a boring waste of 400 pages. The main character is a guy I could not care less about, the secondary characters are 2...nay, 1 dimensional, and the plot twists seem to be more the result of an author being late on his deadlines, than something born of inspiration and literary sweat. There is an interesting premise, but it goes nowhere...or at least nowhere interesting. Save your money, save your time...buy a collection of Peanuts cartoons..there is much more wisdom and enjoyment there."
5,Wow!,"Memorable songs, good crunchy guitars, and that voice! ooooh! It is a shame that people will pick up this album and assume that it is rap or hip-hop. It has a lot more to do with Band of Gypsies (Jimi Hendrix, you youngsters), or Mother's Finest, etc.A great, original sound... stands above most of the slick junk I hear on the radio.Come play in Texas. This stuff would be devastating live!"
1,wrong c/d in the case! very disappointed...never got what i ordered!,was so excited to get this c/d and when i opened the case...the wrong c/d was in it! i was so very disappointed!never got my c/d...but i paid for a c/d i didnt order
2,A bit Disappointed....,"Okay, I liked the book at first and thought it had promise but somewhere it lost me. I just felt that 3 love interests in a romance novel didn't fit. I was hoping that she would fall in love with cole and then the point would be for her to go back to future and try to save him and then stay with him, or save him and find his direct decendant in the future...someone that may have looked like him, acted like him, etc....this I would believe. She kept saying that Cole was underneath Tarik but that didn't seem the case since they seperated the two characters. The whole thing with Tarik was disappointing after I already got to know Cole. And I agree with previous posts...what was the point of Leonie and Wendall....the fact that he slept with Wendall was a little creepy to me. The ending was just really a disappointment since I loved A Knight in Shining Armor. Oh well, better luck next time I hope."
2,"An ok read, but lacking when compared to a Knight/Armor","I started Ledgend fully expecting it to be a no put downer like the previous Knight/Armor. I was sadly disapointed. The book was not only confusing, but it seemed to jump from one story line to another and dragged in a lot of places. I definitly think that Jude Deveraux can do a lot better. All in all it wasn't a bad book, just not my first choice of an exciting time travel."
1,Pathetic,"I read the entire 374 pages of this book and I would not wish this book on anyone. The writing is amateurish and the story is ludicrous. Jude Deveraux wrote a wonderful book when she wrote ""A Knight in Shining Armor"". I like some time travel books but this book is not one of them. I could not wait to get to the end of the book but I read to the end to see how this silly story would end. Jude Deveraux needs to return to higher standards as she did when she wrote ""A Knight in Shining Armor""."
3,Better the second time around,"This is better the second time around. The first time I got too attached to Cole. Knowing everything before hand is much better. I'm not going to give away to much because some people may still want some surprises. Cole has a big secret, which Kady finds out about from somebody.I won't say how she meets the other guy, but on second read he is more likeable (you may want to wait a few weeks at least to reread the book to get how great Cole was out of your mind)Too much time was spent on Kady's relationship with Cole, and not enough on the one with the other guy. An extra chapter or two at the end would have been nice.The best part of the book, surprisingly, was actually near the end. I won't give away what happened.Cole does get his own story in an anthology. However, he's quite different then he is in this book."
2,Interesting at the beginning... but then it all falls apart.,"I really like Jude Deveraux's books, and when I first started reading LEGEND, I thought I would enjoy this one too. I was wrong. It started out pretty well with an occasional bump or two, but as I read to page 190-something, that whole business with the grandma totally threw me off. I had to read that section over and over again, but still didn't understand the whole thing. If Mrs. Deveraux had kept this book at a simpler level, it would have turned out much better."
3,Good book,"I really loved this book as I have read it a few times in the past. However, after reading it this time the main character Kady really irritated me to no end. Her constantly talking about the veiled man and how she felt she knew him all her life and how he was there for her through everything got on my nerves. And when she finally met the man she knew nothing about him yet still she kept telling herself she knew him so well.I absolutely loved Cole. He was such a joy to read and it really sadden me when Kady went back and found out that Cole was just a 9 year boy and not the 30 something man she thought of him. He was the whole joy of this book for me this time around, and well I loved him all the other times I read it. If it weren't for his character, I would have probably passed on this story. But he makes it worth the read and the buy."
4,I loved the book...it took me away from my cares for awhile.,"This one a great book. Not only did it take me away to another time...but it made me want to become a chef! The characters were clear and enjoyable. The story was easy to follow and had a few surprises to offer. Going back through time to right a wrong is one of the things everyone would love to be able to do. The only thing is I wish the ending was alittle more clear. If you change history, you dramatically change the future. All in all, I love time travel books and rate this one of the good ones"
5,Kent Firefly LED Lighted Gel Bicycle Seat,the Kent Firefly LED Lighted Gel Bicycle Seat works very well and is very visible to motorists when riding ay night
4,Ok,"Este libro es igual al ""Essential Grammar in Use"" by Raymond Murphy. La unica diferencia entre los dos libros es el CD."
3,Not my favorite,Silent Storm is a fairly good game but as others have said there's quite a few bugs. I put up with the bugs in Sacred because I loved the game but this Encore game is not my favorite.
1,Worse piece of crap ever,The booked sucked. It was written bad and has absolutley no soul. I bought it for my nephew to give as a gift but now I am not sure if thats such a good idea. Also the seller charged my $1 more dollar then the book is actually priced. Do not waste your time with this book or seller.
4,Good short overview of Greek myth figures,"Short little informational stories of all the major players in the Greek Myths, not too in depth, but fine for a overview. A good companion to the Percy Jackson stories."
3,"Functional product, But We Preferred Another Product","We wanted a moderately priced laptop stand to raise up the screens for all the laptops used in our office and tried out a few different products. This product was OK, but our ""testers"" universally preferred the Kensington Easy Riser Cooling Notebook Stand. We have standardized on that model, coupled with a Logitech keyboard (Deluxe 250 Vista Qualified USB Keyboard - Black). So the entire solution set came in @ about $40/person."
3,"Bulky, but good.","I didn't really use this because it didn't fit my desk very well. It's kind of bulky, but I also have a really dumb-shaped desk that doesn't really allow for these types of things.All in all, this probably would have done what I wanted, but like I said, it's a bit bulky. It also seems a little flimsy when you are trying to adjust the height, the pieces are hard to get off and I was afraid of breaking the unit trying to resize it."
5,Great for Work!,"This riser is perfect for the office. I can view my laptop at a higher level than before, with the separate keyboard and wireless mouse at desk height. There is room underneath the laptop, which is perfect if you want to hide some unsightly things, like extra wires, scratch paper, or your cellphone. Be sure to use this just for your laptop, though--one person in our office broke his by using it as a flat-screen monitor riser."
5,Awesome griddle over the fire!,"Used it for the first time this weekend. Started off with a couple of frozen burgers for dinner. The ribbed side wasn't good for them since they were frozen and really thin, but flipping it over and using it like a flat top griddle worked great! Very slight sticking, but used it right out of the box, so that was to be expected.Second meal was breakfast this morning: hash browns, bacon and eggs! Nothin' like fried eggs in bacon grease! A paper towel to wipe it down when done and little oil to protect it and viola, done!Will definitely be using this to cook many camping meals on for years to come!"
5,Great Inspiration,I really loved this book. It has really helped me to see the areas of my life that I need to work on.
1,WARNING! This book is dangerous!,"My mother in law gave me this book because she thought the title looked nice! I was in shock once I started paging throught it. I am a Christian woman in my 30's, raised in Christian home and I couldn't believe that this book was written in my lifetime. I found it downright disturbing. It is this type of legalistic thinking that drives women insane (quite literally sometimes!) To be so controlled by even a loving husband is unthinkable to me, but what if your husband is a BAD guy! God loves us and wants us to abide by HIS will. Want to know what to do? Get down on your knees and pray, open the bible and search, and yes, discuss things with your husband, trusted friends and family members."
1,lawn leaf pick up,The product was broke when I opened the box..adjustment handle was broke off.wasted my moneythis lawn leaf pick up is a bad product
1,blah!,"what a dissappointment! not anything like i expected. i thought it might be at least somewhat funny. . . but i was wrong. alot of people are comparing this to scary movie. my opinion on that. . . i thought scary movie was ok. i`d give it 3 stars. but compared to this movie, it gets 5! i`d wait and rent it on video. haha, no, i just wouldn`t bother with it at all. unless your young and want to see alot of topless scenes, go ahead!"
5,The funniest movie!!!,"This movie is so funny! I love it because it's so cliche to all the teen movies of the past. Every character you can think of from any teen movie is featured in this movie. I swear, I can start watching this movie an hour into it and it still makes me laugh! It's probably the stupidist movie I have ever seen but it's too amusing not to love!"
2,Of course it stunk,"...but come on, what could you really expect? As a stand-alone comedy, this movie is useless. No surprise there. Were it not for the poor execution and lousy casting, this movie could have been so much more than it is.However, for those of us who were raised on ""teen movies"" (from Sixteen Candles through the latest glut of knock-offs), it's like a low-brow game of trivial pursuit. It's fun just to sit back and try to catch all the references, as well as try to peg the oh-so-familiar songs. I wouldn't spend money on it (I watched it on HBO), but I can think of worse ways to spend an hour or so. (If only to hear the last line from Molly Ringwald's cameo - absolutely priceless. :P)"
2,It's harmless,"Centered around the plot of ""SHE'S ALL THAT"", this movie is entertaining, but just a little bit. It has a good promise of wrecking havoc upon the brainless teen movies, but, in the end, it becomes another teen movie."
2,I laughed maybe twice during the entire film...,"I actually thought that this would be a halfway decent spoof. The previews were hilarious, but they also gave away all of the movie's funniest parts. Aside from a few scenes, none of this was even remotley funny. It was mainly very crude and offensive, and I am sorry to say that I wasted my time watching it. The film borrows it's plot from ""She's All That"", in which the popular jock makes a bet to turn the school nerd into the prom queen. From there on, theres nothing but filth. There were two scenes that I laughed at: a spoof of a musical number from ""Grease"", and the spoof of the Ricky Fitts character from ""American Beauty"". I gave this film two stars basically because the spoof of Ricky was just totally hilarious.If you certainly must see this film, I would advise you to skip it for now, and wait until the video/DVD arrives--or then again, don't bother!"
1,A Load of American ...,"This was the worst movie I had ever seen. It demorilises what society is, and just uses the worst form of toilet humor. It is so insulting and just another heap of American ...."
1,SOOO BAD I am surpised it STUCK to FILM!!!,"One of thee most OFFENSIVE movies I have had the displeasure of seeing. This movie if you can even call it a movie is merely a- waste- of- time- snippets of any chance to be as disgusting, crude, offensive and unfunny as possible.I am not taken back easily but was surprised this movie did not earn a NC-17 rating. The scene with the catholic school girl was the icing on the cake of offensivness....some people seriously sold their souls to the devil, or their brains to monkeys..for this to be made."
4,Just a little harmless fun,"this movie is not supposed to be brainfood people, it is just a lil harmless fun."
4,film trauma,"I remember being very excited to see this film since I was a fan of the series. After viewing it, however, I couldn't sleep. It was too disturbing. Watching someone suffer the way L. Palmer did was awful. What I still struggle to understand was whether or not BOB was an invention of the Palmers, a man whose physiognomy represented the sick perverse behavior an American father could not possibly enact, or a real demon. Regardless, there is a sequence in this movie, a sort of emotional climax right after L discovers her father is BOB and walks to school that is one of the most powerful I've seen. Lynch comes closer to rendering human suffering and mental anguish than any other filmmaker."
4,It's very good but ...,It's terrific but is more like Blue Velvet than the Twin Peaks tv series.I give it four rather than five stars because it isn't what a fan of the series really wanted..which was more of the best of the tv series.However it's terrific if you watch it as a David Lynch movie set inTwin Peaks.
2,A WANT MY DELETED SCENES,"I love this movie! I am happy with My Import Disc however I did buy this DVD because I wanted this movie on DVD. If you want to show off a GREAT sound system put on this disc. In the first scene an axe goes through a TV and makes an ear shattering noise! NOW everyone the DVD PICTURE AND SOUND IS GREAT HOWEVER I want a DVD that has the deleted footage. Rumors are out there that the first cut of this ran over 3 hours! The footage cut was made of the cast of the TV show cut out! I would like to see this stuff, Now in the future I want the following on ALL DVDS. Listen Every Movie has a first cut(before the re-shoots)Most of the time that cut runs longer! Now directors and studio heads release that version on the DVD AS WELL IN THE BONUS SECTION! THIS IS IN FACT WOULD BE A TRUE ASSET TO ANY DVD MOVIE LOVER COLLECTOR!"
1,WHO's the CRETIN who made the documentary on this DVD ?,"Nothing to say about The Lynch film itself or the transfer, They're perfect. But man DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. They were supposed to release it with over an hour of deleted scenes especially selected by Lynch himself and instead they put on a ""documentary"" made by WHO ? The boss of New Line's nephew ???I mean this thing is the stupidest attempt at a documentary I have ever seen in my life. (No wonder the director's name is omited). Instead of the deleted scenes they put the worstly edited interviews I have ever seen, and guess what the all actors are saying : Gee ! I was in a super nice scene that was cut from the final edit! ARRRRGH ! New Line get a grip and Issue a new version NOW !And to the Anonymous director of this farce. Cut the stupid fast forward on the interviews and GO BACK WORKING AT THE TACO BELL !"
3,A must see,"After enjoying the Season One of Twin Peaks I wanted answers to my many and varied questions! Fire Walk With Me goes some of the way to enlighten me.The other dimension aspect of Bob and the creepy little man ""Arm"" is a little crazy and although it might go some of the way to explain why Laura's life is so messed up and how she ended up dead - it raised many questions as well.Very enjoyable - better to watch the Twin Peaks episodes firstI think."
3,Competent retelling,"Stoutenberg competently retells the familiar stories of Paul Bunyan, Pecos Bill, Stormalong, Mike Fink, Davy Crockett, Johnny Applessed, John Henry, and Joe Magarac in a way that stresses the common tall tale elements and should be appealing to upper-elementary school readers. Useful in schools when balanced with some of the more recent and sprightlier stories featuring heroines."
4,"Somewhat outdated, but still true","Classic book. Loved the color illustrations. A little outdated, but still the things my stay at home daughter does every day.Granted the chores are now shared (hopefully). Still someone is doing them in the home. This is how parents take care of children. Its easy to adapt the child's situation while chatting about the pictures. Mommies can be doctors, mommies can go to work, daddies can stay home and fix dinner. Bought this at Christmas for my 2 year old granddaughter to go with her first baby doll. I always look for great illustrations in books for the very young, because I believe its important to pause through the reading to let the child express her thoughts in what I am saying and what she is seeing on the page. These pictures can be just a jumping off point for explaining how big people help to take care of little people."
3,confused....really confused,"O.k, i have come to the conclusion that there are two different versions of the ""Faces of death"" series: The ""authentic"" version, and the ""garbage re-run"" version. I first rented Faces of Death part 3 a while ago, and although alot of the footage was obviously fake, it was all NEW material exclusive to part 3. However, i just bought the video a couple weeks ago, and was shocked to see that it was nothing more than a few crappy scenes from parts 1 & 4, and a bit of stock footage from ""The many taboos of death"". This is quite strange as to why Gorgon video would put out a ""good"" version, and a cheap thrown together bad version. And apperantly, this is also true with parts 245 and 6. one has all material exclusive to that volume, and the other is just a bunch of re-run footage from earlyer ones. I suggest anyone who has this problem write to gorgon video or whoever it is that distributes this filler, and demand an explanation....."
3,Just got to buy it!!!,"I had only seen FOD 1, when I saw this. I'm just a sick Gore freak. Love horror films and the like, but this is more of a rush knowing that hidden in these dark and gory scenes are real scenes of death. The documentary element takes away some of the guilt of watching, but not all scenes are real, THEY DO CONTAIN SOME STAGED SCENE's. All in all I would recomend this to anyone who likes to be discusted, horrified, revoulted and even excited at the carnage they reveal. Not for the faint hearted or the squeemish. Don't take it too serious as anyone who is watching this type of film for the first time would/might not be able to distinguish the real from the fake."
1,a waste of 90 minutes,"a complete waste of time. don't get me wrong, horror is probably my favorite genre, but this goes waaaay beyond what is considered tasteful, possessing not a single solitary redeemable quality. executions, suicides, animals being murdered...entertainment, riiiight."
3,Not the best FOD,"Part one of this quadrilogy is a classic, part two is a big letdown. But three isnt all that bad but not great either. The fourth installment is really good even though it can be cheesy at times."
3,straightforward and earnest,"I admit that I found this book incredibly dull next to the three Motley Fool books I had read previously. I guess I just like some humor and irreverence -- this book is a bit too ""straight,"" although I suppose most investment specialists can't be comedians. The information is useful and well laid out, although I found the Motley Fool books more useful with more layman explanations of concepts like the P/E ratio. Sivy doesn't describe enough what these terms signify -- he pretty much tells you what things are.Anyway, he does provide some good solid information, it's just that other books out there do what he does and do it better. This book reads (surprise, surprise) like a long article in Money Magazine who Sivy writes for."
4,Sweetiststyle movie,While a little corny and not a top rated movie. Still John and Olivia team up again to give you a feel good love story with an Oh God type of flair. While many would probably say not Oscar material not all movies HAVE to be to be good.If you like love stories and John and Olivia then this movie is for you.
1,So terribly bad,"People desperately wanted to see Olivia and John reunite after the success of Grease. The dismal Grease 2 sequel came out with no sign of them, so someone had the idea of re-teaming them for something completely different. TWO OF A KIND is a silly plot about two people who are destined to meet thanks to the good lord above, and through some silly scenarios we are supposed to believe they will. The acting is absolutely shocking (not just from Olivia). Perhaps the only saving grace is the average single ""Twist of Fate"". This is not a cult classic, make no mistake. It is easily one of those ""hall of shame"" films. I cannot believe that there are reviewers out there who like this joke of a film."
3,Two popular stars just goofing around...,"Penniless inventor John Travolta, who owes money to some underworld types, decides to rob a bank but gets duped by the sassy Australian teller (guess who?), an aspiring actress who uses the stolen loot to do some SHOPPING! A fun, brainless doodle, ""Two of a Kind"" (terrible title!) fails to showcase Travolta or Olivia Newton-John to any particular advantage, but they do have a warm rapport and certainly look good together on-screen. The plot-thread with the goofy angels (and Gene Hackman as the voice of God) gets tiresome, the special effects are over-used, and the location at the film's climax is clearly a studio backlot, but there are some big laughs and Newton-John is very attractive. C+"
3,Simply the Best,"Man when I bought this set I was hoping for something that was really cool, gory, and cool effects and I was not dissapointed i love crocodile man i need to get the sequel. So Dudes WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR GO BUY THIS SET."
5,Great story by new author,"I coudn't put this book down, Favorable reviews by our book club. We found a lot to discuss."
4,Stratford-on-Avon Will Never Be The Same,"Martha Grimes's THE DIRTY DUCK takes Insp. Jury and his friends to Stratford-on-Avon. The birth place of Shakespease with is famous productions of his plays will never the the same if Harvey Schoenberg and his every present computer can prove Marlowe wrote the plays. Harvey will bend the ear of anyone who will listen to his theories and Melrose Plant is is chosen victim.Havey is a member of an American tourist group who's members are murder or disappear, but then Harvey himself is murdered. This is a convoluted tale that leaves even Scotland Yard's finest in the dark with a surprise ending that will have you asking, ""How did she do that?""The perfect crime fiction story with a Sharespearian touch.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH."
4,good quality all cotton tank,"I ordered several of these tanks and wear them to lead spin cycling classes. A slimmer cut would be more flattering. However, they cover the necessary bits, are comfortable and easy to wash and wear."
1,Why? Why!? WHY!?... A Disaster of a release,WHY did Janus(or whoever) butcher this??? This is unbelievably frustrating. No English for Toby?DO NOT PURCHASE.
4,Little Sister Review,"The book little sister was very easy to read, not only because it was smaller than most books i read, but it also hooked me into reading because you always wanted to know what was happening. The book had a very good plot, and it made lots of sense, it wasn't hard to read like some other books i have read before. Overall this book was very good, i would recommend it for anybody in between the ages of about nine to twelve. However during some parts i am confused by the authors style, because sometimes at the end of the paragraph she might say ""but i shouldn't get started on that quite yet""."
2,Buyer beware: Pickwick/Hallmark Records edition,"Great album, terrible recording. The Pickwick/Hallmark Records edition sounds like it was sourced from someone's old LP recorded straight to disc with all the pops, scratches, and clipping included. I wouldn't even mind if it was a good recording but it's not; it's thin and tinny. Stick to the Collector's Choice edition."
5,The Female Q,"I am a HUGE James Bond fan (especially if it's Pierce or Sean), and have always loved the gadgets he uses. So when this book came out, I HAD to read it. I liked it so much that I loaned it out to one of my co-workers. Favorite gadgets? The knock out lipstick and the shrink wrap condoms. I also wouldn't mind a a little vile of that truth serum perfume. Boy, would THAT come in handy at times. All in all, I thought it was a great read and laughed by butt off."
2,Watch GET SMART reruns instead.,"This wasn't the worst book I've ever read, but it comes close.All the gadgets and spoofs that were (I assume) supposed to be cute just came off stupid to me. I would rather have watched a GET SMART rerun. Sorry, but I cannot recommend this book."
3,Not after a year...,After about a year they start falling apart. Up to the year mark they were wonderful towels.
4,Bob kicks butt!!!!,Llloooovvvveeee iiiiitttt!!! I was looking for something to make me sweat...found it!! In the first 10 minutes. A few moves are a little difficult but great dvd!
3,more strength training than cardio,"This workout felt more like a strength training workout than cardio. Although I did feel it burned a lot of calories, I expected more elevated heart rate."
2,Didn't care for it,"I guess I'm in the minority of reviewers, but I really didn't care for this workout. It was severely lacking in the fun factor department for me. It felt very repetitive (I know squats and lunges are effective, but that doesn't mean that I want to do them over and over for minutes at a time without switching things up a bit.) I do feel that it's a strong and effective workout, I just prefer my workouts have more variety of moves and well, that they are fun. This is a workout that I would dread doing again, so I will be passing my DVD onto someone else who may enjoy it."
3,Dictionary,"Xactly - just a Dict, nothin else, no synopsis just VERY short Xplanations of characters, situations and names. not worth $ U would pay, find anThr 1."
5,The Sinking of the Eastland,"I heard the author interviewed on WGN radio and this story sounded so interesting and it is. It is amazing that a ship cap sized in the Chicago river, downtown and no one knows the history or the story. We all know about the Chicago fire but this story is a much larger and sadder tragedy. Very good book, you get the feeling you knew the families.If you are a history buff especially Illinois or Midwest history this is a must read."
4,"Reira, llorara y volverá a reir sin parar...",Barbara Johnson es una mujer ejemplar que ha ayudado a miles de mujeres en America a sobrellevar los problemas de la vida diaria que uno como Cristiano tiene que afrontar. No conozco de muchas personas que tengan la Gracia de Dios para compartir sus dolores y crisis familiares con una sonrisa en el corazon que se refleja en risas. Los dibujos le ayudaran a recordar las anecdotas y enseñanzas. Mi esposa tiene copias en el refrigerador y ha regalado a varias sus amigas. Recomendable para mujeres (y varones) en momentos de transición.
2,Not a great choice,"This item was intended to be a gift, and the actual packaging looked much more like standard shampoo and not the bottle that's shown. The scent was not very appealing, and it arrived leaking. Went to the store and bought something nicer (though smaller) for the same price."
2,Not what I thought,"This book was not what I thought it would be. Instead of delving in to strong characters, the Moon family women were given the impression that they were cauldren stirring vixens with a supernatural power to hypnotically lure any male in to their bedroom. It was ridiculous and the lack of detail left me wondering how the author got away with this one.There is no meat on this bone. The dark storyline lacked plot and purpose and was terribly unbelievable.If you are looking for a book with strong southern female characters and storyline... don't look here. The only thing you will get is egotistical swamp witches with a hideous ending."
4,Drink the Blood of the Rosary for Christ Has...Whatever.,"Viewed: 10/03, 7/12Rate: 77/12: More reasons to hate the church and support the atheism movement. So much hypocrisy about its silly institution and ""oh sacred"" rules. So...the church itself is more important than the value of people's lives. That's great. No wonder why child sex abuse lasted for so long. Take a look at the Joe Paterno mess: Penn State is more important than the raped children. For all its worth, Donald Sutherland turns in another masterful performance, and it's the only reason why I see The Rosary Murders. All in all, The Rosary Murders is a nice little thriller, but I am still peeved by the idea of a confessional being inviolable. I am dropping its rating from `8' to `7'."
1,Beware!,"Back in October I purchased a DVD from Amazon.com and when I received it in the mail and tried to play it on my player, I was informed that this DVD could not be played in my region (the United States). I was never so upset and mad than I was over that! This kind of information should be made available when a person is considering purchasing this, not after they have bought and paid for it."
3,"not only ""The ransom of Red Chief""","In this movie, part of the plot has been compared to the O'Henry story ""The Ransom of Red Chief"" , involving a kidnapped child. However, it remined me of another O'Henry story called ""A Retrieved Reformation"". In this story, a reformed safecraker named Jimmy Valentine must reveal himself when a child gets accidently locked in a bank vault."
5,Kids Force Bank Robbers To Kidnap The Kids,"Funny. Adventurous. Crime doesn't pay, but crime skills save a life. No cussing. No using God's name in vain. Real crooks get punished."
2,Installs more than Mavis Beacon!,"Beware.I bought this software to replace a 10 year old version. This CD release installs all kinds of ad-ware on your computer including Net-zero Browser, Browser toolbars, and Ad Pop-ups. If you register the program (the only way to get it to work) you will suddenly start getting hundreds of advertisement emails. Hmmm.The install does not work correctly and you will have to search for the Mavis Beacon program and create a shortcut to it on your desktop. Otherwise the program will not run.The whole install will piss you off. Garbage strewn all over your drive and in the system registry. Be sure to search for all files created on your system at the time and date of the install. That way you can search and delete the mess.The worst part is your email address being sold to anyone hawking their wares. CAUTION. Use or create a throw-away email address.Otherwise the typing part works as expected.JP"
1,Broderbund hasn't a clue,"Tried using this software with Windows-XP and had LOTS of problems. Then trying to use their ""money back guarantee"" is a real pain. Follow their web site links and one page tells you not to send it back to them but to go to the retailer, while another says you should send it back to them. Finding a phone number to get the right answer or even an email address is impossible. Broderbund doesn't know what customer support is. Avoid their software if you can."
1,Love Love Love - NOT!!!!,Love is lovely love is loving lovely is taking love is giving - I made that last poem up by myself. I do not recommend this book unless you are a hardcore danielle steel fan and then of course I recommend every ot her book by her for your collection. I found the poems to be light and tright and not out of sight and not at all full of delight. IF you are searching for good amorous poetry might I suggest Elizabeth Barret Browning or perhaps Pablo Neruda. This is a book that one might want to access if one cannot find a hallmark card good enough for one's significant other. I don't want to be harsh...but lets not call this poetry.
1,One star is one star too many,"This book makes me wish that Amazon had a ""zero star"" option.Not only are the poems bad, but I hate that stupid zig-zaggy style she uses in printing her poetry."
5,A good starter program,I use this program and use much heavier weights than a beginner would as I have exercised for years but I think this is suitable for beginners and also the stomach exercises are done standing as is the rest of the workout which is great for people who have a hard time getting up and down off the floor. Also you can use no weights or light weights or like me heavy weights. I dont do the stomach exercises as they are not effective for me as I am advanced and have rock hard abs but I do recommend this for people just starting out to lay a good foundation for her other programs. This is a good program and recommended.
5,My man Zoot,"Mr. Sims makes this fluid instrument come alive and take on a life of its own. His timing is next to none and the improvisations are second only to Mr. Sims' mastery of his instrument. A lesson some of today's Jazz dabbliers could take note of. Oh do not get me wrong there are some very good Sax players out there in the Jazz world today, but today's Jazz has become somewhat ""cookie cutter"" in its presentation, or too commercialized.This is a 1973 recording, but it is very relevent to the standards of Jazz, without which there would be something missing in Jazz. You do not have to be an old timer to appreciate the sound Mr. Sims is putting out, just a Jazz lover. Give this CD a listen, it is moving."
1,Good price does not mean bad jobs done in a movie,"The original movies were good, the DVD technique mastered seems to me was from a VCD or from VHS tape used 1000 times. No one could have done such a bad job. The sounds are hollow on ""The Chinese Connection"" with a full screen format which blows up the picture where not much to see. ""The Fists of Fury"" is OK with the sound, but still so grainly that I wish I never had these movies."
2,Is this the best master they could dub from?,"I would have liked to have seen this film in its original state and not the saturday afternoon TV version that I received. The master in which they used to make this DVD has scratches all over it. I cannot believe that this was best available master. It's a shame, because the movie is fantastic."
3,Awful dubbing takes away from Lee's performance.,"Oddly, this DVD release of ""The Chinese Connection"" lists the audio track as Chinese language with subtitles. Not the case, as I found out. The DVD contains the same gosh-awful English language dubbing as the theatrical release that most people saw in American theaters. You know, the sort of dubbing typical of most kung fu flicks where it sounds as if one guy did the voices for ten characters in the movie. In any event, it's tolerable in ""The Chinese Connection"" as this DVD release does feature the widescreen format.A good addition for Bruce Lee fans."
1,How about zero stars?,"It's a good thing I only paid $3.00 for this at Goodwill. As everyone says, the quality sucks and the vocal quality in Chinese Connection is inexcusable...Bruce has a voice like lurch. What the hell were the jerks at Madacy thinking? Lee would reach in their rib cages and rip out their hearts!"
1,Do Not Buy This Version,I love these movies. Storyline and action are great. The dubs on this version however are terrible. I am pretty sure that this version was simply copied from VHS because near the end of The Chinese Connection (the one with the ice factory) you can see problems with tracking. This is also where you begin losing the sound quality as it speeds up and slows down. This collection makes me sad. Shame on Madacy Entertainment and may God have mercy on their souls for this unspeakable abomination.
4,chinese connection,"loved the movie although it was a little lighter than i remember meaning that you could see it lost some color/clarity as a copy of the original. Worth buying delivery was a little slow, and the packaging that it arrived in was just acceptible overall a good experience and i would order from them again..."
2,Just look at these ratings you imbecile!!,"Well, they've all said the same things. The picture quality will make you nauseaous and the sound is so poor it is dificult (read:impossible) to make out what the characters are saying. As they say ""You get what you pay for."" Do yourself a favor and run far, far from away from this horrible collection. The only reason I gave it as many as two stars (a horrible rating even when earned) is because I fealt it blasphemous to give Bruce Lee movies and less. You have been warned!!"
1,Deserves ZERO Rating,"The quality of this DVD is horrible and I hope anyone reading my review heeds my advice ""DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!"" I am a huge fan of Bruce Lee and Fists of Fury & The Chinese Connection are two of my favorite Bruce Lee movies, but even Bruce's greatness couldn't make up for the poor sound and distorted picture. The picture looked, at times, like I needed to adjust my tracking (this was a DVD remember?). I own the same two movies on VHS, that I purchased at least 10 years ago and the quality blows this DVD away. If I could give a ZERO RATING I would give this DVD a DOUBLE ZERO RATING!!!!"
2,"American DVD review only, not the movie.",The Chinese Connection was the American release name of The Fist of Fury. The American release is edited and badly dubbed. Search for the import release known as The Fist of Fury. The picture and soundtrack is restored and it's formatted properly. The WB releases are sub-par and the import discs are about the same price.
4,pretty good i suppose,"The fist of fury is a pretty good film the english translation was annoying but thats the reason why i gave it only 4 stars. Some of the martial arts screaming is pretty funny and intense. overall it is a great film,if you like the martial arts in The Matrix you love the martial arts in this."
3,HYSTERICAL!!!,"Even though the dvd is so horrid quality wise, it's absolutely hysterical. It is such a joke; the video and audio are so horrendous that it's funny, and the trivia questions are so bland I think my apendex exploded from laughter. If you have a couple of bucks, pick it up; it's worth a couple laughs. But if you are conservative of your money and serious about bruce lee, avoid this little ""gem"" like plaque my friend."
3,Sound is bad but the movie is good,The voices are dubed in and it is in a deep voice but there a some great fight seens but if you want to see a really good Bruce Lee movie get Enter the Dragon.The Chinese Connection is still a good movie
2,"Visually impressive, but incoherent","I usually try to begin my reviews with a brief, neutral description of the plot, but in this case I have to make an exception. Pulling a coherent narrative out of this mess would require more effort on my part than writer / director Richard Kelly apparently made to put one in.There are some excellent visuals here and it can be fun to play ""spot the recognizable character actor,"" but I'll be darned if I know what it was about. With so many pointless and inconclusive subplots going on, I just became bored after a while, but I stuck it out to the end, which left me unenlightened. I even watched the credits roll, at the end of which I saw that there is a trilogy of graphic novels that precede the film. Would they help to make sense of what I saw? Can't say I care much anymore."
1,One Of The Worst Films Ever Made.,"Seriously, this is a completely incoherent, confused piece of garbage. Badly acted, badly written and badly directed. If your idea of fun is watching The Rock ""act"" for 2 1/2 hours, then this movie will be right up your alley. You keep thinking it has to get better, has to make sense at some point. But it never does."
1,Rare Garbage,"It's rare to find moving video this bad. I can't call this a film. I have finally found something to which I can say, ""I'd rather watch paint dry,"" and be believable because I'm simply being honest."
2,I never finished watching,"I had great hopes for this one: look at the cast! As a matter of fact, I'll watch anything with Dwayne Johnson in it - Rock On! But this dystopian satire began to look too much like a Saturday Night Live sketch gone wrong. As it jerked along going nowhere, I lost interest. So much possibility, so miserable an outcome. Sad. Really sad."
4,You can't make life last forever,An excelent way to explain that time and life are the same thing. Would you change your normal life for a longer one? try to think about people who get older and you keep being young.One of the things that money can buy is timelife and you will see it in this movie.
3,Ok but not great,"This is a decent horror movie, but not among the best of the genre. On the positive side:+ General craft is on the high end+ Direction is almost top notch+ Federico Luppi really delivers (as usual).On the negative side:- While the story is not uninteresting, the starting point is implausible and the development not very logical.- The little girl character does not work.Interestingly, this movie is bilingual (English and Spanish)."
2,Not THAT great . . .,"Title says it; all songs freely available elsewhere, save ""Love Or Let Me Be Lonely,"" which seems a little obscure."
1,Another disappointment,"I keep reading DS novels because I used to love her books. Either my taste in reading is changing, or her books are getting worse. This particular story line has been done before and done better. Stephanie Powers starred in the movie version. Anybody remember the author? Bottom line---the book had its moments, but sheesh....enough already about how nobody can tell them apart! Personally I think it's strange, and even a little sick, that they always dress the same. Victoria is selfish, Olivia is boring and Charles is a wimp. So who cares about them.....I don't. But if DS writes another novel, I'll probably read it. I just keep hoping....."
3,how to tell the twins apart,"If the twins are truly "" mirror image "" One would be left handed and one would be right handed. Not too hard then to tell them apart."
4,Typical Steel book,"This is a typical Danielle Steel book, but much too long for the story told. The first 2/3 of the book was all leading up to the core of the story. Maybe it is the season of the year and having too much to do, but it took me a long time to read this book. I wasn't completely satisfied by the ending. Once it started to end, it came too quickly."
4,Mirror Image was boring to me,"Honestly, I don't remember much of this book except that the twins were mirror twins or something and the only detail that stuck in my mind was that one of the character's wife died on the Titanic, I only remember that because the historical detail caught my attention. Other then that the 600 or so pages could have been blank for all I remember or care. Don't get me wrong, she's written books I've loved. This just was most definetly not one of them. Some books of her's I like are Malice, Loving and Jewels and I've seen the movie adaption of The Ring which was really good."
5,mirror image,I was recommended to read this book and i'm glad i did once i started reading it i couldn't put it down was a very exciting book and i would read it again.
2,Not so great,The razor did not do a good job shaving my neck and took much longer than my previous razor. Not worth the money.
2,Disappaointment!,"My old Norelco rotary stopped working so I thought I will replace that with a similar priced shaver like a Panasonic or Braun shaver and bought this one a while ago. What a disappointment!While it is ok (and comfortable) for regular shaving on the face (daily shaving - if you let it grow a little more then it is a little more painful since Braun seems to pluck the hair out..), shaving in the neck area is a lot worse than Norelco. Even after several minutes of trying I couldn't get all the hair in neck area cleaned out. Norelco also takes a couple of tries, but this one didn't work even after 10 tries.I tried wet shaving next to see if that helps. That also didn't help. So I returned it back to Amazon.Pros: price, construction quality, handlingCons: sound, not able to handle neck hair."
3,"Shaver Good, Long Hair Trimmer Bad","I have been using Braun electric shavers for 22 years. This Braun 370 Shaver would have been my 3rd Braun shaver. (My last one, Braun 7526, I accidently dropped in water.)The shaving device of the Braun 370 worked great as always, but the long hair trimming device on this model (370) is different than my last 2 Braun shavers.The long hair trimmer kept cutting me. I also used to use my old Braun shavers to trim the hairs on the back of my neck, but I found the new Braun 370 was hard to use because they changed the design of the long hair trimmer which made it difficult to see where you were cutting on the back of your neck.I returned the Braun 370 shaver back to Braun, since Braun has a 60 day trial, and purchased another Braun shaver that has the same long hair trimming device as my 2 old Braun shavers.I hope this helps. Thanks."
4,My first Electric Shaver,"Took me a while to catch up and get one of these gadgets. I had tried a couple in the past and none seemed to be as quick and easy as a disposable Mach3 or Quattro. I think I paid less money for this shaver (on sale here at Amazon) than I have spent on replaceable Quattro blades in the past six months.It does a good job and I am getting used to it after a month now. I do not have a heavy beard, but I suppose I have some strange hair growth pattern on my neck, so that takes me a little longer. I am satisfied with the Contour and recommended it to a friend who also purchased one."
2,Braun Shaver 5775,"The shaving head is quite good, but the side trimmer is difficult to use. Also this unit had a problem within a week. The battery is charged with a special cord. When the battery is being charged the shaver does not function. My unit was defective in that it would not charge the battery. Had to send it back to a service facility, warranty repair, and will be without the shaver for 2-4 weeks."
4,Nice Razor Poor trimmer,"The razor is holding up well shaves well and is water proof. Holds a good charge, reasonably priced compared to other razors that you need almost a car payment to purchased. The trimmer is poor so I have a separate device due to having a mustache. It would have been 5 stars if not for the trimmer."
3,ok for the price,"I have been using electric shavers for over 50 years. This is my first Braun. A lot depends on 3 things, facial shape, type of whiskers(fuzz, course etc)and skin type. This shaver is ok for the price. It took me at least twice as long to get a shave that was ALMOST equal to my Norelco. Like I said, it depends on the 3 things above. May return it or let my son try it and see."
3,"Great service from Amazon, but a disappointing item","The service from Amazon was fine, but this was my third Braun series razor. Each time I have wanted to get the original, but each time I was limited to buying the new/improved model. My first one lasted a long time and I was hoping to get it again. The second one was purchased at a Walgreen's I believe because it was the last/only one they had and while it appeared to be a bit of an upgrade, it did not last even a year. This one was better, but still different and it is starting to make the same rattling noise the other two did. I liked the shave best with my first one, but the foils did not seem to last long enough. The current one seems to have a better foil than either of the first two, at least is not cutting the bottom of my nose or my ears.I think my next product will be another brand. I like Braun but buying a new one every 1-2 years is not the durability I expected."
4,"Good cutters, a little small for cookies","I bought these items for my son's birthday. A friend of mine was baking a cake with the ""zoo"" theme and the cutters were used to cut the fondant decorations to go on the sides of the cake. For that use they worked great. Cake was a huge success. Some of the cutter figures are too narrow and may not work for sticky or thicker doughs like cookie dough. But as I mentioned, for a thin layer of fondant they worked perfectly."
4,Good movies,"I like ""The Beyond "" better than ""house by the Cemtary"". But both are good films . My main point of this reveiw is to let you people know that ""the Beyond"" can be found in best buy for $9.99 and ""house by the cemetary"" can be found really anywhere for $6.99. So im just trying to save you money instead of spendingjust over $20 for the 2 you can spend about 14 or 15 $."
3,Item ok,Item was good but not really what I was looking for. but we made it work. We will come back and try to find the right staple for next year.
2,It's great sin; it's boring.,"John Updike's one attempt at playwriting, BUCHANAN DYING is one of those mistakes that only a great writer can make. Looking at the rather poor legacy of Buchanan, Lincoln's ineffectual predecessor, Updike gives us a dying man, gazing back at his life and trying to find some comfort in his accomplishments, but instead he is haunted by his failures. Filled with historical figures that history itself has condemned to anonymity; Updike's play fails for the worst of all reasons; it's boring. Well-researched with an earnest attempt at finding an emotional center to one of history's ciphers, but still boring.Occasionally a scene grabs your interest, but they are few and far between. I can't even imagine sitting through a staging of this work without wanting to escape."
4,Florida at it's best (and worst),"As a Florida native, I've lived with mosquitos my whole life. The title of this book, The Mosquito Wars, says it all. Reading it, I was delighted to learn about the people, science, military influence, back-room politics, and environmental impacts that were all part of Florida's efforts to control mosquitos. Now, each time I slap a skeeter, the whole history of the mosquito wars resonates with the slap."
4,Very interesting to know how we can improve efficiency in our decision process,"Having worked with customers on consulting engagements for evaluating options among different products and solutions I found many times we ended up picking the one we thought most likely with our first impression. This book provided me with some arguments to know why we thought so and that trusting our judgement could lead us to the same place after a structured selection process.The book provides a model for decision making (the RPD - Recognition Primed Decision model) that experts use in time pressured situations (firemen chiefs, combat pilots, chess masters).Reading it easy but it has many references so studying it could be burdensome.I highly recommend the book if you liked Blink and if you want to be more efficient in making decisions without thinking trusting your judgement or intuition is a mistake."
5,"Tela is the ""incredible""guy","There are no time-wasters on here--even the intro & outro sound amazing! The pimptastic tracks go down reaaal smooth.The most familiar songs are ""incredible,"" ""coco,"" ""tennessee titans,"" and ""pimp b*tch.""Unlike many rappers today, Tela sounds great alone (ex: ""double dose,"" my favorite track); Devin the Dude, Jazzy Pha, and the other guests are hot fudge on Tela's ice cream.Buy this CD; it's good."
3,Good product,Shipped quickly! No issues. However the wand is smaller than I'd thoughtBut it gets the job done thanks for a great experience.
1,not very pleased withthis item..sorry,"Item didnt work properly. could only put on low heat, otherwise blow dryer would cut off. Needless to say, i wasnt happy withthe outcome..Hair was still damp and not straight enough. I had to go to CVS and purchase one of theirs which is different and worked just fine"
5,"Heck yeah, that's entertainment","Let me be the first (ok, the second) to tell you how great this single is. Way back when, the Old 97's got under my skin and now they are a part of who I am. This single just goes to prove how much the band has waitied for their ""big break"" and hopefully ""19"" will be it. Sure we've seen the boys on Conan, now let's get them into the big time! Come on, Texas! Buy this CD!"
2,There is Life on Mars,"Although I may have known in heart some of things that are in the book it helps to see them in print.Perhaps what I believe we need to do is to do books like this for those families who live below the median income in countries across the world. I live in Jamaica and fortunately I can pay to dream some of the new dreams, not all.The challenges that women with children with disablities who live below the median income are awesome. For those living in developing countries like Jamaica they are moreso.While the focus should be on dreaming new dreams. They need also be about dreaming but not doing. There should be something here about advocacy and why for those new dreams to happen we must advocate that could have been an emphasis.This book makes the assumption that you can afford to sleep and to dream, some of our mothers are in a nightmare and they need more on how to move to the zone of celebration than this book gives."
4,Very Insightful and Interesting,"I bought this book with the high hopes of learning more about foraging from the sea, and I chose correctly. Euell Gibbons is a master and the illustrations are clear and precise. I was amazed at how well this book was put together. You get key information on each animal such as where they live, best ways to catch them, and best of all recipes. The only thing I would have negative to say about it is that the recipes are in paragraph form along with the descriptions. Granted they are not hard recipes but if you want to find them you have to skim through the whole chapter. Other than that the book was excellent."
2,They were right to stop it here,"This prequel is a lot like the first sequel(though why this deserved an 18 certificate unlike that one I don't know).Sure,there are some fantastic action sequences,with explosions,gunfights and chases galore.But Stallone is as mysteriously wooden as he was in the before sequel.In the original First Blood,he spent the majority of the film being wooden as well,but then right at the very end when the he runs into Richard Crenna's colnell character,he explodes into an endless turrey of emotions,which explain why he spends most of the film in a blank,trance-like state.Here,and in FB Part 2,he is simply deprived of expression throughout.Also,the movie lacks engaging dialogue and a solid central villain.Worth watching perhaps for the exciting bits,but you can leave your brain in neutral throughout.Don't forget Crenna made his own self mocking appearance in this film's parody Hot Shots!Part Deux."
2,Best of it kind !,"Best of it kind in the weard fealds of propaganda warfear . I think it is "" out of stock "" for the next few years .Pure , pure "" freadom fighters "" whom we trained and supported ... watching the blue sky ... waiting for freadom ...TODAY : same "" freadom fighters "" whom we trained and supported... watching the amty blue sky on the place , were WTC use to stay , including the souls of thouthands of innocent people .The best example of government using Holliwood in brainwashing sistem ."
3,Problem more with Amazon than the movie.,Movie is great. Movie showed up with a broken case and without the Ultimate Edition case sleeve that comes on the movie if you buy it in the store. I would recomend this movie but buy it in a store and not from Amazon.
4,STALLONE RAMBO 3 IN DISPLAY VHS FULL SCREEN,BECAUSE last one send me digitally remaster didn't like it wide screen 1998 want it first came out blue sky hilecopter letters in red looks in the picture and like it full screen Please doesnt matter is old tape IVE of 1988 really prechated for your certery attention store Amazon for best entertanment.
2,"Some good info, but seems biased","The Fanthorpes explore the Rennes mystery, and offer some good information in this book. However, it isn't always presented clearly and some of the theories and conclusions they draw from it don't seem fully supported. I was left with the impression that the book was half Rennes investigation, and half platform from which to denounce Holy Blood, Holy Grail. It's not surprising (given Lionel's clergy background) that they would disagree with Holy Blood, Holy Grail's conclusions. But this potential bias must be remembered when reading it, and their dismissive tone when talking about some of the more controversial theories about Rennes needs to be taken with a corresponding grain of salt. If they offered counter-evidence convincingly presented, that would be a different matter. Instead, their otherwise interesting investigation seems marred by jabs at other investigators...usually countering other investigators' arguments with faith instead of evidence."
2,Disappointed repeat customer,"My husband and I just ordered two Warmrails Kensington Towel warmers. We already have three in another home and love the way they work and look! However, upon opening the box, we were very disappointed to see that the ""satin nickel"" isn't the metal but rather a color painted on. The coating is so thin that one warmer came with scratches already through the paint. We chose ""satin nickel"" to match the finish on the fixtures in the bathrooms, but this finish is very different from the normal satin nickel finish. Did Kensington cheapen their product or did we get a ""knock-off""? The rating would be a '5' if the product was the quality that we previously purchased. This is truly buyer beware!"
5,Warmrails Kensington Towel Warmer,"Warmrails kept towels at just the correct warmnest in our home for 8 years......Now that we have moved, nothing but Warmrails could keep out towels ready for us after the baths. Now, the people who purchased our home have their towels at the right temperture. We're all lucky to have this product."
4,A very touching movie,"This movie is about how people turn to prostitution because they feel they have no choice. It made me realize how bad some peoples lives are, and how much people on the streets need our help."
2,emurata,"DVD quick arrival appreciated. When viewing the DVD, I was surprised at the poor quality. There was ""snow"" or black dots/spots in the scenes and even a ""slash"" in one of the frames. It looked like something I could have copied from theTV myself - not expected from so called professionals."
4,Absorbing creation of a world similar to this,"The writer has an irritating habit of not quite completing scenes and leaving rather too much to the imagination of the reader. None the less this is an absorbing story of (guess what) good against evil, aliens versus humans. The humans are well characterized and made sympathetic. I enjoyed the book and look forward to reading book 2"
2,Broken Crown,"Although this book lets the reader enter a richly textured world, West introduces too many characters to keep straight. The characters blur after a while, and the plot remains very static. I only got half way through the book before getting bored. I hope that West continues to write about her alternate world with greater regard for plot."
5,Very useful,"I used this on my brows, back of my neck and face. Works well for the price. I would highly recommend."
4,You Have a Story to Tell,"If you want to record your memories, but don't know how to begin, this book prompts you to start. Whether you are writing your story or taping it for your family, getting started can be the hardest part.Here are some samples from the book:*Take us with you when you had to move from one home to another*Can you remember the first person you ever had a crush on?*Can you remember a time when you got lost?*Take us with you to a movie when you were a child or teenagerInterspersed with these memory prompts are suggestions for using them. Besides telling your own stories, the prompts could be used to draw out memories from someone in a nursing home. The author recommends ways to enhance your stories such as adding in smell, taste, touch, and sound.The book is 127 small pages, with many pages having just a prompt on it. This makes it nicely portable, but means it is not comprehensive. I'd recommend supplementing it with some other books on the topic."
1,Bad kindle sample,No real sample for this book. Basic intro. When will authors and publishers understand people will buy books when they have at a least a chance to get a sense for the book. Hook me with the book. Don't just provide a foreword or jacket copy.
3,Not the best collection of its type,"The title is a bit of a joke because the book is actually quite small in the physical sense. Basically it is a list of words (primarily English language words) that seem to fit into a range of categories that can be general (male parts) or very specific (tasty terms). Some lists are set up as charts that focus on the play with one phrase or rhyme systems. The picture throughout could be funny or distracting depending on your personal taste -- I found them a bit of both. Once more we see that in the English language words relating to women's bodies and sexuality are fewer and less ""active"". It could be fun to read with friends but since no real definitions are offered for the terms, not very helpful to writers I think."
1,Bergner betrayed trusting prisoners.,"Author Bergner gained the confidence of several prisoners in Angola Prison who told him things that would turn their lives into hell if the authorities of the prison were to learn off them. Bergner writes, ""I was sickened, too, by the immediate knowledge that I would write everything he told me, and that my words would probably cost him years at Camp J."" This is a place Bergner describes as receiving no natural light or circulating air, a place where prisoners are only allowed a few hours a week outdoors in a small dog run. Bergner sentenced these men to this hell so that he could publish this mediocre book. I'm sorry I participated."
2,Bad sound !,"The recording quality is quite low for a 2000 record. There are some good versions (only europa knows, frost flowers...) and bad things (Fields of rape, death of the west...). Expensive for what it is. Ugly look. Not really worth the price."
4,Try to wrap your head around this,"This book on Nietzsche is interesting as a secondary source in that Jaspers was a serious philosopher and not just a scholar. So, his writing is an attempt to come to grips with the meaning of Nietzsche's corpus philosophically and existentially rather than just exegesis. It has a rhythm and pace that is unique and original. But, one has also to consider that Jaspers wrote this book before the world really understood what Nietzsche was trying to do. So, you might not get straight answers here but the journey is worthwhile."
5,Faithful to the original!,"Our 7th grade literature book has Kipling's original story ""Rikki-tikki-tavi"" in it. The students enjoy the story and I like showing the video after they have studied it. We discuss portrayal of Rikki (pics in the text don't show mongooses as quite so adorable as the animated Rikki), as well as of Nag and Nagaina. This video is so particularly useful because it is faithful to the original story, not changing endings or characters or events in any significant way. Well worth having!"
4,Fun holiday entertainment,"Fond memories. LOVE the Cricket stories!!! Added to our lineup of Christmas 'specials' to watch as a family. RikiTiki is a bit intense for youngest viewers...the snake still is scary after 40 years! And the white seal one is WAY too intense. But the 3 Cricket movies are fun, holiday enteratinment for the whole family. Highly recommend!"
1,"Author needs to ""get a life.""","I glanced into this book recently at my corner Sav-On Drug Store while waiting for a prescription to be filled. As I read, I kept thinking that it is unbelievable that someone could write such awful stuff and then put it out there for others. Why has Mr. Roberts put so much effort to remember a seemingly ordinary if not even somewhat spoiled woman? The passages I read were truly terrible as I continued to search for something remarkable about her and their life together as husband and wife.Having no knowledge of the Roberts family, it nevertheless seems to me that with his obvious financial resources (vanity press publication)he might have used them in a humanitarian way rather than writing a miserable memoire about a no way exceptional person. Remember My Jo is best forgotten!"
3,WELL HONEY!,"I gotta say being the girlfriend of a perverted 'man', 'animal', 'dog', whatever you want to call him, is not easy. Maybe I should write a book on how to keep your perverted man under your wings. This book has great jokes and awesome to read on long plane rides, laugh real loud and annoy your neighbours. Vulgar, very much so. I'm surprised your mom didn't wash your mouth with clorox detergent yet, babe."
2,I don't know...,"I don't know if I could classify this as god or bad. It is good that they featured some of the best artists but.... their renditions are not that good. I think there are just a few good songs in this album like Beauty & the Beast and etc. Maybe if you're planning to get this CD, maybe you should get the more recent volumes (Disneymania 2 & 3)."
2,Ehhh...save your money,"This CD would be good for younger kids (I'm 14), but it's not that great to me. The best song is definintly S Club's remake of ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight""- it's amazing! Other bearable songs include ""Colors of the Wind"" by Ashanti and ""You'll Be In My Heart"" by Usher..."
4,It grows on you,"At first, I was disappointed with these new versions of classic Disney songs, but the more I've listened to it, the more I've come to enjoy it. Even the destruction of the beautiful love ballad Beauty and the Beast can be sung with despite the faster pace. Though I'm not an Aaron Carter fanatic, I just can't wait to be king is pretty similar to Elton John's pop version and still has that ""oldies sound"" that made me love the original version so much. Hilary Duff's Tiki Room is my favorite on the disc. All in all, this isn't a bad set of songs. For the most part, the artists have stuck to the original melodies while at the same time adding their own styles to the mix. Some tunes will grind on the ears of true Disney music enthusiasts, but I don't regret buying the CD."
3,Keep an open Mind,"Ms. Green presents some wonderful ideas about keeping an open heart, and the amazing benefits of doing so. A great book for someone who wants to feel more love in his/her life. Unfortunately, she claims that this came from a series of visits with Jesus. Well, I guess this could happen, may have happened to many. However, she claims to have ALSO answered the questions which have plagued scholars for centuries - what happened when Christ died? Did Jesus marry Mary? Where did she go afterward. There is more misinformation here than good information. So, keep what you want and discard the rest. For me, I really couldn't get past my cynic-mind."
4,60 years of a variety of music,Capitol records has been bringing music fans the very best in all kinds of music. Putting a collection of 60 years worth of music is no easy task and I think the label did a very good job on the selections. This is a must have especially for the collectors.
5,Best ice cream you'll ever have,"I bought this product on a really hot summer day when I was craving ice cream but wanted something fat-free and sugar-free and finding a product like that in the store seems impossible. This machine is awesome! Not only did it make delicious fat free, sugar free ice cream, it also made amazing real ice cream! The recipe book it comes with has lots of great flavors you can make and with a little creativity you can make many more! The product works well, is super easy to use, cleans up with warm water and is something I find myself using all the time. If you buy this, you won't be disappointed. My only advice is keep the cylinder in the freezer all the time. That way, you never have to wait to have homemade ice cream in minutes!"
2,A disappointing purchase,The Hamilton Beach Ice cream maker is going to be a disappointment if you are attempting to make ice cream in a warm climate (such as here in Key West ) without the AC turned on. I couldnt get the HB to get the ice cream cold enough even though the container was cooled in the freezer at maximum setting for 48 hours and was additionally insulated with a towel. It ended up as soft ice cream. I cant recommend this product.
4,Actually interesting,"I learned things about Lewis' and Freud's religious beliefs I didn't know I wanted to learn, like that JRR Tolkien is actually a Christian (a little less obvious than with Lewis' Narnia series).The downside is that the book at least seems to be very biased. It's difficult to tell if the author is biased or if the book just makes it so blatantly obvious how absurd it can be to be an atheist.Nevertheless, enthralling with such interesting trivia!"
4,The Question of God,The book was everything I was looking for. It presented both sides pretty fairly and explained how the personal experiences of Freud and Lewis may have affected their outlooks and beliefs. It was an engaging read throughout.
1,FYI,"For those of you seeking INDUSTRIAL MUSIC, please be informed that this artist is NOT Clause Larsen (Leaether Strip), but an EBM project by a completely DIFFERENT artist using the SAME NAME by coincidence. This is the reason that he (Claus) changed the spelling from KLUTE to KLUTAE.Note: This is NOT a REVEIW, I'm posting this to eliviate confusion among shoppers."
4,Great program ... just needs better add-ons,"I've been a loyal user of Mastercook through a total of 5 different versions. I've loved each version because they fitted what I need.I was excited about Mastercook 9's newest add-on and it's so easy to add recipes now. However, I don't use internet explorer so it'd be very helpful if they included an add-on for netscape and firefox."
5,MasterCook Deluxe 9.0,"The recipient did not let me know how she liked it, but since she asked for it and didn't send it back, I gave it 5 stars."
1,program is buggy,I have version 9.0.00.20. It is basically unusable. Customer service by Valusoft is about the worst I have run into. Recommend avoiding the program until they get it fixed.
5,MasterCook Deluxe,I am very pleased with the 9th edition of MasterCook. It is nice to know it is being updated from time to time after Sierra stopped publishing it. I am also glad it can be installed using Vista. I have had MasterCook for years and have added my own cookbook of nearly 650 recipes through time. It is very easy to use. I highly recommend it.
1,Shopping list causes entire program to crash,"I purchased this product specifically for the shopping list feature. Unfortunately, it froze repeatedly while I was building my first list and I had to re-enter some of my data a couple of times. I REALLY wanted it to work so I kept at it. When I finally got my whole list entered and did a final save before I printed it, the entire program crashed and I lost all of my work (even though I had saved faithfully) AND all the cookbooks have disappeared. Very strange.I removed it from my computer and do not plan to try again."
1,Not any good to me.,I am very dissapointed in this program. I was so excited about getting it to help me with figuring nutritional values of my own recipes as well as trying new ones. I cannot get the program to load on my computer. Have tried all the problem solvers and troubleshooting and get no where. Contacted the tech people and get no help. I have tried everything they say and NOTHING has helped. Buyer beware!
2,not what I thought it would be,"I got this program a couple of weeks ago and so far I hate it. My biggest pet peeve is that it alphabitizes everything. If you create seperate cookbooks, categories within cookbooks and recipes within categories, they are all alphabatized. I already have my recipes in the order I want them and I would like them to stay that way when I input them. If anynoe has a fix to this short of numbering everything, let me know.[...]"
2,If you have Vista - Don't bother.,"If you buy a NEW machine and it comes with Vista, DON'T buy this product. It may install on the new PC and even work with the HELP patch, but just try and get your own menus off of the old (under XP) PC on to the new box (with Vista). If you have spent hours and hours getting your recipes in to MC you will need to hang on to your old PC just to run MC. Not an pleasant option. If you have to re-enter all your recipes go find something else that is Vista compatible. BTW, requests to MC support only state that:""This title is not Vista compatible. The restore function is one of the features that Vista broke within Mastercook.""So if you have Vista don't bother with this product."
2,"OOPS, Godzilla needs another make-over.","A weak entry, in my opinion, so weak that I almost changed my mind on the American Godzilla (ok, not that bad). Very clunky FX and terrible story combined for a pathetic Godzilla movie. However; redemption can be found in ""Godzilla, Mothra & King Ghidora - Giant Monsters All-Out Attack"" an unfortunate title, but a superior movie to this one. Do yourself a favour and check that one out and skip this one."
5,must see for godzilla fans,I am a big godzilla fan have most them love the sci ti movies love all the diffevent monsters love
2,Godzilla - What happened?,"Man this Godzilla Sucks, it's not the fact that there are wires that you can see or the cheesy dialoge (to be expected) I just don't feel like this movie has any personality. NONE - I am one who loves the BIG green lizard. Bring back the old style when he was good sometimes bad oh well let's wait for the next one."
3,Fair,"Boa is a smooth moving scifi flick. It has good qualities like Dean Cain being in it and the CG is handled smoothly. But good actors and well-motioned CG isn't enough to earn this one a 4 or 5 because even though the CG is handled well, you can still tell it is computer generated, and some of the prisoner characters are just ridiculous. Overall this is a movie you might want to check out, but rent it before you buy it."
4,Not that bad (a LOT better than Python),"I don't know why many people did not like this film. Its true, the snake gets very little screen time and is kept in the shadows most of the time, but the plot and the sequence of the movie were very good in my opinion. At least the snake in this movie doesn't change in size like the one in python. I'm also aware that the film doesn't deserve 4 stars. In my opinion it deserves 3 but I do not think that the overall average rating of 2.5 stars is fair. The only of the many flaws that bugged me was the change of size of the snake's blade in the tail. It ranged from being as big as half a person to being as small as a kitchen knife. But for people who have seen this type of movies many times it should not be much of a problem to see this. Recommend this product for people who do not get bugged by some minor details."
2,CONSTRICTED THRILLER,"It's hard to believe while watching BOA That Dean Cain once played Superman. Here he is supergeek, pathetically underacting a role that wasn't even needed in the film. Ditto to Elizabeth Lackey's lackluster performance as his obsessed paleontological wife. Only Mark Sheppard as the Chechyan prisoner brings life into a role that should have been expanded. His heroics at the end put Dean Cain in his place quite properly.Now as for the snake, there were times it looked frighteningly real; other times it was quite obvious the movie's budget constricted its monster. Craig Wasson who was so good in ""Body Double"" and ""Ghost Story"" horribly overacts his role as the Warden. The finale is quite good, and unexpected compared to the movie itself.All in all, it's nowhere as awful as ""Tail Sting"", but it's not as good as it could have been under different guidance."
2,Disappointed,"It could have been better than Anaconda. BOA ( R ) a movie I picked up thinking it would have some Sci-Fi value. I was disappointed. The film takes place 12,000 feet below the earth's crust in the South Pole. A team of engineers are building the next Alcatraz to house the badest of the very bad. I guess the governments of 30 plus nations thought this is the best place to build it. The movie stars Dean Cain (TV's Superman) and he gets no help for an unknown supporting cast. Although I don't think a cast of Oscar winners could have kept this movie off the B list. Compare it to Alien, there is no comparison. If you're in the mood for a movie of big snakes, Anaconda with Jon Voight and Jennifer Lopez is a better choice. Or switch to big Crocks in Lake Placid staring Oliver Platt and enjoy a good laugh."
3,A review,"My son recieved two of these for christmas a few years ago. While it was nice for a little while, i found that at age 10 months, he had outgrown it. When we put it in our daughters crib, i found that over the course of a few hours, it is a little annoying and i honestly feel that the volume is too loud on this toy."
2,donesn't entertain my son for a long!,"My son loves muscic so I bought this for him, but he really doesn't use it that much. He'll only play with it for a short while."
3,not worth it,i bought the piano for my son when he was 5months old and it already shorted out. when the other animals are pressed the elephant sound goes off.he liked it but it wasnt worth 25 dollars
4,keeps going and going!,"I bought this for my son when he was six months old...I places it in his crib and he would fall asleep playing with it...you don't need to touch very hard for it to start working which is nice because a baby can't hit the thing very hard!!! The batteries last forever...I think I have changed them twice and he is two now...he doesn't play with it much now but it still works perfectly which says a lot for its durablity!!The toy has a few settings...one is music...one is a keyboard, another is a women's voice saying ""bear"" or ""cat"" or ""dog"" and then the sound the animal makes...the colors are bright and it's all enclosed with no sharp edges!!! A great toy for your little one!!"
1,You'll learn more watching porn,"Too many words, not enough pictures. I bought this for my wife and gave it to her on our honeymoon. It didnt do anything for us. I should have just brought my laptop and watched porn. The hotel had free wifi."
4,Peaked my curiousity. Good Read,"I have been curious about what this was all about for years. It's been one of those things that's been on the back of my mind for a while. I ended up buying this on a whim. I was actually really impressed by the whole thing.It wasn't all about sexual position and things like that. It had a lot of sound advice for living.As with a lot of old things, this didn't seem to hold all of its original value. I don't think I understood all of some of the lengthy passage but parts of it were absolutely fascinating.It was a fun thing to read after all I've heard about this kind of thing. I recommend checking it out."
3,Wasn't what I expected I guess.,"It would have been nice if it had pictures, its a lot smaller than I expected and its pretty cheap. It looks almost like a school paperback textbook, the ones that fall apart."
3,Wait till it's dirt cheap...,"This movie was O.K. but not that great. It was touted as a ""rambo on a dirtbike"" movie. I would be more willing to call it a rambo/dukes of hazzard on a dirtbike (with a LARGE touch of chick flick). As awesome as this sounds(minus the chick flickery), it really wasn't. It had a bit of dirtbike riding on vinage kawasaki's, and a bit of the main character outsmarting REALLY dumb local yocals. There are some cool scenes where he blows some stuff up. I would say if you can get it really cheap or catch it on the tube, it's worth watching. I would say it's not worth more than about 15 bucks... If it weren't so rare it would be in the $5 bin at Walmart lol."
4,Tale of Despereaux,"The Tale of Despereaux is a very original story, I thought it was very good. Readers of the Redwall series by Brian Jaques will enjoy this book. With a satisfying climax and conclusion, I rate this book 4 stars."
3,A warning to parents of younger children,"My 6-year-old son and I love the complexity of the plot and the mouse and rat characters. But I want to issue a word of warning to parents of younger children. The abandonment and beating of the 6-year-old girl is brutal, and my son was quite upset by it. I'm not saying we should shield our children from all that is bad in the world, but the descriptions are so vivid, and the girl's world so bleak, that I was stunned as I read it aloud. My son was near tears. He had never known that adults exist who treat children so brutally, and I'm not sure I wanted him to know that at the tender age of 6. I am a writer myself, and I strongly believe in reality in literature, but we will continue reading the book only if he is sure he wants us to. I suggest reading these parts yourself before deciding to read this to your child."
2,The Tale of Despereaux,"I was very excited to read this story. Kate DiCamillo is a talented author. Before I continue I want to point out that I am an adult and enjoy reading books for all ages. However, although this book is marketed for 9-12 year olds, I felt it should be for children much younger. The story begins well, but then the author addresses the reader throughout the book, often talking down to them as if they don't know anything. I found this not only distracting, but I thought it didn't give kids enough credit. Children are smart, they get it. I don't beleive they need to be hit over the head with points or asked to look up words in the dictionary while enjoying a good book. That said, I thought the story ended too easily. There was great build up and controversy as everything came to a head, but then the story just kind of petered out. A great build up needs a great ending. I was disappointed."
5,One amazing mouse!!,"I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a book with multiple plots, talking animals, and people to listen to these animals. This book is about a mouse named Despereaux who is a mouse moms worst nightmare. Despereaux has no instincts of a mouse and is absolutely fascinated by books, humans, and music. Despereaux is not smart and breaks the mouse rules of conduct. he is banished and you must find out why. Roscuro is an evil rat who always wants revenge. Light is also a character in this book. Darkness and love as well are characters. If you want to find out why there are such peculiar characters you must read this book because I can't tell you everything."
4,"The Tale of Despereaux: Being the Story of a Mouse, a Princess, Some Soup and a Spool of Thread",My 8 yr old son and I are reading it and we both really like it so far. We're about 1/2 way through.
3,some flaws but a good story,"I read this book aloud to my nephew (age 7) and he really enjoyed the story. We also learned some interesting vocabulary words (perfidy, chiaroscuro, etc.) and French words and phrases, and I must say that hearing a child actually use these words in a conversation does make him sound very intelligent. My biggest complaint is the way the reader is repeatedly addressed within the story (""But, reader...,"" ""Reader, do you know...?"") which gets very annoying and somewhat intrusive upon the story. If you read it aloud, I found it very useful to leave the word ""reader"" out or to use the child's name in it's place."
4,A great book for all ages,"This book is a great fairy tale. It would have been better if she didn't keep saying ""now reader before we go forward we have to go backward"" because half of the book was basically a big old cliff-hanger. Although the book was pretty good so I give it 4 stars."
5,Emotional,"This story is really good. I like that the mouse believes in his self and goes in the dungeon and saves the princess. Also I like when Miggry Sow believes that she can be a princess. Then, Rossco likes the light and tells the other rats in the dungeon."
5,The Tale of Despereaux,"I could not put down my kindle and I could just keep reading about the mouse,Miggery sow, the princess, and the rat. I want you Kate Dicamillo to write"" The Tale of Despereaux 2"". That's how much I liked this book even though it was very sad."
2,"Loved the mouse, not the story","Despereaux is an endearing character and the story starts out excitedly with his adventures. It goes downhill from there. There is little to endear all the other characters (besides Despereaux) in the book to anyone. They're all terribly stupid, cruel, lemmings, or simple. And there is no sympathy for anybody. I was not at all enchanted with the plotline, nor how their stories came together.I really wanted to love this book, I savored reading it and put it off for years looking forward to it. But after reading it, I was unfortunately disappointed in the tale. I would have to alternatively recommend highly, as another reader did, the REDWALL series, and POPPY. And STUART LITTLE or CHARLOTTE'S WEB."
5,WINDSURFING,"Excellent book for beginners and intermediate windsurfers. Lots of colorful pictures, Techniques explained in plain English. The author took his time to explain these in detail. Long and short boards, also more advanced techniques are discussed.If you are just getting started, this is a great book for you."
1,Boring,The movie was boring. I almost fell asleep while waiting for something to happen. The acting was awful. Don't waste your money.
3,Works when it works but...I think I broke it.,"When it works, it works very well. It's very handy for mixing one cup at a time of powdered drinks. It does a great job and then, it shortly quits working. I have owned a few of these. After use, I like to rinse it a few times and let it air-dry up-side-down as it sits on it's head. Of course, the water drains into the mechanism. I am probably destroying these things all by myself which is why I split the rating and gave it an ""ok"". I think it's time to move on to something that can handle my way of doing things."
1,Not enough power to mix,"This little mixer is a great idea, but it does not function properly in mixing protein shakes. I use Herbalife shake powders and thought this would be an easy mixer to keep handy in my bag while on the go. But it does not have enough power to mix the shakes and the water together. This would be a good item for use with kids drinks or maybe making a salad dressing---but nothing thick, such as the powdered protein drinks."
2,Fine . . . Until . . .,"A little gem. I used it daily to mix powdered diet drinks UNTIL . . . one day it just stopped working. I guess I got about six months use out of it. It was a handy product while it lasted, and I didn't expect it to last forever, so I don't feel terribly gypped. But I've gone back to my full-sized blender because I know it will last."
4,Works well for mixing protein powder into milk.,"Purchased directly from Amazon. Based on other reviewers, I went with the Fit & Fresh mixer instead of other options, and so far it seems like a decent product.The good things about it are that it does a good job of mixing my protein powder without clumps, has an extra wand, and has a travel pouch if you want to take it with you to work or wherever. It's also battery-powered and easy to clean/remove the wand.The things that make it minus one star rating are: It has very weak power, and seems cheaply made. However, I've been using it every morning for two weeks and it works well for mixing 1/4 cup of isolated soy protein powder in a glass of milk. I think it would struggle under any heavier loads (like ice or thick yogurts). Hope that helps."
2,Just not powerful enough,"I absolutely love fruity protein drinks and truly enjoy them during the day while at work. I've tried many different self contained mixing/drinking containers but none of them worked well enough. So, I found this nice little mixer that came in it's own case and was compact enough to throw in my backpack or pocket. Most of the reviews said it was powerful enough to mix protein shakes and the price was right so I bought it. Well, it's not nearly powerful enough for protein shakes. It will 'sort of' mix them but you still get the unmixed 'globs' when you drink it. I'll still bring it on camping trips and road trips but unfortunately in this case, you do get what you pay for."
3,"Decent hat, but too SMALL","I adjusted this hat to its largest size, and it was still too small to fit my head. So, while I would recommend this hat for those with small to medium size heads, anyone with a large-ish hat size should definitely look elsewhere."
4,Nas verse on Hot Boyz is pretty Fire,This was a single featuring Eve and of course the legends Nas and Q-Tip were also on this hugely popular rap single number one for 18 weeks I believe on the defunct rap singles chart.There is an all right verse by Missy and Eve a good verse by Q-Tip and expecially a great verse by Nasir Jones him selfLyrics 9/10 Production 7/10 Overall 8/10
5,Awesome superior sequel,"I love this movie. It's one of those rare occasions when you mix several different types of genres, mix a bunch of different characters, and it completely works as a formula perfectly. In this case you mix aztec with the old west with the pre-historic with modern day. Somehow they pull it off brilliantly. Each character fits. The house looks great, the electrician was a fantastic comedy relief spot, and the action/adventure elements are truly entertaining. It tells a great story and this House movie far out-trumps the original. It's a rare case of a sequel being much better than its predecessor. Entertaining from beginning to end, and a great trip back to an era of great moviemaking. Enjoy!"
4,"An attractive photo essay on brick in Cambridge, Mass.","Cambridge, Massachusetts is full of brick. Brickyards were a major industry in the claypits of West Cambridge. Many of our sidewalks are made of brick. Many substantial 19th century buildings were brick, especially institutions and apartment buildings -- but only a few row houses (most residential building is in wood).This book is a modest photo essay, very attractive, picking out interesting brick details from buildings and sidewalks. Don't expect more than that -- it's not a systematic survey or comparative analysis or great photography. But it's certainly attractive and attentive to... detail."
3,Maybe Get a Frisbee or a Ball Instead?,"Proudly made in the USA (likely for only a few pennies,) this throwable thing will provide several quality moments of fun. Then you'll probably come to the conclusion that you could be having more fun with a flying disc/Frisbee or a ball of some sort.Even with a good wind this thing doesn't come close to flying the 150 feet mentioned on its packaging. I'm bringing it to the beach in a few weeks and expect it to entertain others about as long as it's entertained me. Then I'll bring out the other tossable items ;)Got some money to burn? Grab one and add it to your arsenal.Not feeling so fat in the wallet? Pass on this one."
2,Not that well made,The circular plastic/paper band that maintains its shape breaks all too easily. Still works passably but not like the video demonstrations.
3,"40,000 horsemen","As an historical record of this very important film from 1941, it is worth having, but I think it should be mentioned that this is not re-mastered at all, but a straight copy of an old print of the film, scratchy sound & all. I was disappointed to find that it was a burned disc, not a commercially produced one.Still, I am glad I have it."
2,"Initial quality was poor, and the remainder of the film was mediocre from the noise point of view.","I accept that the film is now very old however the first few minutes both sound and visual were poor. Naturally it is many, many years since I saw the movie in a picture theatre,and I must admit I expected that it was more of a factual reproduction of the light horse in action. The love story that dominated most of the viewing time was a bore.On the credit side the typical ""ozzie"" digger was very well done, and gave me considerable pleasure as my Father was in the10th Light Horse and from the few humouress stories I could get out of him, the actors chosen upheld all of the traditions of my Father and his fellow Light Horsemen."
4,Fine book,"A really enjoyable book. It has colour as well as black and white illustrations, which is always a plus. The writing isn't the best, but not so bad as to be off-putting. A good buy."
1,useless book,I bought this book for about $13 though not from Amazon.The questions in this book are not like the questions on the SAT at all. Example - 709-635=xWhat is x?You will never see a question like that on the SAT. Absolute waste of money. Even the model tests do not resemble the SAT in any way.
3,Like watching a trainwreck,"Somewhat fascinating at times embarrasing at others, this collection of backstage footage of Al Jourgensen and the rest of Ministry anno 1996 being drunk and high, peppered with commentary from everything from people who toured with the band five years earlier to people who say they've never even met Jourgensen was a bit disappointing to me. To watch Jourgensen shoot up and/ or get drunk and make an uncharismatic moron of himself isn't all that interesting. I would much rather have seen a proper documentary about the golden days of Ministry 1988-1996 preferably with interviews with people actually involved with the band at the time such as Paul Barker, Chris Connelly, Willian Rieflin Mike Scaccia etc.I'll give this 2 disc collector's edition one additional star for the included cd by Paul Barker which is surprisingly good. The songs sounds more like Ministry than Ministry and features both Chris Connelly and Nivek Ogre on vocals among others."
1,NPS means NO POWER SYSTEM!!!,"I ordered this and had it direct-shipped it as a gift to my grandchildren in another state. I had no idea that it was just a bare airframe with no motor or radio control system. In other words it is worthless to them as is, and if we were to keep it there is an unknown amount of additional expense and assembly required to make it fly."
3,slow,"This music is ok, but it's kind of slow and boring. It's also kind of New Age sounding and I didn't like that."
2,So-So,"This book didn't really have what I was looking for in terms of content. I also strongly disagreed with the author's premise that sexual relationships were not that serious. The only take away point that I gained from this book was that conflicts should be addressed with the person one is in conflict with, not with a third party."
5,"Superb Quality, Sound and Harmony","I have purchased 10 copies of this DVD to gift to friends who like Frankie, but also appreciate great musicianship. Frankie is at or near the top of his game in this performance, and the supporting musicians/singers are flawless. Lead guitarist Larry Lingle does most of the high harmonies, along with the drummer, and the orchestra is lead masterfully by Robbie Robinson, who continues to be Frankies' musical director to this day. Remember that this is ""live"". The harmonies are on the money. I play the DVD through a BluRay 7.1 system which seems to ""upconvert"" it, such that the sounds are amazing. I don't pretend to be an audiophile, but this is a real quality piece. Might be my favorite!"
5,Fantastic Friankie in Concert,Prompt delivery in excellent condition. The quality of the DVD and its contents is fantastic!!
4,Classic Rock 'N' Roll Magic,"I really enjoyed this dvd. The concert, filmed in the early 1990's took place in a relatively small venue, and had a casual intimate atmosphere. Frankie Valli sounded great. Though he was a little reserved at times, his performance, for the most part, was very strong and reminiscent of the early rock 'n' roll/doo wop sound. His interpretations of ballads like ""Silence is Golden"", and ""My Eyes Adored You"" come across as more tender and sensitive than the studio versions. In addition to hits like ""Grease"", ""Dawn"", and ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" there are also some little known treasures included like, ""Silver Star"", and ""Fallen Angel"". Although the Four Seasons are replacements for the originals, they do an exceptionally good job, especially the very talented and charismatic singer and keyboardist, Tim Stone. If you're a fan of Frankie Valli this would be an excellent addition to your collection.Jennifer K. LaffertyAuthor of Offbeat Love Stories and More"
2,"good Four seasons, bad Valli","This backing band called Four Seasons is really great but Valli is bored to death playing in front of 70 tables with old people (maybe only 70 tables). No voice power. The doo-wap part is amazing and you forget Valli there. Valli is not the important part of this show. If you really want to see the Four seasons go and see the play. It is a soul lifting production with great energy, at least in London. Back to this dvd, great music, poor lead singing, great backing band. Well, he's been singing the same old stuff for 30 years, right?"
2,Only good for drivers,"We returned this very thin volume almost immediately. It is essentially a road atlas for Egypt, and doesn't give any other information at all. If we'd been planning to drive out in the desert, this would have been great to have. We weren't."
5,Great Book!,"I absolutely loved this book. From the moment I started reading it, I did not want to put it down. Anyone can benefit from reading this book."
2,broke immediately,my housekeeper got this in the mail last week while I was away. he broke it immediately and complained about how it screwed together .. lack of strength or something. he went out and bought something similar for $18 that he likes.
2,Did not last very long!,"After eight uses it came apart,not able to use.I was very disappointed.I would not buy again.I would not recommend it."
3,"Great Subject Matter, Writing Dragged","The Peabody sisters are a very interesting part of our county and women's history. I seem to be in the minority, but I felt that the writing dragged their story down. I am spoiled by the brilliant writing of Doris Kearns Goodwin. When you read her biographies you are immersed in her subjects. I got through this book in a month, as I wanted to know more about these fascinating women. If the sisters weren't so intriguing, I probably would have quit this book earlier."
3,A Mixed Bag!,"I picked up a copy of Gaelforce Dance at my local Half Price Books and paid less than $10.00 for it. I'm glad I didn't spend very much on it.I thought I would see something similiar to Riverdance that would be about Irish mythology. This show, while it was good, wasn't haunting and magickal as Riverdance is.The storyline was strikingly unoriginal and was therefore easy to follow. However, some of the numbers didn't seem to have anything to do with the story itself. And why they had a Riverdance-type finale at the end...It didn't seem to belong at all.Basically, this show was a ballet, and as a general rule, when a ballet is over is over, it's over. They don't usually do a finale-type last number.The music was good, but the singer was hard to understand and wasn't very good. However the dancers were very good.So I rate the other parts of the show at 2 and the dancing at 5, which it gets a 3 altogether."
3,Great toy but small,This is a great add on to pump set a action factory (monrail sold seprtley)But i got the big kit because there is not much to do beside drive around on this one. But if you want something cheap you can change it around.
2,terrible,Mos def disappointed me on this cd the only good song on it is LOVE OF MY LIFE by erica badu and commonsave your money
5,"Excellent soundtrack, EXCELLENT MOVIE!!","This CD has not left my player since it came out. The songs flow well together.. just think: here you have a mix of Mos, Erykah, Jill, Rashaan,(just to name a few) and then there are extra treats like Cassandra Wilson's beautiful rendition of ""Time after Time"" or Eric B. and Rakim. I highly recommend both the movie and this soundtrack. It has been awhile and we should all go out and support this music and this movie so we can see more like these being made. I was originally attracted to Erykah and Common's joint ""love of my life"" cause that song is awesome enough by itself to get the album. But ""Brown Sugar(fine)"" by Most Def, Mary J. Blige's sexy song & ""Easy Conversation"" by Jill Scott have easily caused me to press the repeat button many times. If you havent yet, see the movie and you will only appreciate the songs on the soundtrack more"
5,In Love with Original Hip Hop,This is a great collection from all the current hip-hop and r&b artists who appreciate classic r&b and hip hop roots. It shows in the music they made. All of the tracks on the CD are great. it is usually a crap shoot when it comes to soundtracks but this one is fab!
3,Song Title?,What is the name of the song by Common playing when Diggs is talking to Lathan on the radio at the end of the film? She's in the booth and he's looking through the window.
1,This book advocates beating your children in the name of God,"This book was given to me as a gift. I started reading it with an open mind but was quickly appalled at what I read. Here are direct quotes from the book and I'll let you decide for yourself.""...mild slaps on the bottom or the hand can begin between fifteen and eighteen months of age.""""If it doesn't hurt, it doesn't motivate a child to avoid the consequences next time. A slap with the hand on the diapered bottom of a two-year-old is not a deterrent to anything.""""I would suggest that the youngster be placed in bed and given a little speech... Then when his feet touch the floor, give him one swat on the legs or backside with a small paddle or belt. Put the paddle on the dresser where the child can see it, and promise him one more stroke if he gets up again.""Instead of this book, I highly recommend The Discipline Book by Dr. William Sears."
4,easy reading,"i found it much easier to get through the book, just listening, espicially with my one year old."
1,spanking? are you stuck in the 50s?,hard to believe in this day and age that anyone would advocate spanking as a valid form of discipline. smacking your kid around doesn't strike me as very christain either. this book is going in the trash because I don't want an unsuspecting parent to pick it up at goodwill and then implement this sadist's suggestions. there are many and much healthier ways to deal with a wild child. i was one and now I have one so I've been on both sides of the argument.
1,Never received the book,I ordered this book exactly one month ago yesterday and have never received it. I've emailed the store twice with no response. Guess I just threw my money out the window.
3,Dobson review,"Mostly anecdotal, cases by cases as basis for interventions and behavioral strategies. Nice to have info through the early life through teen years to compare differences in kids and age appropriate strategies."
3,Good Action Lousy Copy,"I appreciate classic SciFi and Fantasy films being restored and put on DVD, but I don't appreciate it when they are not restored and quickly slapped on DVD. This looked like somebody set up a projector and copied it off a screen. They wonder why people buy pirated copies. The movie itself makes some interesting points and shows video teleconferencing long before it became fact. The actual rollerball sequences make the movie since it gets a bit slow when they are not at the track. Unless you are an avid fan you may want to hold off on purchasing it until someone makes a better copy."
4,Great movie.,"If you've seen the remake of Rollerball, you have not seen Rollerball. Packed with social issues, action and James Caan--this movie has a lot going for it.The only reason for giving the dvd a 4 is:1. no commentary--damn.2. the sound quality not so hot but it is coming from an older movie."
1,rollerball with james caan,"I ordered this movie about 6 weeks ago and still have not recieved product..,can't get any info on its where-abouts through amazon ,and where's my stuff..i am getting a little angry"
3,Good... but not as good as hyped up to be,"It seems like everyone is declaring this the return of rock and the greatest album of all time. It's really not. It sort of sounds like a tribute to the 60s, and although it is better done then the other retro bands out today, its still not perfect. Dont get me wrong, this is a good album and i enjoy listening to it. The songs just get a little repetitive. My fav songs are probably Tonight and Independent Luxary. This is an album worth buying, but not worth the hype it's recieving."
2,Overrated,This album is way overrated. They sound like an uninspired Rolling Stones/Pink Floyd cover band. The singer is a joke as well. He walks around in all these robes. It appears as if he can't decide whether to play Dungeons and Dragons or front a rock band.
2,Give them an A for effort.,"This album starts out with a bang but falls off quickly. The first two songs almost manage to hold their own, despite unassuming lyrics almost purposely designed to be about nothing or anything. (Think Gavin Rosdale and Bush.) After that, well, things only get worse. I bought this album after seeing the band perform Sister Surround on the Late Show and was thoroughly disappointed with the rest of the cd. After several listens I'm left with the sense that this is a young group of guys who are either trying way too hard to be profound, or have reached the limit of a very limited range of talent. Don't buy this without giving it a FULL listen first. Or go ahead and buy The Stone Roses' ""Second Coming"" instead."
4,Great product!,This product is great for those construction workers that are hard on their tools and their gear. It holds up great and still looks great as it wears! The last one lasted seven years!
5,My very favorite show!!,"I am so happy to have the full Felicity collection on DVD. This set is perfect! It's so nice to revisit Felicity, Ben, and Noel at my leisure. No complaints!!"
4,"Voice good, mask ridiculous","Of course we listen to opera for the great singing, and Joan Sutherland has that, but the ""masked ball"" glasses she wore for most of the first act were really distracting. She looked like a cartoon character.Plus she's an incredibly huge person, and that thing she had on her head, something between a headress and a hat, I'm not even sure what to call it, made me go stand in the kitchen and just listen instead of watch.Give me Anna Netrebko or Renee Fleming, who at least look like an ingenue, if you're going to produce made-for-the-screen operas. When you get that fat, you need to stay in the studio.I was disappointed I could't add this CD to my itunes library. It only plays on the DVD player."
2,Nature photography or digital manipulation?,"This is a decent book if you are new to the world of macro photography. It certainly doesn't cover in-depth aspects of shooting macro and even devotes a large portion of digitally manipulating images on Adobe Photoshop. For example, the cover is composed of two separate images, the flower and the frog. There's a place for digital manipulation, but I felt disappointed after finding out that some otherwise beautiful images (that would have been spectacular to capture in the wild) were faked. I had higher expectations coming from the Sierra Club."
5,Sehr gut,Very well done film about one of the best loved and well know Austrian marches and its composer. Beautiful scenery of the austrian county side and wonderful reenactment of the noble time of the Kaisers.
2,ok product,"These are ok if your dough isn't very solid. The metal is very thin and bends easily. Still, try and find a biscuit cutter anywhere else."
3,What a sad little plant,"It arrived well packaged and intact but the plant above the soil line is only about 10"" tall and with a very few leaves. Little new growth. Nothing like the luscious pictures used to sell it. I'll give it some TLC but if it doesn't meet the expectations I was given, it's off to the bonsai table."
4,Torments the Dog but Soothes the Baby,This is a really fun little toy that my 5 month old loves to hold to his chest... so far it torments the dog more than anything... so still worth the money!
4,"A great deal, very nice product","Search for different sellers of this product. The first pair I bought - the postage cost more than the item! I searched a bit and found a seller that didn't charge S&H!! I bought 2 pair for less than the price of the first! Also, they are cheaper than what I can buy in a local shop here. These aren't tough as iron and the don't have the sheen and smoothness of a 'real' pair of name brand hose, but they fit well and look great with a garter belt, which is what is needed. Try them! I hope you have a good experience with this product."
3,It's OK,"Not high quality. You can probably use it about 3-4 times.In fact, the package arrived and already have a snag. I sent it back."
2,soft but ok,"I do not like the way these lasted for one day. They will stay up with a garter and feel extra silky.Sheer Thigh Hi Stockings - Available in One Size, Plus Size, and Colors -By Leg Avenue"
2,Expect not too much,"You know the hit ""Doop"" by Doop? OK, it is also on this CD, but that is the only highlight. There are many dumb tracks on this CD, all sounds somehow equal. You listen to it one time, but then it is boring."
5,Excellent but with one reservation,"I bought this to show to my 5th grade class as I delve into the study of reptiles throughout the year. However, I had to stop the video when it got to the graphic activity of procreation. As a public school teacher, I cannot show this. It always is an issue for me as I am unable to show so many wonderful and educational videos due to this very issue. Why does every nature animal video need to show the animals procreating? You've excluded a big audience. Other than that, the video was wonderful. Sadly, I was the only one able to see it and was never able to show it to any of my classes."
3,Bolle Sport Serpent,"Bolle: they make great lenses, and so-so frames. These are the second pair of bolle's i've owned. Primary use: cycling - lenses tend to fog up if sitting still. Unfortunately these glasses are ""girly"" glasses, and as my co-workers stated when i took them out of the box, ""nice lady ga-ga glasses!"" The frames are probably better suited for someone with a more pronounced bridge than what my asian face supplies, as the bottom of the frames rest on my lower eye sockets. Cost for glasses = ~ $60. Worth it? Probably not."
4,Oh yes,Am happy with my purchase. thanks.Sony & Cher were the singers of my youth. Good songs & CD. Thanks so much for the great service. God bless.
4,I Got You Babe,I was very pleased with this cd. Brought back a lot of good memories. Sure do miss Sonny & Cher Saw them in person a few times at their concerts & they were just great.
5,Verdi - Un Ballo in Maschera,"Oscar, Reri Grist, was amazing. Her performance of Oscar was simply outstanding and a gem to watch. She is physically able to endure the jumping and singing simultaneously which is difficult and was exceptionally successful at it. Great actress with great voice as well. I wish I had a recording of her singing ""Voices of Spring"". Acting and singing extremely good for the entire cast and Placido Domingo? What can I say except just great. I've never seen or heard him in anything that was not exceptional. I enjoyed the other beautiful voices especially the ""bad guys"" plotting to kill the king.Great production and highly recommend purchasing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"A great book, still very relevant","This author seems to know everything, every little detail and background. All those confusing security terminologies are well explained."
2,Poor for visual learners,"I am a visual learner (I would rather review a colleague's email on line than over the telephone), and this method is not meant for me! (Nor am I interested in learning to say something the way a woman would, since I am a man.)If you're an auditory learner, fine. If you're not, this will be a double challenge--new language and less helpful learning style."
2,Not much more than a teaser for Book 3,"I haven't been able to read the first book in this series by Harbaugh, though I've read summaries and, of course, there are clues in this book as to what happened, so I don't feel too lost. With Cupid's Darts, though, I have to say that I agree with some of the other reviewers here. Kenneth and Aimee - and the anti-hero, Francis - held little interest for me. It was Psyche and Harry who provided all the humour and interest, and I really felt as if I was just skimming this book in order to allow me to get on to Psyche's story.This is disappointing, because I usually rate Harbaugh's books much more highly. I do feel that I'll be rating the final book in the trilogy higher, though!"
5,Unforgettable,"Good characters, interesting plot..I hope she writes a sequel..cupid as one of the characters is very ingenious, hilarious - a keeper!"
1,"Good performance, but ridiculous costumes","The singers are great, especially Bruce Ford and Ann Murray. Unfortunaly, the director has made bad choices regarding the sets ... and the costumes. They are so exaggerately wide that the characters seem to be sitting on the border of their bed! And what about the make-up? All characters have white faces. You could believe they are dead. All this deconcentrates the viewer. I was so frustrated that I stopped looking at it and did something else while listening. I would recommend to buy the CD version with Cecilia Bartoli instead. If you buy this one, listen to it, but turn your TV off!"
3,Healing Mantras by Thomas Ashley-Farrand,"Thomas Ashley-Farrand is a scholar, and his approach to explaining matras is scholarly. That does not mean he is detached. He has developed a deep interest and seems to believe in their efficacy. His writings and demonstration CD's are not meant for beginners in Hindu practice nor for those who have only a passing interest in Hindu ritual. For those, he perhaps explains too much in too much detail. However, for the serious student of Hinduism, you could not find a more expert study."
3,Competent Work - But Not Inspired,"The healthcare field faces its latest crisis: staffing shortages resulting in upward pressure on compensation and quality of work life issues. HR is targeted for its inability to rise to the occasion and ""get the bodies in here."" Hiring standards and staffing ratios are pressured.Studer tells us what we need to do to resolve these immediate concerns, with a demonstrable track record of success. But even the name of the most innovative and clear thinker in health care is absent from this book.The book will migrate through the ""need to know"" dimensions of health care HR practice - its sponsorship by the American Hospital Association assures that. But competency stops way short of inspiration. In an industry in crying need for transformational leadership, don't esxpect it from the AHA."
2,NOT a size 3 futsal ball,"What I received was an official ""adult"" size futsal ball even though the online description and invoice specified size 3. This ball will not work for my U-10 team and I'll have to place another order to get the size I need. Very frustrating. The ball itself looks like a nice ball for an older child or adult."
1,ealges,Very poor sound quality. Would have mailed back but then would have wasted more money! Very disappointed.
3,Sh-Boom?!?!?,"I was looking for the chords version of Sh-boomInstead I got this disc. Not bad if you're juststarting to collect doo wops. But, for the averagecollectors - we already have all these.Disappointment! Disappointment! Disappointment!"
3,Very outdated,This book is very outdated as far as pictures but the text is okay and it provides useful information. I was going to return it but realized that the seller charged 1 cent for the book and 3.99 for shipping so I might as well keep it. I purchased this item to read to a kindergarten class but it does not seem appropriate for that type of reading.
5,"Great for pediatric patients, too!","I bought this book for my 5 year old daughter. It is informative, sensitive and non threatening. She really got the message, too! She admonished me for cleaning ear wax from her ear w/o aksing permission first~ ""because its MY body!"" I am a pediatric nurse and now recommend this book to parents who want a resouce to teach their kids this extremely important message of protecting their body and feeling empowered to do so."
2,Spanking has nothing to do with sexual abuse,"As a social worker I get so weary of hearing about the evils of spanking. This book claims that by spanking a child you we touching their genitals and leading to sexual abuse. That's outrageous. Whether you agree with spanking or not there's a huge difference between a calm, rational adult using spanking as a means of discipline, and an out of control adult hitting as a means of coercion and control. Her understanding of the Old Testament is also incomprehensible. Spanking and sexual abuse are two completely separate issues and should not be confused."
1,Dont be fooled,by the pic this item isnt as cute as it looks. you can hardly notice the itty bitty jewels when you get it home. The display picture must have really enlarged.
2,"Interesting, but only worth $4.00.","Okay I'm in a Black Greek sorority so I was interested due to the fact that it was stepping from the women's perspective. First of all this is no where near the quality of Stomp The Yard. The acting is bit horrendous and the sets looked straight from your local high school play. I understand it was a low budget film, but come on man. I really wish a large film company was invest money in another GOOD Black Greek film, but what can you do. Overall just wait until they air this on BET Starz or grab it as a quick rental at Blockbuster."
2,Where was Carlotta?,"I adore Carlotta. She's a character with lots of depth and personality. She has friends that I look forward to seeing. I don't understand what happened in The Big Dig. I couldn't find my friend Carlotta. I saw Roz briefly, but not the Roz I was expecting. Mooney? Gloria? Poulina? All missing. I'm going to pretend I never read The Big Dig. It isn't a typical Linda Barnes book. It was good, but it wasn't WONDERFUL like Linda's usual work. I want all my deep, richly drawn characters back! I know they are there in Linda's pen."
4,There is life after Mahogany Rush!,"Great 2nd solo effort from Canadian's Frank Marino & Co. Every so often I'll hear one of his songs from this album like ""Juggernaut"" or ""Strange Dreams"" on an obscure radio station..... it will bring me quickly back to 1982-83 and seeing him shred on stage at the Nassau Coliseum out on Long Island. It is truly sad that this axe-man never really got top billing or rec'd much commerical success. His guitar licks are truly music to the ears. Marino's first solo, ""The Power Of Rock & Roll"" is a close 2nd to ""Juggernaut"", but I still like this one best... possibly for the magical and celestial feel I get from ""Strange Dreams"". Other good songs are ""Midnight Highway"" and ""Maybe It's Time"". No crazy metal or lite pop here - just your basic blue collar hard rocking tunage. Somehow reminiscent of some old Pat Travers albums I have. Nice to see Marino's early and hard to find stuff coming out onto CD (as imports) in 2000-2001. It's about time."
2,love the song - hate the mixes,"These remixes are brutal. They are useless, the vocals have all been stripped from the mixes (except for the ""Club Mix"" and ""Radio Mix""), and the only mix that has vocals (""Trance Vox""), only starts out with the a cappella, and then loses any vocals when the beat comes in. Club-friendly mixes these ain't. Stick to the original version."
3,too loose for me,"""remnants"" is a great song,but this ep seems too jumbled together for my liking.i think if they took the time to release ""remnants"" to radio and master a whole album, then theyll have something to work with.this cd is cheap, but if organization is your thing, dont look here."
3,Echoes of the Dance is Alright,"Having read several of Marcia Willett's novels, I felt that this one, while it was alright, and enjoyable enough, I guess, didn't quite become a page-turner for me."
4,A good addition,"I enjoyed this Anime collection very much. You can find other reviews that will tell you all you could want to know about the story and content. So in summation it was amusing and enjoyable.Buy it used. One story that ties togather a few loose ends from the two series, My Z-Hime and My Hime, is not worth full price in my opinion."
5,A Redemptive Journey,"This book weaves together the author's journey working with people with Alzheimer's disease, and her journey of resolution with her long-deceased mother, who had dementia in her final years. It is a personal memoir, tender, funny, surprising, and redemptive."
5,Trapped,"Lynn's experiences were meaningful because they mimicked the relationship that I had with my mother and others that I visited at the nursing facility where mom was a resident for a number of years. Lynn is a remarkable individual. Working with Alzheimer patients requires a lot of compassion. Some of Lynn's experiences led me to tears and others had me laughing out loud. Her patients were lucky to have her because she understood that inside those trapped bodies were living spirits that needed love, attention, and a voice to communicate their needs. One of Lynn's most powerful passages comes when she speaks about their ""human responses to misguided abuses of their personal power.""Also the references and data points should proved to be helpful, particularly for new caregivers of Alzheimer patients."
4,Great variety,Collection has all my daughter's favorite characters from the movie. Likenesses of the characters is excellent. Would have given 5 stars except King Triton's character does not stand up. It was poorly designed and always has to be laid on its side--not a good depiction of his character.
5,Could cook for an Army with this pan... VERY NICE AND BIG. I LOVE IT.. MY DREAM CAST IRON PAN,I WILL COOK MANY THINGS AT ONE TIME IN THIS PAN.. WUT A PAN THIS IS !!! IF YOU BEEN DREAMING OF A BIG CAST IRON PAN THIS IS YOUR FULLFILLMENT.. GET YOU ONE !!!
5,Useful,"This is packed with information. It includes phone numbers, addresses, bus routes, and even websites. There are suggested tours based on how many days you have in a city, with tips on hotels, sightseeing, restaurants, night life, and shopping. It's too big to carry around in your pocket or purse, but it's worth packing (and studying beforehand)."
2,bad silence of the lambs,"i bought this dvd just because it had madchen amick and christ mulkey in it. they were both great in twin peaks. this movie is just a bad imitation of every detective movie made, plus silence of the lambs. madchen acts, dresses and sounds like dana scully from the x-files. yes, there are some twists and turns, but nothing more than trying to be clever. the movie is low on action, most of the ""drama"" is in the court room which the scene is drawn out. the dvd is presented in full screen, with no commentary or bonus materials. if your a fan of these actors, you'll probably watch it once or twice at most, and then forget about it in your pile of dvds."
1,ELEMENT Broken,This mic had an odd hole on the front skirt. It was definitly used and appeared to have been modified. It did NOT work. Appears teh mic element itself was broken. Beware of seller was evedenty UNTESTED
2,Well written book on John Miller,"Helen Airy wrote a convincing book for John Miller's case, but at times, even she seemed unsure of the accuracy of what she was writing. She documents the stories and beliefs of Miller's friends and family who believed he was Billy the Kid. The problem with the book is that most of it has been proven to be pure fiction. But, I do have to confess, it is fun reading."
4,"fun, but hard to know what to make of it","This is a short (about 120 pp) book of revisionist history, privately published by an old lady in New Mexico. Her thesis is that the outlaw Billy the Kidd did not die at the hand of Pat Garrett, but instead skipped town and started a new life as a farm worker in Buckeye, Arizona, calling himself John Miller.Airy's thesis is intriguing, but her evidence is slim and what there is is circumstantial at best. It's hard to get this out of your mind as you're reading it."
1,Made in China,Come on people! Stop falling for low price marketing when the actual price for this instrument should be $200 bucks. Please look at Selmer / Yamaha / Yanagiawa / Keilwerth / Vito for quality.

2,Battery Hog,"I have long been a fan of SI-5 and have owned flat panel speakers from each generation. Others would disagree with me, but the first generation is still the best.These Gen3 speakers are extremely portable, have a good sound, better range than one should expect, and an improved power system over previous generations. Within that power system lie the problems that lower my rating of this product - it is sometimes extremely difficult to open the battery cover (hardly a blip on my review if that were the only problem) and this is something that comes up more often than it should because these speakers are battery hogs. Even without the bass turned on and, it seems, even without the speakers turned on at all, the batteries drain. On multiple occasions I've watched a film on my computer one night with new batteries in the speakers and no troubles. The next night, the quality of sound immediately dips with whatever I start watching, after only 2 hours of prior use."
2,Strange Defect,"I got this for my 3-year-old laptop thinking that I could save $30 compared to the original Toshiba brand battery ... well, it was a mistake. The battery has a defect that I've never seen in any other battery of any type: it holds charge just fine (the computer will run for 2 hours with Wi-Fi and everything going), but it takes about a week (no exaggeration) to fully charge from empty to full. As you can imagine, this kind of defeats the purpose of having a battery at all; really, you can only use the batter in emergencies when you have no access to a power outlet, and even then, no more than once a week."
4,enchanting and otherworldly,"This is an atmospheric, mood-setting, visually indulgent take on the original tale; it remains satisfyingly true to the spirit of the fairy tale genre with its themes of enchantment and good vs. evil - this time interestingly set against a Scandinavian cultural backdrop. The sweet, captivating music further adds to this movie's strong mood-setting effect. It does an artful job of indulging the escapist's desire for fairy tale fantasy."
4,Fun telling of the tale,"For a Hallmark movie, this is typical fare, but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. Kristin Kreuk makes a good Snow White, and if you like the fairytale, you should enjoy this movie. Decent acting, nice special effects, overall the writing was fine though a few parts were slow or boring. 4/5 stars."
4,Interesting take...,"I found this enjoyable as a movie, but there were times when it seemed rather...flat. Some don't like it because it doesn't follow in the steps of the original animated version by Disney, but even THAT didn't follow the original fairy tale. In the original, there were no dwarves, but I like the dwarves of this one better than the animated one, especially with the way they incorporated the days of the week and the colors of the rainbow. The special effects were excellent.... Elspeth was a bit too vindictive and nasty for my tastes, but, hey, you can't win 'em all."
1,Snow who?,"Is this really a story about the famous Snow White? Who ever made this should never make another movie again! The story is horrible, it does not follow the storyline from the original Snow White. The acting is even worse, Snow white has the same expression on her face throughout the whole film, the prince is a whimp and the dwarves?! Oh my god, the days of the week?Miranda Richardson was the only good thing about this movie. She completely stole the stage from the pittiful Snow White. This joke does not even deserve one star."
5,The pop rock album of the 90's!,"Unlike most pop rock of this decade, this album/cd stands as a collection of singles, but more importantly, its themes of depression and loves lost make it a rarity among many pop rock bands and albums of this decade as it stands as an outstanding theme album as well. The tunes are often mournful without being depressing and the sound is rife with jangly guitars and soaring melodies, catchy pop phrasing and clever, meaningful, though often angst ridden pop lyrics. THe followup to this album, while good, was not as good as this one. A must have record for any pop rock fans and a refreshing alternative to the melody challenged grunge sound of the 90's. BUy it and you will never tire of it. EVery song hit home except the last one called cheating."
5,Unbeliveable,"If you haven't yet purchased this album, do yourself a favor and buy it ASAP. Any fan of country, bluegrass, celtic, or folk music will fall in love with Nickel Creek the first time you listen to this CD. The members of Nickel Creek are three of the most talanted young musicians to come around in a long time in, any genre (thanks to Allison Krause). The blend of classic and modern bluegrass with celtic and modern folk styles is absolutely captivating. In this day of ""young talent"" like nsync and britney spears, Nickel Creek's youthfully mature music is truly refreshing."
5,Touched my heart,"I have enjoyed the pureness of Allison Krauss' voice for years. While listening to CMT, I heard Nickel Creek, and, not knowing who they were, assumed it was Ms. Krauss. When I saw this new group, it instantly stirred something within my heart. My fiance surprised me with the CD, and now it is all I listen to! Sara's voice is so real, true and pure...the harmnoies are so soothing and melodic, and the instrumentals are beautiful. You have to listen to this CD, I promise it will touch your heart and soul!"
5,"Thank you, Alison !","As a huge fan of Alison Krauss, I was anxious to hear this CD and I was most pleased, although Sara Watkins sounds more like Alison Krauss than Alison Krauss does. The harmonies are awesome: ""Out Of The Woods"" makes me cry. Buy this CD if you like Union Station. Incredible talent for such young musicians. My wife says she hears a little of ""October Project"" present."
5,Awesome!,"These kids rule! I loved every song on this CD. Not only are they talented, they give anyone who listens to this CD a wonderful gift. This music brings a smile to my face every time I listen. This is money well spent. I can't wait for more!"
1,nickel creek,"Tho' very talented young musicians, to place Nickel Creekin the same genre as Bluegrass is a vehicle to misrepresentbluegrass music to an unknowing audience and an insult to allBLUEGRASS musicians and fans."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"No argument with the musicianship, which is sadly wasted on insipid songwriting and truly wretched lyrics. A song about a heartbroken lighthouse? Give me a freakin' break."
2,Where is the spice!,The whole record was like a dull ache. Have these guys ever considered picking up an electric guitar. The songs are what some would say a fresh batch of sunshine I read that line in a magazine about this trio once that is very corny to say about music. The quality is there and the songwriting is some what there but these guys are young if they want to get on the main country circuit they need to electrify themselves put some slick arrangments on there music and the two guys should put on wranglers and the gal in the middle well she's all right. If Nickel Creek wants to get cool and get on some kind of chart they need to spice up there look. Nickel Creek's sound is o.k though but should learn to have more fun.
5,Best new traditional music group in recent years,"I've enjoyed traditional music since my days, many years ago, in a Jug Band. This CD shows the amazing talent the Chris Thile has both as a mandolin player and singer. The brother/sister duo, I believe their names are Watkins, combine with Chris to make a masterful array of tradional songs sound hip yet completely traditional. As good in person as recorded, Nickel Creek can transform a room or audience into a Bluegrass jam session which erupts in applause after each song. This is a worthwhile addition to any collection of contemporary tradional music."
5,You won't be coming back down...,"Nickel Creek - both the band and the album - have totally blown me away. Besides having more talent in their pinkies than I have in my body, their musicianship is just amazing. I highly recommend this album. Nickel Creek could very well be the future of country and bluegrass."
3,See them live,"Chris Thile may be the best mandolin player on the planet. Unfortunately, this album doesn't showcase his talents enough. He blew away the audience at a recent live performance, but little of that kind of playing is captured on this release."
3,Iggy&The Stooges - 'Rough Power' (Bomp),"Apparently the third version of the Stooge's third album 'Raw Power' mixed by none other than David Bowie.You get remixed and improved sound on the Stooge gems,like ""Search And Destroy"",""Gimme Danger"",""I Need Somebody"" and the others.For die-hards only.What more can I say?"
1,Some major themes forgotten,"You can't have an all-time favorite tv themes album without the theme from Seinfeld or The X Files, just to name a couple. That's it."
1,OOOOOOOOOOOOH PLEASE MAN GET REAL PEOPLE A NO BUY !,MAN YOU CANT EVEN MAKE OUT MOST OF THE SONG MAKE'S YOU THINK YOUR CD PLAYER IS BUGGING AND NEEDS TO BE CLEANED OR 86/JUNKED MAN TV-GUIDE NEED TO WATCH WERE THEY PUT THERE LOGO OVER THEY MIGHT HAVE SOMEONE IN THE PARKING LOT LOOKING FOR THERE MONEY BACK WITH SMILE ON THERE FACE BUT NOT THE KIND YOU WANT TO SEE ON SOMEONE UNLESS YOUR CRAZY ALSO AND WANT TO HANG OUT AND HIT THE PIPE WITH THEM AND BUG OUT TOGETHER !!!!!!!
3,"Quite a disappointment, really","As a non-native English speaker (but a reasonably accomplished journalist and translator) I really looked forward to this book. After all, the excerpts I found online and in the readers' comments were wonderful... Unfortunately, I discovered that the reality of Crazy English is that of a quite ""normal"" textbook on rethorics. The examples are usually funny, but if you're experienced enough with English you don't really need anyone to explain you again what omophonics and ""false friends"" are. Oh, and the author really tends to be quite logorrhoic in his drive to show us how many words he does know - sometimes failing miserably with his explanations of Latin origin of words. Interesting, mildly fun but quite a disappointment, really."
4,classic soundtrack soars anew!,"This re-release of the CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG soundtrack is a great find. The original Rykodisc release was swiftly deleted, but this new reissue from Varese Sarabande is ample compensation. Dick Van Dyke and Sally Ann Howes are delightful in their performances as Caractacus Potts and Truly Scrumptious. Standouts in the strong Sherman Brothers score include ""Hushabye Mountain"", ""The Roses of Success"", ""Me Ole' Bamboo"" and ""Toot Sweets"".There are two prime numbers for Miss Howes to show her mettle (""Lovely Lonely Man"" and ""Doll on a Music Box""). Under-rated British musical star Anna Quayle, as the fearsome Baroness, has the cute ""Chu-Chi Face"" with Gert Frobe. Not just a children's musical!"
2,Flip-a-Face: Infant Animals,The book was recommended for infants through pre-schoolers. I bought the book for my 22 month old granddaughter. She flipped through it a couple of times and set it aside. Not much interest. The pictures are very basic. Not much opportunity for exploration or imagination. I think the book should be recommended for children up through 18 months old. I'll donate it to one of our local daycare centers.
5,Best book for a newborn,"This was my baby girls first book. I began reading it to her when she was only a few days old. The bold pictures that look like faces held her interest. She only was interested for a few pages at a time at first. By a month old, she was enjoying the whole book. At that point, she became ready to look at other books as well. She is now 8 months old and loves books! I think this book helped to foster that love of reading!"
2,Misleading headline,"""Art Profolio brand CLEAR PolyZip Envelopes by Itoya Our price is for 6 pcs - 8.5x11""I've used these before and they're great for organizing projects. I'm a freelance graphic designer and I use them constantly for my clients. Online they're a bit expensive till I saw this offer for $8.93. From reading the headline of course I wanted 6 for less than $10 but when my order arrived in the mail there was only one in the box. I won't be using this company again."
1,"""The whole thing was awful, but especially the ending.""","Not long before Paul Bowles's death he had a reunion with William Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg in a hotel room as part of a documentary called ""Let It Come Down: The Life of Paul Bowles.""When the subject of the Bertolucci film of ""The Sheltering Sky"" came up, Bowles said ""The whole thing was horrible, but especially the ending.""One assumes this got back to Bertolucci."
5,Very Good,"Among the most fulfilling movies in my cynematic experience. Sexual without pornography, humanity without sentimentalizing. A Bertolucci masterpiece. Recommended for anyone who genuinely hates commercial movies and for this reason isn't what you'd call a movie fan.It's quite a long time since I've seen The Sheltering Sky, and I happened to forgot its name. When I accidentally retraced its name, I rushed giving it a favorite review, which isn't the usual situation I find miself into."
1,The whine from the screen is driving me crazy!,"Two weeks after I bought my Tungsten E, the whine started. Palm says that this is normal and there is no reason for a refund. Now, the whine is worse and louder and my Palm is out of warranty. Don't buy this one, even though the price is getting so low."
1,Technical Problems with no technical solutions . . .,"This is my first handheld device, and I enjoyed using it until about 5 weeks after I had purchased it. At this point the hotsync operation ceased to operate. The thing is now useless for anything except as a calendar, and I can get one of those for a fraction of the cost. The tech support isn't very helpful - the thick Indian accents make the technician difficult to understand and they just read through the same list of trouble shooting techniques that you can find for yourself on the PalmOne website. At this point I have spent around 8 or so hours trying to get it to work without any success. This product is nice when it works, its just a matter of whether one wishes to risk the cost and pain of getting a product that does not work."
1,Not reliable,"I had TE for 11 months now, just died last night.The reason I picked TE are:1. I like Palm OS, and used it from model M100, so it is very easy for me to pick up.2. The price was decent, I wasn't going to spend >$200 on an electronic organizer.Now, I regret my decision very much. $200 worth of equipment is not cheap for me, and spending $200 I expect the instrument to last at least 5 years. I am not one of those people that like to change to new product every year (nothing wrong with that, it's just not me). And it is not worth it to get it fixed either due to it's poor warranty, if you could even call it that.My next PDA will not be a Palm/PalmOne made, I simple do not trust their product anymore. Sad because I really like their Palm OS. Time for me to learn Pocket PC."
3,Palm Tungsten E,"I ordered a NEW palm Tungsten E in a sealed box. I knew that the item was questionable because it has been discontinued for years. I loved my old palm and wanted one to replace it. I ordered it to only find that it wouldn't turn on without a charger cord. This shows that the battery is at fault. I knew this from experience. I contacted the seller and explained the problem. The seller granted me a full refund or the price of a battery on amazon. This seller was really good at communicating what had gone wrong. Most palms that set for a long time have battery failure. I work with electronics and can solder a new battery on. The seller gave a credit for it and I gave him a very positive rating. NEED TO KNOW if you buy this product. The battery might not work and Windows 7 doesn't work on it. Other than that, I would order another palm tungsten e , when the need arises."
1,Keeps dying!!,"While it is very reasonably priced, it is still not worth $199. Why, because it only works part of the time. In the last 85 days I have had 2 different Tungsten E's die on me. The first crashed (wouldn't do anything) after 16 days, luckily Office Depot replaced it without any problems. This one lasted over 2 months before it locked up. BUT, before it died, it would not sync properly. It said it was syncing... but it never did anything.** If you buy this, be sure to get an extended warranty. **"
2,For what it is worth...,"I purchased my Tungsten E in 2/2004. Was happy with it,no problems. Worked well for what I needed it for. Four months later it died, no matter what I did to it at the advise of internet support, it remained dead. I called their customer support hotline two times. The first time I was on hold for 30 minutes and never talked to a person. The second day I waited approximately 15 minutes and talked to someone who said my only option was to send it in and they would charge me an outrageous $125.00!! A new one is only about $50.00 more dollars. I have to wonder about the quality of their products if they only give you a dismal 90 day warranty and then it dies 4-5 months after purchase. It was not excessively or harshly used. The power button on my husband's Tungsten E has not worked since within approximately 4 weeks of purchase. PalmOne support is less than mediocre. Consider another model before buying this."
3,How many things can you name that can be held in the palm?,Is this actually palm sized?.. that's brilliant. Does it get any better than that? I mean carrying around your pc is just ludicrous. If I had a big important job or if I had lots-o-cash or was just smart and cool as heck I'd already have one but... I'll just stick to my television remote to fill my busy palm.
3,"Was reliable, but now I've lost some faith in it","I bought my Palm Tungsten E (used but in excellent shape) over a year ago. It has been working well, although I still have problems getting it to Hot Sync with my Office 2003 applications.About 6 weeks ago, it froze, then crashed. Once it was working again (after I reloaded all my information--calendar and contacts), I saw that I lost some of the programs. There is no longer a calculator function.I pressed the reset button, and lost more applications. I am tempted to go back to a Franklin Planner...good old paper and ink!"
3,TE- King of Buzzing,"I've had my TE for 2yrs. now & I've been very happy with everything except the loud whining sound that developed after about 16 months. After having visited the palm website & seen that the company is in total denial of the problem they have with whining pda's (almost all models develop a whine), I did a google search & found out how widespread the problem is. To make a long story short, if you're suffering from the infamous whine, go to Lightspeed (worked for me!), PXA Clocker, or Warpseed. Thankfully, there IS a fix for the whine, but it's unfortunate that P1 hasn't admitted a problem or provided the fix."
2,I so wanted to like this item....,"I wanted Palm to succeed so badly. I had a Palm back in 1996 way before anybody I know had one. I loved it. I thought they were the answer to my prayers compact, portable and reliable and with instant back-up at the push of the button. So I decided to upgrade my Palm, but these Tungstens are very different.I could list many things but let's begin with the graffiti on these Tungstens; it's all different from the old Palms more difficult to master. I just gave up and started typing in the information which is infinitely slower with the stylus. The stupid machine is crash prone and I am always rebooting it. The design is also bulkier and heavier than the old Palms. It doesn't fit into my shirt pocket like my old Palm.I am very disappointed and I am now looking to buy a windows based handheld like the Compaq."
2,"Was good till warrantee ended. ""Support"" is AWFUL!","It was nice while it lasted -- 94 days (the warrantee expired at 90). Customer ""support"" was useless. The one time I actually got a person on the line, we could barely understand each other. Although my problem was unrelated to my computer, she insisted on knowing what computer I was using, and as soon as I said it was a Mac, she transferred me to Mac oblivion. I gave up waiting after 10 minutes on a line that was crackling with static. I tried again and wound up waiting 15 minutes on a silent line -- didn't know if it was dead or not, so I hung up. I surely hope I won't be billed $50 for those two useless calls!"
2,Not a stable product.,The features are good. This is my first PDA. I got it as a gift in late February and it died within 1 week unexpectantly. I tried recharging the battery and soft and hard restarts to no avail. Customer support is poor and appears to be from the Phillipines with great difficulty hearing and understanding the techs. Very short warantee period (90 days). This must mean they don't trust the reliability of their own products.
1,quality rating = 0,"Great software, great idea, but the hardware wears out too fast, in less then a year of normal use, this PDA is useless, ohh, one more Made in China product!! crap!!!I wont buy again thats for sure!Do your self a favor, dont buy this S$#t, unless you get to know it was made in America, Europe or Mexico, some nation that makes products employing people with real salaries."
3,Crisp screen,I wanted more screen clarity so I bought this model. The price was reasonable. I am disappointed with this gadget for the same reasons as the previous reviewers. The manufacturers need to rethink this one.
1,"Nice Product, Terrible Support/Warranty","My first experience with hand held after my trusty HP 200LX. The functionality was great and I used it easily and quickly for 3 months. Then the Palm stopped working entirely - wouldn't turn on at all, 15 days after going out of warranty. Cost to repair $125. Palm told me to send it back to Amazon...as I might have better luck there.Most likely the last Palm product I will ever buy...and I'm not bashful about telling my friends my opinion either. If I ever risk another purchase of a Palm product, I will execise it to the nth degree while it is under warranty.By the way, the HP is still working flawlessly."
5,Spectacular! Sturdy and Safe.,Spend the extra 10 dollars and buy this one instead of the other brands which don't use cantilever technology. I put it together in under 5 minutes and it works to perfection. It's very stable and gentle to the door frame as well. I recommend this to everyone.
4,Very Pleased,"As advertised, this is a great little exercise item. I opted to spend the extra cash and get this over the Everlast model, mostly b/c of the bad reviews. I didn't want to risk getting hurt or ruining the door frame. It is very sturdy, easy to put up and take down, and does no damage whatsoever to the door. Highly recommended. Easy to assemble."
4,Works Like a Charm,"If your looking for a chin up bar that doesn't require bolting into a wall, this is the one you want. It's stable and fits my door like a glove. I ordered the wide grip bar and am really pleased with it as well. The only minor draw back is that the foam guards that rest on the door's frame leave small black marks. Otherwise, I'd give it a 5 star rating."
5,Easy and convenient!,"This is a great product. It's easy to install, use, and keep using to keep in shape when I can't always make it to the gym. It is tricky to use with older door frames (I live in a brownstone with original moulding) because of the thickness of the moulding, but fortunately I have a newer door frame at my bathroom door. Just make sure you door frame isn't too thick! Other than that, no complaints, a great find!"
3,"Weird grips, strict requirements","As others have noted, make sure your door fits the required measurements. The most unusual requirement is that the door be of particular width. None of the doors in my house fit the measurements. All of my doors are too narrow. However, the device still works in narrow doors, just wrap a towel around the metal that touches the door frame.What's not as easy to workaround are the painful hand grips. They're this dense, sticky foam that simply rips into your hands like nothing I've ever felt before. Every part of the hand that contacts this torturous material will be red and burning after you complete a set. I think that because the foam is slightly conforming, it's rubbing against my hands where there are no callouses from a normal metal pull up bar. Ouch! Makes me not want to do pull ups.That said, compared to other door pull up bars, this ones very high quality and solid. I never feel afraid the thing is going to break."
3,BE CAREFUL WHEN ASSEMBLING!,"When assembling the unit, I didn't make note of the two different sizes of screws. I used one of the longer screws in one of the holes that called for a shorter screw, and tightened the bolt. In trying to get the bolt off, I stripped out the screw casing, and the whole unit is useless now. The instructions are very sparse, so be careful before you tighten anything!"
3,"Decent chin-up bar, but lacks a wide grip","The Creative Fitness Door Gym is built well and works as intended. However, it does not have any wide grips. An attachment is available that adds a wide grip, but it is just a bar that rests on top of the original product...and it costs $20! In my view, there is really no reason to buy this product instead of a competitor's. There are other bars that are less expensive and provide narrow, neutral and wide grips. (Like theIron Gym Total Upper Body Workout Bar.) I wish I had purchased one of those instead."
3,Quality item / average design,"The bar works as described and is a quality item.The problem comes when I want to vary my grip width, to do wide grip pullups. The bar does not have foam grips in that location (between the protruding handles and the end). I have to use weight lifting gloves to get any kind of grip in that location."
3,PEOPLE!!!,"I'm one of those Animal Collective fans that wants to get everything they put out. If you're not, then this EP might not be for you. It has 4 songs on it. The first track, People, is a great song. It has two words in it: ""Yeah"" & ""PEOPLE!"" So it's easy to sing along to. The next track is Tikwid, a fun-filled melodic exercise that almost sounds like Grass. The third track is My Favorite Colours. It's short and quite forgettable. And then there's the live version of People, which I don't ever listen to because I think the vocals on the studio version came out a lot better. So, if you're an enthusiast, you'll need to get this. For moderate fans, only buy this if you have extra money and nothing else to spend it on."
1,stinks,"This stuff sound like it would be great. In reality, the fragrance is more like a cheap after shave- and strong!"
1,Won't fully function in Alaska or Montana!,"Everything about this product sounds so cool! I purchased two as gifts for Christmas. However, the fact that you can't connect to the Kindle Store from Alaska is not openly apparent on the Amazon website. I had to search the website and find this fact myself after receiving the Kindles and trying to, unsuccessfully, download my son's favorite books. I was able to return both Kindles for a full refund."
2,Its ok,"The idea of the kindle is really cool, but the exicution needs a little work. If you down load the books on your computer and add them to the kindle it works well, but the SPRINT wireless network, not so much.. I tried for a week to connect and had no results, and the kindle froze at least once everytime and needed re-setting. I was still unable to download any books wirelessly. The screen is easy on the eyes and the controle are easy to understand and use. If you like to read and don't want a ton of books cluttering up your house, go for it but beware that you may not get any wireless service where you are at any time and you will need a computer handy to get new books..."
4,I love my Kindle,I love my Kindle. I enjoy having many books right at my fingertips without carrying a box of books. I also have fun shopping online and on the Kindle for more books. My only problems are: I have had to reset it 4 0r 5 times since I got it a month ago. I am also disappointed in the battery life. My battery does not stay charged a long time like it was advertised.
4,Love My Kindle,I bought a Kindle a few months ago and absolutely love it. I carry it everywhere with me so if I'm caught having to wait I have something to do. The buttons on the side are touchy and it takes a little bit to get a comfortable way to hold it but once you do it makes reading a breeze. The clearity of the screen and how easy on your eyes it is is the best. It is pricy but if you are an avid book reader it's worth it.
4,kindle to the rescue!,"Needed the kindle for help in reading text, my eyes are slowly going...going..any with little help available from the medical world, exceot for replacements, the kindle allows me to read again...wish the kindle had an option that would allow the dictionary fonts to be enlarged...also the on and off buttons should be relocated to the front for ease of use....would like the ability to download books out of Google Books..would be glad to pay for these downloads...is that possible?, rtab.."
3,mixed blessing,"mixed blessing. i have arthritis in my hands. holding a paperback book was difficult and a hard bound was heavy. the kindle eliminates all of that. It is light weight and a click of the thumb makes it easy to change pages. it is easy to put in my purse when i travel, use while i wait in doc office or sit on the front porch. however, the letters are hard to push. more resources please."
2,imperfect,No proper printed manualWhen you hold it within a palm the thumb hits the page turn button!Inadequate keyboard etc etc
2,great idea...small design flaws causing major annoyances...,"no backlight and too small a next page function button...how could these have been missed for this awesome invention when there are so many examples along the way to which to refer prior to launch...simple fixes causing major annoyance!...besides these plus the high entry price point at a time when the economy is so shaky, this device is pretty cool..."
3,No Whispernet Connectivity Takes Half the Fun,"I just received my Kindle, and it is awesome to handle. I'm particularly impressed with the brilliant screen. Excellent readability even in bright sunlight, easy font change, nice navigation.However, I was very dissappointed to find out that - although I see 3-5 ""bars"" to indicate network availability - Whispernet is not supported in the area where we live. I had not seen anywhere that this could be an issue.I know I can download books ect. via USB, but not beeing able to use the wireless features cuts half off the fun and the usability."
4,kindle,"Very useful product, easy to read. I agree with the button issues that have been endlessly stressed in previous reviews."
5,2nd kindle to our home,"I liked my Kindle so well that I bought a second one for my husband. We both love to read and this solves our storage problems with so many books. We live in a small town that has a poor selection for books, so now we can find anything we like. This is the best ""book"" I ever bought!"
1,COLLEGE BOUND?,What about college text books? I would ONLY buy this product IF it offered college text books. The company should really think about considering this option. Otherwise to me it's pointless since I don't read anything except college books!
3,A request for developers of kindle,"I find this hardware incredibly useful for educational purposes with a few improvements.I'm a university professor and I would be very grateful to the developers of kindle for adapting this hardware like a classroom tool. It could substitute the chalkboard where the professor writes or the projecting devices to make presentations. The students would connect their class-kindles to the net opened by the professor and would see the result in their kindles, allowing them to record the explanations and to include their own comments.It is too a perfect tool to share notes and presentations in the subject. Besides, in one tool the students can manage all the subjects in their career.Hope to see this kind of hardware soon because electronic chalkboards are very expensive and need a net of laptops (also expensive) in the classroom to be useful."
2,good idea. JUST TOO FRAGILE,"I LOVE THE KINDLE FOR EASE OF USE, BUT HATE HOW FRAGILE THE HOUSING IS. I HAVE PAID FOR 2 KINDLES SINCE MAY OF 2008 AND HERE IT IS, THE 10TH OF SEPTEMBER AND BOTH ARE UNUSABLE BECAUSE THE SCREENS ARE BROKEN. ON TOP OF NOT BEING ABLE TO READ THE E-BOOKS I'VE PURCHASED, I ALSO HAVE REFERENCE BOOKS THAT I CAN NOT ACCESS. DO NOT PURCHASE UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY TO BURN!! I CALLED AMAZON AND WAS TOLD THEY CAN NOT REPAIR BROKEN KINDLES, AND THAT IF I WANTED ACCESS TO BOOKS PURCHASED,BUT UNREAD, I WOULD HAVE TO SHELL OUT ANOTHER $359 FOR A NEW KINDLE. GOOD IDEA, BUT NOT FINISHED."
3,"Miles to go before I read, miles to go before I read...","Difficult to use it like a book , darkness between page to page transition,inadvertant pressing of switches makes it very concious of the grip we have on the gadget,no color, no radio,no movie( not checked if it runs an animation. The cover supplied is very slippery, dont rely on it else you will break your book reader.Color (black is clumsy)NO WI_FI. We cant not read in Darkness( no internal Light to read book)Goodies: Text look is excellent, downloading speed is very good.Cost: first generation, we have to bear :)"
5,It's a New World!!,"I love my Kindle. I've had it for two weeks. Here are the biggest bonus' for me: Having control of the font size. As a reader with glasses since second grade - now at 42 years old I admit my eyes get tired and I become a lazy reader - with font size control - I have improved my comprehension of what I am reading. I don't ""skip"" anymore, I read all of it and love it. Having my books with me whenever and wherever. How awesome is that? If I'm getting bored with something, I can just start a new one, regardless of where I am. It's a reader's ""iPod"" - a must have for any serious reader. I'm left handed and I use either buttons to turn pages without any problem. It's genious. This should make Amazon.com into what Apple has now become with the iPod. I love it! I love it! I love it!!"
3,Alaska Kindle Kser,"This is a good product which wll hopefully get better over time. The screen contrast could be a little more definitive and brightness should also be improved.Because I live and use the Kindle in Alaska I definitely don't get the utility that lower 48 users get. While this is not a big market for Amazon, making the down load through the computer should be made easier.I have had to call the help desk two times and have recieved outstanding help in solving my problem both times. One tech was Colin. I'm sorry I don't remember the other because he was equally as good.Mike Case"
3,Giving a Kindle as a gift is absurdly complicated,"The Kindle itself is fine but the process of giving it as a gift is silly complicated. It arrives with the gift givers name on the Kindle and a complicated series of steps are required to make it the gift recipient's Kindle. Then they have to set up an account with Amazon of course.In addition, the operation manual assumes facts not in evidence and glosses over the basics so that many people will spend a lot of time when they should be enjoying their new device on frustrating details that are not apparent. Spending $1 on a FAQ written by someone that actually understands what the obvious questions will be is a necessity for those not of the techie persuasion."
1,It broke after less than 2 years,I can't believe I took a chance on Amazon and bought the original Kindle in 2008. It is less than 2 years old and it is completely broken - it freezes every time I turn it on. Amazon tells me that my only recourse is to send them another $70 and they will sell me a refurbished original Kindle. What a rip off. I will try B & N before doing that.
4,If you're disabled...,"My wife has a stroke that took most of her ability on her right side, but she was an avid reader. Books became a problem. The Kindle, which can be easily used with just one hand, is an excellent, if expensive, solution. She has a renewed interest, and reading has once again become an important part of her life. She's a big mystery fan and it's taking a little long for best selling mysteries to become available but I expect, as the Kindle becomes more widely used, that will change. Content availability will be crucial to its success or failure."
4,Where is the Library?,"I enjoy my Kindle a great deal. However, I am extremely disappointed in the availability of books in the book store. 200,000+ sounds like a lot of books but my fist seven searches revealed only one of my choices was available. My reading tastes are not that essoteric. I couldn't even get a book by Michenor. Also, I think an average price of $10.00 is high given the costs that have to be saved by not printing hard copies.Ron LawsonGoodyear, AZ"
1,kindle does not work,"sends me in circles ""tweet share that you have finished this book"" and back again. so what am i suposed to do next?"
2,"Great idea, but wrong on one primary level","First off, the good:1. Battery life looks great.2. The display looks really nice.3. I love the newspapers, blogs, and especially the free Wikipedia access.4. The integrated store with built in free wireless access is genius.THE BAD:1. Amazon goofed BIG TIME. If Amazon really wanted to make ebooks successful, they should have provided a free utility to convert text files into ebooks, in their format. There are tons of free, public texts around for this. They shouldn't worry about cannabilizing their own sales since the reader costs $400. Last I check, the Apple model is pretty successful and they're making money off the hardware (iPod), not the sales of songson iTunes.2. The design is not that great. Sony's reader looks better and is essentially the same technology."
4,New Version Due Out?,I heard on NPR a number of weeks ago that a new version of Kindle will be made available. Any idea when this will happen? Will the price be the same?
5,Love it....!,"Love it. For future updates, it needs to have a way to be password protected in the event of theft. For someone who is a ""junkie romance reader,"" it would be nice to have updated series books more readily available. Overall, I have been very pleased."
4,Kindle,I love being able to buy a book at my finger tips and take it with me everywhere I go. I was disappointed that I couldn't get some books my book club was reading for that was my main reason for getting it. At first it was tricky holding it without touching the sides since that would turn a page but once I got use to holding it from the top and off to the bottom side I stopped flipping pages. That is something Kindle needs to work on. I still love my Kindle but am not looking forward to changing batteries for it.
5,Kindle,I leave for a 3 month vacation to Costa Rica in January. The Kindle will cut my luggage in half. I love to read and the thought of having to carry all the books with me convinced me I needed the Kindle. It is very easy to use and is small enough to fit in my purse. Shopping and downloading the books could not be any easier. I am very happy with it.
4,My Kindle,"I think the Kindle is a great device. You can take all your books with you in one small device. It is a good size but it needs to be easier to hold without touching the NEXT PAGE button on the right side and have the on and off button placed in an easier position to get to. Overall, it is a great product and I am glad I purchased it."
2,Kindling!,"price point - too high $100 I'd buy.What no native PDF? There goes the biz purchase.Lose or minimize the keyboard. Go touch screen or offer bluetooth or a sliding KB.Color? how do illustrations look?Can you use gutenberg and UV E-text files?How about E-Textbooks from campus?Can you highlight text and hear it read ala Kurzweil, MS Reader and Wynn with a human-like voice? If not you lose my purchase recommendation for the disabled - I provide Assistive Technology Services.Overall a good start, but not enough to compete with Sony or push me over the edge for a test purchase.Finally, Kindle? Jeff you're just asking for grief. You'll hear about it on Letterman after the strike."
3,"Its a good e-reader, but.....",The device uses electronic ink paper technology which makes reading very easy on the eyes. It's a good portable device but it does have its drawbacks. The first is the design - it's difficult to pick up while its on without paging forward or backward. The second are subscriptions such as newspapers - you have to either leave it connected to the wireless system all the time (fast battery drain) or you have to remember to download the newspaper every day. If you forget to get Tuesday's edition you're out of luck on Wednesday. Third - availability of books. Before buying the unit you should try to determine if the last 10 books you read are available. That will give you an indication of how up-to-date the selection will be for electronic books that you would be interested in reading.
3,Not as good as I expected,"The kindle is not as good as I expected. I thought I would like to read from an electronic device, but I don't. I am constantly accidently pressing the buttons on the side. It's hard for me to keep up with my reading."
3,Samples only with Whispernet. No organization of books.,"For the most part I enjoy my Kindle. I am slowly getting used to avoiding the previous/next keys until needed. I have learned to adapt my existing e-books, and other personal items I wish to read, to its format. I do not regret the purchase. On the other hand, the lack of organization options (e.g. FOLDERS), is a major problem! How could anyone build a reading device and advertise it's storage capacity without including a method to categorize that collection?! I can only hope this will be rectified in the future. I would have given this 4 stars but for the price of this unit, some way of categorizing should have been included.BTW...contrary to Amazon's current advertising, you cannot download and transfer everything from the Kindle store without Whispernet access. Samples of books are ONLY available by wireless download. Hopefully Amazon will include this fact somewhere online soon."
4,Loved it so much we bought two!,"My husband and I fought so often over who got to use the Kindle, that we recently purchased our second one. We love this product and the ability to share our on-line Amazon library between both devices really fueled our decision to purchase another. We couldn't be happier!"
5,Really enjoyed my Kindle for Amazon and non-Amazon material,The Kindle has been great! I received it the day before we left for a 12-day vacation and I loaded it up with books and some converted PDFs I needed for work. I also pulled down a couple classic books from ManyBooks.net (use [...] to download directly to your Kindle).The Kindle works well in full daylight and I used it to read on the beach.
5,Love it!,No more lugging two or three books on long flights. No more worrying that I'll be bored with the book I brought. No more books to fill up already-stocked limited bookshelf space.The only down-side. Not EVERY book is available -- yet!
1,Needs to Match the Way We Acquire Reading Material!,"Um . . . for me to buy this product, I would want to use it every day. I read all the time, but I read books lent to me, I get books from the library, I buy used books and now and then I buy a new book. This product assumes I would always buy new - and always from the same place. I think you need a Netflix type model here rather than a store model. And really, I wouldn't OWN the book at that price, nor would I be able to share it. Sharing books is half the fun!"
3,need screen reader compatibility with Kindle,"I really would like to see this device (and others like it) be able to be used with a screen-reader that reads the text aloud. This would be helpful for individuals with visual impairments, learning disabilities, people learning to read, etc. What a great assistive reading tool it would be!! The high-lighting, note-taking, and dictionary functions seem helpful, but having read-aloud functionality would open up portable, accessible reading to a whole new customer base. There seems so much potential with this type of product!"
2,Don't buy until books priced fairly,"Most reviews overemphasize the cost of the device. Its the books that are the main rip-off, however. Digital books are reproduced at minimal cost compared to paper books yet Amazon is charging basically the same price for a digital book as for the same paper one. I suggest everyone avoid Kindle until the bugs are worked out, the cost is well under $200, a backllight is provided and most importantly:SLASH THE COST OF DIGITAL BOOKS, CUT OUT THE RIP-OFF PROFITS!!! Charles Michael"
3,I like it but it needs work,"Overall I like the device. Text is clear. Love being able to go to Wikipedia or online right from the device. Music playing works well. Some thoughts on improvements:a) Cover: Could not get it to fit right. If I put the band, it presses on of the keys.b) Going to Amazon and Wikipedia is free. Wish the cost of going to other sites would be clearly marked.c) Too many buttons on the front, makes it difficult to hold without pressing any key.d) Because of the buttons, I found it easier to read it with the cover (its not being held tightly notwithstanding). But when I did that, I had to reach over with my right hand to press the back key. Would have preferred page keys all on one side and leaving the other side empty.e) Looks a bit chintzy. More work needed there.Overall, I like it but it still needs some work."
5,love it,"David gave this kindle to me, his mothe, for my 77th birthday. I have macular degeneration and it helpa me to read. I have it set on the largest font, and since there are only a few sentences in view I don't get lost. So far, I am reading Audition, Barbara Walter's book. I really enjoy it since we are of similar age, and I remember so much of those times."
1,Thumbs Down!,"It is unfortunate that Amazon is selling a product that only uses proprietary files. The ability to read and learn is what has advanced mankind. Now Amazon wants a monopoly on what we can read on a device we own. Why can the Kindle on read proprietary files? What if I have other eBooks or other files (I have 100s of pdf files that are loaded with knowledge)? Why sell us a $400 product that can only be used for files only Amazon sells? I liken this to a monopoly. Please Amazon, open this up! You have the potential to have a great product, but you restrict its usability severely.I think it is interesting that the only people who are giving this 5 stars are the ones who are somehow involved with this project."
3,Kindle loses a little of it's coolness,I do love my Kindle BUT where I am living for the summer there is no wifi connection. This is a problem in many parts of the US. I might not have purchased had I known about the somewhat limited wifi coverage.
4,kindle wireless readind device,this is a replacment item. I have had trouble with 3 previous units. this one seems to be functioning properly
5,"Received a Kindle for Christmas, and I love it!","The Kindle is great. Here are just a few things that I'm really excited about with it:- Easy to read on a treadmill with larger font sizes, and no need to hold the book open.- All of your books with you, all the time.- Document transfer to the kindle (PDF, DOC, TXT, etc) through email is really easy- Many great books are really cheap, some $2 or $3.- Free First Chapters of all books- Built-in dictionary is really useful"
3,Wiki-what!?!?!?!,"I was very excited about the Kindle. I can't afford to purchase one right now, and after doing some research regarding the type of text that are available (mainly airport novels and Oprah picks), I don't know that I will ever buy one. My biggest complaint is the Kindle's ""ability"" to connect to Wikipedia. Shame on Amazon for promoting the use of Wikipedia. I know everyone already uses it, but to provide access to a credible dictionary alongside the non-fact checked Wikipedia is a crime. If Amazon can provide Kindle users access to books, blogs, etc., why not provide them with access to the Oxford Reference Online, www.oxfordreference.com, which provides a number of CREDIBLE reference texts including many encyclopedia."
3,page buttons,The forward and previous page buttons should be shorter and near the top to enable the reader to hold the kindle easier while reading without accidentally pressing a button.Screen is very easy to read.
4,A Reader's BFF,"I have purchased one, then one more, then, yesterday, another one for family members. My mother, age 83, is just over the moon for the Kindle. My daughter had me order one for her also. The three of us have been sharing books for many years and have pretty much the same taste. In the long run this is a great investment, especially for family members who read constantly and share books.The cover is hard to use unless you add velcro, which I did. The cover is the only reason I would give it 4 stars rather than 5. My mother uses her Kindle without the cover."
3,Kindle,"The Kindle is a nice reading device, however I find that the bars to turn the pages are not located in the ideal places. Or, perhaps the page turning bars are too sensetive to the touch. I also think that the Kindle support book cover does not hold the Kindle securely. I had to replace my Kindle because it fell out of the cover on to a ceramic floor and it was damaged. I hope revisions are in the works for this device."
2,Waiting for improvements,I ended up sending my kindle back b/c I wasn't aware that all the authors were not part of the kindle and 2 of my favorites were not included. I'll wait.
3,kindle review,"the kindle works very nice but the product support is really bad. My kindle has a product defect in the screen and have written to customer support over a week ago and have not heard back from them as to what I should do, ie. shipping costs, current downloads and bookmarks, etc. Hope to hear from them soon."
4,Security,"I like how easy it is to use, and that i can order books from any where. The security is just not good enough. It would be very easy for someone to order books without my consent. Im suprised at the company because even the most basic electronic devices have a lock function. It would be nice to have a larger variety of books also."
5,Kindle Reader,"My husband is a voracious reader! Our daughters and I gave him the ""Kindle"" for Father's Day. He thinks this is the best gift ever. He takes it everywhere with him. We recently took a vacation trip to Mexico and all he had to take for entertainment was his ""Kindle"". It downloads books in seconds, is easy to handle and to read. It created quite a stir from other guests reading out by the pool. Thank you for this wonderful invention for avid readers!"
2,"500 Cable channels and nothing on, wait a few years","Wait a few years:#1 Too expensive. A cheap laptop with far more capability is only $100 more.#2 Too few of the books are ones I want to read. The situation is similar to cable TV: 500 channels and nothing to watch.#3 Crippled books. The Kindle version of the book may not be the same as the print version. You won't know until you buy the Kindle version and compare it to the print version.#4 No easy way to share a book with your wife. The book is locked into a physical Kindle. On the other hand, if you can afford $800 for two Kindles you probably can afford to buy each book twice.#5 A nifty toy for early adapters. But not a practical device for reading books.#6 Let me download the book to my laptop. Don't make me buy and carry around another device.#7 This product was rushed to market before it was ready. Why?"
1,Kindle,Cheap. Badly designed. Difficult to use. Compare your item with the quality that is inherent in the IPhone. You tried to save money and it shows.
4,So far soooo good!,My friend has a kindle and she's let me read several books on it. I found it to be an excellent experience and I've put it on my Christmas list.
2,Nice but beware of Screen Problems,"The screen went out after reading just 1 book on the Kindle. Amazon kindly replaced it with no hassle, although everything I did on it was lost forever like the blocking off important information. The new one arrived, but it was not programmed for me so it has yet to be used almost a month later. Had I known I would lose all my important information due to faulty screens, I wouldn't have purchased it in the first place. It is nice but beware of screen problems."
3,No audio?,"The new Kindle is a great idea, but as far as I can tell, there is no audio option. The material will be not be accessible to blind and dyslexic potential customers. In addition, many people enjoy hearing books as well as reading them, depending on the text and the environment."
2,"No internet. Too expensive. Come on, Amazon!","I'm trying to figure out what makes this thing better than a tablet PC.It would be great if this thing had a wi-fi enabled web browser, but it doesn't.It would be great if this thing had a phone in it, but it doesn't.In this day of iPhones and cell phones with integrated MP3 and web capability, this device seems a litte horse after the cart.It would be perfect for my elderly mother who loves to read, but has difficulty with the large print books she needs because of what they weigh. She doesn't care about web browsing or email. Problem is, she is in the minority.I would buy this for my mother if it was like $250, not $400."
5,I love the Kindle!!!,I bought my Kindle on my daughter's recommondation. She said it was easy to use and even I could buy books and operate it. Well she was right!! I really like the adjustable font(this is great for aging vision)and the ease of buying books.I would highly recommend this for every hard to buy person. Save a tree buy a Kindle!
1,Amazon should apologize for Kindle delays over Christmas!!!,"With all the hype about ordering Kindle for the holidays I ordered early - in November, figuring I'd give it a shot despite the high price and semi-negative feedback. So, imagine my dismay with a week to go before Christmas - and not only has the thing never shipped - I now get a little cheerful snowflake-clad announcement that it won't even arrive until AFTER Christmas! A MONTH AFTER I ORDERED IT! Maybe Amazon shouldn't be hyping their products if they can't build enough of them to deliver for the holidays. Maybe they should put their current ads on hiatus until they can at least fill their back orders. I am VERY disappointed. At this cost point, had I known that the product would not reach me by the holidays, I would have simply purchased something else.Shame on you, Amazon!"
1,I have to pay for blogs?????,"I can't believe there is a monthly subscription fee ($.99) for each blog, and such a limited number (just over 300) to choose from. My blog tastes are entirely too esoteric to be satisfied by the Kindle. I'm just not sure what other device this one satisfactorily replaces. There's potential here, but it's WAY too early!"
4,Amazon's Kindle,"The Kindle is a good substitute for a book and I like the one I just bought.First, let me run through the negatives.It is pricey - mine cost almost $400 with New York tax (there is no shipping charge).It needs to be reset if you leave it off the charger too long.It doesn't have color capabilities so don't use it to buy a book of great art. The black and white pictures aren't so great either.Now to the positives.It is lightweight, easy to read (you can increase the font size which is useful if you're my age), and easy to carry and handle. It is very well designed and is user-friendly.It is a snap to download books and they are cheaper than book stores.In a few years, kids will not have to fill book bags, they can just kindle them and use their Kindles.If you lose your Kindle or if it is stolen, Amazon can cripple its functionality. Unlike an IPod, this will make it less attractive to thieves.Overall, this is a new entry into a very promising technology. I recommend it highly."
3,Constructive feedback,Overall a good product . . . it does what it says it does. I regret only two things: you cannot read this in low light or darkness and Whispernet does not work where I live (I am only able to get ATT / Cingular cell service).
4,electronic reading device,"Unit doesn't stay in cover very well when opened. Clip on inside of cover doesn't stay up.Takes getting used to in handling so you don't skip pages.Downloads work as advertised. All in all, should provide an easier way to have reading material on the road or about town without carrying a heavier book or books."
4,Modern Day Technology,"Love the product. Perfect gift for anyone who loves to read but doesn't want to carry a suitcase full of books. Product suggestions for Kindle. They should color coat some of the buttons for easier button recognition. They should change the cursor color from silver to red for easier viewing and navigation. Difficult to see the cursor move up and down on the cursor bar. Perhaps enlarge the cursor as well. And finally... if Kindle could make accessible, required reading curriculum for college students. No more looking for a parking spot, no more trying to locate books at the student book store and then finding out they are sold out, no more waiting in line for hours to purchase books you really don't want in the first place :) and no more carrying back breaking books. One click and your done! Saves gas, saves time, saves your back, saves the environment."
2,"Carpal Tunnel, Eyesight and Kindle","I have carpal tunnel syndrome. Kindle has to be held in a certain position to avoid pressing the previous page or next page bars (a design flaw). This position within minutes produced the numbness and tingling of carpal tunnel syndrome.I use 2.0 diopter reading glasses. Even on the highest print size, without glasses, the print was fuzzy unless I was in direct sunlight (outside) then it was ok.It was too large to fit in my purse or coat pocket and the bookcover does not fully protect it. The cover should be zippered.Otherwise, I really loved it."
1,Charging for blogs???,"You know this Kindle really grabbed my attention when I first saw it. I thought this might be something I would want to purchase. That was before I saw that they plan on charging for blogs that I can go read everyday for free through my browser or RSS reader. Amazon, you got greedy.. I would of spent loads of money paying for books and magazines to be downloaded to my Kindle, but instead you had to go for all the cash and charge for something that I can get free. No thanks."
3,Read before you buy,"I own the Sony ebook, it has similar screen size. The screen is too small for any books other than novel. Most books that I read have graphs, formulae, tables and boxed text. The current screen size will not do, I sampled 20-30 of the books that I have, the min screen size has to be 6x9"" in order for scanned page to be displayed properly.However, if you only read novels or anything that has minimal amount of graphic/tables, this is absolute wonderful. I use a PDF printer driver to make PDF file from web pages (I do some editing using MS Words) and read it on trains.With the subscription service, it makes Kindle more useful (I guess), but its lack of PDF support is a absolute no-no for me. Besides, it look really ugly. In the age of iPod, I wonder why people still not pay more attention to design and user experience."
4,good as it gets,"The reason I wanted an older one was for its size:bought it for my mother and I liked the idea of something a little closer to the size of a book,without its weight of course. She is loving it!"
5,Kindle Review,"Love the Kindle. It is very easy to use and really will revolutionize the way you read books.I live in a small town and I have ""zero"" bars for the whispernet. (the way you buy books and download directly to the kindle) But it is very easy and quick to download the books to your computer and then use the USB cord to connect the kindle. So even though my kindle is out of range to download wirelessly, the kindle still lives up to my expectations."
5,an ipod for books,"i am an avid reader and in my opinion i think the kindle is fantastic, i am telling all my friends about it. it is so easy to use. i like that you can view a sample of the book before purchasing instead of wasting money on a book and realizing the book is not good. It is cheaper to buy a book in kindle format. I do hope that there will be more magazines that you can purchase in kindle format in the near future. With the holidays coming, the kindle is a great gift idea."
2,Not bad--if only for the region differences,"I bought kindle due to the advertisement i saw on the site. I've been looking for something similar for a long time. I read a lot of books. It really does look like you're reading paper, and it's very light. My major problem was that I didn't know about the region thing. You can only use an American credit card and the wireless will only work in the US. I have to hassle someone who has an american credit card (really hard to do) to get a book and i forgot about the wireless thing.If this thing was supported globally it would've been excellent"
5,"The ""Read-a-holic's"" Dream Machine!","This is a superb product! Too often I will find myself in a situation where I am out of reading material. My Kindle supports my ""habit"". Also, I am able to affordably indulge myself at all hours of the day and night!One suggested improvement...add a local time display at the bottom of the screen that users can either set manually, or automatically via wireless network."
3,Still Hopeful....,"I have read so many terrific reviews about this product; however, my experience wasn't quite so wonderful. My kindle arrived in a timely manner and when it arrived I couldn't wait to get home and play with it! I even showed it off to everyone at work right out of the box and boy were they jealous. Unfortunately, this excitement soon wore off when I was only able to download one book before it started freaking out on me. The keypad wouldn't return the same letters I was inputting, the scroll feature would reset to the bottom before I had a chance to dive into any of the documents to read, and finally it just pooped out all together. In all fairness, the support folks were pleasant and walked me through some of the possible reset options and when they still didn't help put in to send me a new one. I have to wait several weeks though since the Oprah show did the inventory in. Hopefully the next round will work otherwise I'm gonna have to hang up my Kindle until they work out the bugs."
4,Kindle review,"A great toy especially if you need a larger font. Sometimes the next page bar is too easy to hit and the page suddenly changes, resulting in back and forth pagination.Does not stay very well in the (supplied) cover if tilted to the right. Takes time to get used to it.Would like to know if 2 people are reading the same book, will Kindle bookmark for both readers. I cannot find any info on this."
5,Sooo Satisfied With My Kindle,"This product makes my library convenient to me anywhere. The prices for the Kindle books are so reasonable, it makes it hard to resist purchasing new books as often as the mood strikes you. I LOVE the sample feature, too. You don't just get page of the book, but an entire chapter to help you get a feel for whether or not the book will be to your liking. At $359 I had to think hard about purchasing this (a bit pricey), but I can now say it was well worth the money. Of course, I take extra precautions keeping track of it -- it would be difficult to replace the device at this cost. I'm really enjoying owning my Kindle and would highly recommend it to anyone considering buying one."
2,What a pain this kendle has been!,I have yet to down load my audio book from Audible.com. I was able to download to my computer (Mac) but not to my Kendle!!I do have a book on my Kendle but I would also like to have audio books on my Kendle.
3,Mr. Bezos - If you're reading this... Some suggestions,1. Take some pointers from the cell phone industry; dramatically lower the price of the Kindle; as you will make far more in content delivery.2. Allow users with PCs to download MS Word documents and pdf's with conversion software on their PC; PC users won't warm to the fee charged for the conversion service. The fee is fine for users who don't have documents with them; or don't have access to a pc.3. Negotiate a discounted subscription price for periodicals for users who already have hard-copy subscriptions.
5,Great so far!,"I received my Kindle a few days ago. As it stands now I love it. It's great on the subway when I only have one hand to use. It is light weight. I have had no problems finding books I want to read. On the contrary really, I had too many I wanted to load up right away!I love the built in dictionary. Makes it so easy to look up a word you don't know, instead of putting your book down and getting a dictionary or looking it up on a computer. The fist day I had Kindle I spent a few hours reading and I had no eye strain. I give the Kindle an A+"
2,Question on the capability,"Hi,It is very intriguing and since I travel it could the perfect device. Can I transfer and view PDF documents on this - this will let me have a copy of all the technical documentation? The highlight only says Word and imagesThanksNick"
2,Reading at night,"After all the effort to create the Kindle, WHY IS THERE NO BACKLIGHT ON THE SCREEN SO YOU CAN READ WITHOUT AMBIENT LIGHT???????"
3,not too crazy about it.,"i'm not too crazy about it -- the pros: the dictionary lookup, the ability to collate all your notes; the cons: the blink of the screen when you turn to the next page ( i hate this feature), the first kindle book i downloaded didn't have any of the footnotes references available, the pages of the book are called locations which is an odd way of numbering the ebook. And also, i had to reset my kindle a few times already. Otherwise, it will just be in power-on mode and seems to be just stuck in a loop."
3,my problems with the Kindle,"this is the third kindle, the first 2 had to be changed, one at 50% reduction in price the second free. I love my kindle but it is a bit fragile and it still has a few kinks.the service however is wonderful and the response very fast.N mahdavi"
1,Weak..tireless promotion won;t make it better,"I wish I could find better things to say. Not enough for the bucks. $400 Too much for a dedicated device and too restrictive. Anything this utlitarian should have support for other files types as a universal reader. There's a reason why paper is still around - I imagine that when the software gets much better, the file type support improves, screen/weight improve and the price comes way down then it will sell to those who want vs want to try it. Save your money! You'll be able to try on eBay other wholesale lots when the price is nicked by at least 50%."
1,Book>Kindle,"Two Massive problems with the Kindle Approach:1. Battery. The Battery life is already incredibly inferior to the book (infinate) and the battery, along with the rest of it, will be deteriotated in a couple years.2. Price. How dumb can Amazon be? The way to overcome peoples nestolgia for books and the limited battery and electonic life would be to make it cheap. A $200 dollar inital price and $3 books would have been enough to spark a revolution, but instead the starting price is $400 and the books are as expensive as store doubt. So you spend $400 dollars on a device that is less convenient, can't bring books at a cheaper price, and will be unusable in 3 years? I don't understand."
1,I really want to like this thing...,"First, I investigated the Sony version, but didn't like what seemed like very limited content for it.Then I found this one--and as a fan of Amazon, I'm loving the idea of having access to more content.But this object is simply too ugly to own.I'd cut it some slack on functionality since it's a first generation gizmo. But who designed this thing? I've seen clock radios from the 1970's with more style. Is this thing supposed to look retro?Hire a product designer who understands aesthetics and the value of the ""feel"" of a thing. Ipods are sensual. This thing is brittle."
2,"Fool me twice, shame on me",I have ebooks and audiobooks that are completely useless because they are locked to my old laptop with DRM. They got me; don't let them get you.Don't buy anything with DRM!What are you going to do with your ebooks 5-10 years from now when Kindle is long gone?
5,the greatest reading machine in the world,This is the best machine ever. I love it. I am constantly sitting in doctors offices with my mom and son and it is so much easier to take the kindle than a book. It is lighter and easier to read. It also saves me space in the house. Instead of trying to find a spot for another book I can just load it on the machine. What a great idea.
2,Improvements needed until I purchase Kindle,"I've been looking at Kindle for awhile, but I won't purchase it until at least two specific upgrades are added. 1) The screen should be touch interactive to allow for a pointer device to highlight words/passages. This would be similar to note-taking that you could store either within another file on the Kindle, or at least refer back to through a bookmark. 2) This device could truly be revolutionary if there were either an internal dictionary or web-linked dictionary (e.g. via m-w.com) that would allow you to double click the world to grab its definition.Any other users think these would be good additions? Bezos - are you listening?"
3,Great idea!!! but.....,"Nothing more then an idea to the market place. yes, the Kindle is a new product and it's eye candy! however, this Kindle isn't worth the price it's a little more then a basic PC if I wanted to read (for free or pay) I'd rather buy a cheap computer less then 100 and use it! to read! this would possibly solve global warming, but this product. isn't something people are going. to buy right away! this product needs to go down in price and I do in-fact like the idea of transferring what you read on the Kindle. and make it a PDF and send it to yourself VIA e-mail. still... a good idea needs a little more features and a different price. also the idea of making it look like your reading it. as if it's on paper is a good idea as well... but not going to buy it!"
5,Simply amazing!,"Two little words to describe the best new ""toy"" I've bought in years. Like to read, love the feeling of having lots of books with you, going all at once? Travel a lot? THIS IS THE PRODUCT. Can't wait for more and more books to become available."
4,Needs an mp3 player,"Kindle is an awesome idea. However, it needs an MP3 player with flash memory. This should be an easy and surmountable enhancement for the next generation Kindle. One may then travel with reading material and music: awesome."
2,Brainrush,"First, the book is not a good one. After the interesting initial anecdote, the brain accident, the book becomes a cliche. Personally, I deleted the book after reading 20%.Second, it is strange to find sooooo many 5 stars reviews...!Third, the price is right.Fourth, I selected a Jack Reacher novel at 10 times the price and I'm satisfied.By the way, the name Juliano is not italian. Giuliano is."
3,Battery Issues,"Convenient to carry around and read. I liked the newspapers. The screen would stall when the battery was low, even after just 30 minutes of reading. Product info said it should last days. I still like the feel of a real book and paper pages in my hand. It would be great for travel, but I don't travel much any more."
5,Simple but Elegant,"When I saw the Kindle on the Oprah Show, I knew that my very smart, very technical, educator daughter would love it. She did! She was so excited when I gave her an early Christmas present that she started it up immediately, and within about 5 minutes she had it opened, charging, and had ordered her first book from Amazon. She pronounced it very intuitive and told me that it was exactly what she had wished for several years ago. Next thing I knew she was showing me how easy it was to use and I was reading the first chapter. To me, it's magic! I'm looking forward to receiving my own for Christmas. I'm glad I didn't hesitate to purchase the Kindle. It's a quality gadget that's going to be very popular with all ages."
5,AMAZING !!,"I just got my kindle today and am loving it!! I've read some of the other reviews and it appears that no one has taken the time to read the instruction manual to understand how powerful this device really is. For avid readers, being able to sample books before buying them is priceless. I have been using the Irex Iliad, SONY PRS-500 and most recently the SONY PRS-505 and feel that Kindle is a superior device thanks to the book sampling option, wireless content delivery, cheaper book pricing, keyboard, gmail access, web searching.. need I go on? I love being able to check my gmail while traveling. You really need to play with the unit for a few hours to appreciate what Amazon has to offer. I would have no qualms recommending this device to others."
2,Wait for Apple or someone else to do it right,"What can I say that others haven't already? I don't like the screen (4 grays, come on!), I don't like the keyboard (which is a waste of space most of the time if you use this as it is intended, as a book reader), I don't like the little rollerball cursor, I just don't like much about Kindle. I'm a gadget nut, and I've been waiting for a portable media reader that could take the market by storm. Unfortunately, this isn't it."
2,no service in many place so ...like east hampton ny overseas etc,"The Kindle is always connected to Sprint's EV-DO (Evolution-Data Optimized) network unless it's outside the coverage area, in which case it switches to Sprint's slower 1x system."
1,Kindle,"I was extremely disappointed to find out that after purchasing 2 Kindles, (one for a gift which I gave)after watching the Oprah show, to find out that we are not able to use them in Canada. I have returned them, after requesting the gift back, on November27/08 and am now awaiting a credit. Would dearly love to have the ability to use it in Canada!"
3,KINDLE,"There are many praises, more than 300 words. However, there is one problem I found immediately. Both sides of the kindle have page forward/back which run the full length of the kindle. This makes it very hard to hold the ""book"" and not change the page in error. Just think about how one holds a book and now we have to place our hands in an awkward position in order not to advance or go back a page while reading. Another design in the future, one side only or not the full length of the kindle. Really disappointed with this design. No other complaints, every other aspect is quite good."
1,Not working!,"Unfortunately, the Kindle I purchased is not working at all. It will not download anything from the internet either with a cable or wireless. It is of no use whatsoever."
4,Jerry's review,"good, but should have choice of colors and right side page should be smaller or the on off should be on front or side of product!"
4,kindle,"I will never go back to buying paper books again. The Kindle is life changing. Once I had email, I never went back to writing letters. The product is good but could still use some improvements. I am sure these will come over time."
3,Missing my Kindle,"I had my Kindle for 2 weeks when it fell out of the poorly designed cover and hit the floor. The hit wasn't hard and didn't affect the screen but it will not turn on now. I will send it in and hope it will not cost much to fix. I plan to buy some velcro that I can put on the back of the kindle and on the cover to create a secure attachment. Additionally, I agree with another review about how easy it is to accidently hit the back button. What a pain to have to find your last spot! I also was quite let down when I learned you can't read in the dark with it."
4,Kindle,"Would like the previous and back button to be smaller and at the top on both sides so that while you are holding it-you don't hit the button accidentally. Also, would like the on/off and wireless button on the front so that you do not have to turn the unit over and take it out of the holder. Would like the holder to be more secure- too easy to drop the unit out of the holder. Also, needs a light. It is a great concept and it is wonderful for trips when you want to read but do not have the room for all of your books."
5,Love my Kindle,I love the Kindle. I can't wait for some of my favorite authors to use Kindle for their material.
3,Handle with care,"I bought a Kindle. While the video on the ""drop test"" is interesting, I dropped mine about the same distance and the screen BROKE and is just black with some stripes. Amazon doesn't have any Kindle authorized repair services, so I have to pay $180 to get a replacement. BUMMER!!!! I like the Kindle otherwise, at least for traveling. It isn't the same as having a book in your hands and being able to flip through the pages, but it is convenient. It's also very easy to spend money - downloading books is a snap, and those $9.99's add up! I think either the basic design or the case that comes with should offer more protection against breakage. I didn't throw it or step on it or drive over it - it just fell out of the trunk of my car and now it's dead. $180 is a LOT for a replacement given how much I paid in the first place!"
1,How could they forget the most important part,"I really can't believe they wasted 3 years making this and not one person said to them hey it should be in color. If people are going to subscribe to magazines surely they will want to see the photos associated with it in color as they would had they bought the magazine in the first place. Before anyone goes on about size and weight, Technology is in a place now where it could be the same size and weight because its color. Sorry Amazon I think you really made a mistake here and it goes to show that such things are best left to the big companies to do."
2,Too Expensive,A Kindle in every pot? I think not. This product is innovative but too expensive for the average reader.
1,Disappointed wannabe,"I live in NW Montana... NO coverage unless I go about 50 miles into Idaho. I know I can download to my computer, but our DSL company has also decided to ""limit"" our download. So... no instant newspaper, blog, or magazine. It would be a book Reader, only. Pretty expensive for that.I was sooooooooooo excited when I heard about the Kindle. We have such limited access to things, here in the middle of nowhere, I thought this might be the perfect answer.Will coverage improve?"
5,THE GREATEST INVENTION SINCE THE PRINTING PRESS,"I love my Kindle because it is so portable, makes easy reading and saves paper. You see, ever since I got occular implants and no longer need glasses I do need a bit larger print for more comfort. With font size available I can change the size of the print when my eyes tire. Also, I find I can read faster with a smaller page. I can really get right into the device, blocking out all distractions. Since I am an environmentalist I like being able to save all those trees, too.At first I resisted the idea, thought I had to hold a book but then I looked at my overflowing bookselves (I'm a book collector) and thought maybe I better get the thing. So I did and I'm so glad. You will be, too. I reeally do believe it is like the best thing since the printing press. Thanks Steve Besos"
4,As an avid reader..,"..I go through books quite quickly. so i always had books all over the house! So when i got the Kindle as an anniversary gift, i was amazed @ the quality of the Kindle. i thought i would miss reading the traditional way, boy was I wrong!! I take the Kindle w/ me everywhere.Books are a breeze to purchase, just click & wait for it to download.would highly recommend.Cons: it's easy to hit next page button by mistake."
3,This is for the Amazon Kindle developers,"Great product but the price is a little off. As soon as you get it to 200 or so I will buy but man 400 bucks is quite a price when you can get a lot for that kind of money as far as technology goes. I have a Sony reader but I did the deal where I got it for like 150 or so.I just want you to know that yours seems to be a superior product but not at that price. If you dont get a deal from Sony then yours is better but I think both products are overpriced.I am excited by your entry into this market and will watch for a deal on this but till then I will limp along with my Sony, JK I like it but I wish it included a dictionary (GREAT THING FOR YOU TO INCLUDE!!!)."
4,Classic Ebook Public Library - Project Gutenberg,"There are plenty of reviews written about the Kindle, but one note I would like to make is there are free classic ebooks available at Project Gutenberg (just google it). For those who don't know, Project Gutenberg is a volunteer-run organization (non-profit) which transcribes those books for which the copyrights have expired into ebooks. I'm reading Moby Dick right now! Very cool.Anyway, the Kindle is absolutely wonderful, though a bit of an eyesore. I bought a Sony Reader last year, which is excellently designed and essentially a more attractive Kindle without all the cool wireless features (had I known this was going to come out I wouldn't have gotten one). In my opinion, go with the Kindle."
1,More useful ---,"When I buy a book I want to hold and keep it on my shelf when I am done. The model for this machine should be books as a service. That means charge a monthly fee for the downloading of books. Also open it up to the educational market. Let students ""rent"" their textbooks and let teachers send materials to the whole class. Too much of the cost of a book is in the printing, storing (inventory)and shipping of books. If these costs don't exist for an e-book let the consumer pay much less for an e-book. $10 is too much for a book."
4,LOVE my Kindle too,"Okay, so this review is totally not going to be technical, but I have to say that if you're looking for something lightweight, and easy on the eyes, and seemingly durable (though I've only had mine for less than a month), you want the Kindle. I am so glad I purchased this, even at the rather steep price, it's worth it."
4,Love the Kindle!,"My husband got me a Kindle for Christmas, and I have to say, I love it! I was a bit disappointed that the Whispernet service does not work at our house, even though we're close to a major city and do get cell service, etc. (hence, the four stars), but otherwise, it's been great.The Kindle certainly won't replace regular books for me -- I love the feel of a real book. But it is perfect for travel, or to keep in my purse for those times when I need some reading material: the dentist's office, car pool line, or a quick getaway to the coffee shop.I love that it can hold a ton of books, and that I can use an SD card if I need/want to hold even more. Right now, I'm testing out subscriptions to magazines and blogs; the free initial subscription period is fantastic!I also appreciate the fact that the Kindle Store carries a decent selection of kids' books. That means my 10-year-old can use my Kindle when we're traveling, too (provided he can talk me into giving it up for a while!)."
5,SEEING IS BELIEVING ...,"and I'm a believer! This is a marvelous device. I read my NY Times on it daily and find reading books on it delightful! I'm not having problems with the buttons or the cover; once you figure out the best way for you to pick it up and hold it, you're fine! I'm not a technie; nor do I usually adopt first-generation devices. I took the leap with the Kindle and I'm ecstatic about having done so. In fact, I've another ordered for a family member. This is a five-star device that comes with five-star customer service. Even more important than that - you'll love reading with it. Really. Go do it now ..... before I order another one and your wait is even longer. It's the real deal and then some."
5,One Word: Priceless!,"I am an avid reader and collector of hardback & paperback books. Fiction, non-fiction, biography, autobiography, history...and so on. I love opening the pages of a new book: the feel, the smell, the anticipation of losing myself in the story, etc.For these reasons, I was very surprised when my husband purchased the Kindle for me for mother's day. I admit, I didn't even know what it was! It sat in the box, unopened, until our summer trip to the beach. I was in no hurry to explore because I thought it went against my love of ""real"" books. Actually, I thought my husband really blew it.Boy, was I ever wrong!!! I absolutely love this product. I can download all types of books and periodicals. It is convenient and easy to use, the type can be adjusted, and the size is perfect. Kuddos Amazon!!"
1,A better choice!!!!,"This product is extremely over priced.I've used it for reading 5 books before I bought an Ipod touch... Let's take a moment to compare what you can buy with that amount of money....You could purchase a brand new Ipod touch. With that you could listen to music, audio books, watch movies/tv shows as well as view web pages and get up to date news/weather, but you want to read E books, you need an E book player right? Well guess what.....The Ipod touch does that as well and works great!!!Oh, btw, it has wifi too and the only time you really have to plug it into a computer is when your charging it. That is unless your using a wall socket or cig lighter to charge....For the money I would get the product thats prooven to make people happy as well as meet all needs and beyond. Hope this review helps....."
5,I LOVE THIS!!,"I was a little skeptical about spending 350.00 on a ""book"", but I'm so glad I did. My decision was made because I was gonig on vacation & know I usually read about 4 books in a week (on vacation) & with the airline luggage restrictions this seemed ideal. I took it to Hawaii, but put it in a large ziploc while at the beach (sand worries) and to the pool, golf course, etc. I had NO problems at all. In fact I wasn't into a book I had purchased & was so happy at the ease of getting a new one on the spot. I did have a little trouble at the airport in Maui, they checked it like 4 times in the x-ray, but I was told to treat it like a computer & leave it out it should be fine (it was in my purse). Other than that this Kindle is great for me!! I have recommeded it to all my friends that read."
5,Everyone should have one,The Kindle is an awesome product. It is light weight and easy to use. I can download my reading from anywhere and never lose my spot (like I do with book marks). I highly recommend this product.
3,Needs just a little improvement,"The key to change pages is too ""soft"" and can easily be pressed accidentally, changing too many pages. It needs to have a little ""click"" and be a little stiffer. The same goes for the back page button. The forward page button is too large and sometimes it is pressed when just trying to hold the Kindle. The whole concept of an e-book is very good and took a long time in coming. My wife and I have been looking for something like this since the early 1990's. You should also offer a ""package"" of very many classical ""books"" (i.e. books that are already in the public domain - Mark Twain, Charles Dickens, Ancient Rome and Greek authors, etc.) as part of the package either with the Kindle or with the extra memory chips, but Leaving enough room for the newer stuff.Respectfully submitted,Arthur Herbruger"
4,Kindle,"This is the most amazing product for someone with vision problems. Having macular degeneration, it is difficult for me to read small print. By enlarging the font I have been able to read the New York Times daily and the books I have selected. Furthermore it is easy to read in the sunlight which is very important to me. My only criticism is that it is too easy to accidentally touch buttons and change the page and then it can be a nuisance to go back to what I was reading. Also the case the Kindle comes in is worthless. You need to design something more functional."
3,great - for travellers,"I ordered this as a gift for my husband who commutes daily AND travels a bit. I figured he could have a couple of books ""going"" and also get the news etc. He wasn't interested. Selfishly, I thought I'd keep it and give it a whirl. It's definitely cool, but cool doesn't justify me keeping it as I don't commute or travel much. I can get my news fix online, and I can stack my books next to my bed. My only legitimate complaint, however, is that you cannot reference page numbers. i.e., if you are discussing a book and someone says, ""In chapter two (or on page 72), it said . . . "" you can't easily get there. I returned it. When the price comes down significantly, perhaps I'll reconsider for the convenience."
5,I love my Kindle,"I have read over a dozen books since getting my kindle in the beginning of February. I love it!! I agree with other readers that the next page buton is too large and it's easy to hit it by accident. I think that you should add a light or brighten button so you can read it in low light areas and maybe add a little book rest in the back so you can position upwards when reading and this may reduce the number of accidental page forwards when reading lying down.I did try one two week subscription to the globe and it was ok but did not include everything in the paper.I love being able to access the web and hope you keep this feature-it is a little bit difficult to manuever around email etc. but I'm sure the finished application will be great!!! Finally, I wish I was able to use gift certificates when purchasing material instead of it going directly to my credit card."
4,Very convenient and enjoyable to use.,"I have had my Kindle for over a month now and believe it is one of the most convenient devices I have ever used. Downloading reading material, books and newspapers, has been a snap.The screen is easy on the eyes and overall I am happy with the device.The battery life is not quite as long as advertised - but still works well enough to spend a day travelling and reading without worrying about power."
4,Serious Readers,"I love my Kindle, mainly for the convenience of purchasing a new book within seconds....I'm a very fast reader and am always needing another book to read. The price seems rather high, but we have to pay for what we want, I guess. The ""back button"" on the bottom right is annoying because I accidently press it often and it takes me back to home rather than back a page...but all in all I am thrilled to have my Kindle. The Oprah discount was very appreciated!"
4,My travel buddy,I just finished on a 5 day trip with my Kindle. I was able to turn it on whenever I wanted to read a few lines. It is lightweight and I could read even in dim light. Definitely a great companion on a long car ride.I love it.
1,A Lemon,"I found that there were many other complaints that looked just like mine. After a little more than a year, the Kindle froze. This should not happen to a product that cost $185, as mine did. At the least, Kindle should replace this defective product. With all the advertising they do, surely they can afford to ensure customer good will."
5,Kindle,Easy to use. Wonderful for those who have vision problems with many print selections. Lightweight. Nearly unlimited choices of reading material.
3,"Like it, but...","This little ""book"" is a great idea. I like it for traveling and like that I can download pretty much any book on the current book lists. The only thing is that it doesn't have a light and that is annoying. I can't seem to fit any booklight onto it. Overall, I'd give it a 4 * but because of the light thing, I'm giving it a 3 *."
5,What is not to like?,I am a huge Amazon electronics junkie. This is a well thought out product. I cannot imagine what future versions of the Kindle will deliver. Buy it now!
4,Kindle Review,"Overall, this is a very good product. Most of the frustration of this product is getting your fingers used to where the buttons are. To often in the early use of the product, would end up depressing the next page button which would move you forward whether you were ready or not. Once I made adjustments to this, the enjoyment this product offers just stands out. Loading an inexpensive SD card (make certain to read what the product can handle so you don't buy to large of a card)gives you an almost limitless amount of books to you can store.Pictures on the product are so-so. Wish the magazine offered had the pictures available to view. Also hope more magazines become available like the newspapers are.The wireless network is exceptional. Books are downloaded almost instantly. Looking forward to the library expanding"
4,great with unrealized potential,"I've had the Kindle for about 6 months now. At the beginning I went wild buying books, obtaining free books, and putting articles on the device. For going on vacation it is absolutely unbeatable because you can have an infinite amount of reading material in a small package. After a while though, I wanted to read various books that weren't available for the Kindle (William Manchester's the Last Lion about Churchill, Calvin Tomkin's Off the Wall about Rauchenberg, Dean Wareham's Black Postcards) and that's the problem -- you don't want to be a slave to bestsellers. I'm aware that Amazon is constantly adding to the titles available but I wonder whether they're working at digitizing non-best sellers, perhaps it's not cost effective for them. So I'd say the Kindle is not a ""total solution"" but it is very useful."
2,Are you kidding me?,"I have been reading ebooks for years on various Palm products, where there are numerous sources for obtaining reading material. As well, I also have the utility of a Palm Pilot. Currently I read books which I download FREE from the public library. It is amazing that anyone would want to pay this kind of money for a dedicated system, which has only one source for material."
5,Kindle,"I love my new Kindle. It was very easy to set up, learn a few functions, order a book in under a minute and start reading. I love it!!"
3,Keyboard,"I have had my Kindle for 9 months. Most of the letters on the keyboard are disappearing. I called Amazon and was told they would replace my Kindle with one that a customer was sent and decided they did not want. They said they could not give me a new one because mine was 9 months old. So that means to me anyway, that the one they send me would not be new and was one someone sent back to them for some reason. How can the letters be disappearing in 9 months. If I was not a typist and would not be able to know where the letters were. Amazon/Kindle please check this out. I am now purchasing the Nook and will never buy a Kindle again."
4,Love my Kindle,I recently got my first Kindle and love it! There have been some side effects though.Blue circles under my eyesWith naked truth it belies;That restful sleep is dwindledFor love of reading kindled.
2,Not ready for marketplace,I tried to buy a popular book (Elements of Style) and it was not available. Next I tried to buy a popular author (Neal Asher) and he was not available. I tried to buy a newspaper and it froze up so badly I had to remove the battery to get it to reboot.The above is my fist 5 minutes of experience with the Kindle.Jim
3,Keyboard disappearing,"When I first received my Kindle as a gift from my son, I was already reading a regular paper book, so I decided to download some crosswords and every word games. I have found from continuously using the keys the letters are disappearing. This started almost immediately, say within a 30 day period. I do not use it all day, as I work, so I mostly play these games in the evening or on weekends.I'm really disappointed that they didn't make the keyboard letters as durable as you have on a computer keybord, which do not disappear with use.I've only had the kindle since this past Christmas, so if there is a warrantly on it, I definitely would like to replace the keyboard -- hopefully, with more durable letters."
4,For The Lover Of Words,"If you are a book-lover. Or one who will read almost anything...Well, the Kindle is for you.PLUS:*Very easy on the eyes. You'll be pleasantly surprised.*Reading the Kindle while using book cover...I find...almost eliminates any problems with accidental paging.*The dictionary feature is awesome.*Downloading books, etc. is quick and simple.*Internet access is a nice plus...though nothing is ever fast enough.*Wikipedia...very cool.*You'll love the ""Sample before you buy"" feature.*You don't have to own a computer. Or know how to use one!MINUS:ON/OFF switch is in awkward place.Reset button...(have not had the need to use it)...is inconvenient.If you love having easy access to all types of reading material and more...the Kindle is the ticket. Good stuff!"
4,Love my Kindle!,"The Kindle performs as advertised! I love being able to download books (and especially samples of books) on the fly. No more carting around hardback or paperback books. And, I can increase the font size so that I don't need to wear my reading glasses! Works great.I'd like to see more blogs that I can get access to, and especially free blogs. I don't see the point of paying to get blogs, especially the limited number that are there."
4,Love the Kindle!,"I love the Kindle. So much more comfortable than a paper book, and, as a conservationist, appreciate a paperless world, partly anyway. I live in an area where travel is sometimes restricted due to weather, so, being able to conjure up a new read without leaving my chair is a wonderful thing. I am learning to close the cover before moving the kindle, so as to avoid accidentally turning a page. Future models might consider smaller ""turn"" button on the right side to allow for more room to handle the kindle by the edges."
5,The beggining of a new generation of technology!,"I, in fact happen to own an Amazon kindle. On Tuesday, I bought a book and started reading it. I was very impressed on this new 'ebook'.The price: At first, you might say,"" $400??!! Im not paying that much for the kindle!""But just consider, in a year, you will probably have bought about 20 books or more. Say each book is about $15. You would have spent about $300 on books in a year. The Amazon kindle can store 200 books at a time! Can you carry 200 books on an air plane or train? Now you can! Imagine: your whole library traveling with you.The Amazon kindle is definitely worth the money!"
2,Amazon does not separate fiction from nonfiction,"I am spending inordinate amounts of time trying to figure out which books are nonfiction. This is tedious and leaves me with less time to read. I have complained about this repeatedly to Amazon with no results. Also keep in mind that the Kindle is fragile and the case does not securely hold and protect the fragile Kindle. At the same time the case provides a false sense of security. You think the case is holding your Kindle. I picked my Kindle up, it slid out of the case, and fell on the floor. It only dropped once about four feet and now it is worthless. Kindle support advises it will cost $180.00 to repair. I am retired and watched my Kindle like a hawk. I am also a registered nurse accustomed to handling costly devices. Customer Support was excellent. They answered my phone call promptly and professionally. I strongly advise using VELCRO to attach your Kindle to the case. Now that I own a Kindle I hope never to be without one. I like it!"
5,surprise,"Kindle: Amazon's New Wireless Reading DeviceAmazingly easy to use, love the ability to change type size. I am a senior citizen with problem with my hands so I would like to be able to disconnect the righthand page buttons but am learning to live with that minor inconvience. Have recommende this to many people--love it."
1,What a missed opportunity,"Sony's eReader is much better than Kindle. What a missed opportunity for Amazon and Sony. What a great combination it could have been, Sony's superior technology with Amazon's selection of books."
2,another object to carry,I would rather download them to my iphone or pay to read them on an online web app. Can't carry anymore things.
2,Looks like my old fax machine!,"For the past few years there have been several attempts at a decent electronic book reader. I don't think we're quite there yet. In the year of the iPhone (sleek and beautiful), why have they come out with something so utterly ugly?I imagined something like a screen (just a little larger than this one) with all the commands available in a tactile interface (à la Apple). Eventually I would love an electronic book reader, but I would be embarrassed to take this thing out of my bag. We're getting closer though..."
3,Kindle,"I love this product and enjoy looking up words I do not know, previewing books, etc. However, I notice there is a black line being burned into the screen and graphics come in blurry. Mr. Bezos give us color too! This has so much more potential to be amazing but for now it is great."
1,Sounds Great...BUT,"Gosh, Kindle sounds great, something I would definetly indulge in even considering some of the discussed drawbacks IF it were realistically priced. Good lord, for $400 I can buy alot of paperbacks-even including shipping ;) Nice idea Amazon, now run with it, show consumer support and make it something folks can actually afford."
5,Kindle Rocks!,Kindle: Amazon's New Wireless Reading DeviceThis is just what the doctor ordered. I travel 3-4 days a week and do not always have time to stop at a Bookstore. I love to read and the immediate fulfillment. I get from the kindle's whispernet connection is perfect. I always have have new material. Instantly! It is easy to see. I love listening to background music on it as well. Best purchase I have made in a long time well worth the price.DAnny
5,Love the Kindle!!,I love the Kindle - I had a prior E-book reader and it was limited in the books I could purchase for it - with the Kindle there is more choices through Amazon than any other E-book Reader I have looked at in recent years. My only complaint is transferring prior e-book purchases to the Kindle - wish the process was easier. All in All I love the Kindle for the fact I can take it with me wherever I travel and have all the books I love at my fingertips or if a new release comes out and it's available on Kindle I can be reading it in under a minute. Since I'm and avid reader this option works best for me. If you love to read - the Kindle is the device for you!!!
1,Limited Books on Kindle,"Returned the product when discovered that the Harry Potter series is not available for Kindle. If that's not available, then the selection is pretty darn limited."
2,Product needs work. Very disappointed.,"I was very excited the first time I booted up my Kindle. That excitement has been short lived.Over two consecutive days I purchased books that did not download. Over the first day this occurred to a newspaper subscription that also did not download.After wading through too many pages to discover a link to support, I finally succeeded in creating and sending an email to support. I have yet to hear from anyone.The hardware itself looks great but also needs work. Application buttons run into the sides of the unit, and upon picking up the unit, almost always end up accidentally prompting an application.Had I received a prompt response from Amazon, I would have held off on this review.Kindle has potential but needs work.Mr. Bezos, you have let down your loyal consumers. Buyer beware."
5,What a wonderful invention...,"I've recently been having some eye problems--and the thing I grieved most was how it limited my reading ability. I ordered the Kindle because it would let me boost the type size so easily, and that has been a great help. The eye is much better now, but I'm hooked on all the amazing ways in which the Kindle has changed my reading and book-buying habits. I don't have a negative word to say. Love it! It truly is a wonderful invention and I'm grateful for it."
1,Can Not Use In Canada,"After purchasing this product and before I actually even received it in the mail I received an e-mail stating that I required a US billing address and US Bank issued credit card in order to purchase any of the reading materials. This was not stated clearly on the website. It allowed me to purchase it using a Canadian billing address and Candadian Bank issued credit card, with no warning stating I could not download any products onto it without valid US infomation. I had to pay for the return shipping on a product I couldn't even use. This information should be stated on the main page of the Kindle website and not buried at the bottom of the FAQ list. A warning should also pop up if you attempt to purchase it with an out of country credit card and billing address."
2,It isn't all it works out to be,"For all the hype Kindle created I couldn't stop myself from buying it. I was so excited I couldn't wait till I received it. But once I did get it, it wasn't all that I thought it would be. For starters you can't use it outside of the US which has not been mentioned anywhere in all the fine print. What happens to people who live outside of the US are they not allowed to have the same luxuries and privileges as those in the US. OK so the wispernet doesn't work outside of the US but we can still download books from Amazon via the USB cable, right, wrong. The only way you can buy is if you have a US credit card, which is really the pits. So for all the hype that Amazon has created about the Kindle, it doesn't deliver."
1,D.O.A.,"Without backlighting, this product is MORE dead than the Sony e-Book. (Which is already a dismal failure.) Too bad. There is a market. but this device will never find it.Question: How many book lights are sold to enable reading in bed, on an airplane, or on the subway? Do you now expect the user to carry a book light too?Shame on you Amazon. I onvce thought that you were in touch with your market.Unfortunaltely, other developers will likely miss the core problem of this and the Sony device. All e-books may die due to the arrogance of designers who have never used the media. This is a great disservice to the technologuy. Amazon, you deserve to be embarrassed."
1,Awful Product!!,"This thing is a ridiculous ripoff! It's screen continually froze on me. I have an army of twisted paper clips scattered on my bedside table, my bag, and my desk that I used to constantly reset it. In addition, when it did decide to work, I would press a button and then have to wait and wait for it to respond--if at all. Each time I attempted to use the Kindle, it was hit or miss if it would just be incredibly slow or completely freeze after 2 minutes. I contacted Customer service twice and was given poor advice both times.I would not recommend this product at all! Just read the newspaper on line and pick up a paperback or listen on your MP3 player. The Kindle needed much more testing before it was released on the unsuspecting consumer! So disappointing!"
2,Kindle,"I bought the Kindle as a gift for my husband. He loved the idea of it; but in the end we returned it because of the flashing light when going from page to page. He is a fast and avid reader, which meant he was constantly bombarded by the flashing light."
5,Lil's view,"I love my Kindle. I live in a rural area and read a lot. Getting to a library, book store, or waiting for the UPS truck meant I was out of reading material far too often. With my Kindle, I am only 1 click and 30 seconds away from a new book. I can get a new book down loaded from my laptop when I am at home where I have no cell service or I can be sitting on top of a mountain far from home and get a book wirelessly. Wow! The Kindle is easy to use even for an old lady who is not so computer smart. And I love the screen which reads like a real paper book. In fact, I get so lost in my book at times that I reach for the corner to turn a page!I took my Kindle to jury duty recently and could have sold ten more if I would have had them in my bag. Now that I have one, my Kindle goes with me everywhere I go."
3,"There are so many things I love about Kindle, but...","I love shopping for books online and having them delivered immediately to my Kindle. I love saving trees by reading books on Kindle instead of on paper. I think that the built-in dictionary is an inspired touch. I find Kindle easy to use and easy to read.BUT...I find it mildly annoying that there are a fair number of typos in Kindle texts: hyphens and carriage returns where they don't belong appear a little too frequently.I find it EXTREMELY annoying that so many of the books I want aren't available in Kindle format! Being able to get books immediately, at the touch of a key, was one of the main things that attracted me to Kindle, but if the book isn't available in Kindle format, it doesn't matter how many keys you touch.Kindle is a fantastic idea, but if you're an avid reader, I suggest you spend some time browsing Kindle titles to be sure that you'll be able to get your favorite authors and subjects."
3,Needs Design Change,"I borrowed one from a friend to try it out. Loved everything except the physical design. The case needs to be designed to be held higher up the sides. The paging buttons can be much smaller (closer to the top) with only one on each side - ""next page"" on right and ""previous page"" on left. If the hands are wrapped around the sides, the thumb can be used easily for paging. I would love to have one, but will not buy unless and until it is more comfortable to hold for a long period. I was impressed with the download speed and accessibility. We are in a rugged mountain area where ordinary cell phone coverage is spotty."
3,Needs a larger font,"I bought the Kindle for my wife who has macular degeneration. What a great idea, books in a small package at a very reasonable price that one can take with where ever you want to go.Unfortunately, the largest font size is still too small for sight impared people.If it becomes possible to add a larger font, I'll try it again. As is, I had to return it."
3,Needs more features,"Kindle is a great idea but it needs a few more features to make it really fantastic. First, a lot more titles. Kindle seems like it could be a good way to make a lot of hard to find, out of print books available again. Second, a feature that would allow syncing of unabridged audio books with their ""printed"" versions. Imagine starting a book on your drive home, then picking up exactly where you left off from your favorite reading chair."
4,Great V1 product,"I just received my Kindle this afternoon and was using it within minutes. The device is very intuitive and no setup was required. Two books and today's copy of the New York Times were downloaded within minutes. The screen is easy to read even in direct sun. With the ability to bookmark, annotate, clip content and search all the content, I can't imagine why anyone would still prefer physical books, magazines, and newspapers. I'd rather save a tree and reduce the clutter on my desk. The carry case is a little klunky, but I'm sure after-market cases will show up soon. A color screen would also be nice for some pictures and graphics but is not really necessary for a print reader."
2,Still a little Pricey $$$,"Cool idea, and perhaps someday this will be the only way to read a book, but that day might be 30 years away...One problem is that it started out far more expensive than the comparable Sony competitor. Now with the price break, the Kindle is still about $60 more than the Sony PRS-505, which in itself is a very decent product (Sony is a tough competitor).Then there is the general issue that for $360, you can likely buy about fifty paperbacks, or more if you buy used, so it takes quite a while for this thing to pay itself back."
5,"You win some, you lose some",I ordered three books. I got two out of three but paid for three out of three. I get nice emails claiming that Amazon wants to be responsive but when I reply the email address is for outgoing messages only. Where is my stuff?
3,Great Gadget!,"I love my Kindle, it's great. The only improvments that would make it better are color and a light, so I could get rid of the little reading light that I have to attach to it. Besides my iphone, I use it all the time!!"
4,Lovin' my new Kindle,"I am really enjoying my Kindle. I really love the page turn tabs on both sides, it fits comfortably in my hand, the cursor is easy to use and best of all I only have to take one book when I travel - a huge, huge space saver and benefit.Some thoughts for the future: After you have downloaded a book, there doesn't seem to be a way to get the summary of it from your home screen. I got a little carried away after I bought it and downloaded about 20 books. But after a few weeks I couldn't recall what they were all about. Also, I have hit the back tab a few times, unintentionally, and it took me to a contents page. This button could perhaps be located somewhere where you are less likely to tab accidentally. And I still prefer the sleek look of the Sony reader, but my Kindle wins out over all. Thanks"
3,"Not that ""Handy""","I don't think the Kindle is as easy to handle as I expected. It is very hard to hold it without accidently turning the page. The ON/OFF switch is on the back and you have to reach between the cover and Kindle to get to it...very awkward...and usually, a page is accidently turned while you do it. Also, be aware that there is no ""back"" lighting in the unit , so, don't expect to read in places without good lighting. I am not thrilled with my purchase."
1,Fragile screen,"I was so excited to get my Kindle. I loved every part of it. After less than 1 month I reached for it in my purse to show a friend and found the screen damaged. The Kindle was in it's case and the case shows no sign of damage. I have no idea what happened to it. The tech support guy said that he's heard that someone's cat sat on their Kindle and ruined the screen. There is no repair for it, only a replacment for $180.00. I told him that I had just paid $350 to use it for less than a month, why would I want to spend another $180 to get another one that will be damaged. He said that maybe if I spent the $180 on a replacement I would be more careful next time. Wow! Now I'm just stuck with a $350 useless reminder that I wasted my money. I am VERY UNHAPPY."
3,It's all about the pricing...recurring charges...,"The price of the Kindle is average for this type of device. My concern is about the recurring charges like potential connection fees. Also the price of the books ""seems"" reasonable until you consider the fact that your paying for a single viewing - you cannot share the book without sharing your Kindle. If you buy a book, you can pass it around to potentially hundreds of people making the investment much easier. $10 for one reading of a book is much harder to justify for me."
2,Kindle fun but frivilous,"I like it because I like new techie gadgets, not because it is changing my life in any appreciable manner.I cannot give the book to a friend as I do with real books. I cannot borrow a book from the library other than download an audio book which is not the same as an e-book.It gives you capabilities outside of reading but I already have devices that can do these other tasks or entertainment functions.Kindle is an electronic device that will hold many books within one piece of equipment, but that really only comes in handy if I were to be incapable of getting more books or was traveling and thus did not want to carry more than ""1"" book.Another techie toy, high price, and offers other features that I already possess on my other techie device.It is fun if you have the funds to throw about though impractical."
4,Early disappointment,"Had a Kindle shipped to me immediately before leaving on a 4 week vacation overseas. Also ordered two books at the same time.Product arrived on time and I packed it in my briefcase, looking forward to reading while away.Discovered that I had to register to get my books downloaded, and I was unable to do so in Athens, any of the stops on a cruise in the Greek Isles or Turkey, Nairobi, Tanzania, Kampala or London.It finally worked in Amsterdam on my way home.I love it, but it was a real disappointing start.Thanks."
1,Now I know what Palm did w/ all their Foleos...gave them to Amazon,"I agree w/ all the 1 and 2 star reviews given. How a company can release a product that is so UGLY in the year 2007 is beyond me; and it took 3 years? Why didn't anyone on the design team say anything?I'm mostly mad because of my disappointment in Amazon. If the product was designed well and supported open formats, I would buy it in a heart-beat. I've been looking for a decent ebook reader for years - how many reviews have given the other crops of ebook readers bad marks for having no backlight support - the only time a lot of us have time to read is in the evenings after our kids are put to bed (why don't people get this? duh!).All the other features are killer - but my points above are a non-starter for me. I'll keep waiting. In the mean time, I'll continue to read ebooks on my Palm T|X. You can even pick up a cheap used tablet pc for less on ebay or craigslist."
3,Not for Macular D or limited vision,"I bought the Kindle for my parents. Mom has Macular Degeneration and Dad's eyes did not return to full vision following detached retinas. I thought the large print feature would be good for them and give them more flexibility in book choices than searching for large print at the library.Unfortunately, they are barely able to use the thing. They can only turn it on/off and turn pages because they memorized the placements. The large print feature is a stand-alone amid nothing else large. They cannot read the menus, see the book reviews, order books, or know what the buttons are for. They're afraid to touch the buttons in case they get a screen they can't see and then can't get the book back.This is a pretty cool little gadget for those who like gadgets and who have tech savvy and great vision. Don't buy it if you are thinking it will be useful for those with limited vision."
5,Kindle an effective new tool for readers,"When I first heard fo the Kndle, I was sceptical. I have been a teacher of English Literature for over forty years and wqas dragged kicking and screaming inte the age of electronic sholarship.However, the possibilities for Kindle based reading became quickly obvious to me When I traveled, I used to take a small library with me. Now Kindle carries most (but not yet all) of what I need to work while I am abroad. I love the note taking features and since I teach classes on line, I hope to download and organize my notes for my classes, which will make posting in classes much easier.I also conduct a reading group and the note taking features will help me navigate the text during discussions.At home, I am running out of space, so the Kindle alternative is also welcome there.I am thorougly enjoying this product."
1,Great Machine????,"Great machine!! When I ordered it they said I had coverage, Montana, when my wife started her Christmas gift message says no coverage. All is not lost right? She tries to download through her computer but will not transfer to her Kindle. After many service calls they say send it back and she will bet a new one. Why if they have limited wireless areas does it not work with the computer?? Very dissatisfied"
2,suggestions for improvements,"I have been trying to get information on this as a reading aid for an elderly person, but it appears that for those who are not comfortable with technology, there are many elements of the Kindle that could be improved. I would suggest larger buttons for people to see and manage without accidentally hitting something else. Small buttons are hard to operate for those with reading difficulties."
3,Great item...too expensive - for now,"This is a great concept and will take off. It's like having a bookstore in your hand! But, until the price comes down, only hardcore readers are going to pick one up.What I don't understand is why Bezos didn't put out a basic, stripped down version for a more affordable price.The wireless features are pretty cool, but I could just as easily USB sync from my PC. I personally don't need to write on the screen or highlight text. If there were a $200 - $299 version with an absolute basic feature set, I think a lot more people would buy one.Of course, in about a year, that will probably be the price for this model. I'll wait."
5,A Perfect Fit,"I love my Kindle. Here's why:- In the rural area I live in, being able to have a major newspaper, such as the Washington Post, delivered directly into my hands every morning is a feat never before accomplished. Until I got my Kindle, that is.- It fits in my purse. And I have a very small purse. So I can just whip it out whenever I have time to kill: at the doctor's office, on my lunch break, getting my oil changed, etc.- No monthly fees. That's bloody amazing.- All those new releases that are only available in expensive hardcover? Cheaper on my Kindle! Heckuva lot easier to carry around, too.- Whatever book I want to read is instantly available. I no longer have to hunt a title down at the local bookstore, only to find that they don't have it and it'll take five days to order it.Does the Kindle check my email, let me read PDF business documents, or maintain a contacts list? No. The Kindle was designed for you to READ. Not to be your Blackberry."
4,Ya. It's Really Good,"Bottom Line: If you like to read, and if you like to make your acquisition of reading materials hassle-free, and if you are the kind of person who gets turned on by an ideas and wants to pursue them....buy this.Ya, it's a first generation. It's going to get way better over the next few months and years. But for someone who likes to read, get books easily, and loves pursuing ideas, there is NOTHING else right now that even comes close to Kindle in the known universe. What universe are you waiting for?"
5,I Fell In Love,"I have had my Kindle for almost a month now. I have only order two books so far since I had some ""normal books"" still to finish up and send to my sister but I have fallen in love with my Kindle. It is so convenient to use and the books download so quickly. I will be buying only electronic books from now on and have recommended it to everyone I know that enjoys reading as much as I do."
5,Great,The Kindle is just the best. I read alot and now I can just carry one thing around when I travel and leave the 2 shopping bags of books home. This is as easy as using a cell pone.
4,What I want the Kindle to carry.,I want my state and national newspapers to be carried on a Kindle. I want to be able to print ads and coupons.I want paper catalogs to go away. I don't want to shop from the Kindle and I don't want to browse on a computer. I want to browse on the Kindle.I want to buy any book that I once read and have fond memories of.This is what a Kindle is good for.
5,Remarkable-JUST remarkable!,"I've been following the Kindle product for awhile now and, to my surprise, my wife purchased me one about a week ago. In just this short time of ownership, I can advise anyone who is considering purchasing this device that they can do so with confidence. Both the device AND the support for it from Amazon is state of the art and like no other E-reader or electronic book retrieval source available. I can't stress enough that not only will you find EVERYTHING about the device outstanding, but will also be impressed with the speed in downloading and accessing material for it as well! The types of services that Amazon supports this device with and the pricing for them are also remarkable. This device shines!"
3,Why not include a text-reader function?,"For the people who have difficulty reading, or low vision, why not include a text-reader function like ""text-aloud"" - you would expand the market considerably."
5,Love My Kindle,I just love this device.To have the capability of reading without always having to put on my glasses is great. To be able to really carry a library with you to read whenever you want is just amazing!I just have to get use to packing it with me all the time.I forget it on the table and I am out waiting somewhere and realize I forgot it I get annoyed with myself!It is really great!An indulgent worth it for people who want a book or just good reading material of their own interest at their finger tips.
3,"figures and illustrations are not resizable, and text inside figures is often too small to read","After 12 hours reading with Kindle, I have one major complaint. Kindle does not allow you to zoom in and read the text in illustrations.Kindle always displays full page illustrations in their entirety on its tiny screen. Text inside the illustrations becomes so small that it cannot be read. Sometimes it nearly disappears.The regular text resizing options don't apply to text in images.For example, look at the figures in the sample chapter of this book:Amit Singh, Mac OS X Internals -- A Systems ApproachThis book presents much important information in figures and illustrations, and on the Kindle that information is inaccessible. I challenge anyone to read the text in Figures 2-14 and 2-15, with or without a microscope.I see this problem in several other books, primarily on subjects in computer science and mathematics."
3,I loved it till it froze,"I loved my 3G keyboard kindle and used it everyday for two years. One day it froze and I was disappointed to learn that once you try everything kindle support tells you to try to get it going... If it doesn't work there are no options but to buy another kindle! I thought that maybe it could get it sent in to be fixed....no! That is not an option. I wish that I had either got an extended warranty , or just stuck with buying regular books. With regular books, you can take them to a used book store and get more books. Now that I have spent literally hundreds of dollars on books, I now don't have the kindle or the books to read. They do remain in cyber space until I decide if I want to get another kindle. I just find it hard to believe that in this day and age, it can't be fixed. But that's it folks. Something to think about before you invest in the kindle experience."
5,Best thing ever,Best invention since the printing press. Easy on the eyes easy to read and use. Great in the car or airport.
1,ki ndle,I loaded 5 books to give to my son for christmas- went to wrap it and it didnt work but since it worked when I got it I dont think I can return it
1,not connecting to the wispernet,"My husband purchased his kindle several months ago and really loves it, so I recently ordered one for myself. The first one I received never worked properly, and after a couple of hours on the phone, I was told to return it, which I did. Another one was received in about 5 days, an at first it worked quite well. However, today I tried to order a book from kindle, and was not able to connect. After many attempts, I called the kindle department and spent more time on the phone trying several things. Nothing worked, and now I am waiting a few more days for someone to get back to me to resolve my problem,. My husband's kindle is sitting right next to mine and is having no problem connecting, so it's not the location. Even when bars are showing on the bottom, I still can't connect. I think that I will probably have to return this one as well, and I will not order another."
1,Why?,"The one star isn't for the Kindle, it's to Amazon for not forseeing the upcoming sales demand during the holidays. Didn't they learn from last year? You had to wait several months before the Kindle became available again! Now, it's not even December, and they're sold out. They should stop advertising something they cannot offer. It's not fair. I wanted to get this as a gift for Christmas, but I refuse to pay three times as much, which is what it's selling for on Ebay. I had to look for something else. I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way."
2,Formats Anyone?,"I haven't been able to locate - other than the information on visual media - what formats this reads. In other words, it looks as if I can't go to an epublisher and purchase a book from them and expect to be able to download and read on this device. That makes it impractical in today's expanding ebook market. Unless of course the publisher joins the Kindle store. Limited formats and where I can purchase books are the major reasons I disliked my Palm Pilot for this function. As an ebook author, I want readers to be able to seek and find those titles that are not on the NYTBS list and available only through the publisher. There are some real gems out there that might be missed. If I'm spending four hundred dollars on a device, I want to be able to read from any publisher, not just a select few."
4,A view on the Kindle from England,I purchased the Kindle after seeing the product being used by many people whilst I have been working and travelling in the US. Everyone said good things about the Kindle and the reality is that the product is better than I ever imagined. I purchased the product not fully realising that it is a product designed only for US residents (due to wireless connection) but thanks to the superb technical guidence I was given by the Support Team in Amazon I have made purchases and can use the product fully (with the exception of the wireless downloads but this will come to the UK eventually). The Kindle experience is a great one and one I recommend.Keith H V Hill (England)
5,Amazimg,My Kindle is amazing and wonderful. I always have reading material waiting for me. Visiting my Son last week he added a copy of the Word of God to my Kindle. How beneficial that is. Thank you for developing this wonderful device.
4,I love my Kindle. The best money I ever spent,"I am used to the side buttons that are easily pushed and think the Kindle is the greatest thing since the birth of my daughter. Really. I wouldn't take my money back for mine and in fact, wouldn't sell it to buy another. I am attached. I live in Venice Florida and take it to the beach two to three times a week and spend the afternoon reading. My husband works crossword puzzles but I think my Kindle is lots more fun.There is only one thing I wish the designers had put on this cherished product and that is a light so that I could read in the dark while my husband sleeps. That would be the frosting on the cake. Is there anyway the designers might consider building them with a lighted screem that lights up in the dark.........Wow, that would be the bestJan Bujwit"
5,GET ONE!,"The product is great the service is awesome, and it keeps getting better for what it does it's the bomb."
2,Ugly with potential,"Why is this book so ugly. I especially don't like the keyboards sticking out. I think I have been spoilt with iphone and the likes.I prefer sony's ebook design to Kindle, but kindle's library more. But, please do justice to everybody and pay some designer to play around with Kindle. I am sure Amazon.com can afford it."
1,This device gave me migraines.,I tried reading a book with this device and I found that approximately 30 pages in I had severe migraines. I have never had this problem with a real book. Hopefully I can return it for a refund.
2,Highlighting?,"Books are tools for me and each one I use is highlighted to the max. What a great tool if lines/words could be highlighted and, then, pulled up later in search mode. I bet it will happen. Till then, I have to give it 2 stars for effort...unless it already has that capability."
2,"The Kindle is a ""Premie""","It is cumbersome to use and needs some upgrades. My wife test ed it, read several reviews, and will waith for improvement before ordering again. We returned the original Kindle."
4,Need more magazines and newspapers available!,"The ""Kindle is great for downloading books, but there aren't enough magazines and newspapers available. I like to read everything. I hope they get more soon, since I've made this investment!"
3,Kindle for my college bound nephew,"I recently bought the Kindle for my nephew, who just graduated high school and is on his way to college in the fall. I did so in the hopes that text book publishers will eventually make their books available for the Kindle. Perhaps this is a pipe dream, but it would help cut down the cost of going to college if they did. But even if they don't, it should still save him money on non-text books that may be required reading in some classes.Since I haven't used it, I can't really rate it. But I'm forced to, to publish this review, so I gave it three stars. I did so because I saw it when my nephew turned it on for the first time, and it did live up to the claims that it is a close second to real paper. If text books become available on the Kindle, I would up grade my rating, as I may if I get one of my own."
2,"Nice, but needs work on the battery",Bought it in June and the battery already can't hold a charge. Have not used in much and was out for the month of August. Amazon needs to address this issue. You need to buy extra batteries if you want to use on the go. If you use it by an outlet it is good.
3,Roger's Review,"Kindle is a start. The concept is viable, but improvements must be made. The major improvement needed is a better arrangement of controls so that handling the device doesn't result in page changes. Access to the on-off switches should be more accessible. The Alt aA sleep/wake feature could be eliminated if the on-off switch were relocated to the front or an edge. The holder/cover does not adequately secure the Kindle to prevent it from falling out. In spite of the fore-mentioned inadequacies, I like the Kindle and hope that it becomes a commercial success. I would recommend a mechanism that would permit an owner to suggest new Kindle acquisitions: books, magazines and newspapers. Sampling this information should provide Amazon with priorities for future additions that would sell. For example, I would like to subscribe to the New Yorker on Kindle."
2,Over priced for what you get,I just don't get why this is so expensive. I have a 3G iPhone with a FREE eReader app called Stanza. I can read the exact same books that the Kindle does plus all the other features of 3rd party apps including PDF support.If Amazon really wanted to sell this thing they'd subsidize the cost and create a membership package to a virtual book club. 99 bucks for the reader and 29.99 a year for the club would the sweet spot for me.
3,Good idea but some inprovments are needed,"The Kindle product represents a great idea, but some functional and/or aesthetic changes would be nice, such as:Ergonomic sidebars, the existing ones get in the way at timesThe kb is a bit clumsy and not very good looking, again a bit of ergonomics would be nice, how about the cell phone idea of a retractable kb?Would Pinifarina or Stark be interested in design enhancement?Last but not least how about connectivity in Europe?JM"
5,Don't leave home without my Kindle!,"YUP! I don't leave home without my Kindle. I also don't turn out the lights without having used my Kindle for reading, playing word games and Scrabble, checking blogs and shopping in the Kindle Store. It passes the time, especially when traveling and having to wait for appointments, meetings, etc. Thank you, Amazon!!!"
3,Not for the avid book reader,"This is a great product in terms of technology. It is comfortable to the eyes and hands. It is also great for anyone who reads the following: blogs, magazines, newspapers, and bestsellers. But for someone who expects Amazon.com's book availability on this appliance will be let down.My first three book searches proved nothing. ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", ""The Catcher in the Rye"", and ""The Beach"" were not available to the kindle. I have come to find that many classic titles are not.Again, if you mostly read bestsellers and such, this is a great product, but for those of us who dig a bit deeper into literature, this product is not worth the buy."
3,Great Device But Cost Prohibitive,"I recently had a chance to take the Kindle for a 'test drive'. A friend loaned me hers to read a novel she had raved about.I found the unit to be a good size with an easy to read selection of fonts, although sometimes not quite bright enough. It was a bit annoying trying keep track of where I was if I forgot to bookmark or if I accidentally hit the wrong 'key'.I did like the Kindle a great deal, but the $359 - $399 price puts it out of my price range, so for now I'll just keep reading the old fashioned way."
1,Not good source for history,Most of the well known historians are not on kindle. If you are looking for books on history that are newer than four or five years old forget it. Kindle has a very limited selection and most of the books can be bought for less at a book sell. They show a lot of numbers but look before you purchase. 10 versions of Story of a slave girl. Several are Federalist and Ati-Federalist papers. They do a lot of duplication to get their numbers up. Look at what you can purchase before you get a kindle.
3,Kindle,Love the concept & the technology & the value that it can bring to me. I don't have to care about carrying heavy books & look for internet instead download the ebooks into Kindle. 200 books are plenty for my reference on the go.Thanks to Amazon for creative & innovative thinking but the price could most certainly be lower than what it is now. Am sure it will go down.Good work Amazon team.
4,It's now my favorite book,"I receive the NY Times first thing when I wake up--just roll over and ask for it, read it in bed. I have several books going--switch from book to book as my mood changes. When my eyes are tired, I enlarge the font. It's easy to navigate.BUT: I am very disappointed not to find Crude Awakening and Break through available for the Kindle. When will important books like that be obtainable?"
4,great product but too expensive,I think the Kindle is a great product but the price is still to high especially when books cost 9.99 and you can't trade or barter them. I will wait till the price is more reasonable
5,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Kindle wireless reading device is the greatest thing since sliced bread. No longer do I have to wait six months to two years for a book to come out in soft cover. I can get it NOW and not have to pay anywhere from 25 to 40 dollars as for a hard cover books. So to all readers out there, you will love this amazing little device."
5,Thanks Amazon!,"Before I ordered this product, I read a lot of the reviews about the Kindle...I took the ""good"" and the ""bad"" and that's how I learned to use the Kindle the right way! I definitely hold it differently, so that I don't press the ""prev page"" button or the ""next page"" button. I don't mind the screen going to black as it turns to the next page. I use my Kindle all the time... I can't say enough about the product... I'm sure they will come up with new & improved features, but I just couldn't wait, until I could carry more than a few books with me at all times. Thanks Amazon!"
2,Books Unavailable on Kindle!,I could get neither Beautiful Boy nor Tweak for my Kindle. The Kindle is quite expensive not to be able to get books I want to read on it and be advised to contact the publisher to request they put their offerings on Kindle. That should be amazon's job! This is very disappointing. WARNING: Check to see if the types of books you read are available on Kindle or not.
4,Almost perfect,"I have read several reviews about the product with the most common complaint being accidental page turning. If used in the case as intended this really is not a problem. Automatic bookmark, typeface adjustment are great. Had it a slot for either a MicroSD card or a SD card for expanding available library it would be perfect 5 stars. This is a must for those who are always mobile. RVs, boats, etc. Need to explore more, can it do POD casts or wikis? What a great device!"
1,Wireless did not work,"I give the Kindle a 1 star because the wireless does not work even though I am in an area that it should work. I guess I received a bad one and that was disappointing. I give Kindle support 4 stars though because they answer quickly, even at 9:00 at night. They are very courteous and helpful and even though they did not help me fix the problem they are sending me a brand new one in the mail to replace it. I can still use the Kindle with a computer to download books until I get my new one. On the down side, it will take a couple of weeks to get a replacement and I am not happy about that part of it. Thanks to Oprah they have a back log of orders to fill."
3,Cover for my Kindle,"So I thought I was buying a very different cover than the one I bought. I like the one I bought, lightweight easy to use, put in purse etc. BUT I wonder if its strong enough for travel.? As you can see this is my 4th Kindle, so as you can see I am worried this leather, lighted cover is not strong enough. Please could you tell me the highlights of this model (on record, fr:amazon) Let's just say I set it on a mattress and sit on it would it be ok? Something close to that?!! Or a dog put his paw on it,I'm just trying to think of strenths. Do you think I bought the correct item? PS I also put a padded cover and leather Belkin on it/ also purchased from amazon. Thank-you OVER concerned, Mindy"
5,Love My Kindle,"I was prepared not to like the Kindle, made sure I saved my receipt,etc. I just adore books, hardcover, paperbacks, as a matter of fact, my floor to ceiling bookcases are bursting with them. Classics, fiction, I love to read. Much to my surprise this was the best gift I've ever received, it's for a true book lover. My favorite time is spent reading the first chapters of a book I might buy,plus the price of the books are so economical making my purchase a true bargain. Reading this lightweight wonder is easy on the eyes and wrists, give yourself the joy of reading with this wonderful new addition to your life. Be a Kindler!"
3,I need dictionary,Most time consuming part of reading foreign language books is finding words in dictionary. It is a great help if this has dictionary capability for the highlight words.
1,"no wireless, no point","I wanted to buy a Kindle as soon as information came out about it last year.This August, I purchased the device. Claims about wireless service (through Sprint) are greatly overstated, especially for parts of the country like mine not served by Sprint. While it is possible to download books via the computer (and I did read two novels downloaded to the computer and moved to the Kindle), that isn't what I wanted to be able to do. Further, I was unable to download magazines and newspapers to the computer. Several emails to Kindle support did not address the problem. The third reason I'm returning the Kindle is that books other than best sellers are not available. Why wouldn't Amazon make all award winning books and authors (e.g., Nobel, Pulitzer, Booker) available, regardless of publication date? I would have loved to use and keep the reader and will keep my eyes open for improvements. Based on where I live, I am unable to get my money's worth and am returning it."
3,Problem: Need to reset,"I was not disappointed with Kindle, it met my expectations. I have used it to read 2 books in the last few weeks and had to hit the reset button 3 times because it locked up. So far, the reset worked. I am very pleased with the ability to preview a book out before buying, the Kindle store is great and exceeds my expectations. Extremely easy to use and downloads a book in a few seconds. I recommend you purchase a cover to protect it. The one I looked at cost about $40. They say it has an intergrated light but the light is not included? The reviews say the clip on light does not work well so I am waiting for a cover that includes the light."
3,amazon kindle,"LOVE my Kindle! It is a wonderful way to travel with books. The only negative - or else it woul receive 5 stars - is the ugly white color and the ""too easy to accidently change pages"" side mechanism. However, all of the convenience and easae of reading make it one of the best thigs I own (and I am not a gadget person).LOVE IT!"
5,Best Generation?,"I was torn between getting the 1st Generation Kindle, the Nook, the Sony E-Reader or the Kindle-DX. I went with the first generation: number one reason? The only replaceable battery. Number two reason? Nooks books are considerably more expensive than Amazon's. Reason number three? $149.00 from Amazon's [...] site. Admittedly, international wireless download is a great feature, and if I am ever in some third world country where I don't have access to a computer, I may regret the fact I did not get the international wireless, but I doubt it."
4,Kindle is a life style choice,I was not positive that I would like this product. My thoughts were varied about the purchase. My major concerns were about giving up the actual book. Reading on the Kindle is so different. It has become about reading choices at any given time and the delivery of my selected news papers. I carry it every day and find myself a bit disappointed if I haven't read that day. This is an amazing device for the way it allows me to insert reading back into my life in a meaningful way. The cost has become an insignificant issue.
5,Re-Kindle your love of reading,"The Kindle solves several problems: 1) purchasing paper books, eating up untold numbers of trees & vats of ink and 2) storing or passing on the books when I've read them. Traveling with ample reading material is no longer a problem either. In short I love my new Kindle."
5,"Kindle, love it","I love the kindle overall. I like the ease that you can purchase books with the push of a button and how fast they download...all while lying in bed! The books are cheaper when you purchase them on your kindle. Amazon.com also has the option to download and read a sample of the book for free before you buy it. The font is adjustable and really is easy on the eyes. The charge lasts many many hours. I'm still playing with it as far as loading background music, etc. When traveling, I can take multiple books with me on my kindle rather than dragging the weight of multiple books like I used to. You can also use it for magazines, newspapers, etc. Better for the environment!My only complaint is there needs to be more space for you to hold the kindle. Right now I'll be reading in bed and accidently hit ""next page"". But I'm figuring out the kinks."
4,Great product,"I love to read, this product allows me to take several books in one. It does have the feel of a regular book. I listen to many books also and it allows me to have those book with me in one package. The experimental additions are very useful and I hope you keep them as a part of the Kindle experience. The one problem I have is with the page turn keys, they are easy to touch even when you don't mean to, as when handling the Kindle. The delivery of the Kindle books is outstanding. Review a sample and decide to read the remainder just a click of the buttons and you can continue, or save it for later with a few clicks. Great Product."
4,"more books, please","None of the books I want are available yet, but my Kindle has already paid for itself. I took delivery on this remarkable device a week before going on a tour of four Civil War battlefields with Pulitzer Prize-winning author Prof. James McPherson. In the middle of remote woods and fields of Virginia, I was able to use the Kindle's whispernet to access Wikipedia (and the web, sort of), and augment the history we were learning/experiencing in real context. Brilliant. I can't wait for the evolution of this product. Kindle's marketing team may want (in the short term, at least) to shift its focus to the wireless, portable research tool it has proven to be, at least for me. More books, please!!! And perhaps you can work something out with Google Books to access out-of-print and public domain texts. I'm suffering from lack of available material, but still love this thing...."
5,Kindle Review,"Awesome product for an avid reader. Convenient, easy to use, compact, yet large enough to read books/periodicals. I'm reading more, am better informed on current events because of easy access to periodicals and new books. Look forward to learning new applications of device. Excellent technical support."
4,Awesome for the avid reader!!!,"I love my Kindle. I read a variety of books, new old, fiction, non-fiction, etc. Not only do they have the new books on line but there is a great selection of older books also. I do wish that if a publisher is going to put the older books in a series available on Kindle, that they would put them all on as I have had to buy the books that are not available so that I can finish a series. Only complaint about the availability. The Kindle itself is great and very easy to use. The design is odd because it is hard to hold without changing the page accidentally but if you get one of the good covers for it with tabs on all four sides, this solves the problem. The only other complaint is that it should come with a light designed for it since it does not have back lighting and again, having a good cover solves this problem because you can hook one of the many reading lights available to the cover. Overall, AWESOME! for the avid reader!"
5,Will it work outside of USA?,"I would buy this item, but I'm not sure whether Kindle will be working in Moldova: we don't have 3G, only GSM. Moreover it is expensive for me. May be I'll buy it one year, in order to have possibility to read electronic books on this device with paper-like monitor."
5,I am flabergasted,"As a writer, I read a minimum of four hours a day (the prescribed amount for any author worth his salt). The Kindle just arrived and this will support this requirement. Depite this clinical use, I think this is one beautifully designed machine. I received mine today and already have so much joy I will need to seek confession before long. Amazon. com, congratulations on this wonderful device. I know it's first generation, but for that, it is right on the money.Edward C. Patterson"
3,Price on Paperbacks,"The cost for downloading hardback books gives customers a break over retail price but WHAT ABOUT PAPERBACKS? With books available in paperback form, shouldn't the cost be LOWER than the retail price??"
5,The ideal Mother's Day Gift,"My wife and I are readers. We are always going to the library and checking out books. We saw the reviews of the Kindle and decided to get one but they were all sold out. We decided to wait until version 2 came out. Then just before Mother's Day they became available and I splurged and bought it. My wife kept saying it was too expensive etc, but now I can't get it out of her hands. I still go to the library for my books while she stays at home and reads. She is thrilled with it. She reads it indoors or out. The picture is clear even in the Arizona sun.It is expensive and is a one trick pony. There are many other things I sure we would like it to do and it is expensive. But as long as you don't have to pay for access to amazon or wireless fees I feel it worth it. I still love the touch of paper as I read but I am somewhat envious of my wife and her new best friend."
2,can't use public library ebooks?,"I like it, but am very disappointed that it excludes public libraries from the picture completely. I thought I'd be able to read library e-books on this too. And how hard would it have been to include audiobook support?"
2,Not ready yet.....,"I was anxiously awaiting my Kindle and feel I gave it an honest effort, but in the end, there were features and feelings I couldn't overcome within the trial period. The product felt awkward to me, especially 'turning the page' and the momentary pause on the page while this happens, was something I could not adjust to. I waivered on these aspects, but in the end, I realized I am just not ready to give up the sensorium of reading. I still need to handle and feel the book, smell the pages, use my collection of bookmarks and have reading be a relaxing experience. I'm not sure about ""turning off"" my books:-)"
5,Kindle Light,I love the Kindle that I bought for my wife. I have downloaded books and been reading using the Kindle more than my wife. She asked if I want one for myself and I would but I wish they would make one improvement. I wish the Kindle had a back light. I wish I could read the kindle in lower light or in darkness so I could read when traveling at night or when in bed before going to sleep.
1,Why Bother?,"Lets see ... aesthetically unappealing, over-priced, impractical. That about covers it. I don't see how this is any better than any other lame ebook reader out there.When I read, and I read a lot, I want a real book. If I can't carry around a book, thats what an iPod and audio books are for."
1,Worst kind of proprietary product,"A hand-held reader to replace a book is a wonderful idea BUT this one takes away too many choices for the reader. To put it bluntly the extraordinary up-front cost of the Kindle itself is only a portion of the total expense. Why?1. The books you download to a Kindle DON'T REALLY BELONG TO YOU. (You should read the licensing agreement carefully.) If they did you could trade them or re-sell them. Or transfer them as a PDF (or another ""reader"" format) to your computer so you could read them again later.2. Because Amazon wants you to buy the Kindle they have taken the choice of downloading to any other type of hardware or software.I don't know about you but I really resent it when my choices are taken away. My way or the highway doesn't work for me."
2,electronic books should be CHEAPER than paperbacks,"I don't know about the rest of you, but I refuse to buy an electronic book reader until A) the reader is about $50 (that's all it's really worth), and B) the electronic books are $1 or so.$10 for an electronic book? Why should it be MORE expesive than a paperback???The recording industry finally realized we're no longer willing to pay $16 for a CD which has just 1 or 2 songs on it that we want. Perhaps the publishing industry will soon learn we're not willing to pay $10 for electronic books.Think of the possibilities--maps, pictures, sound, even video could be part of a book. Why is it taking the industry so long to embrace this wholeheartedly?"
1,Good Idea But... Not Worth It,"It's a good idea, but in actuality, who has time to read multiple novels in one sitting? Isn't that the point of any mobile device, to watch, read, listen or talk on the go?. Also, I'm sure there are some traditionalists who think that the point of reading is to veer away from technology and the influence of modern culture. Nevertheless, this device is not useful enough for $400. Think about it, that $400 can buy you about 30 novels (average $13 per book) that make a very pretty library collection instead of one clunky, ugly piece of 1980's-looking technology."
5,Welcome the Great Library of the 21st Century.,"While traveling down Interstate 44 at 80 miles per hour and reading my New York Times (Kindle Version), my wife informed me she left her book on the nightstand at our Southern home. I asked her what the title was, or author, and she could not remember at that moment, so I asked her to describe the story, and with four words typed into search, my Kindle found it and downloaded it for half the paper book cost.My version of John Lithgow's Poets Corner has him noting a web site to a Robert Burns glossary, and with the click of the wheel, I'm there.Is this a great time to be living, or what!"
5,Kindle is everything I expected,"My Kindle was a birthday present, and I couldn't be more pleased. Reading is easy, downloading is quick, and I can indulge my impulsive tendencies in a productive and useful way. I also like the idea of being able to keep up with current literature at less expense than with conventional books -- plus no additional iibrary space is required."
5,as amazing as I imagined,"purchased my kindle at the beginning of october, and I have already read through six books, a handful of short stories, and a few reference files I put on the device. When I first heard about the kindle I was nonplussed, but once I actually saw one in person, I knew I had to have one.Using the kindle has actually caused me dissapointment when I can't find a book in electronic form (such as the most recent book in Jane Lindskold's Firekeeper series.) and must read it in ""analog"" format. Its just SO much nicer to carry a whole library around in the form of the kindle, than to carry just the one paper book. I'm totally sold on the device."
4,"Wife loves it, only because I paid for it.","Awesome product. No eye strain, cheap and easy downloads from almost anywhere, LONG battery life. The initial cost of $359 is prohibitive but once you get past that you will start to save some money if you are a voracious reader."
4,Love my Kindle!,"As with most others, I couldn't wait for the next version of the Kindle to come out any longer. Even though the page back and page forward buttons tend to annoy me, it's only occationally and having it now far outweighs the minor problems. I love it!"
3,"Great gadget, but requires Sprint cell coverage","This is a great new gadget for avid readers. I purchased it primarily for travel, as a way to carry numerous books to read without taking up a whole suitcase. HOWEVER -- the web info for the Kindle wasn't clear on the download mechanism as it requires a cellular signal from a SPRINT cellular capable tower and NOT a Wi-Fi signal. If you live in or travel to places outside of SPRINT cell coverage (like I do) you must download books to your computer and then sync to the Kindle. If you don't carry your computer with you everywhere this is a problem -- unless you can get a SPRINT signal. I returned the product and will have to wait for a VERIZON capable version! Too bad, really, because I liked the idea of ""instant"" trips to the bookstore..."
3,kinde,"The device itself is wonderful. The book cover provided is inferior. Because of its construction it does not hold the book in place and allows the Kindle to fall out. Plus, the band to hold the book together, is very primitive and not of the quality of design for a product of this nature. It's not much better than a rubber band. As a result, I have had to buy an aftermarket book cover that is built correctly, ironically through Amazon. I really feel Amazon should reimburse for this, given that it had to be purchased to correct for a design flaw."
1,Amazon employees in India,If you want to purchase this product keep in mind that you will be dealing with Amazon via India. I am not dealing with Amazon anymore for this reason. Profits rate above customer service. I am cutting up my Amazon credit card. I am really glad that I don't have stock in this company.
1,Kindle misses the boat,It would be great to be able to get the L.A. Times and other reading material from Amazon delivered to my laptop with no connection charge as is the case with Kendle. How about a plug-in card for my laptop to implment this? Why should I have to have a second $360 device in addition to my laptop. The Kendle is a much less capable device. Laptops are in common use now. Amazon and Kendle miss the boat. I rate the Kindle concept zero stars as a marketing mistake.
3,"I'll wait, thanks","Kindle could be a wonderful device. As a technophile and a bibliophile, it should be at the top of my wish list. It is not for two reasons: It costs four times as much as it should, given that the business plan for kindle will depend on buying books, not the device. And in every demo I've seen it is a rather gray page, and there is no color. I'll wait in hopes a future generation will respond to these two concerns."
1,"For $400, the books and magazines need to be FREE","You've got to be kidding me... $400 for an electronic device that allows you to purchase reading material? Notice the price difference from buying the real thing as well- not much different. You also can't break a book if you drop it. So you can buy a $10 book on amazon for about $7, or pay $7 for the electronic version that ONLY works on this device. Let's say you're an avid reader like myself. What if you lose your device? It gets stolen? Broken? Not only are you out your $400, but also whatever you've spent on reading material to populate it, that you now have to re-purchase to replace. It's a compact disaster waiting to happen. Thanks, I'll keep my paperbacks.Save your money, folks. What a scam."
2,Do we need 'another' device to carry? No.,"While it certainly seems like a nice idea, having another 'dedicated' device just isn't going to work. It was annoying enough to have to carry a pda, gps, and a phone; this one too? Nah. Not for me. At first the novelty of being able to download and read anytime I wanted was nice, but very shortly I simply didn't use it other than at home or work; and I could always just use a computer rather than carry around another device. The only place it seemed 'right', or of use rather than being just another accessory, was where lots of guys do their reading; in the john. Which is not exactly a glowing praise of the product. Eventually the phone people will have one that takes this product's market as well. Adobe's had it right for quite a while; in the future, PDF's are the only way to go for print, and audiobooks will take that market eventually as well. This is not a product I would invest in."
5,Exactly what i was hoping for!,"Just got my kindle on Monday. After reading on it for about an hour i completely 'forgot' i wasn't reading paper. It is really comfortable to hold, and although the page flip can get in the way i don't think i will have a problem adjusting.My only gripes are 1) that i wish i could subscribe natively to RSS feeds 2) the SD card slot was on the top/side and more easily accessible. 3) native PDF support for all my downloaded booksPhil"
5,I love My Kindle,"I love my Kindle. For those who want to go green, well this is it!!! You never have to buy another paper book again. Not only that no more clutter of books in your home........Its great !!Thanks Mieke"
5,Its here already??,"Camcorder was shipped via USPS and we got it in five days. Defiantly worth the price, although all the manuals were in Spanish for some reason. Didn't really need instructions anyway since the camcorder was very user friendly."
5,A thorough and highly revealing study.,"Fletcher's book provides a revealing portrait of the Cid, separating the historical man from the myth. The opening chapters provide a glimpse of Spain during the Middle Ages, while the subsequent chapters focus on El Cid. It is a particularly useful book if you are only familiar with Charlton Heston's Cid, or with the epic poem, El Poema del Cid. Thought provoking, and exceptionally well-written."
2,"Eh, formula - pass","This is contractual obligation formula non-sense. You can't distinguish this from anything else on psuedo FM rock radio today. I own over 1,000 CDs and this one is trade bait. Sylvan, if they ever had anything to say, are all out of ideas.Were these guys named after the WWE wrestler with a very short career or vice versa. I am filled with a great emptiness."
5,Very good CD.,"Great CD. The music is catchy and clean, without anything I'd consider terribly age inappropriate for teenagers and above. It has some very interesting lyrics, and I'm glad I stumbled across it. I'd definitely buy more Sylvan CDs based on this one alone."
5,love coconut products,"Coconut oil and coconut products are so good for you. You can find out about the different types of fats in this book (a science primer), and you'll also find out how healthy it is to use coconut oil and coconut products in your diet and health regimen. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve their health and beauty with coconut oil."
2,Chutzpah is right!!!,"Dershowitz has balls all right... still trying to absolve himself from the liberal insanity of defending OJ, he pontificates and trys to justify the defense of his daughter's assaulter\potential rapist.Everyone is entitled to a equal defense, and Dershowitz's try's to illustrate this by defending an octegenarian Harvard scholar accused of murdering a Nazi War criminal. Prandus the Nazi war criminal had murdered the professor's family during WWI. The only mind sicker in this tomb than the Nazi Prandus is the author.A word of mental health to Mr. Dershowitz stop writing looking for absolution and go speak to a rabbi."
5,Just Revenge,"Fantastic story, one of the best WWII fictions to come along in years. Twists and turns every step of the way, and heartbreaking connections will be forged with the characters if the reader has any heart at all. Highly recommend this to any WWII buff or historical fiction fan, as well as mystery story readers. The research that went into this is obvious and thorough."
4,Compelling but wanted more about Ringel (Dershowitz?),"This is one book most people will not be able to put down.My only big disappointment about the book is that I wanted to know more about Abe Ringel. I wanted to hear more about this thoughts. I wanted to read more about his legal maneuvering. Yes, I also wanted to figure out whether he was Alan Dershowitz saying that the professor really wants to only take on innocent clients."
1,A ridiculous story and distorted Judaism.,"This book is so bereft of any value that despite my having a library of thousands of volumes, I had to throw out my copy of Just Revenge, as I saw no justification for keeping it, and there is no age group or anyone at all that I'd recommend it to. The story is absurd, and placed within the context of a heavily distorted Judaism, and supposedly Jewishly observant family, where father condones housing daughter and lover, and where a ""great professor"" of Jewish philosophy is mouthing statements that are repeatedly ridiculous. The only thing that became clearer to me is why the author's children want out of Judaism. This book has no value AT ALL."
2,Another circus and SHOW by DerSHOWitz's victimhood.,"Well, I was wondering how long it would take this Showman and hindsight Attorney who takes on cases after they are decided would write a novel? Most of the novel reminds me of his views on making up defenses for the guilty so many think he is wise? The book is a very poor attempt of a second guessed lawyer writing about being involved with a victimless hero. Alan is better at creating fiction in the court room rather than creating fiction in books."
2,Boring,"We had to read this book my criminal law class. The actual story line was fairly realistic, but the way Dershowitz writes is too predictable. Each chapter seems to represent a single distinct thought, which takes away from the overall story. The ending was so cheesy its not even funny."
3,Sequel to The Advocate's Devil.,"Introducing us to the characters of lawyer Abe Ringel, his daughter and Abe's Israeli girlfriend and partner in his previous book, The Advocate's Devil, Alan Dershowitz now has readers wondering at what cost can revenge really satisfy one. Just Revenge also explores the legal ramifications when one man takes the law into his own hands to settle the score over incidents which occurred almost 50 years ago.By now many of us have read accounts of old men brought to trial for crimes committed during WWII and the Holocaust. And when as a lawyer Abe is asked to defend an old friend who has meted out his own form of justice, it not only becomes a questions of legality but one of historical significance as well as ethical and moral questions as well.The book moves along at a good and interesting pace until almost the end when it becomes much too convoluted, unlikely and even predictable for those readers who like a happy ending."
4,feliz navidad,"I don't know about the other cuts on this cd but the title cut is worth having it alone. it is a terrifically upbeat christmas song that's contagious. don't know the details, but this cut could not be released for years because of some legal deals. It's Mexican flair reminds me of my childhood in Texas and I remember it as my most favorite contemporary Christmas song."
1,Not as advertised,"there was no CD ROM included with the book, so I would say that's false advertising. I emailed the merchant, but there was no response."
3,"Not the best for serious players, but good for just starting.","I ordered this guitar thinking that it would be easier for me to handle. I ended up using this guitar about 3 weeks and then searched out a different instrument. You definitely get what you pay for. It's a good start, but if you're looking to really get into playing the guitar-- spend a little more and get a better instrument."
1,Waste of money,The guitar you see in the picture is not the guitar you recieve.Before buying this product I advise you read all of the reviews because they alot say the same thing. So what is going to make your order different.
3,You get what you pay for.,It's a cheap but fun knife. The knife is made cheaply but it also costs little. Ultimately you get what you pay for.
5,DVD,It was received just as said they would be and by the time they said they would be here. We are a Walker fan so we think they are very good.
4,Sweet,"Finding Preet was one of those movies that made you feel good in the end. Sometimes it doesn't matter how you get there as long as you do and while this movie took me a couple of minutes to acclimate, I found myself really enjoying it. I got sucked in; I worried about Priti & her dog, I Laughed at her parents' antics. The joy in her moms' entire body when she said she wanted to meet some Indian boys, the poor chef trying to escape pizza and move onto haute cuisine. The love interest I had issues with but not everyone is perfect I guess, but I'm not the forgiving type when it comes to money. It was like being invited into a friends life to see how things turned out. I like the fairytale aspects and the little dancing girl. The soundtrack was great. The costuming was awesome, and I have to say grandma holds a special place in my heart. I'm giving it 4 stars because in the end all I want is to be left feeling happy and Finding Preet did exactly that."
5,great for lots of ideas for ages 2 to grandparents,"uses things easily found around the house, including making glue.great for fun projects needed spur-of-the-moment"
4,Little Hands,"This is a very useful book for a parent who wants to work along her child. Activities are well explained and organized by supplies needed, so you won't have to browse through all the pages to find something appropriate for the supplies you have at home. Also, though not clearly stated, there are holiday activities. Older children, especially those younger than nine, will find this book useful. And, they should be able to follow thw instructions with very little help, if any."
4,A Powerful Little Heater,"I have this heater in my garage. I live in the Northeast and my little 12x16 Garage gets very cold. This Dimplex heater works great and does not take long to heat the room to a respectatable 70 degrees F. 220 Volt Heaters are the way to go. Have had my share of the cheap 110 Volt Units and they have their purpose for small spaces. My only complaint with this Dimplex is that it is noisy and that the heater regulation knob in the back basically has two speed, full on and full off."
2,not so good,i was so disappointed i also have read all of her books and waited so long to read this one. what happen to this one please go back and read your other books and don't do this to your fans again we love your work and know you can do so much better. sincerely debbie
5,IT KEPT ME WANTING MORE,"This is another book that I read all the way through. It's a good murder mystery involving kids, which I love with a passion. If you like books in that discription, get this book, you won't be disappointed. And if you are, that just means you have extremly bad taste. ;o)"
4,It's good to have friends when you are in a bind,"When his house becomes run-down beyond repair and is finnished off by a flash flood, Mr. Rusty recives help from The Prickles family, and the rest of Fern Hollow.They pitch in to build him a new house which looks really nice. The town furniture maker Mr. Chips also donates a wheelbarow full of new furniture, and their friends give bits and pieces from their own homes (which unexplainably are not flooded).Despite the implausabilities throughout this story (Mr. Rusty and his family are the only flood victims, and his train conductor job did not provide any assistance for bad events like this!) it is a charming tale of friendship and community support. I also like the detail to drawings, my family has kept these books many years after I outgrew them specifically because of the quality illustrations."
4,"Good, not great, but good","As independent movies go, this one is pretty good. There are moments of unintentional humor due to some acting/writing/editing, but that gives the movie some of its charm. I understand they used many local (Nashville area) actors/actresses. Some are quite exceptional, and some are less so, but overall the quality is good. It is certainly worth an hour and a half to rent or buy."
1,This is a deception on the part of the seller,"The seller claimed that the product is like new. When I received the camera, it looked very used and worn. There is a crack across the lense and there is white paint splatter on the black USB cord. The seller didn't include battery, which is supposed to come with the new product. I e-mailed the seller but got nothing in return."
2,A miserable movie with marvelous music,"I don't know if Cuba Gooding Jr. needs a new agent or new therapist, but for such a good actor it's hard to understand why he's doing such poor pictures. This picture is terrible. But having said that, much of the music is wonderful. Even the hip-hop, which generally I don't enjoy, was well done. But what really makes it stand out is the gospel. If you enjoy this style of music you must hear it here. But save yourself wading through a boring, unoriginal movie and get the sound track album instead."
4,"Uplifting, fun, music-filled movie","Though the movie had a predictable plot, it was still so fun and thouroughly enjoyable to watch and to listen to the great gospel music. Cuba and byonce were great and so were the other characters...they were all charming. Also, I liked seeing a church and a choir that was made up of both black and white singers. I was glad to see Rue (from ""Golden Girls"") play a part."
1,Will Not Work on Modern Macs,"I picked this game (copyright 2005) at the Apple store in the US. I brought back to Saudi Arabia and slapped it into my 2007 20'' iMac. It will not load. So I wrote to customer service. They told me that the game does not work on new iMacs with the x1600 video card. I did not see that in the system requirements. What other Macs will it not work on? Seems the only way to tell is to buy it and hope.All in all, it is an older game and is now being dumped at low prices before it is completely obsolete."
2,nursing school book,I found the diagrams in this book extremely hard to follow. I also found the book to be very dry reading. I hope you never have to read it.
4,1001 Arabian Nights--Tales,This book exposes the 1001 Arabian nights for what they are--spell binding tales from the Middle East!Good story book.
3,trouble funk sound,the sound on the cd is not that good. i had to totally adjust my sound system to try to make it decent enough to listen to.
3,jeans,I have mixed feelings about these pants. They are of a thicker material than I thought which I think is ok but they are also short in length which is not ok. They do ride down the hips a bit but I guess that is expected.
4,Lee Jeans,"I love these jeans. I wish I could have gotten them sooner. The fit is great little big is the waste, but perfect everywhere else."
1,NOT 4 GAUGE!!!,"This is NOT 4 gauge... maybe 6 at best! I am not sure what gauge measuring device they are using, but it sure as heck isn't 4 gauge. Bummer!!!"
1,A Contract On America,"The reactionary lunacy contained within this book and the opposition it engendered provided a major contribution to the success of the Clinton administration. It's a book for people beliving that America should be a country with a minority of haves and a majority of have-nots who serve them.Nevertheless, it's an important historical document. Read it to understand what might have happened had Americans chosen to go over to the ""dark side."""
2,Not mention as discription,"The book looks fine, and usable ,but it is not describe as it mentioned. It is not like new at all."
4,O.K ALBUM WITH ALOT OF BUMP.,"THIS ALBUM IS O.K,THE LYRICS ARE PRETTY GOOD.THE HOOKS ARE KINDA STUPID ON SOME SONGS.THE PRODUCTION IS GOOD FOR THE MOST PART.THE BEST TRACKS ARE(HARD ON ME)(BLOOD IN BLOOD OUT)(REALA THAN MOST)(CALL ME/WHAT YOU WANT) AND A FEW OTHERS.I RECOMEND YOU GET IT MAN."
5,Grimm 1,"Great show, great cast, good writing , fun for the whole family if you're not to squeamish. I'd say age 12+ would enjoy."
4,quick product arrival,"dvd met all expectations..bought used. clean perfect, as if brad new. completely satisfied. would encourage others to purchase this DVD"
5,Must see,I cant wait to watch the rest of the show it was a great idea and the play back of the show was great.
3,Pilot,"Coming off of reruns of Buffy and Angel, it's nice to see another magical venue. Having only seen one episode I'm not as grabbed with this as I am with other shows. Has some compelling characters tho and I look forward to seeing more."
4,Good,"Very interesting indeed, a little cheesy but it made me end up buying the whole season. Has a hint of an X-Files flavor"
2,A Useless Tool for Novel Writing,"I met the author of this book/software at a writer's conference in 1999. He gave it a lot of hype, saying that this can cure writer's block. So, I bought both and took them home. I installed the program, tried out the tutorial, and tried to use it to cure my own writer's block. I was sorely disappointed by the lack of variety and an 80's feel of the plot situations. I wound up returning the software because 1) It wasn't user friendly, 2) It didn't meet my needs, and 3) It was overpriced for what it had to offer.The book is basically lists all the plot options available in the software. Don't get me wrong, the concept of the book/software is great. Sawyer just needs to develop it more and modernize his plot segments. This book, I feel, is good for subplots or short stories. All you have to do is take the basic premise of each segment and tweak it until it suits your needs."
2,Hard to understand,"This book is probably very good in many ways, but it is hard to read with all the codes and references and cross sections. I frankly don't have the time. There must be a better way to write a book like this."
3,Could've been better...,"When I started ready the A-list novels, I thought they were really fun. The three previous A-list novels were awesome, but this one is somewhat disappointing for A-list. Characters that were dominant throughout the third book such as Danny and Ben were given less roles. I had expected to hear more about them, but was disappointed when they were barely mentioned. Well, all-in-all not a bad read, in fact it is actually fun. But when compared to the other A-list novels, it could've been better."
5,Great Movie,I think this movie is great! If you've been in the Navy then you will get some of the humor that so many miss.
4,Very Funny,For my husband. He enjoys movies like this. The whole family sat down to watch together. Great time. Will be trying to find more of this type of movies for my husband.
4,buena comedia,"INTERESANTE TEMA PARA QUIENES ENTENDEMOS LO QUE SE RELACIONA CON OPERACIONES NAVALES, LOGRANDO ADEMAS MANTENER INTERESADO A LA AUDIENCIA, CON DIVERSAS SITUACIONES QUE CONFORMAN UNA AGRADABLE COMEDIA.-"
3,"Good Info, Poor graphics","The information contained in this booklet is good, but i would like it more if it had a little more graphics to ilustrate with more detail how to build the infraestructure needed to start an operation as well as a checklist of the materials and equipment needed, but in general i would say the booklet is good."
5,Lifehouse puts a new spin on rock,"In todays music industry, Lifehouse is a rare breed; a great talented band who is using their voice for more than inane swearing and spouting off. Instead of feeling like killing yourself after listening to them, you feel like they've actually breathed life into your soul. Good on them for daring to stand out and be different. (Sad isn't it that good, straight-up, music is what stands out in todays world?)"
4,Oh yes.,"The field of Freudian studies - either praising, interpreting, misinterpreting or debunking him - is a grossly overcrowded one, with far too much low-quality, under-informed comment. Which is why it's so good to see a work that is genuinely deserving of praise. Make no mistake about it - Wank is on his own; there's no-one else to touch him."
3,Nothing lives up to Malvern,The book by Malvern is simply the best continuum mechanics book ever written. Gurtin pales into insignificance although written 20 years later or so. I had to correct the reviewer from Leipzig
2,368 Pages,"But only about 240 if you remove all of the quotes from Conrad, Dana, Mehlville, etc.Truly a letdown."
3,Nice retrospective of rare and hard-to-find soul ballads.,Some of the rarest and most obscure 1960s and early-'70s soul ballads are found both here and on volume two. I personally prefer the second volume because of its wider variety but if you are into the sweet soul sound you will also like this one. The sound quality on most tracks is not very good but acceptable due to the extreme rarity of these songs.
4,Works great,The size of these binders holds lots and it holds materials needed in a secure fashion. I haven't had it long enough to comment on its durability.
4,"Great Product, but...","This is a great product. The ring mechanism is outstanding, and it is made especially so that sheets placed in the front view don't stick when removed. Why then, would they put bar code stickers on these notebooks that don't come off?????? I don't know about you, but I don't have time to get the nail polish remover out to clean this sticker off of 8 binders."
1,Broke in only a few days,I only used this for a few days before the top prong developed a gap that now rips all my pages. :( Definitely NOT heavy duty. Complete waste of money.
5,3 inch Avery Binder,It worked just fine for the memory album. I couldn't find this size in any of the stores in the area
5,My kids loved the movie and this CD,"My son and daughter (age 7) have seen the movie twice, they loved the movie, and they love listening to this CD. Actually we often listen to it together while preparing breakfast or dinner, and we parents like the CD too, because it brings back the spirit of the movie, it makes everyone want to dance, and because it's fun to listen to the wide sampling of energetic popular music. Excellent."
3,only one song I play over and over,"I agree with most of the previous reviews that the CD did NOT carry a lot of the music in the movie. And I ask ""why not?""OK, the re-done songs by Brittany Murphy and Robin Williams are cool. I can even get with the fact that the only reason they re-did them was so their voices matched the voices in the movie.I can't get enough of the song ""Hit Me Up"" by Gia Farrell. The CD sits in my car CD player on ""1 song repeat"" only on this song.If you can download just this song onto your MP3 player or iPod, then just get the one song.Otherwise, make sure you listen to samples of ALL the songs to make sure you really want to buy the entire CD.I hope for a ""reprise"" too. HEY MOVIE PRODUCERS : Give us the music IN THE MOVIE!!!!!"
3,Where is the rest of the music?,I like the songs but this CD does not include ALL the music played in the movie. I am very disappointed.
2,Disney at its greedy best,"I wanted to buy just one song off this album - ""A Mi Manera"" by Robin Williams. It's the only one that I thought worth the $$ - but Disney won't let us. That sucks."
1,Slow and reception cuts out,"This cell phone has numerous issues. Sometimes it won't shut off and it takes forever for the buttons to respond. I have received warranty replacement and it still does the same thing. Also, the reception is lousy and calls get dropped."
5,Great Follow-Up Book for the Ladies Farm,Thoughly enjoyed reading the latest Viqui Litman book. The characters leave you wanting more. Can't wait to start her next book in the series.
5,Toss out the rest and stick with the best,"I've read lots of books about trauma but this, by far, is the best I've found. It is written with great compassion and without bias. This is a well written clinical analysis of trauma in all it's forms and the recovery process which follows. I highly recommend."
2,trauma and recovery,I am not sure if I missed the point here. This book was recommended by a Psychiatrist to help me understand P.T.S.D. I really did not learn anything I did not know.
5,Andrew R,Brilliant. Just brilliant. Awesome insight into how trauma affects us on a societal as well as personal level. Read this book. It is well worth it.
5,excellent,"This book should be required reading for all persons involved in trauma studies. It is comprehensive deals with the history of trauma, deals with both trauma on the level of private trauma-as in domestic abuse; trauma resulting form relationship with institutional belonging such as the military; and trauma as it is pervasive in our society via media. The author then provides key components to facilitate the healing of trauma. Again, this is a foundational work for anyone working with trauma. The only caveat, and this is a WARNING the paperback copy is miniscule, about a 6 point font, if that. I have good eyes and struggled to read it to the point I bought a used hardback copy. I reccommend purchasing the hardback."
1,Crappy guitar,"This guitar may look good on the internet, but it sucks in real life. When it came in, it had the wrong 3rd string. Even the spare third string was the wrong one. So i had to go out and buy the right string. The guy who sells these guitars makes them in his home. When you open the package it smells like spraypaint. I also had to chip some black paint off of the frets. Also the pick is cheap. So in my opinion this guitar is no good, so i suggest that nobody buys this product."
5,Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr,"How could you not like this film? Nic and John have studied each other character to the finest detail. It is pure talent even if you find the plot slightly unbleaveable you will just love the action, the dialog and the acting. This is my film of the century."
2,Travolta and Cage at their worst,"One of the worst action movies i have ever seen. Maybe if my education level never progressed beyond 5th grade i could have enjoyed this movie. This was completely unbelievable, i am not an expert on the human facial composure but i think there may be a few NERVES and TISSUES that might make cutting around the face and simply lifting it off a little difficult. The movie made the swapping of faces look as simple as cut and paste on your pc. Not to mention the ridiculous action scenes, i don't know about you but i see big boned Travolta and scrawny Cage and all i can think is after that they should be dead. But no, they just wipe the dirt off their slacks and begin another scene twice as ridiculous, predictable, cliche and impossible as the previous one. Forget Dvd or vhs this belongs on the slide reel."
4,Woo could do better!,"john woo tried to make this top noch movie. but it was not really that great. i saw a lot of film errors. and every time a big action scene was going like the boat exploion you could see that there where stunt men! but the story line was good, and i loved nick cage's gold colt.1911s that he was carrying aroud in the begining of the movie. if i where eport and ropert i would give it a thumbs up!"
4,Great Action Movie,"Two of these actors Nic Cage and John Travolta really knock it out of the park on this film. For me I'd say Cage dominated in terms of really bringing over the fact of being trapped within another man's face and life, and being that of a person you hate it was quite the performance. One highlight is of the meeting in the prison of the two when all hell breaks loose for Cage's character when he realises his nemesis has the upper hand. Fun ride from beginning to end with the right injection of emotion. This is truly a blockbuster action movie by all merits."
2,Put the face back on... actually never take it off,"This movie has a great premise. Take the face of your enemy and become him to destory him. But I promise you, if you have any intelligence what so ever you will realize that this the dumbest idea ever. At least whoever the hell wrote the movie, tried to make sense out of it, tried to make sense out of cutting your d*mn face off. But the whole thing could have been avoided if they had just beat the crap outta who they needed to get the info from. Nick Cage and John Travolta have no where near the same body. How'd they change that? Yeah, John lost weight but how'd Nick gain weight? You'd have to smoking rocks in order to believe they could pull this movie off, and then smoke more rocks to think that someone could be talked into having their face cut OFF. If you buy this movie, you should also buy some Enron stock and book your flight for Iraq for that mid-summer vacation. Trust me and keep your face on."
1,You got to be kidding me!,"This is easily the worst movie either Travolta or Cage has ever made. It is action without realism, shooting for the sake of shooting (with very little hitting), the camera work and action scenes are ripped off from other movies, and the plot line is totally stupid. I can't stress enough what a smelly peice of hollywood big money trash this is!"
5,NICK CAGE'S BEST,NICK CAGE AND JOHN TRAVOLTA LIGHT UP THE SCREEN WITH POWERFUL INTESITY...I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERY BODY
4,i can eat a peach for hours,You want action? We got action. This movie is why we spend thousands of dollars on a home theater. The DVD picture and sound rock.
1,DVD would not play movie,Thankfully I only paid 1.99 for this DVD. It would not play the movie only the commentary from director & writers. Very frustrating!
2,30 seconds of material stretched into 2.5 hours of violence,"This movie was intended for the same audience that can play ""Doom"" and ""Mortal Kombat"" for hours at a time without noticing (or caring) that their brains have turned to jelly. Yes, there is a plot, but it's not unnecessarily complicated, and it doesn't need to be believable. For reasons that don't really matter, an FBI agent and the terrorist who killed his son exchange faces, so that each must pose as the other. The real point is to shoot anything that moves and blow up anything that doesn't. It's not possible to keep track of the number extras who die along the way. And it's amazing how consistently the bullets, bombs, grenades, and shrapnel succeed at hitting everyone in sight with the exception of the two main characters (although they do occasionally manage to wound each other)."
4,"Good, but not the greatest John Woo film made.","This NOT the greatest Joh woo film that he has ever made; at least as a director for an American production film/Company.There are some fun action scenes and cool explosive shoot-outs, but the plot lacks slightly. The idea of J. Travolta being changed to a ""mad-man"" (aka. Nicholas Cage), but that is the most interesting portion of the whole movie.The rest of the movie is only good during the action scenes, NOT during the dialogue of the other scenes. If you really want to watch a GREAT John Woo movie watch: BROKEN ARROW -or- PAYCHECK -or- his hong kong flicks, with Chow-Yun Fat."
2,"Good classic recipes, BUT...","I've already encountered a huge problem with this cookbook. Obviously, many of the dessert recipes, if not almost all of them, call for Betty Crocker mixes many of which are no longer available! Apparently, they just reprinted this book without taking the time to update the recipes. As a result, there are going to be a ton of recipes you can't make. I know I could probably find ways to make other mixes work, but I bought a cookbook to tell me how to make food, not so that I can experiment. This book will be going back."
2,Each recent version gets worse,"I've used Encarta for many years. However, the 2004 version was the last version worthy of carrying the Encarta name.Navigation used to be extremely simple. Now, you need a PhD to get around. The use of the ""find"" box in 2004 is so much more helpful than the ""search"" box in this 2008 version.This version crashes regularly (running Vista). By regularly, I'd say it crashes 20% of the time. On the plus side, they have all been soft landings and I can re-open without a re-boot."
5,Great student product,"For any student, young or old needing some additional instructions when not in class, this is the program for you."
5,Love the Encarta program,"I purchased Encarta many years ago, and it was good, but this new version is actually better. The student aids are great, as is the encyclopedia. The content is trustworthy, and my kids can use it for school reports and not have to defend it's accuracy."
3,southern living magizine,"I ordered it and have paid for it but, it still has not come yet. I know it takes a while so I am waiting by the mail box."
2,Those Were The Good Old Days,"I received Southern Living magazine, as a gift for Christmas 2011. It finally came about March 2012. Unfortunately, the magazine has taken the route of most magazines these days, which consists of way less content, period. The magazine used to be quite hefty & full of many wonderful things, that appealed to southern women & women everywhere. So, we have a much thinner magazine, but so many more ads. Just what we all want to see (not). I haven't even been looking forward to it coming each month. The only thing, that remains similar to the 'good old days', is that it still has a lovely front cover. But, I can see that, while it sits on the magazine rack, at the store. I won't be requesting the magazine for another gift."
5,Classic,"I've been getting this magazine for 12+years. Lots of great recipes, gardening tips and beautiful photographs month after month. I look forward to getting Southern Living and at this price, it's even better!"
1,not received,"I have not gotten an issue yet so it is hard to review ! When oh, when will I get my first copy ??????"
4,Southern Living,"I enjoy the magazine and have subscribed to it over quite a few years. It is, however, running a lot more ads and the recipe section is a fraction of what it used to be, which was one of my main reasons for wanting the magazine. I may not order it again after this subscription."
2,Can't stop Auto Renewal,The magazine is fine at 5/year but not anymore than that. Couldn't find the 'Do not renew' button/option so I just canceled the whole subscription.Amazon needs to make sure that the Help instructions match reality.
4,Great Resource for the Price,The price point offer allowed me to give a subscription to my relatives for their birthdays. What an absolute value!
3,Southern Living Magazine,"Everything was great, especially the $10.00 thank you from Amazon but my magazinehas not started yet, so I can not speak to that process! I have mailed in the payment I was sent from Southern Living but wished I could have paid online instead. When I tried to do that, it said I needed to contact another phone number and they were unable to help me so I finally mailed in payment. It is the first week in November but still don't have a magazine. This not Amazon's fault but the magazine discounter. I am EXTREMELY pleased with all my orders on Amazon! To date: all my experiences with them has been great! I think that is still called Customer Service isn't it?"
3,"good product, poor billing","I purchased this mag as a gift for my daughter-in-law, had it shipped to her address, and billed to me. Mag billed me and her. She was miffed. I was mad. Makes one want to forgot mag subscriptions all together."
5,Everything you need to know about authentication,"Authentication is one of the 4 pillars of information security(authorization, confidentiality and integrity being the other three); but very little has directly been written directly on the topic outside of the academic community; until this book.Authentication: From Passwords to Public Keys is an excellent work that covers all of the direct areas of authentication. Authentication is a huge challenge in that most users would prefer to have their passwords short and easy to remember, which is exactly what a password should not be.Even if there were a lot of other books available on the subject, Authentication: From Passwords to Public Keys still would be required reading."
5,"Really, really good book",Smith does a great job of writing about authentication while being vendor agnostic.The book provides everything you need to know about PKI and other crucial security topics.
4,very helpful,"As Americans living abroad we have relied on this book to help our children with their English grammer, reading and spelling skills. It has also helped us introduce some U.S. history and civics in an age appropriate manner."
4,Rugged,"I spent 3 weeks in Scotland and heard some of John Squire's songs there. ""All I Really Want"" sums up why I like this CD...""People in Scotland are so poor compared to Americans, but they have a spirit that we may be losing. I like John Squire's rugged voice, guitar work, and songs- they're more heartfelt than what I hear on US radio. I was disappointed to see this hasn't been released in the USA. We need it. Now!"
5,Fantastic Product!,"This was one of the best buys I made. It works wonderfully and without batteries. Just crank it several times and it goes and goes. What a wonderful thing to have if the power should go out. Or to take fishing or camping. The lights are bright and clear, and the radio works well. I heartily recommend this."
5,my favorite film on the topic,"with all the manipulations and propaganda around the tragedy of 9/11, it's refreshing to see a film that is honest, smart, and human."
4,Concise and informative,This book is a useful guide to making the art of Bonsai a little easier for those of us with busy lives. It is full of useful information and good clear pictures. My only critisim is its bias towards USA conditions. Otherwise a good and useful book.
3,"Good stockings, but they don't stay up","I am a 6 foot tall woman with slightly larger thighs. I thought getting the plus size would mean they were better for my height and heavy thighs, but they still don't stay up. If I use a garter belt they stay up alright.If you're shaped like me I suggest looking for thigh highs with gel ribs on the inside at the thigh, because those stay up easily on me."
2,Could be better,"The story is good, the characters are fine but the writing leaves much to be desired. Ms Casavant's editor has done her a grave disservice by failing to rein in the writer's fondness for adjectives, flowery descriptives and tired metaphors. This writer has talent; Twist of Fate doesn't showcase it."
4,Great Buy!,"This book came in good condition. It was what the description said when I bought it. It was great that it had fast shipping. Even though I asked for two day shipping, it came within two days and it did not come late. The book is readable and there are no tears in the pages. Also it was a great price!"
2,this is about as slow and boring as jazz can be,"I was disappointed in this sacd. I'm probably going to try and sell it. The sound quality is very good but the music is very slow and boring, makes grocery store music seem heavy metal. I have tons of rock and jazz, as well as many blues and classical cd's but this is just way to mellow."
2,Not worth it,This movie was not worth the money I paid. My son loves movies and I thought that this would help with a new sister. He only watched it once and it did not help him.
3,Very sloppy cast,"Have been putting this brand on several trucks for the past ten years. This is the only time I had a problem. Had to use knife to cut away extra material around all edges.ALOT OF EXTRA. But $45 for something that probably less than $10 to make and package, and then I have to trim to look nice sucks. Too much hassle to return. Free shipping is nice, but took longer than suggested to arrive in Hawaii."
2,Disappointing,"This album was greeted with some fanfare in the Uk music press, for whom Shack are the current darlings. The fanfare was misplaced: this is an audience-quality bootleg recording, put out on an official CD so Arthur Lee would gain some benefit. Reviewers have commented on what a sympathetic backing bacd Shack are on this recording. Not that you can tell from listening - the poor sound quality tramples on any subtelty and renders it impossible towork out why this is such a legendary gig. If there is a recent Arthur Lee gig that deserves to be released on CD, it would be the one he played at the Garage in London in June 1994, when the High Llamas played as Love. The Llamas brought along flute, harpsichord, brass and strings to add the essential light and shade which Shack - a basic four-piece guitar band - cannot. I believe Arthur Lee said the Llamas were the best Love since, well, Love. And Sean O'Hagan said it was the best gig thet High Llamas have ever played."
2,Side one is good,"If you are short on money, do not buy this C.D. You will regret it. However if you are trying to get rid of a gift voucher or something side one is really good, especially the Dr. Evil ""just the two of us"". Really this is not a good album, as side two is rubbish. I still haven't listened to it all the way through"
1,Payne should have taken a muligan on this one,"This is probably the worst thing I have ever watched. After watching this video I said: well I'll never get that hour back. It is absolutely worthless to anyone who has golfed more than once. Nearly everything is so common sense that even my wife, a non-golfer, thought his information to be pointless. The attempts at humor are rather painful; you laugh, but only because the jokes are so cheesy and imcredibly stupid. Do not waste your time with this, even if it is a rental."
3,It works,It works well just be very careful that you get it lined up exactly right before you stick it down. The glue is permanent.
2,Low price = Definitely low quality in this case.,This is a toy. Wouldn't ever want someone to learn on this guitar. Their first impressions most certainly would last. It was sent it back.Pros:-Price. You will get what you pay for.Cons:-Poorly made. Wood chips were all over the inside of it when received. The frets were plastic and were not glued on properly.-The wood look appeared to be sticker-like.-Sound quality hardly made it a guitar.
3,Diddy-Last Night,"Purchased this CD simply for the ""Last Night"" track/song. Have heard the explicit version and glad that I purchased this one....too bad Sean Combs, a.k.a. ""P.Diddy"" a.k.a. ""Diddy"" feels the need to mess up this particular track/song by dropping the ""F"" bomb repeatedly."
4,american warshipi,likedbecause i am navy man ok thath all i can say the might mo stands out and the best tridion of the navy
3,so bad it's good,"Fun but for sure a cheap version of ""Battleship"". Don't buy it. Worth renting cheap though. Cheap special effects too - but you can't look too deep."
2,Isabelle has issues!,"This story is just plain weird. This book reads as if it were written in a foreign language then translated into two or three other languages before finally being translated into English. It just makes no sense. The paintings are cute if somewhat crude, but the story is bizarre. The bit about the ""lovely statue"" seems almost creepy."
1,Be Careful,"This product is billed as being suitable for a Rout-R-Lift. I'm sure it must fit some of the JessEm products, but it does not fit mine. My lift is labeled ""Rout-R-Lift"" and it requires a hole that is 14.75"" long by 11.75"" wide. The hole in this table is much too small for mine. Check the dimensions of yours before buying."
5,Popular is Still Popular with me,"I was happy to find this on Amazon. I found myself strangely attracted to this show while it was on tv and missed it when it was cancelled. So, now I can watch the first season and laugh again at the crazy antics of these teens."
3,Not very popular,"therefore it was dropped after season two.However, the first time I watched it on television, I thought it was witty and humourous, especially the exaggerated acting and circumstances of Mary Cherry.Now that I've re-watched it, I find the jokes dull and tasteless, although there are certain episodes which are worth watching because of brilliant script-writing such as episode #10 (Fall on Your Knees), #14 (Caged!), #18 (Ch-Ch-Changes), the season finale, #22 (Two weddings and a Funeral).For example the season finale makes a spoof out of teen flicks, episode #10 is a spoof of Poe's Christmas ghosts, there is also an episode to spoof film noir."
2,Bland and predictable,"I was very excited to buy the 1st season box set, but boy was it disappointing. I was expecting something unique, like Freaks and Geeks. The writing for Popular is very stereotypical. Everyone is a caricature. The actors are annoying, with their constant over emoting. Their facial contortions are distracting. This show would best be enjoyed by preteens and immature teenagers. If you are looking for something witty and smart, look elsewhere."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME,The concept of the Eschaton is interesting but never explored.. This is the first book that I know of that has used Chardin's Noosphere as a noun... sort of neat... but otherwise a terrible piece of work... speed read through most of this dreadful book and threw in the trash afterwords.... I would not recommend another sentient being waste their precious time on this beautiful world...
2,Not my cup of tea either...,"The author has the POTENTIAL to be really good. In fact, it is almost as if two different people wrote different parts of this book. I found the Martin/Rachel storyline to be fairly decent reading.Unlike the master reviewer, I didn't have any trouble understanding the quote he provided. However, there was plenty else I didn't understand, and more importantly didn't care, about.I also question why the author waited until around 120 pages into the book to explain the Eschaton to us clearly.Overall, I'd skip this book. It was my first for Charles Stross and I don't think I will give him another try.-Tom"
3,Starts well...,"...then it drags, then it ends pretty predictably.I just love all the notions that are thrown out in the first few chapters: assemblers, disruption of the political economy, value-adding critics, God-like beings stomping on time travel before it stomps on them, the effects of initial conditions on the internal structure of universes. These are all fun notions.Then the fleet travels, and the book unravels. Fast.In fact, I found myself wondering whether the author hadn't simply come up with some great opening chapters - enough for a novella - and then thought ""What now?""Anyway, the book has a good-enough beginning to suck you in until the end. Though you will probably find yourself thinking ""It's got to get better. It's got to get better."" about half-way through."
3,Would have made a better short story.,"While the book is interesting, and has a number of interesting ideas, the character development is minimal. Also, the characters do not drive the plot, instead the plot happens to them. 337 pages was too much to devote just an exercise in universe-building, even as interesting a universe as is presented here. This would have been better as a short story, where the reader does not expect as much from plot and characters. I would be interested in seeing a better story in this same setting."
2,This got a Hugo nomination?,"Sorry to say it but please add my name to the list of readers who found this book boring,poorly written and wildly overrated. I give it two stars instead of one because a few of the ideas in it werent too terrible and because it showed enough promise that I might possibly pick up a Stross book again. In paperback. I've enjoyed some of his short stories so hopefully he'll finda way to make his longer fiction work."
1,Sudoku-Play at Joe's,"the games cannot be identified so that you can save them and do later. I like to print out the blank game, then print the possibilities and then see the answers. I tossed this product as unusable for me."
3,not my cup of tea,"just not my type of craft, thought the subject was interesting and the artist gives good ideas and instructions to follow..."
4,Handy little book.,I bought this as a gift for my beloved who found the patterns and stoke styles very helpful in turning out some very much improved animal rocks.Anybody want any........ please?*she will kill me for that!...*
3,Rock Painting,Great book. I just need a bit more artistic talent. Maybe with time I will get better. But it is fun to try.
3,Why the what?,"I loved Dave Eggers first book and was looking forward to reading a well written novel about the plight of the people of Southern Sudan. While Eggers does his best when he's just telling the story of Valentino, I found his intermixing of Valentino's current life and his experiences back in West Africa to be a great idea but very distracting in practice. The flashbacks really slowed down the pacing and for the first half of the book I had to make myself keep reading. Once Eggers focused on one liner story, it was much more compelling.As others have pointed out, there are plenty of non-fiction books on the lost boys of the Sudan so Eggers choice to fictionalize parts of the story for what can only be assumed to drive the narrative, fails.There are certainly compelling parts to the story and I was often touched by the journey and trails and I finished the book, but I'm disappointed by Eggers' narrative and fictionalization and I can't recommend it."
4,a bit much,"Writing in the voice of V. A. Deng, Eggers is consistent, realistic, and an excellent story-teller. I am certain this story, although a composite of several (many?) other boys' tales, could conceivably have happened to one person, horrific as it would be. My question is what makes it of interest to people for whom suffering at such a level is practically inconceivable. Why are we reading this (as well as Beyond the Beautiful Forevers, among others)? As a novel, I found it unbalanced; as a biography, that doesn't apply. So how to judge it? The suffering, the terrible events pile one on another so that any ""good turn"" that occurs sounds false. Meeting the man with a bunker full of food which he shares in the midst of the horror reads like a fantasy intruding on a mind destroyed by deprivation and pain.Do we need stories about the depravity to which war drives people? It seems we do, as it continues in other places. Do you need to read this? That's the question."
4,"Disturbing, but worth reading","The story about the lost boys of sudan, and their subsequent experiences in th US, is disturbing. Bu definitely worth the read. I like how dave eggers has written it in the first person - the voice of one of the boys."
2,The title might be redeployed as the title of this review,"The title's teasing proverb might be redeployed as the title of this review. ""What is the What"", is an uneven effort. On the pro side; This is a desperate, African adventure story with a noble and honest hero (perhaps too noble in some of his confessions). To it's credit, I also thought that the majority of the dialog seemed to capture an authentic African voice and banter. Further, at times, the author's attention to detail is truly riveting. On the con side; just as often, the authentic English African translation is a little stiff and dispassionate. I believe this very good book could have used a very hard edit. It is spread too thin, attempting to capture too much of the Lost Boy's journey and struggle."
5,Hard-hitting story packed with real-world insights,"WHAT IS THE WHAT is no light story: it's the hard-hitting novel of one Valentino, a refugee of the Sudanese civil war fleeing from his village, who becomes one of the Lost Boys - children pursued by militias and shunned by the world. His long journey to the U.S. with some 4,000 other Sudanese refugees starts a new struggle for survival in this hard-hitting story packed with real-world insights and recommended for any literary fiction holding, whether it be public lending library or personal collection with an African focus.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
4,"The more screaming and guitars, the better.","Lit truly expose all with "" Tripping the Light Fantastic"". It is far more expressive then "" A Place in the Sun"" which basicly has many ballads about love and relationships.During the time period of this album, the members of Lit seem kind of ""casino crazy"" which makes up many aspects of their album.It's great how A.Jay Popoff screams on this album. I believe the more screaming, the more passionate the artist is about their music. This album is great for people who love screaming and guitars"
5,Good if you know what you like,This album is really good if you look for music in places that you wouldnt normally look. Like alot of bands these days Lit unfortunately sold out with thier recent albums but also like most bands you gotta find and listen to thier first album in order to really know the band. Unlike kids these days that pick up a band cuz all thier friends listen to it and get only the newest albums. Lit is a great rock band and i enjoyed this album alot but i would not recommend any of thier other albums because of their transformation into a pop sensation in recent years. This album alone puts Lit at the top of my list for good rock bands though...rock on!
5,hardcore lit fan who loves this album,"well, i am obsessed with lit first of all. i ordered this CD 7 months ago from their website and its not as good as a place in the sun but if you love them as much as i do, you will love this album. check out the older version of no big thing!"
3,Not As Good As First,"The first Lit CD ""A Place In The Sun"" is an excellent album and gets 5 stars in my book. However, ""Tripping The Light Fantastic"" Is not as good as the first one. This CD is more hard rock with not as good of a sound as the first one. I still like listening to Lit though, and if your a real hard rock fan, you will probably enjoy this one."
1,Two Problems,"My OS is Windows XP Pro SP2.Problem 1:Sometime the GUI cannot be closed. I tried both the Exit (or Shut Down? don't remember) command from menu and the X button on the upper right corner. The GUI window just stays there and does not close. It seems like this happens if I log onto my account, run this software, log off, then log on and run it again.Problem 2:When I debug VC++ 6.0 projects, the VC always freezes after 1 or 2 minutes after the debugging starts. After the Spy Sweeper is uninstalled, everything is fine."
1,5.5.1 unusable with dial up,"5.5.1 is a joke, and the Webroot response to my requests for help is a joke, consider different antispyware, or use 5.3.1, period."
3,Works.....but a memory hog.....,"This program does work but it is a memory hog. Would I purchase again, no. If they fixed the memory issue, yes. I'm a phone technician by trade and sometimes webroot has deleted my files calling them viruses. I wasn't even aware of the deletions until I try to use my programs, very frustrating."
1,Version 5.5 slowed my PC to a crawl,"As many people in these reviews have claimed, version 5 is a real hog. After installing and running the application for a few days, I was forced to remove it. It slowed everything to a crawl. Switching between windows took 2 seconds. My CPU usage was usually at 90 to 100 percent. Fortunately for me, the disk I purchased had version 4.5 available as well. I have been running that version for about a day without the same problems. I would recommend to my friends and family to avoid version 5.Sincerely, Steve in Florida"
4,Really good Antispyware product,"I'm really not sure where these terrible reviews are coming from. Maybe the product slows a really old computer down, but so does just about anything running in the background. I used the free anti-spyware products for awhile, but this software is much better to me. It's like having a spyware bodyguard in your computer. I search for all sorts of things on the internet and I don't worry about a website 'hijacking' my computer. This product has been good to me. I highly recommend it. I don't like to buy a software suite. So I just bought the anti-spyware of the Webroot software and another product for anti-virus. I've been using the software for over a year and just renewed for another year for $9.95 with a coupon (look for one searching Google). Well work it!"
1,Are all her books like this?,"The ""heroine"", Larisa is so foolish and easily manipultated. There's being naive but this is taking it to extremes. On the other hand it is ridiculous to think that such a young, naive girl would be so easily and quickly seduced. Let alone that the seduction would be so enjoyable and without any regrets. Her life would have most likely been ruined in good society but she goes about her business as if nothing has occured. I am afraid to read any more of her books."
4,Sensual and Fascinating,Our hero Vincent and heroine Larissa are very passionate people who find themselves torn between the incredible attraction they feel for each other and the strong reasons why they should rather hate one another. Home For The Holidays is a very sensual and fascinating story of how these well drawn characters learn to look beyond prejudices and into the value of another human being. This is a highly entertaining read which I highly recommend.
1,saddly disappointing,"I have all Ms. Lindsey books, but this one was a terrible disappointment. I usually take one day to read a book this size. This one took me three days but only because I heroically resisted throwing it away so deeply frustated I was. The hero is not likable at all. And I couldn't understand how the heroine fell in love with him after all the horrid things he plotted and done. Furthermore, the female character has no depth, nor substance. I hope Ms. Lindsey's next books are as good as the Mallory ones."
3,Lindsey still sliding?,"I began my love of romance novels with Johanna Lindsey and have read all of her novels. For those of you who have, like me, been disappointed with her recent works, I am proud to say that this (to me) is much better than the ones in the most recent years. This one is considerably shorter, but I found that better. In her most recent works I found myself getting very bored in the middle waiting for something interesting to happen only to feel that I almost wasted my time reading for days. With this one, I read it from start to finish and didn't get bored once. Please don't get me wrong, it is not nearly the J.L. I was hoping for but it was better.Bottom line: If you want a book that is a cute, christmas story that will be a short read between christmas shopping, go for it. However, borrow it if you can b/c it really is not worth the amount that you have to pay for the hardcover book."
1,unlikeable hero ruins Lindsey book...,"my review is short and sweet-don't waste your money on this book.The ""hero""-if you want to call him that-is a callous, unfeeling cad who begins the story by having the heroine and her young sick brother evicted at Christmas time. He then proceeds to seduce this naive girl, for kicks and revenge.I want to read romances with heros that rescue heroines from jerks like this.The hero's secretary resigns in disgust within 20 pages into the book-I suggest you do the same.Tripe, poorly written to the point of headache inducing, DEFINATELY not up to Lindsey's usual fare, and definately not Christmas worthy.Have a Merry Christmas-skip this book:(1 star for a pretty cover."
1,This item was not functional and I can't tell if I received a credit from this vendor.,"This vendor was not cooperative. They sent this item and it appears, according to the vendor, this was the last item like this they had in stock. I believe they were trying to unload a broken item and possibly knew it's condition when the sent it."
4,Like the 500 better,"As my review title states I do like the 500 better. Reasons: It was slimmer, less static, mute button and no charge cradle can charge by usb. What is odd though is this earpiece has much better sound the volume can be adjusted to a much louder level than the 500 and 500v. Another negative, when I received it there was a crack coming from the blue light to call button. Now if jabra would only combine the two they would have in my opinion the best behind the ear bluetooth to date. I hope their working on it :)"
5,Jabra BT250v blue tooth,"I have been pleased, with this blue tooth. It was easy to pair to phone and easy to work."
4,solid early 80's poprock,"The Hawks were one of many midwest rock groups who struggled to get out of the ""Great White North"". Like ""Husker Du"" and many other midwest rockers, they didnt' seem to be able to impresss the music industry west of Denver or east of Louisville. Like ""Head East"", they could pack a bar or arena between St. Paul or St. Louis and all the college towns in between, but they couldn't break out.Their power-pop sound would have fit the early 80's music provided by ""The Knack"", ""The Romantics"" or ""Scandal"", yet they couldn't get the air play outside of the midwest. Both albums-""The Hawks"" and ""Thirty Seconds over Otho"" (Otho,Iowa, their home town) are gems-worth while if you can track them down on vinyl.This compliation gives you a good taste of what might have been, but the under-lying albums are much more fun-worth the effort to find. Having seen ""The Hawks"" several times in midwest bars and owning both albums, I can only say they deserved a better fate."
4,It's good,"The wire is high quality and seems to be pretty well insulated. only downside is it wasnt exactly 100 ft ( roughly 95ft ) also wasn't 8 gauge wire but slightly bigger than 10 gauge which works out great because I'm running it as speaker wire. I wasn't expecting a whole lot from it since its $26 for a roll, but did meet expectations."
2,A Very Strange Movie,"This movie starts off with a very interesting and promising premise - a man who is getting fed up with the increasing stupidity of the American public (as evidenced by the type of TV shows that people watch and that continue to be popular).The main character then expands his anger toward the mean-spiritedness that also seems to be increasing in this country.With this introduction, this movie had SO MUCH potential!Unfortunately, it goes downhill from here, in that whoever wrote and/or directed the movie politicizes it by trying to lead viewers into believing that all of the mean-spiritedness in this country is caused by conservatives. (I guess he doesn't spend much time watching MSNBC weekday evenings.)In the end, though, it's the liberals who end up looking silly and mean-spirited (probably unintentionally so on the part of the writer and/or director)."
1,Wrong Director,"Whoever directed the trailer should have directed the movie. As is the case in the industry the trailers our produced by the marketing folks (usually). Anyway the marketing people knew Bob's movie was badly written, terribly directed and in general not very intelligent but with a good trailer they got some of us sucked in, good for the marketing guys.Bob in the future hire whoever produced the trailer to direct and edit your next attempt at film making.This movie is just bad cinema, definitely feels like a high school project."
1,liberal hatefest,"this movie starts out blowing a baby away,then goes on a tyrade against god and anything conservative...disgusting movie put out by angry liberals"
5,Modern American Purity.,"Perfection in a movie in essence to today's corrupt system. This movie says, and does, what every educated American truly thinks through in their heads after viewing the garbage which is aired to us via television."
2,Meh - liberal nonsense,"The movie itself starts out kind of humorous. When haven't we run into some of the obnoxious personalities in this movie and briefly wished for some ill fate to befall them in the near future. However, this movie quickly turns into some sort of liberal nonsense and gets really preachy at the end. The most interesting thing I found was the film's use of violence. As is routinely seen in real life when liberal zealots act out they use violence to solve their problems in the name of peace. It is a really odd hypocrisy that in order to stop the unfair treatment and violence the lead character kills all those who are, in his mind, being unfair or violent."
5,"Awesome movie, my friend and I loved it.","Really nice movie. Something I would think about doing if I was put into the situation he gets into. My friend and I enjoyed it, and provided us with a lot of conversation on what this country has really come to."
5,Preaching to the choir,"This will doubtlessly fail to polarize anyone. From reading the ""negative reviews"" I see that the people who don't like this movie find it liberally biased. I find it depressingly accurate but not really illuminating.To get to the point:This movie's point will either be your own and elicit a ""no crap"" from you, or will be alien to you and seem ""biased"" I guess."
1,Not worth my time,"Overall a boring movie. Unbelievable dialogue, especially from the high school girl character. Not one but two theater shooting scenes, kind of sickening after the events in Colorado. Offensive untrue depiction of ""Tea party"" participants beating a Parkinson's patient. In the credits the term ""teabagger"" is used. Glad I didn't pay to see it."
1,I don't get the good reviews.,I thought this might be in line with a Grindhouse-type movie - or at least a 'bad but so good' B movie - but it was neither. I found it boring - dumb quite often - and don't understand all the good reviews other than the subject of the movie could have been 'funny' if done well - but this wasn't done well. Bad movie - wouldn't watch again.
5,Very good,Very smart. The movie seemed to even mock itself and predict how the public would understand it. Hats off to Bob!
4,Very useful for SAT II and precalculus classes,I am a high school math teacher and I have been using this book in my precalculus classes. The author presents a unique method of combining math with TI as well as giving a variety of examples each of which is fully solved. This book is also useful for a self - teaching student as the book covers every detail sequentially from basics to advanced levels. The examples are neat and the solutions are detailed. Every student and teacher can use this book very confidently.
5,Begin to learn Statistics through this book,"For a beginner, it is really an excellent book. It almost has included all of the most important statistical methods practiced in medical research without pricing at detail loss. Its way of lucid writing and rich examples can help a beginner read through the whole book with some joy. For a senior one on this field, I still think that he/she can take it as a handbook and believe he can find some clue before he pays more attention to another throughly reading.The new edition adds a lot of new contents especially the Bayes' theroy which is becoming a fashion in nowadays."
2,It not really worth it.,"I rented this from a local movie gallery where I live, and even though the animation is good, I'll have to agree with most of the others that the story line was not as good as it could have been"
4,Worth the money,"If you're an Urusihara fan, buy the video. The art and character development is superb, and having nubile females running around topless never hurts a film any. ;O) I bought the video and I enjoy it, and I seriously recommend it to anyone who likes action packed Anime."
2,paralegal study guide,This product was published in 2004 and there have been so many changes in the laws that I feel the legal information is outdated. If you need practice with reading comprehension and vocabulary then the guide is adequate.
4,"Point less, but fun","I'll start off by saying that I'm easily entertained when it comes to anime so use your own judgement in getting this. Now, I actually picked this up to spend enough money in order to get the free shipping on some Weiss Kruez (Knight Hunters) tapes. I chose Fortune Quest because I saw the name Mukai Natsumi. Natsumi worked on the manga +Anima which I LOVE. Back to Fortune Quest, while not as good as +Anima I found it very cute and entertaining and I love the opening theme. So if you like you anime cute and fluffy this is for you. Also it's nice that the whole family can watch it. Most anime tend to be PG-13."
3,Somewhat disappointing but still enjoyable,"Blues have been a staple of Joan's music for many years. Songs like Tall in the Saddle (one of my personal favorites) and Cool Blue Stole my Heart are classics. This new CD takes the genre head-on and it becomes the focus of essentially the whole CD. While it left me underwhelmed as a whole, there are some gems embedded within the album. ""Empty Highway"" is one of the strongest Joan songs I've heard in a long time. The emotional impact brings me back to The Shouting Stage with its stirring lyrics and musical composition. Baby Blues Eyes, the major acoustic contribution is a highlight. Unfortunatley also included in the CD is the essentially unlistenable Deep Down. First time in all my years as a Joan fan have I skipped a song on her CD....immediately I press the next song button. Overall the CD is good but a disappointment. Her last release, Lovers Speak was such a great CD that Into the Blues pales in comparison."
2,defective discs,"I just received the Persuaders triple movie set and there is a defect. The first movie is in color but the next two are black and white. The packaging says, and the screen shots are, in color.The opening and menus are in color but the scene selection shots are b/w like the movie. This rules out my dvd reading the disc wrong. What a weird defect. I hope Lionsgate offers colored discs for the second and third movie."
3,Some frustration,"The tracks and train are very durable. Setting up the figure 8 requires patience and adult help, but since many other shapes are possible a child can play alone. The magnet connectins are weak and the cars come apart easily. This frustrated my 3 1/2 year old granddaughter."
2,Terrible quality,We bough this set because my wife love the hand painted blocks. However this not compatible with Thomas & Friends train sets. The trains do fit under the bridge. Also one of the magnet's on the supplied train does not work and so our child cannot pull carriages with the train. Also the wheels on the train are flimsy indeed. To make matters worse not all the track pieces where lining up. But to save a few mm's on the bridge to save money. What a shocker!
4,A light hearted mystery that might make you a tad hungry...,"This is a fun little book. It might not be completely realistic or a accurate in a few places, but what it lacks in sincerity it makes up for it with a lot of warmth and good feeling. No matter what the situation whether someone has just been murdered, attacked or is being accused of murder the main character is always baking something delicious. In fact so much so that it made me hungry just reading it. She also seems to have a habit of falling off cliffs, getting knocked out or crashing into bushes. A tiny wee bit accident prone. It is a light hearted read with middle aged Nancy Drew like heroine. I also loved the fact that the author added the recipes of all those delicious items the main character prepared, in the back of the book."
3,Try the recipes!,"The book was entertaining, but the recipes are great! The Wicked Blueberry Coffee cake and the chocolate chippers were both big hits with my staff!"
4,Good read!,"I really enjoyed this book! Found it hard to put down - was always cheering on the main character and wanting to find out what was going to happen next. I'll at admit, at times I was shaking my head going ""No sane person would do that"" (not in a good way..) but overall I really liked it :-)"
3,Clue In Cranberry Island Maine,"The pieces (a picturesque island, small town eccentrics, and murder) lie before you but MacInerney fails to connect the dots. Underdeveloped characters, forced plot movement, and a ""Scooby Doo"" wrap up make one run from the resort island with only the recipes cooked up at the Bed and Breakfast. Two and stars - for the recipes."
2,A Survival Kit for the Elementary School Principal,The material is rather dated. There are better resources available. The book was of little use to me. This was not a good investment.
2,Four stars? Are you serious?,"I actually like this series a lot, but I felt this installment was lacking. Actually, I thought that it was the worst book in the series so far. Some people are just completely out of character. Nate turns into a whiny little brat at the sight of Blair (Oh, he's been cheating on her all this time with numerous girls and SUDDENLY it bothers him that they aren't together?). Venessa turns into a sex fiend (Wait- Venessa?!). Not only that, but Blair happens to acquire a new boyfriend out of the blue... and a British Lord no less! And Serena is exactly the same: perfect. Just once I would like to see Blair triumph over Serena van der Woodsen.I'm not gonna lie: I'm going to read the next book in the series. I just hope its a lot better than this one."
2,Adler's Duesenberg,"Dennis Adler's Duesenberg follows his basic formula for a book, a very competent photo album with little or nothing in the way of historical insight. He regurgitates information found in other sources and often repeats erroneous information. He performs no primary research nor provides information to make this book an important addition to an automotive library."
1,Robert Munsch Book,"I was really disappointed in the book itself. It was tiny (5x5 at best!) I bet I look at the ""fine print"" next time to ensure the book is of somewhat normal size..."
4,Pinero,An amazine lyrical ride through the life of a true artist/poet. This movie pulls together all the vices of a man whos comand of language was that of a street poet but pulled at such reality and emotion that his world became a vision in the mind. Bratt's emotional conection to the part made it seem like he was Pinero himself. I was so moved by the movie I bought all of Pinero's books.
5,Great for you little one's imagination...,"This product is not super sturdy, but is much more stable than cushions and blankets for fort making. We have used the Cranium Super Fort for sleepovers, indoor games on a rainy day and anything my kids decide it will be that day - a plane, a pirate ship, a castle...the possibilities are endless!"
2,Inconsistent. Works great WHEN it chooses to work.,"Buyers beware of highly inconsistent quality of Palm Vx device. I love my own Palm Vx and bought one for my mom. However, she has had nothing but problems with her Palm Vx. Her Vx crashed several times, and everything got erased. In addition, her Vx never managed to charge up its battery, and it runs out of power immediately when out of the cradle. I apologized profusely to my mom for the bad behavior of her Palm Vx, and we returned it. Now she wants something with the Pocket PC format.While my own Vx works just find most of the time, I have been having trouble with the USB hotsync cable. The cradle works fine, but the USB cable worked only once and has failed to work again."
1,Palmone Vx,I wanted a regular palm pilot to keep addresses and appts. The one I was sent had no way to connect to my computer for backup. I will not use this and will send it back this week. I don't need email or internet on a simple digital PDA.
3,consider the sony clie if you're a road warrior,"This Palm VX is a great PDA. But the main problem that i have with it is that I run out of battery power when I have to go to Europe or anywhere for long periods of time. I don't want to lug around the cradle to charge it and so I think the Sony Clie is better because it allows you to charge directly with the AC adapter. With the Palm VX, you have to buy the travel kit separately. Also the Sony Clie delivers more value since it is less expensive and the form factor is just as good."
5,my palm vx,"The palm vx is the best thing ever!!!! There is endless uses for it and not to mention the ultra sleek and thin case, in which it attracts alot of attention with friends. Im a freshman in high school and i found it to be really useful in keeping track of my assignments, help to do my math, and keep me up to date with up-to-date new (and its also fun to play a game or two during class =) ) At first i was prolly like some of you. You want one, but you dont think that you would have much use for it and your kinda skeptical. Now I would be totally lost without it. In conclusion, the palm vx is the best thing that i have come across. It's the best invention since the flushable toilet. I believe that everyone should have a palm. GET A PALM VX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(screen protectors are also nice to have)"
5,Like Carrying a Pen,"The best thing about the Palm Vx is that you don't have to think about operating it. After the first few days, it just becomes something you use, like carrying around a pen in your pocket. It looks professional, is durable, and has a great high-contrast screen. You don't have to think about recharging it--just put it in the cradle at night when you sync with your workstation, and it charges up from the day's use in just a few minutes. I've never had mine use more than about 15% of the battery capacity. The Palm fits in my shirt pocket, and the fold-up keyboard (sold separately) actually fits in my front pants pocket if needed.If you're thinking about getting a PocketPC, don't. It's too much to think about while you're on the move. If you need what a PocketPC can do, you might as well get a compact laptop. The Palm has more than enough power and software available to do meet most people's needs."
5,100% Satisfied,"Spend some time researching these devices before you buy one... I looked at the comments on Amazon.com as well as on various internet news groups. I also tried out my friends' palm III's and V's. The Vx is probably the best-available PDA out there. Obviously, it doesn't take the place of a full-fledged PC -- that was never the designer's intent. I'm saving up for a laptop as well; the handheld CE machines I checked out (including Casio and HP machines) were ridiculously cumbersome to use."
5,Excellent overview of history of monotheism,This book is truly an excellent overview of the 4000 year history of monotheism. Very readable and very insightful. This book deserves the highest rating. I do believe it will come to be considered a classic work of the history of religion.
1,LITTLE UNDERSTANDING,"Karen Armstrong is remarkable only in her absence of concrete understanding. She has absolutely nothing of substance to say of the Jewish God. (If you would understand, read Book five of Torah, Maimonides (M-Torah) and Herman Cohen's excellent study of ""modern"" Judaism (as explored, not created, by Hillel, Maimonides and a bit of Spinoza), ""Religion of Reason: Out of the Origins of Judaism."" If she has any understanding at all of Jewish ethics or the Jewish concept of God, she hides it well. Her actual understanding of Christianity is better. But she has a conventional, child-like understanding, as opposed to no understanding at all. One could obtain a better understanding the progression of God by randomly asking people on a New York street, but they would have to be over seven, just to be fair."
2,"Not about ""God"", but about Judism, Christianity, and Islam.","Don't be misled by the title of this book, I opened it up thinking I might read some discussion about how the concept of God was created and/or evolved within the Human mind, instead I got a history lesson and facts ad nauseam about Judism, Christianity, and Islam (e.g., Adam said this, then Abraham did that). Karen Armstrong was a former member of the clergy, it shows."
3,hISTORY OF GOD,"FULL OF DETAILED HISTORICAL INFORMATION. SHOULD BE READ AS IF IT IS A TEXT BOOK OR PERHAPS AN ACADEMIC PAPER FOR SCHOLARS. DOUBTFUL THE AVERAGE AMERICAN READER CAN DIGEST ALL THIS SCHOLARLY WRITTEN INFORMATION. CAN BE USED AS A REFERENCE BOOK IF THE AVERAGE READER, AS I AM, CAN MUDDLE THROUGH WHILE SEARCHING FOR DESIRED INFORMATION.THE AUTHOR DOES DESERVE A LOT OF CREDIT FOR HER EXPERTISE IN THIS FIELD."
4,Investigating the Mysteries of Religion,"Karen Armstrong unravels the history of religion in A History of God:The 4,000 - Year Quest of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. This exploration of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam explores the similarities and differences as well as the growth and intercnnectivity of these three monotheistic religions. Armstrong delves into historic inaccuracies of commonly held beliefs of religion while explaining the origins of those beliefs. Anyone wishing to better understand their own religion or the religions of others will be well-served by reading A History of God. Armstrong brings her theology backgraound to this well-researched, interesting, and enlightening book."
2,Biased,Somewhat interesting but very biased. Even on the A@E special tv review of this she made some biased unfactual statements ref Christianity - that Jesus himself had never claimed to be God...not true. A patchwork of biased information ref all the covered religions.
2,Not all that bad,The book is rather a narrow examination of the philosophical conception of god. This is something which over time has altered with the change in the way that people think. The book is thus somewhat remote and rarified rather than being a history of religion or of the various churches.The book is not nearly as much fun for atheists as other works such as the Barbarian Conversion by Fletcher which describe the changing nuts and bolts of how the church works as a very human institution. The looking at doctrine tends to limit the mechanics of how a religion works in day to day life or how it affects people.I would also imagine that the book although clearly written by may seen as a bit academic for some.
2,No history here,"I was hoping to get some good history on God. All I got was 600 pages of contortionist philosophy. Reading this book was like wading through mud. If you believed in God before reading this, you won't afterwards."
3,History of Religion,Very detailed and almost grueling to get through but profoundly interesting and gives a serious student of religious history supportable background information.
3,Missing Chapter?,"The author has so much minutiae, yet has left out out all discussion of the evolution and nature of the three branches into which Judaism has evolved and the implications of this. (Reformed Judaism gets about half a sentence.) Did a chapter fall out on the way to the editor?"
3,Great intro for a beginner like me,"Just started to catch up on a little history of religion and must say with so many options out there this definitely puts things into a concise and manegable format, plus with so many sources it can be a great go-to for future readings."
2,Should've known better,"I bought this at the store after reading the reviews on here. Needless to say, I was very disappointed.I don't see any difference in how much I sweat with this deodorant vs others. And my absolute PET PEEVE is when a deodorant forms little powder balls on your armpit up after a few hours of wear, and then it falls on your clothes when you try to brush it off! Whoever says this stuff doesn't rub off on clothes, must always wear white. I should've kept with my theory, if it's white on the stick, it WILL be white on your clothes too.The only reason I don't completely hate this stuff, is because it smells decent and the scent seems to last a while."
1,Horribly boring!,"One word: boring!I love films that are dialogue driven, but this has nothing to say. The dialogue is boring, the story is boring, the characters are boring. Don't waste your time."
1,I'd skip this one...,"I was very disapointed with Rotman's attempt fix his first edition of this book. The wording is still overly dense, the topics skip around too much, and the examples are less than illuminating. At least he fixed the 10 by 10 orthogonal latin square on the cover to be correct this time. I think Hernstien's classic ""Topics in Algebra"" is a much better introduction"
5,"His best yet - quite different, a more mellow tritt.","I expected another rock-abilly Travis Tritt CD - which I love, but instead this CD has more ballads. Never the less, I think it is his best yet. What a talented writer and singer. You will not be disappointed."
4,great album,"I JUST RECENTLY HEARD THE NEW SINGLE ""COUNTRY ANIN'T COUNTRY NO MORE"" AND RUSHED OUT TO BUY THE CD. WHAT A GREAT SONG, TRUE TO OUR TIMES. THE REST OF THE ALBUM IS GOOD ALSO. SAME GREAT TRAVIS TRITT QUALITY!"
3,Not like their last album at all...,"The Channelsurfer's last album was soooo awesome... crunchy guitars and plenty of funk. The lead vocalist did such a great job. I don't know what the deal is with this new one, but he tends to whine too much. The actual musicianship is quite good, but I bought it expecting more of the same. Sorry folks... you may like the new vocalist, but he's too wimpy for me. Take a listen first if you are used to the old surfers."
1,Not satisfied,Even though the book was new the binding started to come apart only 2-3 weeks of use. Time wise it did take longer than expected. Not very happy with this purchase.
2,"yes, it's pink but","This hat hurts! The ""soft"" band inside---where is it? My hands feel it but my head doesn't. Hmmmm..... On my head it's pretty tight and hard. I got it to match my pink cowboy boots-which I love but this hat is not what I expected."
5,Writer's Dream,This book really cleared up a lot of misconceptions I had in my writing. I am sure I will now publish more. I would even take a course from the author Thomas B. Sawyer if I could get one.
2,Confusing book,This book was very confusing and very indepth. My professor even confessed that she had to read chapters multiple times to understand this book. This is definately above my reading level and difficult to understand. This is a tough read. I wish I never had to buy this book.
5,Have to give it five,"The only thing that could make this better would be to include Strokin'. However, it is still a five. If you love soul, you gotta have Clarence Carter in your collection. Highly recommended."
3,Not at all like the book.,"I was a little disappointed after I watched this. It is nothing like the book and I understand that it is a very large book, but I felt like they were trying to fit most of it into a short period of time which could be a little confusing for those who had not read the book. They took a lot of the small things out which, I feel, make Amber..well AMBER! I thought the movie was entertaining to watch, but in the end it was a big disappointment."
5,Absolutely Amazing,This product literally healed my hands which were red and painful from the heat. This is NOT just a moisturizer!!!
2,Senior Moments,"This program is an ""OK"" for seniors. Actually, if might be better than OK, but the presentation seemed remote and stiff. If you really want a GREAT program for seniors ( especially targeted for disabilities or beginners) try Gentle Fitness by Catherine MacRae. What it does better than most is to incorporate a very wide diversity of many types of exercises. The actual video shots are some of the best and MacRae and the group seem to make themselves at home with you."
3,pretty and unique,"This ring certainly is unique, and it is designed to rest comfortably between the fingers. I find that this ring does tarnish easily, and that the mother or pearl segments are rather thin. I don't wear this ring very often because I'm afraid that one of the segments may crack. But it is nice for special occasions. It came in a very cute little box, and Peora shipped the item to me very quickly. I'd recommend this ring to anyone who enjoys antique style jewelry."
3,"Great TV show! DVD quality inconsistent, but watchable","The other reviewers covered the inconsistent quality issue so I only have one point to make--inspect ALL the DVDs when your order arrives. I bought this set over a year ago and have found some DVDs in the middle and end to have moderate scratching as if the DVDs were NOT NEW as purchased. Since my order is outside of Amazon's return window, I have working with the seller--Roger J Farney to see if I can get replacements. Afterall, I purchased the set NEW, not used. Bottom line--make sure you inspect ALL the DVDs! I'll let you know what the seller offered to fix the situation."
3,no digital remaster,"These are the great Little House on the Prairie tv show exactly as I watched them how ever many years ago. There has been no digital remastering or clean up to the original film. Colorings a bit off at times and you definitely can tell it is the same quality as the original film. Content is good though, good clean films for the family."
2,WHY ON EARTH would they release edited versions on dvd?,"WHY ON EARTH would they release edited versions of the Little House on the Prairie shows on dvd? That can be compared to a music artist suddenly deciding to re-release edited versions of your favorite albums to shorten the songs and it is just as RIDICULOUS. Or how about re-buying all your favorite movies all over again that you already own on full version dvds just to get the edited versions? I will repeat, that is just as RIDICULOUS and they'll be lucky if I pay $30 for this 60 disc box set because thats all theyre worth when the shows are NOT complete. Hey I want to watch a fully complete Little House show NOT an incomplete one. RE DO THESE DISCS OVER AGAIN."
4,The CD is so good.,"I am very glad I bought ""The Best of Thomas Whitfield"". All of the songs on it are very powerful and capture Thomas Whitfield's style and talent very well. The only flaw in the CD is that the time range of the songs featured is limited. Nearly all of the songs are either the new versions of classics (such as the ones found on ""Tribute to the Maestro"") or they are from his last CD ""Alive and Satisfied"". But all in all, this is a very uplifting and joyous CD. I get a good blessing every time I listen."
4,Funny & Intelligent!,"I was very wary of this book after I bought it. After I quit reading Tales Of Uncle Trapspringer after about 50 pages or so{which is the only DL book I've EVER quit reading}& hating every short story about gnomes, I wasn't sure I wanted to dive into another book solely based on Krynn's smaller races.But then the author's name caught my eye.I remembered absolutely loving Dan's short stories about the Bulp Clan. I dove in.I laughed for about the first 50-70 pages. Almost constantly. After that, the book turned a bit more serious & just as good.Read this one. You won't regret it."
4,Woohoo!,"This book was just great. Funny as heck, but there was some good action tied in. This book would have gotten five stars from me, but I thought that Dartimien was written too much like Raistlin."
3,Amazon needs to sell the unedited Director's cut,"Well, for one, this dvd does not need to be called Adult/Hentai. The anime does have a few seconds of nudity but nothing sexual. It does however, try to squeeze in panty shots whenever possible. The action is much like Kite but less graphic and is more suitable for a younger audience. When I mean younger, I don't mean 15. If you like Kite the edited version, then you will like this as well, this one with a bit humor added to in. Expect gore and lots of guns, as always."
3,Editing,The story left alot of things unsaid and there could have been alot more done with it. As far as the amount of sex whether it is present or just hinted at depends on if you get the edited version or not. All the reviews I have read for this one say it was only hinted at and had a few panty shots. But the version I own there is at least two sex scenes with the first lasting a couple minutes and the other about 5 or more I think.
4,An excellent pick,"This is an excellent anime. I really enjoyed mezzoforte. the art work was outstanding. The story could have used a little work though, there were alot of ""things"" left unsaid that could have seen a little more depth. I think over all it was very entertaining though. And I don't mind watching it more than a couple times."
1,Read the book & skip the movie!,"this movie is terrible...i give it one star because the scenery is beautiful. i loved this book, i loved quoyle and missed him in the end. kevin spacey is not quoyle--mr. spacey doesn't even seem to know quoyle--which is such a shame. how can we come to love quoyle if we can't get to know him.spend some time reading the book--the two hours you would've spent watching the movie would be better spent with the book."
5,Spectacliuar Acting!,Academy Award winning actors Kevin Spacey and Judi Dench are totally awesome with Cate Blanchett and Julianne Moore for the leading characters. But most of all I loved Jason Behr( former Max of Roswell) as Dennis Buggit he got right into the character as if it were actually him especially totally ingnoring his dad ( Scott Glenn) until th alleged death and wake at the end. Plus he made a great comic relief for Spacey during the wood working scene.Lasse Halstrom is an awesome directorI would recommend this movie to all the Roswellian fans who have watched Jason play a teen alien and to anyone who would want to see an awsome movie.
5,Good Movie,I really enjoy Kevin Spacey. This movie was proved the point. The story is good from the first line. Kate Blanchett really did a great job with her character. Matter of fact all the actors were good. I would recommend this movie to any one.
3,Uneven Acting and a Disturbing Storyline,"This is a disturbing film, a film filled with anguish, dispair, fear and grief. To be sure, there is goodness and hope as well, but you'll be much happier with your own life after you've witnessed the lives that these characters have suffered. Although the film ends on a positive note, this is not a ""feel good"" film; you'll be drained and feeling uneasy by the time it concludes. The acting is overall strong, although Kevin Spacey's performance is a bit uneven. Julianne Moore turns in her typical strong performance and Dame Judith Dench was very well cast."
3,Good but depressing,"Kevin Spacey shine's again, he is quite the brilliant actor, however be warned the plot to this film is not one that is going to entertain you and make you feel good after watching it. Although it is an EXCELLENT story, it is very depressing. Worth a look though!"
3,It almost misses the dock.,"This film displays first class acting and some beautiful photography. The problem is with the writing and directing. The script, especially at the beginning, is a bit confusing, and the stereotypes are far too crude. The incest and rape aspects of the story come later and help us understand what has been going on for about an hour. The sex scenes are junk (do we really need to see the rape of a 12-year-old?), and the sight of Judi Dench on an outdoor toilet is a bit much!Well, the complete loser, played by Spacey, finds love and happiness (or at least sex) at the end of the story,and we leave the theater as comfortable as we might have in, say, 1955. But looking back at all the cruelty, violence, and general nastiness in this movie, one wonders if there aren't better ways to spend a couple of hours."
4,Very good scenery...,"... of Newfoundland. Stark landscape, hard people, good acting. The film plays on the Scottish settlement there, hardcore Calvinist hardheads. Saw the film some time back, am now reading 'That old ace in the hole' by the writer, highly recommended. She can create in words a sense of place and local characters, does hr homework!"
3,not much difference 2005 altima,GE H1-55NH/BP2 Nighthawk Automotive Replacement Bulbs - Pack of 2Save your money and stay with stock bulbs and save a few bucks!
3,Not as good as the First,"My kids and I loved the original ""On Moonlight Bay"" so we thought that we would give this a try. It is not as good as the first - although it does have it's redeeming points - thanks to Wesley and Gregory ! The music is so-so, also not as good as the first."
1,not impressed,"I bought this set for my 8 month old that loves to bang and drum on everything.....except this toy. It doesn't do anything what so ever. There is very little stimulation and frankly, i still can't figure out the point of the main drum that is covered with plastic that doesn't make any noice. Don't bother with this one unless your baby needs something to chew on!"
5,Husband's Best Pick in the World of Peanuts,My husband received a cannister of these peanuts for Christmas 2 years ago and now wants only this brand/kind. Great quality & great price. Will order again & again.
4,Good on grammar detail but poor on conversation.,"I had been learning Turkish for about two or three months when I read this book and I went through it in 2 days (about 5 hrs). I think it's a good introductory text and with regards to grammar, remarkably complete. I've learned things from this book that books dedicated to Turkish grammar had forgotten to mention. There are 4 tapes and they start off slower than another language pack I have for Turkish. I wish there were more conversation dialogues. This is the thing that is missing. This pack along with the Colloquial Turkish (ArIn and Sinan BayraktoloGu) pack seem to cover everything I think I'll need. I'm quite happy with this book.p.s. Don't let the negative reviews of people who don't seem to be able to put in the effort to learn something put you off! Turkish is no harder than any other language to learn."
2,The American Revolution as a socioeconomic class conflict,"In the Urban Crucible, Nash attempts to demonstrate that the American Revolution was a duel revolution against England and the traditional ruling classes. He shows how the economic effects of the boom and bust cycles following the various wars of the 18th century affected the colonies, specifically the port cities. The result of these increasingly disruptive economic cycles--especially after the French and Indian War--caused the colonists in the port cities to rebel against England and the American elites because of economic concerns. However, Nash offers very little evidence that socioeconomics was indeed the main motivation for revolution, and he offers no evidence that class warfare really existed."
5,Beautiful and entertaining,"This movie is a joy. Rome looks beautiful from the back of Moretti's vespa and the scenes on the southern islands and in the mountains are stunning. Moretti's observations on popular culture, modern medicine and politics are dry and very funny. And there are episodes of lighter humour, like the infuriating but delightful children who jam the public phone system and the encounter with the American tourists who provide 'Bold and the Beautiful' updates to Moretti's soap opera-obsessed companion. Many images from Caro Diairio linger in the memory and it is a movie which will pass the test of time."
2,Not to everyone's taste,"Kudos to those who enjoyed this film. I realize that it is a movie laced with dry humor, and dedicated to the proposition that even an insensitive, dead-beat Dad can return to his family and reform enough to make life better for everyone. However, the quirky characters and dysfunctional situations were just too far out for my enjoyment. To each his own!"
2,Misleading,"My husband and I recently rented this DVD. We had both seen the previews and were expecting a really funny movie. There were some funny moments but overall I felt that the previews were very misleading. Any movie that has a character attempting to commit suicide because he is in love with his (adopted) sister, along with several other no-so-funny moments (a drugged out character running over a dog...but its ok because another dog is found immediately to take the place of this family pet), should have something of its dark nature mentioned in the trailors. I was just not expecting what I got."
1,The royal bores!,"My wife and I attempted to sit through this movie with the best intentions. I should point out that my taste in humor runs to the Monty Python school of both silliness and cerebral humor, and I also enjoy ""quriky"" humor, while my wife tends to prefer physical silliness and in-your-face yuks (more of the latter-day Satureday nite brand of humor). We watched the first hour of this movie and neither of us laughed, neither of us wanted to watch this mess for another minute. What a sad waste of of some very great talent! There is nothing remotely appealing in the characters; in fact, neither my wife nor I cared one iota for any of them. And we could easly do without elongated narration of very boring material. (You know, it's after seeing movies like this that one realizes that for the amount of money wasted making this sort of thing, you could probably feed a small country!)"
1,"Put me to sleep... correction, put me into a coma.","Went out to get a movie one Friday night and they didn't have my 1st, 2nd, or 3rd choices... so I went into ""walk the rows of new releases and look for something interesting"" mode.I rented this movie based on Gene Hackman, Gwyneth Paltro, and Ben Stiller. Even got excited when I realized that they guy that played in the Jackie Chan western was in it. Then saw that Bill Murray and Angelic Huston were also involved and thought this should be great.Wrong.Save your money.I just don't get it."
1,I don't get it.,I don't get it. This is the most confusing attempt at a movie I've ever seen. The plot makes no sense and wastes the skills of several very fine actors.
2,so-so,"The first hour or so is good- quirky and funny (tho the humor is very light- dont expect gut-busting laughs). Hackman is charming and Owen Wilson is playful with his part. However the movie eventually fizzles, and I think part of the problem is with the Paltrow and Luke Wilson characters. I wanted to care about them but they were such cold fish- which wouldnt have been so bad if the relationship had developed some passion in the second half. I also didnt like the Kubrickian pausing-between-lines."
2,A royal disappointment,"The critically-acclaimed Wes Anderson film 'Rushmore' was built with a strong cast, phenomenal soundtrack and a script that made the film roll along with the caffeinated highs and lows of adolescence.'The Royal Tenenbaums' has the same Wes Anderson 'feel' to it and is blessed with a marvelous soundtrack, but TRT trudges along at a snail's pace. The viewer really has to suspend belief throughout the film (which is OK), because every character is outrageously disfunctional and attempts at humor just made me realize how pathetic and unsympathetic Anderson's characters were. The plot was also pretty hard to follow at times, but maybe that was because I was fighting off sleep.In short, the film was too dark and sluggish to be enjoyable. I left Rushmore feeling refreshed. I left TRT half-asleep."
2,Over-rated,"The actor's performances were very good, but the movie is without any reason for being. It's one of those movies that strives to be quirky for the sake of being quirky. Even a screwball comedy needs some sort of believable foundation that one can build upon. This film works backwards, taking a group of people, assigning each with very odd behaviors from the get-go and placing them in manufactured situations. It doesn't make you laugh. It just makes you wonder what's the point?"
1,Just What I Thought,"What happens when you take a whole bunch of funny, great actors, and put them all into one movie? Nothing, Nothing at all...this movie was torture sitting through. I dont think I laughed one time. I even watched it again thinking its one of those ""ya gotta see 2 times"" movies, and nope, I fell asleep. Please dont see this movie, its worse than a early Vin Diesel movie."
5,A simple well made movie,"This is one of those movies that aren't so complicated. It's just a simple funny movie. Some people might get bored by it but I enjoyed it quite a bit. The acting was terrific by everyone. Gene Hackman gave a great performance, Ben Stiller was awesome as always and everyone else was great too. A truly must watch and then buy movie."
5,Deep as can be,This one will be remembered as an American classic. The characters in this quirky dark comedy are very memorable. Ther isn't one dull or forgetable character in the bunch. I particularly enjoyed Luke Wilson's performance as the failed tennis prodigy. He potrays quiet desperation with a master's touch. It seems that his character is the calm center around which all of the craziness whirls around. Gene Hackman's performance is also wonderful. How can a failure of a father return to his family? The movie tries to explore that.
1,Royal Tenenbaums,A very dry comedy. Not my type of movie. A 50/50 chance to either love it or not. Take your chances.
1,Aren't audiences supposed to LAUGH,"during comedy films?Oh. I guess this wasn't actually a comedy.While I didn't notice much laughter going on during this movie, I DID see a number of people walk out. That's not typically a good sign.It's not that I don't enjoy ""quirky"" comedies. It's just that I expect to laugh more than twice during a film. The trailer that makes reference to Ben Stiller's character making a fortune as a youngster by breeding ""Dalmatian mice"" was not an indicator of the level of laughs. For me, that scene was the film's comedic highlight.To sum up an already BRIEF review, I'll defer to the reaction of a 7/8-full-theatre. Not once during the movie was dialogue interrupted by laughter. In fact, the only time I remember a more subdued crowd was during ""Schindler's List."""
5,One of my all-time favorites,"I absolutely cherish this movie; I recommend it to people above all other films. I always walk away from it feeling thoughtful, touched and generally warm inside, and not in a cheesy way, either. Usually I tell people to rent a movie before they buy it so they don't waste their money - but this one would not be a waste. It's worth springing for."
1,Save Your Money! Rental and Otherwise!,"I didn't have to pay to watch this tripe (my friend works in a video store and got it for free) and I'm very thankful for that. Yet another movie that critics rave about for some unknown reason even though I saw nothing original nor overly creative about it. Firstly I didn't really get the sense that Royal Tennenbaum had treated his kids all THAT bad; sure he was a jerk about a lot of things, but he was still there unlike some fathers. So I didn't really get the sense that he was the reason his kids turned out to be such failures. Overall I would simply have to say that as a comedy it failed, ditto in the drama department, and I barely made it through the entire thing. Oh and not too sound like a seven year old or anything, but Luke Wilson's character being in love with his sister, even if she is adopted = EW! That was just a little too V.C. Andrews. So please, people, save your money and rent something genuinely quirky!"
2,It's a Royal something....,"This movie was slow and overly contrived. I don't know if it was due to a bad screenplay or bad direction but this movie never really flows. I am a big fan of quirky, off-beat comedies, but this film was a waste of major talent. The actors gave good performances, however this movie is barely worth seeing."
1,Speechless in Sedona,"I gave it my best shot and even listened to the special feature cast interviews trying to find the light of understanding with regard to this dead-pan, dysfunctional and humorless family on leave from their lobotomy farm from hell, except for perhaps Hackman's character, but it wasn't worth it. I found the entire experience mind-numbingly bad, even offensive, and deadening to my few surviving brain cells. Time stands still but not in a good way. You begin to doubt your own normalcy or whether you indeed have a sense of humor yourself. So be forewarned. Even during the special feature interviews the cast members seemed completely out of it and dysfunctional, and they weren't acting. I suggest that people run for their lives rather than subject themselves to this paean to deadpan humor. Awful."
1,Nap Time,This movie was just horrible. I actually turned it off before the end. I am a huge Ben Stiller fan but this movie was such a disappointment. Don't buy it. Don't rent it. Don't watch it.
5,Wes Anderson delivers again!,"After 'Bottle Rocket' and 'Rushmore' you would think Wes Anderson was due for a bomb. His third movie, 'The Royal Tenebaums' proves the odds' makers wrong! Beautiful cinematography, strong writing, and incredible acting (especially Gene Hackman) make for one of the top movies of 2001!"
4,"Entertaining and original film, superb DVD","Like Wes Anderson's Rushmore, this is a witty and stylish comedy drama with a sharp script and an excellent cast at their best, particularly Gene Hackman at his comedic best. The costumes are as colourful as the characters in this film.The whole enterprise has a faintly anarchic and zany feel but repays repeated viewings.The Criterion 2 DVD set is outstanding: a perfect 2.40:1 anamorphic transfer which shows off this colourful movie to superb effect. You won't find a better DVD image-wise than this.On the second DVD are a host of entertaining extras, not quite in the Criterion Rushmore class, but still very enjoyable.All in all a quality DVD package."
2,"Dull, weird for weird's sake","I chuckled a few times, and was moved a little a few times. But most of the time I was just wondering what the point was. I felt this movie was trying to be ""art"" just by being ""different"". It reminded me of AMERICAN BEAUTY and SEX, LIES, AND VIDEOTAPE, which I also found a dull mix of monontonous characters, plot, and weirdness just for the sake of weirdness."
3,Take Aim at the Rich Kids,"I loved ""Rushmore,"" but Wes Anderson squanders some of its best tricks here to tell pretty much the same story from the rich kids' side. The characters seem more like excuses for the soundtrack and the moody Charles Addams-meets-Tim Burton New York he's constructed than people he really cares about. Nearly every scene can be matched to one in ""Rushmore,"" with the latter showing more heart each time. I hope the mainstream attention hasn't hardened Anderson's quirks into cliches--he's a unique talent and I look forward to seeing what his next film brings."
5,wesss andersonnn,"just a fantastic movie. all of the actors---even gwyneth paltrow (!) handled their roles fantastically. gene hackman gave, if not his best, then at least his most interesting portrayal, even the kid actor's were great. full of irony, metaphors, and then just some quirky stuff. it was surreal, almost like a fairy tale. the cinematography was great, very smooth and flowing; matched the theme of the movie. and of course the music was great, lots of velvet underground or nico stuff. definitely buy the soundtrack."
2,PSeudo-intelligent movie,"Trying to make something different, they just made something boring. The plot idea is fine, the acting is good, but the movie just don't take off."
2,A well made movie but so boring predictable story.,"Amazingly slow and predictable one. The director's attention to detail and setup were great as usual. However, there's no point of story. Not amusing. Paltrow underperforms. Highly decorated bright side version of Adams family."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"I was really looking forward to watching this movie on the strength of the casting alone. I've never seen any of the other films written and directed by the same team, so I didn't know what it would be like. The actors do what they can, but the writing seemed disjointed and I just wanted to smack most of the characters and tell them to get a life! Gwyneth Paltrow is one of my favorite actresses, but her character was just too cliched- her adopted father didn't love her so she looked for love from other men (and women in a short scene that was completely pointless) including one of her adopted brothers. This movie did not give the audience any real connection with the characters. I was more upset when the dog died than with what happened to any of the characters. The only reason I gave this movie two stars is because of the cast- and they deserved a better script."
2,Didn't like it,"Didn't like it. Well, but it's just my opinion. I think they tried to hard to shoot some kind of masterpiece, but the final result was not good. Stiller is no in a funny role. The advertising makes you feel this is a funny comedy, but it's moe of a family drama. (a good one, by the way). I just felt misled by the movie advertising art."
2,Like watching standup comedians minus the punchlines,"I really wanted to like this film. I almost always enjoy the actors that were assembled, some of them great humorists. But in this film there is lots of buildup with no punchlines. I don't think I can remember one really funny scene or line.Hackman, Paltrow and Huston chew up the scenary and are always a joy to watch. Ben Stiller and Bill Murray were totally wasted. Luke Wilson was the only one that was given a role in which he could cut loose, yet he doesn't have the comedic ability that Stiller does and could not do much with it.I think the funniest moments were given by Kumar Pallana.Who would have thought that Hackman/Stiller would yield so much fewer laughs than Deniro/Stiller. Not me."
5,Essential Added Reading,"If you ever have a class in American Religious History or Church History it is worth including this even if it's not on the syllabus. It is valuable info overlooked; fully footnoted with plenty of quotes revealing the rest of the story regarding American legends like Beecher, Beecher Stowe, D. L. Moody, et al. If you wonder how people can be abolitionist but during reconstruction flip so that they are more interested in forgiving rebels who've committed treason than justice and advocacy for freedmen, this will help you understand. You will also be exposed to the heroism of whites who went South to live and act redemptively in the face of repudiation and true danger."
4,A little extra homework,"This is a good book to use with homework assignments. My son does a page a day along with his homework and I see a difference in his grades. Great practice for the State Grade Tests. If your child needs to sharpen his basic skills, this is the book."
4,"Good season, but better when Mulder came back","Everyone seem's to have different opinions on this season, not many good ones at that. I admit, I went into this season pretty cynically, I didn't like many episodes that didn't inculude Mulder, and Robert Patrick's character Dogget didn't help my anger of the loss of Mulder any. However, some of the episodes were okay. I think that Robert Patrick did a pretty good job, but I still couldn't ever have respect, or love for him, as I did Mulder, so I never really got into his character until the very end of season nine. I think the season did a total turnover at the end when Mulder returned, that's where I, and I'm assuming a lot more people started tuning in again to see Mulder. I love every episode that he's in. I adore, and love the relationship with Scully and him, so I altogether enjoyed season eight, and I am going to be their the first day this season is released."
2,Ug,"Season 1-7 were amazing. If DD hadn't left the series and they hadn't killed off the syndicate in s7, the Xfiles would have been a phonemeonon that may have even surpassed the length of the Simpsons. Alas, it was not the case and DD left, the syndicate was killed, dogget was introduced, and the series fell apart. What was even more strange was how Chris Carter saw fit to REPLACE mulder with two clear moves. One, Dogget was introduced as the skeptic who's son (sound farmiliar?) was killed mysteriously several years ago. Two, Scully became the believer. Huh? Scully Believer? What Happened? It's an awful show, and the only good episode left was the series finalie, where Mulder, Scully, and THE SMOKING MAN (YEAH! NOW THAT""S THE XFILES THAT I LOVE!) meet and some conclusion is given. Change your channell to ABC and check out ALIAS. It's the new XFILES replacement. (I HEAR THAT AN XFIlES MOVIE 2 IS COMMING OUT... MULDER SCULLY DOGGET)"
1,Bad Karma,"Although the subject matter is important and interesting, this book is a singularly trashy and lopsided account of the Karmapa controversy. And more than a little self serving. Written in the style of a National Enquirer piece, it has all the credibility of G. Gordon Liddy's accounts of Watergate. Mr. Lehnert clearly has a lot of axes to grind but in the end this spiteful work does no one on the planet any good because any truth that it contains is hopelessy tainted by the author's obvious intent to smite the prideful and backward Tibetans and glorify the great white hope - Lama Ole. It's pretty juicy though. I can see why a lot of people might like it."
2,strong bias makes factual account questionable,"Having met many of the main characters in the book, I was interested in finding out more about what really happened during this controversy. Due to the strong bias in the book, I still don't feel that I have a complete picture of what really happened during the recognition of the Karampas. I now feel a need to read more from the opposing side in an effort to balance my knowledge of the controversy. The book is a good account from one point of view."
4,Biography Sheds Welcome Light,"Mormon Tabernacle organist Alexander Schreiner may have been heard on national and international radio broadcasts more widely than any organist in history. This highly readable biography serves up details of his early life, training, and the beginning of his stellar career, along with sufficient background about the period to be helpful to those of us too young to have lived through it. Here's hoping the author will soon bring us a second volume chronicling the remainder of Schreiner's extraordinary career!"
1,"Good game, Outrageous Price.","This game is fun. but the price unbelievable. In a bad way. $10 a month, REALLY! Why would I pay $10 a month for this if I could have Xbox live and all of its features for the same. Toontown is fun but for 10 a month it is not worth it. Even $5 a month is kind of pushing it. It should be about $10 for 3 months. Then I'll buy. Until that happens, DON'T PAY ON THIS OVERPRICED GAME. Play Halo, COD, Gears, Battlefield, GTA, Red Dead, and so on. At least your getting your moneys worth."
5,Listen to C.Hroencik,He knows every thing about toontown and sonic click on see al reviews and say YES!
3,Toontown,"THE BEST GAME EVER!!! I love toontown it is so fun I love being a toon and having a house and even a pet 'doodle' Toontown is never ending fun, you have to try it it is my favorite game ever!"
5,Toontown online is great!!!,"I let my 9 yr old try Toontown online for the 3 free days from their website. My son loved it so I bought it for him, now I have tried it and play more than him. Even my 3 yr old has his own character he can play. Our whole family plays this game. For each account you get up to six characters. Although only one can be logged in at a time. I know players that have muliple accounts for their family so they can play at the same time. Get this game you'll love it."
4,Three jazz giants spin gold,"First, based on the samplings of this disk, it's NOT the Jack Sheldon, Irene Kral production, it's the trio and it's great. No vocals, just rhythm and 2nds and 7ths that never get old."
4,a fun fair lady,HEY...if you dig jack sheldon & irene kraul youre going to dig this CD. great arrangements and vocals...very much like their porgy & bess album. a fun fair lady.
2,Script needed serious rewrite,Rented on published reviews. Should have known better. Was really looking forward to scenes of Moscow BUT not enough Moscow and script??? If it had been editted some maybe. Started and stopped several times. Acting 90& ok. Not enough action for men only. Not enough computer hacking to appeal to geeks. Not enough romance to appeal to women. ???? Don't bother with this one. Not recommended.
5,Bonus - learned about martial arts AND writing,"When I first saw the title of this book I thought, ""huh?"" I didn't know what a dojo was or how it related to writers. Okay, now I know. I was intrigued throughout the book about how the author weaved martial arts lessons with writing advice. It's a philosophy book, not a ""how to"" book, and I learned about the writing craft and business from examples that were not just writing related.The lessons apply to life, as well as to writing, so the book need not be for writers only. The author illustrated the book with examples relating to her own martial arts experience as well as her writing experience (and of course, the experience of others).It's an easy book to read - each chapter is only a few pages. You can read straight through or skip around.Some of my favorite lessons were `Be open to what happens next' and `The way is not always straight.' The advice was sensible and presented in a `can do' way."
3,Oprah's influence on Middle Eastern women,"An interesting look at middle eastern life through the eyes of a taxi driver and his relationship with his wife is described in a new book- Bahrabian Bacchanal- The Untold Story about Arabia, by Abu Mohammed."
3,Livre gris,"Especially in the early going, the book suffers from cloyingly pretentious prose and laborious plot summary, but eventually Christopher gets around to saying some interesting things about the genre. The book is a perfectly imperfect illustration of the difficulty in finding a middle ground between academic and popular writing. Still, worth having if only for the extensive filmography."
5,ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES!,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and the seller sent the product in a very timely fashion and unharmed. Thank you!
4,Fast Shipment. Love it!,"Love the movie. The box was broken when I received it, not sure if that was how it was shipped or happened in the mailing process"
3,Great Movie,"I've been looking for a copy of this movie for 2 years now. I'm so happy to learn it has a sequel! If you know a movie doesn't have to be disgusting to be funny and love zany romantic comedies and/or musicals, you'll enjoy ""On Moonlight Bay"". Sure, the ending is predictable, but there are plenty of surprises along the way. If you liked ""Tammy and the Bachelor"", you will like this movie equally well (if not more). It's my opinion that this movie is funnier and attracts a wider audience than ""Tammy""."
1,Low Point of the Series,"This is a 'flashback' episode where clips from previous episodes are used. To do this, the writers have Riker be attacked by some vicious plant which leaves a thorn in him. The poison attacks his brain which causes the flashbacks. While it is a bad episode, I will purchase it just to complete my collection!"
5,A must for every kindergarten and first grade classroom.,"Leo Lionni captures every child's attention in his story about the alphabet tree. Learning the written language can seem overwhelming to a small child, but the The Alphabet Tree helps my students understand the writing process. It gives every child the confidence to become a writer."
3,This Movie Is OK,"The really negative reviews are unbalanced and overly harsh. While this film lacks a lot -- centers too much on one character, has a non-ending, and is repetitive of other flicks -- it still entertains. It will especially provide entertainment for those people who take it for what it is: a moderately scary thriller that covers familiar ground. If you are expecting much more, then watch something else."
2,Dirty,Before people shipped these dvds off they really need to learn to get a good look at them before they send them off. It was filty. DvD skipped. I have been a customer with Amazon for a while and never had problems... now I starting to get crapping service.
3,"Good material, but horrible writing","This book has been more or less self-published, and it shows. The author desperately needed an editor. Now, the reader is left to navigate the poor word choices, bizarre sentence structures, and awful use (or lack) of commas and other necessary punctuation.All that being said, I doubt anyone who is looking at this expects it to be a literary masterpiece. Instead, one is probably interested in the book for insight into the cruising lifestyle and the adventure of a long Pacific passage. The book will certainly not disappoint in this regard.Still, this would not be the first book on the subject I would read. Only after one has read many of the other classics and some of the more recent contributions to the genre should anyone be tempted to pick up this book. The material is great, but the presentation is painful."
2,Difficult to read and the ending ruins it.,"Suffered through this book because it is a ""classic"". This ""classic"" took me 3 weeks to read and was so not worth the time spent. At best you get an incomplete view of most of the characters. The ending was so random and incomplete, I wasn't sure if I was missing a chapter at the end. Usually when you read a book that is as hard to read as this one is, you expect to get some great life lesson out of it. I'm not sure what, if anything, I learned from this book. Except maybe that too much kindness will make you crazy. No thanks!"
1,Two CD set with the same songs on both CDs. Defective CD,"I would not advise anyone to buy this CD. The CD would be fine if it were as advertised. The quality is ok and the tracks are fun to compare the vocal stylings of Marilyn and Jayne. BUT the CD has two CDs with the same tracks on both CDs, even though one is factory labeled CD ONE, and the other is factory labeled CD TWO. So, you do not get half the songs advertised on the jewel case. When I contacted the seller, his reply was to send it back at my expense for a refund of the CD cost only. I would not advise anyone to buy this CD, it appears to be mislabeled and a factory mistake."
1,Poor storyline. Sub-par film.,"I have always been intrigued with the notion of the Loch Ness Monster, not to say that I believe in it; however, fictional and real analysis have always fascinated me. That said, the plot of this film is poor. The acting could certainly be better. It's entirely too long. Hard to follow at times. It's just there. It doesn't really elicit any actual emotion in the viewer. If you don't have to pay to watch it and are desperate for something to watch or only want something to run in the background, perhaps; however, I cannot recommend it."
1,"Wish I could rate this less than ""1""...","I could only stand for about 15 mins of this, then had to shut it off. The locations looked absolutely nothing like Scotland... The acting was awful... The accents were Irish (the actors did not know how to do a Scottish accent)...I could go on longer, but the movie was not worth taking the time to do so. I am Scottish, was born there before moving to CA, have the accent, know the Loch Ness area. This movie is a disgrace. Wish I could rate it less than a ""1""."
5,NIV bible dic,It is a great tool. I use it with my bible. I wish the print could have been a little larger.
5,Necessary Understanding,"Yes, this is a great added study guide to understanding the Word of God. I thank you for the prompt delivery. May you have a Happy New Year!"
4,NIV Compact Dictionary,"It was fine. I didn't find the word I needed, but did use it for other references. That is it."
3,Let's not get carried away...,"It's a great show, don't get me wrong. I have fond memories of this show growing up.Trust me though---it's not as good as you remember.Is it bad? Not at all.Most importantly, if you're like me, and you worry that all your kid is left with these days is friggin' ""Yugi-Oh"" or whatever the hell kind of dribble is falling out of Japan these days...then this DVD set is perfect.You can insure that the ""Animaniacs"" legacy will live on, so that when your kids are grown, they will buy the box set of ""Animaniacs"" on virtual reality discs, and be just a little disappointed."
4,The Keepers of The Zaniness,"Quality Cartoons are sadly a thing of the past. Today's youth suffer the misfortune of cartoons that are sarcastic, ugly, and ""supposedly hip"".Animaniacs was one of the last of the ""classic"" cartoons which carried on in the tradition of looney tunes, disney and a dash of The Simpsons (without overdoing it). The actual animation is round and curvy, as compared to the jagged straight style of today, and the characters are classically insane. The ensemble cast gives a great format to the show, mixing it up enough to keep your interest no matter which cartoon team is the focus of each episode (although the Warners appear in every episode, but that is a good thing!).The DVD release contains everything I need, being a pristine collection of the first volume of episodes. The special features are limited but really, it's the show you want, so that's what counts."
1,DESCRIPTION NOT ACCURATE,"The item description states that this item is about 4 x 5 inches. In reality the width is more lik 1.5"" and the heigh is closer to 2"". Maybe people who work with models more would know this, but I didn't - it also does not come painted white. It comes in a solid silver metalic color."
3,Too many details,"Kudos to the author for incorporating an interesting main character who is a woman of color and not succumbing to the token ""proud"" African American woman who gets one page of text. I also found the details about the music business, furnaces, Al-non and amplifiers interesting but felt the daily life details such as ""she put her wallet on the bumper of the truck.....she picked her wallet up"" were annoying. I can't figure out if the author's editor quit or if the author was being paid by the word, but the book could have been cut in half. Sorry, but I found the book easy to put down on a regular basis."
1,Dressler's clever scheme,"The book is fairly useful because it presents readers with a great amount of black letter law. It made me wonder why Dressler's textbook is such an awful and confusing mess of babble. Then, it finally hit me. Dressler simultaenously churns out impossible-to-understand criminal law textbooks that law students are forced to buy, thereby creating a market for black letter law guides and hornbooks. Then, Dressler creates these black letter law guides and hornbooks as an antidote to his shoddy textbook! Ingenius.Honestly, there are better books out there to help you with criminal law. I find the nutshell series to be more helpful than Dressler. The Emanuel and Gilbert outlines are also better. After producing his horrible ""Cases and Materials on Criminal Law"" textbook for 1Ls, which seems to be intentionally confusing, Dressler doesn't deserve to sell any of his study-aids."
4,"Not as good as other S&S CDs, coverage limited","Prof. Dressler is decent to listen to, but the overview given was too narrow in scope to be of much use in my Crim Law class. My professor was much more concerned with all the areas of Crim Law that are different from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. These CDs just give the basics."
3,"yeah, its good...","its a good bottle compared to most generic ones that are cheap...so far I have used this for about a year. great for nighttime to keep you toasty warm during the summer.a couple issues i'm having:*A couple weeks after i received it, a deep yellowing of the material started to develop and I dont know how to get rid of it. Ive used vinegar and it helps somewhat but not completely.*The inner seam under the neck is starting to peel and I'm afraid that someday it'll completely break open.UPDATE as of 2013: shortly after I wrote this review, a hole appeared at the neck so I do not use it anymore. Only had it for a lil over a year."
4,Does its job,"Ive only used this item twice but I like it. I just put regular hot tap water and it stayed warm for 2-3 hours. It was so comforting I slept an extra couple of hours that morning. Nice size, clear so you can see how much water to fill it, and keeps warm. Like it."
3,Disappointed - still shopping for one as good as my old one....,"After 10 plus years my red rubber hot water bottle finally sprang a tiny leak, and I couldn't find a replacement at local stores. This new bottle was expensive, but promised to be even better than the old one. Alas, it is NOT.PROS - It's pretty, it doesn't smell, & it's transparent so you can see the water level as you fill it.CONS - NOT HOT: nowhere near as warm as my old one & does NOT hold heat as long as my old one. I have to keep replacing the cooled water frequently.CAPACITY: flat as an envelope at the side seams, so it held less than 1.5 qts (not the 2 qts claimed, and not the 2.5 my old ""2 qt"" one held) - but after a week the seams had relaxed so it now tops up at exactly 2 qts.I fill it 100% - although it is stamped ""fill not more than 2/3 full"", which would be only 1 1/3 qts, and would make the lack of heat retention even worse.STILL SHOPPING, but afraid of ""awful smell"" reviews for red rubber bottles."
5,Warm and Cozy. The BEST hot water bottle!,"This is by far the best hot water bottle I've ever had. It is only very slightly smaller than the ones I'm used to. I read some reviews about it, claiming that it was unusually small, but I keep thinking those people may have mistakenly ordered the ""child size"" hot water bottle this company also makes.) I have found the size of the hot water bottle to be great. The material is much thicker and more durable than cheaper ones and gives off a gentle, permeating heat that lasts a very, very long time. It seems like a very safe design. (I once had one of the cheaper brands split all apart down a front panel. Thankfully the water was not too hot at this point.) This water bottle is fantastic overall. I have actually ordered two and may also give them as gifts. If you are cold in the winter, snuggle up to one of these and safe on heating fuel! It really is the best!!!!"
1,Too small -- cookies would look like blobs,"I should have read the other reviews first. These are so small that, for most cookies, they would not retain the shapes. These are probably not the cookie cutters you are thinking of when you look at the picture."
5,Utterly breathtaking and a history lover's delight!,"""The Feast of Roses"" was a truly captivating novel filled with royal intrigue, love, passion and the mysterious world of seventeenth century India. It is definately a book for those who love history, romance and literature. Ms. Sundaresan's description of the love story between Emperor Jahangir and Mehrunissa, (known in history as Nur Jahan) keeps the reader wanting to know more and more as the book goes on. The novel is filled with colorful descriptions of the palaces, people and the time they lived in as well as capturing the human nature of each character. A great book to read no matter what kind of day!!! Two thumbs up!!!!!!"
5,It's Not About the Horse-It's About Overcoming Fear and Self-Doubt,This was a very inspiring book to read. After reading it really made me take a good look at myself!!!
2,Some bad language in book,"I was thinking about buying the book, until I looked inside to research it, and found some inappropriate words, that I don't think belong in there. The f word turned me off right away, and I didn't go any further. Surely there could have been better word choices."
5,Thirty Years That Changed the World- A message for Today,"This book is a fascinating exposition of the Book of Acts as well as a very practical application guide for those who are hoping to revive the intensity of today's Christianity. Written by an Oxford scholar, it is not pedantic, but is a very serious study of the first century church and the growth of Christendom. It is full of information and insights into today's problems facing the church, particularly the dilemma of the burden of buildings to church advancement today.I found it relatively slow reading because there is so much to ponder in each chapter. It would make a great study book for individuals or groups. Thirty Years That Changed the World makes me want to read more by Michael Green."
1,These shoes suck,"I bought these shoes with high expectations. I had heard great things about them. I purchased these shoes in March 2012, and they lasted until around July 2012. I still wear them, but they are almost no longer wearable. The soles are almost completely worn dorn. I won't be purchasing this brand again."
1,Deer stage shoes fell apart in 3 months,"My deer stage shoes fell apart in 3 months, I work in a office with a carpet floor and the tops unglued from the bottom. They where very comfortable while they lasted. Will never by again!"
5,Great shoes!,"My husband finds these shoes to be Super Comfortable, very appropriate for work, and a great value!"
5,Interesting thoughts,Very interesting even if you do not work in the medical field. It is entertaining and very thoughtfully written and read.
5,Better - truly a better way to perform medicine,I have truly enjoyed reading this book and find the book a very refreshing look at medicine. I appreciate that Dr. Gawande was as unbiased in his approach to the book. As a practicing anesthesiologist I am always lookIng for ways to improve myself and I think that is the focus of this book. Thanks for such a wonderful book.
5,Awesome,I really enjoyed this book and found it both interesting and helpful as I look for quality in my work and in my life.
4,"Good, but not better than Complications","A follow up to Gawande's earlier ""Complications."" This is a good, quick read, but it lacks some of the depth that the earlier parts of ""Complications"" had. Still, a worthwhile book."
3,better...should have been Better,"Disappointing outing for this usually wonderful author.Granted he does not try to hide from the blemishes of the surgical world but the book at times went on and on and became boring.I do believe that he is a brave man to write the types of books and articlesthat he does write, as the medical profession is a closed society.I understand his need to try to make medicine better but is this the way to do it? we'll never really know."
1,A BITTER disappointment,"I bought this book because I'm a long time fan of Amanda Quick's novels. I have readily shelled out the cash for them in the past but never before have I felt that my money would have been better spent on ANYTHING else!! I'm not saying that I'll never read her books again, I'm just saying that her name is no longer at the top of my favorite author list. Her heroine was incredibly annoying and I found myself just wishing they would find the stupid rings so I could get on to reading a GOOD book. If I could I wouldn't even give this book ONE star. BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME,AMANDA!!"
4,Great for camping,"Collapses well, assembles easily and good construction.Height is not adjustable but feels about normal height for most uses.The top of the pole is offset to keep the center of gravity in line with the base. So it feels stable.The lamp reflector comes flat and you will need to bend it in a curve. It easily detaches and we didn't use it.Also our coleman propane lamp which has a long U handle barely clears the pole.For its price its a great item to have around a campsite."
3,War of the Buttons,"I watched this as part of a school project, it was sometimes funny but tackles war but the voilence is more child-like than anything else . The war between the Carricks and the Ballys is entertaining and tackles issus such as conflict, rivalry, frienship and childhood. The boys give a funny perspective on war and overall its a good watch!"
5,Great Irish Fun,"The video I purchased was used, but in perfect condition. This is a well-told story of growing up in the Ireland of several decades ago, and is both hilarious and touching. Well-suited for older kids and adults. I highly recommend it!"
