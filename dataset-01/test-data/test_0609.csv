5,Comfortable,I chose this type of hat because I didn't feel like going to a hat store in order to figure out my hat size. It's a great one-size-fits-all hat. I've worn it a few times now and it does its job just fine. It's a nice way to show support for my team.
5,First-hand experience,"At least a decade or more ago my wife and I were invited to an intimate outdoor summer evening concert (exactly where I cannot remember, but it was in the Portland area). It didn't much matter who was playing, we thought it sounded fun. But once the small ensemble began to weave their music into the evening air, it was magical. It was Barry and Nora, and we bought their CD, this CD, after they had finished. I've enjoyed their music ever since, and I guarantee if you give them a chance you will enjoy it too."
2,"Worksheets, worksheets, worksheets","I am very disappointed with this book. Instead of offering activities I can use in class, it is primarily a collection of worksheets. Additionally, my copy was bound upside down."
5,Beautiful Imagery,"I don't think some of the past reviewers were seeing the same book that I was. Every image was artfully taken and beautifully illustrative of what it is and how to appreciate Wabi Sabi. Understanding that old and crooked can be more restful and pleasing than new and straight and unblemished is a new and freeing concept to many. This books allows people to explore what they once discarded and to appreciate a new esthetic for their surroundings, in both their home and garden. The colors and textures inspire me every time I open it up for another look."
1,B!+che5,"No-talent posers that sound so whimpy and watered down. Yeah, they like to dress like they're ""soooooo cool and bad"" (lol!), but their music is no different than any lame @55 Nsync or BSB album. Don't worry, GC will be tossed aside in a year or so, just like all the other trendy fads. ""The Young And The Hopeless"" is what their loser fans are. Morons."
1,An utterly unfunny comedy,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Robbie Coltrane must have been desperate at this stage of his career.
2,Sweaty Palms,Excellent book! I used this book when I exited the military to enter industry in 1983 and purchased this book (again) for my two college graduates now seeking their first interviews to find work. This book is well written and passes the test over time as being still current. I recommend this book to all who are preparing for the job interview or for those who are hiring and looking for good interview techniques.
2,Barelty edible,"In the description supplied by the manufacturer it says all natural, but it ontains corn syrup and peservatives. It is too sticky to rtemove from the box. I threw almost all of it away. Not remotelely similar to any baklava Ihave had before, Not recommended.Plase excuse any typos I have a neurologic disease."
4,A must have for philosophy students,"I needed the book Introductory Readings for my philosophy class. The book helps understand the ideals and arguments of Aristotle. It was written especially for students. Introductory Readings was originally in Greek, so the translation done by Hackett Publishing is by far one of the most understandable, since it is hard to translate Greek to English. I would highly recommend picking this up if you want to understand philosophy a bit more, since philosophy is confusing if you easily get lost with philosophical ideas that can just throw you off. However, if you like reading the works of famous philosophers you should not pass this book up."
2,Where's the Magic?,"It seems like the same formula was used for these songs as the songs on the first album ""First One Up"", but somehow the magic eluded them."
5,To kid or not to kid,"My daughter (Emily) is a healthy 7-year-old. I bought her this book, and had a look at it before I gave it to her. I thought it was a little dark, a little bit left of centre, but ultimately harmless. Maybe if you're Ned Flanders from the Simpsons, you would have a moral issue or two. Otherwise, this is fine. Emily loves this book - it appealed to her sense of identity in general - she felt special because of it, that it wasn't something that could be taken on by just anyone unless they too were called Emily. And she hasn't harmed any boy, dog, parent or herself since first reading it a year ago. She remains an upbeat, unique, and happy 7-year-old with a wonderfully skewed take on the world, much like the eponymous Emily the Strange."
5,More than Novelty?,"As a young Adult reader, I firmly contend that Emily: The Strange can be read as more than a mere novelty book. Of course, there is the exceptional graphic and humor level, but, I believe more importantly, it is this wonderful book's (not so subtle) reminder that we all have to settle-just not all the way. Our rebellion can be in the little things, the details of life, something small, like a coffee table book."
5,Best Eligh Album I've heard yet,"This is some of Eligh's best work. The beats are amazing and often crazy, following the true living legends tradition. Great use of uncommon instruments such as a flute on track 2. Great beats, rhymes and message."
1,Beautiful but not accurate,"The first thermometer I received registered about 12 degrees below the actual temperature. The return was easy- UPS picked up the package from my doorstep- and I soon received a second thermometer. It registered about 6 degrees below the actual temperature. I intend to return it and get my money back. The art work is beautiful, but it should be a working thermometer. If you insist on ordering one, test its accuracy by leaving it near the thermostat for your furnace. Furnace thermometers are usually quite accurate. Hopefully Amazon can find a different supplier that makes similar thermometers that are actually useful as thermometers."
5,Great craft!,"My two children played with this for hours. It stimulated their creativity, and worked on fine finger motion. There are plenty of beads and colors to make a lot of different patterns."
3,Disappointed,"This book was recommended to me, but I was disappointed. Although it is a good book, it wasn't great. Perhaps my level of expectation for religious books has risen. The ideas seemed to be too general, although the first part of the book was good."
3,Mustang book review,The book has lots of good information in it. The reason I only give it a 3 star is that most of the pictures are in black and white. I have bought other books about cars that had mostly color pictures and it makes it alot more enjoyable to look at. I have shown friends car books and had them say that was my car and it was that color too. One of the reasons people buy these books is for the memories of cars they had.
4,A CAPTIVATING TALE,"The Lemon Dance is a captivating tale about an intriguing character during turbulent times. Savannah, Georgia is the ideal hub for the many romantically alluring adventures that Reds takes us on. Thanks for the fun, Reds."
5,a true story by a true patriot,"Very few of us ever commit to a bigger than life ideal to the point that we actually attempt it particularly if it requires us to lay it all on the line.""The Lemon Dance"" is a story about one man's commitment to a bigger than life ideal and his attempt to carry it out. It matters not that Reds Helmy's commitment to a bigger than life ideal may have been so intense that it may have temporarily suspended his connection with reality. (which I doubt) What matters is his level of commitment, and the subsiquent effort to carry it out. ""The lemon Dance"" is a true story written by a true patriot."
1,Beautiful but HORRIBLE Quality plus $9.95 per stem shipping replacement,"Where to start... The company claims that the glasses are the most break resistant in the industry. The wine enthusiast website has nothing but good reviews. Interestingly enough I can not seem to write a review on their website. So my order: Two of the three boxes I ordered at Christmas arrived with SHATTERED glasses. The customer service is good. They quickly replaced the broken glasses in time for Christmas. Within the first 3 weeks of use (careful wash by hand use) two more broken glasses. One broke in my mother in law's hand. (I was rather horrified.) So of the 12 glasses that I bought in 6 weeks of use 5 have broken. Now here is the really good part. When you read the fine print, the company is happy to replace the broken glasses for $9.95 a stem."
2,Waste of Money -Don't buy,"I bought one of these to use in my studio. Previously I had owned a couple of M-Audio's Audiophile 2496 PCI cards which are absolutely excellent and one of the best values you can get in pro audio gear, so I expected the same quality from their USB device. Boy was I wrong, this thing is pure junk. The drivers frequently and mysteriously disappear from Windows and have to be manually re-installed. The sound quality is good and latency can be managed to a very low level with a bit of effort and configuration but the device although advertised as a 2496 device really only functions at 2448. They don't tell you that on the box or in the store.M-Audio had become synonymous with quality audio gear, but this product misses the mark by a wide margin. It's no wonder they have discontinued it. Don't waste your money on this. If you are on a budget, get the PCI card instead."
3,Stale but enjoyable mob tale,"This comes from one of the writers of 'The Sopranos,' and it shows. There are real quality lines & a lot of things we've seen before. The performances lift it a little, though, as they are the strongest thing here.Alec Baldwin follows his great turn in 'The Departed' with another strong turn. This is pretty good entertainment, nothing great.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
3,Too much cross-referencing,"I felt the need to commit everything to memory. The history of the brothers, their descriptions, traits, deeds ... Whew! Would that those characters actually had something to do with this story, or at least the same series. I was relieved when Rowena came onto the scene without a blow-by-blow of her and her ladies'-in-waiting entire life stories.Women chase after Stryder like he's a celebrity, the idea of a singing contest in a romance novel (especially w/ the strapping hero to sing?) seemed silly, & the advertisements for the brothers stories; took up much of this one.A little bit of mystery and humor kept me reading. I was disapointed but will not give up on this author. Crossing my fingers that the next one reads better. (Note: we are series romance fans, not cult followers)"
3,Interesting enough,"Fairly interesting. Some side stories from family members & friends some photos that weren't very interesting (photos of everyday objects with no real importance to the story of Elvis). Funny that they focus so much on his spiritual side, considering that they are into the ""Church of Sciencetology"" (or however you spell it). Can't imagine anyone being serious about that group. But it makes me wonder how Elvis would have felt if he'd known about his ex involving his daughter in such a group. I hope on some level these women believe in something other than aliens conjured up by some science - fiction writer. Anyway I just thought it was funny that these two would focus so much on that side of his personality. The book was ok but not as interesting as I thought it would be when I ordered ."
5,"For The First Time, The Inside Story by Elvis's Family","Elvis's wife, daughter, and others in the immediate family tell the story of Elvis Presley from the inside looking out. It is very interesting to have this new perspective on the life of Elvis Presley. In addition, there are some wonderful photos included in the book. Enjoy!"
5,Great Mailbox.,"Fast delivery, and easy to put together. It looks great and I really like the two doors. We can get the mail from the back of the box, and thissaves going out into the street and over the curb. I would highly recommend this product. The box is sturdy too."
4,very nice looking,"This mail box looks good and was very easy to install, the only issue is the inside of the box is narrower in the middle so the mail must bend some to fit."
2,Keystone cops (Americans) wage war.,"Derek is British by way of Australia. In this book, he makes the Americans look like idiots waging war. If you read this book, be prepared to see Americans killing Americanc, VC killing Americans, and the wonderful North Vietnamese killing Americans. Since this book came out in 1970, it was understandabe why Derek would be anti-war. The history of the war is a little different. The kill ratio of Vietnamese to Americans were very different, and the North Vietamese were not angels. The humor is OK, but this was a tragic war. I did like the rivalry between Marines and Army."
1,not much on it for one player,"I love the original Touchmaster game and thought that this one might be just as good but there is very little on here for one player. So I am stuck with just playing solitaire. I also found the other games on here to be expecially hard to figure out. Maybe I am just too ""old"" for this stuff! Anybody out there have a game they can recommend that is as good and varied as Touchmaster????"
5,Great set of games to play with a friend,I had a friend who originally owned this game and we would do two player battles all the time. So when my friend moved away I was forced to buy it for myself. Still a great game with a variety of games to play and the price was also a good reason to get it.
5,Texasabilene,"The item (clubhouse games)is excellent even though used. I have noproblem with it.I do however have a problem with the company Texasabilene. When you are selling a product, you should be professional. We had to wait more than double the time because we were sent a game case with nothing in it. It took some time to be sent the game finally and we are also in Texas."
3,Horrible Chess Engine,"My wife got this for me as a Christmas present, almost solely because I kept saying I wanted a chess program for the DS. I have to say, the chess program is horrible. I can easily beat it on the hardest (of three) settings. It doesn't appear to use an opening library, or if it does, that library consists of sacrificing the queen as early as possible (I'm not kidding about that). It takes forever to decide on a move, then it does something completely inexplicable (like instead of moving a dangling piece out of harms way, it will move another piece to a meaningless square).I will say that the rest of the games (at least the ones I've played) seem good enough to distract me while I'm on the bus. My wife and I have also played some of them together over the wireless connection, and that was fun."
1,Poor construction,Purchased the ground mount to fly the England flag for the world cup. Only stayed up for one day then broke. Not worth the money.
3,Gonzo wanna be,"The best way to enjoy this book is to pass over the wanna be Gonzo writers chapters and read the interviews. I found Ms. Carroll's writing to be quite boring and made no sense. I passed these chapters, that she wrote, and found the interviews, with friends and co-workers, a true look into Hunter's life, zaney as it was."
1,Horrible,I like watching Independent Films but this was just crappy. Cinematography sucked...storyline made a mockery of Catholicism. Even the sound sucked. You could barely hear the people! Waste of the 1.95 I paid for it.
2,Barrio possession?,I thought this was fairly interesting but it is like some Mexican American exorcist type of movie without the great special effects. It is definitely strange and at times boring but someone out there might like this kind of movie.
5,Creative playtime!,"Bought this for my three and a half year old niece who spends weekends at my house. She totally loves playing with all the different colors and cutouts. I gave her a few paper plates to put her cutouts on, and that spurs her imagination even more. The table top is perfect for her, and she loves cleaning up after since everything fits right back in the box."
4,Good exercise....fun to do with your kid,"This game is a great concept! Exercise and fun with your kid. However, the picture is not very clear, very low-end pixels. THe games are fun, my son is 4 and can do most of them."
3,a little too advanced for our 2 year old,"Our little guy hasn't taken to this yet.I will re-introduce the toy again after a little time but right now, it is a little too advanced for my 2 year old.I think it is a great value for the money-you get a lot-and hope he will play with it later.I love how everything is self contained"
5,stacks,"Fun game that people of all ages can play. Anyone who can count to six can play, but older players can enjoy it on a different level when they get into the ""strategy"" of the game. It's easy to throw this game in a backpack to take on hiking trip, to camp, etc."
1,where is it?,"Ordered it months ago and have yet to receive it. Terrible processing time, still hope it comes....."
2,VERY Disappointing!,Thea's twelve DVDs are merely a collection of smaller sets of DVDs put together. I was so disappointed as I began viewing and realizes I owned all the subsets separately..
4,What a Soap Opera,"Other reviewers have focused on 19th century France, culture, power structure, etc. But let me tell you, this is just one hell of a soap opera. Julien, Mathilde, and Mm. Renal must have either read ""The Rules""-or perhaps they invented them. A remarkably modern take on male-female behavior, especially when both parties are ""interested"" but want to play ""hard to get"".This book was a lot of fun and the ability to learn about a time and place different from my own was a bonus."
4,Pretty good but a bit less romance than the others,"Despite the criticisms offered by others, I quite liked this book. I do agree there was less romance in this book of the series and the heroine was a bit ""blah"" but I basically liked Robbie's story and the intertwining of the other characters from the other 3 books. And just enough magic to keep it interesting. I particularly liked the candle lighting incident at the end of the book caused by their spontaneous erotic combustion. It certainly made me giggle a bit!I don't think it was the best of the series but it was still a very enjoyable book altho I suspect I wouldn't have liked it as much if I hadn't read the other books first."
3,Kind of Disappointing...,"Only if you're familiar with this series can one enjoy this book. It is so much about ALL the characters - of which there are many - and less about Robbie and Catherine, especially the first half. There's little interaction between these two in the beginning, which kind of made for a boring tale, but since I was familiar with Robbie, I stuck with it. It did get better, but it wasn't as good as his father Michael's story."
4,nice mailbox,This is a very nice mailbox. It is roomy and is all in one piece so it was easy to install. We live at the beach and salt air is an issue so this mailbox being plastic will not rust as others have. It is also cute.
1,Dissatisfied customer,Barbecue Thermometer & CaseI only recieved one of the two I ordered and I gave that one as a gift. I contacted the offerer but never heard back. Very dissatisfied.
1,Would not recommend this product,"Bought this set for my 4 year old grandson. First time out, the head of the putter fell off. Shipping box had been recycled. Very disappointing. I would rather buy locally at a higher cost with the convenience and ease of returning or exchanging."
5,THAT IS IT!!!!,"This must be the middle-east peace!!!! ..Wonderful ethnic music performance from Israel...Arabic, Turkish,Persian,Indian melodies alltogether..It couldn't be better than this.Especially the percussionist Zohar Fresco shows a splendid musicianship.I would suggest you to listen to all the albums of this band..The albums by Bustan Abraham named as Hamsa ,Fanar,Ashra are also very good..They also appeared with very different musicians from all over the world.Such as Ross Daly(with him they have an album called Abadai..excellent!!!!!),Hariprasad Charusia."
5,Very Useful Device,"This is an excellent device to have at work. I am used to spending several hours per day at conference calls, so that for anyone takes part of it without the limits posed for an ordinary telephone is priceless, at least for me.Its audio quality as well as its range is amazing.All in all, I can say I'm satisfied with this purchaseMagno Souza,Salvador/BA - Brazil."
2,cheap and poor everything else.,"I didn't hate it but 2 things stand out, I threw it away, and I'm not sure I even watched all. I have several fight movies; most with Jet Lee and Jackie Chan. I can't stand Segal and and only have one Van Dammed; Legionnaire; so you can see I am not much into fighting movies. This one joined that rank."
4,The Perfect Weapon,"I thought it was a good movie, it came out in the early 1990s' I've always liked Jeff Speakman, and wanted this one for my own Martial Arts movie collection. It took some time before it came out on DVD, I had actually e-mailed Jeff Speakman directlyabout it, their seem to had been an issue with Paramount studios at the time. I guess that's why Jeff went the straight to DVD route. I would recommend renting it, unless you want to add to your personal collection."
1,Needs improvement,"Obviously shot very low budget. Guessing Digital SLR was used because film is really choppy. Editing was more of a show reel style of editing than movie editing. There was some inconsistancies in the film scences like she had her coat than then didn't. Lighting was decent but could have been better. Script developement really needed some work, they didn't build the story enough to really forfill viewer need for aniticipation and forfillment when climax was reached. It jumped to quickly to Resolution at climax without really telling us how she felt, showing us the moment she knew she had the part and her emotions reguarding that. Also completely left out mothers reaction which was part of the story line, verses fathers reaction and the conflict associated with that. Actors might have had talent but were not directed well and were working with subpar script. All and all potential was there for great story, but needed better vision in telling the story."
4,Life 101 is a Hard Price to Pay.,"Ms. Jackson has written an excellent account of her life's trials and tribulations thus far. She is empowering her reader's with her words. You can think of Ms. Jackson as a spirtual cheerleader. I loved Chapters 6 thru 10. I felt Ms. Jackson finally let the real person be seen and sent her lawyer, administrator, educator, etc. personas to rest for awhile inorder to allow her readers to understand the point she would drive home; ""Everything has a price, but what are you willing to pay for it?"" The only shortcomings about the book are the many people and activities mentioned. One would need a cheat sheet to keep up with the many people and functions that have helped Ms. Jackson to become the person she is today. They were instrumental in showing the plot detail, but made it difficult to follow at times. Keep motivating perpetual procrastinators such as myself! I look forward to your next literary work."
5,These are awesome,Thse are one of my most favorite munchies! Nothing but to healthy stuff in there. Better than generic boring granola!
1,Made in China,"I was a Mrs. May's regular for years. I ordered a case of their cashew crunch directly from them and it arrived in a box that said: Made in China. I wrote them and, to give them credit, unlike most American companies today, they responded honestly and without the typical excuses. They told me they'd produced their products in China for years with no problems. My dogs were affected by the Chinese dog food poisoning incident and I did not want to subject my family to the possibility of tainted food purchased in the belief I was giving them something healthy. Also, the fuel used to ship these from China to the U.S. makes them less than viable candidates for sustainability. I already work very hard to ensure than things purchased on Amazon come from areas near my home."
3,Great taste but comes from China,"It would give 5 stars if it had not come from China. I was disappointed, I expected this type of product to be from the USA. The product tastes fine."
5,Music Video DVD,"Great, loved it as much as seeing the concert, he is a great entertainer, plus bringing in other musicians that are remarkable. JUST GREAT"
5,Sink the Bismarck,Detailed waterline model. Great detail on it all. Came with paint suggestions that helps. I would suggest this be in display case. Does have parts that are easily broken off. Love the paper that comes with it with short history lesson about it.
3,pretty but pricey,"These ""stones"" are very pretty and easy to install. However after i purchased and installed them I found an almost identical product at walmart for only $16 per 10'"
3,good overview of the mainstream literature,"This is an excellent survey of the mainstream psychology of music, from the neurology of the ear to the psychology of composing. There is a wealth of information about the perception and cognition of musical sound. However, as others have noted, Jourdain really doesn't deliver on the ""ecstasy"" in his title. To some extent that is a limitation of the research base he draws on, which is weak on emotion and almost completely silent on ecstasy. However, quite a bit of anecdotal evidence is available, but Jourdain doesn't review it."
4,Excellent musicology and neuroscience. Amazing insights.,"Robert Jourdain writes effortlessly about the latest research in neuroscience and the most scholarly musicology, combining the two into fascinating insights about how we relate to music, and how music is itself shaped by our special abilities and limitations. An ""Aha!"" on almost every page."
1,"""Music, The Brain, And Ecstasy""=""Science, Science, Science""","Robert Jourdain's ""Music, The Brain, And Ecstasy"" is not a book to read for enjoyment, it is rather a book to read for information. It is a textbook containing the physics of sound waves, the biology of the brain, and the psychology of music. The word music does not even belong in the title. The word music implies enjoyment. Robert Jourdain provides no enjoyment in the book whatsoever. He overloads the reader with far too much information, even for someone as interested in science as me. Jourdain is also closed minded on the subject of music. He thinks that the only good music is classical music, and while he does not state this directly, its implication is very strong. Jourdain doesn't even mention any other styles of music other than classical. If a writer wants to discuss music, shouldn't he discuss the various styles of music? All in all, Robert Jourdain's misleading title and prejudice in music make for a very poor book."
2,Nation sells your subscription information,"The Nation is a good magazine, but they sell your subscription information and you will be flooded with all sorts of junk mail. Even if you tell them not to release your personal information you will notice an increase in junk mail after you subscribe to The Nation."
1,"THEY WON'T DELIVER PRINT ISSUE, EVEN IF YOU PAY FOR IT...","It has become clear to me that The Nation would just rather send their electronic version to your computer. I have tried twice to order a print version of this magazine, which you could carry and read anywhere. The first time I became so discouraged that I cancelled the subscription. I tried a second time - don't know why- to order a subscription for my wife's birthday in early September. It is now almost December and I have not received a single subscription and have not received any communication from them about being late or when it might be sent to me. I am going to cancel again. I think I will try the Huffington Post, the print version."
1,SPAM,"The magazine itself is great. They will sell your name, mailing address, and email address to everything though. Not worth it unless you like deleting 3 emails a day and shredding 10 junk letters EVERY DAY! I plan on buying subscriptions for people I don't like.Again, the magazine is awesome. Especially if you enjoy an interesting crossword puzzle."
3,Not the same color,The color of the set I received is not as good as the one in the picture. As if the picture online was altered to make it better while the real one is really pale in color.
3,"Good intro, not exactly ""Mastering""","This book does a terrific job of introducing the basics of Delphi 3. But weighing at over 1000 pages I had thought that there would be a lot more information about the new Delphi technologies like remote BDE and the new Internet stuff, but instead he just adds a comment about the subject being beyond the scope of the book. If you're new to Delphi, it's pretty good, if you're experienced I'd give it a pas"
2,Too many issues covering too little information,The book is almost an identical copy of the previous versions. The author wanted to cover as much issues as he could and therefore the OLE/COM issue has only about 100 pages ( not very good ) and the Tools APIhas ONLY 20 PAAGEA!!!!!!
2,This is not Pure Delphi programming...,"The author, Marco Cantu, his profession is mostly in C/C++. In this book, several techniques he used are very into C/C++ or does not belong to Pascal at all. In the examples introduced in this book he solved most of the problems by accessing Windows API functions instead of Delphi's built-in procedures and functions. This creates a cloud over the reader's head since the author jumps around among C/C++, Pascal, and Windows API functions. The author also did not go into depth in Delphi Internet Programming (he only used one chapter to give an overview of this important part of the Delphi programming), and hence is not ""Mastering Delphi."" I suggest the readers who want to learn Delphi read books written in pure pascal codes first, then go further into the Windows API functions later."
1,WORD PERFECT 11 FOR DUMMIES,"Very basic beginning Word Perfect -- very little, if any, information about new features of WP 11 and how to use them."
2,I can't believe the series ended this way...,"i remember being devoted to Cooney's Time series some years ago, and religiously tracked down the first 3 books. A few weeks back, my friend came across the fourth book, For All Time, and i was ecstatic, for i wasn't aware of its existence. The book was fun and engaging, however, the ending was rushed and an extreme disappointment. For years i was committed to the Time series, and to see it end the way it did made me feel as though i have been wasting my time. I won't give away the ending, however, i fear that devoted Time readers will be left feeling as though not reading the series would have been more agreeable."
4,Cheap extra flash works with preflash cameras,"This flash does what it says. Works with my DSLR, which has a preflash that fools most slave flashes into going off prematurely, but not this one. Very cheap for what it does. Very bright, but not adjustable in brightness, so I do that by covering up part of it or putting a diffuser in front of it, or placing it further away from subject. Very cheap way to get enough flashes for background & hair lights to supplement on camera flashes."
2,Techno nightmare,"I love this D.J. But this album has me wondering what he was thinkging. It has great intro's and background fusion but then there is this (Rabbit thumpin, spaz arobics, Techno beat) mixed in that ruins 80% of the songs. It is horrible like the way Techno used to sound when it first came out bad bad bad!. I tried to love this CD because everything else I have by this artist I love. I think he made this as a joke, it just has to be a joke it's that bad. I threw it out my car window after trying to like it five plays later, I dont know how much caffine he must have had before creating this but I am surprised it did not kill him.I hope anything after this CD that this artist makes is absolutley not like ""Near Eastern Lounge"" There is nothing ""LOUNGE"" about it. I only gave it two stars because He is an amazing artist with the sad exception of this one CD, This CD sould not even be rated."
4,Must be heard to be appreciated,you first must be able to appreciate all knids of musicThen u have to understand that world music is a collection of all special types of genres in one from the relaxing to the funkyall types including oriental asian egyptian african etc.........so when u listen to any world music compilation keep an open mindu will be amazed this is a very good CDbuy it.............World music ConnoisseurWorld music lounge owner (BUDDHA lounge)Entertainment ConsultantKOE.
2,Not over Joyed,"After correcting a few (3) problems with the printer I finally got it to workDuring the time it took me to get it to print,The seller canceled my requestto return it.His reason.. He claims my request was a DUPLICATE. strange as this is the 1st time I have purchased anything fron Amazon or this seller.one e mail told me to print all of the items required to return the printer,I ask for help as I had not got the printer to work yet NO RESPONSEI Guess alls well that ends well............. ?? Not Really"
2,depth slips in use,"I'm not sure what the other people doing reviews are using this router for, but it must be stuff that requires zero accuracy. The depth of cut will slip deeper as you use the router, and can really mess up the work you're routing. Perhaps that's why they're selling so cheap... I've tightened the locking clip to the point that the base won't hardly move at all, and it will still slip if I don't constantly monitor it. I'm very disappointed with this Bosch product, which is a new thing for me."
3,OK but Only Average At Best,"Given the higher than normal rating (4.5 stars) by the watchers, I thought I give this movie a watch, but I'm disappointed to say it was only an average movie at best. The acting was decent given the very short and unimaginative story, but it was certainly not worth watching before it's theatrical release, which will certainly be short-lived before it gets put out to the Redbox dollar rental kiosks within weeks if not days."
3,"They only ship one, not ten FYI.",If you're looking for 10 drives for that price you'll be disappointed. Amazon is only shipping one drive for that price...even though it says BULK 10PK.
4,Great Set!,"Corelle is the best manufacturer of dinnerware I have found. If you want light weight dinnerware that can withstand the heat of your oven up to 350 degrees and be shatter resistant, this is manufacturer for you. I love the design as well."
3,not very happy,"i was disappointed to see that the mugs are not corelle,but were made of stone ....they broke after few months(all of them)... plates were corelle material and impressive but when i looked closely all the plates had an elevated point,like a boil when you trace the plate...i mean the finishing at edges were not proper...anyway that was not much problem but the mugs were really unacceptable..i could get corelle mugs with plates from corelle factory and would not have to pay $9 for shipping.....i payed 38 dollars in total..."
5,Urban Red -Love It!!,We have alot of dinner guests and everyone has commented how modern and fresh looking our new corelle is - we love it!!
4,light weight,We had some nice dinner ware but just to heavy for every day use. This set is great not at all heavy and cleans up easy.
1,did not get 3 set of dinnerware !,"I buy 3 sets of the corelle dinnerware, a paid it, and I only recieve 1 set.they can check out the UPS order and see the weightI don't know to contact the seller"
2,They are cute but....,"I think they are cute but their heads are huge and so are their feet.Their heads are bigger then the my scene dolls.My daughter does not have too many of the my scene dolls so the ""wee 3 friends"" dolls are monstrous compared to her Barbie's. I don't understand why Mattel made them that way."
3,Hello,"I am the person that wrote the ""Wee 3 friends WAY better than Bratz"" review. Now i think, compared to Bratz these dolls are NOTHING. I LOVE Bratz now. Bratz are cool. Flash Back fever Jade is awsome. I recomsider my first review. I am 12 years old.These dolls are nice yet boaring. Bratz are much more entertaining. I agree with the person who doesn't like wee 3 friends they are only 8 years old wearing make up. Bratz rule!"
2,Brackets,The brackets are not at a 90 degree angle. If you build anything to the correct degree this product with not work unless you do a lot of fudging.
4,"Love the Color, Can't wait for Year 3, But...","Besides no commentary (perhaps R.C. is unavailable/unwilling, most others are dead), there is no theme song variation while in the Root Menu, just dead silence. I liked portions of that music better. It would repeat every minute or two during a snack/pit-stop break.It is amazing how this triggers the long-term memory in the brain. Portions of shows that I have not seen in 40 years triggered my recollection of what was about to happen, while not a conscious thought all this time.Some of the same villains returned as other villains. Robert Drivas never returned, too bad, he was good."
1,Nonplussed,"I am probably going to be the only person that has purchased one of these Wild Wild West Series to say what a load of RUBBISH it is. Out of all the DVD series sets I have ever bought - and I have quite a few, this is the WORST. First, the tranfer of the colours is overdone, albeit decent quality. Second apart from a very few small scenes outdoors, the majority of the scenes are indoors on set - and it shows. Everything seems to have been done cheaply. An absolute waste of the actors talents, which is a pity, because there are some decent actors in the series. I will not be purchasing more."
1,You are stark raving mad if you buy this piece of garbage,"I like Seann William Scott and the other reviews on it indicated I would like it. This one goes on my worst movies ever list. It is so low budget, bad acting, worse editing and I cannot believe Lou Diamond Philips or Dave foley would take the roles they did. It has no redeeming qualities. Now I know R rated movies can have nudity and profanity but it is abused in this movie. Whenever they didn't have a word to fit they threw in the F word. The chemistry with the lady interest was non existent. The villians were unbelievable. On the whole totally let down by this. Gave it one star because you have to. I have seen it listed under $2 and that is too much. Save your money. If you want to see an enjoyable movie with Seann William Scott check out Rundown."
1,I am ashamed to own this video,"I bought this video in the bargain bin for $2. I now know that I have completed wasted the money and also lost 2 hours from my life by watching it. I'm not surprised that it hasn't be re-released but I'm amazed that it was released in the first place. The acting is poor, the story is incoherent, the action is sloppy and couldn't be more poorly done. I'm sure that any high school drama class with a video camera and a combined IQ of more than 80 could do better. Final advice: Clip your toenails instead of watching this movie, at least it would be more entertaining."
4,Lost user manual,I really like this toy. It's really fun. I lost the user manual but my mom just called Mattel and they sent it to us electronically. In the US: 800-524-TOYS (800-524-8697) In Canada: 800-665-6288. They also said they could mail it to us if we had problems getting from our email.
2,A Bit of Nothing,"Huether has many Pathophysiology books and they all are the same material with a different cover. I felt this book lacked substance, it was often boring and not very user friendly. If you are looking for a book to help you gain a better understanding of pathophysiology this one is not it, as well as the many other ones that are written by Huether."
3,No-Way-Street,"It seems, this New York 1994-year-story of the Luke Shapiro-a school graduate from a Jewish descent is a logical sequence toMendy, andHoly Rollersbecause of presenting the secular Jews' similar drugs-money-making-with-goyem problems.A boy graduates school, supporting himself by selling drugs and attending a psychologist for advice, being financially better than parents of him also a later evicted family residues further in a block-of-flats on 42nd.East as understood from a screened panoramic still of NYC.No drama is at the end but simply a no-way-street as both young and mature men are sucked into sex, drugs and lack of human warmness."
4,Coming of age in 94,"Much is made of the 1994 setting, but, aside from telephone booths, beepers, answering machines and mixtapes, I didn't really notice much difference from today. If one were 17 back in 94, maybe it seems like a lot has changed. This seemingly indie flick does have a great 94 soundtrack centered on the Notorious B.I.G. Ben Kingsley plays a wacked out shrink who collects weed as payment from a 17-yr-old high school drug dealer, Josh Peck, with girl problems. How did the kid get served beer in bars if he was a teen? Small detail. The kid takes growing up lessons from Kingsley while coping with his parents going broke, as he falls for the shrink's hot daughter, who uses him up and throws him away in a flash. Smart dialogue, and though it is comic, it has no belly laughs, just slow smiles."
2,this move tried wayyy too hard.,forrest gump ad on bus. notorious BIG just came out. kid plays game boy. it's 1994...i get it. why does the film have to keep showing it off? it tried way too hard. josh peck's overacting got annoying real quick. ben kingsly was the best part of the movie.
2,Stereotypic & Unrealistic,"Positive: Entertaining performance by Kingsley & Peck.Negatives: (1.) Another stereotypic and simplistic rendering of the '60s - shown as a period of largely drugs and irresponsibility. (2.) A hugely successful psychiatrist is more drugged than the entire inner city, has a loveless marriage and lives to do little else but relive his youth. Believable - No. (3.) Good looking, intelligent teen has dysfunctional parents, makes tens of thousands a summer selling weed and doesn't know about sex. Believable - No.Lesson (Un)Learned: That was ""The Wackness"" and again, as in the past 70 years, writers and studios continue to make a lot of money retelling stereotypic stories - over and over again."
2,2 x Telephoto Conversion Lens,"This is made for relatively cheap cameras that don't have a good zoom lens. If you put this on the front of a Nikor long lens you will be a bit disappointed.But that's natural. It is really cheap. Remember what you grandmother used to say, ""If the deal seems too good, then it probably is."""
5,Sweet and Romantic,"I loved this book. The characters reminded me of people that I know, and the writing was very vivid. The book was definitely not a history book, however, that is what made it that much more believable. History was written by the winners of wars, and the common people knew about as much about politics and the ""noble"" classes as we ""common"" folks do today. I would love to see this book translated to film. I read on the author's site that this story was about his survival through childhood abuse, and that definitely added a richer subtext to the story. Mr. Marsche has an incredibly brilliant way with words and paints his scenes with great effect - I could literally see Boam bathing Kebryn, when he arrived at the villa. I could literally see Germanicus shaving in the creek before the sun rose. And I was virtually in the room with Kebryn, when the Roman general gave him the bracelet. If you are in the mood for a sweet and touching story, this is a book I would totally recommend."
3,ok at best,"I could have done this on a printer at kinkos and the quality would have been better. However, my son loves this plane and the angle of the picture so we are keeping it. Just be careful, if you want crystal clear picture quality you will not find it here."
1,Never received!,"I never received this product, and upon informing the company, they were not responsive at all to my complaint. This is the first time I have NEVER received an internet purchase, or got any concern, or correction from the company! :("
3,Preview for a real asthanga workout,This video is an introduction to an asthanga workout.It touched on the basics and his students were varied in experience.His teaching methods were precise for anyone wanting to enjoy a descent workout to strenghen their total body. The video is worth buying to compliment your practice.
3,Too little explanation of moves,"I found this workout helpful, but only because I'd studied, and practiced a little bit, the very nicely-explained book on Ashtanga Yoga by Beryl Bender-Birch, called ""Power Yoga.""If not for that, I would have been totally confused, and possibly injured myself.This tape is fairly helpful if you already have some knowledge about Ashtanga Yoga, but for a good introduction to a challenging workout, try the ""Crunch""tapes ""The Joy of Yoga"" and ""Fat -Burning Yoga"" by the lovely and unpretentious Sarah Ivanhoe."
4,Great after a maintnenance,"I was disappointed when I first tried to sharpen a kitchen knife. The wheel turned very slowly and would stop with even light pressure.I took both wheels off and the shaft would still barely turn. Once the grinding wheel is off, you can remove the shaft by sliding it toward the leather wheel side of the machine. The sleeve barrings were totally dry.I put a little silicon grease on the shaft and the machine has preformed wonderfully.If you are wearing the wheel too fast and the wheel won't hold its edge or the bracket is too flimsy, you are pushing too hard. Sharpening a tool takes very little pressure. You have to hold it enough that is makes good contact, but it really doesn't take much pressure."
4,Nothing like sharp tools...,"Pros: Sharpens fast, sharpens well, lots of jigs, nice torque\speed adjustements, good water trayCons: The finish of some of the jigs, the leather wheel on mine isn't that true\flat, power button should be on the topConclusion: I would buy another one in a heartbeat, sharpened everything in my house in under 3 days."
3,Worth a shot,This product does what it says. Our TV stand is too low to the ground for the product to work properly! Try it out it is worth a shot!
2,Not as good as the 1st for sure,I loved the 1st movie....but this sequel really disappointed me. Yes it was UNRATED...which sadly just made the kills so over the top they were silly and not very effective...the belt sander kill was just ridiculous.....not to mention the stupid sex scene.SADLY DISAPPOINTED.....Certainly not worth the Bluray price....better to wait for a USED DVD copy for about $3.
2,Nice to see once,"I liked the first part better, although this here also is some old school horror. But you've seen it all before. Not a must-see."
3,Lost The Magic of the first.,"I loved the original and was thrilled to see the release of a sequel. However...I was kinda disappointed. When I saw Danielle Harris was taking over the role of Marybeth....I really thought this was possibly going to be better than the first. Unfortunately she was the only welcome addition to this movie.I did enjoy the cameo clip that included the original Bayou Beaver Girls, asthese two are so funny I could watch them fight all day. While I didn't hate the movie I did find the story totally predictable and less intense than the first.I can only hope that Hatchet 2 be disregarded as most part 2 sequels are, and will come back with a part 3 that will restore faith and keep the series going (as some have in the past). So...PLEASE bring back the intense raw nature Victor Crowley had in the first film. Include more UN-forced comedy we saw the original.Most importantly...Keep Danielle Harris!!! and add better characters & actors, ones that we actually will care for."
1,Don't bother....,"Love Tony Todd, love Danielle Harris, but even with these two horror powerhouses carrying the load, it still could not save this dreck of a film. Laughable on just about every level. The Crowley character is just goofy, the effects are cartoonishly bad, and the direction is just about as amateurish as it gets. Rent MADMAN twenty times before wasting a dime on this one."
2,I really Wanted to like it.,"First off,I love Adam Green and this most of his work is wonderful.This movie seemed like it was in production forever I was really looking forward to it. ""What Happened"" Although Danielle Harris was a good fit for Marybeth She Over acted.All the extra back story they threw in seemed like split second unnecessary plot filleralthough there was some comic relief I wanted horror not a generic national Lampoon movie ""and that's being very gracious""....Yes,I know it's cheese, but Limburger?The gore was of course abundant but not nearly as well done as the first movie.I was highly disappointed and didn't really want to finish watching it that's how boring I thought it was..and the big reveal about the relative.. Much ado about not much.I just thought it was going to be spectacular and it was nowhere near that."
1,WHY WAS THIS MOVIE EVEN MADE?,"OMG!This is one of the worst films ever made in the history of film,With that said this takes me back to the title of my review.I mean really who thought it was a good idea to make this movie,It's not even good corny horror.I paused this movie 5 times just to get food & dricks to keep me into it,I felt like i was being tortured rolling my eyes threw the entire movie like when is this going to be over.The only good thing about this movie was that DANIELLE HARRIS was in it i've loved her acting ever since i saw her in Halloween 4.My advice to anyone thinking of renting or buying this movie is !!DON'T!! please don't but if you must see it borrow it from a friend therefore you will not feel like you've wasted your money and an hour and twenty minutes of your life like i did. (I can't believe this movie was in theaters)"
4,Really good author!,"Stephanie Bond is a new author for me, and I'm glad I chose her work. I'm looking forward to reading more..........."
5,whole lot of trouble,"As with most of Stephanie Bond's novels, it was humorous, and kept me reading until I was all done with it. I enjoyed the suspence that went with it."
3,A Cute Book,"A WHOLE LOTTA TROUBLY by Stephanie Bond is, like all her books that I have read so far, a cute, fast read. As always Amazon has hit the mark."
4,Very pretty watery fragrance,"The light, watery fragrance of Soul has made a big splash with me! The top note of this fragrance is water-grown bamboo, as well as freesia and other water flowers. At first it seems a bit heavy, but quickly (within minutes) fades to a light, watery aroma. The middle note contains scents of Arizona Cactus Flower, as well as other sweet lily scents. The bottom note contains hints of spice and musk, so after a few hours of wearing this it is a sexy, sultry fragrance.At first spray, my boyfriend was a little taken aback. He said, ""You smell like a lady who is going out for the evening."" (I think the translation is that it was a little powerful.) However, after about 15 minutes he sniffed again and said, ""Ooooh! Much better."" Later on in the evening, he said it smelled fantastic. Both of us prefer the muskier, spicey bottom notes, but I do enjoy the top notes during the day. It's a good day or night perfume."
4,"What is here is great, but...",there are still too many TFF videos missing. Such as:Pale ShelterThe Way You AreMothers Talk (2 versions)ElementalColdRaoul and the Kings of SpainGod's MistakeSecrets (2 versions)Closest Thing to HeavenCan't we have a more complete collection?
5,The Last Lovecraft: The Cthuhu Relic,"Good movie. I loved it and my wife, no big fan of HP Lovecraft or horror movies, really enjoyed it as well. The acting was well done, the script tight and it certainly didn't take itself too seriously. I suspect the writer, director, cast and crew can never be counted upon to take anything seriously, but they do avoid being too silly.Plot: (no spoilers) Kyle, a worker bee in an office and his buddy get a visitor who drops off a weird old relic and informs Kyle that he's the last Lovecraft living. His job is to protect it and keep some fairly cheesy looking cult members from getting it, otherwise, Cthulhu sets up shop again and the world is doomed.You don't have no know anything about the Cthulhu mythos to enjoy the film. In fact, there's a very funny comic book rendition of the mythos that covers all the major points.Well worth buying and highly recommended."
4,"Beats the Heck out of ""Manual"" Labor!","All too often students and professionals get tekkie-toys that they just don't have time to learn throughly. This book manages to do just that for the TI-83+; quickly, without expending midnight oil or pulling out any hair.""For Dummies"" is a misleading title for this series. Call it ""For Smart People who Value their Time and expect results""."
5,Handy Hopper,"Love this thing! Very useful for scooting around my garden, planting seeds and pulling weeds. Or, anything that used to require bending over. Also looking forward to using it when I pick beans. I can stay seated, without having to get up and down every time I move to another spot. Worth every penny!"
4,No more sore back.,This was a gift for the person who does the gardening here. Days spent in flowerbeds were always followed by nights spent in painful spasm. This handy little rolling seat gets you to the right height to work in the garden without having to bend and stoop all day. It rolls easily enough and includes a beverage holder for your water bottle and space enough for several gardening tools. It's been sturdy enough so far and looks like it will last a while. Who knew one of the best gifts would be as simple as a nice place to sit down?
4,Garden Hopper,A great little handy tool for arthritis ridden gardeners. Too bad it doesn't have a cup holder just to the side.
4,Excellent for many garden activities,"This ""Garden Hopper"" is well built and moves quite well -- back and forth. It can't turn, but that's not a real problem. I have enjoyed using it and it definitely helps my back problems. The only issue is that is not useable in the middle of dense gardens due to it's size."
3,mobile garden stool,"I liked the price of this but does not open for easy reach of tools, gloves, etc,difficult to clean but so handy to sit and pull weeds for a stretch of time."
1,Weak,"Did not say weight limit, only used two days and its starting to buckel by the wheels, I weigh 180# this should not be to much for a garden cart. Not at all happy!"
5,back and knee saver!,"I purchased this little stool with high hopes, and was very pleasantly surprised at how great it is! No more stiff legged, hunched over time after getting up from weeding. It has dramatically reduced my post-gardening ibuprofen consumption! This stool is sturdy enough to sit and scoot across uneven terrain, and stashes gardening tools in its belly for only one trip from the garage. My only complaint is that I have to hunt for it every time I get up, as my kids are quick to abscond with it for back yard races down the hill.Great gardening tool!!!"
5,Solid Musicians....,"This CD rocks! will make a drudge commute a pleasure...will transform you. very innovative melodically, lyrically, and engineered ingeniously; took me back to my Woodstock 1969 expierence...it's me margaret would have been right at home there with Joplin, Cocker, Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane, Baez, etc...it's me margaret lets me know what we had there lives on. all this group needs is national exposure, i.e., a spot on Leno and then check the tour dates!! ROCK ON"
4,Great Special Effects and Good Story,Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen has great special effects and a decent story. You can identify with the characters and feel like cheering the good guys on. It is an enjoyable movie to watch.
2,Too Political,"Good visuals, but poor plot. The most amusing thing was that US president Obama was one of the bad guys -- too political for an entertainment movie."
1,Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen Blu-ray SteelBook [FutureShop Exclusive],"why my product ""Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen Blu-ray SteelBook"" [FutureShop Exclusive] inside no including Blu-ray 2 disc..? inside is empty????"
3,Review of Second Transformers Movie,"I was disappointed in this sequel. I really loved the first movie. All of the same characters are back and I really liked the characters, except the parents who are portrayed as being stupid and annoying. The mother is made to look even stupider in the sequel. The action is nonstop but there was something lacking in this second movie. I did not enjoy it as much as the first one. Having a bureaucrat turn things upside down is such a cliche, and the reward of throwing him out of an airplane is not as great as it should be, given his interference in this. Maybe that is what does not ring true for me. I would not recommend this movie."
2,too many bad humor and bad story,"The main story isn't that good, the Decepticons now have perfect infiltrators and a satellite, no way the Autobots could do anything but they still win in the end. The Egyptian like Decepticon has nice design but he doesn't scare anybody. And this weak humor : Sam's mother smoking weed, the dumb autobot brothers, the big Decepticon having bollocks ... really make it feel like a comedy rather than an action movie but it doesn't succeed at any. It's barely saved by insane SFX and great cinematography.The Blu-ray image is awesome, making the action sequences really impressive and Megan Fox and Isabel Lucas are out of this world. Sound is detailed and well balanced in the 5+1."
3,Not as good as you might think...,"The movie had great special effects; however, there were so many sexual innuendos that I found it offensive, especially since they really went after the younger market with this. Had they kept it clean, it would have been much higher in my mind."
2,Transformers 2,I didn't like all the nastiness in this movie. ie: when the robot was humping the girls leg! Not necessary. And it seemed that they were trying too hard to make it funny. Too much sarcasm.
1,Shameful and Painful,I cant even go into detail this movie was so painful to the transformers franchise to watch :( My inner child was crying. Horrible Just Horrible!!!!!Thank You Michael Bay for killing a favorite part of my childhood!!!! Please For all that is holy Do not make any other films till you figure out whats so wrong with the films you make right know.
1,Additive & Subtractive Math,"In order to comment you have to give a minimum of one star. Didn't the Amazon programmers ever get past basic additive and subtractive mathematics? For example, I would give this movie two stars for it's CG effects. However, I would remove one star for excessive redundant and visually too-fast-for-appreciation CG effects. I would remove one star for a rambling poorly constructed and not very creative plot. I would remove one star for rote stereotypic read-the-script acting. Then remove a star for a formula script. And, as most everyone else has stated, remove another star for writers & directors not knowing their target audience. Finally, remove two more stars for language appropriate only for 17 to 19 year olds and sexual innuendo appropriate for never-got-around-to-growing-up adults.I'm not very good at math, but I think it's about -5 rating."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"It is Bad. Very Very Bad.I'm a fan of the first movie and the genre in general. I like special effects, but this movie is more like a demo reel from ILM showing what they can accomplish with $200 million dollars. 30 minutes into the movie I turned it off and didn't bother watching the rest of it for another week - basically until I ran out of other stuff to do. While Michael Bay's visuals are always stunning and he shoots a patriotic scene like no other director, we've seen it all before and I'd rather watch a movie without plot holes you could drive Optimus Prime through.If you must watch it, rent it and save yourself the money and the regret."
3,KIND OF A MESS,"I loved the first and third Transformers movies. They had decent stories, well placed comedy and impressive action. When I saw those in theaters, I was compelled to see them again. You just know when you like something like you know when you're hungry or in love. This one however, I did not get that feeling. I liked the action scenes. That was it. I felt the story was jumbled. The jokes were ill conceived and, as far as I'm concerned, over the top and over the line. I cringed. Shame. What happened? I'mnot a Michael Bay basher like many either. A great storyteller he is not, but this was bad. I like The Rock, Bad Boys, The Island and Armageddon. They're fun, adrenalized movies. Bad Boys 2, Pearl Harbor? MEH! This was a bit of a disappointment too."
1,Too much,"I felt like I was beaten over the head with this movie. I can stand, and even enjoy, a non-stop action movie for around 1:45, but 2:30 of that with hardly any attempt at a story? No way, too much for me! The four adults in our group were all just worn out by the end, no enjoyment at all. One toddler (who can usually sit thru most movies no problem) was bored well before it ended. Three teen-aged boys all loved it, though even they admitted there was no real story and they just liked all the action and special effects. The two girls with us weren't too interested. For what it's worth, none of us parents really thought the sexual innuendo was really that much, especially after reading criticism of it. BTW, we all liked the first one. I probably liked it less than the rest, but even though I never was into the Transformers as a kid, and thought the dialogue was really hokey, I did like it quite a bit and did buy it. This second one...don't even think I'd ever own it or even watch it for free."
1,I wish I could have transformed into a gun to shoot myself.,"This was by far the worst movie I have seen this year. It was a complete sequel rip-off of the first movie which was only a 3 star flick to begin with. There was no plot, and the acting was about as well developed as a Polaroid in the hot sun. The original animated movie release from the 80's was far superior to this movie. The only saving grace was the special effects which were phenomenal. That said, I would never sit through this movie again, nor wish anybody else to have to do the same. The attention to continuity detail was also hilarious. How can white pants stay so sparkling bright with explosions and tumbling through the dirt? Maybe she had a Tide Stain Stick with her. They should show this movie to the prisoners at Gitmo instead of waterboarding them. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT watch this movie."
1,Cant not play disc,"The copy protection on this disk prevents it from playing in my SONY media center PC, SONY DVD Changer, and Toshiba 32"" LCD/DVD player. It would play in the truck seat back mounted DVD player, but unlike my 2 YO I couldn't sit though a movie from the back seat. Plus didn't want to kill the battery. Ironically I could copy it and strip off the junk, but after reading these reviews it doesn't look like it is worth the effort. I just return it and cut my losses."
4,Great visual effects and an OK story,"I love blu-ray and this movie used all of the capabilities of the format. Great surround sound, great visual effects. Amazon always has the best prices on DVDs and using Amazon Prime ensures I get them quickly."
2,transformer revenge of the fallen,"I was excited when I heard their was a part two and so were my kids. The sound effects were great on my surround sound, but the language was not ok at all. This movie was a kids movie, know they just turned it into a joke. The language was so bad I won't let my kid watch it again. Their shouldn't be any swear words or pot in a kids movie, and the way they had sam's mom act was just stupid. The writer should just be fired. Anyway some of the movie was alright, but most of it was stupid. They should have ended it at part one. If you wana see it rent it, but its not worth $20.00 dollars."
2,Transformers 2?,"To be honest, I thought the second film would be better than the first. I really liked the first film but this was just too much. To me it seemed like they were mostly concentrating on the ""human"" aspect of the movie instead of the actual transformers themselves. I would have loved to see optimus fight a little more or maybe for the last fight scene to be a little longer. I could have done without all that Sam and his girlfriend, college problems. Way too much skin was exposed and this is not something for little kids. Which makes no sense seeing that they are the ones asking for the transformer toys. I don't understand why they would make a movie that little kids couldn't watch. Like another reviewer had stated. This should have been rated R instead of pg 13. They should have done better than this. I hope the 13rd installment is better than this one."
1,Ugh!!,"This movie is laughably terrible, if you ever meet anyone who said they liked this movie then you can be sure they didn't like the Transformers in the 80's.Also, a flesh and blood woman that turns into a robot? Come on! The writers even call her a Terminatrix in the commentary."
5,"OFF THE CHAIN!!!! GREAT FUN, GREAT MOVIE","I liked everything about this movie and I am far from being a kid. I saw it at the movie theatre and will be buying the dvd as soon as I can. It has all the components a good movie should have; which some of you tend to forget. It is supposed to entertain you and that's exactly what this movie does. Thank you Michael Bay, can't wait to see the next one."
3,Good action flick,"Decent action movie. Not a great movie for dialogue, but if you are looking for action and effects, spend the 2 hours to watch this."
1,SOOO BAD IN EVERYWAY!,This movie is BAD. So bad in fact that I almost walked out when I went to see it last summer. The fact that they are making a 3rd one is just AWFUL and I hope people don't see it. Megan Fox was smart not to take part in the 3rd movie. So in all do not spend money on Transformers 2.
1,BURNT CORN,"An abomination, everything we thought the first one would be. The fact that hollywood professionals were paid to hoist this ""entertainment"" on us is downright nauseating. Some of the worst dialogue, editing I have ever experienced. I forgive alot and many of my favorite ""movies"" are PART 2 sequels, but this is the exact opposite of a guilty pleasure. The critics should have been harsher."
3,Explosive,It was nice to be entertained for a couple of hours. If you like seeing a beloved 80s cartoon come to life then this is for you.
1,"First movie was good, this movie is terrible.","I've been sitting here trying to come up with the words for this review, and honestly I don't even know where to begin. It's possibly the worst movie I have ever seen and just thinking about it makes me tired. All I can say with honesty is that you should avoid this movie entirely. To sum up the entire movie in a sentence: ""It's all flash and no substance."" It looks great, but that's where the good ends. The story is hackneyed, the plot and pacing is terrible, the characters are quite literally walking stereotypes with no depth at all. It's just awful. I wouldn't watch this movie again if it was given to me for free."
1,Very BAD movie (although more of a car commercial than a movie),"I borrowed the blu ray from a friend to see what all the fuss was about. As a disclosure I did enjoy the cartoon when I was younger, but I could not finish the first movie so I did not bother going to the movies to watch this or even rent it. But I wanted to give it a chance and see what it was actually about. I did not read any reviews or anything about the movie so as not to be prejudiced about it.I was immediately disappointed. There is absolutely no plot at all, just explosions. I wanted to turn it off within the first 5 minutes, but decided to watch the whole thing. It was bad. I honestly could not bear watching it. It was less interesting than a car commercial which is pretty much what it is about. Not entertaining at all in my opinion.I know that other people love this movie, but I really wanted to express my opinion. You may like it, if you liked the teletubbies or whatever that baby show was called."
1,Just like a very long car trip . . .,". . . I kept asking myself, ""Is it over yet?"" This is, without question, the worst movie I have ever seen (60+ years of them). It is an unmitigated assault upon the eyes, the ears, and the mind's willing suspension of disbelief. Hasbro should be investigated, for this is little more than an infomercial for infantile minds. Please, Steven (Spielberg), no more of this drivel. Waste your time and money on something else."
2,"Unless you're a pubescent teen boy, don't waste your money","I was surprised that I actually liked the first Transformers but this one, it isn't even entertainment in my book. It is a way for a pubescent teen male to get his jollies. Everything at once as the male star has; 2 hotties bidding for his attention (one good and the other evil), he is savior of the planet, the kids are all smarter than ANY adult, lots of action and absolutely LITTLE Plot. I am actually sorry I spent $6 to rent this movie."
4,I was entertained,"I thought this movie was entertaining, a lot of action and had comedic parts. I don't know why it didn't get such good reviews. I thought it was better than the 1st one, but not as good as the 3rd. It isn't suppose to win any awards other than to entertain the viewer. I wish though that when they start explaining the plot that it wasn't so fast. I had to rewind to fully understand what the ancient transformer was explaining."
1,Terrible Movie,"I'll keep this short and sweet. The visual effects and action are very good. The story was non-existent, acting could have been better, ending was anticlimactic, I'm pretty sure the screenwriters didn't proof read the script, and they movie lost me when Shia went to Transformers heaven. I can normally sit through senseless action movies with ease, but I was simply so irritated by the lack of heart that I couldn't enjoy this, really sad considering I really enjoyed the movie. One star for the cool action sequence in the woods."
3,Decent movie / fembot,"This is a decent movie to own. I watched it and yes their is comedy relief. But would be nice if they made it more like the old cartoon series where the decepticons are in different colors. I was able to guess a couple of them, but not most. That is a flaw in my opinion that they should have fixed. I mean the autobots are in color, why not the decepticons.As per the fembot, yes there is a fembot in this move, and she is hot. Gave Megan Fox a run for her money. Well she did run that is for sure. Also the new addition of Arycee, the female autobot was nice. Although it was way to dark in the movie for her scenes. They did change how she originally looked, but still I believe she looks good and hot. Arycee was always the autobot that was a little risky and had a sex appeal even if she is only a robot.Hopefully if they create another movie, Michael Bay won't make everything so dark."
3,IMAX version with Full Screen Imax Scenes,"Anyone who saw The Dark Knight and loved the Imax scenes, the way it opened up the aspect ratio, pick the Walmart version. Cheaper and you get a minute more footage...whats not to love? If you dont care about the Imax scenes, or hate the aspect ratio changes, get this version."
3,"OK movie, but very bad edit job","The edit job is so bad, I bought two new dvds and end up returning both at different times. Third one I bought at a discount (used-like new), and edit job on this one stinks also. ALL THREE HAVE DIGTAL STOPS BETWEEN SCENES CLEAR THOUGH THE MOVIE. The person who did final edit before production to DVD's must have been on drugs. Very far from a professional job. FIRST ONE IS DEFFENTLY THE BEST OF THE TWO MOVIES"
3,Kids,"I'm not going to be snobby and say that there weren't parts of the movie I enjoyed. I like explosions and robot fights just as much as the next guy. Throwing in Megan Fox certainly helps to keep my interest. The problem is that the movie is all eye candy. It was okay to sit through once to see the great visuals, but there is not meat to the story. Everything was a set up to get to the next battle, the next explosion. I enjoyed some of the new robots, but the two ghetto bots grew increasing (jar jar binks) annoying as the movie went on. My son loved the movie, and I am sure most other 10 year old boys will too. As for adults, I think you can skip this one."
4,WoW,Not world of warcraft! Wow this movie was amazing. Good all the way through very entertaining. Only flaws were a lot of sex driven comments and actions that wernt necessary. Only there for a cheap laugh during real serious times. I would not recommend kids to see this movie it really is for the teen and above age group unless you put it on mute or something. 4.5 stars if they would let me give a half.
5,"Great fit, good sound, very sturdy!!!","I bought these headphones about 3 years ago and until, sadly my roomie's cat ate them. Up to that point they sounded the same as they did the day I bought them. These are the most sturdy headphones I have ever owned (and I've gone through quite a few headphones!) Not only are they great quality, they fit very well!! They also sound great too!! They were DEFINATELY worth the money."
1,Not Happy in NJ,"The shipper committed to delivery between 8:00-12:00, they failed to meet their commitment.The color is much more red then shows on line, was thinking a rich brown but has a definite red hue.The draws are completed cheaply; very light weight and glued together and I was under the impression they were dovetailed. All eight draws had debris inside them which I cleaned out because I didn't want any Chinese bugs hatching! I hope they are not imbedded..."""
1,Was great until it broke,"This little device was awesome, at first. Simple installation, it scanned all our channels, and we were able to watch TV off our iMac from bed! We used it a lot in the first couple of weeks we had it.Then the tip broke off. There was no reason for it, we didn't bump it, move the computer around, kick the cable, anything. We simply went to unplug it and the tip (that connects to the RF cable) broke off rendering it useless.If this were better made, it would easily have 5 stars."
5,THE ONE I WAS WAITING FOR,"Finally, a book that's not only about specific projects with the same old techniques. Judy Belcher has written a book that's on my top 5 among my 20 some books. It is very difficult to put it on the bookshelf.The galleries are very inspiring. I own other books but this one helped me reach the next level with my creations.Thank you Judy for giving us the inspiration and techniques.Norma."
4,polymer clay crative traditions,"Very informative book, beautiful photography and very clear instructions. Very nice book"
3,It Got Better,"The first time I did this tape I was frustrated and annoyed. I find Baron Baptiste's shirtless bravado and touchy-feely stance with the students on his tape a bit creepy. However, I always give tapes a second chance after a bit of time has passed in order to see if my opinion has changed. Well, my opinion of Baron Baptiste being a little creepy hasn't changed, but my impression of the actual yoga has. This tape will certainly give you a good workout, and I found the ab portion to be very effective. So, in summation: ignore Baron and focus on the yoga and it's worthwhile."
4,Great,Nice product keeps wires out of way. only thing i do not like is that bot ends need to be pulled equally.
3,Not As Great As It Looks,"Flimsy, retracting cords do not work that well and get tangled easily if both ends are not pulled equally. Doesn't charge the Ipod but the sound is good."
1,Confusing,"Trista Russel wrote a very good book called, Fly on the Wall, and I was expecting this one to be just as well written, but it was confusing. She went off topic a number of times and the pages are filled with unnecessary information. It was just too boring to finish."
5,"Trista, Has Done It Again!!!!!!!!!!!!","OH MY GOD!!!!! Trista, has done it again with this one everybody, I literally read this book in four hours, because I could not put it down. In this story, Trista gives us a glimpse of her other side, she tells a powerful story of love, faith, and the POWER of GOD!!! It makes you believe that no matter how much you think you don't deserve something, GOD always has a plan tht even we can't imagine for ourselves! This story quickly became my favorite among Trista's books, and once you read it, you will DEFINITELY see why!!!!!!!!! Trista, is surely a talent to be reckoned with, and I can't wait to see what she gives us next!!!!! Way to go Trista, you are three for three!!!"
4,Great book,"Even though it took kind of long for them to reunite the book was great. I love the set up and the drama, it was a different kind of book that really kept my attention. GREAT WORK!!!!!!!!!"
5,Great Book!,"I loved Chocolate Covered Forbidded Fruit. Every book that I have read by Trista Russell is a great book. This book holds alot of depth to it. I read this book in 1 day, and I couldn't put in down. It was that good. I liked the ending, it reminded me of the movie The Butterfly Effect, where different scenerios played out, of what could of happened. This book is so much better than other crap which is referred to as Urban Lit. This book will be one of your favorites if you read it, you will not be dissapointed. I would have rated it with 10 stars if I could!"
2,Overpriced,"After purchasing the product, I found the same product being offered by Amazon in a 4-pack for just $2.48 more than I paid for just one bottle. This is a GREAT product, but I feel like this vendor ripped me off!"
1,An Error-Filled Encylcopedia,"If you are looking for accurate facts, DONT buy this book. Many errors in the skater bios. For instance, it states that Mishketuniek & Dmitriev won the 1994 Worlds when in fact they did not even compete. Many remembrances of skating events are completely off the mark as well. Hold out for someone else to get it right. This man did not."
1,I Must Have Received A Different Film,"I do not know what the positive reviewers of this film are talking about. Got this film in March of '12 and I was completely bored and unimpressed with anything about it, production or story. Watch this for free if you have to see it, but don't buy it 'cause it's not worth the shipping."
5,Two step marimba mallets used for vibraphone,"I bought a pair of these over ten years ago for a log drum. I had been using them here and there for two mallet vibraphone. Just this past month I decided to buy a second pair and have been using them four mallet ever since. I actually really like the two step. Lots of reflex. These are pretty soft mallets, so there is little attack. I'm enjoying the sound."
5,"Spiritually uplifting,very powerful,made me cry","I cannot say too much about this book,words are not enough.The best story I have ever read. Changed my life forever"
3,Cool Downz review,"Eh, not so good. Not so bad. Much shorter than I thought. You must soak it for at least 30 minutes for it to work"
2,Cools you but in a wet way,"In the incredible humid heat this summer, I was looking for something that would keep me cool while walking. This scarf does indeed feel cool, but I didn't remember that it would be wet. With the incredible humidity outside, adding more wetness around my neck simply added to the discomfort."
5,Not for the casual fan,"This is a collection of remixes and edits from all of APB's singles. So, if you're looking for a ""greatest hits"" type of deal, this is not it. This is, however, an essential collection for anyone that wants to hear some of APB's older singles and EP's. The reason why the Mourn EP is not featured on this album is because it is still released on Tantra records, and is not to be deleted in the near future. I do recommend buying the Mourn EP however, as it contains some of APB's best work."
3,"Missing an important EP sans, this is incomplete!","Where is the Mourn ep? This is a nice little comprehensive set, though Apopcalyptic Manifesto covered most of disc two. Mourn was an extremely important single and the ep is significant! Cannot believe Stephan (or Tantra! the bums) left it out! The ""extended version"" of Nothing Else Matters is horrid with the two minute intro. Best part of this collection is having the singles comprised together. The mastering isn't all that great either. It's a nice start for Apop newbies. Beatbox is one of their finest achievements, glad that is here."
5,Absolutely A Must,"Run don't walk out to get this video. You will not be disappointed. This is strenuous and intense, but you will LOVE it. It is doable, even if you have never worked out with weights before. You would start by just doing one or two of each exercise. This is a tape you will keep always. I tell you, if you are over 50, you will get inspiration by just looking at this woman. She is in fantastic shape. I can't recommend this tape enough."
4,"Interesting, not for those who are extremely agressive","Personally, when I started reading the book, it was not bad. I liked the mathematics section on how to solve subtle problems through picture drawing. Very intersting. The problem is, the Brain Builder exercises are rather weird and some of them are just plain awkward. I expected the ""Logic"" section to be much more sophsisticated since I'm really into intelligence building through logic. For those who are starters in the field of ""ADMIRATION OF INTELLIGENCE"", this book is alright. I'm experimenting with other books also. If I find a more agressive one, I will note."
3,We all need this,Very interesting reading. We all need to protect our brains. We only get one shot at it and when it begins to fail it is debilitaing. Also check out coconut oil and nutritional things you can do to support your brain
5,HERE COMES THE MUNSTERS,This is a great piece of movie history to add to any collection. (But you can get it cheaper at Best Buy. Sorry Amazon)
3,Where is The Addams Family?,"While i do like the musters and it was a GREAT show, i wanna know when there gonna do the same for The Addams Family!"
1,Great comedian - poor book,I truly enjoy the stand up routine of Larry The Cable Guy but he was unable to capture that same energy in this book. I found the book a huge disappointment and would suggest that your money would be better spent on a DVD of one of his performances.
3,Funny but offensive,"It is funny. Just too bad that Larry had to stooop to racist, hate talk--always directed against Mexicans--to appeal to the lowest common denominator reading this book. Oh, he is the perfect redneck and he will go out of his way to prove it, subscribing to every redneck goober sterotype out there--he supports the NRA, John Wayne, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, (he was playing President when Larry wrote the book) NASCAR, lives in a mobile home, uses Skoal, and on and on. He is the perfect redneck, or so he portrays himself to cater to his base. He fills the book with jokes about flatulence and feces, it is, above all, oriented to the level of a jr. high school locker room. Too bad, I think he has a lot of talent for what he does. Just too bad the has to stoop to what he thinks is the level of his average fan. And that is an insult to anyone in the South."
2,not worth it,The author might know Exchange but its clear from reading his initial chapters on network and windows setup that he doesnt know DNS or Networking very well. Many of his examples are very amatuerish and in some cases incorrect.
1,Poor writing style,"Maybe the content of this book is ok, but the writer has constant urge to put useless text lines and useless personal opinions between the technical explenations. This shouldn't be a story book ...Things get worse when on page 142 he still needs to explain the difference between FAT and NTFS.quote: ""Setup displays a little gauge showing formatting progress. Formatting takes quite abit of time.""in this case, burning a book is ok ;)"
4,Stereo was not needed,"The picture is great. That was all I needed. I send the sound from my cable box to my stereo, I havent used the speakers on a tv in about seven years. So not getting the stereo version was not a real issue for me. Everything else up to this point has been great......."
1,BONNIE TYLER STILL THE BEST,"SORRY KIM GREAT VOICE BUT TO COUNTRY, IF U LIKE ROCK BLUES AND BALLADS GO FOR BONNIE TYLER. NEEDLESS TO SAY SHE IS STILL ROCKING AND REALEASING NEW MATERIAL. GO BONNIE I SAY"
5,Fantastic! HIGHLY Recommend.,"Not knowing a lot about the war and human rights abuses in Sri Lanka prior to watching the film, I was educated and engaged throughout the documentary.The film stays bipartisan, not choosing sides, but rather just presenting the information and seeking to fill the gaps. While the ending might not be what viewers expect, it's realistic and causes viewers to ponder, question, and investigate more on their own.I highly recommend this film to anyone."
1,Very disappointing book,"The artwork in this book is appalling, never mind the text. Buy a Dorling-Kindersley book instead!"
1,worthless,"This is a dictionary. Words are spoken from A to Z with the translations following each one. It is pointless and will not help you learn German. A related word list book, such as ""Teach Yourself German Vocabulary"" or ""Mastering German Vocabulary: A Thematic Approach"" would be much more useful."
5,Seattle's masters of comical collage strike again,"If you are a fan of groups like Negativland, you'll definitely like the Bran Flakes. They are consistently hillarious and masters of sound collage. A fine addition to any collection."
2,good performance but this sounding,"The poor fidelity takes this good performance down once the digital glare and thinness starts to get to you. I can't listen to CD's for long at all these days, but this is not much better. why are there so many DVD-A's with horrible sound? Very counterintuitive to me."
3,corelle set,They are great as an everyday place setting. I wish the dessert plate was bigger. The mugs could be improved.
4,"Nice set, excellent quality, the set should be differently composed though","I love Corelle, it is so practical for daily use, light and easy to clean. This set however should have an option to come with the luncheon plate instead of the salad plate which is much more of a saucer than a plate. Also I don't need the mugs, but the acrylic glasses are not a better option because their design is not good, they accumulate water and do not get dry in the dishwasher. Corelle, please, compose a set with a luncheon plate, and improve the design of the acrylic cups!"
3,not very appealing,"good for occassional,boring for everyday use.too simple floral-pastel.should've been made little more interesting. good when senior citizons are around."
4,DZMV200A,I was very happy with this camcorder. I understand that I had to buy the optional kit for computer connections. I was told that this is a Home Electronics and not a computer product. After I realized that I understood why all the computer stuff is seperate.
1,Disappointed in quality,Very dissapointed in quality/workmanship. The color was already worn off where the magnets contacted when I received the board. The board and chips felt cheesy and cheap. I returned this product.
2,Not The Best Example of Clark's Immense Talent,"I love Mike Clark's drumming. This CD does NOT represent his finest work. I was shocked when I listened to this CD the first time (I doubt there will be a second listening) as to how uneven and, at times, amateurish Clark and his sidemen sound. For a more flattering example of Mike Clark's drumming as band leader I recommend: ""The Funk Stops Here"", ""Give the Drummer Some"", ""Summertime"" and ""Actual Proof"" or Herbie Hancock's ""Thrust, as well as ""Straight From the Gate"", ""Survival of the Fittest"" and ""Return of the Headhunters"" by the Headhunters."
2,Stick to the Bo Deans,"I found this cd to be quite bland with only one song ""Like I Do"" standing out. As has been the case with the last few Bo Deans albums it doesn't have anything distinctive enough to recommend. It is a bit of a departure from the Bo Deans but not much. Sadly I think they have run their course creatively. Stick with Love & Hope or Outside Looking In and remember their glory days."
1,Not compatible with Window of any kind. Run in DOS mode!,"I picked up this game yesterday at my local thrift store for .50. It was in excellent condition. I was excited, because I am a fan of Chris Sawyer. I love his RCT games. But this game is sooooooo old, it was made in 1997 and it says in the insert that it must run in DOS mode. I can't get it to run on my machine. I don't know how to do DOS> Just a head's up for those of you who don't know either. I'm sure this game is awesome, and I know I won't be disappointed, IF I can get it to run! Be cautious. This game is OLD. It actually says in the insert that it was made BEFORE Windows was made."
2,Please Put Bags Over Their Heads Too,"I agree with the last reviewer, but I would like to add that all actors--other than Catlaina--should not only leave their clothes on, but should also put bags over their heads."
3,Easy reading but a bit repetitive,"I got this book after a recommendation by a friend. it was very easy reading, but a bit repetitive. some very deep thoughts to ponder around. but half way through i almost wanted to put it down. i did finish it eventually, but not one of my ""must read books""."
1,Osho the charlatan?,"Be aware this Osho is the same ""guru"" who under the names Rajneesh Chandra Mohan and ""Bhagwan"" (the blessed one) in the 70's and 80's built an empire out of ""spirituality"", taking followers for $6 million to build an ashram in Oregon and at one time owning 29 Rolls Royces for his personal use. He was subsequently deported and changed his name again, presumably to continue the charade. But you be the judge of his work, this ""review"" is given only in the interests of full disclosure, which you will not find on the book jackets! Peace and blessings."
4,Great instruction,"I""m experienced with Pilates, but this is my first Mari video and I'm impressed with her cues, reminders on proper form and her relaxed, but fun attitude. My only problem with this video (and most other exercise videos) are the silly comments like, ""you'll have a great rear view!"" or ""the body of your dreams!"" I always cringe during workout videos and with they'd come up with something that sounds more natural or better yet, how about subtitles so I don't have to listen to the silliness.Anyway, love Mari and am looking for more."
5,Trade Martin - Tribute to BB King,A great CD. Well produced.My favorite song on the CD:13. Love Is The Bottom Line.Just GREAT.
2,Sound quality not so good,Sound quality was poor and it doesn't produce the powerful sound this choir is known for.
2,Valley 75090 Receiver Tube,"Needs to be taller. With the bike rack in place, there is not enough clearance to raise the Stowmaster 5000 tow bar high enough to clear the ball. Everytime I connect or disconnect the car, the bikes have to come off then the bike rack has to come off. I'll have a weld shop modify it for probably more than the hitch cost me but Valley should make the receiver a couple inches taller. Maybe an inch would do it -- their testing should determine."
4,Cluytens in Italy,"This was an impulse buy that I tossed in my Amazon shopping cart a few months back. This budget-line title from the Aura label features one of my favorite conductors, Andre Cluytens, in live recordings from 1965 of the Franck Symphony and Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 4 with the Orchestra della Svizzera Italiana. Friedrich Gulda joins on piano for the Concerto, and while the liner notes go to great lengths to deify his performance (they actually call him ""an angel""), the rendition is masterful but certainly not god-like. The sound is very good, but doesn't come close to matching the same quality as a first-rate studio account. A fun disc for sure, but certainly not definitive by any means."
3,April win box set,3 stars. Not so well..Most of the songs I do not listen to 4 cd set . Should have been a 2 cd set as the others two CDs are useless ..there is a live cd..ok it duplicates one of he CDs but as a live version..to me not such a big deal..And the other cd ..All bad songs that should have been rated as April wine Misses..meaning songs that nobody wants to hear..So you get 2 ..= two good CDs out of this set..No art work .Just. A Box with 4 CDs in it.Save your money
4,Blackberry,I was really pleased with the price of this holster. It is exactly like the one that was over $30 in the phone store.
5,just what i needed,"As a female road warrior, I need quick access to my Blackberry. Also, I do not always want it clipped to my slacks as a lot of men do. The swivel click makes my life much easier. The magnetic clip is a great feature for me. I have never had my BB fall out due to not being closed, etc. It is relatively soft and is not the brick hard holders that are often provided. And it fits like a glove for the Curve."
1,Disappointed,Brought as a replacement. Clip broke within one month. Returned to Amazon as defective and was charged for return shipping.
1,Not made for 8300 series phones. Auto off/on does not work,"Holster that you will receive is for 88XX series devices and not 83XX series. You risk pocket dialing and deleting all data, contacts, notes, etc., without the auto on/off feature. Five star friendly customer service but at the end of the day, this is not the proper holster as advertised."
3,Actual product doesn't match description,"It's not a huge deal but the actual product that ships is not the holster for an 8300, 8310, 8320, 8330 instead the actual product is a Blackberry 88XX Swivel Holster. The 88XX holster will fit 83XX models but it's a bit larger than necessary. I specifically bought this one because I wanted the smaller form factor for 8300 models. At this point it's not worth it to return them.Otherwise the holster is genuine Blackberry equipment and functions just like a Blackberry holster should."
5,No problems,"I bought this one and the one for $7.99 (for a coworker) to see if one was better than the other. They are exactly the same and the same as my other coworkers' who bought theirs for $20+ at Best Buy or the mall kiosk. I read the reviews that complained about the clip breaking, but we've had ours for a month and no problem yet. I like how it swivel-clicks, so I often keep mine horizontal, which I think helps getting in and out of the car. The magnet works perfectly, so the Blackberry keypad shuts off each time I put it in the holster. I have absolutely no complaints so far."
3,Broken Blackberry chrome logo,I really enjoy this product. My only complain is that the chrome BlackBerry logo piece came off after a few months. I unfortunately do not know where it came off and cannot reattach it. Unlike other users I have had no problems with the belt clip even though I put it through some rough use (daily bike rides to and from work). It shows no sign of breaking even after having been dropped several times. Were the chrome piece still attached I'd have to give it 5 stars. Six months and counting.
4,Works great just as descibed and at a cheap price.,I read a lot of reviews about the clip breaking off and I have had the case for about a month now. It works great and seems to be fairly sturdy without any problems.
1,Not worth it,The clip broke off of the leather holster. Apparently the little swivel mechanism attaches the clip to the holder by a very weak plastic rivet. Waste of money.
2,Not right for the 8820,"Although it was listed as a replacement case for the 8320, the strap is about 1/4"" too short and doesn't always hold the phone in securely. Other than this, it's a complete knockoff of the case that came with the phone."
1,RIM (OEM) BlackBerry 8330 Swivel Holster - Pitch Black,My first Hollster came with the phone. The clip broke after two weeks it got caught on my car seat. I purchase a new hollster and the clip broke after Three weeks. Poor design and would not recommend don't waste your money
5,Good Product.,It's just what I needed to take care of my new blackberry. Good value for the price and quick and timely delivery.Thanks.
3,Broken clip but my own fault,"My company provided the BB and accessories so I am not sure I received the exact product described in these reviews, however besides the middle seam, my leather case looked and behaved exactly as described in these posts.I got my BB 8830 in December 2008 and the holster performed perfectly until October 2009 when I accidently sheared off the belt clip by knocking it against the kitchen counter. I am ordering this product in the hope it will be equal or better quality that the one it is replacing.Wearing your phone on your belt introduces inherent risks, like the one above. It is at exactly the same level as many daily obsticles (seatbelts, countertops, co-commuter's handbags, etc.).I would recommend they replace the plastic pivot with a metal one. It looks like a lot of people have sheared the clip the same way I did."
2,Pretty bad,Grade D movies at best. These things are not worthy of being on Amazon or anyone with an IQ over 70. Please do not watch these. It probably kills braincells.
4,Crossbow bolt lumenok,"The picture shown is totally wrong. I agree with Randolph, don't buy this unless you want to use it on a crossbow using flat ended bolts. That's what I needed, and the knock fits bolt size 2219's, but it is so tight that it could not be turned off, so I slightly rubbed it with sand paper and it works beautifully."
4,Just Shy of Greatness,"Abbado and the BPO recorded a whole Beethoven symphonic cycle in Berlin in April 2000, for release on DVD Audio. In February of the next year the same ensemble and conductor filmed a live cycle in Rome, for release on DVD Video (except that the European Concert performance of the NINTH on 1 May 2000 in Berlin took the place of the Rome performance of the NINTH in the video cycle).Abbado's DVDV release is the best Beethoven cycle on home video, with really superlative sound and fine camera work. Yes, it beats out Gielen (1999), Karajan (1970s) and Karajan (1980s).The DVDA has even better sound than the DVDV, of course, but Barenboim's DVDA cycle with the Berliner Staatskapelle is even better. Teldec's engineers did a little better job for Barenboim than DG's engineers did for Abbado. Look around for the rapidly disappearing DVDAs of Barenboim, and if you can't find them, snap up the Abbado."
1,I feel cheated!,Respecting Oracle Press I bought this book... :( NEVER AGAIN! Why don't they clearly write on the outside that this is a word-for-word copy of the DBA 8i Certification Guide? Makes you realize the pitfalls of online buying!!!
2,Frustrating..,"I found quite a few errors in this book, which was incredibly frustrating - especially considering I was learning new material. The answers for the practice tests have references to some index that's not in the book."
4,Toddlers and twos,"I found this book very useful for my work with toddlers, twos, threes and fours. Why? Because all activities can be adapted to older children. Creative and low-cost activities are always welcome in a Learning Center!"
4,excellent source of help,This book has helped my husband and I tremedously in our novice attempt to sell things on e-bay. It was well worth the money to have this book as a reference book when we had questions. We have made a lot of money so far!!
5,Online Retail Is In The Model T Phase,"Marsha wields a mighty pen with this treasure of information about eBay. The lessons learned within this prominent guide will help the small or large Internet entrepreneur navigate through the myriad of possibilities.There is no fluff, only extremely well-researched data, case studies and thoughtful advice on how to make money on eBay."
5,Very useful,I really enjoyed this book. It's informative and fun at the same time. There are many tips that I found helpful as a seller. It may be a bit too simple for someone who's been around Ebay for a year or so but for a beginner it's a terrific start.
5,Don't Do Tokyo Without It,"Ultimate guide to the streets and trains / subways of Tokyo, hands down. Nice slender profile and easy to use format. I personally use it to plan the day that is forthcoming. Now I can hop on the right train, transfer with ease at the right place, know which exit to leave the station, and walk to my destination. When a book can help tame the confusion of one of the world's largest cities and provide a sense of confidence in knowing the accuracy of it's information will easily get you to where you want to go, that is saying something."
3,handy but,i'll keep it brief. it comes up short when it comes to the details. published in 2004 its not up to date. i bought this to use while in tokyo but I found the map is missing a bridge i was looking for. lesson learned: buy the most recent map book in Tokyo/Japan when you get here.
5,Una excelente guía,"But beware. This is not just a useful guide for the Southwest. Most of the birds of the Chihuahuan Desert (the largest desert in North America, covering from parts of TX, NM and AZ to Central Mexico) are depicted in this guide.I would go as far as to say that this guía is the best Spahish guide for North Central Mexico. I live in Torreon (SW Coahuila) and this is much better for this part of the country than Peterson's Aves de México."
1,Price is out of Line,"The flavor of the Hazelnut Coffee is very good. I really enjoy this flavor. The price for a box of 18 pods ($15.00) is very pricy. The coffee was good, but not $15.00 good. Can be purchased elsewhere for 1/3 the cost."
5,QAF first season,It is the best thing on tv once you start watching this show you will be an addict for it like a junkie looking for your next fix. It is such a wonderful story line about friendship an d love and what family really means. Don't just think about buying this DVD buy it period.
2,Watered-down and sanitised version of Brit TV series,"I enjoyed this, yes, but thought it unquantifiably inferior to the British (and first) version. For one - the actors. While the British ones were accessible, real, human beings, the casting for the American version is dissapointing: predictably, the guys are exquisitely groomed clones, each one boasting a set of bleached-to-perfection teeth. None of them is quirky or different, but just plastically good looking, and cast from the generic, catalogue model mould. The British series was great. This one is OK, but pretty much like watching a non-stop CK commercial. Where's the heart, the warmth, the realism?"
3,Get the UK version instead...,"I am sorry but I have to agree... the UK version has little to do with this one. I never understood why the really fast and extremelly videoclip-like original HAD to be stretched this way so that more episodes could be produced... boring most of the time and really lost most of its initial impact along the way. The actors are no longer ""normal-looking"" men who just happen to be gay but are portrayed as most str8 people see gays...and then again you HAD to have more female actors, less drugs, more of the gay & lesbian activism stuff and surely much less of the ""age issue"" to get away in the States! And the music... where has all the trashy dance stuff gone??? If you really want to see the first really revolutionary TV series get hold of the original!"
5,"A great gay soap opera, not to be missed!","This groundbreaking series about a group of gay men living in Pittsburgh is great fun to watch. Don't confuse it with reality, since all the characters spend most of their time at the gym, at the local bar or having sex. Too bad reality can't be like this! Still it's enormously entertaining and extremely addictive. I don't know how it goes over with heterosexuals, but all of my gay friends and I love it."
4,Queer As Folk DVD set (season 1),"Took a bit to get here, but found out the reasoning so it was understandable. Once I contacted the seller they responded very fast and got it out to me. The items were as they should've been, like new, no scratches at all on the discs (YAY!). Overall went pretty well :)"
2,"Excellent series, flawed production","As an ardent fan of the series -- which originally was available to me only through video rentals -- I was excited at the prospect of owning my own copy. Unfortunately, surprisingly bad production values seem to plague the DVD release: 5 of the 6 discs on my copy had repeated tracking problems, resulting in frequent freeze-framing and occasional skipping. Although I'm willing to put up with this on a video rental, I think that the retail price is too high for such sloppy craftsmanship. And buyers beware: similar tracking problems also occurred with my copies of Seasons Two and Three. Until Showtime steps in and improves the quality of its DVDs, I would recommend acquiring it in VHS format -- or stopping by your nearest video rental!"
5,Best show ever!!,"The characters are engaging,interesting and fun. Acting, especially by Gale Harold is exceptional. I'd suggest seeing it, gay or straight."
5,Fantastic,Loved it loved it loved it!Being a chick of course the hard bodies are a bonus but apart from that the stories are excellent.Looking forward to seeing the UK version (apparently better than this version according to the majority) but will they have cast anyone hotter than Gayle Howard??? I doubt it!
5,So Far So Good!,I have always known about qaf but I never actually seen the series but I just recieved seasons 1&2 and I have to see that so far what I have seen I am totally hooked!! I plan to purchase seasons 3&4 next month!! Whatever your sexual oriantation you have to see this series! You will fall in love!
2,Good photo scanner-bad with negatives,"Bought it 2 years ago. Good with photos & slides, terrible with negatives. Tendency to freeze computer up for no apparent reason.Very frustrating. Incompatible with new PC that has Windows 2000, in spite of claims to the contrary:downloaded drivers from Umax's page but still can't get it to work.Online support didn't help either: suggested I buy their CD for $40 to fix the problem. Shopping for new scanner now, obviously not from Umax."
1,Umax [is bad]for customer service,"Buy Umax only if you will never upgrade your software. If you plan on upgrading your operating system in the future Umax is not the way to go. Any time you need to upgrade drivers for say a new operating system or if you lost yours, unlike most other computer manufacturers, Umax will not let you download drivers for the upgrade. Instead they will mail you the drivers for just [money amount]. Real customer service."
5,great scanner,"I bought this one new last year and it works just great with Word and Adobe. Then I changed operating systems to Windows ME and ME does not support it. Neither does XP. However, XP does not support Norton either so it is not the fault of UMAX that the scanner does not work."
5,Useful skills for professional & personal life,"Book was clear, concise and easy to read and understand. It covers very basic skills and would be good for any staff but especially employees just entering the work force. It's a good review for everyone else."
1,waiting,"Not so much a review but as a customer wanting to know why my order is taking so long? My order was placed 3 months ago,still no CD and no explanation of wht the delay. I could have ordered this product from someone else and could habe been enjoying this music for several weeks now. Please explain????? If I have to cancel this order I will also stop shopping at Amazon. And I purchase alot every month. Make me feel like a valued customer and not the way I feel now. Frustrated over the long wait and not very pleased with the delay. Roger Hornung"
4,Good stuff,"Inventing Being is a collection of poems written by Ferenc Mózsi, translated into English by Peter Hargitai. These poems deal with all the hardships man goes through with love. One thing that I found interesting was that the translator left the original poems on every page, with the translation next to it. So if anyone knows anything about the language, you can actually see what the author actually means in all of his poems. Mózsi would also play with words making each poem more interesting. I gave it four stars though since some poems need to be read numerous times to fully understand it."
3,"Fair storyline, good basic facts, excellent airplane photos","Ephrim Zimbalist Jr and Karl Malden portray a wing commander Colonel and Master Sergeant crew chief respectively with the Colonel chasing the crew chiefs daughter as a love interest. This would never be tolerated, (fraternization), in the real Air Force, but it makes for conflict in the story line. Excellent footage of B-52's on the ground and in the air. Reasonably accurate portrayal of the stress and strain of life in the late 50's Air Force. I was a ""SAC weeney"" from 1963 until 1979 and it brought back a lot of memories."
4,Surprised me!,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I finally got around to watching this movie, I really liked it. It has great shots ofB-47's and B-52's in action, the story line was good (although not probable, a squadron CO would be canned immediately for what the movie character was doing), and I thought it portrayed the life of a military aviation mechanic fairly accurately (I was one in the Navy). If you enjoyed Jimmy Stewart's ""Strategic Air Command"" you'll enjoy this movie.I gave it four stars because the story line is stretching it a bit but overall I enjoyed this display of Cold War Era SAC equipment."
5,Bombers B-52,DVD arrived in excellent condition and ahead of time. Great service. Would highly recommend the seller.
3,I Was Forced To Watch This!!!,"My dad received this as an early Birthday present, and he forced me to watch this because I had forced him to watch Punisher War Zone! I didn't think it was awful, it's just not my type of movie. Master Sergeant Chuck Brennan doesn't like Colonel Jim Herlihy, and to make matters worse, Chuck's smokin' hot daughter, Lois is dating Jim. There are a few funny moments. I love the look of the classic 50's! You might like BOMBERS B-52!!!"
2,$300??,"I only bought this machine to make sourdough bread from scratch. If you are fine with store bought mix than save some money and buy a different machine. It doesn't have 300 cycles, it comes with a manual that has 300 recipes. It bakes bread just fine, but so does the 8 year old toastmaster that I bought for $50. And the toastmaster makes butter..."
3,Did not hold up for everyday use,"I got this machine for Christmas 05'. I spent hours researching machines and found this one should of been the strongest. My family loves french bread and in the winter months, I would make at least a loaf a week. I started the machine up this fall and made one loaf. At the end of the cycle the gear broke. It was still in waranty and was returned. I have been waiting for months for my replacement, it is backordered. Salton's customer service is great and would email me back if I had questions or if I needed an update on the replacement."
2,Soooo disappointed,"Earlier this week I returned my second TR2200 to my local department store. That's my second return within 5 months! Why? Because both machines broke down. The first wouldn't turn off. The second - after only one month's use - wouldn't turn back on! Now I'm a person who treats equipment well, and to instructure. (My food processor, which is used at least once a week, is over 15 years old. My 35mm camera lasted 25.)I give the TR2200 two stars because when it worked, it worked well. True the display was nearly impossible to read, but the bread tended to mix and bake to expectations. I'm bummed that the machine ended up being so fragile."
3,Really cute bag!,"I LOVE the way this bag looks and the size of it. Unfortunately, it is very very heavy. As soon as it arrived and I took it out of the box, I was shocked that such a small bag with NOTHING in it could possible weigh so much. This is kind of a pain sometimes, especially because all the weight is on my wrist. I kept it though because it looks so good!"
5,Ranma 1/2 Eps 1-161,"If this is a review for Ranma 1/2, I could hardly do it justice. It's an anime series that has to be experienced rather than watched. Are you familiar with the works of Rumiko Takahashi? Well neither was I until I watched and loved her InuYasha story and followed it by Ranma 1/2. Ranma is a lot of visual comedy, adequate translation, great characters and great story. The voice actors who dubbed this in English did a great job considering the time was rushed to bring it to market, or so rumor had it. I could have started with a history and a lot of details but why would you want a review from me? Happy New Year and thanks for Amazon!! ^^"
1,Trinity - Good GUys & Bad Guys,"Good Condition the quality of Movie.Was not aware that subtitles were not an option. Normally, I watched movies at home with my three children and need subtitles in English to read when the whole Family is talking. Wish they had said that movie did not have CCOld movie and it is amazing how slow the movies from past were for the new kid generation, but that was my decision to purchase movie."
5,This CD and Band both ROCK!!!,"I met Jarrod, Mark, Brad, and John in Los Angeles when they opened for Hanson. They are really kewl guys (not to mention cute!) and their music has a sound all their own!!! The CD has a total mix of alternative, pop, rock, and a whole bunch of other stuff all mixed in one awesome CD!!!"
4,Recipes Right on Target,"I've never used a book that produced meals that get more compliments from my Dallasite friends or Houston in-laws (and that's no easy feat as they are Tex-Mex experts). Matt's recipes are much simpler than those I've tried from other cookbooks while producing the same or superior results without having to soak chilies, grind them in a blender, etc. I may have to tweak flavorings some (hence 4 stars instead of 5) but the techniques and overall results can't be beat. As to how many recipes a person will use from any given cookbook ... well, in Dallas we eat a lot of this kind of food and I consider the money well spent."
3,Some good recipes; but book is somewhat pricey.,"Even though Tex-Mex food is on every nutrionist's ""Index of Forbidden Cuisines,"" I love the stuff. I ordered this book prepared to like it; and,overall, I'm glad I've got it. For one thing, nearly every item listed in the recipes can be found in my local grocery store located in a town of 8,000 souls in the Northeast.So, what are my reservations? Though the recipes it contains can expand your waistline, it is rather slender in scope. For myself there are about ten recipes that I would fix at home. If you are not on a restricted budget, buying this book may not be an issue. If you have to be careful with your bucks, then think carefully before placing this item in your shopping cart."
5,1st reviewer is Colloquial,"These ingredients are easily available by calling (512)367-5875. The NY State Game Commission might be able to expedite delivery. What ? You are so indebted that you can't afford a phone call to order the ingredients for your dinner ? Mabe you should call Dominoes, or Pizza Hut. For the rest of us, this cookbook offers real insight into Matt's culinary adventurism, and is highly reccommended."
5,Fantastic !!,"This is a bread makers dream. This is a bread maker that is high tech., yet simple to use. It has many features not avaiable on other makers, (and I've gone through two others). This machine allows you to customize the bread you want to make, various types and batters, sizes and crusts...and more.It has a hard crust feature to replicate the European crusts. It even does bagels that come out as bought at the deli.Sultan, the manufaturer, has another great product.You won't be diappointed with this machine."
3,A Quick Read,"Thin Skin was pretty quick to read and is written rather well. However, this is not one of those books I would love to read again and was pretty happy to finish. I can't say I was very impressed by the characters, yet they do have a lot of truth in them. Basically, it was an ok book..."
1,Trees should not be killed for this book.,"This is one of the worst books I have ever bought. I couldn't read the whole book. I can't believe all the positive reviews on the back of the book. I care nothing about the characters. The author shows no talent for writing. This book is a huge waste of time, money and trees! I really give this book a 0 not a 1."
5,One of the best books I have read in the last 5 yrs,"I am a sucker for a coming of age story but this one is a cut above the rest. Ruby is a very real, very disturbed, very fragile and beautiful protagonist and this book is a remarkable achievment for writer, Emma Forrest. For fans of ""Namedropper"" this book may come as a suprize. In contrast to the quirky, funny and loveable character, Viva of ""Namedropper"", Ruby is a dark and sad leading lady. Of course, this book is never dull and readers get to watch model, Ruby in her quest for love and her own self-injury. In a society where so many girls struggle with eating disorders and self-mutilation it is important for novels to be written on the subject. However dark, Ruby's path may be, there is a bright light at the end of the tunnel. This was one of the most moving, darkly complex and enthralling books I have read in the last five years. Few contemporary authors are able to engage me. This book was a one-night read. I read it cover to cover!"
2,Pretty Disappointing,"The first time we tried this unit we used orange juice, and it worked acceptably, but the result was not nearly as fine as we were hoping for. The second time we used it it didn't work at all. The mixture in the cups was just being spun around instead of being chipped up. It made a huge mess, the sorbet was ruined, and the kids were disappointed to tears."
2,Spend a little more and get something else...,"This thing works fine as long as it works fine. The range and all is okay. But setting it up for a particular frequency is a pain. It does not set to the particular frequency in the first go. Also, if you don't use it for a couple of days, is stops transmitting and the only way it seems to make it work again, is to reset the iPod.Even resetting the iPod sometimes does not make things work immediately.Infact, I am in talks with Griffin tech support to make it work... and it has only been a month, that I have had it."
2,Big Disappointment,"I loved that I could pull this item right out of the box and use it with the default station. It worked perfectly, in my car and in the house (it would broadcast on all stations throughout the house). I was in love. Then I didn't use it for about a week, plugged it into my iPod and all I could get was static. I tried everything with no success. I am so disappointed. I do not have overly high standards for the quality of the music but the level of static is hinders my ability to enjoy the music. It is going back tomorrow."
1,A real let-down,"I bought an i-trip not long ago and it worked GREAT from the get go. It was a biut clumsy to get to working, but the quality was beyond my expectations, after using a few other FM transmitters before it. However, I suppose I had the not so bright idea to leave the Itrip on the dash of my car, as I'd done with so many FM adapters before it. Next thing I knew, the itrip was dead. Nothing but static, no matter how hard I try.I tried looking for some sort of FAQ or something to help me fix the problem online, but all i managed to find on the Griffin website was the origional instrustion manual, little documentation online at all.It was a great idea, but too much hassle."
2,Not the best,"It does a satisfactory job. I also had trouble with static, plus mine would change broadcast channels at semingly random times which was a pain. I used it heavily for about 4 months. eventually it began to only broadcast through the right speaker, then not at all. in it's defense it did get jostled around quite a bit on the road & at work. So if you get one, do treat it as gently as possible."
2,Worked well...for a while.,"I got the iTrip as a brithday present in late March 2005. It worked very well. I used it in all my of my friend's cars and it worked fairly well in all of them. We had a blast listening to our favorite tunes. Although, about 2 months later it simply wasn't working anymore. No matter what I did it just would not work. I tried everything. It's now late July and I decided to take out that old Itrip and try to get it to work, but to no avail. This product will do it's job for a while, but it simply stops working after a couple of months. Do Not buy the Itrip. Those that praise it probably just got it. They don't know of the great anguish which lies ahead. BEWARE of the iTrip."
2,Griffin iCRAP,"This is possible the worst thing I have ever bought in my entire life. Not only is it rediculously hard to find a decent radio channel, but when I do, there is STILL STATIC.When driving I have to hold it or put it near my antenna and even then there are spots when static is bad!You want my advice: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT OR ANY FM TRANSMITTER!!The sound quality is terrible not even equivalent to that of the radio and there is static!Go and buy an in-car dash that is Mp3 capable if you ever want to hear good quality sound from your iPOD!!Once again, DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!"
1,Ended up returning it: stay away from it,"By now I should know better. Anything that broadcasts an audio (or video signal) with less than commercial broadcast strength or using FM airwaves (this saves the GHz portion of the spectrum, which is where wireless networks and cordless phones work) is bound to meet interference in the face. That's what I encountered with the iTrip. I was dissapointed to find that, no matter how much I tweaked it, minimal movements of the iPod with the iTrip on it were met with loud noise and scratch-like sounds coming out of my speakers.After several days of trying it in my two cars (a Toyota Echo and a Passat Wagon), I gave up, repacked it and returned it for a refund. My recommendation: stay away from it. I am now looking for ""wired"" alternatives."
1,iTrip - Expensive bit of JUNK,"iTrip quality fades quickly. Less than 2 months after purchase it was impossible to tune it in. This was the case over several free (nothing else broadcasting) frequencies, following the manufacturers instrucion.I did email them and got nothing constructive back just garbage that I already had which came with the iTrip in the box.It does not automatically turn it self off after 60secs no sound input and sometimes (majority of time) does not come back on without fiddling with retuning etc.Sometime if you are lucky you can hear something if you hold the iTrip next to the radio aerial.As regards other reviews where people say it works fine under stacks of newspapers I woulds place a sheet of A4 paper in the way.All in all I should have just spent my money on a good pair of portable speakers!"
1,Not worth the money,"I bought iTrip to use instead of a cassette adaptor in my car. I live in Orlando and could not find a station that was totally clear of music or talk. Every station that I tried, I would get static along with my music. I was better off using the car adaptor through my cassette player. You can not use the wire remote with this product either."
1,waste of money,"Don't waste your money - this transmitter might work in the tundra or some other desolate place, but if you live anywhere with commercial radio broadcasts, you will get a lot of static."
2,"Practical, but compromises sound quality","This thing works so-so, the real problem is the sound, once in FM sound quality is degraded considerably, and is prone to static and interference. Also volume output is compromised. Buy it as a cool iMac add on if you want to make iPod sound on any FM radio (does impress friends and family). But sooner or later you'll go back to cables. Good for car stereos without casette player, (better than nothing) but really only buy if absoloutly necesary."
5,Get it!,"This is brilliant, there are so many FM transmitters out there for your IPOD but this is the definitive. Just plug it in and go. Changing the frequency is no problem and the sound quality is not bad at all! get one!"
2,there has to be something better...,"I was pretty disappointed with the performance of this product when I took it on a road trip from San Diego to SF Bay Area California. Not only did it seem to put a good drain the battery, but also it would usually only stay tuned into a frequency for about 30 mins as a signal from a new city's station would come overpower it. Having to pull over every 30 mins to readjust to a new ""station"" for the signal conflict is a pain.Although it has a good number of stations you are supposed to be able to tune it to, I found this to be spotty at best. It would stick on a frequency and not let go, even if there was audibly nothing on the radio channel I was trying to turn it to... Although the Kensington has only 8 channels, for $20 more, I should have gotten that because the charger was built in."
1,"It's cute, it's compact, but it doesn't really work.","I love the look and the ease of this product, but looks don't cut it when you want to hear the music from your iPod in your car. Occasionally, I can get a good signal on the transmitter to hear the music, but it's sub-CD quality at best and mostly it sounds like a transmission from an FM station that isn't coming in very clearly. The music cuts in and out frequently and I've found myself having to change the stations a lot when driving across the county (which is practically impossible to do when driving due to the set up). I drive a lot in Orange and LA counties as well as San Diego and have found similar problems. Perhaps finding an unused frequency is easier in places less populated than Southern California."
2,all static no music!,maybe there just are not enough open stations in my area...but when i did find one or two the sound was terrible.
1,"Total useless, don't waste $$$","I give qa star is for the design looks fit to my ipod.I try to install the stupid software and follow the manual (old or new) the result is the same, unfunction.It cost me whole week to try, now I packed it and stor it in somewhere...You don't know what the device is doing? Just get the noise from the line-out of dock. I cannot returen it because a friend by for me from somewhere.However, all things are not as the manual saying, probably the reason is I use the Windows, how come a company to make the useless device just for nothing, I doubt the Griffin Technology itrip only support Mac, but they also wants Windows users to buy it. play trick????"
2,Don't buy this!,"We bought the Griffin itrip thinking that it would be nice to have a cordless way to listen to the ipod in the car (as opposed to using the tape deck.) Problem is the itrip can only ""broadcast"" at a low power given FAA rules, so the reception is like listening to a static-y radio station. I ended up returning it and getting the connection to the tape deck and am so much happier. Don't be suckered by the itrip's good looks 'cuz the sound sucks."
1,"WORKS FOR A TIME, BUT THEN FAILS","I have owned two of these. My first one worked great for the first six months on the default station. All of a sudden it stopped broadcasting. After installing the stations from the CD, I was able to get it to work again on other stations. Then three months later it died completely.For some reason, I bought another one. I like the compactness and price tag, but it was a mistake. The second one only lasted six months and then died completely. I tried all their recommendations and nothing. I now have to buy another FM transmitter for the third time. You can bet the next one will not be an iTrip!"
4,"Good transmission, but dangerous to change stations while driving","Like all of Griffin's iPod accessories, the iTrip looks like it's part of the iPod when it's attached, and it broadcasts much better than the Belkin TuneCast it replaced. The interface to change broadcast frequencies is elegant. It makes extensive use of the clickwheel, screen and buttons, however, and is a dangerous distraction if the frequency you've set has to be changed while you're driving. This would be a perfect product if it had a button that would allow you to change among three or four preset frequencies that you could set up before your trip."
5,PERFECT,Perfect product. Era el que estaba necesitando mi vehículo para solucionar la evaporación del agua en el sistema de refrigeración.
4,Heaven,I recommend this CD of gospel music and thoughtful sayings to anyone who has lost a loved one or who is watching someone they love slowly leaving this world for the next. It offers so much encouragement and hope with a precious focus on heaven and the truth of what we can expect when we arrive.
5,Jibanananda Das - The Poet of the Invisible,"""A Poet Apart"" is a scholarly written book by Clinton B. Seely on Jibanananda Das, the most influential poet of Bengal after Rabindranath Tagore. Poet Jibanananda, in the book by Prof. Seely, is manifested uniquely in an historical time. Prof. Seely has rightly brought forth geography, politics, myth, metaphysics, literature etc. of Bengal, in the historical sense, as the basis for the formation of the essential matrix in which the poetry of Jibanananda formed, evolved, and completed its transmutation from the visible to the invisible. Prof. Seely has done a superb literary work in bringing the life and poetry of Jibanananda Das to the English speaking readers, writers, and scholars."
2,BUY BLOCKS INSTEAD!,"Okay, tried this out with a five and seven year old. Both of them tired of it within fifteen minutes. I mean, how many ""snowflakes"" can a person make?"
2,Dated,The music is pleasant but dated. Some music from the sixties does hold up and sounds fresh today. This cd unfortunately does not despite the talents of the two artists.
3,Nice product - Bad Warranty and Life,"I purchased this breadman 2 years ago and the motor gave out after the production of 24 loaves of ""white bread"".My return on investment was bad. However it is better for you to eat ""hand made"" bread than to purchase the bread from a store where shelf life is anywhere between 2 - 3 months!TimSt. Louis, MO"
1,I see that Amazon has stopped selling this...,"...and I can see why.Ordered one in mid-January, it worked really well until yesterday. I've been making bread 3-4 times a week so don't think the breakdown was due to excessive use. I expect products like this to give years of service. It didn't.All the buttons still work so I know it's on, but instead of the paddle turning there is a clicking sound."
3,"Good product, Short life","I purchased the Breadman Corner bakery in September, 2005. I have used it about twice a week for the past 15 months. It has been a reliable machine until recently.Over the past three months the padle has been getting looser, so that thorough mixing has become undependable. Since I use of a number of the breadmaking cycles, it was a problem when the selector ""button"" stopped working this week. Naturally, the warranty is only for one year.Combining the purchase price and shipping, this machine cost me an average of $5/month. That's not too bad a price for an inexpensive breadmaker, but I'll think twice before buying another Breadman."
5,Great Bread,This bread maker is the best value. It makes great bread at a reasonable price. I recommend this product.
4,Best So Far,"This is the third bread machine I've had so far and after several weeks I've had good results. My main criteria in a machine was a 2-pound capacity. The machine has a good, heavy-duty pan that is deep, even for a 2-pound capacity, that reduces the mess that flies out and collects in the bottom of the chamber during mixing. It's been very easy to clean and is quiet while operating. My only complaint is the extremely long basic bread cycle (3 hours, 40 minutes) which produces a nicely textured loaf but required much experimenting to find the right amounts of yeast and flour to make a loaf that wouldn't fall. However, the dough cycle is short (1 hour, 3 minutes) and the extra features such as a setting to make your own butter are appealing, though I haven't tried them yet. Not a bad machine--the best I've used yet."
5,my favorite appliance,"I have had my machine for several weeks and it rocks! There was a wee learning curve (my fault, not the machine's) but it is now turning out loaf after loaf of delicious fluffy bread. I've had absolutely no mechanical problems at all so far. As long as I follow the recipe instructions (who knew it was so important to use all room-temp ingredients so the bread would rise properly?!)I get a perfect loaf every time. My family of bread-loving men couldn't be happier and I really believe it is saving me money to make my own bread, plus it is so much more convenient than making the trek to the closest grocery store, which, given where I live (Middle of Nowhere), isn't very close."
2,Beware Discoforme CDs...find another soundtrack,"What a rip-off! Discoforme, the maker of this soundtrack and others, makes no effort to highlight the music from this film, it just takes the unadorned soundtrack and reproduces it without any refining or editing...spits on the fine music by Max Steiner and gives you ongoing chatter. A very lazy and negligent method and that gives you a total of about 10 minutes of music and 35 minutes of yada type talking ON EVERY TRACK. This spoiled the CD for me. If I wanted all that talking, I would have bought the DVD. Interestingly, the actual CD lists the talking excerpts on every track, but they are not listed on Amazon. This is obviously the Discoforme way/method/shortcut, as another CD, ""The Third Man"", bought at the same time, and also by Discoforme, does the exact same thing, giving you ongoing CHATTER. Both are marked *50th ANNIVERSARY*. Do not buy either CD, and beware of the DISCOFORME trademark."
1,The AWFUL Truth,"My god. How can people to write these reviews. This book is horrible. The best thing is that she calls on God. As for skill, the writing is terrible and there are spelling errors throughout the book. The characters are unbelievable. The dialogue gives a low class feel to these supposedly upscale characters.Save your $4."
3,cobalt blue glass canisters,"These are a beautiful set of canisters; the glass is a true deep cobalt blue. Be aware that the pewter is somewhat dull, not shiny like in the photo. I bought these as a gift for my daughter. One canister was broken when the package arrived; the shipping box was not damaged. Another canister didn't seem to sit quite vertically; maybe that's from being handblown. Anyway, I was very glad I had kept the order info until the replacement finally was received by my daughter, because it took over two months and repeated emails from me to get the broken one replaced. The seller did not seem to be able to comprehend that the order was a gift, and the replacement needed to be shipped to a different name/address."
1,WINE RACK,"Not robust enough to carry 50 bottles - Flimsy, plastic base unstable , would be better with a more robust connecting frame"
3,Ben-Gurion's Spy,"This is a good summary of the 20th century terrorism and scandals involoving Arab/Israeli conflict. The author writes in a narrative form, making these factual occurances seem almost fiction. It is interesting to read and written in a manner which evokes suspense and unveils history.I would primarily reccomend this to someone with an interest in this topic already."
4,To be recommended,"Apple iPod classic 80 GB Black (6th Generation)A real good product.Needs an intuitive or young person to learn the functioning, unless you want to go through reading the respective manual to be found in the internet.In general exceeded my expectations."
1,Won't work on W2K,"Amazon should put ""WON'T WORK WITH W2K"" in bold type beneath this product. Finally got the great looking new iPod only to find I really have a $350 paperweight. Had NO idea that Apple has totally removed the capability to run on W2K until I tried to install the software (Amazon, you should have put a warning somewhere). Spent several hours searching forums and looking for 3rd party SW to make it work but found nothing. I have way too much $ invested in SW that will not run under XP to switch operating systems. Apple, gotta give you credit, you can shoot yourselves in the foot better than any company I know of (except maybe Microsoft). Don't need to worry about the competition, you can lose customers all by yourself."
1,Amazon disappoints a teen-aged girl,"This order was listed for 2-day free Prime delivery when I ordered on Sunday. Not true. The e-mail said it would ship on Monday. For 2-day free prime it should arrive today. They didn't ship until Tuesday, so my daughter's Christmas present won't arrive until the day after Christmas. And the ""help"" people can't tell me how to cancel my Prime subscription. Sucks."
1,don't buy!!!,"I purchased this IPOD and in less than a week the hard drive in it started making noises and quit working. Apple would not take it back saying that it was dropped or otherwise shaken severely. Since I bought it, I plugged it into my IPOD connector in the car and it stay in the glove box until it stopped working. So unless riding in the car shakes these things too much for the hard drive, they are crap. Don't buy one, stick to the generic cheaper MP3 players, or go with a more expensive one that has the solid state HDD."
1,Page---now!,I don't feel like enough people have been reading and feedbacking my reviews. can somebody please check out my page and read my reviews. see if there's anything that interests you. PLZ and Tank U!
3,iPod Classic,"I own a second-generation (20 Gig) iPod that to this day works and sounds superior to this latest ""classic"" iteration. In my opinion, each generation of iPod goes down in quality and value. Apple did away with the convenient and superior Firewire connection, also gone is the remote control cable that allowed for track changes and volume control, and they no longer provide a charger. You now have to spend more $$$ for the remote, and for a charger that should have been included to begin with. All this and inferior sound (harsh)."
4,Really like my Ipod - 1st Ipod,I wouldn't spend the bucks for one but my daughters gave me a ipod shuffle as a present and I really liked it. But i wanted more so I sprung for one of these and I like them both. It died in about 45 days but the apple service was stellar and took care of it fast. This 80G holds way more than I have. I use it when racewalking and at work.
4,"Pretty sweet, occasional issues though","I really like this, but occasionally I have software errors. I have had to manually reset it before. Also, the cover art is slow to appear at times and the ""cover flow"" feature is pretty slow to update as you toggle through your selection. Other than that it's pretty legit."
2,A big disappointment! Don't buy,"Unfortunately this iPod has been a big disappointment for me. I am giving two stars only for its storage capacity of 80GB. It can play MP well but it is not able to handle photos and videos to the extent it can handle MP3. Apple is perhaps over rating this. The iTunes software sucks, unless you have a backup of all your photos and videos it is not worth putting in iPod and it occupies lot of space in the computer for synching. I have to look for some other better media player in the market or wait until one arrives."
1,iPod is SUCK!!!!,"I think iPod likes to suck your money away, because there is no FM tuner radio, and it costs almost another $50 to have that. What's a stupid gadget!!! I'd like to spend my bucks for zune 80gb (2 generation) which I assume it's more tolerate with people's money."
4,not bad,It is quite dinged up but used. Works fine. Thought the fact it was wrapped in paper to ship was pretty terrible but overall I am pleased with this purchase
4,It's my first - and I love it!,"I have waited to purchase an iPod - why, I am not sure. But I will say this: what took me so long? It is easy to use, easy to download to...not to mention my new found love of podcasts.BE AWARE THOUGH: There are certain video formats that are not compatible with this iPod - so if that is a necessity, do your homework (I am disappointed in that, but I had no clue what to buy so shame on me for not being more diligent in my research).If you have a need for immense amounts of music...or if you are a podcast freak like me - this iPod will do the trick!"
3,Apple iPod classic 80 GB Black (6th Generation),"I am pleased with the look and sound of the ipod. Overall it is pretty good. My concern is that the dial sticks and I cannot always navigate from artist, song, compilations, etc. My hope is that it is just a slight glitch and not going to get worse and then eventually not work at all. I bought brand-new ipod so I am disappointed that this ipod isn't 100%."
2,A 6Gen unit based in 3Gen ideas...,"This is my 3rd iPod and I gotta say I am sorely disappointed. Sure, the screen is gorgeous and the slim form factor is great, especially given its 80GB capacity. But this thing feels very stripped down.The click-wheel is unresponsive, need to buy a proprietary $50 cable for A/V out (unlike 5Gen iPod videos), can't play 5Gen games on it from iTunes (How can that be given its BRAND NEW), and you get ZERO accessories (no wall charger, no dock, nada). The menus are getting cluttered it seems in this later version too. My new ""classic"" is going back to the store, and I'll replacing the drive in my older iPod. This is a case where ""newer"" is truly not better."
5,Upping the portable media player game ever time,I bought this to replace my 30gb video. I have no regrets on my purchase. The brushed finish is much easier to keep up then the gloss finish of the previous ipod. The redefined interface is much needed and a great improvement. Great upgrade and first portable media player.
4,good deal,it is a good item for the price and the amount of music it holds and it is always a good deal at Amazon. thank you
5,<333,"I simply love my iPod classic, I bought the 80gb a little around a year ago and it is still working perfect. The battery life is great. So thats a big plus on my side!"
3,80 GB ipod,the shipping was very fast. But i bought a 80GB ipod from you guys and you mailed me a 74GB ipod. I am pretty disappointed about that. But the ipod does work great. Maybe if i got a gift certificate or something i would be a little more happy
3,"Finally, more than 80GB!","20 years worth of CD purchases filled my current 60GB iPod long ago, with another 25GB still waiting to go onto the first iPod that would break at least 100GB. Glad it finally arrived with some room to spare, but hope it does a better job of navigating that quantity of artists/songs/etc than the 60GB did. Hope it sounds better, too. After all, that's what it's for.I'm not ready to give up the click wheel for on-screen nav, but was impressed with the responsiveness of an iPhone I tried (and I'm brutally critical). Still, you can feel and control the click wheel when you're not looking at the device (in your backpack, in the car) and you can't do that with a glossy screen on the iTouch."
3,There may just be finer things in life...,"The shipping was fast, but I was displeased at seeing that there is a magnetic burn on the screen (shoulda mentioned that in the discription). I'm restoring this thing as I type this, hopefully it's better than the iPod I have curently. I might come back to this store to get a book in the future because I like the selection. I DO wish that the iPod was in better condition though... X/"
1,do not buy from this company,"I purchased an Ipod classic 6th generation from this seller November of last year. I had nothing but problems from the ipod, but thought that it was operator error. I finally took it to the Apple store where I was told that the Ipod was a fake except for the back case with the Apple symbol and memory amount on it. I was mislead in what I was buying. I highly recommend that no one buys from this company unless they want to buy fake crap."
1,Be warned! Crashes every few minutes,"I just got a new 160GB iPod Classic, and I'd ray every one to two songs it crashes. Sometimes it reboots back to the apple screen, you wait about a minute, then it starts back up, and other time it freezes and you have to force a reboot. Sometimes it freezes so a snippet of a song repeats causing a loud buzzing.I'm upgrading from an old 20GB hard drive iPod. That one I've had for years and it's a tank. I've actually dropped it on pavement on two occasions, and despite a dent in the case it plays perfectly. Based on the many bad reviews, and Apple's 10% restocking fee, I'm shopping for an MP3 player made by another company now, though it pains me. I've always had a great experience with apple products, except for the airport express (3 died in a row within a month), and now this ipod. You'd think Apple would own up to the problem and fix it."
1,worked for only 2 months,"i am incredibly dissabpointed in this product. Loads great, great capacity but what does all that matter if the buttons don't work after 2 months. Please check out consumer affairs for this product before purchasing. $228 for 2 months use? who needs it."
5,Love it!,"Great product, lots of space to store all my music. I bought an Italk to go along with it, so now I can record lectures at school. A must have for college students."
4,"I like my iPod, I dislike iTunes","This is my third iPod and I love it, but I wish iTunes were not the only interface available."
1,WARNING ON SHIPPING,"WARNING --Amazon will not ship this in time for Christmas, even if you ordered it a month ago."
1,Touch Wheel is Horrible,"The touchwheel was horrible and erratic out of the box, unlike my previous two ipods. I called Apple Customer Service, got some Indian guy who put me through 45 minutes of bullcrap, because he did not want me to send it back to get a new one, then his supervisor got on, ""Jeremy"" and told me they could take it back but they legally had the right UNDER WARRANTY to send me out a refurbished one. In other words, I pay retail for a new product that is defective, have to go through hoops to get Apple to be willing to take it back, and then I get sent a USED one that has been ""fixed"" ie refurbished.Forget it. I'm returning it for a full refund from Amazon.I'm also going to write Apple executives about this policy, I can't even imagine its legal."
3,love the ipod but they sent wrong color,like title says the ipod is great and has alot more space than my previous 80gb. the only problem with my purchase is that i ordered silver and received black. would take to long to send back seeing as i'm on the other side of the globe.
4,It's an Ipod what can I say!?,It's an Ipod. I love it. interface a bit sluggish so 4 instead of 5 stars.
3,Not as great as original,"The new iPod classic definately does not live up to the original. It is very slow and freezes up all the time. I am very disapointed in this purchase. The 80 gigs is great, and it is very slim, but I would rather have the last version of iPod over this one. Overall, the performance is not that great."
1,Avoid the downgraded 6th Gen 'classic' - get the 5.5 Gen,"The 6th Generation iPod ""classic"" is a disaster - what a flawed and serious downgrade. First, if you enjoy music quality then stay away from the classic. Apple replaced the high-end Wolfson DAC chip with a very low quality digital/analog chip. The result is a terrible degradation of sound quality - very noticeable and very disappointing. They also locked the video out capability so you can not play iPod videos through your TV without purchasing a proprietory (and costly) cable from Apple. It is NOT compatable with older 4th or 5th generation software, games and accessories - you will have to repurchase this. The click-wheel is very difficult to use and very unresponsive. Cover flow is useless and needs to be disabled if you are going to get any useability of your functions. You would be MUCH better off if you can find the 5.0 or 5.5 generation - by far a superior product compared to the dismal downgrade of this new 6th generation classic."
1,BROKEN,"I think I may have the 5.5 generation but it's still the same basic product and the same company. Mine broke after one and half years. Over $200 and it lasts 18 months? Outside of warranty so I'm out of luck. You'd think a company like Apple would have the integrity to cover something of this cost for more than one year. But no, they want you to plunk down unreasonable amounts of money for some Apple Care Plan. Apple is supposed to be good quality. After 2 broken iPods I have to say I disagree. It's not like we're talking about a disposable razor here. If you buy one buy at Costco because they offer their own 5 year warranties. DO NOT BUY FROM APPLE OR ONLINE!!!!"
2,Avoid if you have an older computer!,"If you have an older PC or Mac, avoid the iPod Classic and go for a previous generation of iPod.The new iPod Classics are serious CPU hogs when they sync with iTunes. On my 1.8ghz iMac G5, for example, syncing my iPod Classic 160gb takes 7 minutes, even when there is nothing new to sync. Throughout that time, my CPU is over 95%, according to Activity Monitor. This is in stark contrast to syncing my other iPods (gen5.5, gen4), where syncing never uses more than 30% of the CPU.Windows users report similar behavior (Google for ""ipod classic sync crash"").So unless you have an Intel-based Mac (or similar post-2006 PC), stick with the earlier iPods."
1,I really wanted this to work,"Who would not want to convert hundreds of CDs to a lossless format on an iPod? Playback on the home sound system would be a piece of cake.Sadly, Apple's notion of lossless recording/playback apparently does not include the mid-range. In other words, no trouble with the treble - it's gone!Tomorrow my iPod will be also be gone.Tom"
5,Great Ipod but a Bear to Set Up!,"This is the second Ipod I have owned. The first one was a second generation and began to ""freeze"" and lose battery life. The new one has fantastic video capabilities and holds an amazingly large amount of music. It was also the most frustrating Ipod to upload, and I was assisted by a friend who is an IT Manager. The entire process took 12 total hours, including several hours on the phone with Apple Customer Service and finally a trip to the new Apple store in Manhattan with both the Ipod and PC in hand. As of now it is approximately half completed and requires yet another visit to the store."
4,"Good things,","I got this Ipod as a gift at Christmas time for my girl friend. She loves it. She used to carry around the old one. I was told by Apple, if I wanted to save money and return the old one? It was still cheaper getting a new one from Amazon and saving the old Ipod!Having one of anything never works out anyway. No, its good because now we can leave one in the Ipod alarm clock and the other she carries around with her.Thanks Amazon,Satisfied customer."
4,Still needs a FM radio,"The same ipod you all know, but still missing the FM radio. I like iTunes a lot too, but it makes a mess when you have .wma files"
4,better for space not for control wheel,i bought this ipod because i need more space for music and add new features i haven't in my nano ipod. All work fine but i think the control wheel interface is lower and less sensitive than my nano ipod.
1,Please do not waste your money on an I-POD,"Please look at any other type of MP3 players out there other than Apple's I-POD. My $300 I-POD lasted 18 months. Repeated trips to Apple Store ""genius bars"" produced short term fixes, multiple answers as the problem and sales pitches for more Apple products. My last trip I was told by a ""genius"" that the I-POD was not designed to last more than 2 years. That is a direct quote. Just look at amazon ratings and you'll see that there are other highly rated, cheaper MP3 players out there -- buy one of those!!"
4,Great mp3 player,"I just upgraded my 3rd Gen Ipod the ""Classic"" I was already using iTunes 7.4, so uploading all my music and photos was a breeze. I love being able to use the ipod as a backup for my all my photos. At first I didnt like the split screen menu, but now Im starting to like it. I like how you can preview photos and album covers. A lot of people have complained about the cover flow. Since most of my music is from ripped cds, I dont use it. I downloaded a couple of TV shows and the picture is very crisp. But I couldnt use it to watch a movie...screen still too small. Battery life is huge, and the metal enclosure is very sturdy. I also love the search feature. My only complaint is the click wheel. It seems my 3 year old ipod's wheel is more responsive. Other than that, I love my new ipod!!"
2,sluggish reaction time,"i returned it 2 days later, after i've found out ipod nano and old ipod are more responsive. how come apple allow supposedly new products to be released with less impressive user experience than the one they hope to repalce..."
2,review of Beyond Pritikin,"I had asked for the recipe book called Beyond Pritikin by the same author (Ann Gittelman) but was sent this book by her which is, instead, more of an introduction to the program.The book is not whaat I wanted although the title is the samew. ;I specifically asked for the reipe book, however."
1,Night Gallery Season 2,Night Gallery Season 2 is coming out later in 2005. But Universal is only making one pass color correction and nothing more. Universal should put more features on this.
1,studio rip-off,"Another prime example of how lazy, indifferent studio management screw up the best shows, totally agree with other reviewers."
3,out dated,"This book tried to be fast moving and keep your interest, but so many of the characters were outdated and one sided. Smoking cigarettes and drinking non stop. The days of those private eyes are over."
2,Kind of dull,"This book is reasonably well written, but hard to follow. The characters seem sort of dropped into the situation from the get-go, and there isn't much connection between how the plot develops. Even one of the major plot points is revealed in the book jacket, for no apparent reason."
5,Another Fantastic Aaron Neville Album!!,"Aaron Neville is one of only two singers whose voice can change my mood - the other is Eva Cassidy. Listening to this CD put me in heaven! I especially liked I Believe, Going Home, Ave Maria, and Amazing Grace.Another must have CD!"
2,halleluja,"I played this album several times, and I can only spot 2 tracks worth listening to:steer me right and I saw the light.The only good thing on this cd is its remarkable recording (HDCD)Warm your heart is a much better album.No....this one is better of in a garbish bin...So long Aaron."
2,"Be careful, book full of errors","This book has nice pictures but book makes some major errors. I would not recommend it to any youth for this reason. For example, there is a photo on page 41 with a caption saying that the men in the photo are marines in Tarawa. First off, they are not marines - they are army men (you can tell by the uniform) & secondly, the photo was taken in Makin which is part of the same atol as Tarawa but is technically not Tarawa. Ok, fine... I can normally let something like that slip by. But what is worse is when you turn to the map on page 9, it indicates the Pearl Harbor attack as Dec. 7, 1943. I had to close the book and toss it into the nearest wastebasket after reading this. If editors were sleepy enough to let this slip by, it seriously brings to question the veracity of what is said in other points of the book. I am not talking about them getting the date wrong in some obscure minor battle, but they got the date wrong with PEARL HARBOR - come on now!"
4,Hilarious Movie,"Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan werre an excelent team in this movie. This movie is better and funnier than Rush Hour 1. The time and the setting starts in china and ends in the U.S.A. Jackie Chan was kicking [rear] and taking names later with Cris Tucker by his side. There were a lot of action and comedy more than Rush Your 1.The plot was interesting because the one who in control over the Chinese mob fake moneyprocess was a friend of the father of the character Jakie Chan played. That person fooled both Jackie and Chriss by faking his murder. At the end Jackie found out and had to kill him. Also when Jackie Chan and Cris Tucker solved the case, they both went on a vacation."
1,NEXT!,"ok hear me out. When i heard about this movie coming out, i thought it was the same thing with only a twist. (Like how jack and his freind is drafted to a hockey team). That happens, but Jack gets thrown out of the game so fast, thats the only hockey footage they have. I thought that the monkey would kick some butt again, make a wicked-high slap-shot. But no. It's all about skateboarding. If you thought of getting this about a good hockey movie, you have better re-think it"
2,I was expecting at least a docudrama.,"So I was a little dissappointed that ""Winter in Moscow"" was a fictionalized account based on Muggeridge time in Russia in the early 30's. The characters mostly foreign reporters & writers are witness to the transformation of an entire society from a feudal state to the world first Communist nation. They are a sorry lot. This is a group that Muggeridge despises yet he was one of them. They enjoyed their life of privledge & luxury while mouthing the glories of the ""Dictatorship of the Proletariat"". They were either hypocrites or incredibly ignorant. It is however a reporter's story of the terror & hell that was Stalin's Russia circa 1932. Muggeridge was there."
2,I threw mine out,"I got rid of mine cause its such a pain to clean. Surprised to see people like it despite of this, I guess different strokes. Meat came out nice though, so not all bad."
2,Too slanted...food keeps sliding off.,"Am I the only one who has trouble keeping food on this thing? The angle of the slant (which exists to drain off the fat)is so great that I have to work to keep my chicken breasts from sliding off the grill and onto the counter or even the floor! No, I am not a cooking novice.Oh yeah. Cleanup stinks. Don't even bother using the little ""cleanup tool."" You have to use paper towels, and only when it's hot does stuff come off easily. I'm going to try the Hamilton Beach for the removable and dishwasher-safe grill plates."
1,Great Infomercial - Lousy Product,I have used my grill 3 times since purchase and I have found that cleaning it to what I consider to be an acceptable level is impossible. I do not recommend this grill for anyone who requires their cooking surfaces to be clean. If I had it to do over again I would not make the purchase. Maybe the guys at the landfill will like it.
1,Sadly disappointed.,"My husband and I loved this new grill. Cooking was easy, and cleaning was a cinch. What a vast improvement over our old model. Unfortunately, after using it several times, it died. I had bought it online and foolishly threw out the invoice. Since I can't remember which site I purchased it from, I guess I'll have to take a loss. At this point, I'm a little leery of buying another."
2,Looks Can Be Deceiving,"This Grill looks pretty with stainless steel. It is not made in the USA as stated in a search I did with the model number. It is too big for two people and very hard to clean. I would not recommend this grill to anyone. In fact, I am going to give it away. Very expensive for what you get. I have to admit, grilling fish for fish tacos was great, but the cleanup was hard."
4,Great product for the price $29.99,"I agree to other review on difficult cleanup and no power switch. For the price I paid, it is exceeding my expectation and love it."
3,Good product -Bad cleaning,"My mother gave me her George Foreman ""lean fat machine"" because of the diffucltly in cleaning. I have how ever found it not that bad, but I have ""lost"" the scraper and do not know where to purchase another. Cooks great meat."
3,It's OK...,"I use it occasionally, but frakly, if you try to cook a steak that has a bone in it, it reaaly doesn't work that well. and after a few months, the unit i got, did not cook evenly from top to bottom. Not that big of a deal, but you *do8 end up flippin the chicken more forconsisten cooking."
4,Sid,Bought this for our 1 yr old grandson who is just mesmerized with Sid. Great choice and thanks for such prompt service.
4,"Love the wireless, doesn't hold battery charge long","I had to have a wireless monitor and this was the one I chose based on reviews and cost. I saw a lot of reviews about charge/battery issues and to an extent, I agree. However, I'm glad that I bought this set because it still works well for me. I love the two parent units and it works well with my house setup. I've found the range to be good and I do not have any back noise issues. The parent units connect quickly and easily to the base unit. My only wish is that they included more than one charging station."
5,I love Dr. Perricone,I recommend woman and men to buy this DVD. I have it and it has work miracles for me. Now I have my own wrinkle cure at home.
5,i like the item very much,"i like the item very much. i got it for myself, but i found my wife also uses it for her hands."
1,hard as a rock,This pillow is half the thickness of the one pictured. It is also hard as a rock. No give or softness at all. Very disappointed compared to pillows purchased in the past.
5,Best Daytimer that I have ever owned!,"This is much better than described. It is very versatile. The daytimer has numbered days Mon-Sat. plus space for Sunday on each lower page plus 3 month & small 12 month calendar on top page. (small 3 yr calendar and list of holidays dates for current yr plus 3 more in front)I use it for notes. The steno book is perfect for to do lists or notes and you can easily take it out if you need to stand it on your desk to transcribe the notes. There is a easy to find page under clear plastic for quick notes. You could use for phone numbers but I use for my quarterly goals and acheivements.The is a large pleated pocket in front. I use for pending bills, a some take home work. Also there are pockets for 5 credit cards, 2 for pens and an I.D. pocket in front. All this zips for protection and convenience!"
5,Excellent book,This is a wonderful story with beautiful illustrations. It is just the right length with the right amount of words and detail on each page to hold my 5 year old son's attention. I ordered this based on other Amazon rave reviews and was not disappointed. Highly recommended for the young raptor enthusiast.
2,this Guy's in love with you,The songs on this CD was on the other CD all but two. Please list songs . I like the Artist.
3,"""This Guy's In Love With You"" by Arthur Prysock","I had hoped this product contained Arthur Prysock's original version of ""At Last"", which I first heard in the late forties/early fifties. Although I like the CD, had I known the version contained in this CD was not the one I wanted, I probably would have passed on it."
2,Not useful for intermediate business needs,"Perhaps this book, written as an extended tutorial, would be useful to absolute beginners or to people who have pretty basic needs. Because it's written as an extended tutorial, it's incredibly tedious, and you're forced to read every word of the prose to get info, and then, it's often not applicable to a broad range of purposes. If you feel relatively confident in this kind of software, I'd recommend going with more of a reference manual (I'll be looking for one next). Especially, if you're a fast learner and are looking to build quickly."
2,Evidently a Publish America title,No editing and lots of typos which really distract. Story has promise but would be improved with imput from an actual editor.
4,Impressive Literature,The chapters in this novel give you a front row seat to new settings and experiences. The theme is unique and most of the events keep you on the edge of your seat.
1,Piece of Junk,We are now on our second unit in 2 weeks and this one is going back too. First one starting grabbing up tapes within the first few days. After 2 ruined tapes I sent for a replacment. We have had it 6 days and the tapes are making a clicking sound when playing and the sound is distorted. It is doing it on both old and newer tapes. It will play for a few minutes then turn itself off completely. Only good thing to say is that the DVD side has not given us problems yet.
2,disappointing,"I usually love this type of novel--especially with the Jewish matriarcal stuff. But this one was so plodding and much too self-reverential for me. I didn't want to hear about her perfect--and perfectly trendy--meals and hobbies. I felt like screaming, ""Look beyond yourself for a change! Get a life!"" How many people really have the luxury to live like that: roasting chicken, writing poetry, getting in touch with ourselves...for a decade? I put up with this book to the end mainly out of a hope that Ms. Singer would reveal more of the other voices in her story but I emerged disappointed."
5,Every Mother and every daughter will love this book.,I don't have the words that Singer can conjur to make you feel so much. I am still waiting for more from this amazing author.
4,"i didn't read this, my friend did","I didn't read this, but i'm on the phone with a friend who did and she thinks it's ok. Actually, she's still in the middle, and by the way, she has a great relationship with her mother. She likes it and will probably finish it soon.I would love to read it, if I had more free time. I just stopped working, and I'm probably watch a little TV and maybe go to bed. When I retire from work, I hope to read this book."
5,gun battles'r'us!!!,"This is a violent movie. I love it. The first time I watched it, I was absolutely spellbound by the incredible shoot outs in this movie. When these guys start, they finish things in a grand way, especially the final fight which is nonstop, totally cool shootem up. The plot is not the greatest, but it does pull at the heartstrings from time to time {mickey mouse!!!}. This is a great introduction to Chinese action movies. And I must say that Chow Yun-Fat is absolutely cool at all times. He is the man... A real action hero!"
1,Can you say Omega 6?,Doesn't this author know that peanuts are notoriously high in Omega-6 fatty acids? How can you base a book on a high omega-6 food when we already have 20 times more omega-6 than we are supposed to? This is yet another fad diet book--aren't we tired of these yet!
3,not what I expected,"This is ok, don't get me wrong but it isn't what I expected which is probably more my own fault than anyone else's."
4,Good read-- informative and inclusive,"I just finished this 700-page history of colonialism in Africa. It was precisely what I was looking for-- a look at colonialism in Africa; who did it, where, why, and for how long. The only fault I might attribute to it is its emphasis on the white male players who made it all happen and not much on the Africans' perspective. Nevertheless, it was an extremely informative book that cut none of the imperialists slack. Germans, English, Boers, French, Italians, Arabs, and King Leopold the Belgian were all given equally (brutally) honest treatment. Good job, Mr. Parkenham!"
4,Comprehensive but with some omissions,"Massive. A lot of detail on Africans, often not enough on the international politics pertaining. Virtually nothing on how the three Somalilands came to be, on how Northern Rhodesia came to be a separate colony, on the few Spanish colonies, very little on Liberia or the Portuguese colonies. Brit author so much of a British perspective on things."
3,Not to kid-friendly,"The book states it's specifically for kids, but there's too much writing about caligraphy and not enough about how to do caligraphy. Also, more pictures would be nice."
2,"Jumpy cursor, nearly unusable for Macintosh.",This blog post documents exactly what's wrong:[..]I can confirm that the driver software kicks in inconsistently. The cursor is jumpy. The physical shape and proportions are great and comfortable. The software must have been an afterthought.This is very dissapointing.
2,No Way Out 2002 means New World Order 2002,"A very horrible PPV. Milwaukee deserves better. The only good matches were Austin/Y2J & Taker/Rock.Rock/nWo promo--Classic!Extras that could have been used on this DVD--RAW--February 18, 2002nWo-Austin ConfrontationAngle-Triple H rematch"
4,pretty damn good,"This movie is really good, it's just too long. Cut out the time when he was in college and the film would be much more marketable. EVERY scene that take place in the present is great - especially his encounter with the Russian hooker. Callie Thorne is incredible as his fiance, as is the boy who plays him at his youngest age. I'm sure that when it is shown on cable it will develope a huge following!"
1,You get what you pay for,"Netting it out, I wish I had not ordered these brake drums and would have returned them if I had had the time. The packaging was substandard and the merchandise came looking like it had been through a war. These Chinees made drums are corsely cast and machined. The biggest disapointment is that they were out of round and required machining, costing me adittional money and time."
3,"Excellent, but $379 each??","This is a terrific product, but I'm sorry: you can't get 5 stars for a speaker/lamp combination that costs $758 for a pair of wireless speakers and includes a couple of lamps! Maybe when it is $400-500 for a pair..."
4,Excellent concept - Execution could be better,"I wish somebody would write a concise tutorial of the matematics required for an ""intermediate"" book such as Dobson's. Undoubtedly for someone whose acquaintence with modern statitical methods is more current this book is a gem. For someone like myself who wants a refresher and whose math is a bit rusty it leaves something to be desired. Some of the theoretical derivations in chapters 3 and 4 (keys to the understanding of the rest of the book) would be improved by a bit more detail and a thoroughly worked example. A major shortcoming is the lack of answers to the excercises; I don't see how the book was published without them. If the book was 100 pages longer with the addition of the aforementioned material, I would have given it a five star rating."
4,Gospel,this really helps . Well done. I have always struggled with the presentation of doctrine from the past. I apprecitate knowlegeable reviews and reasonable interpetation and explanation. I believe that everyone should struggle with their faith and testimony. This really helps.
2,Fun But Not Very Helpful,"This book is fun, witty, and entertaining, and certainly will get you interested in playing serious checkers. But it won't help you very much.The book mainly deals in a disorganized way with mid-game tactics and end-game situations. Interesting traps and shots are presented, along with problems that are too hard for most beginners. That's all there is; just a little about openings, for instance. I kept reading and rereading this book thinking there has to be more here, but I have yet to find it.Read the book if you only wish to have your appetite stimulated, and then do your real study from a more complete book such as Reinfeld."
4,i recommend it,"this is a pretty good alarm,it came with everything it was susposed to.just dont buy a motion sensor because this alarm triggers it constantly.i may buy the same alarm again.."
5,Awesome Camera for the Price,"This camera is the one to stop on!!! If you're like me, you may be completely overwhelmed by all of the choices in digital cameras. I finally found this one on another site, and then came back here to read the reviews (the price was better too). I got it two days after my daughter was born, and found out how quickly you can use up a memory card and batteries!The pictures have been great! I got the cheepest 64mb SD card I could find ($28) and a set of ni-mh rechargeable batteries for $10. They both work great with the camera. The card holds about 75 pictures and the batteries will last through about two cards between charges. Since the set came with four batteries, I'm always charged! I've already printed off some 8x10's and they're in perfect shape.If you are looking for an inexpensive, easy to use, great quality camera, this is the one!"
5,Awesome little camera.....perfect for beginners!,"After doing weeks of research online, I finally took the plungeand purchased the Coolpix 2200. It's stylish, compact, and veryeasy to use. It literally took me less than 10 minutes from thetime I opened the package to the time I started snapping pictures.It's my first digital camera, and I'm very impressed. The priceis reasonable (under $150) for the many features it contains. Highly recommended!"
1,Pedestrian,"Uninspiring, average musicians. They don't even tell you who the artists or samba schools are in any detail. Instead of this one, find any recording featuring Mocidade Independente de Padre Miguel; they are among the finest in the world."
2,"Beautiful earrings, fragile and hard to fasten, NOT worth the cost.","This a very beautiful earring but very hard to fasten. I suggest you read the other Blomdahl Sleeper Earrings review before you buy. The Crystal is fragile, broke one within 30 days, it broke while I was trying to remove it. The hoops are all out of shape.Do not waste your money unless you have someone to help you or these are going to be the only earrings your are going to wear."
5,Great book,"This book proved not o be only satisfactory to me, but also to my daughter's english teacher. There are 4-5 different activities for each letter of the alphabet and each activity involves something preschoolers and kindergarter's are already familiar with, such as airplanes and bubbles. Each activity is a refridgerator paper and can be easily reviewed as well as inform those not so close-by relatives what your children are learning. Great book, would recommend it to anyone who is having a difficult time developing ideas for beginning letters."
1,Horrible,"We purchased one for our small office. Set up went smoothly, but it would hang in the middle of printing any job over 3 pages. The web site and user's manual had no description of these problems. The web site is particularly useless. 6 days after setting up the printer, the power went out. This printer never recovered, even though every computer in our office was unaffected. Don't waste your time or money."
2,"Watered-down 70s soul music, but not a Prince album","I wish sombody had explained this to me bofore I bought this album: 94 East is NOT the lost Prince album. 94 East was a Minneapolis band in the 70s. Prince, 16 years old at the time, played guitar with them. But Prince's current style of guitar-playing, recognizable to any Prince fan, is not heard on this album. Furthermore, Prince is not the lead singer (though he might do backing vocals?), nor is he even the main songwriter (he co-write one song on the entire ""album""). You wouldn't know Prince played on this album at all (doesn't sound like a Prince album, and no liner notes to explain what his contribution was) except that there's a misleading picture of him on the cover.Now, with that said, the album isn't bad if you're into lite 70s soul music, minus any hint of funk. This album IS listenable. But if you want lost Prince recordings, don't waste your money - you will be disappointed."
3,Cheese,"The flavor was OK, not great, Don't think it was worth the price. I often buy it for less at my local store and the flavor is superior."
3,Bitter-sweet,"The music is, of course, great.The commentary is informative and thankfully very brief.However, the carnival is from 1986 and the video quality is very bad.PS. Other than that, I agree with the ""wood Carver's"" comments."
1,Waste of money....,"Yes...I know the price is tempting BUT..you get what you pay. Took it out of the box put some gas and oil and the saw runs for not even a minute at a time. Total waste of time and money. Bought it from Amazon using my mobile and when you use mobile they don't warn you that you can not return it, had I known that it was not returnable, I would have purchased from a local store. Hope y'all learn from my mistake...spend more and get a real saw and buy from a source that you can return it if you have problems."
4,Godd saw,"Works good, chops small and medium size trees pretty well, takes a little work for the bigger ones. I probably would have gone with the 50cc if I could, but this works great for average home cleanup. It uses a lot of bar and chain oil though, I fill up the oil every time I fill up the gas."
1,Poulan PP 4218,"Purchased this today (11/8/10). I had a technical question and called Poulan 800 number from Lowes. Got David on the phone. It must have been David's first day at Poulan.I asked if the bar chain oil delivery system was gear driven or diaphragm. He put me on hold came back and told me it was a worm gear. I asked him about the tooless chain tensioning system and how it compares to the conventional method. He told me he did not know and I would have to find out for myself.Got it home, opened the box. The Instruction Manual is for a PP 4620 and was filled with legal boiler plate and very little about the workings of the saw. The packaging also advertised an extra chain is included. I had to take off the security strap to get into the box so I knew I was the original owner. No extra chain.Based on (16) four star ratings and (14) one star ratings, almost a tie, this unit is going back. Bad news is the Stihl I am looking at is twice the price."
2,runs great for 20 minutes then dies,This saw works very well for the first 20 minutes or so after a cold start and then it absolutely stops and can't be started again until it has cooled down for at least an hour. That's not what I was expecting based on the previous identical saw that I used for many years until it just plain wore out.
2,Too heavy to work with,"I've purchased this saw after the October snow blizzard in 2011, that broke almost every tree on my property. I was looking for a good saw to clean up the mess, this one seem just right. It came with a case, spare chain...Starting was good, clear instructions. Now the bad. When I started it, the chain was moving (very dangerous I think), after a few cuts, the chain started to stall on idle, like the carburetor was not supplying enough gas. After 20 min of work, I was tired, I found the chain saw rather heavy to carry around. I did not like the design of the choke either. it is very flimsy and hard to set to half-choke. I will be returning this item and looking into something lighter and better made."
4,Nice Brackets,"I purchased these to make a rack to store firewood on my screen porch during the winter season. I made mine 8 Ft. long & 5 Ft. high. It holds almost a cord of split firewood. I put a strap around the top to make it more secure. The brackets went together well useing regular 2x4s & lag bolts. The brackets seem very sturdy& of good quality. I might purchase more brackets to make outdoor racks with treated wood in the spring.The only complaint that I have is the brackets were packed with the paint wet and the brackets stuck to the packageing when I opened them. Also, the instruction sheet was stuck to the paint as well & was of no use. I did purchase these because they are made in the USA. The issue of packing when the paint is wet needs to be addressed. I give 4 stars for this reason."
4,Stack bracket,The brackets seem quite sturdy and easy to use. I haven't finished installing them yet.
3,To Do It Right,"These brackets are a good idea for stacking fire wood. You need OVERSIZE 2x4's for a good fit and stability.Oversize lumber is hard to get, Home Depot and other lumber outlets here do not have oversize lumber.Consequently, I had to shim and put spacers in the gaps that result in using regular 2x4's. I also used lag bolts throughout and also bolted cross pieces on the uprights that hold the wood. This gives better stability and strength. Since my stack was over 7 feet long, I put a couple of 3 inck cement blocks under the runners to support the weight of the wood.I am pleased with the final result, but disappointed that the project was so much work - due in part to brackets that did not fit my lumber well."
3,"Good, but design and instruction flaws","They do what is advertised and make a sturdy rack. Because you cut the wood, you can customize the size exactly to your needs. That's great. The price is an added plus, since you can make a large log rack for about $25, including the lumber.However, there are a couple of things that prevent a better rating:1) The holes on each bracket line up with each other. That means that when you pound nails in from each side, the nails hit or come very close. That leads to splitting of the board.2) The directions don't mention pre-drilling holes. Pre-drilling would probably help the first problem, although still would not solve it. The company should offset the holes a bit to correct this flaw."
2,Another Wannabe,"Can we get some originality here. How many more wannabe rip-off Warcraft games are going to be made...Geesh give me a break. There's another game exactly like this one, right down to the tutorial plot of hunting for wild animals, but I can't put my finger on the title of the game."
5,A life saver,"I bought a remanufactured cylinder head assembly for my wife's car and installed it. About 3000 miles later the car blew the head gasket. After a lot of research I found out the the remanufacturer milled the head below the allowed amount. The thickness of this shim gasket would put the head back up to the minimum of the proper spec. I sprayed my new head gasket and the space shim with a copper sealer, and reinstalled the head. The car has now gone over 10K and by all indications appears to be ok. Ford does not give a minium head thickness spec. I found the proper spec on an automotive machinest's web site. I fiqured I would have an arguement if I tried to return the head so I didn't, and decided to give this a try. So far I'm glad I did."
5,BEST WRESTLEMANIA EVER!,"In my opinion this is my favorite wrestlemania of all time,even better than wrestlemania xix.This wrestlemania featured one of the most historic match ever in the wwe.I reccommend this dvd very much to anyone who likes the wwe.This wrestlemania tops wrestlemania xix!"
2,STINKFEST 18,"This was probably the worst wrestlemania of all time. Watching a Hogan match has got to be the worst punishment in the world. Punch, Kick, Scoop Slam. That about sums up Hogan's moves in the match. Triple H had to sell his leg injury the whole match, which made his match with Jericho look horrible compared to there other matches. Don't waste your money on buying this ppv, go out and rent it."
1,WrestleMania XVIII,This Wrestlemania was one of the worst. They tried to hard to out beat Wrestlemania 17 and failed. The only good matches were Hogan vs. Rock & Undertaker vs. Ric Flair. Hopefully Wrestlemania XIX is alot better. I'm looking forward to seeing Brock Lesnar Take On Kurt Angle. What A Classic Match That Would Be. And the rumoured match between Rock & Goldberg. Hopefully we'll get to see the return of Steve Austin.
4,Funny!,"If you liked ""Dave Gorman's Googlewhack! Adventure"" or ""Are YOU Dave Gorman?"" (by Dave Gorman and Danny Wallace) you'll love this book too. The further adventures of Danny as he goes off on another ""bloke bet"" adventure, this time to form a collective with a thousand members. Once the members start pouring in he has to figure out WHY he's doing this. Very funny to read about how he goes about with his obsession and how he hides it from his girlfriend Hanne who is already exasperated by his earlier wacky adventures with Dave Gorman, chronicled in ""Are YOU Dave Gorman?""."
3,Good,"This is definetly a book to check out at the library or if it's loaned to you. It's a fun idea, and is fun to read. I really enjoyed the first 3/4 of the book, it was a very quick read, fun and interesting. But the last part really slowed down and lost my interest. If you get a chance to read it, do it.And then decide if you want to Join Danny."
3,"like a real life fight club, without the fighting","pretty interesting, it reminded me of fight club, only instead of mayhem there were good deeds. the coolest part is it's true, thats what keeps it going. i enjoyed the author's sense of humor. well written and funny and overall good read. it reads pretty quickly. it's a fun book."
2,Not that great,"You would think based on these reviews that this was the best book ever written. I was very dissapointed with this book, to say the least. Don't get me wrong, it's OKAY, it's just not GREAT. It's an interesting story of a guy who accidently starts a cult but nothing more than that. Just interesting."
4,great tea,I bought this product after hearing a great review on it. Whenever i feel bloated i just have a cup of tea before bed time and in the morning im ready to go... In order for it to take affect let it steep at least 10 to 15 minutes.
5,Best Slicer/Corer,I've tried many of these slicers and the plastic ones will usually break st the handles after some use. This one is made from cast iron and is solid all the way - you can feel the difference just by picking it and it has a protective blade cover. I've been very pleased.
5,wow,"Wow, I have recently become an hd freak and I must say that after spending a lot of money on hd documentary titles that I am finally very satisfied. This is a visual treat extraordinare - I can't believe that I am only the second person to comment on this work of art. Treat yourself and buy this beautiful production, I look forward immensely to getting the other two blurays in this series."
1,The Goddess'Guide to Love: Timeless Secrets to Divine Romance,"Rather disappointing. A fun book to read, but no real factual information. It's a fantasy type book."
1,Leaks everywhere!,"I have used this blender less than 10 times, and it broke and now leaks out of the bottom of the pitcher. Total waste of money."
2,Great till it leaks,"We got this as a wedding gift. It looks nice, blends great, but the pour spout is horrible and it leaks at the base REALLY bad...3 months into owning. Don't buy."
1,Burned Out!,"I normally don't write bad reviews unless a product really warrants it. I received this blender as a gift. I've used it 3 or 4 times. Finally, on the 5th time, I noticed a burning electronics smell followed by the blades ceasing to spin even though the motor was running. When I took the container off the base, a nice black smoke poured out. I also noticed shredded plastic all over my counter top around the blender. Now, it's not like I was doing heavy-duty blending; I was making milkshakes (ice cream, bananas, milk, honey, vanilla)...nothing too taxing for a 600W motor. I will not be purchasing this model again."
4,Powerful Blender -- Looks good,"I bought one as a gift for a friend, and my friend loves it. Whenever I came over to make frozen drinks, it had no problem crushing ice to the perfect consistency. My old blender never could. I finally had to buy this blender for myself.And it looks great in the kitchen too.The only problem is that the pour spout doesn't work. It spills liquid all over the side whenever I pour. Still, I consider this a minor annoyance considering that it does its primary job well."
2,"If you can't pour it, what's the use?","I just got this blender for my birthday and am reluctantly coming to the conclusion it must be returned. You just cannot pour whatever you blended without it spilling down the front of the blender. The squarish jar is about four inches wide and as you pour the contents come bearing down across the entire four inches. It's like Niagra Falls. There is no taper or anything directing your margarita or smoothie to the spout. Pouring out the corner doesn't work either; the angle is too wide.If only I could get my milkshake out into the glass it would be a great blender.On another note, several reviewers complained about motors burning out and blade assemblies melting. The first time I set the blender up and turned it on, it made a loud noise and the blades did not turn. It is very easy to seat the jar solidly on the base WITHOUT the blade mechanism engaging with the motor."
1,VERY LOUD,"I got this thoughtful gift from someone who felt they were getting me a quality product since it is Cuisinart. But, it is truly awful. The worst thing is how loud it is. I'd like to know what the decibel level of this noise is because it is probably off the charts. I'd probably use it more if it wasn't for this and the fact that it is really super heavy. Cleaning it is like a workout for your upper arms. And it doesn't clean up quickly. Apart from this it works good but this for me is a major downside. I wish it would break so I could justify purchasing a different blender."
1,Great from a distance...but don't get close up,"This looks and feels like a top quality model, until you start to use it. I have found that it drips everywhere when pouring, that the liquid goes under the nice brushed steel bands at the top, AND the liquid ends up in-between the glass jar and the plastic base of the jar, forcing a full take-apart everytime you clean it. I like the power, but would recommend any number of $10 blenders before this one."
1,Powerful but...,"This blender is powerful but it only worked for a year and it was hardly even used. It stopped working maybe the only time the high speed setting was used. If ever I used it, I used the low speed setting only. After using it on high speed for a very short time it stopped working. When I turn it on the lights go on and the timer works but the base does not turn the blade at all. There is absolutely no problem with the blade and I have checked this multiple times in an effort to fix it. The part on the base that rotates so that the blade rotates, just doesn't rotate anymore. I am very disappointed because this product was hardly ever used within the year that I had it and it should not stop working because I used a different setting that comes with it."
1,Not a good product.,"I bought it from Costco just 12 months back and it blown-up, it was too noisy as well. Jar was too heavy and was not easy to clean."
1,Waste of money: what happened to Cuisinart quality?,"I used to associate cuisinart with super-high quality. After receiving this blender off our wedding registry, I do not any more.I'm not sure if the sold out to a bigger company - but this blender is an absolute waste of kitchen space. It can't handle the simplest tasks. Don't even try to put ice in a smoothie. Soups are lumpy and it leaks. I am beyond disappointed and really hope I can save someone else the money."
4,Great Company!,"We bought this blender over a year ago and used it without complaint several times a week. Never smelled ""burned rubber."" Then all of a sudden it stopped working. Cuisinart told us to return it along with a check for $10. In less than a week a brand new blender arrived on our doorstep!"
2,Snooze alert!,"If you have insomnia, get this book. Filled with facts, maps, charts, graphs and other scientific research, it will make you think you should take notes. Plus you'll fall asleep fast. I liked his other books but this was DULL."
2,"Geology, yes. Story , no","If you're interested in geology, this is the book for you. It's probably far more entertaining than most geology texts. However, if you expect a story of the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, be prepared to wade through more than half of this tome to get less than 100 pages of the story marginally written. Mr. Winchester seems to have a penchant for taking jabs at everything he has a personal bias toward and not staying on the subject. Adding to the tiresome writing is the plethora of footnotes. From these alone a book could be written. Some are actually more interesting than the text. But they tend to disrupt any semblance of flow. A good editor would have been a wise investment. This is NOT a book one would want to read if they had the slightest interest in this historic event. Makes a good paper weight."
3,Bogged down by details,"This book is thoroughly researched and keeps as its primary focus a fascinating subject: the earthquake that leveled San Francisco in 1906. However, it may almost be TOO researched, as it shoots off on endless tangents about the process of seismography and the tectonic mechanics of earthquakes themselves. While this formula worked for the author's previous books, this one is bogged down by the tangential stuff and not enough focus is placed on the central subject - keeping the reader from really engaging the material.As a resident of SF, I should have loved this. In the end, however, I just merely found it interesting."
4,"Geology, history, and personal ramblings","Winchester writes about the San Francisco earthquake of 1906. He began with some accounts of the quake, launches into some geology, and begins describing a trip he made to California. Yawn. For all of this, his writing style seems overly dramatic. Then he spent a few chapters giving a good little geology lesson. If not for his dramatic voice, this would have been dull indeed. Instead it was quite interesting. He follows that with a history of California and the SF area. Eventually he gets to the event in question.I'd compare Winchester's approach to David McCullough's in ""The Johnstown Flood."" He moves through the destruction, looking at it from a distance, and then darts in for anecdotes.From ""A Crack in the Edge of the World"" you get a riveting retelling of the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, a geology lesson, and a quick tour of the history of the American West."
2,The case for a good editor,"I've tried hard to like this book, as I've enjoyed a number of Winchester's other works and have a keen interest in the subject, but I can't. The rambling, repetition, and digression (noted by most reviewers here) are not only undisciplined but also pompous, as if Winchester can't bear to deprive the reader of any of his overripe prose or tangentially related anecdotes: the prologue, for instance, with its contrived connections between Neil Armstrong's birthplace and the SF quake, could have been cut almost entirely. In earlier books, the author's love of small details brings the events to life; here, their indiscriminate inclusion weighs the book down."
3,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"This is a science text. A small percentage of the story of San Francisco. Mostly a history of earthquakes since the beginning of time. By the way, sell your house if you live anywhere near Yellowstone."
1,keep it away,"I would say that if you have other choice, don't buy this one! I bought a new computer from Dell last October, and this Astra 3400 scanner came with my Dell Dimension 8200, but I never get this work! There is always several ""colorful stripes"" showed at the image I scanned. Since I used to build up my own computer and upon my experience, I believe that's the problem of scanner itself. I've connectted with UMAX several times, but they can't slove it. They just asked me call for RMA, but they never pick up the phone. It's almost half year since I got this ""new"" scanner, but I never got any piece of picture scanned preporly. The UMAX customer service is really bad, and I've tired with all these stuff. If you do not wish to have those kind of hassles, just keep it away!"
4,Great album - only wish they'd put out the other one!,"This album remains as fantastic as I remember... I got chills listening to it, after all this time - I only wish they'd put out Axe's other album, with Forever and Battles on it. Still, Now or Never is one of my all-time favorites and I can't believe I waited so long to buy this on CD. It is a pleasure listening to it every time."
5,Great toy,i like it and so does my dog. Tug of War is his favorite game and this toy is a great addition to our toy box
2,Good monitor - IF it doesn't go bad!,"I've had the monitor about 2 years and it started doing that funky pixel flash thing that others have seen. Very disapointing considering the usual Sony quality.I thought it must be electronics going bad, but thanks to the poster below I took off the covers and was able to fix it. Or at least the pixel-flash went away for now.Just taking the covers off did not work for me. It still was messing up. But then I pushed on all the connectors on the main electronics board, and after pushing on the one that is near the center of the board, it started working fine.The connector I'm talking about is the one with a metal strap holding it down. You might want to give it a try before junking it. I'm hoping for the best..."
1,"Low quality visuals, boring, poor narration. Skip it.","There is nothing redeeming about this documentary. Stick with Home, the Equator series, or something from the BBC."
3,"Good general information, not a step by step guide.","The book provides information about many different types of composite materials. It discusses the differences in these materials and why you would choose one over the other. It is definately not a step by step guide nor is it geared to any one specific use of composite materials. This is probably a book for a boat/race car/airplane designer who needs to know more about the different types of composites out there. It also covers building molds and plugs; something more for the commercial person than the do it yourselfer. If you just want to build/repair a boat or a car there are better books out there. If you have no clue about the different types of fiberglass cloth and resins and the like and you are about to start a big project, then maybe this is the book for you. Just remember, it is not a step by step guide and it does not go into great detail on any one specific topic. It is sort of an industry overview."
5,Solid performance,"It just amazes me that most fire tool sets don't come with a rake. That brush is useless!So I had to find a single rake to complete my tools.This rake is solid, and is solidly placed in its wood handle.For the money, this rake can't be beat."
2,poor construction,"Although the design is ingenious, the construction is mediocre. The rivets that hold the lower arms to the upper body are fragile. The one I had literally fell apart in my hand after a few uses. If you aren't going to actually use this, it's a fun little novelty. If you want something that actually works, get a keychain multipurpose tool from another manufacturer."
2,Missing illustrations,"The fables are wonderful as always. However, the Kindle verson does not have any illustrations like the title suggests. My daughter and I were very disappointed."
5,Japanese import of the first Jumprope CD,"The content of this CD on Japan's Flavour of Sound label is the same as the American release. The differences are the typically nicer Japanese packaging, a large 16-panel insert (that is absent from the American release) with all the lyrics and chords in Japanese and English, and a different color printing on the CD itself. Great either way!"
3,"Sleek design, average performance","Images and text on this monitor are ok, the design is steril and industrial. Once you get close and touch it, it feels ""plasticky"" and flimsy.It is in the same price range with other 18"" LCD monitors but lacks some of their features, such as a DVI input or height adjustment.I would recommend the ViewSonic, Samsung or even the Mitsubishi monitors, due to image quality and features over this one any day."
1,HP customer support a joke!,"I bought this monitor in November of '03. I have sent it back twice and still don't have possession. I was told in February of this year that they would put a ""rush"" on it for repair. Still haven't seen it! I guess their idea of a rush and mine are two different things.I was a HUGE Sony fan. Was is the key word here. They will not replace it, sent it back once and said there was nothing wrong with it after having it for 5 weeks. I guess they don't mind having blurred print and discolorations throughout. I will not be buying another Sony product again. Customer support is now an oxymoron."
4,Amazing paintings graced by poetic verse.,Elizabeth has captured the art of pastel painting with the art of poetry and proudly presents it in this beautiful book. You won't be disappointed. What struck me is the size of the actual paintings featured. Good book !
5,Dogwood: Seismic,"Dogwood again, comes through with their new release Seismic. Seismic is an almost perfect album, a 4.5. The band goes back to some of their earlier styles of beats, bass, and guitar, but adds other styles as well. Every song on the album is good. A few months ago, the band had their trailer stolen at a show. Some bands may have called it quits after such a tragedy. Dogwood never showed any fear, and ""Seismic"" proves just that.af"
5,Fighting incompetence with humor and keen insights,"Self-help gurus and motivational speakers, beware! In this book, Pat Reeder and Laura Ainsworth take aim at nine distinct behavior patterns that breed incompetence and hamper productivity at school, in the workplace, and in society at large. Humorous real-world examples are lifted from newspapers from around the world and presented in the hopes of preventing the reader from repeating those mistakes. A must-read for everyone from corporate executives to elected officials. Highly recommended!"
4,Great knives and great service,This set of knives was replacing an older set. They are so comportable to use and the grip helps to keep my hands from slipping. I am only sorry that I waited so long.
3,An Average Start for 2002,"For the first Pay-Per-View, it wasn't half bad. Considering that just about all the superstars were in the Rumble match, they didn't have much for an undercard. The only good thing was that The Rock lost. The other matches were way too quick and had nothing special. I mean, how obvious was it that Regal would win with the brass knuckles. The best part is definately the Royal Rumble itself. It had a great finish, (just like HBK's fake falling off.) There were also surprises, like Maven and the Hardyz comming back. The Rumble was the only reason I gave this a 3"
4,Invicta Men's 8933 Pro Diver Collection Silver-Tone Watch,"I purchased this watch for myself about 4 weeks ago along with a similiar woman's Invicta watch for my wife. So far it's been a very good watch, keeps good time and is stylish. I've read a lot of bad reviews about Invicta's poor customer service, but I figured for the price ($56) if it breaks, I'll just buy another one and don't even worry about the warranty hassels. Again, for the money, I am very happy with the purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for a low priced watch.BTW- I reviewed this watch almost exactly as the watch I bought my wife."
4,Good,"Definitely for fans ""X-9"" is great though (they always have fun wiht making fun of sci-fi standards). Like listening to songs Mozart would have written for flutophone, with lyircs by Rabelais."
1,"Lame ""novelization"" of original ""The Book""","I ordered this a little hastily. It is a standard sized paperback with little more than the lines as they appear in the film.There is a FAR COOLER screenplay that is apparently out of print that you should search for. It's about 8.5"" by 11"" and includes lots of interesting extras - sketches and deleted/changed lines. I found one on another site that hosts lots of used books often for ""half"" cover price."
1,"Oh, PLEASE!","I saw this movie at a local video store, & like most gay men, I jump on anything with a gay story line, however, this little piece of cinema will certainly make me think twice about grabbing anything with two guys embracing on the cover that's not in the porn section. The dialoge was laughable & I winched everytime that ""Frieda"" creature came on screen. We did finish the whole ""film"" because we were laughing our (...) off throughout the whole thing. The only thing I can recommend about this film is that after watching it, you'll have a newfound respect for good acting, screenwriting, directing, cinematography, catering... You get the picture."
3,Not terrible,"I skimmed over some of the other reviews, and pretty much everything I might want to say has been said, so I'll just tell you what's helpful.Yes, the book is symbolic and slow-paced. It is, however, well-written, flowery prose that I enjoyed reading...to a point. The people who gave this book negative reviews were appalled by the graphic nature and the ""misleading"" title. Yes, the book is graphic, and not for children. In a couple of scenes, I would definitely even consider it pornographic. It describes certain things in a way that is both crude and poetic, if such a thing is possible (apparently it is).I don't think the title is so much trying to mislead as it is trying to be ironic. If some people missed that, then it's saying something about the IQ of the reader, not the author.Overall, I wouldn't say that this book has a wide appeal, but the author does have talent, so if you don't mind dark fiction, and a lack of a sound ending, give it a read."
2,If you like this sort of thing . . .,"This book definitely was NOT what I expected. The story was well written -- the descriptions were quite vivid -- but I felt a huge disconnect. Every time I picked up the book, I felt like I was being thrown in the midst, not like it was a story where I was actively following along. I also had a problem with the decidedly limited character sketches of all of the males in the book. When I finally finished, I was relieved at having made it thorugh, but at the same time, felt like I missed something."
2,Meandering and extremely tedious,"I admit it: I judged this book by its cover. I was intrigued by the title, the flap copy, and the cover design, and that's why I picked it up; it sounded like a subversive, interesting, anti-religious tome. Unfortunately, while a recurring theme of the book is torture, the only truly torturous task concerning this book is attempting to read it from start to finish--an arduous process that I'm surprised I managed. Steinke's excruciating attention to irrelevant detail and the two-dimensionality of her characters leave a whole lot to be desired in this ultimately boring novel. So much potential..it's really a shame. Not recommended."
3,A toughie.,"I've been trying to get through this book for a few years now. Sentences are long, prose is not as personable as some of Joel's other works. And it's just not that gripping spiritually (or metaphysically?) notwithstanding the title. A tough one."
4,Scorpions : The Next Generation,"My reviews are probably biased; based on the fact that I love all forms of metal. But I feel a particular trust toward this band's ability to put out a solid, all-around album. Kingdom of the Night was an extremely well practiced and produced commercialised metal album, reminiscent of the Scorpions or Warrant. AXXIS ""II,"" however similar in this manner, puts forth a completely new ensemble of ballad-like lyrics, excellent usage of synthetic effects between riffs, and the well-loved ""Klaus Meine"" vocals. If you like Scorpions, Warrant, Ratt, Poison, HammerFall, etc. you are practically ensured to be addicted to AXXIS ""II."" A must buy for the metal fanatic."
1,You do your best parenting before you have kids,"I was disappointed by this book. I know I did my best parenting before I had any kids and I guess Alissa is doing the same. What I expected when I picked up the book and what I got were diametrically opposed. While I am sure there are parents who push their kids too hard, most don't. Rather than concentrate on the minority I'd prefer she give help to the majority, she didn't! I have read many books on the subject and found hers to be the least help of any I've read in the last 16 years!"
4,Loose a star for not having the UNCUT episodes,"Just a word of warning - I have this boxset and was very disappointed to find that the episodes are the TV cut ones and not the uncut ones as advertised.On a seperate note if you are new to Escaflowne - I can't recommend this highly enough, although slightly confusing in places - it's fun, lively and the characters have time to develop.Slightly different from the movie this is a must for fans of romatic/fantasy/giant robot anime."
5,Simply Wow,"One or the most interesting and intriguing series in the anime. It starts out interesting and ends the same way. I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen through out the whole 26 episodes. Every character has a story and an issue he/she has to resolve. It's not just sward and sorcery, it's dramatic as well. Two thumbs up!!"
3,Not good for written preparation,"I recently purchased this book for my recertification. It was recommended by my co-worker and the reviews here seemed pretty good especially comparing to other alternatives. However, after reading it for some time, I have to say that it is not a ideal book for written exam preparation. It mixs the written and lab preparation, making it hard to concentrate for just the written portion. Cisco recommends that written and lab be prepared separately. I re-read the reviews here. It seems that all good reviews come from people who don't really use this to prepare for the written exams. This may be an a good book for work resource, but it is not ideal for the written preparation."
1,It was out of date and worthless,"I purchased it used on here for $1.00, so I was not too mad. Some free website told me it was a good book. Not really good after all save your money."
2,Things you can find for yourself online!!!,this boils down to free resource pages on the net. Ratherjust search myself.
3,"Ok overall, good deal for the price","This was my first LCD monitor and overall I was happy with it...until it stopped working (DVI then analog) after about 2 months. Now I have to pay to ship it back across the country in the hopes that I'll get it fixed in a timely manner. Sceptre's customer service is marginal. I'm using the monitor with an ATI 9600XT card on the DVI connection. As others have mentioned, I am able to detect some ghosting using this monitor while playing Quake but it's not real bad (I'm not a big gammer). Overall, it is a nice monitor and a big improvement in picture sharpness/quality than the CRTs I've used. At this point I almost wish I could take a refund and opt for a Sony, or at least something with a better warranty than the 1-year on the Sceptre. Assuming yours doesn't stop working it's a great monitor for the sub-$600 price."
1,You get what you pay for...,"And no where is that more true that in Electronics, let alone monitors, I had purchased the SCEPTRE X9G Komodo VII A, thing I was getting a bargain & it lasted less than a year! Out of Warranty & they want me to pay $175 labor costs, $30 Shipping costs, & that doesn't even inclued PARTS! Well, SCEPTRE SUCKS! Plain & Simple, I've seen old CRT's last for DECADES! & this was my first flat screen purchase, I must say that I will never buy another SCEPTRE SUCKY PRODUCT AGAIN!"
5,Perfect Reminder Of My #1 Film,"If you don't love the movie as much as I do, this might not be a 5 star album for you. Since it recalls the film perfectly for me, it makes that grade. Normally, I do not listen to tango music but again, it fits with the film. It is a very lush and beautiful score and, like all soundtracks, it has many repetitive elements. It is all instrumental. It can be very bold and strident at some points so be ready for that facet if you are trying it out over a candlelit dinner! If you are not a fan of the film, I would advise you to listen to selections from it first."
4,If you are heading to Amsterdam - this is a must have!,"Great Book. I used it allot when I traveled to Amsterdam last April. It is informative, has plenty of pictures, City history and extra helpful tidbits useful to traveling. The only downside - the print is just a little too small for my older eyes. But I''m still glad I got it."
3,Amsterdam,The book has some useful information hut I suggest you save the money and use websites such as TripAdvisor to research Amsterdam - and other cities.
2,Gained 5lbs!!!!,"I have bought this product and i have gained 5lbs. It didnt worked on me. I guess you just have to try the product. I just ordered hoodoba, on amazon and hoping that will work. Hoodoba has good ratings."
1,Dangerous,"As mentioned by others, these discs fall off. In my first real attempt to use the coarse, it flew off at high speed, slicing my thumb to the bone requiring multiple stitches. (Actually bounced off my belt before hitting my hand holding the sander - good thing it wasn't an inch higher or lower!). I've contacted microplane because I think this thing is a genuine consumer safety issue, but they have ignored me."
3,Oll book but precinple apply to all time,"I find these stuffes applicable to today's market too, so do not need to buy any more expensive books on momentum, this book contains them all."
4,What Was The Origin Of My Name?,"Like everyone else, I fantasized that my distant ancestors were noble lords, wise sages, shrewd merchants and so on. However, I have found that while all of the other German surnamed families with familial links to my German surnamed family have some form of an acknowledged coat of arms, my German surname apparently does not. Apparently, my ancestors were the cooks and chefs that kept everyone else well-fed. Oh well, back to putting the icing on the cake....."
1,very primitive,"Definitely did not meet much expectations which very high due to some over-hyped reviews here.Music is very simplistic (even primitive), especially given the hype about being 3-dimensional. IMHO, There is nothing 3-dimensional about this music (yes, I do own a good 5.1 system and quite a bit of good music mixed for 5.1). Recording quality would be ok for 1980, but it does not cut it for 21-st century."
3,"Nice music but not great, DVD overpriced!","I bought this DVD to enjoy an amazing sound experience from my 7.1 surround sound system. However, it was not an amazing experience, the sound was nice but not great nor amazing. I don't think it was worth the money. It should be sold for $16 at max."
2,Disappointing,"I've enjoyed several of MHC's books, and was curious to read a joint effort between her and her daughter. I got a bunch of MHC books from a coworker and this was one of them. I sure am glad I did not spend money on it. This book was unfortunately lacking in any flair or anything special. Nothing personal against these two ladies, but this simply was not a very good effort. It is a very 'light' read, without real substance. I found myself easily bored with it and had to force myself to finish it. Sure, there were a couple of interesting characters, like Packy Noonan, but really, this book is not worth checking out even for free. I quickly got rid of my copy."
4,meow,"this book is ok, but i never would have bought it. Thanks, Johann, for purchasing this book for your grandmother. but when i'm shopping for books i go into the store and you know i almost pass out i just don't know where to look!all the colors and shapes!what i need is something familiar in the title of a book, like the word ""cat"".in fact, halfway through the book i was getting a little bored with all the muss and fuss going on and what i did was i just imagined that all the characters were actually cats. talking cats.when i did this the book was a breeze and a half to read until the ending where the main character is killed by his own wife."
4,it is fun,"it is just a pc game but if you play it with friends and than it will be a lot of fun,i like it"
4,Deal or No Deal.... Just like the show,"Bought this pc game for my wife as a gift in lieu of the ""suitcase"" type that was getting bad reviews. I loaded it on the computer and just as promised the bald headed freak was now in my home. She and my two kids enjoy playing the game, although I think it's mindless... just like the TV show, but of course it becomes very repetitive and starts to bore them after just one game. Although I'm a loving husband and father, I did find the suitcase models a little plastic looking and likely coming from the same gene pool."
2,You have to use the CD to play this game,"With all these reviews, I'm surprised that nobody said that you have to insert the CD in order to play this game - really annoying. I don't like having to use the original CD - too many chances for scratches, fingerprints, etc. I read all the reviews before putting it on my wish list, and I am really sorry I didn't know this.The game itself is nice, but drags because if you play the 5 game challenge, you have to hear all the same phrases over and over again. But once you are playing, it's really breath-catching when you have to make those choices. If you didn't need to use the CD all the time, it would gain a couple of stars, for sure."
1,Extremely expensive upgrade,"I purchased the earlier version (Capture 4) a few months ago to use with my RAW files from the Nikon D70 camera for $120.00. Now that I upgraded my camera to the Nikon D80, Capture 4 won't read/open the image files. Nikon customer service tells me the only way to open the D80 files is to ""upgrade"" to Capture NX for ANOTHER $89.00!I am not spending $89.00 (upgrade) just to keep using my Nikon software purchased few months ago.NX appears to be a solid software but Nikon obviously has some software customer service issue."
4,Useful program,"Though I am proficient with Ken Turkowski's freeware app, DeFish, Capture NX was purchased simply to facilitate correction of fisheye distortion. It works well enough at this. I am not sufficiently familiar with its other features to compare it with Photoshop Elements, the program I seem to start up more than any other to work with photos, including fisheyes."
4,Works well,"This arrives as two separate packages, each containing one screen protector of exactly the correct size to fit the intended device (in this case, a Sony Cyber-shot DSC-H5 digital camera.)Having installed similar screen protectors on Treos and earlier Palm products, I consider this item both very effective and easy to use. The plastic is thick enough to handle easily, and the adhesive has just the right amount of tackiness to both allow slight repositioning and firm adhesion once properly positioned. I also found it relatively easy to avoid the problem of trapping air bubbles under the protector. (The package also includes a handy tool to help avoid trapping bubbles during installation.)I'd rather have bought only one screen protector, but it was a bit comforting to know that if I somehow ruined my first attempt to install the protector I'd still have a second chance."
5,"Great Lantern, especially in a pinch!","I recently went through Hurricane Sandy, with the power out for three weeks, this little light worked amazing. All you do is wind it and press the button and you have a seemingly endless supply of light! I have other wind up lanterns that dim quickly and need to be rewound. Not this little lantern, this is a phenomenal must have around the house. No need to hunt for batteries, just grab it and go! A must have around any household! Also, has a nifty carabiner on the top to clip to a belt loop or a pocket or hang somewhere while working on a car or around the house."
4,"Smaller than expected, but works well","This lantern is smaller than a can of soda, but it seems to be well-built, puts out a decent amount of light, and holds a charge very well. I wish the battery compartment was easily accessible so that the battery could be disconnected for long-term storage. I also think it would have been cheap enough to include the recharging cords/connectors without costing the manufacturer too much, and even with the relatively low cost of this item that would have been a nice addition."
2,Great Idea...doesn't light!,"I bought this lantern for a trip to Central America. I am going to be in the jungle with no electricity at night. I thought it would be perfect to carry with me to the bathroom and to read or write at night. I will be gone for 3 months, and didn't want to have to worry about batteries. I got the lantern today and I have been winding it for about 25 minutes. My arm hurts, and the lanter will not light. The only time it glows is if i turn it on while I am winding it. The instructions say that winding it for one minute, at 120 cranks a minute, should light the LED for an hour. If that were true I would love it...but it's not, so I am returning it!"
1,Bags not for Kenmore Blue Canister,"I was mislead by your page, and I bought these bags to go with the Kenmore Canister vaccuum cleaner. They don't work! Beware future buyers."
1,Not Kenmore Q bag,This bag is not a replacement for Kenmore Q bags even though they come up in the search results for Kenmore Q vacuum bags.
4,Magic Blue Canister Bags,"These little bags are very hard to find! My local Sears store doesn't even carry them, so I was pleased to find these on Amazon.com. They fit perfectly and work well."
2,Not Great,"With flat, undeveloped characters, a forced romance and an obvious culprit, there wasn't much to like about this book. I've read many of this author's other books and know she's capable of so much more."
5,A very spiritual album indeed!,"This was Richie's second solo lp. mixing secular songs with some deeply spiritual yet unobtrusive tunes. ""You can live forever, forever and a day, Just say it whenever, Aint no taking it away."" I really appreciated this record because he seems to be comfortable with his new found spirituality and his folk background, a mix he would carry on with some of Maranatha! Musics' praise albums-no mistaking that tenor! I wasn't a Christian when I bought his first solo album and it seemed 'foreign' to me, backed by strange musicians, who I later found out to be 3/4's of Lovesong. But this, followed by Dylan's Slow Train,...well, it was a great time for me to enter into faith. And this is a great sophmore effort!"
2,I should have known better,"The price was right($20), that should have been my first clue to the poor quality.The sound was ok at best. Low end was a bit muffled and the high's were not crisp.They blocked out un-wanted noise out adaquately, but the inter-changable buds are prone to falling off and getting lost way to easily. There is no case or protective pouch for storage. The gauge of the wire is too thin and the jacket of the wire is easily damaged. The in-line volume control switch feels cheap and flimsy, like it ready to break apart.I did not expect awesome sounding headphones for $20. For the price, I expected a decent sounding pair that was well constructed so it could take some abuse.I cannot recommend these headphones based on the poor construction and vunerability of the earbuds getting lost.Do not waste your money on these headphones. keep looking and be prepared to spend a little more. It will be worth it in the long run."
5,Great,I purchased this for my daughter. She just loves it and the styling. You can't go wrong for the price!
4,unique and fun,I think that this flatware is definitely a bargain. So much more fun than my old plain flatware. I enjoy eating with it and seeing it in my drawer.
4,Great for the boat,"As other people have commented, this is not classy stuff... it's a little rough around the edges. But it has replaced the hodge-podge that I've been using in my kitchen for years, and I like the heft and design. It also feels solid without any more weight than necessary, thanks to the slot in the handle. I use these on my weight-sensitive boat instead of dinky plastic stuff, and find them very civilized. For the price, I can't imagine doing better."
1,Thin chintzy Flatware,I did not like the quality of the flatware. They are thin stamped metal. I donated them to St Vincent after using for a few weeks.
1,Low audio quality,All that the first reviewer has said about this CD I can confirm exept the missing track. When I have bought this CD at Rykodisc London in 1998 I was hardly disappointed about the quality of this issue. It was not only mastered from a mono source but obviously noise reduction was applied to it removing all low frequencies. Therefore it sounds flat and cold.Since the mentioned review was the only negtive one I thought that Rykodisc has corrected their problems with this CD. But my recent purchase confirms the contrary.All those people who own the original stereo vinyl LP can be lucky. This CD is no real replacement for the LP.The correct listing of the tracks:1. Pele2. Fire Down Below3. Ye Lei Sian4. Hana Pele5. Hana Maui6. Cumana7. Scheherezade8. Cubana Chant9. Magic Island10. Tropical11. Fascination12. 76 Trombones
1,pile of junk,the software is awful. the picture quality is even worst..unless you like faded glazed over pictures...don't buy this one..one star is one too many for this bogus item.
1,BEWARE product is no longer supported by Sony,"Sony has discontinued ALL support and no longer sells or supports the Theme packs. The use of the package is reliant on the content theme packs. While the package comes with some, Sony previously had a wide selection. Sony Creative Software has not provided existing customers any possible means to continue to get content for this product and no indication of product future direction with regards to a replacement, access to theme packs or upgrade."
5,Excellent!,"As one who never paid much attention to Amy Winehouse, I found this video to be totally captivating. I have watched it over and over with friends and have yet to tire of watching it. Love it. The documentary is also very good that goes with it."
4,Chooch Cable Reels,Searched far and wide for a 'cable reel' for a model traction work train I was building when I found these reels from Chooch. Indeed they are perfect for my work flat and the extras will certainly find homes elsewhere on my layout. As they are also available in different scales they can be used in many different configurations.
3,OK deal,Was an ok deal but not worth the price and there are cheaper store bought soaps that do the same thing.
1,Avoid,"I bought one for me and three others as gifts for family members. Big mistake not reading reviews first. The first one I opened did not charge with either using the plug-in or leaving it in direct sunlight all day. In fact the charge light never even turned on. Then after I put in batteries, the flashlight part would not work. So, hoping it was just a lemon, I opened the next one and it was the same darn thing. Plus the siren function didn't work. I'm going to return the other two without even trying them. I'm disgusted."
5,Survival knife,Absoulty one of the best survival knifes out there..Great for a prepperThis is a mustGet thisHigh Quailty features .all described 100%5. StarsGreat for hunting..
2,An OK reference,"Some of the chapters are heavily Microsoft biased. I was expecting more of a reference manual so I was disappointed. And even the reference chapters aren't that clearly written--though some are.For the price, I'd look somewhere else for a BackOffice reference. (P.S. The included CD didn't come with all the books that the cover claimed it came with...)"
2,Not geared for small businesses,"I was hoping to get more ideas for my small retail business. Not at all what I was hoping for. It is mostly sleek, high-end boutiques."
3,OK GENERIC CRIME FILMS,"The title movie, BIG GUNS, is a very good print for such a cheap-priced collection. It has a good car chase, some blood, and a stupid ending. Richard Conte is briefly even in it, with a GODFATHER type wedding---though the dumb director keeps on cuting away from Conte while he delivers his lines!VIOLENT PROFESSIONALS also has a Richard Conte cameo---and two DIRTY HARRY type murders in the first 10 minutes. It also has goofy direction; Jess Franco zooms and Sergeo Leonne tight close-ups of faces."
2,You'd better have good hearing.,"I recently purchased the Anycom Blue Car Kit. The main purpose is to provide you with hands free phone conversations, in your car, with any blue tooth capable phone. It was easy to connect to my phone and, being cordless, you can place it most anywhere. The problem is the volume. People could hear me but the speaker was severely underpowered. I would not recommend this product."
5,Convenient,"Love it. Good quality made with good material , I recommend it to all. Which it had more hooks though"
4,Nice,Good quality cedar for belt organization. Spaced far enought apart to accommodate different buckle style and sizes. Might need a second one soon!
5,it's nice,"plenty of space for 1 belt on each hook. even space for 2 belts on each hook, although it sounds silly to put more than 1 belt on a hook. cedar wood looks nice and construction is worth the price"
4,Pretty darn good,"If you took Fig Newtons and sesame seeds and ran them in a blender together then patted it all back into a bar shape, thats sorta how these taste. I can't quite say I love them, but I like them alot."
4,VOIP Stereo Headset,I just got this headset and have been using it with Skype. So far it works great and has excellent sound quality. The ear pieces are comfortable but may be a little tight for some people. It seems sturdy but the real question now is to see how long it lasts without breaking.
3,Its okay,"I had to buy this for an online class, and it works fine. However, I find it very uncomfortable to wear for any length of time."
5,great,"Just what we needed to repair a bed frame that we lost the clamps for, worked great and frame is holdong together."
5,Cheapest class you will ever take,"This book is the cheapest class you may ever have, and it is a good class. As you may have noticed there are not many books written on Captivate. It's a shame because Adobe's Captivate really is great program.I am a freelance web designer and Flash animator in the Seattle market. Last year I wanted to learn Captivate and realized there are no classes in the Puget Sound area and only 3 books on the market.I purchased this one and it taught me the program just working on the exercises at night. The book has not typos, a nice flow and they cover most of the program. It is a productive book and you see results quickly. Since then I have added E-learning to my list of skills I offer thanks to this book and the Adobe's Captivate.I do admit I also purchase the Visual Quick Start book. But when I need to reference something I go to Essentials first. I will look at the example in the exercise I did and it will click right away, ""Oh that's how I did it""."
2,Poorly translated,"This was a very awkward read due, I believe, to poor translating. It had detailed information about the natural environment of the fish, but lacked any care instructions and specifications for specific fish in captivity. And the best pictures were in pull-out poster. It was not what I was expecting."
4,Endearing,I love this movie! It is such a sweet love story and Reeves and Seymour are amazing together. Great chemistry! If you want a good old fashioned love story that will make you weep and say ahhh......get this!
5,memorable,"i introduce my then 8 years old daughter to this movie 6 years ago and even after watching Titanic 8 times she would tell you that this movie it's her favorite of all times so far.she ,being an actor herself at the san diego school of creative and performing arts she would know better to affirm that this movie it's memorable. and although we don't own it we rent it 10 times a year at least!"
4,The Romance of What Might Have Been....,"""Somewhere In Time"" does not boast great acting, particularly from Mr. Reeve, but what it does do is remind us of our losses and how they can tug at your heart throughout your life. This film is about love - and not especially just romantic love. We all would like to have 5"" with someone we have lost, to tell them how much we love them. We would like that chance to go back and perhaps do or say things differently. This surely must exist in a small place in the corner of all our hearts, and this film finds that corner.I would like to have seen someone more convincing in the lead role, but Reeve does his best and Seymour is the epitome' of beautiful femininity, as always. It is visually and musically lush (a more romantic soundtrack could not have been found). It is also nice to see Christopher Plummer and Teresa Wright in supporting roles. If you are a romantic, this film will haunt you - and remind you of the best part of your lost love...."
4,Best Christopher Reeve Romance,"We are all saddened by Christopher Reeves passing. Most of us know him as Superman, but a few know some of his dramatic and romantic roles as well. I have seen almost everything he has done and this to me is his best romantic role. Christopher and Jane Seymour are wonderful as the couple from different time periods that fall deeply in love and then are separated by their times. A coin plays a pivotal part in separating them, but love can not be denied. Heartbreaking and terribly romantic with a wonderful ending. A great price for this DVD. The quality of the picture and sound is excellent. If you like this be sure to catch Reeve in ""The Aviator"" too."
5,Most Romantic film ever!!,"This is the best romantic film I have ever seen!!! Even though it is over 30 years old, the imagery, music, & script cannot be beat!"
2,"It's a great movie, but the DVD sucks!","I love the movie, but I was really disappointed in the DVD version. The quality just was awful. The reason that people buy DVD's is for the improved video and audio quality. The bad thing about the DVD is that the audio is FREAKIN' 2.0 MONO!!!! It sounds like it's being played in a bucket.I love the film, and the soundtrack, but 2.0 MONO???? It's not even in STEREO, let alone Dolby Pro logic surround. All DVD's tend to have at least 5.1 Dolby Digital - but Freakin' 2.0 MONO?I'm disappointed in the DVD, I never thought that a studio would have the guts to release something on DVD with such horrible sound. What are they trying to pass off on us?If they ever make a release that is AT LEAST 2.0 STEREO then I'm going to ask for a free exchange for them trying to pass of this MONO garbage on me."
1,Awful,Do not buy this movie. It is literally the worst DVD transfer I have ever seen. I thought one of the previous reviewers was kidding when he said his VHS copy was cleaner. It is extremely grainy and very bad. You WILL be disappointed.
5,The best movie I've ever seen!!!,"There are no words to describe how this movie entraps you from the first few minutes. It had me sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for more. I was sad when it ended and only hoped for a sequel that was to never be. And now shall never come, with the fate of Christopher Reeves. Wonderful movie! Art Bell lovers will find it truely entertaining."
5,Time manipulation - romance,"I enjoy watching this movie more than once because I like time travel, and romance. I have been to the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island, and that makes it even more fun to watch. When I visited the hotel, they were showing the movie in the Cupola Bar! Cool."
1,So Bad I Couldn't Even Finish Watching It...,"I figured when I bought this movie that hundreds of other reviewers couldn't be wrong, right? Wrong. This movie is so sappy, so overwrought and so predictable (and, I would argue, so poorly acted) that I could not even finish watching it. Seriously, I have watched thousands of movies (I love watching movies of all types) and I have only turned off about 3 in my lifetime. This is one of them. Wish I could have that 45 minutes of my life back."
5,Somewhere in time,I have loved this movie since I was a young girl. Beautifully made and extremely romantic. They don't make movies like this anymore.
5,Classic Romance,It is a real pleasure to see the widescreen format rather than the usually shown pan & scan.
5,Great chick flick,"Somewhere in Time is based on the novel Bid Time Return.Starring Jane Seymour, before she was Dr. Quinn, this is a romantic story revolving around time travel. Great chick flick to watch on Sunday afternoon."
5,One of the most romantic love stories ever!!!,"This movie is, by far, one of the most romantic movies ever made! If you want a good movie to cuddle up with your sweetheart with... this is it!Deep, honest acting... Reeve is great in this.This is a movie that my mother introduced to me as a young boy. The love story of all love stories. I'm a guy, and truly fell in love with this movie."
4,Challenges You to Pay Attention,"There is more to ""Time"" than I could absorb in one watching. The love story is simple enough, but the many-sided nuances of the story are hidden in almost every corner of the movie, and they don't reveal themselves to lazy or superficial examination. Trying to burden oneself with the minutia of time-travel theory simply complicates the story for the first viewing, or two. However, the nuances of the two lover's interplay across time is important to the story from the very beginning, as I found out.I missed many of the facets of the story the first time through and I can see why so many have an almost a cultist fascination with ""Time."" A captivating movie that, like a good book, challenges you to pay attention and then rewards you with the type of ending that really makes you wish there was a sequel, or two, waiting in the wings."
4,somewhere in time dvd,"This was a delightful film. The music alone makes it well worth watching. Seeing a young Christopher Reeve was sad but he did his best with this story, a bit ""smaarmy"" but I enjoyed it."
3,"A checklist of Islamic Coins, Stephen Album","For those who can read the inscriptions, this book has a wealth of information about the many types of Islamic coins and their issuers. A twelve page introduction provides an overview. But there are no photographs and no transcriptions of the Arabic writing. The book is, in the author's own words, ""altogether worthless as an identification guide...."" So if you happen to have some of those coins with mysterious writing on both sides and are just looking for help identifying them, don't waste your money here."
2,confused by an Amazon fan,"Help! My recent purchased series 8 seems to visually fracture and breakup for a good portion of the earlier part on each disc. After a time the problem straightens out and I can follow the episodes just fine. I thought it might be my dvd drive, but renting an English older movie, found the picture was perfect from beginning to end. Perhaps my dvd player is getting old, but why did this individual movie play perfectly? I do not know. This problem stands for all recent purchases of Little House on the Prairie even prior year. I am disappointed since I adore this series and appreciate Amazon for making these copies of this wonderful tv show."
5,Loved it!!,"I bought Little House on the Prairie from somewhere other than Amazon, because I just couldn't wait any longer, and I found it to be sensational. Great picture quality and sound, though low somewhat it still wasn't bad when down low. Great addition for any Little House fan's collection!"
1,Really horrible.,Could they have picked a more useless Emoesque King Arthur? Just seeing this actor on film was painful. Merlin was also annoying. This was a really bad reboot. For gods sake get a MAN to play Arthur. Ugh!
3,"STOPPED A FEW TIMES, but show is great..",Watching here is like ROKU...stops and starts on AMAZON....I thought the show is well done and EVA GREAT IS EVIL...people die faster her for sure....will watch the rest ON DEMAND now.
3,Great premise...but not a great series.,"Maybe it's me. But I was hoping that this series would be a great take on the legend of King Arthur. However, I found myself bored to death most of the time, mostly due to an inexperienced cast that would be better off in ads for Abercrombie and Fitch. There's not enough respect for the source material--which does NOT need revising at all. The production values are just fine, but between the script and the terrible acting, you end up wishing Merlin would just blow everyone to bits. The series lasted one season; I know why!"
2,Too Bad . . . .,"Well, ""too bad"" sums it up, unfortunately. Too bad to enjoy, too bad to watch, too bad to buy, et cetera ad infinitum. The other reviews cover most of that. But I'd just like to add, ""Too bad the photography director wasn't also the writing team, the main director, and at least half the actors."" I really do regret that I'll miss the wonderful photography because I absolutely cannot stomach the puerile efforts of the writers, director and actors trying so hard to achieve success by reducing Camelot to two-dimensional soft porn. What a waste."
4,More adult series than Merlin,"We have watched and enjoyed the Merlin series, but when I found this we decided to give it a try. To be honest at the beginning I wasn't that wild about it, but soon we got addicted and have now watched all available episodes."
1,Camealittle,Camelot could have been amazing alas it was not. The lead Arthur is a horrible actor. The plot is slow and the action isn't enough. Don't waste your time or your money if you want to see an amazing series watch a Game of Thrones.
4,"It's not linguistics, but it's very funny.","Zakennayo is a refreshing romp through Tokyo in the disguise of a book about slang. It's delightfully politically uncorrect and pokes fun at nearly everyone, from gaijin adventurers to the gatekeepers of Japan's insular culture. A fun read for a rainy day or any day in Japan."
3,"Humourous, but not very useful","Though this book might prove to be an interesting diversion on a rainy day, it fails to serve the purpose advertised on it's cover, namely helping the reader to break from the textbook-style language patterns learned in school or through self-study. Aimed at a male audience, it portrays foreign men in Japan making pathetic one-line passes at the local women, but fails to help the reader to understand the cultural context of the various examples.The language presented herein consists mostly of obscene words rather than true slang, in any case not useful to actual communication. The abundance of errors in Japanese grammar leads one to doubt the author's knowledge of the subject discussed and of the language in general. My apologies and best wishes to the author should he choose to update and improve this book in the future, but for now, I cannot in good conscience recommend this book."
4,Good for eyelid crease,"This book is great if you are interested in creating eyelid creases in Asians without one (It should be titled ""Creating the eyelid crease in Asians during blepharoplasty""). The video is good but doesn't have seemless transitions so you miss a few seconds of some of the procedure steps. Overall worthwhile if you have many Asian patients without eyelid creases but doesn't really show standard blephs with excessive hooding that some older Asians have."
4,One of the better gay films,"I really don't hold a lot of high expectations for indies, but I was really surprised by David Searching. It was a very funny and touching film and I ended up thoroughly enjoying this movie. The performances are great, and some of the cameos are suprising. Leslie Smith, credited with both writing and directing, did a very decent job for a first film. I recommend it."
2,too much work and ugly,"Wish this was not ""assembly required"" as I was not prepared to deal with drills/tools etc. Prefer already assembled options. Plus it looks cheap and ugly. Plastic end caps keep falling off, the cats love them, I do not!!"
2,"worthy, but ...","The editor should be congratulated for making this chronicle available to the reading public, but I'm not sure who it's really aimed at. This work is a modern English translation of a Middle English translation of a French translation of a Latin work (which is itself based in turn on other chronicles), so it is unlikely to be consulted by scholars who wish to know about the events of the First Crusade. It is of more interest as a piece of late-medieval English literature, and as an example of how there was a continuing demand for crusade literature long after the Frankish occupation of the Holy Land had ended."
4,Uncle Dave is back.....& hungry!,"I have been Uncle Daves #1 fan since Women n Children ruined me forever! While his last couple of albums have been less than great,DLR IS THE RETURN OF THE MAN! VH3 [is not good](Edwards self-indulgence was always tempered by Daves over-indulgence)thus the problems w/both outfits. Dave has always stayed faithful to the legions of VH fans(shame Edward cant say the same)& this new cd sounds like vintage VH(see:fair warning). Its a shame Dave dsnt have major label support,cuz this record shoulda been huge! Give the man his due ""SLAMDUNK"" was the #1 requested song of that summer on rock radio nationwide w/out a big label(selling better than VH3). But good news,Uncle Dave & Edward have buried the hatchet & are in the studio....THE MIGHT VAN HALEN will fly again!"
1,What a waste of time!,"After reading the rave reviews both here and on Melodicrock.com, I was primed for Diamond Dave at his best. He's not. The tunes (?) here have no memorable (or even discernible) melodies, and the choruses (such as they are) fall way short. And what the hell is with that straining, elongate-every-syllable technique on ""Blacklight""? That may be Dave's worst vocals EVER. Don't get me started on the lyrics, either. While I don't expect Dave's lyrical insight to alter my worldview, these are so disjointed and nonsensical as to be ridiculous. Not one of the songs here comes within a mile of his earlier stuff. A MAJOR disappointment. This might be as bad as VH III! Gave it 1 star because the system won't let you give zero."
3,It Ain't the Worst That I've Seen...,"When I hit play for the first time after getting this album, I heard the driving ""Slam Dunk"", and thought, this might be alright. Obviously, and shamelessly, Dave is trying to recapture the sound and the fury of the old Van Halen days, and does a fair job. Some of the lyrics are pretty silly, though, even for Dave. ""Counter Blast"" is pretty dumb, being all about computers and the internet. And I doubt Dave is too adept on a basketball court (""Slam Dunk""). The guitarists obviously have worshipped at the Eddie-Alter, and the double-bass drum pulse reeks of Alex Van Halen. Loved Dave in Van Halen, but without eachother, they don't stand up so well. Sorry, Dave, but I still love ya! At least this towers above the musical abomination that is Van Halen III."
1,Cute but a mess,"This hearth rug was much more attractive than the picture and seemed to be a fair value, but it immediately started unraveling when I removed the price tag from it. Later, my cats pulled at the loose thread and it is now and unsightly mess."
5,Awesome collaboration,Love this CD. Recommend this CD to anyone and or everyone who wants to shake their money maker. You will absolutely love it.
3,Linkin Park - Cd Single,"Let me say first i love L.P. This single is great with the Video of Breaking The Habit, live version of Crawling and the song Breaking The Habit. Great 3 track cd but they could of put a live verion of breaking the habit on there(wouldnt that make sense). but overall i like it...."
4,A very fine academic mystery,"This very fine academic mystery pits two grad students against a newly-discovered letter that might throw new light on the authorship controversy -- if it's not a forgery.Smith's writing is clean, the tension between the two students is wonderful, and her portraits of the Elizabethans the students are chasing through the shadows of London work very well indeed. Smith knows what it's like to have an important discovery almost within your reach."
3,Interesting Twist...,"This book was a good read, writing flows, enjoyable. The story plot is a bit interesting. Sarah Smith gives an captivating story about the age-old question of whether Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare. As I am a Shakespeare lover I cannot agree with the suggestions in this book, but makes you think about the other side and how others think it was Oxford who wrote the Shakespearean works, etc.The romance in the book has a sad ending... romance between the Kellogg Collection catalogger, Joe, and the rich and sassy Posy. The end is a bit wishy washy, but over all a pretty good book."
2,Please Stick to Reisden and Perdita Next Time,"I couldn't wait to read this book because I loved her trilogy, particularly the Vanished Child, which was one of the best books I've ever read, and I like Shakespeare. BUT, this book was really quite poor. I had trouble even following the arguments/plot, and the lead female character was, ""like so annoying."" This was akin to Patricia Cornwell's ridiculous attempt to write about Jack the Ripper. Smith, like Cornwell, needs to stick to what she does best, which appears to be psychological mystery like the Reisden/Perdita series."
1,Not the right book if Robert is your parliamentary authority,"This is a reprint of one of the earlier editions of Robert's Rules which has been superseded by the current edition. While fine for historical research, if you are in need of the correct parliamentary authority for use in your organization, you should obtain the current (11th) edition of Robert's Rules."
4,Robert's rules of Order,A must have for meetings in any organization. Provides just and fair rules which allow smoother transitions of large organizational meetings.
3,COMFY,"THE HOUSE SHOES CAME ON TIME. I'M IN A WHEELCHAIR AND THE HOUSE SHOES I HAD BEFORE DIDN'T HAVE A REAL SOLID BOTTOM AND AFTER A WHILE, THE FOOT PLATFORM WOULD HURT MY FEET. THESE HOUSE SHOES HAVE A SOLID BOTTOM AND WHEN I WEAR THEM FOR A FEW HOURS, IT DOESN'T HURT MY FEET. THEY KEEP MY FEET WARM AND THEY'RE VERY COMFORTABLE. THEY LOOK NICE TOO."
4,Comfortable Slippers,"Like everyone else said, these are snug slippers. I'm a size eight and bought a size eight. At first they were just a little too tight, but now I've stretched them a little bit and they're fine. If I did it again, I'd order an 8.5 slipper.They are very comfortable, and you can wear them outdoors as they have a solid bottom."
4,Great slipper,"I was looking for a slipper that would be for indoor use only (keep my feet warm, but be comfortable) and these were the wrong choice. These are great slippers, but they are the kind you could run out and get the mail in or drag the garbage can to the curb in since they have a thicker rubber sole. A good slipper, I just made the wrong choice for my needs."
3,Good for the price,"Pretty good slippers, and the outdoor sole works very well. You can definitely get away with occasionally wearing these outside in the snow to get your morning paper. The lining is a synthetic material, so you should realize that daily wearing with no socks will lead to bacteria growth and odors. My next pair of slippers is definitely going to be a real lambskin slipper with real wool inside, as real wool naturally fights bacteria and odors."
3,Great for Cutting Large Shapes- Not for detail work.,"I purchased the Ultra ShapeXpress Starter Kit in hopes that I would be able to cut small detailed designs for my scrapbooking projects. This item is great for cutting large shapes with use of the provided stencils and also does pretty well to freehand large shapes. If you are looking to create detail work, I would recommend using a regular exacto knife. The ShapeXpress in this kit makes it difficult to cut small details without ripping/tearing the paper."
4,good knife but.....,In the past my dive knives have been in a rubber sheath w/ a rubber grip.This one is plastic.Not very happy w/that.I went back to reread the description to see if I missed it at ordering time and I still didn't see it.Would prefer a rubber sheath as this one when wet can be a little slippery.
2,Not enough Meat on this Bone!,"I was expecting a book that would cover Ultradev Extensions a little better, only 26 of the 218 pages covered Ultradev extensions the rest was dedicated to dreamweaver. The book really only covers the basics and does not dive too deep, if you have a lot of hand coded routines that you want to make into extensions, this is not the book for it. Perhaps I as a programmer was expecting more of a developers book as opposed to a Web Page book. However on a positive note, the book is fun to read and contains good examples."
3,Catherine the Great,"Catherine the Great, written by Katherine Scherman, is a very interesting book about the life of Catherine and the accomplishments she had with the people of Russia and the country's affairs. I like this book because it goes into great detail about the historical events that happened during Catherine's rule and the ways she helped the Russian people. It also goes into the personal life of Catherine, such as her love life and her family life. After I read this book, I was impressed with Catherine because she did so much with her country and did it with a great attitude all during her rule. I would recommend this book to whomever likes learning about history and the people who made history."
5,Best one in the market...,"+++++ quality product. You may find lots of Turkish Delight kind in the market. Differnt prices and qualities. Why would'nt you go wuth the best and traditional one. The brand ""Haci Bekir"" is the most trusted in Turkey the home country."
1,Waste of time and money,"I got this book hoping for insight as to what made this legendary woman so fascinating. What I received was a book which repeated the same thing over and over (I get it, Jackie's dad was a womanizer who was known as Black Jack, and her mom was critical, can we move on now please?), written at what I can only assume is a (...)reading level, by a woman who did not know Jackie, but is attempting to profit from the fact that they once lived in the same building. The one star is for some nice pictures, but if that is what you are interested in, then I would suggest that you buy a picture book. It would be a much better use of your money."
2,Waste of Money,Very little helpful information on lighting in this book. Tries to cover too broad a range for photographic lighting.
1,Emeril's Italian Essence??,"I hope this stuff is really great when added to Italian meals. I ordered two bottles because I expected the best from Emeril, live and learn. I opened one bottle and removed the seal to smell the ""essence"". Wow, to my surprise not only was the bottle less than half full, but the contents are powder, no body to the ingredients what so ever!! This stuff is not cheap and from now on I will buy items like this in my local stores, that way I can take it back if it is like this stuff. BAM, my butt. This will also make me very wary of any other Emeril stuff."
2,No Aloe,"I cannot see any Aloe in this product. Best one so far is a wierd prodcut called ""Good On Ya"" which helps get rid of the age 82 black coloring on the backs of my hands, but it is $60 (I got two at a carnival for price of one) I tried the Gold Bond but made color worse!!"
5,Holy Smooth Skin!!!,"This lotion is a cure all for the winter!!! So far, my frequently washed hands, dry ashy body, loose skin (from losing weight) and winter dermatitis is a thing of the past! My husband uses it on it cut and chaffed hands as he is a mechanic, and loves how it is NOT greasy!!! It stays on even after washing several times. Unlike other products, Gold Bond does NOT burn your already sore body! INTENSELY RECOMMENDED!!! This price is Amazing on Amazon, and the automatic ship is a Must for when you fall in love with your skin again!!!"
3,It's small!,"Good frame, good quality but just need more of it. Although the dimensions are clearly stated, our fault, we expected for it to be bigger based on the images. Oh well, it's still a nice frame."
4,EXCELLENT!,"Every woman I know, of every age, falls in love with this kid's voice. My daughter has been a fan since his first appearance on Allie McBeal, so I gave her the dvd for Chirstmas and she was THRILLED. Josh is amazing, as always, though I agree with the other reviewers: Angie Stone was not a good match and Lili Hayden was delightful. I found the video graphics a little distracting--rose petals, swirls, flashes of light; it was much nicer when the screens were used to create a ""place"" background, as they did on ""Let Me Fall"". All things considered, a very enjoyable evening and a dvd well worth having."
4,Josh Grovan in Concert,"I liked the professional attire on Josh Grovan during the concert and I liked the entire tape dedicated to him and not having ""fillers"" inbetween except two ladies, both of which were good.Concert in L.A. Outside Ampitheater(Griffith Park up on the hill)(where I used to live) was too casual.I heard from my friend in Cary that the Concert in Rauleigh was terrible...too many and too long ""fillers"" up front - ; much too loud altogether including that of Josh...left @the first song of Josh ended."
3,Josh Groban in Concert,"Agreed wholeheartedly with review of person from Denver, CO. The choice of Angie Stone (not Charlotte Church) was not a good one and the absence of ""O Holy Night"" was especially disappointing for me because I did purchase the DVD/CD in December and was looking forward to seeing as well as hearing this beautiful duet. However, I've read Charlotte Church is seeking other areas (i.e. Madonna- and Brittney Spears-like videos?)of expressing her talents. If that is so, she herself may have refused to appear on this fine DVD in hopes of changing her ""sweet, innocent"" image. Poor young girl, I fear she may be being misled by greedy people around her! DVD Viewer and Josh Groban fan in Beacon Falls, CT"
3,Josh Groban In Concert,"It was very disappointing that no libretto with the words to the songs came with the cd. The music was great, but without the words, much was missing. I don't recommend this cd."
3,old and short,"more of a big pamphlet. When you read it you will say, ""oh, this is what gardeners read in the 50's. That is nice""."
3,I wanted to love this book....,you know when you psych yourself out to really love a book and find parts that work only to be really disappointed by the rest? that's this book. a lot that feels forced along with some very entertaining bits.
2,Anourag - disappointing,"Everything about this CD (tacky cover to the music) is aimed at commercialism! Much like her first CD titled ""Anoushka"", this new recording by Anoushka is completely lacking in musical substance. It is quite apparent that this is music performed by rote and this is the main reason that there are six ragas (again!) in sixty minutes! Most concert goers in India are aware of the aesthetic aspects of performing a raga and the artist is judged by this ability of finer sense! Ravi Shankar deserves all the credit for his compositions based on various ragas but unfortunately even these pieces are wrongly (or deliberately?) noted as ""songs"" in the text notes. The unusual and curious two tabla format serves an entertainment value and is definitely needed as a diversion from other inadequacies of the performance!"
1,Anourag dull fare!!,This CD offers an amateurish rendition of important ragas! The visual aspect of the Cd is also tasteless!
5,simon rattle-jazz,"rattle has had a career as a conductor of classical music with the city of birmingham orchestra. this is an excellent jazz album featuring ellington,s music with lena horne among others.highly recommended as is the earlier ""jazz album"""
1,"This is gift wrap paper, NOT AS BOOK!!!","No where in the description does this tell you this is not a book, but a package of gift wrap paper in a quilt pattern. Only if you have superman eyesight can you read the 5th line in the title and see that it says gift wrap!"
5,not flawless but spicy!,"a very honest-to-core depiction of indian beurocracy and poignant yet funny struggle of daily lives. second half may appear a little slapstick, but no other option could have been done justice to the movie. wonderful performances by the lead cast - authentic anupam, hilarious bomman, and biting ranvir!"
1,ugly thermo textbook,This book does not explain in coherent manner. Topics are not organized. Avoid this book for beginner.
3,For the small-headed children!,"This helmet is just what you should expect for the price. It's a thinner plastic than you might hope for, though, and it definitely is for SMALLER children. I would say it's a fit for kids under 8, and if your child has either a larger head or a lot of hair it might not even fit an 8-year-old. Overall fine all things considered, but look elsewhere if you are outfitting a larger ""army"" fan!"
4,Braunbeck Goes to the Dogs,"Gary Braunbeck is a master crafstman of the dark. His short fiction is regularly at the top of my fav orites list, and I was a major fan of his first novel IN SILENT GRAVES. KEEPERS is another very good piece of dark fantasy fiction mapping the traumas and terrors of the past to show where the potential for the human spirit might lay. Rarely is an author capable of writing such emotionally powerful work that rises above the boundaries of genre and manages to illuminate the grace of the human soul...especially when categorized as ""horror."" My only quibble with the book is a somewhat distracting middle ""flashback"" section (which is a good read on its own but seems oddly out of place, slowing the forward momentum of the tale), and a muddled ending that doesn't quite meet the potential of the story. Still, a terrific read, and I very much look forward to Braunbeck's next novel."
5,A Great Novel,"I read this novel in a few days. It is strange, and what I call smart horror because it makes you think and takes the genre in directions I never considered. I thought the opening was scary as hell."
2,Didn't Like it,"I got about 150 pages into this book and still am not sure what is really going on. I get that the Keepers are coming but it felt as though the narrator was rambling. I had major trouble staying interested in this book, so much so I could not finish it. I don't recommend it."
3,Different...,"This was a pretty strange book... I did like the narrative style a lot. The writer's voice was quite unique, but, unfortunately the general storyline itself didn't make a whole lot of sense. I expected more of an explanation for the strange occurrences. Plus, it would've been nice if there were more things about the animals since that aspect of the premise was what originally drew me to this book. It was a fast read though, and while it wasn't a great book, it wasn't an all bad one, either. I have another book of his on my to-read list, but I am not in any great rush to read it, though I think I still will - just not right away."
2,Keepers,"Did not like the book, couldn't bring myself to finish it. I like Braunbeck, loved his book ""Mr Hands"" but this book was just not my thing I guess. The writing was good and there were some parts that touched me, just didn't like it overall."
1,Cheap - buy Nikon cord instead,"This sync cord came in a kit with an SB-600 and Stroboframe bracket. It worked for about an hour, them the cord started to separate at the end where it was attached to the flash shoe and the function became erratic. Pay the extra $20 and get the Nikno SC-28 sync cord."
4,It works like it should,"Works like any barndoor should with only one problem that I can see. That problem is putting a gel in the gel holder. You have to flex the barndoor or bow the gel I little to get it to slide into the holder. If the barndoor would open just a little wider this would not be a issue. However its not that big of a deal, and I will buy another one if I need it."
4,Good earrings,"These earrings are definitely a bit ""cheap"" in terms of manufacturing and materials. One of the stalks had a kink in it. But, you can't see that when you're wearing the earrings, and the price was right."
5,Surprisingly good & interesting,"I didn't realize it was a 6th grade reader, and I've been reading the stories to my 1st grader before bed (we are halfway through). He loves the stories! I think all grades would be interested in them, older & younger. Very well told. I was really impressed with with the stories ""Joseph & His Brothers"" and ""The Second Mile"", because I learned something new in them. I finally, really ""got"" why Joseph sent the bags of money back with his brothers. I ""got"" the in-depth look into the test, that has been missing in other Bible stories. And in The Second Mile, I now understand what this really meant when Jesus told people to go the second mile. Very, very well done! There are 9 Units to the book. Only Unit 3 is Bible stories."
1,Disappointed/too tight for a standard violin. Had to return it since we can't use it.,You can not fit a violin inside as it is too tight and could damage the instrument. We were so disappointed because we thought it would be so useful.
5,"Down with ""Kitty"" and ""Ricky""!","I am in accord with most of the previous reviewers in that I also feel that ""Kitty Magennis"" and ""Christmas Time's a' Comin'""are the ""wild cards"" popping out of the pack and do NOT belong on this CD! I greatly enjoy Maire Breatnach's ""Derdriu,"" which is almost Appalachian-sounding in my opinion. My favorite cut is the poignant ""December Rain"" by Brian Dunning and Jeff Johnson."
3,I'm Stuck!,"I have never finished a horse game before and this is no esception, its a great game but I can't get past chasing Blacklock. I REALLY need some help, Please? and whats the whole thing about some kinda romance?"
3,"Really fun game, STUPID romance","This was an absolutely AWESOME game. OK, so you arrive at your very own brand new stud farm. You have one horse, and the place is a wreck. So you renovate the estate until everything is in lovely peace and order, and you earn more horses as you compete. Davy is the ""cute"" stableboy who lives there with his kid sister, Rose, and some sort of ""romance"" unravels between Estelle (your character) and the Davy fellow. It's all mushy and gross and awful. Overall, it's a good game if you can bear the grossest, mushiest romance ever."
3,a little disappointing,"After reading the other reviews of this book I was expecting something more, more creative designs, fresher designs . . . just something more. After thumbing through the book I didn't really find anything I was super-excited to get started on. I have another of Kooler's books (555 Patterns for the Young at Heart) which has some adorable designs so I was expecting something more along those lines. This book has some nice designs, though nothing struck me as being really fresh, new or inovative. I would look into some of her other books before purchasing this one, or check out 2001 Cross-Stitch Designs: the Essential Reference (Better Homes and Gardens) for a great book with a huge variety of motifs that can easily be stitched on a weekend project."
5,Profound Parenting,"While, as a youth, I often panned Mister Rogers, as an adult, I find him inspiring. This book is filled with simple, practical information that can have a profound effect on the way you parent your children and the way you parent yourself."
4,First book I'll give my daughter when colleges approaches,"Chris Ferretti has captured the attention of the parents that have read his book. While attending college I experienced many things similiar to the items in this book but never would I think to write it down and never to share it with my daughter. Eloquently and precisely Ferretti has ""shown the way"" for the many college students that will read this book. He has proven that there is both and upside and a downside to almost all topics. He gives the basics it takes to be involved and enjoy college and very importantly talks about he hearts that are in a fraternity, something not everyone gets to see. I can't wait to walk my daugter into college and let her ""live"" the way Ferretti has...all the while having the cliff notes to a successful college life.."
3,"Fine writing, but fatally flawed maps","Robert K. Krick, a well known authority on the Army of Northern Virginia, has written a fine account of the culmination of the 1862 Valley Campaign at the Battle of Port Republic. Unfortunately, the maps, which are always an indispensible adjunct to military writing, are a shambles. Thanks, evidently, to an oversight by the publisher, about half of the numerous maps lack the textual labels to identify the various units. Thus, the reader is left to guess at just what the maps are depicting. A work that is otherwise as meritorious as this deserves far, far better care by the publisher than this one received."
1,Trojan Horse of a book,"Like everyone else, I thought the blurbs were compelling enough to buy this book. I found it interesting from the point that here's a man who says what he really thinks. I read with avid interest and found myself agreeing to a point on many issues he raised. Mr. Elders is catagorical, if nothing else in his opinions. No shades of gray here. Then somewhere in the book, I found this to be a rather fanatical tyrade, rather than a reasoned, balanced expression of his views. His solution to the gun problem in America of advocating more guns in the hands of the population just baffles me. Just when you have a picture of this author as reasonable, the tone veers towards the extreme. For anyone interested in this book, I urge a critical mind. He has many valuable things to say, but hidden among these ideas are some potentially dangerous ones."
1,Elder the biggest hypocrite around???,"I read Mal from So Cals review here, checked it out, and sure enough, this Larry Elder guy is a hypocrite. He used affirmative action to get his college education, but now opposes it for anyone else. He denounces those who use the call of racism, but was mysteriously silent when his supporters used it to protest his cut hours on an LA radio station.The book is nothing but Right Wing Political correctness."
5,"finally, somebody who makes sense",I checked this book out from the library and enjoyed it so much that I went out and purchased it just so that I could pass it around to my friends. Mr. Elder tackles the subjects that we tend to shy away from in polite conversation so as not to offend. He presents the Libertarian point of view which argues that the least government is the best government. He abhors the culture of victimization and entitlement which weakens us all. I found his viewpoints well argued (even those that I did not agree with fully). I highly recommend this thought provoking book.
5,Finally a black role model for all Americans,"I have a very hard time pointing out black males I'd be proud to call my personal role model. Larry Elder almost makes up for the Jesse Jackson/Al Sharpton types with his common sense thoughts and arguments. This book fits right in with what I believe and exposes much of the mumbo jumbo ""whine until you win"" style tactics practiced by the left in America today."
2,The Ten Things You Can't Say In America,"Larry Elder position on several issues (e.g. Blacks are more racist than whites, Women are paid equally than men) shows that Larry doesn't understand ""what's going on in America"". Anyone can find opposing ""facts"" but the majority of evidence and the reason(s) are major factors that cannot be ignored. This is the felicity that Larry presents his information. Larry Elder's character, it seems, is clearly ""middle-man"" between the white-male and the rest of society."
4,Author's Manifesto,"I did enjoy this book. Mr. Chenoweth appears to have a deep passion for what he sees as inequities and injustices in theoperation of our government. He has devoted a great deal of time to studying these problems, and to developing practical remedies thereto. I believe this book is the culmination of that process. It is a work of fiction, but it is, in some ways, a political manifesto. This book is his argument for change, with detailed prescriptions to effect that change. I don't necessarily agree with all of his prescriptions for change, but that is not the point. What is the point is that this book is a good read and a call for action. If you enjoy political thrillers and are not averse to having your thinking challenged, then this is the book for you."
3,Bulbs from China,"What can I say. Its a 60 watt bulb. The brightness is comparable now I just need to see how long they last. One thing of note they were poorly packaged. One bulb in the box of 24 was shattered, sharp glass everywhere. I think they made it over on the boat just fine. It was the USA warehouse packing and shipping that did it in."
1,broken bulbs from china,"2/3 of the bulbs were broken in transit. The glass in the bulbs is very thin, resulting in very thin shards of glass, which cling to the intact bulbs and their boxes and fly everywhere. Shards which are tracked everywhere by children and pets. Probably going to throw the surviving bulbs away just to be on the safe side. The one star is for the price being low enough that I don't feel compelled to go through the trouble of returning the product."
5,Exactly what I wanted!,"I was looking for front-mounted video connections for a drive bay, and this one can't be beat for the money! You could also use the rear PCI connector only, or use the drive bay setup as an external box. I like variety! The software is ULead Video Studio, which is ok for basic home movies. You get all the wiring connectors you could possibly need.Oh, and as happy as I am with this so far -- I haven't even hooked it up as a t.v. yet! I've been busy making home video DVDs."
3,Great stretch out routine.,"I am into stretching and increasing blood flow. This product is so good. Very standard. Easy to use, really no instuctions needed. I wouldn't use it on a flimsy door frame to work the routine. I use my feet (with shoes to spread out the pressure point) to stretch the cable. Just place you foot in the nylon hoop at the middle of the cable and stretch back yours arms. You can hang it on the back of a door hook for storage and it is there ready to use quickly. Easy to carry on trips, packs small and in one piece. Heavy resistance, so you can push yourself into a good burn. You can get several muscle stretch just by reviewing the instruction booklet included with the cables. Quick exercise."
3,cliff notes,"I bought this by mistake, not understanding it was cliff notes style. I ended up really liking the more detailed discription of characters. Someone elses thoughts on the books."
5,To all lovers of Irish history,"A vey interesting book about the rebellions in 1798 . A must for history students and all young Irish people. I have been to Vinegar Hill in Enniscorthy and will visit ""The Wild West"" next time next time I go to Ireland"
5,Inspiring Miracles,"My husband and I are reading this faith-inspiring book for the second time. It is a well-written, documented compilation of modern-day miracles which affirm that God is in control."
3,"Though it dragged in spots, this was a good book!","I enjoyed how Deanna and Patterson started out wary of one another then, little by little, they broke down the stero-types and began to appreciate each other and see how much the had in common. There romance built into this beautiful love. I could feel it grow for not just each other but also for Jade - who was adorable. The ending was kind of quick, throwing in the ""Nancy"" thing seemed a bit much and I don't understand why the writer made being a fireman sound as if it's scrapping the bottom of the barrel and something to be ashamed of but otherwise, it was a good book."
4,...great storytelling...!,"This was my first Sandra Kitt romance and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Her writing flowed with the smoothness of an experienced story teller with no bothersome errors or strange plot twists. The 2 main characters, Deanna and Patterson are mature, introspective individuals and the journey through their relationship as it grows from friendship to love is great reading. The child's dialogue (Jade) was well written and believable as well. I will definitely be reading more of Ms. Kitt's work.-ES"
1,Sorry I opened the package!,"Couldn't play it on my 4 y.o. Gateway, wish I knew it wouldn't work before I opened it. It wouldn't even start. What a waste!"
1,uNREAL 3,"not impressed lags and overall I am selling it. Really sucks....Well, here I go.Camera, glitchy and to spot on.Animation, slow at times and uneven.Graphics, Good art but some of the blood and effects aren't.Gameplay, LOADS of stuff to do, but it gets boring after the first few deathmatches.Action, slow for a shooter,"
1,"Nice features, but horrible single player campaign","I liked the game for it's aesthetics and maps considering it is my first Unreal. However, what is unreal is the single player campaign. You are pretty much on your own against sophisticated enemy AI (which behaves as if all of them were fitted with x-ray glasses considering it always knows where you are), while your team has the intelligence of 5 year olds. If you're looking for just a smooth single player campaign and you're not an expert at FPS games, you will end up very frustrated and disappointed with this game."
5,great game,Great game for Online competition. Hours of enjoyment. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys fast passed shooter games against real opponents.
1,even Epic is embarassed,"This game is horrible, especially for PC. They've even said they are going to concentrate on console gaming since the PC gaming world is in disarray. This was their excuse for putting out an unfinished product. Don't expect any Linux Server that works cause you won't find it. The graphics look like the artists ate a whole bunch of red and brown food and barfed on the monitor. Truly a disappointment after all the waiting, will stick with UT2004 which is now like $9.99? and still a MASTERPIECE.I guess if it ain't broke don't fix it and it REALLY applies in this case.I wasted my money, want my copy??"
1,Sad!,"Just didn't live up to my expectations. They left to much for the mod community to finish off, especially to have 3 years to work on it."
4,Extreme!!,"This game is fantastic! Graphics are amazing and gameplay is great! There is actually a developed storyline in this game unlike the previous unreal tournament games.My only complaints about this game is that when you're fighting along side with an AI character and they say something over the radio, they don't open their mouths and speak.But overall, amazing game! Plays great on PC, even better if your PC has a PhysX card! You get realistic ragdolls, loinclothes over armor moves realisticly as character moves, same with realistic movement of the flags in capture the flag (flag waves back and forth as the player runs carrying the flag with him/her)Also, Ageia released special physics mods for UT3 players with PhysX cards. Mods include special levels with destructable environments (need a door? Shoot the wall and walk through!) and friggin tornadoes!!!Overall, great game! Amazingly fun, especially on multiplayer with your friends!"
3,"Well-made, great fun, no one seems to play it.","PROS: Great gameplay, awesome new vehicles compared to the prev. gen of UT.CONS: No one plays it.FINAL VERDICT: Don't buy unless its less than $15. All you'll get is the single-player.SUMMARY: Bought this game about a year ago, and gave up on it around then. The real key behind any of the UT series is multiplayer. For whatever reason, no one, and I mean no one seems to play this game. I played through the entire single player campaign and it was great, mind-thrashing fun. Then I fired up the multiplayer. I found tons of servers, but to my dismay, seemingly no players. Don't get me wrong, the servers were all partly full. Of bots. What a disappointment."
5,killing spree,i love it. put down boaring halo can come play a real mans game. and make sure you bring the monster to stay wired!!!!
2,"""Low"" isn't","I've had this for approx 4 years and haven't used it as much as I'd hoped. It just doesn't cook right. The Low setting is way too hot. My most recent try to make this work was last week. Frozen chicken, a big block of frozen stock, turned it to Low and left for work. Got home 9 1/2 hours later & everything was overcooked, as in the past. The chicken meat was dry & stringy, even though it was submerged in the now bubbling broth. This cooker is even too hot to make homemade stock; the finished stock is bitter & actually tastes a little burnt.The warm setting doesn't get hot enough to cook with so that's not a solution.The High setting is like cooking with nuclear reactor.This unit is pretty big at 6 quarts. Great for making a batch of stock but certainly too big for dinner for two people."
1,Bad Crock,"I have a thirty year old Rival Crock Pot that still has not one crack in it. Therefore, I was shocked when I used this large beautiful piece of cookware for the first time and it cracked. Multiple cracks after the very first use. It wasn't an expensive purchase but a very disappointing one. Was it bad luck... I have no clue. I'd love for Rival to exchange my cracked crock for a new one so I could find out and I'd be happy to say, it was just bad luck."
2,"""Low"" setting = burn city","I purchased this slow cooker on my mother's advice, since she's been using this model for years. In terms of price, capacity, and ease of use, it's great. However, the heat settings seem to be way, way too high. Did you know that a slow cooker is capable of burning food into oblivion? I sure didn't.As it is now, I can only use this cooker on the weekends when I'm home to watch it, because recipes that are supposed to take 8-12 hours to cook are generally done in 3 or 4. I bought it for the purpose of coming home to cooked meals after work, but anything left unattended in this cooker for more than seven or eight hours will completely scald.It cooks adequately if you have the time to watch it carefully, but for my purposes, it's worthless. I'll be purchasing a better model."
3,Better than Bertrem's Guide to the Age of Mortals,"This book explored the War of Souls era, through the everyday peoples eyes. The front cover tells that it is the first volume of a series. That is of course not right. In fact there also were Bertrem's Guide to the Age of Mortals(which was terrible boring, to say the least), but this is much better.What i think makes it better is that the book consists of journals written by different knights, or Qualinesti rebels, among other things, and in writing journals it makes the book much more interesting than Bertrem's Guide to the Age of Mortals.It isn't a masterpiece. Some of the stories are very good, and some are still a little boring. John Grubber's part of the book was, after my opinion the most boring, while Jeff Crook's journal of a Qualinesti rebel was very well written and exciting.It isn't one of the best Dragonlance books, but it is not bad, it is absolutely worth reading, if you love the War of Souls era."
2,Image does not reflect the product containt.,"The set have two lines of blue and two lines of green. Blue chips = $10, green chips = $25. Not as expected."
4,Rich Diamonds,"This collection is culled from three albums during her A&M career from 72-75, two studio, and one live album, and really does capture Joan at a richly creative period in her glittering career. The highlights here are many and various, and I shan't repeat my fellow reviewers listings, only confirm that this is a luscious collection of some classic songs, with the 'Diamonds & Rust' album strongly represented. The sound quality has a real warmth to underpin her glorious register, while the backing is clear throughout, even in the live set. My only niggle is that her epic 'Winds of the Old Days' from the Diamonds & Rust album has been forgotten: this self-penned piece has some of her strongest lyrics and lovely melody, so it's astonishing that it's displaced by some other covers, which are less essential. Nevertheless, this is a real bargain at the price, and feels like stepping into a warm, honey-scented bath. Sink into it, and enjoy."
2,Made me think my system was damaged!,"This DVD Recorder was an acceptable product if taken as a DVD recorder - the functions worked acceptably, if not good, the picture was decent and generally everything was not bad.What REALLY was awful was it had a ground-feedback loop. The ground was fed too much power. This carried to the TV which was on the same surge protector. It made the screen fuzzy and made me think my TV was broken for longest time. When removed to be replaced by an upscaling model, the problem was removed. Tried with another Television, the same issue.I would not buy another DVD player from Liteon. I like their drives and components, but I will never buy another thing from them that plugs into the wall!"
5,Standing Next to History,Well written and most informative. This is so descriptive that I almost feel like I am right there. Highly recommend.
4,"Very good, but Dan Emmett's book is THE best","Former Secret Service Agent Dan Emmett's book ""Within Arm's Length"" is THE best book on the Secret Service ever written. However, former agent Joe Petro can hold his head up high on the basis of his fine book---no gossip, no security secrets; well done, indeed. In fact, get BOTH books asap"
3,Great Collection - Bad Packaging,"This collection of DVD's is an awesome collection. It is unbelievably detailed in many of the documentaries that are included along with the 6 or so full length movies. My issue is this: While I understand that packaging 36 DVD's is difficult, storing them in a oddly shaped tin box in DVD sleeves is highly inconvienent and practically non-practical on many shelves. If it wasn't for the packaging, this product easily would have rated 5 stars."
3,Whoever made this did NOT play settlers,"My college chums and I play about 2 to 3 games of Settlers a day. We play one on one, we play with the six player expansion, we play instead of going to class. So naturally when we spent two weeks in china we had to find some way to bring settlers with us. Here's the problem with this travel version: it changes the game. Whoever made this edition obviously was not a settlers player himself. The desert is pderminantly fixed in the middle? Perminant? The middle? Thats right, sports fans, every game must be played on a donout version of Catan. I modified my set with a sharpie and some cardboard, but be warned that if you want to play real settlers you will need to do this two. Travel editions shouldnt simplify the game."
4,Gift,Brother enjoyed playing with his son. Perfect for the two of them as is travel size to take on trips.
4,Decent boots,"They're very well-made. They don't have much arch support, so I did have to add inserts. Otherwise, I'm really glad to have purchased these."
1,Life is hard!,"Trust me....life is hard! Dont make it harder by buying this book. Blackjack is a very difficult game to win money from. This book will simply lose you money. If you really really want to try to win money at the casino, try Poker. If you must try Blackjack get a proper book like Bryce Carlson; Lance Humble; Wong etcI gave this book one star a) Because I am a very generous person b) Because at least the book was mercifully short & c) Because Amazon made me!"
4,Generally happy with this phone...,"I wasn't looking for anything fancy- good phone, bluetooth compatible, still need to get a good headset that works with this phone.Positives:- Overall: Generally happy, last phone wasn't flip- but once I got used to the flip, its fine.- Sound: quality is good- User interface: is generally intuitive- Customizability- FUN! Rings, faceplace colors- can be changed, etc- Battery: Its OK- I charge it every night, seems to be fine so farNegatives:- PTT: button is easy to push, and I push it all the time, so that can get annoying- but I don't mind it too much- Speakerphone: Ok, not the best, but ok, also, wish I could close the phone and still be on speaker, unless I've missed somethingOverall, I'm happy, had it for a couple weeks, not issues, battery life is alright, sound is ok, easy to use, comfortable. I'm glad I have it."
2,Turns off & bad placement for PTT button,"Got this phone for my husband and boy do I wish we'd picked another. He wears his phone on his belt and just the act of sitting down pushes the PTT button. I wish there were at least a way to disable it!He also has problems with it turning off. Over 50% of the time when he opens the phone up or just looks at the outer screen, it has turned itself off. Which means missed text messages, missed calls, and just a general pain in the rear.We'll head over to cingular this weekend to see about switching it out. Otherwise this is a useless piece of junk."
3,Had phone for over 1 1/2 years,"When we got our service plan we got two of these phones. For the most part they worked just fine. The battery life is a bit low but we never did a lot of talking on it so we could always charge it over night. One of the phones just started not charging a few months ago so we had to get something different. I've always used a protective case on mine so the screen has not been touched and it looks good even after so much time and going everywhere. I do not like the PTT button like many other users, but since it isn't activated it doesn't really bother me. My favorite part of this phone is the alarm, it is really easy to set, and will go off until you turn it off, which is great for forcing me out of bed in the morning. When our contract is up, we will probably switch to something completely different, but it has been a good reliable phone for the most part."
3,Great Phone Horrible PTT Button,"All features of this phone excellent but need to be able to disable the PTT button. Each time I reach into the place in my purse or pocket to retrieve the phone when it is ringing, my finger grip includes the PTT button. It sends a busy signal to the person calling me then I have to re-dial them. I have asked about 5 different Cingular/AT&T employees at different locations to see if it can be disabled. Most just want to sell me a new phone. Two said they had disabled it, but not true. Have changed where I keep the phone and how I reach for it but haven't eliminated the problem. Otherwise, it is my favorite style phone."
1,Terrible call quality,"This phone has a lot of cutting edge features, but the call quality has been sacrificed. Even at maximum volume, I can barely hear and understand the person talking to me. Also, if you hold this phone like a regular phone, the bars go down to barely there because of the placement of the internal antennae. The PTT button is placed so that it gets accidentally hit all the time. I really miss my solid 5-yr-old Ericsson phone."
4,"great phone, like it very much","having sony z525a for over a week, here is my feedback !1. sound quality is great on both end (incoming and receiving!)2. haven't have signal issue by far (by cingular service)3. work with motorola h500 BT headset, I saw many other reviews complain voice dail not working using BT headset with sony cell phone, I can receive call, make call and voice dail using h500 no problem !4. No screen freeze or other issues !5. PTT button not a concern, since I have this phone for prepaid plan and not a heavy cell phone user !Love it both style and quality on this phone !"
4,Better than I expected,"I'm not a fan of the title ""High Lane"". It really doesn't reflect the film, which is better than your average cliched ""young people go off in nature and bad things happen"". It makes me think of ""highway"" and this film is mountains.It's a nicely paced tense action-horror-thriller. The five main characters did well with their standard roles that they had. Some of it is surprisingly bloody and gory, and the ending, while somewhat expected, had a nice irony to it.It is very similar to ""The Descent"", as another reviewer pointed out, which is one of my favorite films. ""High Lane"" is worth your time, I've seen way worse. Good effort."
2,Not a lot different or inspiring here...,"Not having read the author's other 2 books, I came across only this one and purchased it with high expectation (based upon the general reviews for the other books). Well, I;m disappointed. This is in a semi-poetic form, and it reads just like many other similar books I have come across, usually from some unknown author in the spiritual section in a used bookstore. Nothing really inspiring here. The author has a section on some 'sacred geometry' that was revealed to him during his 'fifth awakening in New York City' in 1990; I found it simplistic and rather dull. Actually, that's how I would describe this whole book. However this particular book was written, I don't doubt the author's sincerity and wish to communicate his spiritual experience. I haven't given up on him entirely, though, I will still look for his first two books and see if they have anything to offer and give them a chance if they do. I just can't recommend this particular book."
1,The Insider's Guide to Buying Home Furnishings,The Causey Book is outdated. The information included is available online in a more professional format. A good internet browser will get you more information than this book.
2,Old information,"This is a good book idea, and it might have been a good book in its day, but it's an old book with dated information, I discovered."
4,all about the bones,This book is a great learning tool in teaching about the bones and muscles great pics and quizzes to help reinforce what is learned.
3,Not my favorite...,"This series is auesome. This addition...was not my favorite. It has a good storyline, but at the end everything changes. It turns out that his father was really NOT a assasin, just another spy. I think that it has a VERY shaky storyline. I am sure horowitz could have done better."
5,Scorpia,Its a good book with a lot of action in it . it is the best book i have ever read! I'm confused at the very end of it though!!
5,Simply Elegant,"As I gazed through this book, my mind just kept seeing a variety of projects that each of the patterns could be used for. The instructions are very exact and detailed. Each pattern is just what I needed for ....project. The photos are very clear and the color palette is pleasing. This is a book that I will be adding to my collection."
5,A Greendale Fan from Ohio,The Second Edition of Greendale is great. Greendale is an album that just keeps growing and the more I listen to it or watch this wonderful new DVD the more impressed I am. Seeing Greendale last summer before the album was even released was an experience that I'm glad I had. We are going to see Neil Young and Crazy Horse perform Greendale one more time in Cleveland. What an impact this whole concept album has been. In a time when confusion and frustration is running rampant in our society it helps put things in a proper perspective for me. Now I have another copy of Greendale to leave in the car and another DVD that is truly amazing to me.Thank You Neil Young!!!
2,Now Neil's Into Greed Himself,"This 2nd Edition of Greendale is only for those who were not bored to tears (...don't cry no...) with this over-rated piece of scrappy thematic work the first time around last summer. Neil, I love you but you're at the losing end on this one. Round and round and round we go again with an effort that is listless, tempo monotonous and without a creative melody or guitar line throughout. It's like a run-on sentence that we were told to avoid in grammar school. Neil should find Stephen Stills again so they can kick some creative sense into each other. By the way, doesn't Crazy Horse sound bored, tired, sloppy and so low-tech that it's nauseating? Oh, I forgot, this was Neil's intent......again. And, the loner looks forward to your hard-earned $15.00......again. Please enjoy!"

3,"Almost, but not quite.","Riding on the vapor trail of his association with Joseph Campbell, Phil Cousineau has written anther book that is lifeless and wholly academic. Everything that he covers in the book is valid and valuable, but he name drops so much that I can't even get a feel for who he is as a person, as a researcher or as a mythologist. Is he trying to dazzle the reader with his arcane references, or is he really trying to get us to examine the mythic concepts that he presents? There is no doubt that he is a bright man. A very bright man, but I feel that the readers of this book would be better served if Mr. Cousineau used lees brains and more heart."
3,"fast to arrive, slow to return","I made an error and purchased incorrect item. the order was delivered in a timely matter, but return procedure slow. my account was credited, less 25%."
5,Great Book,I'm reading this book like I'm reading about my family history. This book is what the written word is about.Mz Lynn
5,My favorite hair product!,This is one of the best products I've ever used for detangling and making my hair look a little thicker. Love this product and just wish it was a bit easier to find.
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad","I couldn't even finish one they were so bad. And I'm not a picky person. My son ""the nut lover"" took one bite and spit it in the trash. VERY BAD!!!"
2,Depends on who you are...,"I bought these treats thinking they would be a tasty treat. I cannot stand to eat them. Other members in my family cannot stand to eat them either. However, I have shared them with other people who actually like them and ask for one everytime they see me. I would guess if your not used to sugary treats, this may be for you. but if your looking for a guilty pleasure sugary snack, pass on this and go with some other treat!"
4,One of the SOUTH's Best artists,"Aside from Eightball's LOST last year, Devin put out the second best album that came from the south last year. It was truly overlooked and underrated by the top hip hop magazines. His lyrics are very explicit on some of the songs, but on others he gives knowledge and insight on life. ""Write & Wrong"" is the tightest track."
2,"Poorly written, only mildly amusing","Parker's prose is mediocre at best. The awkward dialogue is the most embarrassing part of her writing. The story itself is mildly interesting, although the mystery is not complex and the resolution lacks drama and suspense. The villains are murderous, pederast monks: they rape boys because it makes them more monstrous, of course. Not because it has anything to do with the mystery. But their abuse of boys makes no sense: Parker claims that they attach themselves to boys because Buddhist monks aren't allowed to be with women. Why Parker's faux-monks would pay attention to that rule, but not to the rule forbidding murder and theft, is beyond me. She never addresses this paradox - no doubt she's never thought of it. The main character is an interesting creation, though I wish another, more talented, writer had thought of him."
1,Poor imitation of Judge Dee,these books are a very poor imitation of the Judge Dee Mysteries by Robert von Gulik. Find the Judge Dee books rather than these wannabe books.
3,wedge,Like the height but they gave me blisters. It would have been better in the material was straight across instead of crossed so little toes don't get rubbed raw.
4,SURPRISED!,Very happy that i bought this collection. The only reason i didnt give this collection a 5 star is that the music in some of these movies is horrible. During the music part of the movies i would turn the volume down. Still well worth the $6.00 total i paid for this collection.
4,"Quartet improves over ""I'll Be There for You""",I loved the first album but the songs and guitar work on this album are much improved and it seems to reflect the additional touring the band has done. I love it.
5,Pay no mind to these other reviews,"Okay...So maybe it's not really a 5 - star, but hey it was quite a good flick to watch. Sure you may have seen all these characters before and the story has been done a few times but come on folks. A good movie is a good movie and this is a good movie. The cast is great, the director is great, and maybe the characters and story have been done a few times because they're good and they're worth seeing again. Everybody jumps for joy when a new Elmore Leonard movie comes out and they are all very similar. By the way this movie is a lot like an Elmore Leonard story. Anyhow folks, just take it easy, sit back , enjoy the film, 'cause you know you want to.Peace...Out"
2,"Great concept, horrible execution","The concept of this film is downright brilliant--a maze of betrayal and corruption and kidnapping-gone-wrong...or did it? It's too bad that the script and/or the editing is so sloppy and choppy that I frequently found myself wincing at such poor filmmaking. The gratuitous sex might be a turn-on for some (it wasn't for me), but the only really worthwhile aspects of this movie are the idea itself and the actors, who have gifted this writer/director with far better performances than he deserves. If you're a fan of any of the actors, you might watch it if you have nothing better to do. Otherwise, skip it."
1,Sandbagged by Region designation,"Guess it was my fault because I didn't understand the Region 2 designation, and that only Region 1 titles are playable in the United States unless you have a special set-up. As far as I'm concerned, Region 2 DVD's shouldn't even be sold in the U.S. When I went back and looked at the description of the DVD, I now see that there is a warning; however, since a lot of us assume that any DVD sold in the U.S. is playable in the U.S., I just didn't look deep enough. Total waste of money. I didn't return it because I just didn't want to bother (something these sellers hope we will feel), so I just threw it away. Shame on Amazon for even selling these incompatible DVD's."
4,A very good story,"I thought that this was honestly one of the author's better books. Again I loved her attention to historical detail and I found the intricate storyline fascinating. I adored the H, he was a combination of everything I love in a romantic hero but he wasn't perfect either, which gave him a believable edge.The reason I deducted a star is because at times the h was very annoying and insecure. She dashed off to follow the H at the drop of a hat and for me that stretched credibility, and got her into trouble more times than not. It seemed out of place for the times."
4,Good Public Education Tool,"I volunteer in public education for a large fire department. This is truly the best book I have found on the fire department geared towards younger children. This book thoroughly and accurately covers the fire department and the equipment used. The story is easy for children to follow, and is well illustrated. There is even a public safety message at the end, encouraging kids to be fire safe."
1,Poorly written,"Wilson's trials and tribulations across Africa should have provided excellent fodder for an amusing and entertaining read, but this book disappoints. The writing lacks impact, and the few attempts at humor fall flat. The writer also falls into the common travel writers trap of failing to examine the behavior of those he meets - both his fellow travellers on the overland tour and the locals, and simply accepts and in some cases idealizes the local culture, and criticizes his trip mates without context. The book overwhelmingly suggests that Wilson and his wife are the only two people on the tour who are suited to such a journey, and is filled with smug satisfaction at their self anointed superiority. This book is not a patch onSwahili for the Broken Hearted: Cape Town to Cairo by Any Means Necessarywhich is recommended instead."
3,An Interesting Movie!,This is an interesting movie about a bank robber who hijacked a plane and jumped out with a parachute to be pursued by the law but never found. BTW: There really was a bank robber who called himself D.B. Cooper and he did jump out of a plane but this movie is fantasy and is the directors take on what might have happened but shouldn't be taken as actual fact but as a fantasty theory. It was an interesting movie with a good cast which I believe included Robert Duvall and Treat Williams and is worth a rental.
3,Bare-bones example of lease vs. buy,"Presents an example of the analysis to decide lease vs. borrow for an asset. Without finance training I could roughly follow the text. The text refers to tables that are not included in the article. My guess from the occasional typos is that this article was scanned, hence the lack of tables. A serious deficiency."
3,Somewhat less than noteworthy,"Knowing it was nominated for Best Musical Score and after being entranced by his music to The Illusionist, I eagerly looked forward to Glass' music to Notes on a Scandal. After repeated listenings it falls short of my expectations. There just isn't enough to it. It seems somewhat spartan and uninspired. Themes are understated but pleasant. It almost feels like simple background music that does not have much power to lift or color a scene. The Illusionist is far better, nearly hypnotic, and should have been nominated for an Oscar for Best Musical Score."
4,Boogie Woogie,"I love this dude. Memphis Slim. He got blues all ova da place. You know he soakin in it. Some great blues piano, but he should try to settle down a little bit. He's got all ten fingers going all the time. After 35 minutes or so you've had enough and right about then, it's over. A solid 4"
3,It just okay,"I've used probably over 30 different air freshener, but squash scent is always my favorite. The scent is self is okay, but still prefer Air Spenser. The only downside is that the scent doesn't spread over the entire car, you have to be close to smell it. The price is on the more expensive side, I would recommend either the My Shaldan or TreeFrog since it cheaper."
3,Enjoyable But Not Spectacular,"The album is a mix of music, some bluegrass and some more bluesy. You can definitely hear the Belá Fleck influence on some of the tunes. Many of the songs kind of give you the feel of Trischka trying to make the song as difficult as possible to be impressive while losing some of the simplicity of banjo music. One such song that does however hit the mark is Esher's Waltz. This complex song gives you the feel of walking down and Old Street in Middle America in the 1930's. The standout song of the album is ""The Crow"" surprisingly written and co-performed by none other than actor, comedian Steve Martin. It has a bluegrass feel and tune you won't be able to get out of your head. This song alone is worth the price of the album. You will listen to this tune over and over."
3,a bit disappointing,"I thought this book looked really interesting. As a high school teacher, I am always intrigued by coming-of-age stories. This one looked a bit quirky but fun. It was... at certain points. I almost walked away from this book several times because it just wasn't holding my attention. Kaplow spends a great deal of time talking about Julius Caesar and about the popular music at the time. If you aren't interested in these things, then, like me, you might not feel as engaged. Overall, though, I'm glad I stuck with it. In the end, the complexities of the characters came through. Don't expect too much from this book and you will enjoy it."
5,NOMINATED,"I see that this title has just been nominated as an ALA BEST BOOK for young adults, and I'm glad to see it get some notice. It can be read, as the Kirkus review said: ""one of the best depictions of male adolescence to ever hit the page"", but I think it's a richer, wider canvas. I'm 28, and it certainly spoke to me: the theatre, celebrity, ego, drama, love. It's my favorite book this year."
5,The Best Soccer game for PC,"I bought this for 20 bucks at Walmart when there was a giveaway sale, and thought I was gonna play a mediocre game. I was totally wrong. The gameplay in this version is excellent, the players look very close to real and the plasticity in their faces has been done away with.the commentary is excellent, and unlike some other soccer games is actually pretty engrossing, cos they dont say the same thing over and over again. Scoring a goal is not so easy in the professional mode and that should keep you motivated to get better, and when you do score a goal, its an awesome simulation of players doing their antics and waving to the crowd.I won the World Cup finally in this game, and the celebrations are fun to watch. Definitely the best FIFA soccer game I've played."
1,Sent me wires for a Toyota not a Mercedes as requested.,"The exterior packaging was fine but the actual product package was beat up. When the day to take my car into the shop finally came, I discovered that the wires were not for a Mercedes but rather for a Toyota. The Amazon match showed it was the correct item for my car. I have had several items that were not a match as indicated. I would use caution buying parts on Amazon until they are more accurate with their matching or offer a guaranteed match."
4,Beautiful edition,"This is a beautifully produced edition. It looks like each page has been hand crafted. It is well written and comprehensive, and more than amply illustrated. One might wish for a little more depth on each of the topics, but otherwise this is an excellent book for a beginner who is interested in the general topic."
2,It was okay,"I ordered this hoping that it would have some of her idea's and such in it, and it didn't i was sadly let down. For me it was a waste of money. I ended up throwing out over half of the content and kinda using the rest. It was more for a place to store my original idea's not to get idea's. I think there are better things out there."
2,Very disappointed!!,"I was expecting much more from Martha!! I wonder if she evens knows what this planner has (or actually, doesnt have) in it! I would not recommend purchasing this. Definitely go to a book store and preview the planner before purchasing. The only things I like about it are that its full sized with a lot of places to store misc. papers and the advice that comes with it. But, I subsrube to MS weddings, put the advice in there. I like the Simple Stunning wedding planner much better. I felt the MS Planner was a whole lot of nothing."
1,Hardly a keepsake!,"Expensive and disappointing.The first one I bought broke within a few days (the binder fully detatched from the outer cover). I returned it. The second one was crushed - dog-eared and scruffy. I returned that one too. When finally the third one I bought broke (again the binder detatched), I resorted to a Staples folder with Martha's inserts.Over-rated, but vaguely useful."
3,martha stewart wedding planner,"metal part of binder was already broken and the bottom part was not connected to the cover part, when I received the book, I had read in your reviews that some people had the binders break early on, and mine was broken at the start. the notebook needs to be re-done, otherwise, the book is good."
1,This Does NOT Work,"Do not waste your money on this, it does not work even though I tried several different keyboards."
1,The product did not work,"That's all, upon plugging it in the adapter didn't work. We ordered 3, it's not really worth it to return them, but we were disappointed. We needed them for a mouse, and when plugged in, the cursor would not move."
2,eh,"quick shipment. Useless product. Needed a ps/2 to usb ""signal"" converter not a plain ps/2 to usb adapter. was cheaper to just buy a new keyboard for 6 bucks."
1,Damn thing didn't work.,"Welp, boy, was I taken for a ride. I thought this would be a fix to my problem, but instead, it just made it worse."
1,keyboard adapter,"the keyboard adapter did not work at all and it was a waste of my five dollars i could have kept. i wish i would have known it wouldn't have worked with my computer before i bought it, i still had to go out to store and buy one that did work. lesson learned i guess"
1,The one I purchased didn't work,"It causes USB errors, I might have got a bad one, but it is so cheap it's not worth the hassle to replace"
1,PS2 TO USB Keyboard Adapter M/F,"This product did not work for me. I have a HP non USB keyboard and wanted to USB my keyboard to my laptop. After setting up the PS2 USB Adapter to my laptop, I could never get a connection even after rebooting several times trying toget it to work. Now I have a USB Adapter that I can't use."
2,Item did not work,"Actually, the adapter was nor reconized by the computer and did not work. The computer would not reconize the keyboard I intended to use it with."
2,did not work,"this item did not work, not sure if it was defective but it did not work. it wasn't worth the effort to file out the claim and get a returns auth to return it. the company did make that offer"
1,"DOES NOT DO THE JOB, DESCRIPTION IS LACKING","This simple adapter does not let me use a PS2 keyboard on a USB port. The description is misleading. It does not work. It is NOT a converter. In my case I need a PS2 keyboard to USB converter. This was not an expensive mistake, but delays my application."
1,Didn't work for me either,"When I bought it, said it works with keyboards that were shipped originally with an adapter like this one. Mine was. I have the old school Dell keyboard shipping with my original Dell computer (free keyboard?), and this adapter did not work. Got the same error messages on my Windows -> Unknown device.Can I say I love Amazon though?"
2,Did not work,When I plugged it into the key bored then the computer it did not work but at least I got my money bak.
1,Didn't work!!,"Need this to hook up a left handed keyboard for an employee, but it didn't work. When I plugged it in, the key board had no power."
2,Awesome for the first 2 months then it died,"I bought this at a local Home Depot and loved it for the first month. Then it died. Brought it back and exchanged it and now this one has died too, just before the 90 day guarantee. So I will now be taking this one back and getting a full refund and shopping elsewhere. Too bad because this worked well while it worked. It was much, much quieter than other models I've owned."
5,Wife loved them,"They were a little smaller than I expected, but seem well made and look nice. They matched a necklace my wife already had quite well."
3,Decent memoir about a very lucky holocaust survivor,"No one can doubt how much Michael Skakun loves his father and how proud he is of his fathers amazing story of survival. However. I would have toned down the flowery writing, after all, in a biography there really no way of knowing all the expressions of the faces in the room, the smells, the sounds, etc. I also would have included a postscript on whether the subject of the book is still alive, where he lives, or where he spent his last days. Too many loose ends for me, but a book that is very good and worth reading."
3,Be sure to buy used and cheap!,"Folks, this is just a York 25 lb. plate and a plastic disk to cover the plate. The plastic is purely cosmetic and isn't functionally necessary. I purchased mine used for less than $10 and am glad I did. These sell for less than $30 at fitness supply places. If you can't find it used here, look for a flat 25 lb ""standard"" weight plate (not Olympic size hole) with no rubber coating and hand grip holes. Really, any fairly thin weight plate and a couple oversize washers would do."
2,It's just not the same...,"As stated in other reviews, the majority of these are NOT original recordings and you CAN tell. The songs are classics and there is just ""something"" missing from them. It got 2 stars from me because at least you can sing along with them. I bought the CD set when this site was CDNow. At least Amazon.com gives people a chance to post a review so others won't make the same mistake."
2,I felt like I have been cheated for the past 2 days!!,"I felt good about the book uptil the middle of the book, it got annoying how the heroine Sally kept comparing everything to the devil and I HATE the ending, it does not tie up loose ends!!! It was a copout!! I do NOT recommend this book for ANYONE!!!!!"
3,"Selection of the Words: Interesting, Definitions: Difficult to Understand","I love to learn new words and enhance my vocabulary every day. I bought this book as the design of the pages was looking rather simple and friendly. But, once I started to study the words, I found out that definitions of some of the words are rather complicated to explain the meaning/s of the words. The example sentences are not helpful either. Still, I try to get the most of the book by checking the difficult-to-understand words via other sources."
3,Hard to Get Through..but takes an interesting turn,"I'm a freshman in high school, and our book project is to read a Tale of Two Cities. I can't say that it was a piece of cake. It took me about a week and a few days to get through the first book. All I kept thinking over and over was ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times..."" and it started to make me crazy. I finally got up to a little past book two, and it became interesting. I don't recommend this book to people with a limited amount of time to read it in, because it won't happen. For those of you that have the time, it's a great book."
3,Buy Stella Parton's Country Cookin' instead!,"This was Stella Parton's first cookbook, and all of the recipes are repeated in Stella Parton's Country Cookin' -- a wonderful book with much larger, clearer text. more recipes, and IMPROVED versions of the recipes in this one (which often seems to show missing ingredients), and substitutes for those unavailable outside of the deep south (such as Italian Seasoning instead of Uncle So-And-So's). I therefore strongly recommend instead buying Ms. Parton's subsequent cookbook, Stella Parton's Country Cookin', which is printed in much larger and clearer text, and includes corrected versions of all these recipes, plus many more."
2,Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Cream,"I thought that it was smelly, I am 48 years old and I did not see a difference in my skin. My mother is 67years old I let her try it and in a few days I did see a significant difference in her skin, so I gave it to her. I truly could not tolerate the smell, it smells like something one would use on a car engine"
1,"One section missing, One section duplicated",I had two attempts at purchasing a copy of this book. Both times it was misbound - one section missing but a second section duplicated. In the end Amazon.com gave up and refunded my money. Disappointing as the rest of the book was interesting and useful.
5,Harbinger Ankle Cuff,"Our gym no longer had cuffs available, so I ordered these based on reviews that I read on-line. Very pleased and would recommend. I use with about 90 lbs of weight and these work well. May be borderline for use above 100 lbs as they will rub against your skin."
2,mechanic,the price you people want for this fitting is over double what i can buy it here in town local.
3,"should've been called ""memoirs.""","sadly i must say that i was very let down by this book, as i was expecting, and very much hoping that mr. morgan would regale me with stories of his experiences from his 28 years of driving a greyhound.would love to have heard about what type of equipment he drove, and runs he had.would buy the sequel, if he hit on more details."
5,WHAT IF IS THE BEST EVER!!!!!!!!!!,"MIL- I love what if. I think Ruben and Kayne are great together. Ruben is a smooth, unique singer. He can work up an audience without all the drama. I think I'm sorry 2004 shows off a lot of his heart and talents. Ruben is versitile. There are no limits to his talent. The man is just a blessing to the music world. Thank God for Ruben and his gift to us all. I can't wait to see and here more from Ruben. He keeps it real, no faking about Ruben. It would have been a sin to pick anyone else over Ruben. AMERICA PICKED RUBEN,I AM PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN AND I AM PROUD OF AMERICA FOR HAVING A REAL EAR FOR MUSIC. MIL"
1,Well What Can I say? RAP? CRAP?,My goodness what happened to ruben studdard? Where did that soulful sound go. The round of mound has turned into mush as this single remix has me curling my toes. Do not recommend unless you like the status quo of the rap crap thats out there.
4,Walkie talkie?,"Super convenient for those of us that don't have the adapters installed already in our cars, but the size of the unit is a little cumbersome, especially when the antenna is in full extension, sort of like a walkie talkie in its shape and use. Overall, it's a great concept and the reception is pretty good. Tends to become a little problematic around metropolitan areas because there are limited channels to choose from. I looked at some of the other reviews and finally settled on this product. To date, I'm happy with it."
4,Ghosts and pirates make exciting historical fiction!,"This story takes place in Clare, Ireland, where greedy developers want to destroy a small mountain looking for gold. Jessie is aided by a visiting American cousin - and the ghost of Grania O'Malley, a woman pirate."
2,This is NOT Dance Music.,"Like a previous review stated, this is not dance music. The songs they chose are not dance songs. There is perhaps one or two tracks that are ok, but the rest is not worth it. I would not recommend this cd."
2,"still in the ""pop"" section","The offspring have somewhat changed there sound, but not by much. They try to sound more ""raw"" in a few songs, but they still stay in the pop-rock section. I wouldnt consider this ""punk"" anymore. over all I think the album was very poor."
4,Great!,"This a great album and worth buying if you're a true Offspring fan, although tracks 12 and 11 are pretty stupid.Da Hui, (Track 11) is just full of cussing and pisses me off because OfFspring isn't a cursing band.When you're in prison is just plain stupid.Every song except those two are fantastic! Buy this album, you won't regret it."
2,The Offspring's time has come and gone.,"After how good Smash and Ixnay were, I stood by the Offspring through Americana and Conspiracy of One. They had a good song or two, but that was it. With this album, however, I no longer consider the Offspring my favorite band. I have waited for this for 3 years, and for what? The only good song on this album is Race Against Myself. If they ever return to their Ignition or Smash roots, hopefully somebody will tell me because I will no longer be following the Offspring."
5,Great punk album,all the songs are good esp Cant get my head around you and race against myself. Im not a fan of when your in prison its kinda stupid but novertheless its a great album.
4,I can't beleive im doing this...,ok either you hate this cd or you love it. i waited a whole year for this i was dissapointed i mean it was supposed to sound like ignition (well some songs do) and when i heard da hui its just made me feel like it was gonna classic offspring. but i guess they don't wanna go back there. its not a bad cd it has its moment (oh one other thing troubling me about the reviews here worst hang over ever is not pop its ska they also used it in what happened to you) hit that i like i think its goin in a new directio and if they made a whole cd like that i would set my pubes on fire but for one song don't bash it its hard to come up with something new all the time...but i guess in closing yea it could have been a lot better waiting pretty much a whole year for it but not bad
4,Not Bad,"I'll admit, i've never been a big offspring fan; I'm more into Sublime. But having already bought all of the sublime cd's, and seeing this on sale, i decided to try something new. It's wasn't a disappointing cd. I actually bought the cd because i liked ""hit that"" from hearing it on the radio. ""Worst Hangover Ever"", despite being most people's least favorite, is probably my favorite song on the album because it has that sublime feel to it. All in all, it's a prett good cd."
3,SOME GOOD SONGS...,"SPLINTER got some good songs like LIGHTNING ROD, THE NOOSE, LONG WAY HOME and HIT THAT...By this time, Offspring really really slow down their sound and made a much more acessible kind of pop hardcore..."
2,Not comfortable for jogging...,"I got this stroller as a gift and just used it for the first time a week ago and I still have sore thumbs. The handle bar is not very ergonomic as it is unadjustable and feels awkward to grip while jogging. It does ride very smoothly on sidewalks and grass. I may have been gripping it wrong, but had trouble turning corners otherwise. I had to hold it with my thumbs facing inward while gripping with my fists. The other complaint I have is with the straps. They do not fit together into a center base that snaps together like my car seat, so it's hard to get the baby properly secured. My baby doesn't like it as well as his regular stroller. I will give it another try in a few weeks, but for now, my hands are too sore. This would probably be good for just longer walks... It's cheap, so I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Great Stroller for the $,"I love ths stroller because it is inexpensive, and has great shocks. It glides easily over those bumps in the sidewalk. My only complaints are it's manueverability and that it doesn't have head support. I used the head support from the car seat."
3,Instep 5k stroller,"After searching for some time, I found this stoller to be a good buy. The 10K version is for sale online and costs much more--this model is very comparable.I'd give this 4 stars if the brakes worked better, they are very difficult to adjust."
1,NOT A BOOK,"Read the abstract well! This is not a book, but merely, a review of the book. Do not pay $6 for a short review."
4,I had this toaster for quite some time.,"I had this toaster and I loved it. Unfortunatly, the sensor broke and I could not get a replacement. It works wonderfully! The auto lowering is incredible!.I highly recommend this!"
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"I searched for a Farberware toaster to replace the one I'd had for nearly 25 yrs. I chose this one because of it's ""classic"" look. I put it on my wish list and my daughter bought it for me for Christmas. In short order the thing just started sparking. This is a total waste of money. DO NOT BUY."
2,hard to use,"I don't know how to make it a smoother use, but it is one handed for a person with REALLY strong hands."
2,salt mill,"Unlike the matching pepper mill which came directly from Amazon in original packaging with instructions and boxed, this arrived wrapped in bubble wrap and in a plain yellow envelope...with no instructions. I must use both hands to work it. Sure hope I didn't get a previously returned one."
5,salt mill,"We own this salt mill and we love it and so do our adult children and friends. Ours is about a year old now. We bought it so that we could use sea salt instead of table salt and to control the quality of salt we eat when dinning out or away from home. I often carry it in my purse when we travel or go out to dinner. We highly recommend this mill, we are getting one each for our adult children for stocking stuffers this year. It makes a great gift for friends and family who enjoy sea salts. Vic Firth is a trusted brand, although we first knew them as makers of fine percussion instruments this kitchen tool continues to follow their high quality product reputation."
4,Little Magician,I got the salt grinder as a gift and I think it's the cat's meow! It is so much more convenient to salt food with one hand. The thumb pump works well and the grinder creates a nice shower of salt over the food. The only quibble (preventing a 5 star review) is that the mill has a small capacity and tends to spill a bit in the re-filling process.
5,FP Planet Heroes Turbo Shuttle,"My 4 year old son loves this. Great for imaginary/fantasy play. Makes noise, shoots things (safely). Makes more noise. Seems very durable, along the lines of the FP Rescue Heroes series. Very pleased with the purchase."
5,Scott Turow-> the upfront version,This book is definately more realistic than Scott Turow (whom I do love his book too). It's definately recommended for the liberal at heart which is why some peeps don't rate this book high. This book is excellent b/c it brings into light the false idea of going to Harvard to do public service. I'm sorry but if you want public service and have some ivy at the same time goto Yale. Ok... I'm a bit biased... this author is my Latin teacher from high school's son... but I couldn't understand the low ratings... this book is more for public interest students who wish to enter an ivy leage school more than a student who wants the law school experience (although it's pretty funny to compare the differences with Mr. Turow's novel).
1,"A bitter, self-righteous disappointment","Unless you are a bleeding heart liberal with the world view of a sixth grader and you plan to do legal aid for sick puppies after graduating from law school, don't buy this book! The author tries way too hard to ram his far left politics down the reader's throat, repeatedly attacking big bad corporate lawyers who work for the rich and powerful. Then he turns around and talks about how he spent a summer at Ropes & Gray and accpeted an offer from Covington & Burling but felt really really guilty about it!! Give me a break!"
5,"David Russell, Always Dependable","This is a wonderful CD, typical of the excellent quality David Russell always provides. It has many of Miguel Llobet's Catalan folk songs on it. They are fairly short but beautiful. This CD gives me something to strive for as I try to play this music myself."
4,Perfect Solution,"Everything I was looking for - now all I need is the time to build my own woodfired oven.Build Your Own Earth Oven, 3rd Edition: A Low-Cost Wood-Fired Mud Oven; Simple Sourdough Bread; Perfect Loaves"
1,Truly Disappointed,"The authors propensity for villains with schizophrenia or MPDand carrying multiple story lines in a single book is just getting old.The story jumps around so much that it becomes quite hard to follow.The plot is murky and although I don't mind foreshadowing I don't liketo be beaten to death with it (telling us someone's going to die once isthrilling, more than that and it loses its impact and almost becomesinsulting ""ok, I GET it they're going to die, get on with the story.""). Icame across Ghoul a few years ago in a used book shop and wasenthralled now I'm just disappointed and doubt I'll read or buy furtherbooks from this author and that saddens me."
2,Primal Scream,"The book I read was called Primal Scream. It was an ok book but I really didn't like it. It was kind of confusing but I got through it. The book is about a group of people in a jungle and they are looking for killers. Animals start to attack them. They have people give them strange gifts. People get body parts in boxes. One time this guy got a shrunken head as a gift. They would get arms, eyes, weird things like that.I thought it was a little weird. If you like weird books then read this one. It is called Primal Scream By Michael Slade. Do you like suspense, do you like excitement then read This book. Its funny, scary and suspenseful. Maybe you will get a shrunken head too!"
4,Grammys 2007,I thought it was a pretty good selection of songs. I like the way it was put together. I won't say it's the best I've heard but I liked it.
4,Grammy Songs,Knew many of the songs which is why I purchased but even those I didn't are good. Great variety and sampling of nominees for 2007
2,"A long, slow slide","I've been buying this guide for years, but it has grown more and more out of touch. Many smaller films are omitted, suggesting the book aims at a mass market, yet film-school elitism infects the reviews that do appear: One of last year's most acclaimed and enjoyed films, Memento, gets 1-1/2 stars and a snooty review. I'm shopping around for a new guide next year."
3,An Outdated Effort,"I like movies very much, I own so many and I appreciate every genre. Years ago, Leonard Maltin was my trusted movie critics. But cinema industry now days is not like the old days; movies are not being evaluated just for the story/music/cinematography, they are also appreciated for their high quality visual effects and actions. Cinema industry has entered the 21st century, but the problem is, Leonard Maltin has not yet.Though, Maltin's guide still an excellent reference for pre 70s classics."
3,It helps,"I have hardwood floors thru out my house. When the cat pees I wipe it up and then use clorox wipes on the floot. The directions say not to disinfect the spot, but I'm afraid it will smell if I don't. After I spray the hardwood floor I blot the product a little. When it dries you can see where I sprayed the product. It has helped me, but we haven't eliminated the problem.Fay"
5,Great show,"I think that the show only got better when Don Knotts joined the cast in the fourth season. His enthusiasm and humor is second to none, and these episodes are so funny!! If you haven't ever watched Three's Company before, you're in for a timeless treat! Make to sure to buy this season to ensure that Anchor Bay will release all 8 seasons of the show, and hopefully the spin-offs"
4,classic comedy,"John Ritter and company deliver top-notch stuff from their classic TV show. I intend to purchase all eight seasons. Good writing, good acting, good production, and it survives the test of time. They don't make shows like this anymore. Filmed before a live studio audience. No ""canned"" laughter!"
3,"not bad, not great","Bought a cpl of these for fun in the pool...works great for my daughter, she mayb 30 lbs; works ok for my son, he bout 50 lbs; for my friends and myself, well we better off not tryin to use them. For the price i paid i thought it would work better since it is geared for adult use, im bout 165 lbs and some of my friends are less...wont pull any of us through the water without kickin feet like crazy..."
1,Beware: Misleading Instructions,We had the Seascooter Dolphin for one hour! It sank when is was momentarily let go in the lake. Perhaps Sea Doo needs a dictionary:Positive buoyancy is where an object displaces water more than its own weight. It floats. Negative buoyancy is where an object displaces water less than its own weight. It sinks.Sea-Doo Seascooter Dolphin Water Scooter
3,"Still good, but not great","I am not a great fan of contemporary Christian music which is why I have loved Selah. Their fresh arrangements of beautiful traditional hymns have always inspired me and I was so excited when I ordered the newest CD. However,while it is very pretty, this CD just doesn't inspire me like the others."
3,It's just not the same...,"I have ""Hiding Place"" and I love it. This one just didn't touch me like 'Hiding Place'. My mom has 2 others and she agrees with me. It's just not the same without Nichol. I wondered what happened with Nichol and found that she had a baby and wanted to have a family life. Go Nichol! But it's not the same without the brother/sister team. The new addition's name is Amy Perry. And Todd confess he used to be the loudest in the group. But he can't say that anymore! Now HE'S asking for his monitor to be turned up!"
4,I love this group,I have found my new favorite Christian group. I bought this CD for myself and will be asking for a few of their other ones for Christmas.
5,Tarzan Boy! A Beauchief House Classic!,"""Night to night, Gimme the other, gimme the other..."" how can you fail to sing and dance along to this 80's classic! Whether it be cruising through the streets of Saundersfoot or doin the legendary 'Horse dance' in Tenby's Beauchief Hotel!It's an absolute must of a party song for every occasion!Long live the spirit of 'Baltimora' down in Tenby!So without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, I compere for the evening, Mike Kirby, give to you 'Tazan Boy-Mania!'"
5,Starting Point for Complexity and Leadership,"This book should be the starting point for anyone interested in the implications of complexity theory and leadership. Wheatley starts with the physical sciences as a starting point and then applies lessons learned in modern physics to lessons we can learn in modern organizations. Social science research including management ""science"" have sought the holy grail of objectivity and rationalism that we all thought that the physical and biological sciences were based on. Wheatley reveals to the lay person that our assumptions about hard science were not correct and helps to build a new foundation for leadership scholarship based on the complexity that permeates all scientific inquiry."
2,Tedious and overly ambitious,"I don't know if the revised version of this book is any better than the original 1992 version, which I read. But that version, I can assure you, is disappointing. What I thought would be a fascinating and well-written work revealed itself to be pretentious, tedious, and confusing. I couldn't wait to turn each page...not because it was a gripping read, but because each turned page brought me closer to the end. I think the topic is intriguing, but a better, less pretentious author could have taken the concepts and produced a book of real worth."
3,Worth it,"My wife needed this book for her grad school class even though a newer edition was available at the time. However, this book was sufficient enough and worth getting at the discount price on Amazon rather than the campus bookstore."
2,It was okay...,"This book was another in a required reading list for a class I was taking. I'm usually not a fan of reading anything I ""have"" to, and considering that, this was enjoyable to a degree. Translation: I didn't hate it.I've only given it 2 stars because it was NOT so well written that it compelled me to continue. What compelled me to continue was the fact that I was required to read it.I didn't get a whole lot out of it, but I did find myself underline something perhaps thrice."
3,New cord!,"This was a great buy, and it came to me as a new item - never used! We really needed one - Thank you."
3,Review of Baby's My First Photo Albulm,"Really cute, but too expensive. I have not used them yet as they are gifts so I can't really say how well they work with the photo's being protected"
3,plastic sleeves are weird,"This is a nice photo album for young toddlers, but the plastic sleeves are odd. It's hard to get the pictures into them and the photos stick them, so I'm not thrilled with this product. That being said, my 16 month old on can look through it, bend the pages, and basically cause little to no damage to the photos. He also cannot pull them out of the plastic sleeves, so I'm pleased with that part."
4,Baby's First Photo Album,"""Baby's My First Photo Album of Family & Friends"" is wonderful. I purchased it for my grandson who is 12 mos. and he smiles when looking at the faces of family. It holds a good number of pictures and is very strong. He loves it! My only wish would be that the cover were plastic and not cloth or white. I also purchased a similar album for my first grandson 13 years ago and it was a favorite activity for him. This time I got one for our home and one for the child's home. It is a fun way to teach little ones the names of family and friends."
3,It's good enough,"Product is basic, colors of cover okay but brighter would be better; a good number of pages but they are plastic and wrinkled making the final product okay but lacking."
4,George Foreman outdoor grill,I purchased this product a long time ago and I still use it every year. Easy and inexpensive to use. Clean-up could be better
3,electric bbq grill 4 stars,"cooks and bbq's great. io give it 4 stars. if an has an apt or propety where they cannot use a standard charcoal or gsa grill, i highly rccomend this produc"
3,gives food a funny flavor,"When making fresh hambergers; it gave it a funny flavor. When using pre-cooked food; it worked a little better. When you don't have a grill, it's ok."
5,Easy as it gets!!,"Plug it in, heat it up, and grill. Clean up is a breeze. I bought a Stainless Steel grill for $2200 and it doesn't work as well as the George."
4,Cooks and cleans well.,"I've cooked only steaks on it so far and it cleans easily, even after you leave greasy food on there for a few days after you forget to clean it immediately. I cooked 1inch thick T-Bones with no problem. You wouldn't be able to get something that thick WELL done without burning the outside, but who wants a good cut of meat cooked all the way through anyway?Cooks thinner meats really fast, so be sure to keep a close eye on your food the first couple of times you use it to observe the speed and ensure your preference is met. Thick or thin, my steaks came out juicy!"
4,Drip pan is too small,"My only problem is the ""convenient"" drip pan. Maybe i'm the only one who likes to cook more than one thing at a time; but anyways, the fat and juices of the meat quickly overflowed the tiny drip pan and ran out the bottom making a mess everywhere. The ""convenient"" drip pan is located under the hot metal plate and you just try and empty it while cooking. Luckily I was cooking outside!! The grill works surprisingly well and the food produced was just excellent. Be aware of this problem or you might not be so lucky."
1,Three words say it all: Made in China,"The heating element stopped working within 6 months of purchase.The unit also continually tripped an indoor breaker. Maybe I canuse it as an outdoor planter, although the condo board wouldsurely disapprove."
3,GEORGE IS GOOD !,"THIS IS THE 3RD FOREMAN GRILL I HAVE ORDERED, EACH DIFFERENT. FOREMAN MAKES A GOOD PRODUCT, HOWEVER, I AGREE WITH A FEW OTHER COMMENTS THAT THE ""WOBBLE"" OF THE TOP PORTION OF THE GRILL MAKES ONE HAVE TO BE VERY, VERY CAUTIOUS, ESPECIALLY IF CHILDREN ARE ABOUT. I WISH THE GRILL WOULD REALLY ""GRILL"". ALL HIS GRILLS COOK IN THE SAME MANNER. SOMETIMES THE MEATS APPEAR MORE STEAMED THAN GRILLED. NEVER CRISPY AS WITH OTHER GRILLS. THAT'S WHY I GAVE IT A 3.THE PRICE WAS NOT LOW---------OUR LOCAL DEPT STORE HAD A BETTER PRICE BUT I SAVED THE TAX AND IT EVENED OUT. I AM A SENIOR AND THE GAS GRILL HAS GONE TO ITS REWARD AS I CAN NO LONGER HANDLE PROPANE TANKS, CYLINDERS ETC. SO ELECTRIC GRILLS ARE THE CHOICE OF THIS HOUSEHOLD."
4,worked fine,"Recently purchased and have used the grill with great results on steaks, burgers, and ribs. Pretty much went by grilling times in the enclosed manual which worked fine. Found clean up to be easy if first sprayed with a non stick cooking oil. Have to wait on a durability review as I haven't owned it long enough."
5,"Husband very pleased, perfect for condo balcony!","My husband had been so disappointed that we could not use a charcoal, or propane grill on our beach condo balcony....this G F Grill is the perfect answer!!! No mess, and very happy with how everything cooked....the steaks, chicken, bacon, chops....anything we have tried!!!"
1,Not really an outdoor grill.,You can not use this as an outdoor grill if you don't have an electrical outlet to plug it in.
2,fantastic,"I really love it, I was always afraid to light those gas grills, now I just go out plug it in and put dinner on."
1,had to buy another on,We had to return it as soon as we got it because it NEVER worked but we received our refund bought another george eoreman grill like this and LOVE it
4,Meet my needs.,"I use this grill on a small balcony for quick mini-bbqs. It is my primary grill; I do not have time/space to deal with lighting and dumping a charcoal grill.This grill was super easy to assemble, it is easy to clean up, it heats quickly and it makes very tasty food. Very affordable, worth every penny of the price. I recommend it."
4,george foreman does the trick,"After a long debate between a gas or charcoal grill...I realized I didn't want to deal with either when I came across the Foreman indoor/outdoor electrical grill. I was looking for something easy to use, big enough to grill food for ~4 people, and most of all, easy to clean. The foreman delivers all...with a minor exception of the easy to clean. The grill cooks perfectly and the instructional cooking guide that comes with the grill helps. If you have a small kitchen sink (like I do), the grill was a pain to clean. But the foreman grill sponges do help. All in all I'm happy with my purchase and for $69.99, I couldn't ask for more."
2,Good bearings *EDIT*,"The bearings are good, but I don't know if they are worth 40 dollars. They are not as good as my bones reds which were 13. Although they are not fully worn in. We'll see once they are.*EDIT*I am very upset with my $50.00 purchase. I have been riding them for awhile now and they are starting to get loud and annoying and not even very fast."
4,Great longboard bearing!,"I bought these for one of my 47"" longboards and they rock! The breakin period is several weeks or roughly 20+ miles but they're cream once you get past it. I board 20-30 miles a week and it still took me around two weeks to get them rolling at their smoothest. Sweet bearings that I expect will outlast any and all competion aside from being smooth, fast and affordable!"
5,Great Bearings,These are really great bearings. Much faster than the conventional abec-7's I was using.
2,"Good movies, bad transfers","The box claims these are digitally re-mastered and sound enhanced. That's not true. The films are all very grainy and the sound is awful. They are fine for watching on a small TV, and fine if you just want to see them. Don't expect a quality picture or sound. You get what you pay for.Edward G. Robinson is fantastic, so content wise, these are a safe bet for a little over a buck per film."
4,A Good Source for Guitar Tabs,"A lot of guitar tablature on the internet is often wrong, if not incomplete. This book provides sheet music for all of OK Computer, in both tab form and regular musical notation. For guitarists and fans of radiohead, its worth the buy."
5,Works Great for My Notebook!,"My Notebook keep over heating and with this cooler it hasn't done it once. It is very quit and keeps my notebook very cool. A great product, highly recommend."
5,Cool Pad for Your Laptop,"I really like my Notepal. It keeps my MacBook Pro nice and cool. I notice how it gets quite a bit warmer when I take it off the Notepal. The Notepal is very light and cool to the touch. It has two fans in the bottom wich are extremely quiet. So quiet that I have put my fingers in the fan to see if they were running (yes they were and no I didn't lose a finger). The fans draw their power from the laptop through a USB port. The Notepal has an extra USB port so you don't lose any ports in the balance. My only complain and it is a very minor one is that the Notepal is a bit too narrow for my MacBook Pro, but since it cools like a champ, I am not too worried bout it.I recommend it heartily."
3,They Need to Say Which Exatly size it's for you,"Well, I got disapointed when I found the cooler didn't fit in my 17' laptop. Maybe I was too stupid when I didn't calculate it before to buy it. I hope that you can have put in the announce: Cooler for 15'or Cooler for 17'notebooks."
5,Amazing Book!,This book is wonderful. It is one of the few stepparenting books I've read (and I've read a lot) that speaks to the heart and helps one see the positive in the situation. I love this book.
5,the night they raided minskys,yes i receive the night they raided minskys and i just love also i had a vhs tape of it i let someone borrow it they gave it back to me and i just miss it so much and when i saw it on line amazon i knew i had to get it
1,"""If Only They Could Talk: The Miracles of Spring Farm"" by Bonnie Jones Reynolds","I am very sorry to say that I did not recieve the book I ordered. I paid almost $8 for an very yellowed 1972 copy of ""If Only They Could Talk"" by James Herriot. A wonderful book indeed, but not the book I ordered. I donated it to the women's prison in Mitchellville, IA as the women need ""PG"" books to read. I must give a thumbs down to this vendor as the book I ordered ""If Only They Could Talk: The Miracle of Spring Farm"" by Bonnie Jones Reynolds, and I did not recieve it.Thank you,Jeri"
3,"Interesting Piece of History, but only a piece","After reading this book I really like Lauren Bacall. The author, Ms. Hepburn, while setting out to write about movie making, reveals an insight into herself. Her primary interests are Creative Control, and Creature Comfort. Ms. Bacall, who probably didn't even get a line in the rolling credits in the movie, chipped in whenever a team player was needed - something Ms Hepburn was not.If you are a fan of the movie, this is a must read. There are pieces of fascinating detail, but so much of the ebb and flow of the story missing that you are left wanting more. I never read any hint of anyone, especially the author, in danger of loosing their minds. Descriptions of the locality, weather and working conditions are exquisite."
2,Mediocre,Barely sweet. Could not distinguish the flavor of peanuts over any other nut. Just a rich fatty taste with a hint of alcohol in the background. The packaging led me to believe that these were going to be a wholesome treat both in nutritional value and taste. At the end of the day there are much better protein and health bar solutions.
5,yummy,"These are tasty, sweet and very filling. Yes, the texture is kind of strange, but 16g of protein in one ""ball"" is great! They are also gluten and dairy free. My kind of breakfast!"
2,Thumbs down,"Sent a box of these to a college co-ed. She likes chewy granola bars, and the South Beach Diet meal replacement bars. I thought she might like these. NOT. She describes them as ""nasty"", and didn't even swallow her first bite. Did break the ball apart and the inside wasn't any better than the outside, so she will now gift these to fellow students."
2,Not as nice as last one,I received this in a timely manner. It was not the same quality as my last one which was tan and had a more rugged feel. This feels cheaper and more like plastic....outsourcing again i guess
1,Where's the beef?,"A poor attempt at cashing in on the Da Vinci Code's popularity. I bought this book in the forlorn hope, not of getting a heads-up on Dan Brown's latest whatever, but of gleaning insight into the Knights Templar/Freemason/Mormon connection implied in the book's title. But all the author has to offer is an amalgam of snippets that he's culled from other popular books. That wouldn't be so bad in itself, except that he does not have anything new to suggest or to add to the mix. Waste of time basically. Sorry"
3,not what i thought it was,this bookl is not what i thought it was going to be. it had some good info in it. I give it a good rating for the facts but the way it was compiled was sucky.
5,"Works fine, Great Price. A must have.","I purchased this external drive after my last external drive failed me wiping out my itunes library and most of my data. Now that drive is decorating my shelf with its dust, and this new spiffy drive is working like a charm. It really is plug and play. I loaded it, and it just worked... Awesome. The large capacity means I can get my iTunes library, my recorded shows and hard drive loaded on it with room to spare. Thanks my book."
2,Retired,"The product automatically turns on when plugged in and the handle is moved down from the locked position. Unfortunately the handle is quite heavy, especially with the cord partly attached. It turns on and starts spinning sometimes while plugging it in. Also, I purchased extra brushes as recommended by Amazon for people who had previously purchased the product. The product does not allow for the replacement of original brushes. It works, but it is less than what I expected, and at times may be unsafe."
4,household,we love our small floor polisher - it does a perfect job to do 1800 square feet - we are very satisfied
1,Quit running really quick,"This machine started out great, was pretty loud though. I managed to clean my kitchen floor, which is not a big kitchen, and started to go into the dining room and it quit. Thinking maybe the motor was overheated I did as the instructions stated, unplugged and let it cool off. Plugged it back in and nothing. Very disappointed. I do NOT recommend"
3,Too early to tell,My wife tried it the first time and it left swirl marks on the floor. Going to try it again with new floor cleaner.
3,gloss boss,It does a really good job. I was hoping for a mop I could us all the time. It is a little slow for that . Where there are particularly bad areas it is great. I use on wood floorsa nd tile

2,For specialists only,"I have read half a dozen of Chomsky's mainstream political works (Culture of Terrorism, Necessary Illusions, etc.) and picked up Radical Priorities hoping for more of the same interesting stuff. Reading Chomsky usually requires a fair amount of patience and attention, but this book is at least twice as dense and circuitous as the others I'd read. The intent here seems to be to settle even further down into the details of the facts of particular incidents he is discussing; the effect is thorny and inaccessible writing. This is super if you're doing research on a particular topic, but not if you're looking to understand more of Chomsky's wider view of history and politics. (I'd start with Necessary Illusions if you're looking for an intro to his work, by the way...)"
4,I was so impressed by this book I notebooked most all of it.,"When this book came out in '85, it so affected me I did something I've never done with any full-length book: I copied down in a notebook nearly the entire book in longhand--and I wouldn't write it down unless I agreed with EVERYTHING the authors said. Why I give it 4 stars is the circa 2% I left blanks in the notebook for yet to this day remain blank--I could agree with most of what they said at those points, but not everything. Yet these ~2% concern major, crucial areas no matter how few lines in the book they cover."
5,Having warn out my local library copy I'm buying my own!,Gilies has gone into huge depth with some very close friends and family of Astaire. I found the infomation from his previous dancing partners just supburb.. In case you can't tell I have to be up there with his no. one fan.. Michael Jackson!
2,Disappointed in This Purchase,I was disappointed in theBell Barbie Lil Rider Toddler Value Packwhen it arrived today. It looks cheap and the only Barbie sticker on the helmet is wrinkled. I purchased this along with Barbie Princess Tough Trike for a little girl whose name was on our church's Christmas giving tree. I hope the recipient of this gift is more impressed with it than I am.
3,They could had done better.,"The Movies are Great classics and that is the only reason I did not send them back.They could had done a better job on recording to the DVDs.Video and Audio Quality was some what ok on 2 or 3 movies, but even then they looked as if they use no Contrast,and a continually alot of spotty snow, crackle audio."
5,Best gift ever!,"I had to reorder that Gund Dog ""Spunky"" Compy Cosy for my friend's daughter in Israel: initially it was a part of my gift sent overthere.And 2 years later they asked for the replacement! The girl cannot leave w/t that toy and the toy was so many times washed and cleaned that they had to ask for a new one. After 30 min consideration the girl accepted the replacement and organized a birthday party for her favorite Dog."
4,Dry but informative.,"This is a must-have for singers and vocal teachers. I had to buy it in college for a class. Now as a teacher, I use the anatomical charts to show students and I re-read chapters based on my need. The only reason that it gets 4 starts and not 5 is that it is just so very dry. I think a new edition is in desperate need!"
1,Preposterous!,"The underlying theme in this pamphlet by Murray Rothbard of the Australian School of Economics, is that the Federal Resereve should be abolished and we should return to a gold standard.Clearly this so-called economist has overlooked two very important things...1. Without the Federal Reserve, how would Citi et al and JP Morgan et al make any money?2. What would stop the so called ""free market"" from being exploited by greedy miners who would inflate the production & supply of gold so quickly that we would experience hyperinflation and a complete breakdown of the currency?Verdict: Poorly thought out arguments Mr Rothbard."
2,Scent is too strong!!,I don't like this. Because the scent is awfully strong. I wish it could be more light scent!! I won't buy it anymore.
1,Cheapamania,I guess I shouldn't have expected much from this t shirt but come on this is bad. The shirt material is very thin and has a cheap feel. I'm sure after the first wash it will shrink and be unwearable. I wear an XL in most t shirts so that is what I ordered. When I put it on straight out of the package I felt like I had put on a size medium t shirt. Don't waste your time or money on this garbage item like I did.
4,Collecting Guide for the M1 Carbine,"As a novice, I found this book to be very helpful and instructive. There are folks with the M1 Carbine Club who have told me there are errors that have been discovered in this book, however. I don't know what they are and at this point, don't know enough about the carbine to challenge any of it. I understand the author, J. C. Harrison died in the past few years so there will probably not be a new edition. I recommend you add this to your rifle library if you are interested in historic military rifles."
2,Not Bad,"Its worth it for the price, but you better have other studying materials. Somewhat common sense, but good review."
3,Nice looking stock,"a lot of work just to get it to fit. Get a dremel,some sand paper and about 2 hours of free time."
1,Bad Reviews Are True,I bought this knowing there was a chance it wouldnt fit. I was ecstatic when it fit perfect in the stock BUT THEN i tried loading my 91/30 and it wouldnt load. So i took it out of the stock and tried loading it and it worked fine so my conclusion was that the stock was actually stopping my extractor or whatever u call it from budging thus making it impossible to push the round down into the clip. So about two hours and alot of youtube later i finally had sanded out enough of the stock to where it would uncomfortably load the clip still needs more work. DO NOT RECOMMEND. Waste of money due to much extra effort. Ive never bought a more annoying accessory for any of my guns.
4,Awesome stock!,"First off, after reading mixed reviews about this stock, i decided to risk it and click buy. I didnt regret that decision. I never faced any problem dropping the upper receiver right in so i'm not very sure what the deal is about having to work on it.Shot it and I can say i love it. It feels way better shooting with this stock than the original wooden PLUS steel buttplate. Highly recommended if your want to tame the recoil. Would also recommend adding the gel-pad thingie on sale on amazon too. Shoots well, shoots great."
2,Needs significant modifications to work properly,"It looks real good. However, it does not work without a good bit of carving and shaving. I can't say if this particular one was deffective, but the mag won't feed with this stock due to lack of clearance blocking the little metal lip from retracting and allowing the rounds to pop up.If I had to do it again, I would bave kept the gun with the original wood stock and saved the time and money.. 2 stars for the great look only."
1,Mosin Nagant replacement stock,"Looked good in the box. Fit and finish are poor. I have an M-44, M-38, and three M-91/30, none of which fit the stock very well. I have routed about an eighth of an inch of plastic out of the stock and so far still can't get a fit that is good. Very disapointed."
3,projet piece,ok lets start with the good. once you get this stock on it looks great and feels awesome. it lightens up the rifle and makes a great replacment for the heavy blocky original stock.now for the bad or just annouying. i have a 1935 91/30 with a hex head receiver and it did drop in first shot but very very tightly. i delt with the tightness until i tried to feed a round into the magazine and found the stock pushed so tight the ejector couldnt move to allow feed and much much much filing was needed
4,Mosin Nagant stock,Great stock for the money. I didn't give it a 5 star rating because I needed to sand down the parting line of the mold joints. Overall a great buy. Thanks much.
1,Terrible Service-Incomplete Product,"Received item on time (although they sent it to the wrong address and had to pick it up at UPS). All accessories including buttpad and screws were missing. Tried to contact seller, and they did not reply. Had to file claim. Would not recommend this seller."
1,Horrible,"This stock was absolutely terrible. I bought this stock even after reading all the bad reviews out of hope that I would be one of the lucky ones. Not the case...after spending over an hour filing to get the barrel to set SOMEWHAT down in the stock, I realized that the stock is warped significantly to the right. If you buy one of these stocks, it really is a crap shoot from everything I've read."
3,took a lot of sanding,It took a lot of sanding to get everything in the right way. Also this stock is rough around the seems.
5,2nd one I've bought,"I've bought 2 of these stock. 1st fit very well, 2nd required 5 mins of fitting. Stock looks good and is great deal for the money. Makes the Mosin look like a whole different gun, I also drilled and tapped it for ati scope base, and found a guy on eBay that welded new bolt handle and safety ring on the rifle. After hot blueing every steel part my buddy had to have it, so I had to build another. Good deer rifle for around $180 if you access to blueing and machine work like I do."
3,Badge holder,"I was very disappointed that the badge I ordered didn't fit the holder. I ordered the same exact badge as pictured, but the holes for the pin to go in were to far apart and the badge couldn't close on the holder. Other than that it is a nice well made holder, just can't find a badge that would fit it."
3,Not so comfortable,"I bought these thinking they were a splurge for a nice spring sneaker to wear with capris. They are very different, which I like. They seem to be nicely made with quality materials, but they are not as comfortable as I thought they'd be. The mesh material doesn't break in as softly as I thought it would, and the back inside of the heel is really stiff. I made the mistake of wearing them without socks once and I got a bad blister on my heel. Like the look but don't like the lack of comfort."
1,Nothing to do with Horses,Having read as much about the dvd as was available I looked forward to watching it--great dissappointment!! It was for Architectural Students NOT a grand tour of Americas finest stables and equestrian facilities as I expected but a rather dry presentation of the houses and their history with rather tenuous links to the horse world.
3,"Poor rating because of the seller, not the product.","Ok, Clorox wipes... there's not much I can say about them. We've all used cleaning wipes. And Clorox is no different well, better than some of those cheap brands that tear easily)I do want to warn you about this seller... (not Amazon.com) They shiiped me just one container, not 12. And refused to put the remaining on a backorder because of the low low price (I suspect... as I got the 12 pack for $10). Amazon made sure I got my money back immediately.Avoid purchasing this product from this particular seller."
5,Freakin' Franklin Is Friggin' Fun!,"What can I say, I play it for hours after my kid goes to sleep. Man...I dig that school play stuff. Its so crazy, it make me want to laugh some more! =)MORE! MORE! MORE!"
1,"BUILDER SAYS ""NO"" TO THIS BOOK...","DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!! Measuring only 5.25"" x 8.5"", ALL DRAWINGS ARE REDUCED TO FIT. THE REPRO IS BELOW NEWSPRINT85 LPI QUALITY MAKING THE PRINT AND DRAWINGS ILLEGIBLE. A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY, EVEN AT THE USED PRICE OF $6.00! SHAMEFUL. IF I COULD RATE LOWER THAN ONE STAR I WOULD."
1,Agree with first review,Fortunately I was able to find this in the local library before buying it. The illustrations are unreadable. WAY too small! Find something else.
3,Needs More Detail,"There are a few problems with this book, it does not go into enough detail on the topics to really be 100% useful. It relies too much on App Wizard code and fails to explain the object orientation of VC++ this book is not for a person that has never looked at VC++ before."
2,Very disappointing,"As told before, this book relies too much in the AppWizard, and does not give you enough information about MFC programming. Unless you already know something about windows programming, you should go and see for another book."
4,Overall it becomes what every EI user expects,"It's been a while now since I stoped trying to get EI oriented magazines to provide me with the knowledge needed to solve the get-arounds in EI...by far the most complete 3D package in the professional animation world. it is NOT for begginers tho, a vast animation and EI terminology is to be acquired before even considering taking the plunge on the advanced stuff in this book (which is the main benefit)...I'd say, if you've done a couple of things in EI, and have done past work over other minor apps...then by all means get this babe."
3,Good music for work,"I bought this to add to my collection of instrumental easy listening music ""elevator music"" for listening to while I am at work. The music helps me concentrate better on my work. I like this album all the songs sound pretty much the same light plinky music. I will probably purchase more Porter music box music."
3,Smallest Pot No Good with Samsung Induction Range,One pot is too small to use with my new Samsung induction range because it is much smaller than the smallest burner. Induction doesn't work if pot/pan doesn't fit all or most of the burner.
4,"Daily use, no issues.","So far we are really happy with this set. We use them on a daily bases, and we wash them in the dishwasher. We have no complaints. We did read all the reviews about leaking. We decided to buy them anyways. Ours do not leak."
5,Great cookware,This is solid heavy-duty cookware. These will last me for the rest of my life. These are just the right sizes for everything I cook. They are truly more than I hoped for.
5,Spongebob Squarepants Look and Finf,My son loves Spongebob so this book was his favorite! He loved finding all the silly things and read this book over and over.
1,These are not Vegan,"I have never eaten these, because well, they're not vegan. They are in amazon's vegan section however. Whey is not vegan it is the very first ingredient."
3,"Good, but not Great!","The manual for this weather forcaster is so small I have to read it with a magnifying glass. Due to the poor manual, you are almost required to go on the internet to get instructions.It tilts, but not enough to read. If it's on a desk, you have to pick it up to get a good read. The Barometer has an altitude adjustment but it only goes to about 3900 feet. I'm at 6,200 feet.However, it does it's job pretty well and the historical barometer is helpful. It's good looking and presents a lot of info at a glance. If you need barometer, two temps and time, I'd recommend it."
3,This has two great songs and the rest are boring...,This is not a good album by the band BUT is worth to buy it for TWO GREAT SONGS.LOVE ON THE LINE & PLAY TO THE WORLD are two of the best ever BJH songs and are here both of them. the rest songs are boring...
2,This book doesn't deliver,"This is the off-beat story of Esker, a 31 year old woman who, since her college years, has been haunted by a past relationship disappointment. The question of the story: will she allow a man to love her again? Interesting premise, but there are many problems with the way it was handled: the previous lover was so unloving it's difficult to empathize with the extreme loss Esker's felt in his absence; Esker offers so little in the way of emotional connection to the new man in her life, his continued affection for her doesn't make sense; the book never delivers anything in the way of character growth or change. Nothing happens here. She's unhappy in the beginning. She stays that way. A real disappointment. I got the sense the author was more interested in the way she used language than in what she was actually saying."
4,I loved this book,"THis book is delightful, refreshing, an engaging read with many layers. Cohen's metaphors, images and referene points made me smile, pause, reach for a highlighter. My only complaint was that it ended too soon."
2,Nostalgic but a little disappointing,"I gave this book as a gift, then read it and regretted. The commentary was knowledgeable but the stories tended to be very pulp-y and, to me, only interesting for historic or nostalgic value. Most readers' tastes will have evolved past most of these tales. The worst aren't really even stories, in the sense of plot or characters, but have the quality of bad Twilight Zone episodes based entirely on a single ""Wouldn't it be weird"" punchline.Sorry to be negative, but I was genuinely disappointed with at least half of the collection. Even the stories listed as good examples in the editorial review are mostly trivial and now cliche. For escapist time travel yarns, you might try Heinlein's ""The Door Into Summer"", Willis's ""Doomsday Book"" or ""To Say Nothing Of The Dog"", or (what the heck) Twain's ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court""."
5,one of the best books on training,"This books keeps trainers and training designers focused on their participants, and it makes all the difference in training results! A classical work."
2,Boring,Can't understand why this show was popular. The only good thing about it was Martin Sheen. Maybe I didn't give it enough of a chance. I only watched about five or six episodes. Couldn't take any more.
2,Worked great for three years and then started smoking from the 24 pdu outlets,It was a seriously bad morning when I entered my machine room to find the PDU-APC-AP7530 smoking from the pdu outlets with my expensive Avid audio equipment attached. The PDU-APC-AP7530 was purchased new three years ago and in pristine condition. I was shocked that minimal wear on this unit almost burnt my studio down.
3,Just OK Hot Plate,This little hot plate came with a very tilted burner. I can live with that but it will not stay at a consistant temp at all. It heats up nice then turns off & takes a very long time to get back up to the temp I need. Also takes a VERY LONG time to cool down for safe handleing after use. That might be common for this style of burner though. Pretty much a waste of time & money for me. I wouldn't buy this one again. But I do have an extra burner when needed for non critical cooking.
1,Died after 3 months,"I was so happy with this little burner. It did everything I needed it to do. Until I returned to school after winter break and found it dead, un-responsive, kaput! I tried it in every outlet in the building to no avail. It had been plugged into a surge protector with several other appliances that are all functioning. I would steer clear of this illusion of a good deal. Boo!!! Two-thumbs down."
1,Can't Boil An Egg,"Burner unable to keep heat steady at temperature selected because it appears to have an automatic temperature control that keeps turning the heat off. Because of that, it's impossible to boil an egg. The appliance's manual makes no mention of an automatic temperature control, so I don't know whether the appliance actually has this feature and the feature is interfering with boiling an egg or whether the appliance simply is defective no matter whether it has an automatic temperature control or not. Not only do I not recommend purchasing this appliance, but past experience with other burners has taught me not to buy a burner with automatic temperature control for this very reason. If this burner's description on Amazon had mentioned automatic temperature control, I never would have bought it in the first place."
2,Not a powerhouse,"Just a warning for anyone who intend to use this for Hot pot or Shabu.It's not hot enough.We tried to use it to have a hot pot dinner, but it failed miserably. It takes about 15 min to boil the pot, and took minutes to cook a single thin slice of lamb.Not very impressed."
1,Not worth buying,"I guess you get what you pay for. One day the unit just did not work anymore, only after a couple of months & not used but on the weekends while doing a kitchen remodel. Spend the money and purchase through a brick & mortar so you may return it easily if it just stops working."
1,Cannot get worse than this!,"This movie stunk on ice! In the list of all the movies, plays, novels, poems, etc. ever made this one falls at the very bottom! ""Waterworld"" would be one slot above it."
2,where is it ?,movie should have explained that turkish people are so brave n feels never fear of notin but its just a name to the movie n thats a shame
3,Classic For Graffiti,"Being a graffiti writer myself, I remember watching this movie when i was pretty young. Back then, I always thought people who wrote graffiti were vandals, or criminals, but this movie was one of the first to portray them in a possitive light. The lead character (Timothy Hutton) was made out to be the 'mysterious-hero' taking on city hall, getting his message out for all the city to see. Heroic, daring, all the reasons why i took on graffiti to begin with. This movie is also considered a cult classic to your common movie buffs, graffiti writers, and your underground New Yorker."
5,Amazing!,"This is the first stamping book I've ever purchased. I'm very happy with my purchase it and highly recommend it! For each project, she clearly explains how to accomplish it; as well as, providing very nice pictures throughout the book!!"
2,Ho Hum .....,"While the thoughts and ""wisdom"" provided are beautiful, they seem a bit cumbersome for every day referral. A quick one liner would be more suitable and more apt to remain with us throughout each day. These seem pretty wordy even though the thoughts are terrific and inspirational. The length makes it difficult to wrap your arms around them and keep them in your thoughts throughout the whole day. The pictures are lovely but the whole ""feel"" of the book is not inviting to and welcoming to pick up and open to any page .... soft cover might be more conducive."
2,Not Quite Great,"I have read nearly every book that has won the Newbery Award (not just Harry Potter, but the classics of children's literature). Some are tough to read because they no longer speak to our time. Others, like M.C. Higgins the Great, are tough by their inherent dullness. This book is the darling of high-brow critics. The plot goes nowhere. The setting is alien without the explanations that make alien settings understandable.The book earns two stars for decently developed characters and unique point of view.For stories that deal with the struggles of growing up, read ""Onion John"", ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", or ""The Midwife's Aprentice"" instead of this critically acclaimed dud."
1,yuck,"this is quite pssibly the worst book i have read. i could not get into the book, much less past the first chapter. the book had no readon to keep reading and what i did read was not cumminicated well and was difficult for me, and advanced reader, to understand."
2,Worked fine for a while,"Worked fine for about a year, then just started acting funny, made lots of noises (technical speak for us not techies). Luckily I backed it up to the hard drive (we had been using it as a shared drive). Now back to the drawing board. Maybe a different manufacturer this time."
5,This External hard Drive is reallu good,This external hard drive is very versatile and usefull i like when i shutdown my notebook and the hard drive shutdown automatic.
3,Decent but not great,"This Album is really a great idea but unfortunately it falls a little short of what it sounds like. His playing obviously is not going to be great seeing as it is country blues but even so there are too many so songs that sound exactly the same. This is a good and a bad thing because there are some bad songs and good songs that have a similar counter part. This being addressed, it makes one wonder why there are 13 tracks on this album when there should be only about 9 or 10. When I see the number 12 and above in track numbers it is usually because there are fillers that are sub-par and only there to fill up space, which was evident in some of the songs. Overall it is an ok album but a little too generic even for the blues. John Lee Hooker has much better stuff than this so it is definitely missable unless you are looking to complete your John Lee Hooker collection."
2,"""Professional"" - Not Really","This was intended to separate a common front lawn, to provide a barrier to encroaching crabgrass from the neighbor's yard. I liked the idea of a single piece of edging, without having to use shorter lengths. Big mistake! There is no way this is 'professional' by any stretch of the imagination. The material is thin plastic that is impossible to keep in a straight line when placed in the small trench needed to position the edging. Perhaps it would work in a serpentine form, which is what it ended up doing anyway. Several attempts were made to get the material perfectly straight, but it was impossible. The descriptions by the manufacturer make it difficult to determine the specifications of the product. My suggestion is to go to Home Depot or Lowe's, in order to touch and feel the product and determine if it meets your needs."
5,Simply perfect!,"This is quite a helpful and information guide on the look of the movie trilogy for the new age "" Lord of the Rings"".Here in this book, you will see information on the five years that Peter Jackson took to bring J.R.R. Tolkein's masterpiece onto the Big screen and the effort was worth the wait. This tells you about the make-up effects, special effects, actors, and premiers on the two films and a very helpful book if you wanna know about the movies."
1,The Harriett Lane Handbooks,"More stars may be rated, I don't know. I can not tell anything about this book. I have heard of the series, but need more information.I can not tell when this book was written. I must be able to look through the table of contents and flip through a couple pages using a search. I search to see if the book contains relevant materials (standards and/or procedures that would assist me in my profession).I never buy a book, I can't checkout ,at least, with the table of contents.Respectfully,Effie Pittman"
2,Product does not perform as expected,Product does not perform as expected. The cable length allowed for use is small and therefore provides little to no value in identifying cable run. The audio alarm is a faint sound that is only detectable if placing device next to your ear. I would never recommend this device.
2,Very Basic,If you are looking for a first cheer DVD this would be it. We found it repetitive and felt it had way too much talking.
5,A book of gracious living,"After I saw the ""Mad Magician"" when I was 14, I became a Vincent Price fan forever. What a wonderful surprise to discover that he also loved art and cooking! I saw him lecture on art at the University of Kentucky and read his book ""I Like What I Know."" I was thrilled to buy his cookbook in the late 60's--it has remained one of my most prized possessions. The recipes are just the best, but the real wonderment for me was to see the beautiful full page color plates of his house and his extensive collection of plates, glasses, pots, pans, etc. All sorts of things I had never heard of at the time. Just wonder-full. So not only did I enjoy your movies and cooking expertise, I felt that I shared in a part of your life, too. Thank you and God bless you, Vincent!"
2,not like duct tape,"I purchased this item to hold my carport sections together, only time will tell weather I'm satisfied or not? more resembles bandage adhesive tape although a bit stretchy. Definitely not the usual duct tape.08-11 this stuff is great, superior to duct tape so far! Still clean white and holding."
1,A don't buy,This was not a good book. I found it very difficult tounderstand and learn from. It is the required text for a class I'min. I am currently looking around Amazon.com for a text to replace it. Save money. Buy something else.
4,Very helpful,"Using this book in conjunction with another is very helpful. For me, a visual learner, this practically illustrates what another book on theory is talking about!!"
1,EVIDENCE-Grasping at straws,"I haven't managed to watch all of this DVD yet (I've tried twice) and it's for the simple reason that it's boring, is poorly made, lacks any interesting footage and is full of what could politely be called ""Fuzzy Logic"".David Sereda spends a great deal of time trying to convince us we're really seeing something of consequence, when I'm confident it's just a video anomaly. Something to do with a camera having a great deal of trouble focusing in very low light. I've worked in film and Television for over 20yrs.I think this DVD's a waste of money. There are some far superior vids and DVDs out there, one of the best being ""Out of the Blue- The definitive investigation of the UFO phenomenon"". I swing from being a believer in UFO's (Not nescesarily little green/grey men) to disbelief, this DVD pushes me towards disbelief."
5,irrefutable proof!,Hi I just had to include my 2 cents about this masterpiece. I have seen this video 3 times already and still find it facinating. It truley leaves you breathless. Don't listen to the ignorant reviewers who found it either hilarius or were so stupid that they deluded themselves into thinking that pulsating objects with a very obvious structure could possibly be dust. David Sereda has done a fantastic job explaining the science and facts behind what you are able to observe in the video. A top notch effort!
2,Disappointed,"This book has lots of tips, however, it is a disappointment. I have been practicing many of these tips for a long time, so there's not much that is new. Some tips are repeated, some are common sense and others are not practical. I bought this book used and feel I still spent too much, definitely not worth $12.95."
5,everyday cheapskate tips,the book gives you cheapskate tips on everyday items that you use in the housemakes life style toward saving money
5,Total awesome!,"Laughed my butt off. Very funny and can't wait for his next comedy album, very funny fluffy guy from another big man"
5,FUNNIEST EVER,"Hot an Fluffy, is a must see. the funniest stand-up I have ever seen. i can't beleiive this guy makes up his own skits. This DVD made me laugh so hard I had stomach aches after. this is better than the comedy central stand-up that this guys did."
5,FLUFFY and FABULOUSLY FUNNY!!!,"(I have a feeling all reviews for this DVD is going to have at least one ""fluffy"" reference...)Gabriel Iglesias is absolutely hysterical on this DVD! His CD Pikachu I See You is great and his Comedy Central appearances are always terrific and this DVD is no exception. His stories, his voices & impressions and just generally outrageous and still totally adorable delivery makes this DVD a MUST HAVE for anyone who likes to laugh!!!"
2,Fluff Not Enough,"Not my cup of tea, but it may be yours. I've had my fill of fat guy jokes, sound effects and funny voices...and my pesos would go toward George Lopez who seems to have come into his own.Gabe is a sweet guy and it ain't easy out there in comedyland so props for 'making it.' I just wasn't smellin' what he was cookin' for his big show in Bakersfield. Then again, I love Bill Hicks!"
3,Pretty funny,I thought Gabriel was pretty funny with his hawaiian shirts and all. He keeps it family friendly
2,No Lyrics,"Unfortunately, I was very disappointed to find that the book does not have lyrics inside of it. It has all the music, but it doesn't have the words to the songs printed with the music."
3,The Gigabytes Don't Add Up!,"If you like having the wool pulled over your eyes, don't pay attention to the big sticker on the packaging that says '320 GB'. It's not. It's 298 GB. After looking around the WD site a little, their footnote in listing it's supposed 320 GB capacity is this:""This capacity is reported using the decimal numbering system (1 MB = 1,000,000 bytes and 1 GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes). Both Windows and Macintosh operating systems use the binary numbering system, which results in a lower reported capacity"".In my eyes this is just short of false advertising. I'll take mine back. Not sure how the other hard drive manufacturers do it but I feel swindled. Other than that, it's a nice little box, very quiet and attractive. But not 320 GB."
4,An Essential Reference Tool,"I bought these books as a further tool for quick reference to the Church Fathers. The only problem is that they are arranged chronologically rather than topically. There is a theological index in the back but it is, in my opinion, sorely lacking. The first topic I wanted to look up wasn't listed (I don't remember now what it was).That said this is still an important work for those interested in the Church Fathers or early Christianity. Another resource I would recommend, though not without it's own biases, is David Bercot'sDictionary of Early Christian Beliefs. It is arranged topically, but only deals with the Ante Nicene period. It does unfortunately leave out a few key verses on topics the author does not agree with (intercession of the saints etc.).Ultimately no one resource will meet all the needs of the reader, and the best thing yet is to read the writings of the Church Fathers for yourself. Though labour intensive it is."
3,"Ok, but watch out for problems.","This is a nice introduction to HTML. It is really fun to read, and gives you alot of information on HTML. But the CD rom in the back only works on Windows 95, not on 3.1 as the book states. And the mailing list and the author's web page don't exist, do you really want to trust your money to someone like that."
5,About Grainian,Hey~I have been following Grainian with my brother since they first started. My first concert was a Grainian concert @ the High school where my brother was going. I LOVE Grainian...they are the best....i make all my friends listen to them whenever they are over. I would definitly recommend this CD and all of their CD's to anyone who loves music~
5,Excellent Coffee Maker,This item is used in my office for all of the coffee drinkers. It is working flawlessly and meet our space saving needs because it is flush against the wall. I would recommend this product to other consumers!
1,Birdemic=shock and terror?,"I love really bad movies. Troll 2, Thankskilling, Broken Springs...terrible horror movies are kind of my forte. When I saw the trailer for Birdemic on Netflix (and that it received 3 stars) I thought it looked perfect.Unfortunately, Birdemic is not a movie that is so bad it's funny. It's a movie that is so bad it is way past the point of being funny. It's really just sad. The first third of the movie is backstory on the characters and is painfully boring; the acting is some of the worst I have ever seen; the ""story"" makes no sense at all; and the editing might be the worst editing any movie has had ever, in the whole history of filmmaking.God, this movie is bad."
5,Birdemic: Indie Filmmaking Gem or Poisoned Candy Necklace?,"It may be a bit of both.But what is life without a little danger?This genre mash-up combines the terror of fighting off multiple unexplained bird attacks with the horrors of falling in love. Digital Gunshots ensue. Not only is this a ""must-see"" for cult movie fans, it is a ""must show"".Amazing."
5,ALAN BAGH IS GREAT THE NEXT BIG STAR!!,ALAN BAGH HAS WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A BIG STAR ALAN IS A GOOD GUY AND IVE KNOW HIM FOR YEARS YEAH THE MOVIE WAS WACKY SO WHAT I LIKED IT ANY WAY IT HAD SOME THING ABOUT IT THAT REMINDED ME OF OLDER FILMS WITH A MODERN TWIST YES I AM TYPEING IN ALL CAPS CUS IM YELLING AT YOU!
4,Must reading,"This book offers a fascinating glimpse of the Holocaust seen through the eyes of a young girl. It's not a dreary catalogue of horrifying events and torment. Instead, it gives a fresh, detailed account of how a family tried to stay together and how one very brave girl managed to survive in a terrible time.The author's description of her narrow escapes and 500 mile journey after being liberated from the camps will keep you reading to the amazing and uplifting conclusion."
4,Potholes to Paradise - a useful resourse,Tessa's book is a valuable guide for anyone considering living in Costa Rica. It is very easy to read and contains valuable information and facts about the country as well as interesting stories of the Borner's experiences and those of their friends. Tessa will save you time and trouble if you follow her advise. She has done the work for you!
4,More web less game,"I'm new to java and some web design. This book was pretty good, if your building a game for online. But not so good in reference to online web design. I did like it however just a pain in the rear trying to figure out were the code goes in my xhtml/css. But it also could just be me being a little behind the ball."
2,Poor on example (relate only with games),"I have read this book for a long time (may be 2 years a go) but I did not complete it until now. The book is very boring, Because I'm never learn javascript, that is why it is the reason that i choose this book. But all of the book example is explain with the game project. I really hate it. What I expect to learn is the benefit of javascript scripting language that I could use in the business website. I expect to have a real example for business web site development using javascript scripting language, but this book is totally nothing. If you want to learn javascript for using in business, don't buy this book."
4,I use this to seed jalapeno peppers,"I purchased one of these a number of years ago at my local grocery. After many years of use on apples and jalapeno peppers, the attachment of the blade to the handle failed. I like to use jalapeno peppers for cooking, but they spoil quickly, so I like to seed them and freeze them to use as needed.I went back to the grocery store to get another one and they didn't carry it anymore. I've looked at almost every grocery store in town as well as some kitchen specialty shops for this handy item. I finally thought to look on amazon.com and found another one in minutes after shopping around town for a few years.Thanks amazon.com! Next time, I'll look here first."
2,too slippery to wear,I love Clark's brand shoes. However this are too slippery to wear with hose. Not that easy to walk in. I am use to Clark's Sunbeat's ...they can't be beat they are truly 5 star shoes.
1,I THINK THIS SWING IS SOMEWHAT TERRIBLY DESIGNED,"I RECIEVED THIS SWING AS A GIFT FOR MY SON AND I THINK THEY DESIGNED IT TERRIBLY DUE TO THE BEARS ABOVE THE SWING, THEY SWING BEHIND THE BABIES HEAD SO THE BABY HAS TO ACTUALLY LOOK UP AND BEHIND HIM TO SEE THEM MOVING. WE JUST STARTED USING IT I WE HATE IT. DONT BUY THIS JUNK AND ALSO THE TRAY IS HARD TO GET OPEN AND A PAIN TO CLOSE YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS ALIGNED BEFORE IT CAN CLOSE. TAKE MY ADVICE DONT BUY!!THANKS FOR READING"
4,Puts the baby to sleep,"This swing is great!!!! It has 6 different speeds, however my son loved it on the fastest speed. The padding is pretty good on the swing. Easy to assemble.THe moblile however could be left out. It doesn't stay over the baby, it goes behind the baby head. Even when the seat is completely reclined. So it does not stay in place. I took it off our swing and the swing is perfect.The fabric is also very easy to take off and wash when you need to.After I am done feeding my baby, I out him in the swind and he will take a nap for hours. Also, the swing is lightweight, making it easy to move from room to room or even to the kitchen while cooking dinner.Overall this swing is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,I learned a lot of good tips to be a fantastic aunt.,"By this book, I thought a lot about my own perfect aunties(mother's sisters). What this book says have been really proved in my own life. Additionally, I decided to become a good aunt to my own neices and nephews."
3,"Excellent mission overview, but lacking in details","Very thorough coverage of the missions, and some tactical information. However I found that the strategy guide lacked the internal information that I expect to see in every guide of this type. Things like formulas, weapon specifics, explanation of some things not in the manual (game effects of a type B rack for example) and the most prominent missing item: full overviews of each race, their advantages and disadvantages, and possible strategies against enemies of other races. This overview, for those interested, can be found in SFB Module D2: Tournament Tactics. Although aimed towards the tournament ships, you will get a good idea of good playing techniques for each race."
2,HORRID,"I had waited almost two weeks to get this cd and was so excited. I popped it in the cd player and the first song is GREAT. It's one that they had on their myspace page. BUT then, the rest of the cd turned to crap. It all went down hill. I barely have enough money to pay for my car and now I have waisted a few packs of cigarrettes on a cd I will only listen to for one...or possibly two songs. It is depressing... I have loved MSI for so long and I still support them, but I think they might be losing their unique style that I have grown so fond of."
5,im confused. not really,"I'd have to say it's material on par with FGWSSS. Meaning...? It's awesome, duh... that album is the best 57 or so minutes of my life every time I put it in a CD player. The only way FGWSSS is any better is simply because the length of the album. But, if you're truly an MSI fan you'll stfu and play FGWSSS and then this one, or vice versa. I mean... does the music ever get old? Doesn't too me... And in that case set this damn CD on repeat all day, whatever. Be happy with what you have, it's been a while sence MSI came out with a new album, you should thank god all that made you love them before is still here and now. Anyone who rates this album less than a 4 or 5 is just some lil cat in the middle of the road I need to run over. Def not a fan on MSI's music. Don't make me take out my rake and beat u wit it, it hurts."
4,Clean music can still be good!,"Yeah, it kinda loses it's kick without the bad words, but it's still a great CD by one of the best bands out there. It's funny listening to them censor things that I didn't even know were obscenities. I was a little pissed at first with MSI for making me buy two albums just for one bonus track and one video, but the CDs were only 10 bucks each. You can get both for about the same cost as one crappy pop album of your choice.And as for an actual review of the music, just look at the review of the un-cut version. It all applies, and the bonus track and video are great."
1,One Star Isn't Low Enoungh,Da Game of Life has to be one of the worst films ever made. Snoop Dogg who's a good actor wasted his talents in this bland Carlito's Way rip off. The cinematography is almost as nonexisent as the scirpt this film would be worse to watch then finding out your girl is cheating. Don't see this film please.
5,Great Product/Dvd Bundle,3 great movies all together. I couldn't have been happier to find this dvd set. Hope more sets like these are put together.
1,boring,"All they showed were Jews in ghettos which did not interest in the very least, poorly made film and would not recommend it or ever watch it again. Please don't waste your time with this rubbish. I would give this movie zero stars but I just did not have that option.Also: Aryan Poles suffered most under the hands of the Nazis who put them in death camps and they were the first to be exterminated at the gas chambers of Auschwitz. Why don't they show us the fate of the Polish Christians who suffered so much rather than the fate of the Jews who lived in Poland?"
3,Protects the table but the smell is awful!,"We bought this product to place under our usual table cloth. It's fairly thick and the size was fine plus the material looks water-resistant. But after two weeks of airing it out, it still has a very strong chemical odor associated with it and I'm planning to remove it. I'll probably end up using it as a water-proof cover for our outdoor furniture. I'm just not very comfortable about having any possible fumes from whatever treatment is on it near our food."
2,Worth buying only because cheap.,"I would still probably recomend someone to buy the book, but it's nothing special. Any of this information and more can be obtained on the internet from sites like 'www.duckcentral.com'. Many specific tips like putting pvc around your blind to keep beavers frow chewing on it. I hate when that happens. Anyway, buy the book, but don't expect much."
1,I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS A REAL GROUP,I was watching Halle Berry host SNL and they did a skit parodying an 80's group called Klymaxx. I thought it was just a joke but now to find out it was real makes it even funnier.
4,How easily life can change...,"I'm not sure how many adults read YA books, but I do and I have to say that Crank was a different read. The poetry format made a book about a serious, ugly subject -Crank- readable and at times beautiful.I hope that all teens read this just to see what can happen when you ""try"" any drug once--think snowball. I am not hip to the drugs that out there, but after reading Crank I now know this one is new and scary.As a parent, reading Crank doesn't provide any more parental pointers than I've heard before. I do know that as a parent I really have to be there for my kids. It's not easy growing up today."
4,Very compelling book,This book is well written and will hopefully serve as a deterrent to teens thinking about trying meth. It highlights the horrible experiences that go along with drug addiction.
5,"Great, Poetic book! not what I was expecting but it's very good!",This book is an eye opener. You see the transition of an 16 year old; from high school friends and achievement to being pulled in by the monster and giving birth to a child! This book is very good and I recommend it to all parents who want to let their children know what drugs really do to you. I'm 21 and it shocked me!
2,Heavy-Handed Message,"The book ""Crank"" has some good points: I liked the use of text layout in the shape of a cross when the character is praying, for example. However, the narrator's point of view is inauthentic. It does not sound like a teenage girl but a mother in many places in the story. It gets a little preachy due to how heavy-handed the messages is hammered home that meth is addictive. The portrayal of the Planned Parenthood clinic is completely wrong and feels like the author has an agenda, an ax to grind. I have worked with staff and volunteers at Planned Parenthood clinics, and the people who work there are very nice, non-judgemental people who really care about the women and girls they treat. They do not ""recommend"" abortion as the author says, but let you make up your own mind. This part of the book feels like a scare tactic, a polemic. The novel ""Go Ask Alice"" is much more authentic story about a girl and addiction. This novel, like any, is just one person's opinion."
2,suprised,"I recently recieved my copy of CRANK and was surprised to find it was all in poetry format. It was not what I expected. I went back and reread the description on amazon and realized that it did mention that it was free verse poetry about half way through, but it was easy to miss. Something that important should be the first thing they mention. It may be good poetry but if youre looking for a novel or autobiography this isn't going to cut it."
4,Crank Book Review,"Crank is a heart wrenching fictional book by Ellen Hopkins. Although it is a fictional novel the book is based on events that are similar to that of the author's daughter. This book gets you thinking about the choices you make when under the influence of drugs and shows the dark world of the drug industry. Crank is a page turner that will keep you entertained and curious until the very last page. The format of writing is different each page, and is written with a unique form of poetry. This allows a very fast read and introduces a new form of writing. This novel teaches good life lessons, and shows experiences any teenager can face. Crank is an amazing book although at times it can be hard to read. We would recommend this book to any kind of age group but specifically those who know about the world of drugs. This novel teaches you that life doesn't always end in Happily Ever After."
4,"Meet the monster, in your face!","When I first started reading this story I didn't like it... and then it grew on me.I wasn't sure what to expect out of a book written in perfect poetry.. and this was perfect poetry. the imagery that she created with those words on paper... I was caught up.. I felt like I had meet the monster myself.. But who was the monster really? I know the obvious but there were so many ways her life went wrong! Down the drain!Its the first time I ever wanted to read poetry.. (sometimes its so hard to understand)There was so much emotion in this story.. So many pick me up and drop me in ice cold water lines.This is a YA read that adults can get into and something I think all YA's should read. Let them see what playing with fire really looks like. I saw every bit of Bree's struggle, thrown in my face and it left me no choice but to feel it.I can't wait to read Glass(I can't believe i just said that)"
3,"great read, missing something important though.","I love this series and think everyone with a family should read at least once, especially since it is a quick read. My only gripe is with the kindle version. The physical books are written a few paragraphs to a page and in a poetic form, which you can see a glimpse of if you get about 30% through the sample.This version lacks that, and the ""hidden"" messages you read in the actual print copy. Read the sample to see if it is for you then buy the pphysical copy for the full effect."
1,Joe,I bought this saw from Amazon (re-seller) and was pleased with it for about an hour. The chain would not stay tight no matter what I did and no matter how many times I tightened it. Also it was not very powerful and I had a hard time cutting down some 8 inch in diameter trees. Not too easy to start either. Good news is the re-seller took the saw back for full credit. I would definitely look at for a different saw. Some folks obviously like this one but I had a terrible experience. Is it really worth the risk and the pain? Nope!
3,Good Finally,"I purchased the poulan pro 3516avx from Amazon.com. After it arrived I followed the instructions and tried to start it up. On the first pull the cord did not recoil! I called the ""HELP"" number on the saw and the told me to take it in for warranty service, although IT HAD NEVER BEEN STARTED! I called the support number directly at Poulan same answer NO SUPPORT! I called Amazon and they cheerfully shipped me a new saw IMMEDIATLY,(arrived in 3 days) and apoligized for the incovenience. Thank-you that was much better. New saw performs very well, No further problems, no thanks to Poulan."
1,Sends wrong message,"I was very disapointed in this book. My 4 years old likes it, but my husband and I both feel that it sends the wrong message and comes across that when you get angry you should run away. Can't believe this book won awards. There are much better books for children about dealing with anger and feelings...-If Your Angry and You Know It, by Cecily Kaiser.-When I Feel Angry, by Cornelia Maude Spelman.-Today I Feel Silly & Other Moods That Make My Day by Jamie Lee Curtis"
2,Eye candy; not stomach food,"Having eaten at Pierre Gannaire's reataurant in Paris on several occasions, I was eagerly looking forward to reading some of his extraordinary recipes and gaining some insight into his innovative techniques. While his food is a truly transporting experience, this book is not. The prose is good and the photography is beautiful, but alas, there are no recipes. I'm afraid that if you are looking for insights into his cooking, you will just have to go to Paris. I think that the absence of recipes should have been clearly stated in the editorial review. It is not a book to cook with, but to look at."
1,Does not include Audio Companion,"I assumed (incorrectly) that this was the same item as sold on the Rosetta website, but for 49.00 cheaper. It is not. It does not include the audio companion, which was one of the main reasons I purchased due to long commutes.I had to call Rosetta Stone (cannot order seperately on-line, must go through sales via phone) and paid $55.00 for it. I therefore spent more with Amazon, not less as they advertise (they are doing a price comparison with Rosetta Stone, but not comparing the same products!) and had to wait several weeks and go through a lot of trouble just to get what I could have gotten for less with an actual guarantee through the website. Don't buy from Amazon - go through Rosetta Stone!"
1,"Anticipated title, but disappointing","I returned this book to the seller. I have four Pionus parrots and was eagerly awaiting a book on them that would provide someinformation to the average bird owner. Instead, it is noninformative for the average owner. Very disappointing. Very little practical information on how to care for them, their traits or food preferences. Simply not interesting to the owner of these dear Parrots. Perhaps of interest to a person who is employed in the field--scientific concentration. Very expensive, yet very slim book."
2,I'll be diplomatic,"I will be diplomatic about this book as it appears there is a huge division between the lovers and the haters of it. I will say that I found the premise exciting, I liked the magic in it, but I found it rather bland. I didn't get a feeling of excitement. It seemed all so proper. I waited for Niclas (and I found the spelling of his name rather annoying) to really jump out at me and he never did. Neither did Julia. There were other characters I thought could have their own books, but if the next one isn't more riveting, I doubt I will bother with any more."
5,The simplest ideas with the best results!,Being in the fitness business has many rewards as well as many challenges to meet. Most of us learned the ins and outs of this business the hard way. Thomas Plummer pulls no punches! He is truly a man who knows his stuff. My staff and I have used many of his techniques with great results. I recommend this book to anyone who sees themselves being a success well into the future.
5,Very pleased.,Product was sent as a gift and the receiver was very pleased with it. Also was received in a timely manner. I do almost all of my ordering through Amazon because I get the best prices and never have any hassels.
2,"Who really wrote this secret ""Russian textbook""? Surprise!","This booklet only gets 2 stars. Why? Because Kenneth Goff neglected to notice, and change, all the Dianetic and Scientology lingo that L. Ron Hubbard put there in 1955. Do a google search. The booklet was written by Hubbard in 1955 as a propaganda pamphlet to smear psychiatry. It was anonymous, and not copyrighted. The original ""Editorial Note"" was by ""Charles Stickley,"" ie. Hubbard. See Hubbard's 1955 Scientology writings. And check out the Introduction of the ""Australian League of Rights"" version. Since there's no copyright, the booklet is still being rewritten, and rewritten. May be they can get all the Scientology lingo out by the tenth revision!"
5,Jujitsu for Christ To Be Reprinted!,"That's right. Now that Jack Butler has completed his fifth novel, THE ILLUMINATION OF ELIJAH LEE ROSWELL, his great and classic Southern novel JUJITSU FOR CHRIST is going to be reprinted! I don't know if it's going to be this year or next year but it will finally be available again, as it should always have been. We'll now have two reasons to celebrate."
5,Excellent resource for teaching and research,"Great stuff. McIver neatly reviews anti-evolution (in the broadest sense) before and after Darwin. Thought provoking in that is shows the mental tricks critics will turn to avoid contradicting the Genesis account and agreeing with Darwin.It's a shame the revised edition wasn't updated. Still, highly useful.As an aside, it's highly unlikely that the comment above attributed to McIver is true. McIver comes across as one who _always_ belived in evolution (see, for example, his articles in ""Creation/Evolution"" and ""Skeptic"") ... methinks I smell a hoax."
1,Very Disappointing,"The fun potential for these toys is astronomical. Unfortunately, that is only potential. Sad to say these toys are pure crap. Sure, you shake them up and they go, but only for a few feet. If you can get more than 10 feet out of it you are doing well. We have bought the race track and a few other cars and they all disappoint. You might get 2-3 laps on the track but with the car's short running time, there is a little hope of having them crash. My 2 year old loves the cars, but when we try to run them across the room they stop after a few short feet; no matter how much or how little you shake them. This is a very disappointing product."
3,September 12th,Book was actually in fair to poor condition. Definately not good- but the price was right so I can't complain.
5,Pleasantly surprized ~ Nice and Easy Mopping System!,"After reading several reviews on different types of on-the-handle spray mops, I ran across this one at a good price. We have floors that have to have one type of cleaner or our warranty will be voided so this mop allowed me to use my cleaner in the bottle provided. And, the pads are great either as disposables or if you want to wash them yourself, you can use microfiber wash/dish cloths. I have the small Swiffer (not the wet jet) but the handle is so wobbly. This one seems much stronger although it may not be long term because the base connection that snaps into the handle IS made of plastic. Still, for the price, I am VERY pleased with this spray mop. I smiled as I mopped this time and actually enjoyed the task."
3,"Not a very large ""LARGE""",Very nice quality slide. Be aware that the large is smaller than expected. Feels much closer to a medium when compared to my other slides.
1,You Lose,"The basic information which he outlines is good,but somewhat outdated.His ""system"" for winning flat out doesn't work. I tried it for two weeks. I tried it on different games, different casinos,no,the losses out numbered the wins.It isn't that difficult to learn so its not like I wasn't doing it right.This book is a little dated so maybe the casinos changed their programs since he published. I don't know,but bottom line you can not come out ahead using his system,believe I wish you could."
3,Worry free Internet gambling,"This book will allay any fears you may have about gambling with online casinos. There are many safeguards which are in place to insure a fair gamble for your money. There are hundreds of these internet casinos to choose from, and they are all competing for your business. There is at least one site that pays 9 to 1 on the tie bet in Baccarat. This bet always pays 8 to 1 at any land based casino. If you have discipline in your betting, you can have some fun with these internet sites and perhaps you can make money. The author goes into some of his doubling routines when his bets are losing. I don't like these types of bets. My nerves can't handle it. Aside from his betting techniques, there is some good information here."
3,Not what I expected,"It was okay, but it did not take two authors to explore one principle. I continued to read because it was difficult to believe that was it! It could have been said in two pages. I'm being way too generous: a paragraph.Why 3 stars? 2 stars for putting the principle out there and one out of generosity."
1,wrong region,I was really sad to see that I was shipped a product which will not work in my region.The DVD is fit to work in region 1 only where as in India it is region 5.Quiet surprising that Amazon still shipped it to me!
5,More than just for healthcare professionals,"Well written, easy to understand, this book is useful for other fields outside of healthcare. Any employer who deals with aggression will find this book to be extremely valuable. Excellent handbook for retailers who deal with shoplifers. Highly recommend."
4,Good idea.,I got this as a gift for a dog-lover family member. It is a great idea to give them the option to bake their own dog biscuits.
2,Low Quality Item,"The item looked quite nice online, but is quite a rough piece in person.I wrote a previous review for my experience and the seller called to beg me to delete it. The seller agreed it was a low quality product but stated that it should be expected to be for the price."
1,In God's name throw it away,"Anyone who would market this is working on behalf of Satan. I see people write how cool, this is awsome........So nieve..You want something cool, pray to God, He is the only power.That is the only real true Spirit you can speak to. The spirits that come through on the Ouija are not of Heaven, they are from the Devil's legion. For the ones that say nothing has happened, throw it in the trash and thank God that the power of God is watching over you."
3,Fun Game,"This is a very fun game, especially on a night with thunderstorms. You just have to remember it is a game and don't take it seriously. Just have fun with your friends."
3,If you really want a Spirit Board of Substance,"Bob's work is a fantastic alternative to the Parker Brothers Black & Brown mass-produced spirit board set, however if you want a real top of the line wooden board look to Portals To The Beyond.com they make boards of wood like those of the early 1900's but in full color with wild themes like; ""Charmed Triquetra"", ""The Crone Star Theban Witch"", ""The Voodoo Tiki"" and Kipling West Halloween designs. There is no better."
5,great product good price,good product good price i recomend this produce for all kinds of uses it even workes to insalate wire and sealing coragated plistic sheeting can be used for a lot of projects
2,the taste really is lacking here,"I do agree that the quality is nothing to sneeze at. These fill me up, I know that they're pretty good for you, and I like the nutty essence too. I guess that I really was disappointed in the taste, though. The chocolate was slightly bitter-tasting, and took me by surprise. I love the other flavors, but this one is my leat favorite. I would recommend the almond butter balls before this one, they're soft and a little more on the sweet side."
1,A waste of Money,Like the last reviewer...I thought the shampoo smelled good and it promised great volume. I could tell no difference in my straight hair. I was better off spending money on Garnier volume shampoo. Cheaper and better results!
4,a reflection of a teen's life,"It was interesting to read ""Catcher in the Rye"" because somewhere in the story I found myself as Holden or it reminded me of people that were like Holden, Ackley etc. The story was well written in the sense that it kept you in suspense of what Holden's other move would be. Whether he would go to the bar to get drunk or would secretly visit his little sister. The story also reflects one's opinion about the society Holden is living in. A place where a wide range of social unrest exists that cannot be handled by a 16 year old. The main theme of the story revolves around Holden's life, which at times is carelessness, negative attitude, romance and softness. Lastly one can learn from this story as to avoid ignorance and carelessness in life, which if followed will leave to an ending similar to as Holden's."
2,museum gel review,"Frankly, I am disappointed in this product. Before purchasing it and after reading the review that accompanied it on Amazon, I bought it for a specific use and after receiving it, the directions inside the box said it could possible stain certain surfaces, which means I can`t use it for the reason I bought it. The review on Amazon said it would not hurt any furniture surface, Which is it?"
1,do not buy,do not buy this product - it was old and just the smell made me sick - it was moldy looking too -- this is not fresh -- be careful.
1,Don't Buy unless you enjoy torture,This product has got to be the winner of worst design of the decade. The motor is the only good thing about it. Not even worth the detail. Just spend the extra for the better brand and don't look back.
2,Disappointed,My fiance bought this for Christmas for us & I was expecting better quality. It has glue spots and scratch marks on the wood. Very unprofessional. If you are looking for a temporary I'm sure it would be fine. However for someone who wants a nice looking coffee table do not buy this one. Poor quality and not impressive at all.
4,Small coffee table,"The coffee table was as described. The size was perfect for the designated area. The only fault I found (though not critical) was the color. In the ad the color was indicated as ""antique walnut."" I expected a warm brown; the color is more ""cherry"" than ""walnut."""
4,Nice product.,I got this product and the hardware was missing from the product. I called customer service and they sent me a new table with hardware in about two days. All I had to do was send back the first table within 30 days. The table is a beautiful color. It's a smaller coffee table so it is perfect for a small space. It's also very sturdy. Amazon's customer service is worth buying anything from their site.
1,Dirty Little Secret or Beats Me,"I would have given the Excalibur FN10-BB Wind Blaster a 5-Star rating, and I'm willing to change my 1-Star if someone can tell me how they have taken it apart to clean it. Eventually, one must clean it."
4,Works,"I have two of them one of them just stop working, I asked for replacement and I get the new one and new fan works just fine.it gives you enough cooling, better then I expected, it might be not enough for desert camping. I am in CA and it is ok. It might stop suddenly so do not trust this machine."
4,Perfect Bracket,I've had these speaker brackets for several years now....and they've held up perfectly. They were easy to install and adjust. The quality was also very good. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to install satellite speakers.
4,Nice middle of the road meter,Nice meter for the average do it yourselfer. Easy to use and nice rubberized case. I couldn't justify buying a Fluke for my use. This one should last me for many years. The temperature probe seems to be quite inaccurate. That isn't something I use so it isn't a problem for me. That is the only reason this didn't get five stars.
5,A grateful teacher,"As a teacher of twenty years, I am constantly searching for new books that are multi-cultural as well as show a respect for all forms of life. I was thrilled to read this book and find an anticipatory set for many valuable lessons. This book provides a way for teachers to teach values in a fun and creative way. I certainly hope there will be a Pukukui doll made so it can sit in the classroom and serve as a reminder of good behavior!"
1,Didn't live up to my expectations,"A great idea, and I really liked the feel of the controller. Much superior to those provided with the console. However, after several weeks of trying to get it to work consistenly, I'm returning the product. Buttons would not register, controls were not sensitive enough, and beyond 6 feet it was very erratic. In the end I purchased an extension cable. Others have found the device to work well; but not for me. Keep your expectations reasonable, and consider purchasing an extension cable. btw...game being tesed the most with this device was GT3."
4,Great pad,"The pad works excelently, As well as if not better than any other pad on the market. Though the pad does lack a variety of colors which is offered with the regular MadCats pads."
5,Beautiful! Inspirational! Erasure!,"Probably one of erasures best works to date. The combonation of euphoric, dark, and love songs on this album make it a must have! The boys really did wonderful!"
3,Lack of Water,"This record has their single ""Lack of Water"" on it. For some unknown reason, the CD has a bunch of blank tracks on it after the first 10 or so songs. The last track on the disk is ""Lack of Water"". The description by Amazon doesn't even include this song in the list of tracks, probably because of the weird gimmicky blank track thing, but rest assured that the last song is their big single.The rest of the disk seems ok, but I bought it for the hit single. This was unavailable at iTunes the last time I looked, so I had to buy the entire CD. Not a bad price at a penny plus S&H;."
4,Awesome CD---must have for music lovers of ALL KINDS!!!,Music on this CD has a stlye similar to 7 Mary 3 combined with Edwin McCain. Tracks 2 and 27 have to be the best on it. YOU NEED THIS CD IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT ALREADY!
5,The man who painted women - Rafael pezzarro Guardiana,"John Sefton Newton is a genius writer. This is the first of his books I have read and was totally engrossed by the beautiful writing style and magnificent stories apon stories interwoven into this man's life. The story takes us through the mind of the old painter and the problems, trials and tribulations of his colourful life. It was with sadness that I finished the book, wanting to keep it going forever. Each area of this man's life could have been made into another book and it will take a lifetime to mull over what he had skillfully written. 5 STARS!!!!"
5,"God is the key ingredient in ""Club Sandwich.""","I have read all of Jess Moody's books. I think he has found his niche with ""Club Sandwich."" He is a superb spinner of stories! This is his best book to date, his personal Everest of human interest and insight. He dares to share himself with the reader in an audacious and attractive way that appeals to the voyeur in us that clamors for celebrity dope. Buy it, read it loan it, but get it back. Long summer afternoons are coming!"
1,"""NOT GOOD AT ALL""","DEAR AMAZON.COM,I JUST RECENTLY PURCHASE SLY& ROBBIE ''ROOTS OF DUB"" CD.PERSONALLY THIS CD DOES NOT WORTH THE MONEY I'VE PAID FOR IT.BECAUSE IT SAYS ROOTS OF DUB BUT,IT HAS HIPHOP,DANCE,AND REGGAE.I'M SORRY I'VE PURCHASED THIS CD BECAUSE IT DOES NOT LIVE UP TO THE TITLE. SLY AND ROBBIE EARLIER WORK TO ME ARE AND STILL ARE THE BEST.THERE ARE ONLY THREE TRACKS THAT I LIKE ON THIS CD WHICH ARE,""WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE"",(CLUB VERSION),""WE ARE AFRICA"",AND ""NOBODY'S BUSINESS""."
2,NICE KNIFE,"RECIVED THIS KNIFE AND IT IS FAIR, GOOD BUY FOR THE MONEY, BUT AFTER HAVING THE LARGER SIZER THAT I USE ALL THE TIME I BELIVE THE LARGER 7 INCH IS A BETTER BUY."
2,Can you say re-master?,"It sounds like it did when it came out, no better. The sound is flat. So if you don't want the cd just to have it, then I would download. Which is what I ended up doing for ""Lost Inside You,"" which wasn't on the cd anyway. If you have an equalizer maybe you can work with it. But I'm listening to ""Lost Inside You"" which I downloaded and it has 'body'. It all depends what you like: enhanced-v-original. I don't know either way, MCA is not treating One-Way fans fair. For the songs it had on it, it shouldn't of cost this much. I hope al, alicia and the rest are getting their fair share."
5,Awesome toy!,Loved the toy! And the price. It was THE hit at a 3 year old's birthday party. I am planning to order one for my 4 year old daughter. She loves it!
1,"2 out of 5 were dead, then 1 more died shortly thereafter","These are not well made at all. I bought multiple and 2 were dead out of the packages. Then another died. We had multiple versions, not just the Gator. Avoid."
3,Littlle Disappointed,I bought 2 Morphibians one Gator and one Shark. The only problem is the kids can NOT run them at the same time. That was the purpose of purchasing 2 different ones.
5,Kid Galaxy Morphibians Gator Radio Control Vehicle,This remote car is very tough and can stand up to any toddler and young child. I was nervous about the antenna but was not a problem at all.Would recommend to anyone with children 4-8 yrs of age. I did have tw
2,stopped in water,Its a fun toy but the moter stopped in water and the back is under water but its fun romping around in the snow but the tires colllect snow as it moves.
4,Great Little Toy,"I purchased this for my 5 YO niece for xmas and when she first opened it, she wasn't too impressed but once we got batteries in it (on top) she was all about her car! I liked that it wasn't too boyish lookin and easy to use. We had to try it in the bathtub and the water ability was a cool feature. They have a swimming pool she will be able to use this in. It is good for hand/eye coordination. Not good in the grass though. Good value for the price!"
