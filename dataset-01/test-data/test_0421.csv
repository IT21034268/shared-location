2,Lacking substance,I was disappointed that there was only one song on a cd I paid full price in obtaining.
4,A must see for coaches and athletes,"Released as an independent film it did not get the preview push as it ought to but it did receive excellent critic reviews during its short run in the theaters. I was excited to learn it would finally be released on DVD and ordered 2 copies immediately, one for a friend and one for myself. My friend and his family loved it as I thought they might and I'd recommend it to anyone."
1,Bad quality,The quality of this DVD is awful. Less than halfway through the movie the picture started to freeze every two minutes. Unfortunately we only got around to watching it several months after we had purchased it so we could not return it.
4,Great Sports Movie,Fast delivery. Item arrived as advertised. Sean Faris always plays this type of character very well. The movie had good depth and supporting characters.
5,Brilliant,"This movie is absolutely brilliant, and what an amazing story at that. True too. This movie actually makes me want to go out and play rugby for that man. Though this movie isn't all about rugby, it's about family, friendship, ethics, values, and being the real you. What's the purpose of doing stupid things and ruining your life? There is no purpose, when there is much better and honorable way to live out your life. Stay true to yourself, and don't become the person that your parents want to be...be yourself (though those two things may be the same.)"
5,A must read/see!!!,"I saw a production of this play and then read the book. Both mediums (stage and literature) work well at giving an impactful, novel and profound perspective to philosophy, religion and spirituality. If you can enjoy a story that challenges your perspective from different points of view- this is a book to read and a play to see."
3,"Interesting info, but lots of omissions.","There was some interesting stuff in here, but unfortunately a lot of omissions. Helpful for the items it discusses, but LOTS of generalities. Also, it really sweeps through too much history at once. And it focuses more on men's underwear than women's, which as a romance writer is a problem for me."
5,Loving Dawn Reno!,"What a pleasure to find a new voice in contemporary women's fiction! LOVING MARIE is fresh, stirring and memorable. Great hook, wonderful first-person voice, and real, believable characters with human flaws. By the end of the book, I ended up loving Marie too. This was a real button-pusher (the e-equivalent of a page-turner.) Looking to hear more from Dawn Reno! - Anne Carter, author of IN TOO DEEP"
3,"if it ain't broke, don't fix it","We've very much enjoyed our KitchenAid coffee maker but did finally break the carafe in the sink. When we reordered they had changed the cover to include a flip up lid on the spout...which causes the carafe to leak/dribble when we pour water into the maker or pour our coffee...we wish we'd saved the old lid. We were able to pop off the flip top for a open spout again...all is well I suppose KitchenAid was trying to improve things, but this is a case of leaving good enough alone"
1,Not a Catholic Book,"This is not a good orthodoxed Catholic Book. First, the resurrection is not part of the stations of the cross. It lists this as a fifteenth station. Hello, that's not a station. Also, the book says Mary was alarmed. That is WAY off base. Mary was never alarmed. Theologically, the reaction Mary had verses Elizabeeth's husband are totally different. This book had HUGE potential as the graphics are well done. If this book held true to the faith, it would be a good buy. Mary Joslin, please read your catechism and learn the Catholic faith. I guess I should write a theologically correct book. In fact, look up Piscitelli and Gortler. They have 5 books out currently, each under $7 that are faithful and accurate."
1,Awkward to hold,"They look sharp and reasonably well made, but due to the size and shape of the finger holes it isn't possible to hold them the way one would normally hold hair or moustache scissors."
4,Okay,"As prescription cycling sunglasses, these are great value. They're effective and dirt cheap compared to other prescription wrap-arounds.As general sunglasses with contacts or no prescription, don't bother. There are sunglasses that are more attractive (these are square and ugly to accommodate the prescription lens carrier) with better lenses."
3,"Seems fine, but made in Indonesia","Amazon description says made in USA, but the 6' cord I got was made in Indonesia. That's disappointing. I spent extra for this cord over other ones Amazon sells on the basis that it was made in the U.S."
5,"Heavy duty, yet flexible","I bought this to use with a small air compressor in my garage. Works great, the plug fits flat against the wall, and the cord, while heavy-duty, is flexible enough that it can be run neatly along the base of the wall."
4,Essential Recording,"This album's songs came to Paul from the same places they have always come. If you own at least one Beatles' record, you'll enjoy this one just as much. Like a good book it keeps you captivated with tight mood swings. It truly cooks. What an accomplishment by such a gifted artist. Tired of all the (...) that's being hailed as great then when you take a listen and you're like Huh? He's got (...) to make such a record. I'm sure Paul feels really strong about these song's and everyone else that worked with him on it. He worked with a new young band and sung and played bass just like he did with the Beatles'. Live with no bass overdubs. Look what's on the charts now and weep. Then go out and buy ""Driving Rain"". True arsistic intent is hard to find."
5,"IN ROCK AND ROLL, PAUL MCCARTNEY CAN STILL KICK(s)","This is the most Beatle-esque thing Sir Paul has done since, well, The Beatles. The final cut, ""Rinse the Raindrops"" and the bonus track, ""Freedom"" are worth the price alone. This guy is- what, 62 years old?- and still manages to sing like Little Richard at age 20! The drummer's name is given as Abe Laboriel, Jr., but with some of the fills he does, I'd swear that's a pseudonym for Ringo. (...)this is the best thing Paul's done since Tug of War. Buy it and listen to it often. You'll dig it. (P.S., The censors at Amazon.com are real (...). The full title of my review reads: In the World of Rock and Roll, Paul McCartney Can Still Kick Your (...)! Surely, boys and girls, you're not trying to make this a Disneyesque, G-rated websight? If you are, then you'll soon find you've lost a customer...)"
3,Half-Good,"McCartney has a curious habit: about 1/3 of the albums he has released since the demise of The Beatles are good for the first half. Usually, these ""half-good"" albums follow his best work. For instance, the stellar ""Band on the Run"" was followed by ""Venus and Mars,"" upon which the first half was really good, and the second side dragged. ""Tug of War,"" perhaps his best for pure songwriting, was followed by ""Pipes of Peace""--again, Side One good, Side Two, blandish. ""Driving Rain"" follows a run of excellent CDs, such as ""Flaming Pie"" and ""Run, Devil, Run,"" and does something I've never witnessed before for Macca: the first ""side"" has only a few songs worthy of McCartney's high standards, but starting with the rollicking rocker ""About You,"" things really explode, and every song is fresh and original, devoid of any fluff. So, if you're willing to buy a CD and enjoy half the songs, buy it. If not . . ."
5,Paul's Back,"One Excellent Album.His best work in years. The album really reminds me a lot of The Beatles.Buy this album, put the head phones on, listen to it and be happy!Thanks Paul. You truely are one of the greatest people ever to grace our planet."
3,Not enough memorable tunes,"After seeing Paul last night in ""Big D"", I realized two things: 1) Paul has written (or co-written) many of the greatest songs of the last 40 years. 2) Paul hasn't written a ""great"" album since his days with Wings. The problem here is that the songs just don't have the staying power of JET, YESTERDAY, MAYBE I'M AMAZED, BLACKBIRD and hundreds of others. It's not a truly bad album, just very average. When you hear the new tunes played right next to the classics, it's easier to dismiss them as weak. On their own, written by someone we didn't hold to such high standards, they'd be just fine. But, just fine won't do after the absolute pop perfection that Paul has been cranking out since 1963. Still, McCartney's got more skill and talent then almost any modern artist getting airplay today (see your local top 10 for proof of how lame music has gotten in 2002), and I still believe the man has got a few more classics to give us in the future."
5,Paul drives on,"The first thing I noticed about Driving Rain is Pauls bass playing, the man is just so innovative on the instrument. It's good to hear his bass more dominant in the mix, on so many of his albums the bass is buried so deep. Paul is rocking just listen to Lonely Road, Driving Rain, About You, and Rinse The Raindrops. He's also soulful check out Tiny Bubble, and Back In The Sunshine Again. Paul is the master of variety and this album won't let you down. The stand out track on the entire album is Your Loving Flame, a power ballad if there ever was one! It's been a long time since Paul wrote a ballad this strong, it deserves the full treatment (promotion, video, etc). Driving Rain finds Paul carrying on with his greatness, and Your Loving Flame is one of Pauls best, a definite McCartney classic!!"
3,More of a downpour,"Macca's latest effort has som nice bits in it (from a lover to a friend, magic) some awful parts (she's given up talking, rinse the raindrops, spinning on its axis) and a lot of mediocre songs. Given the time Paul took after the death of Linda to come up with a new album he could have done a lot better. Driving Rain cannot be compared with Paul's jewels in his crown (Press to Play, Band on the Run, Ram and Back to the Egg). To give Paul credit DR is some respects quite innovative. But unlike Press to Play (joint effort with Eric Steward - 10CC) DR does not contain any real outstanding somgs and does not sound -not of this worldlike- as PtP sometimes does. A must for Macca die hards but not a must for music lovers."
2,one of Paul's worst albums,Worst if not the worst album. I can't believe someone compared this album to Ram in one of the reviews. These lyrics are so predictable I find that I could sing the next line before Paul did my first time listening to most of it. (...)
4,Very Good,"Good songs, and a great band. The experimental nature of the recording is really endearing, and Paul's in fine voice.What album are you guys listening to? Not this one.4 stars."
5,Oxford Family Encyclopedia: The Ultimate Single-Volume Reference,I bought this for my grand-daughter to use for her school work and was impressed not only with the condition (as it was gently used) but also by the range of topics that it covers!
2,"Interesting Premise, Badly Executed","From the description of this movie, you'd think that it would turn out to be a lot more interesting. The plot was interesting and the threads weaved into the movie were important, however, the execution of the movie left much to be desired. Once this movie was over, I was left with no real understanding of what this movie was trying to say. The middle of the movie left me confused and the end offered no real resolution."
3,Nice Film,but it really depends on the level of interest you have in elephants. Even though the photography is good; my interest in elephant's seem to have peak with this film. After a second viewing I was a little bored. I think a better balance Imax film is Africa: The Serengeti which has some spectacular photography and moves at a faster pace. This film conentrates on elephants and if you have a big interest in this subject you should be happy. There are some nice shots and one sequence were they use time lapse photography of a thunder storm was a highlight. But that sequence lasted for just 30 seconds. To be fair my interest in elephants is limited. My interest in Imax films is high. For me this film is a good rental but not one to buy.
4,Shortcuts - Legs & Buns Gets Results,This video is well worth the price. The video is actaully three separate 10 minute workouts with advancing difficulty. Denise recommends starting with the first workout for a couple of weeks before moving on. More advanced individuals may want to do more than one workout at a time. Each workout has a short warm-up as well as stretching for cool down. I found the instructions easy to follow and the exercises are definately challenging and target the area promised. For ten minutes a day you can't lose!
5,Holy.....!,"I JUST got this in the mail and i was STUNNED! this is not for people who are feeling angry,its more of an upbeat song to get you happy if your blue. the first song is the song you should hear first. its the greatest song next to Zulu/Free. get this cd and you wont be disappointed(including that its cheap). mine was a used one but it doesnt skip and its in very good condition. if you like radiohead or the eels. its more happier than their other cds."
4,One Hit Wonder? I Think not...,"I just recieved the CD Music for the People and absolutely love it, even though the only song I had really heard from this artist before was their hit ""Touched"" used in many movies, commercials, and so forth. This album has great song which have a feel of their hit ""Touched"" and many which are completely different and are equally enjoyable. I hope to hear more from this artist soon"
2,Sub-par album that gets John Crosby more exposure,"In 1998, VAST released the stunning ""Visual Audio Sensory Theater,"" a great mix of pop, rock, industrial, and ethereal tendencies. No one really noticed. Although VAST was on a major label, they recieved little recognition from mainstream radio or TV and their album could be found in discount bins everywhere. ""Music For People,"" VAST's second release, actually has a perfect title. It seems it was made for the mainstream music consumer rather than as a new expression of VAST's unique musical vision. It's not the worst album ever, but gone are the driving industrial beats and rare are the ethereal samples that made their first album so great. Instead, we are presented with an album of pure rock/pop (the first song sounds WAY too much like the Goo Goo Dolls for me). BTW, since this album's release it's been all over the radio and VAST has toured with such mediocre bands as Eve 6."
4,extravagent!!,this is a pretty good return for jon crosby i like heavy music so i was naturally impressed by this extreme quartet this cd is fairly new to me so the only song i like is free but im sure i will grow to like the other vast songs as i have in the past so i am naturally impressed very song is well mixed and over all excellent!
5,I'm A HUGE Eva Cassidy Fan!!!,"A friend gave me one of Eva's Blues albums & I fell in love with her!!! Once I learned that she had passed away with cancer, I made it a life's mission to purchase every one of her albums before I joined her. ""Wonderful World"" is a collection of some of her better songs. She had such a lovely voice that it breaks my heart that she is no longer here to share it with us!!! If you listen to some of the samples, I'll bet you will want to buy this one!!!"
3,Took The Easy Way Out,Most people who watch this movie probably look at the photo on the box cover and wonder what happens AFTER that scene. At the risk of spoiling the ending I will simply say the director has no idea so he creates a sort of symbolic nonsense. We don't know if either couple will be more or less unsatisfied or will even stay together. I call it false advertising.
2,Oh my... maybe a little too frank,"I bought this book as a gift for a teenage girl. It said, ""Guarding your mind, heart and body in a sex-saturated world,"" and that sounded perfect. Before giving it to her, I flipped through the pages and read a little bit here and there. To my astonishment, it went WAY beyond telling young women how important is is to live their lives in a Christian fashion. There was a section of the book on the evils of masturbation. I expected the book to contain reasons why sexual purity was important, ideas and tips for protecting virginity, etc... Needless to say, I'm glad I read this before I gave it as a gift -- I would have been SO embarrassed. I've chosen another, less explicit book instead.Maybe this book would be better for an older teen... But if you're considering this as a gift, please take the time to read it and decide if you feel comfortable with the text before you give it away."
1,"How to damage a teenage girl's esteem, physically and mental awareness","I read this book because there was a reference to it in an article I read on the failure of ""abstinence only"" sex education. This book is an insult to teens and adults, the most archaic piece of clap-trap I have read in a long time. One of the chapter headings should have been ""You'll go blind if you masturbate!"" Really. It's that bad. Stay far, far away...."
3,"Ok, but not the best..","this wasn't the best book ever.. but it was very much worth while. WARNING TO ALL: this is NOT a book about peer pressure or friends.. this is about guys, girls, and sex. Although it would be soooo helpful to teenage girls if they seemed to boy crazy, looking for the wrong type of boys, or were the target of some particular guy already, this book is not the best! *sigh* It was a very good read though. And it did teach me more! I actually couldn't put it down! Although could've been better, it is a very good book to read."
2,"Too predictable, sub-par character development","While I appreciate the author's attempt to write an entertaining Christian novel, and while the theme of the novel is very relevant, it was apparent to me fairly early on what direction the story line was going. I kept waiting for it to take a truly unexpected turn, and it never did. Also, I think a better job could have been done of portraying the inner struggles of the main character."
4,Debut Extraordinaire,"It's happened all the time: every some other year a new vocalist emerges and she is either labelled as The New Diva or The Shooting Star.Mariah falls definitely in the first category.Her debut went on to win at the Grammy's, got 4 # 1 hits on top of the charts, and established her as a music name.Sony gave alot in terms of production: Ric Wake (previously known for his work with Taylor Dayne), Narada Michael Walden (Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin) and Walden's long-time partner Walter Afanasieff (that from this moment on created with Carey his own career in a sense...).Not so much when it comes to writers, but Carey delivers co-writing skills that are very good for a first-timer.SOMEDAY and YOU NEED ME are energized and aggressive, LOVE TAKES TIME and ALL ALONE IN LOVE are beautifully made for the AC lovers while VISION OF LOVE and I DON'T WANNA CRY give Mariah a shot as an R'n'B diva..."
5,Why can't every singer's debut be this good?,"At the time of this album's release, I was working as a DJ at a local radio station. When the promotional copy of ""Vision of Love"" was delivered, I wondered about the very attractive girl on the cover. Was she just ""pretty packaging"" with little else to offer?Man, was I, like the rest of the world, blown away when Carey opened her mouth! Both ethereal and haunting, the first single was like nothing on the charts at the time. I knew that MC was headed for greatness.Following that auspicious debut, the album also produced a slew of top 10 hits. It's as if the gods themselves had bestowed on Carey the musical ""Midas Touch"" for all that she sang turned to gold, or in musical jargon, platinum.As a testament to the music of the 90's, this album should be placed in time capsule. It remains at the top of the list as one the best representations of the sounds of that decade."
5,vision of old times,I bOUGHT THIS FROM hastings this christmas . i thought the cd was going be bad at firstbecause right when i got outside i saw that it was recorded in 1989 . But When I gOt home i listened to someday and i was wondering why this album wasent still at number 1 on the bill board 200 it contains vision of love there's got to be a way i dont wanna cry somday vanising alone in love prisonor love takes time and more . this album rocks .
1,PLEASE STOP THE HORRIBLE SCREACHING !!!!!,"When is this terrible ""singer"" going to retire?!!!.I cant stand it anymore.Music should be beautiful,this is utter rubbish!."
1,"HER HIGH NOTES ARE NOT DELIGHTFUL, THEY'RE SIMPLY TERRIBLE","Mariah wants us to believe she is a birdie to wake up us every morning by her horrible squeek. Her debut album is a mess, she wants to be Taylor Dayne, she wants to be Whitney, and at the end we all know she wanted to be a ho from the ghetto. Vision of Love a treat for the ederly, she inspired Snoop with this but in what way?...the original record didn't included LOVE TAKES TIME, that's because the recorded another try to be hit, so the album will actually hit....Brenda K. Starr must be biting herself, cos her former background vocalist got more attention than her, life sometimes sux...this album is NOT REAL, cos MARIAH say so, she said that she wanted other type of music...hummmmmmmmmmmm so that makes this another fake record in the industry, with a birdie song, bye bye birdie."
3,It's novelty ice cream ~ it's fun & interesting,"Inside this little package, inside a white paper wrapping that is normally around ice cream treats, is this little square of dehydrated ice cream.It looks and feels like styrofoam.I also think it tastes like what I imagine styrofoam would feel like in my mouth.You let it ""melt"" on your tongue ~ Don't chew it.The flavor is subtle. There is a distinct ""fat"" taste as it coats your tongue.My children and their friends LOVE this. I think it's because it's so different.Did I like it ~ No. I thought it was gross. I did not like anything about it except that it's novel.HOWEVER, I would still recommend others try it, simply because it is so different."
5,good,and realy master class book. Now i know some secrets from they kitchens.. :) I realy looking for part 2
3,balanced view,"Parrish's focus on individuals is the book's strength. Parrish is a true synthesis historian. For example, Parrish had a balanced approached of synthesizing the traditional views of the Great Depression with more non-traditional issues. He discussed the traditional topics of poverty, lost fortunes, and food lines. Yet he also had sections of neglected topics like the disruption on family life, the popularity of sex in the film industry, and how many had positive views of the Great Depression. He concluded: ""The Great Depression drove some Americans apart and simultaneously brought others together in a common cause. For some the Depression confirmed the rottenness of capitalism and the need for revolution. For others it would be the best of times, when people reached out to help others, and when the government took the side of the underdog to battle injustice."""
5,Fantastic Book,It was so nice to see a book that showed how difference can be overcome by simply standing up for yourself. I think every third grade classroom should have this book. It is also nice to see Muslims portrayed in a postive light for a change.
4,A story with a Christie-like twist--well done,"It's always flattering to stumble across a writer who shares one's views of the strengths and weaknesses of another writer, as Barnard shares mine of Agatha Christie. In reading his own mysteries since, I've come to the conclusion that, unlike Christie, Barnard is at his best in short fiction, rather than the novel. But he does very well in this novel. It's a little slow going at first, as he sets the scene in a sleepy English village, but sticking with it proves to be well worth the wait once the murder happens. Barnard leads the reader down a primrose path that's worthy of Christie at her best; I'd doubt anyone who claimed to have seen the solution coming. Nor is it a ""cheat""; all the clues were there, the solution doesn't insult the reader's intelligence or sense of justice, and the summing up is emotionally satisfying."
5,Entertaining and Relevant to Everyone,I LOVE the way that Fred Alan Wolf speaks on this book. There are so many Audiobooks out there that simply talk at you. In this he annunciates and has fun talking about quantum physics and its relativity to the consciousness of man. Great audiobook. Very Recommended!!!
1,Complete waste of time,"While Dr. Wolf has written some compelling books, this work is complete nonsense. If you are looking for anything interesting about quantum physics, do not look here. If you are looking for stream-of-consciousness nonsense psycho-babble about the ""real you"" then this is for you. Doesn't appear that he actually prepared anything for this recording; he just blathers on and on without any coherence. Complete nonsense and a waste of time and money. Deserves zero stars but I am forced to give one star as the minimum allowed here."
5,A movie worth the wait,"When I saw this movie I was the only one in the theater. I spent large amounts on money, for a 12 year old to see it. I remember a large amount of (...) for Universal in putting out this movie. It was until years later that I found out that the movie had pretty much been cut in two. From 14 reels of film to 7. (...) it is not suprising that universal is taking their own sweet time in getting this out."
5,Finally...,I have one of my favorite movies in my collection. So glad to have found this and am glad to be able to watch it over and over.
4,A Classic Fantasy Movie,"If you want a movie that will satisfy your thirst for a good, classic fantasy flick, then definitely pick up a copy of Legend. It has a nostalgic feel when you watch this movie, with the 80's soundtrack and young actors, and it is a film that is worth watching several times and sharing with your friends, family, and even children. From demons to unicorns, fair maidens to heroic men, and elves to fairies, this movie has it all. The only reason I would ever dock points from this film is the fact that there are a few moments of cheesy acting and the fact that the battle scenes are not as impressive as some of our modern fantasy films, such as Lord of the Rings. However, I would rank this movie to be one of my all-time favorites."
3,Not Quite There,"Sucessful Fantasies are rare in film, and this is not one of them. Though it surely is pretty to look at and Lily's transformation from innocent princess to queen of hell is fascinating to watch."
3,Legend,"Although beautifully photographed and well directed, this filmhas Tom Cruise's (and alot of other great actors) talent goingto waste. Legend does have the ability to enchant the eyes, butthe screenplay and the majority of the acting is painful on the ears. I had to increase my star rating because of the beautifulphotography here. If it wasn't so beautiful to look at, this film would have received a big, juicy, single star!"
4,Unicorns,This is an interesting movie. It's with Mia Sara as Lilly. A girl who accidentally looses the unicorns ( in a way ) to the world. It's a very beautiful movie. I love the dress that Mia Sara wears in it .It's a different movie fantasy wise and it's really good to watch every once in a while.
2,Not for Kids,"I picked up legend because my daughter is into the fantasy genre (Ladyhawke, Dragonheart, Pricess Bride). I was dissappointed with this movie.Legend has all the elements that should make it a great fantasy film, Unicorns, fairies, elves, goblins. . . an innocent princess and a really evil villan. Somehow it still falls flat. It never inspires a real rapport with the characters. The best character is Tim Curry's devil.The emphasis of the film is more on the visual scenery than the storyline. Way too much time is spent grubbing around in ""hell"", which was way too creepy for us. Tom Cruise was a two dimensional hero. Not enough substance there to get worked up over.Our two girls (10 & 11) were very disturbed by it, to the point they couldn't sleep. I don't recommend it for pre-teens."
1,Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack stinks,Want to know why 73% of people who bought this DVD bought the Ultimate version next? Its becasue they (like me) didn't know they were getting the version with the Jerry Goldsmith soundtrack. His soundtrack STINKS! It ruined the entire movie. Not only that but this version has edited out the really cool scenes of Tim Curry in the black light---gone. Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage get the version with the great soundtrack from tangerine dream.
5,Darkness and Thighs,"This was one of my top favorite movies to watch when I was a child, along with The Dark Crystal, Labrinth(yummy jareth), The Neverending Story, and The Goonies. I love the look, I loved the music, it was all so magical and captivating. I have to also add that I wasnt in love with Tom Cruises character Jack, I had the hots for Tim Currys character Darkness, twisted I realize, but I also had the hots for Dr. Frankenfurter. Something about those evil men, and Tims voice in particular. Legend IS a legend amoung the films of the 80's, and will be so till the end of time."
5,A fantastic fantisy! Great for Tim Curry fans!!!,"This is a very entertaining movie. I really enjoy Tim Curry as Darkness He has only a medium size role, but that's okay. Because his performance is well worth it. Of corse he is the villian and as usual he dies. Tim Curry fans are alittle tired of this. All in all this is a hugh must have for Tim fans!!!"
3,Wonderful tale...,"Legend is a classic tale of good versus evil. Tim Curry is simply amazing as the Devil, who is determined to cast the world in darkness by capturing the last unicorn's horn. Jack (Cruise) and Lily are young lovers who are completely unaware of the evil that is around them. When Lily is captured as well, Jack must rescue her with the help of the magical creatures in the forest.Cruise does pretty well in his role, but I think the focus should really be on Curry. The makeup is incredible, complete with red skin, huge horns, and hoofed feet.If you enjoy a classic fairy tale, Legend should definitely be on your list."
5,Excellent ! Great for all ages,This movie is topped by only Labyrinth.It has fantasy for the young ( or young at heart;) ) I has big evil baddies and action for grownups. Be adivesed Darkness might scare little tots . I recomend this for children ages 6-100 .
5,A fantasy masterpiece,"Best Fantasy movie ever! Heads above LOTR. Jack (Cruise) must penetrate the frightful castle of Lord Darkness (Curry) and fight him following the kidnapping of a unicorn. Lily (Sara) is wooed by Darkness. Jack must win her back and save the unicorn before the sun sets forever. For best results, watch with the Tangerine Dream Soundtrack. Easily in my top 5."
3,Some much needed clarification!,"There is some hot debate over this dvd. When I purchased it, I thought I was getting the european version of Legend (the best) with the American version on the other side, effectively the same two-disc edition that I fell in love with at my local North American video. But buyer beware! This version of legend (the one that isn't the ultiimate edition) is only the final directors cut, and it is probably my least favorite. There are 4 versions of this movie out there: the american, the european, the tv special edition, and the directors cut. the european is the best because it has a lot of the footage the american version doesn't without the awful soundtrack or stupid ending of the directors cut which ruined the movie for me. grab yourself a copy of the ultimate edition and look on ebay.uk for the european, my personal fav!"
5,under rated film,"This is one movie I feel that never was giving the credit that it should have gotten.The effects are great and Tim curry as the Dark lord was just Awesome!!.Anytime that I have told someone about this movie and has watch it says the same thing.This one is a Classic for me.Thanks,Robert"
2,Not the Legend I remember,"I recently picked this up to replace my worn out VHS version. I thought the extras would be a nice bonus since this is one of my favorite childhood movies. Upon the first 10 minutes I realized something wasn't right. The Music was AWFUL. It was so cartoony and plays ALL THE TIME. It got down right annoying. I always remembered the soothing beautiful music. Getting online Did a bit a research to find Legend has two soundtracks. The European version by Jerry Goldsmith and the American Version by Tangerine Dream. If you want the American version with the ""Loved by the sun"" This isn't the version you want."
3,Legend,"This is not Tom Cruise finest work. If you like fantasy movies then it's worth your time and money, otherwise save your money. I gave it 3 stars because of the superb acting from Tim Curry the Devil. Really like the Devil's character."
5,release the DVD please,"I ordered this DVD the second that I saw that it was going to be released on Jan. 9 2001. We'll it's Feb. 3 and it has been pushed back to some unknown date. I've been searching for the European release of this movie for about 8 years now and am very excited about the idea of actually seeing it in it's intended form. I'm tired of waiting, release it already. Or just send an advanced copy my way so I can stop whining about already. If you're finding this review usful that I'd have to say you're whining too. To all the whiners out there, may you enjoy a fine bottle of wine on your virgin viewing of this Jerry Goldsmith version. Visit me at ""iwonderifishouldgrowfacialhair.com"""
2,Director's Cut Not Worth Watching,"I grew up watching this movie over and over. The original soundtrack by Tangerine Dream made the movie for me, and helped create the world.The director's cut has new scenes that were mercifully cut from the theatrical release, and a new soundtrack that puts a weird campy, pathos-ridden feel to the movie.I couldn't even get 20min in without turning it off, it was that bad.If you're going to get this movie, buy the original theatrical release."
5,"I loved it then, I love it now...and so does my daughter","This is the only film I remember so vividly watching the first week it went to the theatres. I was in High School. I have never been a huge movie fan, but I love this movie.Now at 35, my 6 year old daughter loves it too. I was worried it would scare her but when it was over she just said, ""I loved it mommy."" I have rented it so many times since it first came out on video and now dvd. It is time to just buy it.It is actually a beautiful movie. I remember loving that the most in the theatre, and now on my TV.It is so worth a try. Remember it was about 1986...so it isn't super hi-tech. And it may not have done well at that time...but critics are often WRONG!!It has been loved by many for many years now!"
5,Great Fantasy Movie,One of Tom Cruises first films - This movie takes on a Fantasy story with in depth details to storyline and costumes that make it an Epic movie that is one-of-a-kind!
2,Ridley Scott's Worst,"This is Ridley Scott's absolute WORST. I realize that this film has a strong fan following, but I have to say it: this sloppy mess of a movie is just plain horrid. The storyline is so cheesy and insane. I realize that fantasy movies are supposed to be cheesy, but come on. The dialogue is excrutiating to listen to. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone. The acting, with the possible exception of Tim Curry, is atrocious.But it's not ALL bad. The effects are wonderful, and Ridley Scott's visual style makes this movie very easy on the eyes. But great special effects don't make a great movie. If you want to see a great fantasy movie, I would recommend Lord of the Rings instead of this unintelligible mess. Oh, by the way, I belivieve an earlier reviewer said this was a great movie to show to your children. DON'T, unless you want them to have nightmares until they're 30."
1,A waste of good talent,"Visually appealing, but the story stinks, particularly in character development. For the first time in my life, I was so utterly bored that I considered stopping the tape midway. Serious fantasy fans, forget it. It has the intelligence of a head of cauliflower. It isn't worthy of the fine talents of Tim and Tom."
1,"""For goodness sake SHUT UP!""","My sister likes this movie but don't. I like the whole idea of a fantasy movie but this was a poor attempt. Any movie that leaves me asking more than three question to me is bad.1. Why did Jack show Lilly the Unicorn?2. Why didn't Jack try stopping Lilly?3. What in heaven is Jack?4. What's up with that guy in the helmet? Why was he hanging around the goblins?5. How can anybody with the name ""Brown Bottom"" NOT be mocked?Plus I hated the music that asked ""For goodness sake"" got on my nerves quickly. Should have kept the enchanting irish music."
4,Great Movie for Fantasy Lovers,"This movie has a dramatic plot and a very enjoyable movie to watch for Sci-Fi Fantasy lovers everywhere.I simply loved it,one of my favorites by far.You can never get tired watching it."
5,outstanding,chad is an incredible musician/artist/person-hey chad if you get this message go cowboys-haven't talked in a couple of years now-been trying your website but it won't let me through! boyd and all say hi! glad to hear you're still sounding hot! tim your long-lost-co-employee! anyone like cheesecake?
5,Easy to put together and super strong,There isn't a lot more that I can add that others haven't already said.I needed some sturdy boxes for transporting and storing books. I had about a dozen medium sized coffee table books in one of these and the box worked just fine - felt a lot stronger and capable than just your regular box. These stack well and and the cardboard seems capable of handling a lot of weight placed on top of it. The interlocking covers are also kind of nice.
2,A&E/New Video customer service is poor. Product packaged incorrectly,"BUYER BEWARE: I purchased this set thinking I had the ENTIRE Danger Man series, but when I got to disc 7 I found that the company A&E/New Video had mistakenly put disc 4 in the case so now I have two disc 4's and no disc 7's. When I contacted A&E/New Video's customer service several times asking them if they could send me disc 7 in the mail I got no response. So purchase this, or any other A&E/New Video title, at your own risk but realize they'll leave you out in the cold if their product turns out to be defective."
2,Nothing but a clone...,"I was a huge fan of the original movie, and I went into this one expecting something different. Some sort of new twist or perspective.What I got is basically the exact same movie, only this time in color, with a less impressive casting job, and all the dialogue rewritten so that the plotline is spoon fed to you.I don't know what's worse, the fact that certain shots are remade almost perfectly from the old movie, or the fact that almost the first twenty minutes are devoted to characters explaining to each other things which were obvious to the viewer in the first movie, without the characters stopping to tell each other how they felt. For a movie that's based around the last hour before noon, there's a remarkable lack of suspense here.It would have been hard to top the original, but they didn't even bother trying here. This is just a poorly made clone."
3,Only so-so results,"I don't know what others with good results may or may not have done differently, after hooking everything up, I couldn't pass 1080p through it, but let me explain. When I set my blu ray player to 1080p output, the signal passes through my receiver and through the cable in question to my projector, but the picture breaks up and disappears for seconds at a time. If I switch the player to 720p, the picture is fine. The picture passes through 2 wall plates as well, so I can't say for sure what is causing the issue, but there you go.Other than that, the cable seems to be well constructed with gold connectors as pictured. Returning this would be not worth it for me as I live in Canada, so I'll eat the loss and try a 30 ft cable from Blue Jean."
1,Mid-life crisis at 30,"Don't depend on the packaging. I bought this movie for about $5 at a nationwide well known store. The current photo and the name of Danny Devito is plastered all over the dvd (including the description). The description made it look like that Danny Devito was ""Over thirty...overweight...over the hill and still over confident"". When purchasing the movie, I figured that it was a movie made in 2005 (perhaps a foreign or independent film), but it was a movie in 1973 and Danny Devito has a very minor role (maybe 3 scenes).This movie is suppose to be a comedy. I found the description on the package to be more funny than the movie. Want to know more about the movie? All it takes is to read the description...you've just basically watched the whole movie for free just by reading the description and putting it back without purchasing. A definite waste of a DVD and another coaster in my collection."
1,Hurry up or I'll be 30,"By its original name and in the early 1970's when it first came out a watchable typical B or C movie of the time. However, the passage of time - which is one of the themes of the movie - hasn't served it well. Nor has the elevation of Danny Devito's role, relatively a minor one in the movie, to the star billing. Bottom line - the movie and its message are dated, but OK if you're nostalgic for New York City circa 1970."
5,definitely hardcore,this film is amazing and shows the extreme side of the mountain bike world. It should be watched by everyone.
1,Bad copy,"Ordered NWD 9 Never Enough Blu-ray Disc on Jan. 28, 2009 and tryed to play it on 2 different blu ray players and neither one worked. Bummer!"
1,Great Story ... Horrible Writing!!!!,"The story was great but some of the words in Spanish were just not well written. On the top of my head I remember a quote from the book, ""clara que no"" (as in of course not) It's translated to ""claro que no"". I know this book was written for teens but I'm a teacher and I teach high school, I suggest the book before reading it. We would found flaws in the book almost every other day and that was the talk about in class. I honestly think my fifteen year old students can do a better job writing a book."
1,Disappointing,The pad is small compared to other heating pads I have had and it does not get hot. The highest setting gets warm at best.
2,Just not hot enough,"We can send people to the moon but apparently the perfect heating pad is still beyond us. I bought this pad for hand/arm/wrist and neck rsi. Plus side: Great size that covers all back and neck; auto shutoff; long cord; 3 heat settings. Minus side: Too stiff to wrap around my arm or wrist; there's no way to turn off the auto shutoff feature which is on the quick side; and it's really just not very hot. I had your standard-issue Walgreens Sunbeam before this one, and it was several factors hotter (if that pad was a the temp of a nice hot bath, this one runs about the temp in in the shower when you know the hot water's about to run out). I need more heat to really relax my tight muscles. If you're heat-sensitive this could work for you. And my cat is quite fond of it."
2,Rough edges,"I wanted to like this heating pad and I was sitting against it in bed reading, but my arm kept brushing past the hard plastic edges of the actual pad, which kept sticking out of the cover. This constant scratching was irritating. The sponge that you moisten is so thin that it tore the first time I tried to put in back in the cover. The length of the pad was however a good feature,"
1,Dead in 2 1/2 months,It was an ok mp3 player while it lasted. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more to get a name brand.
2,Cheap Quality!,"Bought this knowing it was plastic but had no idea how cheap it would turn out to be. The clips are falling apart after one week of use and that's without any kids tugging at it, just mom carefully storing toys, or trying to. The plastic itself is so cheap it's unsightly. The length of it is nice but I wouldn't purchase this again. Along with poor quality I'm disapointed at how few toys can actually be held by the clips and the chain links themselves are too narrow for toys to link directly into them. I would advise you to look around and spend more $$ if you have to!!"
2,"Great Music & Performances, Disappointing CD","I must agree with the previous reviewer, who found this CD 'lacking in grandeur'. The vocal performances and music are meticulously crafted and delivered, and may indeed be true to the spirit of the period in which they were written. But they are curiously lightweight, and I felt like I was listening to musical fluff. ""Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring""--in my opinion, the most moving of all the cantatas--was far too fast-paced: it sounded distressingly like the Minute Waltz. ""Sleepers Awake"" received similar treatment. Professionally, all of the performers on this CD undoubtedly delivered, but what they delivered was curiously lacking in the soul-stirring majesty that Bach's cantatas can evoke."
2,Where is the grandeur?,"One of the above reviewers mentions the ""bouncy"" and ""jaunty"" tone of Gardiner's rendition. This CD is so bouncy it sounds like a Baroque precursor of disco! ""Wachet auf"" lacks the grand march quality in its opening and closes with a thin chorale. No full bass harmonies in the chorales. No stirring the heart toward rapture here! ""Jesu..."" is similarly thin and too fast. I regret buying this disk and doubt I will every listen to it again. Bach chorales and cantatas should tingle the spine and shake the cathedral windows. Gardiner's ""Bach light"" doesn't fill my family room."
2,Had to rebuild,"Bought the IR assuming a quality tool, wrong. The outer shell could not be moved without extreme effort. Finally got it apart and found burrs left inside the housing from the manufacturing process, Ground them off with a dremel, reassembled and now works OK. In hindsite probably shoud have just sent the whole thing back. Its not made in USA but China. I have found some of their stuff OK but they have lousy quality control"
4,"Great ""intermediate"" tape","Denise Austin was the first instuctor to get me up and exercising. I find her particular style easier to take than most instructors who have unnaturally thin bodies (why are they always topped by unnaturally well padded chests?). She's enthusiastic, knowledgeable and ""real"". This particular tape was one that I looked forward to and actually sought out. I bought her book ""Fit and Fabulous after 40"" and love it. The tape should have been the adjunct to the book. It's a great tape. A great workout. Intermediate, not beginners. The aerobics is all floor, no step. The toning is well instructed and it has her usual great warmup and cool down. And it was also issued under the title ""Age Defying/Baby Boomers Workout"". Very disappointing when you find the workout is same as one you already own under a different title (no indication on the cover that it's been re-issued). My recommendation is buy it, unless you already have it!"
1,Do Not Buy,This product is one of the most disapointing things I have ever bought. It only lowers your bra strap about a 1/2 inch and it makes your bra so loose feeling that your not comfortable. Its just not worth buying.
1,I don't get it,"I didn't have the ""loose bra"" problem that others had, but this thing did not drop the back of my bra by much. Also, the directions said to strap one end to your bra, criss-cross it in back, and strap it in front. Huh? Unless I'm missing something, that's just not possible. If you bother to waste your money, just put your bra on as usual, then have hubby unhook it, attach one end of the strap to one side of your bra, wrap it around the front of you, and have him hook the other end to your other bra strap. Oh, also, the front strap ""rolls"". I want my money back."
2,Won't hold a seal.,"Disappointed because these stoppers simply won't hold a seal. Had to return to a regular, manual vacuum device instead, whereas this would be a great solution if it just held a seal."
5,old time movies,"While I remember seeing this at a young age, to rate it now, not seeing it again would not be correct, as the item purchased was for a gift."
4,Sturdy Rack,Have used this several times already and am very pleased. Jars do not tip easily on this rack. Folding handles feel very secure when raising and lowering the rack...just need to be careful that you don't position jars in such a way that they get in the way when you are folding the handles back in a bit to put the lid on the boiler.
5,AOR/Hard Rock Classic,"Diving For Pearls had a video with heavy rotation on MTV with the song ""Gimme Your Good Lovin'."" If you are into bands like Bad English, Alias, Giant and Danger Danger You will not be able to get enough of this classic CD. There is not a bad song on the CD and the musicianship is flawless. You have great power ballads and mid tempo rockers that will leave you wanting more. This is definitely in the top 10 all-time classic AOR CD's. Don't miss out or you will regret it."
3,Probably a classic,"The coming of age in ancient Egypt of a brilliant young man that covers details of everyday life, organization of the social structure and the theo-political belief structure seems pretty historically accurate.The name Her-Bak echoes for me Per Bak with this nature based religion wherethe idea of order are much like self-organized criticality.Somehow the author lacks the ability necessary to ""hook"" the reader's interest and involve him emotionally with the maincharacter: the result is too impersonal for me.It is an educational book and might be better broken up into wisdom myths or tales."
4,A Lifevest to Those Left Behind,"Most of the reviewers have totally missed the point. If you read the ""Left Behind"" books, or watched the ""Tribulation"" series movies, you saw that the believers leave a video to tell those left behind where they have gone, what is going to happen in the tribulation, and how to receive Christ as their Savior. This DVD is similar to those videos. So, it is not really a movie in the traditional sense, it is a movie for believers to purchase to leave as a message. It doesn't really have a plot line, a hero and heroine going through trials and tribulations, etc. However, if you are a Christian you should ask yourself, if the rapture happens, would I want my loved ones to know what happened to me, how to join me, and what to make of the Anti Christ? If so, this is for you."
5,A Must Buy!,"Pulling Birds are a great band! This album is an incredible display of talent, drive, and emotion. (And is that Jesse one cuite or what!)"
2,Blackbeard the Pirate(VHS TAPE),The movie itself is very good for 1950s acting and filming except the recorded vhs tape was very poor with voids and lines through the movie. The Seller stated that is was because of xray scanners during shipping and refunded full purchase price plus shipping costs.
4,Flight Spray for nasal Rehydration,"I use Flight Spray anywhere the air is dry - Convention Halls, in high altitudes, like the mountains, and in the desert as well as when I am on a plane. It keeps me from getting the dry, stuffed sensation I used to get on a plane.It was great in Las Vegas when I had to work for 4 days in the convention hall and the air was dry, and artificially cooled!"
3,Maybe Read The Three Musketeers Instead,"Alexandre Dumas is my favorite author, but this is not my favorite book. I thought d'Artagnan was a hilarious caricature of a passionate young man, but Maurice was a little creepy. His unrequited pining after and violent pursuit of a married woman reminded me of a teen stalker. I did enjoy the dystopian depiction of revolutionary France; It could be good romantic companion to Brave New World and 1984. The book ends with a touching image of friends united despite all obstacles, which made it worth reading to me."
1,Don't waste your time with this!,"About halfway through this book I started getting annoyed with the main character, Maurice. He was extremely sappy and emotional. He spent most of his time moping over a woman he couldn't have. I decided to skip to the end to see if it was worth it to continue. The end was so terrible, I was glad I didn't waste my time reading the whole thing."
4,Eh,"This book has some really good ideas as far as example rooms set up for you to go gaga over, but only an upholsterer could really carry through with a lot of these ideas. It shows some samples of remarkable flea market finds though. I personally thought that a lot of the spaces that were set up in the book were too cluttered and not usable realistically."
2,To junky,"I returned this book, as I thought the style was just to junky for me. I have been a yard saler for years and my decor I say is early yard sale, but I found that this book was just way over the top with a junky look. I could not find one idea that I liked, I think because there was just to much clutter ! I returned the book."
1,disappointment,This book was a huge disappointment. The pictures might be well taken but for design style they look like a squatter or homeless person settled into a vacant building that's ready for demolition and decorated with scarves and garbage. The cover was the best thing. No info. I wish I could get my money back.
4,"Help for Husband, friends and family","What an amazing read! So many great pointers for your husband, you and anyone close to you trying to help and to understand PPD. A must read for anyone who knows anyone going through it."
4,Exciting Story!!,This is one of only two novels that I was forced to read for school and actually ENJOYED! A definite page-turner! You won't be able to stop reading it!
3,I read them over and over!,This is a wonderful mystery series for young people who love God and action at the same time. I love to read books that are not too challenging after racking my brain at school. The vocabu;ary is easy to understand for kids ages 8-12. It is also reassuring to know that I am not the only one who gets annoyed and short-tempered. The mysteries involve every day life and feelings. The characters were all easy to relate to and helped me to get into the plot. Sometimes the mysteries were not developed enough making the suspense level not great enough.
4,Not what I expected but still happy with it,"I don't know what I was expecting when I ordered this cookbook. Maybe I was expecting it to have recipes that would be for my son's age only (1-2 years). It is full of recipes for all ages, which now I love! So many idea that would have never thought that I would make for my child :o)"
3,Very Funny but gets boring after awhile.,"To those who call this pure garbage --lighten up. The production values of this DVD may not be high, but it is very funny. Reminds me what would happen if South Park took over VH1's behind the music. The only problem I noticed with this DVD is after about 20 minutes it gets boring. This DVD is best taken in small doses.It consists of about 12 - 5 or less minute segments on various rock bands. Most are funny and completely trashed the bands we love. Unfortunately watching these back to back just does not work. Even when Beavis and Butthead aired, they needed to take a break between episodes to show something slightly different, and unfortunately this show suffers from the same fate. Hence why this DVD only gets 3 stars."
2,Waste of money,"I've seen behind the music that sucks on heavy.com for a while now as well as on Much Music TV. Do we really need to buy the DVD? Well if it's only [money] used, fine, but even at that low price, it seems a bit of a waste. Stupid humor is actually tough to create, there is a fine line between the subtle genius of say ""Dumb and Dumber"" and a total idiot making lots of poop jokes because he sees that they're in better made material. And this is my point. This video has hopped itself on the sophmoric bandwagon but hasn't added anything to the party other than bad animation. The last episode 'Behind the Local Band' (a made up one) is the funniest thing on the DVD -- which goes to show you that they're trying too hard to be funny by making fun of Britney Spears, but when left to their own devices, they actually do have good imaginations. Two stars just for the fake band segment. No stars for bad voice acting and poor menu's."
5,big people need this book too!,"kids, schmids--i see this as a story that can encourage ADULTS: take a page out of harold's book and create your own happy reality! no need to stagnate in a job, friendship, marriage or town that doesn't fulfill you: just step out on faith and ""draw"" what you need.i've done that very thing all my life... so i am honored that this book was written in 1955, my birth year!(you GO, harold!)"
3,Fun book but maybe not as exciting?,"I loved this book when I was younger so I jumped at the chance to introduce it to my 3 1/2 year old. She did like the book somewhat but hasn't really loved it as much as other books. For example, her favorite books these days are Pinkalicious, Giraffes Can't Dance and Tikki Tikki Tembo. TTT was again one of my favorites as well. The pictures are pretty simple and the storyline is also very linear so I think she didn't find it as interesting as newer books. Its the 50th year anniversary so you can't go wrong with this classic tale but it can't seem to keep up with the newer flashier books, I think. As an adult, I think its incredibly clever for Harold to create his world using a crayon and to get out of problems by using his wits and quick drawing ability. Maybe I should have introduced it a year ago?"
5,Imaginative fun,"This book takes the reader (and listener) on a journey of imagination. It's fun to read with your kid -- then get out the crayons and create your own journey together. A good story for evening, for quiet time."
2,Boring,This got great reviews so I tried it out. The illustrations are boring purple lines on white paper. We can't get past the first few pages in order to build up to the story. My 3 year old has never sat through it. Disappointed mommy.
5,One of the best bedtime books ever!,My 3.5 year old son adores this book and I do too. We read it nearly every night. Harold is an imaginative little boy who draws a world of his own. My son is always talking right along with the book about all the wonderful things he is going to draw. I think every child should have this book. I can't wait 'till my son can read it for himself!
4,a lttile long,First time I ordered a Harold book. I just hope my granddaugter doesn't decide to start coloring the walls.She picks up on everything so I will have to explain the book well. Rather long adventure for a 23 month old. Will wait and see if she will sit still for it to be read to her. Update later
1,Was not worth the trees used for paper.,This book was a peice o'... you know and wasn't worth the time or effort to read. My brother thoght it was lame and he is 8. I think you can do better with your selection of books.
4,Translates text very well and never crashed,"I was quite surprised to read the other negative reviews for Readiris Pro software, as I have been using Readiris for over a year without any problem. Occassionaly, I have to teach the program what a few letters are (for example, near the bottom of a page), but I have never had to do that more than 3-4 times per page. All text translated very well, and reduced my typing to less than 10% what it was before the program. Alhtough it is not the best Mac software out there, it certainly does what it advertises. And the program is easy to use."
2,(1) pillow case,"I am so aggravated that I just purchase (1) pillow case for $10.79! I really thought when you buy pillow cases they came in sets of (2). I am sure somewhere in the product description it mentions that there is just one, but amazon is not very user friendly. I could have purchased (2) pillow cases from wal-mart for $8.00. The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because obviously I'm the a-hole who doesn't know how to read thoroughly."
2,Cleans well with a bad smell,"Tried this before the Megapearls--bad move. This scent is very, very strong. Although I followed the instructions, I used it up a lot faster than the Megapearls.Don't bother with this product."
2,cowboys out of depth,Not a bad comedy. Cowboys help John Mills round up animals for his game preserve. Hayley is not in itOnly seen in brief crowd scene at airport.Comedy/drama pretty standard.
4,"Good video, some rare Stooge stuff!","This tape has some great Stooge films, some that have been lost for decades. This includes the Stooges' last film ever, KOOK'S TOUR (1970). That was a very interesting movie. The only thing is that there is absolutely no violence here. The most violent thing is when Curly Joe bumps his head on the boat. Interestingly, the same bonk sound from Stooge shorts is still used here. The Three Stooges Family Album was great. It had some never-before-seen home movie footage and publicity shots of hard-to-find Stooge shorts. JERKS OF ALL TRADES (1949) is a gem, with some great scenes of the Stooges as painters. This tape is well worth buying."
5,Smiles for the Impressionists!,I also found this jewel of a book at France in Epcot Center in FL.I have ordered an additional copy for a friend. Adults may also learn from this in depth children's book.Good to see this for a study and communication on art in history.
5,Upgrated Model!,"I have owned a Miami Dolphins Mail Box for the past 10 years plus. This mail box is made very well. In 2005 it survived Hurricane Wilma with no structural damage. My front yard was trashed. My 30 year old Black Olive Tree was up-rooted. The storm took out my paver driveway. I cemented my mail box post. Do this, and it will survive anything mother nature has in store. Recently, my son got me this new upgrated model for Fathers Day. It is awesome and tweeked even better!"
5,New Kids are still in my memory.,"I was one of the biggest New Kid fans back in 1989 and 1990. I even had the opportunity of seeing them in concert. I wouldn't get rid of my old CD's and tapes for the world. I wish they would get back together and make some more memorable music. In case you're wondering, my favorite New Kid was Jordan Knight."
5,"As good as I remembered, maybe even better!","This was the only album of theirs I owned as a child, and I loved it then. Hearing these songs again I was right back in elementary school! I think I can even appreciate some of the songs more now, than way back then."
3,an interesting LP,"This LP is all right, and has got original songs.The fast songs are very entertainig(step by step, games...)and the ballads are better, for example: baby i belive in you.But for my, the best is: time is on our side,is ereally the best."
1,Not satisfied,"I ordered two pet nets to put in my soon to be baby's room and I got two completely different colors. Organize.com told me about the disclaimer that they could not guarantee colors of the lining but I think it is terrible that you cannot choose. Also, I tried to called the customer service line for help and I couldn't go anywhere since I did not know the exact mailbox number I was looking for. I suggest not ordering from this company if you may have the possibility of returning items for various reasons."
3,"Good, but gets tiresome after a while","I used to love Babyface, I would save up my money axiously to buy his albums, and I loved For the cool in you and The Day, but now I'm kinda tired of him. Don't get me wrong, he's still one of my all time favorite artists, but I've stopped listening to him almost entirely. I decided after listening to Tender Lover I didn't need Lovers(the album that is) His voice is smooth and pleasing but after a while can become cloying and even sickening(sorry). It's no crime is cool and has a great beat, and the tracks up to Where will you go Interlude are super, but they fall apart little by little after that.Overall a decent buy, but his charm has just about worn out for me."
3,"Babyface enters pop territory on ""Tender Lover...""","If Babyface's first album and his chart-topping single with the Deele, ""Two Occasions,"" introduced us to him, then ""Tender Lover,"" his sophomore album, took him to another level. As one-half of the production duo L.A. & Babyface, he garnered such hits as ""It's No Crime,"" a song with a catchy beat. He then hit even bigger with the title track, which featured Bobby Brown rapping in the video version. However, Face's stamp soon became his romantic ballads, such as the classic ""Whip Appeal,"" which is most likely one every woman will fall for. ""My Kinda Girl"" is a nice mid-tempo selection for the ladies as well. Babyface easily convinces us that he can make it work both in the studio and on stage..."
5,Black love at its best !!!!!!,"I remember I was in school and this album came out everybody fell in love with the honest lyrics and melodies. Babyface had struck a chord with people young and old. I especially remember the girls really loved to sing ""Whip Appeal"" and the guys could also groove to ""Sunshine. With songs like ""Soon As I Get Home"" and ""Where Will You Go"" it'll make you wish you were in love with somebody. It was and always will be black love at its best."
4,C-Man,This is my fave' album & song by Babyface. I've got 2 verions of this album: The original & the 2001 re-issued version.
4,Quick service,I purchased this used and it arrived in about 5 days - it was in very good condition. Would purchase again from this vendor.
5,fabulous!!!,"i read this book when it first came out and after that anything else was just ""sloppy seconds"" please tell the publisher to hurry up and reprint it so i can buy it and read it over and over!"
1,Don't bother,"Hard to believe some of the stuff GRRM writes. For a guy that can write as well as he can, some of this stuff isn't worth reading. This book and Fevre Dream are two of them."
2,Good points and bad points,"This book contains some useful information about various practice areas. However, it also leaves out highly pertinent information.I am an ex-litigation attorney who left litigation because it was too confrontational. There is not a word in the litigation section of this book about the necessity of confrontation in this practice area. Instead the book talks about how litigation allows lawyers to develop ""relationships"" with clients.In general this book discusses the positives of each practice area without discussing the negatives. But the negatives can be highly relevant and very helpful when deciding what area of law is not for you. By reading this book you get the idea that you could enjoy numerous practice areas when this may not in fact be the case. Use the book for the information it does contain, but do so cautiuosly, keeping in mind that you need to dig further to find out the full truth about a practice area in which you are interested."
4,Good for those who are considering law as a profession,details explaination of each specialization in law. worth reading for those who are considering law as a profession but not sure which field they are interested in.
2,Fantom falls flat,"This vacuum is just not as powerful as it boasts to be. I always felt it was inferior, but getting a second opinion sealed it. I had my grand piano tuned, and the tuner asked to borrow the vacuum to clean out some dust. When I gave him this fantom to use, he told me ""you have a pretty weak vacuum here"". It couldn't even efficiently clean dust from a piano. the vacuum is only 6 months old, but I can't take it back, so I'm going to put an ad in the paper to get rid of it. Another thing is I find it difficult to store in a closet, and a pain to drag around. I'll be going back to an upright model, and I'm open to suggestions. :O)"
2,worst vacuum ever,"I own the fantom falcon for 6 months and the belt has gone bad on the power head. I placed an order for another belt and the fantom company told me it was on back order and it would take 6 to 8 weeks to get a new one sent to me. ""WOW"" no vacuum for that long, I have wall to wall carpet with a persain cat. I also don't like the way the hepa filter is on the basket it sits right in the middle of where you collect the dirt and that collects most of the cat hair and dirt> I always had to use a air compressor to blow out the dirt every time I used It. Please anyone looking to buy this vacuum that doesn't have a air compressor and has wall to wall carpet better think again."
5,excellent,I purchased this item for my 3 year old-with much hesitation-but upon receipt of this product I am truly satisfied with the purchase. After going through the book once with him he is now able to go through the other books on his own & has learnt quite a lot. I recommend this for other parents.
4,Learning can be fun,"My 5 year old son loves to play with his new LeapPad, he is learning spelling and so much more. The best part is he has cut down on TV time because he has more fun with the LeapPad."
3,Outdoor installtions could use additional moisture barrier.,Placed these outdoors in Florida and in location that received roof runoff. Had trouble with water accumulation in sockets. Required a protective barrier of duct tape to keep water out. Fried two of the units before solving the problem. Other than that they work fine
4,It is fine!!,Works just fine. Has a spike for ground mounting or a flat plate so it can be mounted to a wall or ceiling.
2,Worst looking DVD in Years,"I agree that this is one of the worst looking DVD's I have seen in a long time. (I don't have top of the line equipment either) The picture looked as if it were constantly raining. The digital artifacts are ever present, and annoying. I found myself so distracted, on several occasions, by how bad it looked, that i actually lost my place. I would not recommed this to anyone. Unless, like me, you missed the first few season on HBO"
1,It's just NOT funny . . .,"Yeah, blah, blah, blah about the transfer and the quality of the image, etc. I admit that I'm basing this review after having only watched two episodes, but that was all I could subject myself to. It's simply dated and not the least bit funny. Comparing it to seinfeld is ridiculous; You might as well compare your local semi-pro ball club to the '27 Yankees. Buyer beware!"
1,"Great show, terrible transfer","Fans of this delightful series will be extremely disappointed with the quality of this DVD. The video transfer is inferior to a VHS off-air recording, and brings to mind the bootleg copies of films sold illegally on the streets of Manhattan. It looks particularly bad on a large-screen TV.Columbia Tristar should offer free upgrades to customers who bought this. Garry Shandling -- are you listening? Help your fans do something about this!"
3,not as great as it could've been but stil lsolid,"Another successful movie from Barry Levinson (Wag the Dog, Rain Man), Man of the Year is hilarious and serious at the same time. Robin Williams' (Good Will Hunting, Mrs. Doubtfire) performance is funny and poignant at the same time. And Laura Linney (Kinsey, Primal Fear) truly shines. The last line of the movie is the punchline of punchlines."
3,Pleasantly surprised...,My friends slammed this as a 2-hour non-stop Robin Williams stand-up comedy event rather than a movie. I disagree; this movie was a light political satire that focused on a pertinent issue - the trend toward automated voting and it's lack of traceability. The movie could have been a little shorter - but it wasn't totally implausible. John Stewart for president anyone?
2,Slow Going,"I think this movie has potential to the right person. For me, the entire movie was slow. I just could not get into it."
3,LATE NIGHT WITH THE PRESIDENT,"If you're expecting a comedy, you may be disappointed. The only funny moments come with Robin Williams' talk show monologues; the story itself is pretty serious stuff so it ends up being a dramedy. And not a great one, but it's entertaining enough.Williams plays a comic who jokingly tosses his hat into the presidential election, and winds up getting on thirteen states ballots. A computer glitch amazingly gives Williams the election and he's suddenly the President. Of course, the young lady who knows about the computer glitch suddenly finds herself romantically involved and in danger of losing her life if she goes public.Williams is restrained, but not particularly great. Laura Linney is good as the computer analyst, and Christopher Walken does nice work as Williams' manager. The plot is fairly predictable and formulaic, but you still may find yourself entertained in spite of this."
2,Needed a programmer on writing staff,"The BASIC premise of this movie was interesting, and the story is mildly entertaining, but any high school student with programming experience could tell you that the reason behind the computer glitch is too lame to give any credibility. A college student with a couple of computer programming courses could design a more plausible excuse for a glitch."
5,Bipartisan Movie,"A funny movie that reflects people's general feeling of disgust with today's political system. No matter what political party you belong to, if any, you will love this movie. Robin Williams stars as a comedian/talk-show host who campaigns as an independent candidate for President because he's tired of both Democrats and Republicans and wants to give America an alternative choice. He becomes Ross Perot on speed. I sat through this movie thinking ""I might vote for this guy"" and, when the movie ended in the theater, people actually stood up and applauded indicating how it was hitting home. I can't wait to see the Director's Cut to find out what was left out! It's a must see and a must own!!!"
3,OK IT'S PREDICTABLE!.....SO WHAT?,"I think some people expect every movie to be the greatest film ever made! This comedy/drama could have been better, yes it's true! It was still an entertaining movie,even though I could see most of the twist coming a mile away! Would I buy it.....No! It was an OK movie to watch because I had nothing better to do. No problem. Williams and the cast do what they can with the script. It did have some good points and it was an interesting premise. Maybe we need someone like this in office because we haven't had any winners in there in a long time!"
5,Great book for the price,"Sure, it's a picture book, but the pictures are great and there's a lot of them. If you like pictures of Japanese ceramics and aren't too concerned about information or prices then buy this book. You can always get detailed info from other books. The book is worth the couple dollars I paid solely for the pictures and the small descriptions."
4,stylus 800,It is what I expected. It's very compact and easy to use. Picture quality is good. Enjoy not having a view finder. Image stabilizer is a plus.
5,No skill needed,"I don't know a lot about cameras, so I lucked-out when I bought the Stylus 800. It takes great photos with very little effort and skill."
1,Don't buy it!,"No power....literally, it only has enough to barely suck up the lint off of the floor in front of my dryer when bits fall out. Major waste of money, even the $20 it's offered for."
2,Not worth the money,"As with their New Zealand DVD, they fail to divulge where they are at any time. Am left wondering what the point of the film is . . . to show off their fly fishing skills? So what? Where exactly did they catch those monster trout? And I disagree with the comment about the soundtrack. Boring and inappropriate to the ""action"" on the screen. Definitely not worth the $27--$5.00 maybe."
4,Great Video,"Great video for those off season days, or for remembering those fond trips of your own to this great area."
3,Worthy edition beside your Friday the 13th collection,"Takes place at a camp with counselors that are told about a story about Madman Mars and if you yell his name loud enough, he will come to get you. One loudmouth counselor does just that and all hell breaks loose. Mars is kind of creepy, but he is no Jason V.A worthy edition to your slasher/horror collection."
2,Lame....lame...lame!,"Madman sucks!Bad music, very ugly performers, and the worst acting imaginable. I love cheesy 80's horror but this film just doesnt make the grade. The gore level is also hardly up to par!Madman Marz looks more like a fat hillbilly wearing obvious rubber hands and feet.This movie is just not well done. The only part I thought looked cool was the first shot they show of the madman standing up in the tree (same shot from DVD cover but looks different in the film). That was kind of spooky. It all goes downhill from there.You know your in trouble when they are actually showing the death scenes of each character in the beginning of the film before the characters have actually been killed.Pass on this one guys....."
2,WOW!!!!!!!,OK IS IT JUST ME OR IS THIS MOVIE ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS!!! I REMEMBER WATCHING THIS MOVIE WHEN I WAS ABOUT 9 YRS. OLD. IT WAS SOOOOO CREEPY THEN BUT IT'S FUNNY NOW AND THE CAST? WOW THEY ALL LOOK LIKE ALIENS FROM ANOTHER PLANET!!LOL I WAS MORE SCARED OF THEM THAN MADMAN!!!!!!!!!!
3,YA GOTTA LUV THE STINKY GREEN CHEESE !,"""MADMAN"" is a genuine 80's slasher cheesefest! A little scary,alot goofy & with the right buzz it can be a bunch of fun!"
2,I was disappointed!,I have read all of the reviews on here and being a huge fan of Horror flicks I thought I would give it a shot but I was very disappointed. It was poorly acted (which is common for those films)and boring.. I just could not get into it at all and my husband actually fell asleep.. it was certainly not the worst I have seen but I wouldn't see it again!
2,Wrong description,"My only complaint about this book is that it is listed as [Hardcover] even though it is not. No more new hardcover editions are being printed, so really all the brand-new copies are softcover.I bought this twice from Amazon and twice I received a paperback book even though the receipt says [Hardcover.]That was two or more weeks ago.Then, I just got a book through half.com and it came through Amazon, so I got to see that the error still hadn't been corrected.You could laugh at the fact I got the same book three times, but it would be best if Amazon could fix the product description to say Softcover.When it is corrected, they could take down my negative comment because the book itself is amazing as a text reference.Thank you."
5,An intro to geotech,"One of the best geotechnical books I've found. Easy to understand, enough examples to explain the points. One of the must buy for a geotech..."
4,Money Maze,This is perfect for younger kids. I have a 6 year old who loves it. Keeps them entertained. Younger kids will work harder if there is a small toy in there versus money.
3,fun while it lasted,"this cube maze worked great the first time for a birthday gift - took a 12 year old about an hour and a half to figure out the maze. however, the second time this was used, only days later, the ball got jammed under the plastic trigger's lip near the end of the maze; causing it to be inoperable and trash. There is no-way remove the ball from under the trigger lip, besides drilling holes around the ball to bend the inner plasic wall out. Fun while it lasted. For the price, I would buy another one."
1,Super LAME,the concept is really good however this thing is super lame and and really cheap. I give my newphew cash every year for Christmas and this concept seemed like it would be a fun way to gift him cash. He DID NOT EVEN NEED TO SOLVE THE MAZE TO OPEN THE BOX!!!! He was able to simply open the box and pull out the cash. I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS ITEM AT ALL. If you are considering rethink and save your money for something else!!! This item is super LAME.
1,cheaply made,"if it had not been 2 days before xmas I would have returned this puzzle box as the lid at the top was broken and would not stay shut, My son was able to super glue the tab thingy to make it work well enough. I bought five other puzzle boxes from another manufacturer paid less and had no problems."
1,Very dissapointed,"I purchased this money maze for my 14 year old brother and inserted cash. I am 12 years older than he is and was giddy with excitement over watching him agonize over solving the puzzle to get the cash out. It literally took him less than a minute to solve this puzzle and retrieve the money. Needless to say, I was crushed to see that he was able to solve the puzzle so quickly! What a disapointment!!"
4,Amazon Money Maze Teenage Snare,"We were giving money to a grandson for Christmas & he can completely open every present in about 30 min. This year we decided while we drank our 5 A.M. coffee we would have something for him to do. So we got the money maze box. Someone told us to be sure that the ball was at the bottom and that would take longer. It was great! We laughed, had coffee, doughnuts, and he still did not have it open. It was perfect ! Two or three of our friends have decided to try it next year and I hope we can come up with something that good again."
1,Magnif a piece of junk,The product came apart the second time we used it.I expected more from this.I was using it when the bottom came out in to my hands
1,Not worth the money!,I bought 4 of these mazes for my nephews and only one actually worked. The latch on the other 3 were not strong enough to keep the door closed. This is a waste of money.
3,perfect as geocaching challenge object,Saw this item once during a trip in Denmark and found it during a geocache search. I dreamed to purchase it one day but found it nowhere untiill geocachespoilers.com showed it recently on UtubeItem arrived within 14 days after purchase despite holiday season
4,Everlasting brush,Great high quality brush. On an expensive side but if you want to splurge on a brush that the one you should buy.I gave 4 stars because it gives some static to my hair but it's nothing versus the benefits I'm getting from using this brush
4,Awesome brush,"I never thought I'd cave and spend nearly $100 on a hairbrush, but I had read so many rave reviews and positive things about this brush that I finally saved up enough extra money and caved and bought one a few months ago and it was definitely worth it. I have medium length fairly thick hair that's fairly dry and this brush does make it shiny and look amazing when I brush my hair and I like the bristles a lot, they're not too soft and not too hard.My only two complaints are that my scalp starts to hurt after a while from the nylon bristles, I don't press very hard with the brush or use it for too long either, and the brush does make my hair pretty staticy so I usually have to put extra anti-frizz spray in and use my Sephora paddle brush after wards.Other than those two things, I love this brush, I use it daily."
2,Tiny but ineffective,It fits nearly anywhere because its so flat and small. But the rods in the umbrella are so weak that even a slight puff of wind will make it turn inside out. So it's relatively useless.
4,"Quality product, but a little small",This product works very well. It is very durable for its size. The only issue is that it provides limited rain protection. A sizeable portion of your body will still get wet.
4,Nice travel umbrella!,"Nice umbrella, can't believe how small and light weight it is. It easily fits in my purse. Not sure it could hold up to a strong wind though. :)"
2,Stiff mechanism,"I returned it because of poor quality----the mechanism for up/down didn't work smoothly. Otherwise the color, fabric, etc were just fine."
5,A New Day,"I really enjoyed this title. The story is fast-paced and the author develops her characters to the fullest. It's refreshing to read a book that I can relate to. The main characters, Max and Carol-Anne are characters brought back to life from the first book entitled, ""The Real Deal."" Excellent book for all to enjoy."
4,Difficult subject,"Spear has put together a good introductory volume on knife fighting, well-illustrated with photos showing techniques, stances, grips, etc. The intention of his techniques is to show you how to WIN with a blade, because losing in a knife fight is bad news indeed. While no book is a substitute for a visual presentation of better yet one-on-one instruction this is certainly a good start."
5,A Blessing In Disguise,"I, like most, was expecting a similar offering as the first project 'Metamorphasis', so I listened to other CD's I had for a while (not to hastily judge). I'm sooooo glad I did! Rarely does an artist offer such a diverse departure from his previous offering. If you like 'Not A Slave' video for this CD, you may experience shock with the mellow sounds of CD #1... or vice versa in my case. Both CD's are exceptional and totally different! This CD is not ""easy beats"" and you can't compatmentalize 'Life by Stereo' as something similar you heard before. I love all CMR product offerings and for JR not to be a rapper, but a musician is a pleasant diversifying factor. It blazes the trail (as CMR did for Christian rap) to cause other artists to step it up! I bought two of the last CD's for others and bought 1 of these as a gift to show there is a Christian altervative to secular R&B. If you appreciate all music in general -- Christian Rock, Rap, & R&B... this is a must own!!!"
1,Do not buy this vacuum! It's a piece of junk!,"We got this vacuum as a gift at our wedding shower. I didn't know much about vacuums when I did my registry online and so I added this one to my registry. We had this vacuum for a year (used it about once a month if that) and then when we bought our house we started to need it more but it decided to stop working. Hubby took it apart because there was no suction and couldn't find anything wrong with it. He put it back together and still no suction. Right now it's sitting in my basement since it's practically new but soon it'll be going to the dump. Very hard to clean. Filter is ALWAYS clogged. Basically, this is a piece of junk!!!!"
2,Were can I buy a belt?,"We bought a scratch and dent Shark bagless vacuum EP708.Where can I buy belt for this lame machine?The belt broke recently, and they are very hard to find in the stores.It also seems to clog the filter after just a few of uses.I clean it out and try to reuse it, but it really doesn't work that well.After fighting with it for a couple of months. I am looking at a new filter...A new filter, $30 bucks?The vacuum is only $99 new. It seems kind of expensive.I would suggest looking around.Todd"
1,Too much experience with this vacuum,"I bought my first Shark EP708 from JC Penneys.... in a month it had kept overheating... called the company and they were going to pick up the old one and repair it. I complained at paying the postage to get their defective machine back to them for repairs.... they sent a new one and picked up the old one at their costs..... new one has worked well for 1 1/2 months (although a mess to empty), then the rotary belt broke. That's why I'm on the internet now... trying to find a new one....can't find one locally... found one on the company website... $15.00 + s&h, and includes bulbs that I don't need.... think I'll forget it and buy a Hoover!"
5,Totally Awesome!!!!!!!!!!,This may be the best television series that I have ever watched. Hard to believe this series didn't get the recognition it deserved! Totally awesome series and highly recommened!!!!!!!!!
4,Excellent Series,"This show was cancelled half way through its first season run in 2006. Luckily for us, the first season had been completed at the time of its cancellation, and so at least there was one continuous story line for release on DVD.Don't let its cancellation put you off, though, because that has more to do with the idiocy of television executives, than the quality of this show, which is top notch."
2,Tempo and phrasing,"Many of the selections on this CD are performed at painfully slow tempos. Very slow tempos are a challenge. They require nuanced expression and judicious use, which is lacking in these pieces.Included with the CD are very interesting notes about the Historic churches of Nantucket Island and their Organs. The pictures that accompany the notes show the diversity of the organs and if one has the patience to listen to the CD, one could probably pick out their musical differences also."
3,sound good - holder poor,We really like the quality of the sound and that makes it worth the hassle of the following two items. The holder for the XM would not grasp it hard enough to hold it in place. Any little bump or movement would cause the radio to drop down. My husband fixed this by getting Velcro and now it holds fine. The indoor antenna was a disappointment as an extra antenna was needed but I should honestly mention that the additional antenna did not work in the house either. It (the antenna) has to be put outdoors to get reception. We did not try the sportScaster outdoors with just its own built-in antenna so cannot give an opinion on that.
1,Doesn't work now,"It was tempremental when I first started using it. Sometimes it would work, other times not. Then the volume range decreased and I wasn't able to turn it up very loud. Tried changing the batteries, using the A/C adaptor, but that didn't help. Now I can't get any sound out of it at all, but I'll keep playing with it and see if I can get it fixed. Too bad. I use it for my XM radio MP3 and it's hard to find inexpensive boom boxes for MP3s"
4,Misleading Packaging... FYI,"So I bought a gamecube memory card because my old one I've had for years finally went corrupt. This product works great... The thing is it is a ""Gamecube Memory Card"" The packaging reads ""Wii memory card, compatible with wii games"" and that is absolutely 150% NOT true... Older Wii's allow for backwards compatibility with the Gamecube and in order to save gamecube games you need a gamecube memory card, which is what this product is... YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SAVE WII GAMES ON THIS MEMORY CARD. This is a gamecube memory card labeled ""Wii Compatible memory card"" A Wii memory card is a SD card. So This product met my expectations, I found that the packaging was incredibly inaccurate and as a gamer I would like to warn parents who may be purchasing this product for the wii..."
5,64 megabytes of awesome!,"If you're looking for a high-capacity Gamecube memory card at a wallet-friendly price, look no further than here. When i received the card, it came as a white, generic card, but that's okay since I won't be seeing the label that often. Since it is white, it can be labelled with any color marker or paint. Works with all older Wiis and all Gamecubes."
2,"cheap set, poor quality","I got the package out in defect -- the bag's zipper was damaged. I was thinking return the item since it looks cheap and in poor quality as well, but my daughter wants those car sets. So I requested a replacement. However, the car parts are easily fallen off, and that is one of my worst purchases..."
5,Fashizzle Dizzle,I've been a fan of The Boondocks since it's newspaper syndication and I hope it runs forever.
5,This author is phenomenal,"I heard this author interviewed on Sirius Wisdom Radio(Living Successfully) the other day along with her husband(she did most of the talking).She sounded like the one of the most dynamic,positive ,sweetest,motivational people I have ever heard speak. I cant wait to get ahold of this book or anything else she writes in the future.Great job Mary Anne!"
1,"Worst Vacuum Ever? Well, maybe not....","Clogs too easy - must disassemble. Melts through belts on average of two uses. You'll spend about 20 minutes of down time to bring the thing back in order. I'm considering putting a small amount heat resistant electrical tape around the driveshaft where the belt comes in contact. Hopefully that may slow down the need to change belts. ---UPDATE--- The electrical tape trick actually works, and seems to run much better, So I've upgraded the performance to 3 STARS."
3,NOT A RAMOS,"IN THIS AD IT HAS A RAMOS 600M PICTURED ,BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT I RECIEVED . MINE WAS CALLED ENANX AND HAD NOWHERE ON IT WRITTER RAMOS IT COMES WITH A WRIST STRAP WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONNECT TO THE UNIT FOR THERE ARE NO HOLES OR SLIP SPOTS .PROS... THE SCREEN IS BEAUTIFUL AND IT WORKS FAST FROM COMPUTER TO UNIT VERY FAST ALSO NAVIGATING IT ONCE YOU FIGURE OUT THE BUTTON PATTERN IS ALSO A BREEZE. THE SOUND IS GREAT ALTHOUGH THE EARBUDS ARE KINDA CHEESY BUT THEY WORK . INCLUDED SOFTWARE MAKES ANY MOVIE FIT AND PLAY AND LOOK GREAT . ALL IN ALL A GREAT LITTLE PLAYER . BUT WHY SHOW A PICTURE OF THE RAMOS 600M WHAN THIS IS CLEARLY A COPY A GOOD COPY NONE THE LESS BUT STILL NOT GENUINE ..."
1,Confused!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This product was great when I first got it. Everything worked fine. It is easy to operate and downloading music to it is a snap. After about a week, I noticed that battery life started to get shorter and shorter. Also when I recharge it, the mp3 player will be saying that is completely charge but when I would try to use it the charge will drop to halfway charged. I tried three different chargers and it still does the same thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I could send it back I would because I am tired of having to constantly recharge this thing!!!!!!!!!"
2,Bath Mat,"I sent this mat back. It was not comfortable, not long enough and where the heck do you store it when you are done. It took 2 days of draining before I could package it back up. Great place for bacteria to grow. Ugh. Plus if you have a short tub, you can't begin to get covered with water with this sitting in your tub. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Not Like Old Fantoms At All,"I haved tried several types of Euro Pro Vacuums (hand-held's, small portables. etc.) and everyone of them is cheaply made, doesn't last, and not worth the money. I've had Fantoms is the past and loved them. Since Euro Pro bought out Fantom the quality went down the [sewer.] The biggest problem is the filter and dust container design. The dust container is triangular and the inner filter is round. As soon as dust starts to accumulate it can't freely move in the dust container requiring it to be emptied (very frequently) due to sudden loss in suction power. Spinning the filter to clean does not completely remove the dust from the filter screen. I have to use an old toothbrush to remove the dust. Very messy. Very disappointed with product and Euro Pro. I will never buy any type of appliance from Euro Pro again."
3,good for the parks only,"The detail for the parks is really good although not all parks are shown such as several state parks in my state are missing. But I suppose that is to be expected with a National Park edition. As usual with Garmin map products, if you look at other than the parks some streets will just not be there or only partially.Not all trails are shown either in the Parks."
3,MapSource Topo for East National Parks,"Before you buy, make sure it covers the area you are expecting. It's narrower than I was expecting, and therefore it's a little pricey. the parks it covers, it does quite well."
3,Material too soft,"I haven't actually put this to use yet but the material is softer than I expected and I am not sure that it will be that useful. It will probably not grip the item firmly enough to work efficiently. I have other jaws inserts for my Wilton that I use for various jobs. I have rubber, felt, aluminum and fiber inserts that I use for various types of jobs. These were made by Wilton and are very good, but I don't think that they are available anymore."
3,Zippered Vinyl Mattress Protector--Full Size,"This mattress protector is not heavy duty...it ripped at the zipper while being put on the mattress for the very first time. It will serve the purpose of a light-weight cover, but that is it. I work in a hospital, and it is definitely NOT hospital-grade."
4,Mattris cover,Was what I expected at a very good price. would be great to have a very heavy duty vinyl cover that wont rip easily at a reasonable price. ty
1,Broke putting on for first time,The zipper separated from the vinyl while putting it on the mattress for the first time. Horrible product but not worth the trouble of returning.
4,Does exactly what I need,"I bought this cover for my 4-year old daughter's mattress. It fits great and it's durable. It has already saved me from having to scrub urine and vomit out of the mattress, and it wipes clean very easily. While it's not a perfect product, it does exactly what is required for the price. I was wary because so many others said the plastic has an unbearable odor, but it's really no worse than a brand new shower curtain and it only took about a day before it aired out enough that I could no longer smell it."
5,Great!,"These labels stick, don't seem to curl in humidity, and the ink doesn't rub off. Far superior to the paper ones. I'm sold!"
1,A waste of good trees,"The old addage; ""consider the source..."" has never been truer. It rankles me, a chiropractor, to see this trash in print. Especially from this author. Since he published his own work, I suppose we could also blame the publisher for an amazing lack of editorial judgment. Rondberg has been convicted of election campaign fraud. He's also a known adulterer, has committed perjury, and is a known scam artist. Amongst his chiropractic ""brethren"" he has become a joke. The outrageous behavior of this classic narcissist would actually MAKE an excellent book, though non-fiction this odious would likely not be believed by most readers. I would not believe the opinion of this very flawed human being if he told me the sun were shining at mid-day. As to issues raised in the book, they are unoriginal, uninteresting, and explained at a 1st grade level. Which, coincidentally, is the intelligence level of the author."
2,A very frustrated read and waste of time,"Mr. Friedman's first book, ""Reasonable Doubt"" was quite promising, but his second one, ""Inadmissable Evidence"" turned out to be a blabbling torture, yet regretfully even further, the ""Grand Jury"", his 3rd book, has become so frustatively bored when you tried to read along. At first, it looked quite interesting and promising, but then, it lost its steam in the later pages of the first part. I've struggle a lot trying to read on, but became so mad against those main and/or supporting characters. You know what I did finally? I tore up the paperback in half and threw it to the bedside floor! A total 690 pages blah, blah, blah, and it should be shrunk at least 250 pages, and then, it might become more readable and not so frustrated."
5,Awesome performance of an awsome piece!,"Mars and Jupiter are part of our marching band show this year (yes, I'm only in high school). I have been a fan of classical for quite some time now, ever since I heard Pachelbel's Canon when I was eight years old. Anyway, I've been searching for a recording of The Planets for quite some time, but to no avail. I gave up a year or so ago. However, when our director announced that we would be playing the above-mentioned pieces as part of our show, it renewed a spark to find it. Eventually, I went here. I love the entire suite--Jupiter is so beautiful, as is Mercury. One of the best recordings of any piece I've ever heard."
3,HIGH HEAT-NOT SO HOT,I received my toaster oven in perfect condition. I bought it to broil big pieces of toast that are too big for my regular toaster. I use it every day. The heating elements never get 'red' hot when toasting on highest setting. The thing does toast my bread but probably takes twice as long as it should. I haven't used the rotisserie because I don't want to clean up the splatter and all the small parts.
1,DID NOT SEND WHAT I ORDERED,"HAD TO SEND IT BACK IT WAS NOT WHAT I ORDERED .SELLER DID NOT EVEN ANSWER MY E-MAIL AND STILL OWES ME FOR MY SHIPPING COST , HOW EVER AMAZOM REMBURSTED MY ACCOUNT VERY FAST."
2,WESTBRAE GREEN BEAN,BEANS NOT PROPERLY PREPARED. TO MANY STRINGS IN THEM. IT IS ON THE BACK OF THE BEAN MUST BE REMOVED.
4,Entertaining,"An entertaining movie, with enjoyable English humor.""What are you up to, old chap?""""Absolutely nothing.""""Well don't let it get the better of you.""Unfortunately the Nazis were all properly English rather than sadistic Germans & spoke proper English too, including Leslie Howard (whom I was introduced toas as a boy in ""Pygmalion"" & have adnired & respected ever since). Howard, as ""Herr Bodenschatz"" brazenly went into the German HQ & he too was clearly identifiable as himself - using Howard mannerisms in playing his undercover role. But the movie, though quite long, was as I said at the outset was entertaining & well worth viewing.."
1,Not worth the money,This book is useless. It has no helpful information on how to wire up any 12 volt device. All this book does is explain the different parts of an electrical system and nothing else besides that. If your looking for a book that at least has wiring diagrams for 12 volt systems then I would suggest that look for a better book.
3,"Somewhat misleading, but decent price either way","Apparentely I didn't read the first guy's review before I purchased these cables because the same thing happened to me. I think I actually saw where it said ""heavy duty copper plated steel clamps"" and was just thinking heavy duty everything. So although I falsely assumed, it was somewhat misleading at the same time. It's not exactly what I was wanting, but I'm not unhappy enough to return them; I didn't pay a lot for them. Read the reviews and carefully read the fine print!!! Know what you're looking for; all specifications!!!"
5,Husband loves it,My Husband and I have owned several deep fryers and this one is the best. He loves it so much. wants to fry something everyday. Highly recommend.
3,Electronics Failure,"The Euro-Pro fried excellently and the electronic panel was very easy to use. But after 3 months, the electronic panel failed and it rendered the fryer useless."
4,great but missing Christmas episode,"I thought it was the complete series but there is a Christmas episode that does not appear to be in here. Otherwise, great!"
5,beautiful treasure in my hands,inspiring to learn before a trip to visit the masterpiece of these artists.once you see it you can appreciate and hunger for more.
1,Toaster of the Future,"In other words, your toast/grilled food will be done sometime in the distant future. Takes forever to heat, and does not attain the kinds of radiant temps that even a cheapie Black & Decker does. I don't have any sense that the convection feature does anything at all except make noise. Let's put it this way: my gas oven heats more quickly and cooks faster than this thing, and I've basically stopped using the Euro Pro, will put it out on the street as soon as I find a replacement."
1,utter rubbish,"Having read a lot of conspiracy theories over the last few years I can say without a doubt that this is probably one of the worst books I have ever read. Whilst some books create tenuous links supported by few actual facts, this author invents facts all on his own and then presents them as empirical research. I have no doubt that Mr Byrne has had an interesting time researching this book, and (as others have mentioned) there are some items of historical note presented in a highly readable way, this book should be taken no more seriously than Dan Brown - and has about as much a basis in fact as the aforementioned authors own books.In short, if this was sold as a work of fiction then it would be reasonably entertaining, as a conspiracy theory book it borders on lunacy, and considering it as a work of research should result in someone being incarcerated."
4,"Old ""skool"" Kung fu!!","I gave this flick 4 stars because it deserves it. I had the opportunity to view this flick in it's entirety. I must admit I started watching not expecting too much, but I was pleasantly surprized. The fight scenes were immense, and intense. The DVD transfer was pretty good. The story/ plot very transparent and easy to follow. I refuse to give too much details of this flick, it's worth cheching out,,you will not be dissapoinment!!"
3,Needs more character development,"I really like the author's style, but I do not feel that she fully develops her characters in this book. I believe that some of the scenes that occur happen a bit too fast, and there is not enough growth and development of the protagonist before he is mortally challenged and defeats some of his obstacles. Some of the premises about serial killers and their origins are a little out there, and I think that this book gets a little graphic and disgusting when discussing the childhood of one of the Vargr. I find it unbeliev able that a wimpy outcast has so few incidences where he shows his strength and power before he becomes so strong. I believe that this book is worth reading, but it would have been better if some of the basic premises were altered and the characters were more fully developed."
4,"Super Loud, Short Cord, No Hands","My family jokes that I could sleep through a nuclear blast, but this alarm clock really does the trick. It's super loud and changing the pitch really makes a difference. The lights don't do anything for me though. The best part is the vibrating disc. I tuck in inside my pillow; it's not too jarring, but still wakes me up. It also works, although not as well for me, under the mattress. There are two reasons I gave it 4 stars rather than 5. The first is that the cord for the vibrator (insert joke here) is not long enough. I am the sort of person that smacks the snooze or off button and goes back to sleep without even realizing it. I need to keep the clock across the room, so I was forced to buy the $11 extension cord. Also, the image on the site is of an analog clock (with hands), which I thought was really groovy. I was disappointed when it showed up and was just a regular old digital clock, but not disappointed enough to send it back."
5,Sonic Boom,"I bought this for my in-laws on-line at their request. They absolutely love it, and had me order a second for their vacation home. It works great for my mother-in-law who has very poor hearing. They are very sensitive about aesthetics, and like the look."
4,Exactly What I Was Looking For,"Received this product promptly, the vibrating function is very effective. I assume the clock gets very loud... I have the noise setting turned to the lowest setting and still it is more than enough to wake me effectively. This isn't the standard alarm clock beep but rather a unique wailing siren... not quite as annoying as I make it sound but certainly a startling noise. Anything louder and I'd be waking up scared senseless, and as it is the effect is enough to provide my cat quite a shock each morning.Well worth the money, great product. My only gripe is that the product featured in the image on this page is NOT the clock being sold. Although the specs are correct, the clock has a digital display and not the traditional analog arms shown in the picture.Buy with confidence."
5,Wow! This'll knock you out of bed!!,"Now this is one great clock. The first night I used it, I was about knocked out of bed, and I did not have the bed shaker even plugged in.I like the large numbers so when I do wake up at night, I can clearly see what time it is.When the alarm goes off, the lights start flashing, it is impossible not to pay attention to it.I highly recommend this product."
4,"Great game, fast delivery!","This is a great game. Unique and fun to see if you and your teamate are ""compatible"". Match pictured cards with terms that are drawn and see if you and your teammate picked the same picture!Seller was prompt on delivering my item. Appreciated that. I got in less than a week and only chose normal delivery.Game was used, but ""like new"". Only complaint is that everything was a mess inside the box....like someone just took all the cards and pieces and threw them in there. But nothing was missing and it was fairly easy to organize and get back to normal."
2,Not the Best,"I love Basia, but I did not like this CD. It just did not pull me in like Time & Tide did. I was disappointed."
5,Basiophile,"I became acquainted with Basia via her work on Spyro Gyra's ""Got the Magic"" and have become a fan. Her voice is somewhat reminiscent of Gloria Estefan, only sweeter, richer and more flexible. ""London Warsaw New York"" showcases her gifts very well and merits a place in every jazz audiophile's collection."
5,"If possible, I think I love this more than my children do","My kids have read the covers off this book. Between the magical storyline, the lovable narrator, the comfortable Harvey Potter himself, and the down-home-good-old-America town setting, this book is a winner.But for me, it's all about the hidden pictures. It's worth memorizing the story so you can ""read"" it out loud while you grab a couple more minutes of searching the pages -- get a head start on your kids.Great, great book -- great for the imagination, and great for the spirit."
4,Another winner by Joseph Finder,"Joseph Finder is, simply put, a GREAT author.This is the second book I've read by him, and I continue to be impressed. I found myself wrapped up in High Crimes from the very beginning.OK, it seemed a little bit like an episode of JAG and A Few Good Men, but it was still really good.Do yourself a favor and discover Joseph Finder."
4,"Good, but....","Ok, this cd is really good. It has all the elements that you'd expect from tfk. Catchiness, good sounding, fun lyrics. The only thing I had a problem with was that I didn't have that ""feeling"" that I had when I first heard phenomenon. Probably because phenomonen was so much better and different than set it off. But now we already know what to expect from them so its not as surprising. The music itself is great, but the ""feeling"" is gone."
2,A letdown and a half,"Simply put, this cd blows. I didnt give it one star because the last song sounds like old TFK kinda like This Is A Call, and that's the only saving grace of the cd. Set It off weilded some of the greatest slow rock songs ever (Small Town, Brother John, etc..) and Phenomenon was well known for the straight up hard rockin jams. This cd, had it been as good as it should have been, had the potential to set these guys to Nirvana-like status because the first two were so awesome, but this is crap. I looked forward to this cd for MONTHS when I heard it was coming out and now that it's here I could care less...what a letdown. Tooth & Nail shouldn't have let this cd happen unless some effort was going to be put into it. If you're a TFK fan download the last song and forget the rest."
2,What Happened?!?!,"Where is the up-beat hope-filled hard rock/rap TFK were used to? Instead this is a venom spraying subliminal mess of try-to-be Christian rock. I mean song number nine is kind of a mess of something that is not what I would call Christian at all (it had promise but the mainstream would say something different). I hope that they get back to their base, grab hold of their Christian roots, and rock for Christ!"
5,still a delight after all these years,"This 3 dvd box set offers a lot of value for a small price. I found the colorization about the best Ive ever seen - so detailed you might mistake it for early Technicolor - and if you are an avid opponent of colorization, the black and white original are all there tooBe aware these shorts are often not politically correct especially in the portrayal of African-Americans but they accurately reflect the mores of the 30s..."
3,sheger is alright,"was ok movie, got what i expected and was surprised it had arrived so quick so damn cheap too !"
5,Fantastic,True to it's repetition these speakers are fantastic. The sound was great and the first time hearing it was a joy. I would highly recommend this to anyone.
4,Apex DM 317 Awesome slim case,"Excellent appearance. This case is very stable small and quite .The fan on the side /topis nice feature if you are going to stand your case and the large vent being over the cpu was abig plus for me . I managed to fit MadDog 18X DVD burner ,black ide,Xigmatec Apache cpu cooler,AMD Athlon X2 BE-2400 Brisbane cpu,WD 500gb hard drive sata,Crucial ddr2 800 and Gigabyte GA-MA78GM-S2h AM2 AMD 780g HDMImicro-atx motherboard. This case is identical to Antec Minuet Case. The interior well designed and provide enough lenght and cabling for almost motherboard.The power supply is enough power to supply my system and has stable power. The case has good airflow. I used this case is perhapps one of the best case bang for your bucks, I've seen in a small form slim case."
3,Worst sound track ever,"This movie has the most grating, irritating and obnoxious sound track I have ever heard . Kinda of like listening to the sound track of a used car commercial for 2 hours. Other than that, I'd give it three stars."
5,Awsome,Not as good as Hustling with the Godmother but pretty awesome. It's on my top 100 list. I don't see it coming off that list for a long time. Highly recommended.
5,"Two straws up!! A must see, I highly recommend it!","""Cocaine Cowboys"" is an excellent documentary; realistically portraying the growth of the drug trade during the 80's & 90's dominated by the Colombian Mafia. It also shows how ""cocaine cash"" made the city of Miami, and to some extent the State of Florida what it is today. It is reality `Scarface' exploring and explaining the details of how the drug trade exploded in Dade County and its migration to Southern California. The interviews with reporters, police officials, hit men, and drug dealers provide a very real picture of the madness, murder and money that are an inherent part of the illicit drug trade. There are some very graphic scenes, but that' was reality in Dade County during the era.The DVD also includes: 24 deleted scenes; with or without commentary by the director and the co-producer; The Charles Cosby Story ""Hustlin' with the Godmother"" including her plan to kidnap JFK Jr.Two straws up!! A must see, I highly recommend it!"
5,Awesome awesome movie,This is a great documentary on the cocaine trade in Miami. It was awesome to hear the people who were actually involved in it and what their thoughts on it were. A must buy... End of story.
4,Good stuff,"This was a good documentary. I live in miami, so it was cool to see how much this city has changed. By the time i got here in 1990 the cocaine cowboy thing was over. So i did not know too much about this. It crazy to know there were shootouts in malls ive been going to since i was younger, like dadeland mall which looks very different now and the mall of the americas (pan american mall in the early 80's). Overall this was entertaining even at 2 hours it doesnt bore you. i recommend it especially if you live in miami."
5,Very good documentary,This documentary gives you a glimpse of the drug problem back in the late seventies and early eighties in Florida
3,Does what it is supposed to - could use improvement.,"I had one of these years ago and I remember the lid fit snugly and the plunger would scrape the bottom of the pitcher. I was disappointed to receive this and fit the lid just spins and easily pulls out of the pitcher as you are mixing, and the plunger does not scrape the bottom. It does what it is supposed to, but could really use some improvement. Especially for $10."
4,Works as Advertised!,"Silly me, ended up paying more for the S&H than for the Pitcher itself. I simply do not like it when I do this kind of transaction. I should have read the fine print but as far as the Pitcher is concerned I am very pleased. Looks good and it is perfect for mixing drinks inside. Fits on the side of the refrigerator and now I wish I would have bought 2 instead of 1. Unless, of course, the Shipping charges would have cost double. I think this Pitcher cost around $4.00 - $5.00 and the S&H cost $6.95. Wouldn't it be nice if everything Amazon sold would have the option of Free S&H for purchases over $25.00? Let me tell you this: there would be no ending of purchases! After is all said and done Rubbermaid Servin Saver White Mixing Pitcher 2 Qt. gets a well deserved 4 Stars rating."
4,Does the job!,"This pitcher works great to mix frozen drinks with water (that you buy in the freezer aisle at your grocery store)... as well as powder mixes. When mixing, the handle sticks a bit when its all the way down but not a huge problem. I bought 2 of these and would buy again!"
4,Does the job,"Holds my Kool-aid and stirs it up, but the fingers would be better if they were more ridged. For the price, you can't beat it."
2,Bad plastic,The plunger is a good idea. The different elements are made of different plastics and I cannot be sure they are safe. Especially if my kids' drinks are going to be contained in there for days. It seems to be an older model that is not labeled as being made of safe plastics. I returned it and got a glass jug and will mix our drinks with a wooden spoon.
1,CHEAP!,Don't waste your money! Used only once and the mixer broke! So dissapointed in Rubbermaid! A trusted name until now!
1,Disappointed for being Rubbermaid,"I did not expect much for the price, but I expected better for being Rubbermaid. This is the quality you would get at the Dollar Store; plus, juice goes bad in it as the lid does not keep a tight enough fit to keep the juice fresh. Marylilly"
5,Hard to find tasty low sodium crackers,"When more and more seniors need low sodium products, the cracker manufacturers keep loading up the salt. The Rye and Oat Bran flavor of Ryvita easily has the lowest sodium in its class and tastes great. Don't miss the fruit and nut variety too."
1,I am soooooooooo not impressed,"At first I was real happy with this, but when I opened the case and started using it I realized how tiny this was. I could hardly fit my USB cable into it's pouch and if you put the ipod in the case that it came with and then into the travel case, it wouldn't really fit. The hole thing started falling apart after a few days and my ipod wouldn't stop falling out of the little lether so it got scatched alot. It's not really worth $30 to me. I suggest you do not buy it."
2,doesn't toast well,"If you're looking to toast bread---don't buy this. I have only gotten uneven results--too brown in spots, too dry--and I've tried every imaginable combination of settings. It says 4-slices but 4 don't fit well unless you overlap them. The ""broil"" setting is strange too--only the bottom coils light up. For baking it's fine though--it heats up quickly with no problems. And aesthetically it looks great on the counter."
4,"Good, but not his best","Having read O'Brien's ""The Things They Carried"" first, this book seemed a bit dry and journalistic in comparison. It started out slow, and never really pulled me in the way the other did. In this book there are flashes of O'Brien's lyrical, dream-like brilliance, but never as consistent or as seemingly tangible as in ""The Things They Carried.""In this book, O'Brien brings the reader along with him from the moment he first learns that he is to be drafted until he is on a plane heading home from Viet Nam. He shares his fears, doubts and political views of the war. The book is mostly about O'Brien's experience in the war, and how it changed him and matured him.Overall, a good book. Probably of particular interest to anyone interested in a personal, almost documentary-style account of O'Brien's experience in Viet Nam. In a purely literary sense, however, the stories in ""The Things They Carried"" are far better examples of Tim O'Brien's skill as a writer."
4,An Excellent Personal Account,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it as one of the best accounts of a tour of duty in Vietnam.Tim O' Brien spent a year in Vietnam in 1969 and this is his account of that year. He subsequently wrote two highly acclaimed Vietnam novels,Going After CacciatoandThe Things They Carriedboth of which I also enjoyed and would recommend. But ""If I Die in a Combat Zone"" was, for me, more powerful and moving. Quite possibly as relevant today as it was on publication in 1973. Read it."
1,Another Tim O'Brien sham,Another book that is written like hearing a narrative. I would not recommend this bok for any reader.
4,"If it had subtitles, five stars!","This is a gorgeous production of Der Rosenkavalier with beautiful music, sets, costumes, performers and singing. It lacks only subtitles. I've seen five other productions of this opera (more than once), so I was able to follow the opera anyway, but subtitles truly add to the enjoyment. If this were to be your first viewing, I'd say choose another.Elizabeth Whitehouse as the Marschellin was regal and sang beautifully. Ildiko Komlosi was superb in the role of Octavian and Desiree Rancatore was a fabulous Sophie. Their duets with the rose were heavenly. Daniel Lewis Williams, who sang with a deep, rich bass voice, was perfectly obnoxious as Baron Ochs. The sword scene where he is grazed by Octavian was spectacularly chaotic.Act III at the inn was well done although a little light on the bedlam compared to other productions I've seen. I enjoyed the whole thing except for the last minute, which I will not describe. It seemed out of character."
3,"High camp, high class horses","Bo Derek plays Lida ""Mac"" MacGillivery, a virginal, nicely-bronzed, buff blonde in the roaring 1920s who's desperate to lose her virginity. Fortified with bags of cash, her trusty chauffer (George Kennedy), her best friend (Ana Obregon), a skimpy wardrobe and a healthy libido, Mac sets off for the hot desert nights of Arabia where she begins her erotic odyssey. She meets an opium-soaked sheik, a gyrating gypsy, and a lovely Latino bullfighter, but it's horses that win her heart as she rides bareback (in every sense of the word) on some of the most stunning Spanish horses you will ever see on film.Staci Layne Wilson"
3,Didn't work for me,"After a lot of research I went with this over the traditional. I found from day one my body to have adverse reactions. I gave it a week but I become itchy within 30mins each time of taking this. My heart also seems to race a bit. Of course with any supplement, this is my experience and it may not do that to you. My main reason was for general nerve pain and other benefits. It didn't seem to have any effect on that but perhaps it would need longer. I'm going to try another brand to see if I do not have a reaction."
4,Very Solid Effort,"This album is really quite good. Some people hate it, but in my opinion most of the songs are listenable and five are excellent. These standouts are Mixed Emotions, Hearts for Sale, Can't Be Seen, Rock and a Hard Place, and Continental Drift. Any album with five great songs should be highly regarded, and the rest of the songs certainly aren't bad. Overall, this album is a slight step below Tattoo You but it's leaps and bounds above other latter day Stones albums (like Voodoo Lounge and Bridges to Babylon). Stones fans should definitely get this."
1,piece of junk..,"Had this Europro unit. Worked five or six times, then the element quit working. Got a complete replacement. It, too, quit after half a dozen uses. Called the phone number, got someone to send a replacement element. (They wanted to charge thirty bucks shipping, but I had to talk them out of that.) New element lasted half a dozen more times, then quit.Picked up a Presto CoolDaddy for $29.99. Works great, and only a third of the price."
1,Great buy if you like throwing your money away,"I have purchased 2 of these from Amazon, neither worked. I tried buying them from Bed Bath & Beyond, neither worked. This is a horrible company. There fryers are delivered non-working, there sweepers are bad and get recalled if they didnt catch fire. Very poor product development. Better off buying T-Fal."
1,Stopped working...,"Like another reviewer I had the same problem with my Euro-Pro Fryer. After about a year of use in which the device was used about eight times it simplly stopped working. The design and ease of use is great but it seems that ""Made in China"" strikes again and the fryer is not made to last."
2,Yes IT cooked great for about 9 months,"I used this fryer about 15 times in the 9 months I had it. Then last time I tried to use it It kicked the breaker off,I reset the breaker but the fryer was toast. I thought I bought a great fryer for $90 but I guess I just rented it for 9 months @ $10 a month. I don't think I will try another one"
1,DONT BUY THIS,BOUGHT THIS AND IT HASN'T WORKED YET. CALLED 800 # REACHED INDIA AND COULD HARDLY UNDERSTAND REP.UNIT HEATS FOR ABOUT 45 SECONDS THEN QUITS. DOESN'T RESTART. PRESSED RESET BUTTON TO NO AVAIL.CANNOT GET RESULTS FROM ANYONE.WISH I HAD NEVER BOUGHT IT.GO TO A RESTAURANT. IT'S LESS MESSY.
3,Good Value,"A pretty good vise for the money. It has a useful dog and OK construction. I don't like the fact that it must be cranked open and closed (no quick release). And, it is a little on the small side. But, like I said, It's a good value."
1,extremely poor quality,"We were immediately disappointed when we first even tried to unfold this cover. It tore when pulled with the least bit of pressure when just trying to unwrap it. By the time we had it on the mattress, all corners were torn and the zipper was completely torn apart. We were careful to order the right size including the depth but still could not manage to apply this cover without alot of damage. The ad said it was 6 gauge but we have since received another 6 gauge cover that is much thicker vinyl."
1,"Very thin, rips easily","This will not hold up with a 3 to 4 year old. Bought this for my son, and it has ripped in so many places! It did rip a little when I put it on and zipped it, but I just assumed it was going to be a problem at the seam. It's not. It ripped right down the middle where I needed it to hold up. Spend more for a better product."
1,not worth the money at all,"when i questioned both amazon and the seller directly about what ""6 gauge"" meant, neither could answer. the seller said that its thicker than the 3 gauge and almost all of their customers are happy with it. i figured i would give it a go anyway and ordered it. initially, after taking it out of the package i first noticed that it wasn't sealed along the zipper seam. i haven't even put it on the bed yet and its not staying attached to the zipper. secondly, it doesn't appear to be any thicker than the $10 protectors you can buy at walmart. if it is thicker, it isn't by much at all."
1,Waste of time & money,"There should be a rating of zero stars. This item is poorly constructed of weak material. The seams open up, the vinyl tears easily, and the thing is too small for a standard queen mattress. There's nothing good to say about it."
1,received damage and can not return..tear easyly,i order 4 queen size mattress covers. one of them was already damage in packing and one get tear of while we putting on. no good product..n it make noice while u sleep on bed..
5,Good Old Fashioned Values and very entertaining.,"My nearly three year old loves this video...has many of the lines memorized. She loves Goliath's excitement at getting a new dog house (and that he wants it to have an elevator), and I like the values it teaches kids: that you can do your best, and not rely on others all the time for help."
4,Great Product,"Very accurate thermometer, easy to read and has great mounting options on my Road King. Very nice addition to my touring gear."
4,The History of Jazz,"It's all here (hear): field hollers to blues to New Orleans jazz to swing & be-bop to jazz right now. It's all here, all rolled into one great CD. Stumbled over this when it first came out. I was amazed!: B.B. King, John Lee Hooker with the Brandford Marsalis band - oh hell yes! I bought it and have adored it ever since.If you like blues. Buy this. If you like jazz. Buy this. Cause this is history right here (hear)."
3,Okay,"Well, I got it 8 months ago, It sounds fine, but its definetly worth saving more money and buying a different china, this one is highly over priced."
5,"Provocative, pathbreaking scholarship","The Culture of Citizenship is provocative, path-breaking scholarship. In it, Thomas Bridges presents liberal political philosophy as in retreat from its traditional confidence in the 'modernist rhetoric of pure theory.' Instead, Bridges argues, figures such as John Rawls are inching toward a 'rhetorical turn' toward context, culture and history, a direction this book seeks to accelerate. To this end, the book explores the often surprising and deeply challenging implications this rhetorical turn holds for the philosophy of politics and culture."
4,35 Year Old Male Reads Book - Admits Issues,"This is informative, full of facts and examples, but tends to run in circles and is too lengthy. Finishing the book helped me understand my emotions like the South Beach Diet helped me understand my appetite."
5,Great selection - A must have,"What a pleasure to listen to this CD. The songs are enchanting, and as always, very well chosen by Putumayo.I was not familiar with this style of Italian music - very different from Italian pop - but it is very easy to appreciate and get addicted to. You could really tell the influence of traditional values on the songs: the music, the singers' voices, etc.Authentic Italian, strongly recommend it."
4,Hulbut's Story of the Bible,"This collection of Bible stories puts into layman's terms what is happening in the Bible. On the front cover of this paperback edition the author explains his purpose which is to tell the Bible stories. There is no moralizing, no theology, just the stories that people have already heard, but may not fully comprehend.This collection covers the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation. The readings are not difficult as most stories are told in three pages of text or less. Hurlbut has the ability to simplify and make the stories understandable for those who have a tough time grasping the Bible as literature."
2,"Great Brush, Terrible Battery","This is the third Interplak product I've owned. I've always been very pleased by how well the extra-soft bristles cleaned beneath the gum line. This design is also great for people who travel. It easily fits in your bag without a bulky extension cord. However, the battery quality is terrible. My first Interplak lasted several years. The second one lasted almost two years. This one barely made it six months before the battery stopped holding a charge. If you want your teeth really clean, this brush is for you. Just expect to replace it often."
1,Garbage,"I purchased a ""Factory Reconditioned Euro Pro KP170E Electronic Ice Cream Maker"". It was delivered broken. I notified the manufacture and arranged to have it replaced by one that did work. When the new unit arrived, it to was broken. I am still looking for a ice cream machine, just not a ""EURO PRO"""
1,What a shame and a waste. . .,"As valuable as many of our ""heritage films"" have proven themselves to be, it's a real crime to allow a second (or in this case, THIRD) rate video producer to get their hands on them.Both ""Midnight"" (later released as ""Call it Murder"") and ""Beat the Devil"" as decent films in their own right, but this compilation DVD just needs to be burned, or at least banned. Compilations like this one are just another reason our appreciation of older films is in decay. I wouldn't drive a 58 Corvette if it were in this condition, I'm certainly not going to recommend such poor quality DVD reproductions of great movies.The video is aweful. The audio lags. Practically no special features.I STRONGLY URGE YOU NOT TO BUY THIS DVD OR ANY BY THE SAME COMPANY-"
2,Unimpressed,"I am a person with a possible diagnosis of Lupus, looking for information about the disease. While I found Dr. Wallace's handbook on Lupus very helpful, ""New Hope"" was full of silly platitutes and assumptions about my experiences of the disease (trying to be funny and sympathetic, but not mirroring my experiences at all--I found it rather condescending). It did not cover in depth alternative therapies as I had hoped."
2,Save your Money; read the book instead!,"Once again we see ""based on a true story"" at the beginning of the film. I do not see where Simon Murray had very much, if anything to do with this film. His character in the movie was portrayed as an idealistic wimp; the real Simon Murray was a very tough hombre. The book is an essay of the brutality within the Legion, which the film has great difficulty in bringing to the screen. The first half of Full Metal Jacket is far more effective and convincing in that respect. I have read Legionaire three times, and was hoping the movie would convey the spirit and events contained therin. It did not. This movie has about as much historical accuracy as Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"". Very little. Do not buy this DVD; buy the book and enjoy it as a descent into the Hell of joining the Legion."
2,Not Worth the Time,"I don't know if a lot of this film was left on the cutting room floor or what, but the movie just doesn't work.I might watch it again but only because I am in love with Tom Hardy. His character is the best one. You already know that my opinion is biased. The lead character just didn't do anything for me at all. I really can't see that character in the Legion. I really have to blame the actor, the casting person, and the script for this.The story could have been good, but I wound up getting people confused. I kept asking my friend who watched it with me, ""Is that the one girl or the other girl?"" Some things took too long to develop, and some story elements didn't develop at all."
2,Sappy War Story With Little Action,"The ""Deserter"" is a movie you should desert before you start. It's the story of a young Englishman named Murray who decides to join the Fr. Foreign Legion for fun and adventure like Erol Flynn. It turns out it's not a whole lot of fun. The story takes place in 1960. Murray is sent with his comrades to Algeria to suppress an Arab uprising. Don't look for any major battles--very little action. Murray ends up being conflicted--of course, the crisis of conscience plot. Spoiler alert--he kills his Foreign Legion buddy to protect Arabs who were taken hostage. Save your time, desert now and don't bother with the Deserter."
1,Extremely poor quality,"The zipper fell right off of the cover. I do not think that it was ever really attached. The quality of this product is non-existent and I find it difficult to believe that the seller is unaware of the quality issues with this product and that they continue to offer it for sale. When I called to complain the representative made it clear that the company did not care - ""just return it to Amazon."""
3,easily torn,"Delivery was about 24hrs, which was awesome! Though, the seams around the zipper was easily torn when I tried to zip it around my kids twin mattress. Nothing a little tape couldn't fix. I am ok with it."
1,Buyer beware,"Do not buy!this protector is thinner than a ziplock bag,ANDit does not fit a regular twin mattress.After multiple emails we still did not recieve a refund."
3,It's just okay,"Not very sturdy, ripped while putting it on the mattress, but will leave it on until the tears are unbearable."
4,Vinyl Mattress Protector,Previous products I used were of poor quality and fell apart quickly. When initially looking at this product it seemed to be heavier and better constructed. The set of covers I replaced had to be handled carefully and installed gently to avoid ripping them. Eventually they ripped just from every day usage. Installing this product did not require any special handling and so far it has held up well.
1,"More like 20 gauge, product is paper thin","Purchased this as a precaution. We've been hearing about bedbugs in our building and didn't want to take any chances. Much to our chagrin, the mattress protector didn't last an entire month; The seam ripped at the end of the mattress.The product description states ""6 gauge"" (which is 4mm or about 1/8"" thick), but it is closer to 20 gauge (the actual product is about as thick as cardstock). Imagine those emergency rain ponchos that can fit in your jeans back pocket. It's about as ""heavy duty"" as that.Backed by a 2 year warranty perhaps... but it will cost about as much to ship it back as to buy a new one. What a freaking ripoff. Take your money elsewhere."
4,World religions Jesus Camp Review,"Jesus Camp is a very interesting movie about children with parents that are very religious and want their children to be the same. Many don't believe in the idea of evolution and the big bang. Some parents home school their children because they don't want the school to teach them any of the evolution, big bang and even global warming. To me enforcing all of this is crazy but it isn't my choice. In the movie at the beginning there is a scene where the children are communicating with god and are and told to say what comes to min this is a bit weird in the sense that they go that far. Overall this was a good and very educational movie."
3,Passive Filmmaking,"Okay, the evangelical Pentecostal church brainwashes their children into believing the end of the world is just around the corner, that ""demonic possession"" is real, that speaking nonsense syllables is somehow significant, that President Bush is a godly man and that abortion is a religious, rather than a moral issue. I get all that.What bothered me about this film is that the filmmakers very carefully remained neutral, allowing both evangelicals and non-evangelicals to claim the film as their own. It would have been SO EASY -- and so right -- to demolish this sort of child abuse for the horror that it is."
1,Irresponsible representation of Christianity,This documentary is dangerous. It borders on cult like activity and shows children being forced to speak in tongues. Very disturbing.
1,EEEEEK CHRISTIANS!!!,"They're so scary. These poor kids are being brainwashed into believing that god exists. Furthermore, they'll grow up and vote for Republicans. I hope some great Democrat will take these poor children from their ignorant parents and send them to a school where they will be taught tolerance and responsibility towards mother earth.....In all seriousness, this was another agenda driven film meant to make Christians look bad. If you've seen one, you've seen them all."
1,"As of 6/6/2008, Directors' Commentary plays over regular audio for Unbox download","As of 6/6/2008, when I rented this film through Amazon Unbox for download to and viewing on my TiVo HD, the version of the film that Amazon is providing had the Directors' Commentary audio playing over the film's standard audio track, making the film essentially unwatchable. I assume Amazon must have made a mistake in preparing the film for the Unbox service. I asked Amazon to refund my rental."
1,Disturbing and Mental,"After an hour of chanting and seeing small children getting ""cleansed"" by bottled water, I had to turn this movie off. The fact that children were made to believe they were not Christians because they acted differently at school or may have done a mean deed was absolutely crazy. People have faults and children make mistakes and that doesnt make them less of a Christian or love God less. The woman who runs this camp sound like a mental who needs help and shame on her for using children to help her personal cause.As a Christian I found this documentary disturbing. I really cant believe there are that many people in the United States who attempt to brain wash their children. I have attended bible study camps which were about love and learning to enjoy life and have fun. This camp focused on making children feel that they are sinners and not worthy of Gods love.I hated this movie and dont recommend it."
4,tablets were better,"When I first started taking this multi-vitamin, I was very impressed. I was taking 2 ""tablets"" a day. I fealt great, and had a lot of energy. Then I switched to the ""capsule"" version, because I thought they should be exactly the same thing. I was wrong. I didn't feel as great, or have remotely as much energy at all. I will only take the ""tablet"" version of this product from now on."
1,Protective Seal Broken,"When I got them I took off the lid and the seal was already broken. I took a few pills out and they had small black spots on the inside of the plastic capsule. Also they smell disgusting, I'm not sure if that's due to the seal being broken or if they just smell bad regardless but the few capsules I touched made my hand smell bad long afterwards and I had to wash my hands a few times before it went away."
2,Not up to snuff,"The title promised potential, but unfortunately did not live up to Cornwell's historical fiction pedigree. Started off well enough, but quickly bogged down, much like the american's attack in the book. There was no real development of the characters, no real story line and no build up or climax to keep one turning the pages. The story just petered out and left me questioning Cornwells purpose in writing about what was evidently a virtual non event in American history. I'm hoping for better in Agincourt."
3,Go General George!,"Takes place during British occupation of Philadelphia. A nice balance of historical feel and fictional excitement, ""Redcoat"" is a bloody good read if your looking for some patriotic lit. with a little American drama."
2,"A Book with Good Characters, but an Uninteresting Plot","Redcoat is a novel depicting the consequences of war on a country and a family. It's full of (not necessarily interesting) detailed war scenes, and a variety of characters. Of all the characters, Martha Crowl is by far the most interesting. She's an independent widow who develops her own opinions and views based on her observations, and hers alone. This quality gets her into trouble later in the book. Jonathan Abel is another interesting character. He shows what it's like to live in a cruel, ridiculing world. I, personally, enjoyed the characters and life scenes in the book, but not the war settings or battles. They were often too detailed and lacked interesting appeal. If you're a war book junkie and enjoy battles and fighting, this is an excellent book for you. But, if you're more into reading about the positive aspects of the world, keep looking."
3,"A kinder, gentler Cornwell","One of the things that struck me about this book is that, in comparison to other Cornwell novels, it's almost a romance novel. Not that it doesn't have gory battle and corporal punishment scenes -- it certainly does -- but a romance is at the core of the plot. I almost wonder if the author was somehow inspired by his own marriage to an American. I found it interesting that the book focuses on the British army. Cornwell seems comfortable and fluent with his topic, although he doesn't explore some of the characters (Vane, especially) as much as he could. I know rather little about the period in question, and it would be interesting to know if the portrayal of the British army as both brutal and corrupt is accurate. If so, it would certainly help to explain their defeats."
3,"Nice, but...","...I was disappointed to find that the knives stain and even show rust spots when placed in the dishwasher.This is a nice set, lovely design-- but it is not for everyday, unless you choose to wash the knives by hand. Too high maintenance for my taste."
4,Army Nurses in WW2,"This is a movie made during WW2 (1943) as a boost to morale to the folks back home. It is the story of a group of Army Nurses in the Philippines and Corregidor who care for the wounded men from Bataan. Lots of interplay between the nurses and the wounded. Shows the stress these brave women were under during this time. Very good performances from Claudette Colbert, Veronica Lake, and Paulette Goddard. George Reeves (Superman) shows off his acting talents. Overall a very good film."
5,American universities: swindle of generaltional proportions?,"Alan Charles Kors and Harvey Silverglate have been defending students against the tyranny of thought and speech control on American campuses for nearly two decades.Now, with detail and evidence en masse, they are describe the frightening steps being taken on American campuses to effect the forced moral reeducation of students who violate left liberal dictates.Students and faculty alike face censure, reprimands, coerced re-education and, in some cases, expulsion for thought ""crimes"" ranging from shouting ""water buffalo"" at noisy students to criticizing minority fraternities.This book is a must-read for any American concerned about the future of liberty in the ""Land of the Free."
4,Black Leather Handbag,Nice tote bag - large inner area with outside pocket for things you want right away. Soft leather - great for traveling. Very stylish tote.
3,Not bad,Its not that bad of a book. Perhaps it was somewhat fast for my taste jumping from one person to another but its a simple read and can play much like a moive of you view it that way. If you like the thought of Vampires in the present and have no care for the many Kine (thats regular mortals like us for those who do not know) that suffer and like a side bit of lesbianism (nothing too explict but makes you think) this is something that i can recommend.
2,Can not get parts,I purchased the Shark about 7 months ago and the plastic handle broke a short time later. I ordered two new handles because the handles seem to be very weak in December 2003. They charged my credit card. I have waited since then without receiving the handles. I have called the customer assistance center on multiple times. They have sent me post cards saying that my parts are still on back order. It's hard to believe that the company can't produce simple spare parts but it seems to be the case. I am now totally frustrated and the have my money.PLease be on guard if you need service from this company.
1,A Big Disappointment,"I purchased this machine a couple of months ago and, like most people, thought it was the best thing since sliced bread! It worked great and I didn't have to sweep my tile anymore with a broom and dust pan. As time passed the vacuum got louder and started making that ominous grinding noise. Yesterday it basically quit. The motor hums but the roller brush doesn't move and nothing is picked up. I have owned the machine only two months and I have thrown away the box. UGH!I was thinking that maybe I did something wrong and seriously considered getting another one. I came to this site to see what others had to say about it. I keep seeing my story over and over again. I'm not sure how Amazon is coming up with a high average review, since most of the reviews have been horrible. Anyway, thank you to all who have written. It will save me another $60.00.Bottom line? Don't purchase this item unless you are independently wealthy and can afford to buy 6 or seven of these things a year."
3,NOT that great a sweeper,"I like it for hardwoods and for the stuff that sits ON TOP of the carpet. But as far as using it as my regular sweeper, forget it. Don't pitch the big sweeper you have to get this one. You will regret it."
3,Cordless sweeper,"Good product, but it is not for overall cleaning. Works well on non-carpeted surfaces like kitchen floors. I've had 2 and they last about a year before they need to be replaced."
2,Can't Handle This One!,"My childhood dust buster held together better than this one. The handle must have been designed by an aggie wanna be. Our place of work has been through two of these models, and each time the handle has broken off, with no way to reattach itself. Now that the handle is broken, my back is also broken since I have to bend down to push the vac, when they could have saved money and just extended the metal rod another 12-18 inches and left it as is without a stupid plastic handle!"
4,Great &quot;little&quot; sweeper,"I really love this sweeper. I have never liked dragging out that big ole heavy vacuum cleaner weekly.This little baby will pick up cat hair, etc. It has a pretty powerful motor. Just treat it as you would any other sweeper.The only thing I DO NOT LIKE about it, is the darn handle. I can NOT keep it on. Everytime I use it, it comes off. Other than the handle, I love this little powerful sweeper."
2,I also had my handle broke off!,"I also had my handle broken off, like other reviews have stated. I had used it for two weeks and loved it! One day as I was sweeping it broke. I have tried for 8 months to get it fixed and trying to get anyone to help is impossible. I finally found out I would probably never get it fixed. So now it's in the trash. I loved using it but I will not waste my money again."
2,Piece of Junk,"This thing does not work at all. All it picks up is the carpet you use it on. We currently use a non electric bissell sweeper on some rugs at our salon and thought maybe an electric sweeper would be more convenient. Everytime we used it, the carpet would get jammed in it and make a very loud noise. For as much money as this thing costs you think it would be better. Do not waste your money on this."
4,It doesn't Suck,"It is a nice sweeper, I like it.It sweeps very good, and it looks very niceand I like it's name, I like sharks."
2,"When it works, It Works Well!","I am now on my 3rd Cordless Shark. The first one melted the battery charger, and the 2nd one broke the gear that spins the edge brush. The 3rd one just broke the same gear!It's a shame, because the vacuum works well, is easy to clean, is lightweight. It just doesn't hold together well.I am going to try the Eureka 570B."
1,Keep your vacuum cleaner,"The shark is merely a sweeper. It does not handle long hair well, it just wraps it around the brush roller. I think it kicks up almost as much dust as it picks up and it is loud. They must mute the sound on TV. The sweeper also does not transition well from area rugs to hard wood floor. It grabs the edges of rugs so you need to lift it up to move to the floor."
2,"Not good enough to toss away your ""real"" vaccuum!","This product is great if you hate lugging out your vaccuum only to do some lite housekeeping, and it's perfect for cleaning a spill here and there like they show on their commercial. But it just isn't powerful enough for real household cleaning. It's not low enough to get under furniture, it can't clean ledges and corners, and hates loose material like pet bedding (gets caught inside.) I'd recommend it only if you can get it at a discounted price. But don't expect it to replace your real vaccuum."
3,At First.......,"At first I loved this! Then ran into some problems. If you have pets in the house, this is horrible if you catch the pet hair because it tangles in the brush. On kitchen or bathroom floor was great. Not good for carpet IF you have pets. It was great for getting the scattered litter though by the litter box.Right now my problem is I need a new battery pack. It quit charging and to my dismay I missed the warranty deadline by a week. It quit charging months ago but I have just put it off due to busy busy busy around here.Does anyone know WHERE to get a new battery pack."
3,Parts for Shark,Does anyone know where to buy parts for the shark stick vacume?I attempted to take it apart when it was not running smoothly and one of the plastic clips broke (from the end edger piece). Does anyone know where to order parts?
1,"Worked for a few weeks, then died. Save your money!","We bought this product and loved it - for a few weeks. Then, it would only hold a charge for an hour, then a half hour, then a few minutes. It seemed to have less and less power as well - it missed things that it would have picked up originally. Finally, it died. For the price, we got a few weeks of good sweeping, but what a waste of money.I contacted the company to complain, and they never responded. Buyer beware!"
2,dont waste your money - quicker to sweep with a broom,"I have linoleum and carpet in my house, and this vacuum cleans neither effectively. For the price, I would expect one of the two to somewhat work, but you basically need to go over the same spot a few times in order for it to pick up. I'm about to give this away to charity and look for another cordless alternative."
1,Worked great,Worked great for about 3 days then starting making bad noise on floor when I started using it. Recharging it does not help. But it does pickup great.
1,do not buy,I bought this product and the first time I used it the belt broke. You cannot buy replacement parts anywhere and I have tried to contact the company since august. No one ever returns phone calls or e-mails. I think we need to contact the better business bureau on this company. Worst product and service I have ever received!!!
4,Pet Owner's Praise,"After years of having to take my vacumn's in for frequent service, either because of clogged pet hair or picking up pennies, I have saved time and money utilizing the Euro-Pro. It is great for picking up the pet hair, cleaning close to the baseboards, and saves the motor from carelessly dropped items."
3,A Little Disappointed,"After using the Shark for several weeks now, I am somewhat let down, in the performance of it. I have trouble running it on my rugs. It works OK on the hardwood floors, but once I move up to the carpets, it won't move easily, and I have to hold it in an odd position. The quality of the machine itself, is less than what I expected. I would not have paid as much for it had I known ahead of time. It has been handy for sweeping the kitchen floor, but I certainly would be surprised if it picks up nuts and screws as it claims."
3,THe Euro-pro company has turnded into sharks.,"Orriganally I was thrilled with the Shark cordless sweeper, but after 3 monthes the handle came apart and could not be fixed.I returned it. Also, my grandmother got one because it was so light and with shoulder problems it would be perfect.Well the gears started to slip and so it was also returned. Does a wonderful job picking up.I cant desiede if it was a good chioce or not."
1,A CHINTZY PIECE OF JUNK - DON'T BOTHER BUYING IT,This feels likes it's going to fall apart in your hands as you're using it. You have to go over crumbs and dirt multiple times before it actually picks it up. The battery life is short -- like 5 - 10 minutes and then it dies.It made of cheap plastic especially the handle. It's wobbly. The handle feels like a piece of junk. AVOID.
1,Cheap flimsy handle! Poor customer service!,"I did love my shark too, it picked up fresh rice and veggies that my kids spilled and edge cleaned like a charm on my hardwood floor. Today, after having it for only a couple of months, the handle broke right off during normal use! The plastic is cheap and just snapped right off in my hand. I have weak wrists and chronic pain, so believe me, I shouldn't have been able to do that if I tried! I called their phone number, which had a message to call another number. I tried that one and the message said it would be a 10-20 minute wait. I called back later, got the same message, but decided to stick it out. The rep that came on the phone said it would cost $8 to replace the handle! I can't believe it only has a 30 day warranty and that the company won't stand behind an obvious defect."
2,light reading for the light headed,"I found this book at the D.I. so I thought for 50 cents I would give it a try. The book is easy reading, though trite, I found the characters to be flawed and I must admit that the book is fiction. 100 per cent unadulterated fiction.The author seems to have taken the anti Mormon rewrite of history and use it to suit his fairy tale of Mormon history.I am not sutrprised that the author is an ex Mormon. Some of the most absurd have been written by alleged writers who did not for some reason or another choose to just let go.I originally gave this book one star but will upgrade to ""2"" stars. One for spelling and one for at least getting the names right.I think the author could be writing great english novellas"
5,A whole new ballgame,"After reading Grimmett's Ferry Woman, I looked for his next book, and was not disappointed. The Wives of Short Creek is a sly and wicked and funny look at modern Mormon fundamentalist polygamy, just coming out before Jon Krakauer's dark Under the Banner of Heaven. They could be mirrors of contrast, and the different points of view quite similar.Wives is as good as the Ferry Woman, but so different as not to recognize Mr. Grimmett's writing. Highly recommended for the sheer entertainment."
1,Poor,"I wish I would have sent it back. I bought it for traveling, but I really doesnt have enough pressure to do much of anything. Im sure it will end up in file 13."
1,broke in a month,first off the pressure was not even close too my old one fore 35 bucks. also it stopped working less than a month into buying it
1,what is wrong with these?,The Interplak WJ2CS Compact Rechargeable Water Jet works well for a short time 3-4 weeks. Then they do not work well. I have had two of them so I have some experience with them. Don't they make things well anymore?Ronald P Peroff MD
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This is a piece of junk. The water jet is not much better than gargling and it broke after only a few months. Although loud, Waterpik products are better."
1,Not great...,"My 10 year old son got this for his birthday. The screws are so deep inside the ball, we finally got so frustrated we just ripped off the foam covering the battery holder to be able to see where to place the screwdriver to get the screws out. (The ball won't bounce anyway!) Even then, the screws would not come out! The lightup goal is great, but the ball is ridiculous. Use your old nerf balls and then it's okay."
3,Should the word Nerf be used on this product?,Purchased it as a fun blow off steam toy in the office. Did not realize that Nerf made hard balls. This ball weighs a too much. Not only can it hurt someone but it actually broke the hoop off its backboard. The 4 plastic pegs that attach the hoop to the backboard broke off in the first week. Very disappointing.The glowing hoop fun for all ages but the ball is all wrong.
4,Nephews Loved it,The nephews loved it. We sent it to them along with other gifts for Christmas. Turns out the twin 8 year olds found this to be their favorite gift. The light up part was pretty cool but they did have some trouble bouncing the ball. When the lights went out the fun really happened. Everything went well even when it turned into tackle-basketball. Not their mom's favorite sport but no harm... no foul.
3,A good idea but not the best design.,"This is a good idea.The ball can light up but,is too heavy.I would not put the battery in even though it makes it light up. it will make the ball to heavy. I think you should still get this."
1,This is no more than a trash disposal warehouse- Cajun Skillet,"I discourage anyone from shopping through this site. I had ordered last week a Christmas present for my wife who wanted an enamel coated cast iron fry pan. I purchased the item through Amazon, and when received today, a bunch of enamel was all broken off of it. I bagged the enamel up and am sending it back never used. I was very disappointed as well as my wife who was looking forward to it. Trash -If anyone related to Amazon or Shoppers Choice review this comment, I feel as an act of apology and common customer decency, you should upgrade my product or send me a ""QUALITY"" item as an apology and an act of respect if you want me to consider future shopping with your organization."
4,Cajun cookware,I just got it. It was easy to clean up. It was made in China so I hope the enamel does not have lead in it like the toy scandal a couple of years ago. The color is very oriental. It is heavy but I like it.
5,Good set of sturdy servers,"They match my ""fancy"" Mikasa flatware set and I've generally used them together for special occasions. Run through the dishwasher with no issues."
2,Bose is of no assistance,"I had this product professionally installed by a home theater expert. after 30 minutes the subwoofer stopped functioning. It was determine the subwoofer was defective. On this system all the speakers route through the subwoofer through a specific Bose wiring harness so the subwoofer is the heart of the speaker system. I contacted Bose and they basically said ""tough luck, contact the seller"". I had to order another complete system to swap out the gigantic subwoofer. As you can imagine, this was a huge inconvenience. The seller Tiger Direct has been ok as they said they would accept the first unit as a return. However, for $1,300 you would think you would get better quality and customer service from Bose. Buyer beware!"
1,This is crap,I can't believe I wasted my money on this one. This is like Prodigy meets NIN with a little Eno in for retardedness. You can't even smoke weed to it.
3,A product of its time-- dream history published in 1923.,"The intention of this little book was to provide an overview of the ancient and modern ideas about what dreaming is and what dreams might mean for the dreamer. It begins with a kind of definition of dreaming and then walks through the different ways that dreams have been viewed-- dreams as reality, omens, thought, wish fulfilment, literature and tool for analysis.Obviously this is not a recently written treatment of the subject and is most useful now as a look at how dreams were understood during the 1920s. It was intended for a general audience, rather than a specialised one. Ratcliff is a decent writer, and the prose is not even too terribly flowery considering when the book was written."
5,Extremely HAPPY!!!!!,I was extremely happy with the service and will definitely order again. The book I ordered came in even better condition than what I anticipated and it was properly packages and received in just a few days. Extremely happy customer!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Too much,"I do like this toy for children, but i think that its way to expensive to buy the house and ALL of the accessories (which you know every little girl needs).Overall i think that it's WAY too expensive."
3,Charming Sleeper,"This film's been unfairly maligned for years; dumped by its distributor and savaged by critics in its initial release, perhaps it can find an appreciative audience in this spiffy new DVD version. The plot, a slight romance between American indie filmmaker Carradine and Italian producer's wife Vitti at the Cannes film festival, is slight, but very pleasant. There's real chemistry between the pair; Monica, particularly, is touching and very appealing. Some genuine laughs in the Walter Bernstein screenplay, sympathetic direction from Michael Richie, and a glorious score from the always-reliable Georges Delarue add to the film's pleasures. Also enjoyable are the unbilled star cameos, and the running joke about the remake of STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE with Vanessa Redgrave and Charles Bronson (if memory serves, such a project was discussed in the 70's; the proposed Stanley was Stallone, even more ludicrous!) The transfer's gorgeous; at bargain price, this one's really worth checking out."
2,"Greatest ""Horrible Zombie Movie"" ever","This movie is so ridiculously bad it actually hurt to watch it. It hurt my sides, because I was laughing so hard. I admit that I bought this movie for two reasons; The gratuitous nudity and I collect horrible zombie movies. I recommend buying this movie (it's cheap) and getting together with about 10 of your closest friends. Then go out and purchase a keg of bud light. When the keg is roughly half gone put this movie in and let the good times roll. That's what I did and it was awesome."
5,An overlooked classic.,"Washington's mastery of the sax shines through all of his work and this is no exception. The two cuts that stand out are Maracas Beach and the fluid and funky Loran's Dance. It's so good, I have two copies on wax."
5,The greatest jazz album ever,Ok whats the problem with the guys at Universal Music Group or umg the last time this album was released to disc was 13 years ago dont you guys think its time for a major upgrade. Now all the other motown releases get deluxe editions of albums but why not this when this album came out i was 1 yrs old hugging on my grandpas hi fi system. Now i'm lucky cause i have on cassette tape but the hissing annoys me but its the orignal so i know i have no choice right. But quick someone reissue this to disc ebay has a copy for auction well peace out universal and amazon good looking also amazon you guys are so so so amazing thanks keep you the good work.
5,This timeless Colonial American classic glows with imagery...,"While too many of our richly written classic are crowded toward the backshelves, there are those which effortlessly remain superior in every literary sense to the many that follow. This is one of these. The author James Fenimore Cooper was of a rare breed who (like Washington Irving & others) were so gifted with a fluent eloquence of such vivid visual expression... As though drawing life itself from their surroundings, they penned their colorful breathing imagery to page with such descriptive intensity, that from the very opening pages we feel ourselves drawn into the lives of our Native American & Colonial forbears of the Hudson Valley & Adirondacks--- becoming one of them again in the present as the written pages fill us with as seemingly familiar recall..."
2,18 month old likes it....,"I wanted to plug my ears and crawl under a rock to hide from these guys. My 18 month old likes it though, and likes to dance to it. I guess that's what really counts!!"
1,NO STARS!!!!!!!,"This was the WORST excuse for a Wiggles video I have seen. We own all of the Wiggles videos and for the most part have been very satisfied. HOWEVER, the Wiggles put this out as a NEW video, even labeled it 2000. It is obviously their oldest video. The music is boring and could lull you to sleep. It is impossible to believe they are actually calling this a Dance Party. Do not waste your money or your time viewing this."
3,"Not a bad video, but I feel sooo misled!","I was dissapointed with this DVD. And it has nothing to do with the quality, albeit poor. It is entertaining to see an early video with Anthony in a short-sleeved golf shirt(green!), as well as playing Captain Feathersword. And what is up with his hair? And Dorothy, well.... My son and I are huge Wiggle fans!! And we both like the video!The dissapointment is from the fact that I didn't know what I was buying. Like others have said, the pictures on the DVD cover show them as they are today, and the copyright date on the back is 2002. I was under the impression I was buying a recent video. Had it said the real date, I would have no reason to be upset. I wish that I had read the reviews before buying, so consider yourself warned!"
3,Not so hot!,"I do agree that the Wiggles may give 100% in this DVD, but the fact that it is so old with terrible props and backgrounds makes it 3 stars or less to me. My daughter received this as a first birthday gift and she won't even look at the t.v. when it's on! She loves all the ""newer"" Wiggles productions. I just feel that for the money my daughter and I want to see the newer Disney Wiggles vs. the Starter Wiggles. I feel this should be offered at a very discounted price."
2,What's up with that?,"This video is just creepy! My son received it from Grandma for Christmas and it's the only Wiggles video that I just can't watch... Their clothes and props are cheaply made. They all need to shave. And Anthony's hair! He looks like a wooly mammoth. Even my son, who is three said ""Those wiggles dirty, need bath, Mommy""... It's really deceptive packaging that upsets me with this video. The pictures on the outside are NOT representative of the tape inside the box."
2,Only buy this if you need the final push for killing youself,"Of course your kid will love it and yell ""AGAIN"" as soon as it's over. Never again, ever!Only buy if it comes with industrial strength earplugs."
4,Kids Love It!,"My kids love this movie! It is one of their older ones and the songs and set are not as creative, but the songs get my three year old and my 20 month old up off the couch and dancing!Definitely recommend it for all kids who love to dance!"
2,WARNING-NO PAUL PADDICK,My son loves Captain Feathersword and I bought this video when he was home sick with the flu. He was sooooo upset that Captain Feathersword was played by someone else (Anthony or one of his brothers). I didn't think the video was that bad--I liked the songs at least. But I wouldn't have bought it if I knew Captain Feathersword didn't appear. And I did check the date on the packaging to see how old it was. The packaging says 2000 but it was made in 1995. I do feel cheated and my son was very disappointed. He hasn't once asked to see it again.
3,It's hard to beat Party Time ...,"After watching a friend's tape (""Wake Up, Jeff""?) and my own (""Party Time"") I think that it's impossible to find as good a Wiggles tape as ""Party Time"". This tape doesn't have enough dancing (not as much as ""Party Time"") and the songs aren't nearly as good. Although I will say it is better than my friend's, which I couldn't sit through. I guess The Wiggles need to make some more tapes or DVDs of their more recent material."
1,Very misleading,"I admit my son and I are huge wiggles fan but I was very dissappointed in this video i bought just the other day. On the cover it says 2001 and has the wiggles on the cover and on the back as they look today and it doesnt say anything about it being an older video. My son loves captain feathersword and he is played by 3 different people in this video!!! Anthony and his brothers, Paul paddick isn't even in it yet. My 4 year old nephew saw it and said what the heck is wrong with Dorothy! The only thing is it was pretty funny to see how far they have come but it was not worth my [money]."
5,Nice watch,The perfect width and size for a person with big hands and arms.I love this watch a whole lot.Yeah m
5,nice,The watch was just as described. My only question is how do you remove links from the watch. It is nicer in person than it is online.
1,Don't even bother,I bought this for my daughter and it broke within the first week of having it. It is not durable at all the plastic is so cheap your are better off with a throw away camera.
1,DANGEROUS JUNK,"This was a gift for my 5 year old daughters birthday. It never worked but I told her she could use it for pretend. She was happy with that. Today after playing with her friend I smelled a burning plastic smell, I searched the house and found the camera laying in my daughters toy box flashing and smoking. It is in the trash now. Do not waste your money and risk your house burning down."
3,Best of Big Bands,"Old recordings with poor sound quality, despite a new method of restoring sound recording by CEDAR. Eddy Duchin was famous as a pianist with unique, personal style. There is not much of him on this recording, which is a disappointment.Good source of his piano artistry are old piano rolls (late twenties and early thirties), which could be released in the form of digitally re-mastered recordings (as it happened with the original Gershwin's recordings)."
4,"It's been awhile since Seth spoke, but still great information",It is interesting information. A very good read. Seth has a lot of great things to say. It makes you hope that this information is really coming from the other side.
2,Very disappointing,"First off, I'm not a naysayer who reviews bands from a genre I dislike just to bash the genre. I'm a huge fan of Oi! While the songs on this ablum, like ""Skinheads in Stapress"" and ""Violence in our Minds"" are definitely classics, often covered, the recordings are so poor and tone-deaf that it's almost impossible to listen to. Roi is definitely not at the top of his game, and the guitar is actually out of tune for half of the songs. Sometimes I wonder if reviewers actually own the album or simply review well from the strength or LR's reputation. If you want to hear the best recordings of LR, get the Death or Glory split. You get their best performance along with some great material from a great Oi band, Combat 84."
2,Soil Mechanics and Foundation Design: 201 Solved Problems,The book seems not refined to me. The figures could be improved and the errors could be minimized. I would not recommend this book.
2,help guide,"There is some information in this book that you might find helpful if you have other books to fill in the gaps. I found that this book was written with the assumption that the DAT in identical to the MCAT. (IT ISN""T!!!!!) She tells you to study stuff that won't be on the DAT....(e.g physics, discribes the process of testing as though it was also the same as MCAT.)I wouldn't recommend this book if it is the only book you are going to buy. But if you just want to get an idea of what might be needed, then it will lead you in the general direction."
2,Generic information; better off research on your own online,This book gives very general information with no details. The author is an old timer who is obviously under-informed about the new computer-based DAT and online application. I would rather go to Student Doctor Network and get more current and specific information about the dental school application process. I would say this book is more inspirational in nature than informational.
5,Amazingly beautiful,"this DVD is truly amazing. Instead of a soprano and alto combination, Timothy Brown aquired the talents of Lawrence Zazzo, a wonderful countertenor to sing the alto part. The result is spectacular. Zazzo's voice mixed with the bell-like soprano creates a beautiful mix.I own this and watch it often. People who know nothing of classical music come to my house and stop and watch, their mouths hanging open in amazement. They simply can't believe how beautiful it sounds.The filming and direction are adequate, but this film is really about the music, and Zazzo's voice.Filmed in All Saints church in Aldwincle, England, this DVD is nothing short of inspirational.If you enjoy Pergolesi's Stabat Mater you will treasure this performance."
1,No diamonds at all,"I have bought this watch as a mothers day gift, especially for the diamonds that were described. It is a chic watch but there is no diamonds at all! (You can estimate how big my dissapointment is) I don't think it's real price worths more than 30 USD.If you want to have a watch with diamonds DON'T BUY THIS WATCH."
1,The rating should be Zero,"This is all old recycled shlock, very poor quality and colorized to boot. Most of it is so late in the Stooges career, it is almost sad to watch. Save your money and spend it on a beeter package."
2,"Good design, bad temperture","The thermometer is made great, the design and clip work well. However, the temperature is off by 10 degrees at boiling and cannot be adjusted. Now that I know that it is 10 degrees off, I can still use it, but as it is a candy thermometer, if you get it too hot you change the candy texture because a few degrees goes from soft candy to hard candy...not so good. Wouldn't recommend this thermometer."
5,Awesome Cartoons,"Check out this collection of hilarious and biting cartoons, I loved it from start to finish! Very clever and inventive, and had me laughing out loud on the subway. Ted Rall is New York's best kept secret, but I bet he won't be for long. A delight!"
5,Great!!,Great price and I'm using it for what I wanted it for. This was the only place I could find this so that is a huge plus.
3,Good for starters,"Thankfully a friend who knits on the looms had given me a heads up about these hooks. You will want to wrap the handle in something to make it larger and more comfy. I used the foam grippy things sold for pencils (and will probably try to fashion a wider handle at some point). You may also need to sand the purple end a bit, one of mine was very rough when I first got it.The hook part is just fine for loom knitting ... just need to make the handle more user-friendly."
3,Good for a cheap loom hook,It's a decent little hook. I've bought several of them just in case I lose one. I've been searching for a loom hook with a much more comfortable grip. Although I can say this hook is way better than the one that come out of the boye loom sets
2,cheap setting,"Even though the stone itself looks really nice, pretty much identical with real diamond, the cheap setting makes the whole ring look cheap.The prongs are obviously asymmetric and disproportional. The band is really thin.I think even putting a real diamond on this ring would look like fake."
2,Cheap,"It looks like it came out of a grocery store gumball machine. I know that it was only $16, but I guess I was expecting a bit more. The prongs were off kilter and the band looks really flimsy."
2,Great Concept But Very Cheap Quality,I had to stop before I completely finished working it. The puzzle looks really cool but the quality of the pieces is bad. I had many pieces that I had to re-cut holes that were not made correctly and several pieces broke trying to take them off of the sheet to start. Some pieces would not fit or stay in place since it was cheaply made. If you buy this I would recommend having an Exacto knife and glue handy. You'll need both. I almost bought another one that is made by the company but I will skip it.
2,What happened?,"Benson's previous two albums are among my very favorites, but this one--which by the way should not have needed two years to make--is just awful. None of these songs has the appeal of anything on Lapalco, and there are more than a few that outright stink. What happened to Benson's genius for melody and hook? And have I overlooked his overuse of simplistic rhyming couplets before? I mean here everything is truly the moon-june-spoon variety. Once you start paying attention to it it becomes painful to listen to.I suppose it's been the collaborative influences of Jason Falkner on the last two albums that made them so great. It's such a shame, because I'd been looking forward to this for ages."
2,Way Overrated,"This stuff isn't that good. There are a couple Cars-eque rockers that are cool but other than that I don't see what the big fuss is about? At the end of the day Benson's work is all mediocre. This is another case of ""famous friends"" association and hype. Save your money and pick up some classic power pop."
4,The alternative to cookie cutter music,"Brendan Benson is a breath of fresh air. From the opening offering of power pop delight (Spit It Out), to a whimsical tribute to his love for The Monkee's on the title track, this album is the perfect soundtrack to livin up a dull man's life. It contains everything one could desire about the simplicity of the 60's. From The Beatles to Elvis Costello, he wears his influences on his shoulder, but never makes the music seems trite or old. This is fresh power pop in the tradition of modern acts like Fountains Of Wayne and Superdrag. Here we are reminded that a gripping tune laid down by truthful lyrics and an intoxicating chorus are all that is needed to declare the message. That message: Brendan Benson loves good rock music, and he wants you to know it."
5,Up to date and useful.,Written in an easy to read manner. Does not bog down with technical language.Information is up to date and in line with current issues.Purchased as a text for a course and used extensively for research.
4,Easiest Labels,"Although a previous reviewer hit the waste that is created by this machine, it still creates fantastic labels. The waste is probably mandated by the size of cartridge that is required to fit into the machine. If you can get beyond wasting 100 feet X 9/16"" worth of material to have a perfect 1/2"" label, then you will love this machine. I have been using this machine (QL-650TD) for about a year now and have nothing but good things to say about it.UPDATE: I actually use the ""waste"" to seal the envelopes I put the labels on. I like this option much better than licking envelopes."
2,must have been a bad batch,"I've had my Brother QL-570 label printer for a couple of years, and love it for ease of use. Granted, there is a shameful (on the part of the manufacturer) waste of paper, but it is cost-efficient for me. As another reviewer mentioned, the excess can be used to seal envelopes.....However,.....the last cartridge (1/2"" continuous) I received (from Amazon) barely sticks to itself, let alone other surfaces. I still print the labels (for neatness sake), but have to anchor them down with tape. I hope this cartridge came from a bad batch, rather than a change in manufacturing. I'm glad I only ordered one, this time."
2,WHAT A WASTE!,"This tape works well and has the required size, only half of the paper is used! The other half is totally wasted since it looks the manufacturer used the same size roll support and paper as in the 1 1/7 inch roll and just scored the strip in half! I have not found a way to use the wasted half, I tried to fool the machine and she (must be a she) is smarter than me. No way trying to roll it back on the support since you have to cut your labels so you end with a lot of tiny blank labels you cannot use in the printer!"
4,A must-have book for anyone interested in SQL server and VB,"This book was recommended to me by by a Microsoft Trainer. I bought the book, but didn't really use it for almost 6 months. I felt it was a little 'talky' and did not address specific issues I was interested in at the time. However, as I've progressed with SQL server, I've realized how good this book really is. It gives an excellent understanding of the underpinnings of SQL server and the different VB interfaces. It helped me through some difficult problems by giving me a better understanding of what was going on at the server level. You cannot rerally use this book as a reference tool. There is not much sample code. You need to read it cover to cover to get all of its benefits. I highly recommend this book.!"
3,Its ok,I just got started in this craft and got this book hoping that it would help...it gave some good info but not really for ground zero beginners. Lots of great ideas but ... not what I had expected.
4,The Old Meadow-Looked at Differentely,"This book is a really cool book, produced by a very good author. It is about a dog, (Grubber) who's owner is going to be pushed out of his home by the council. He gets taken to jail, then rescued by a supposed rattlesnake. There are all sorts of twists and turns. Will the council push the old man out? Find out when you read this awesome book."
2,A mixture of facts and fiction,"One has to distinguish the fabricated ""war of currents"" remains from facts. This book failed to do so by reproducing a mixture of facts and fiction. Moreover, Chapter 9 is composed of heavily lifted content from various science fiction books and comics (often intended to discredit Tesla's name and work). Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book for any audience.Get the book recommended by American Academy of the Advancement of Science ""Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla : Biography of a Genius"" by Marc Seifer.I would also recommend ""Prodigal Genius: The Life of Nikola Tesla"" by Pulitzer Prize-winning author John J. O'Neill.Let's not forget ""Tesla: Master of Lighting"" by Margaret Cheney, Robert Uth and Jim Glenn, a definite book on Tesla."
4,Paper roll refills,This was part of a Christmas gift for my sister and she loved it. I played with it a bit before giving it to her and found it to be user friendly.
2,Not worth the money,I purchased SmartShopper to make my life more organized. I find it takes more time to enter in it. It does not recognize a lot of words and takes to long to enter new entries. It is easier my old way of making a list. I am returning this product.
2,Nerf-n-Strike 3 in 1,"This is a three in one nerf gun with air-driven darts and one air driven missile. The first unit we got had a malfunction in one of the units, corrected in the replacement.Pluses- lots of fun, essentially harmless in the hands of responsible kids, good safety mechanism to prevent shooting oneself with the missile while charging the launcher.Minuses- Impossible to find replacement darts locally. Maybe a little too much technically for a toy- includes a pressure gauge, pass throughs for air so three units can be charged and operated as one. Joining mechanism is engineering plastic and will break sooner than later. Don't get this if you live in an apartment, or have delicate knick-knacks"
3,Good fun until the darts wear out,"This is a great toy, but alas American toymakers all fall into the same trap. They make a toy the kids love and then don't follow up with sufficient supplies to allow for whole families to play. The supply of three to six darts is fine if one kid is playing indoors, but if there is more than one child and they play outside, the need for more darts is critical.The gun from Christmas is still good, but the darts are gone. The gun I bought today will be great fun too, until the darts all break or go ove the fence.I know Nerf made darts for a while. Pick it back up!!!"
2,"Cool looking, but disappointing!","This gun does look like a lot of fun. The pistol works well, but the multiple dart gun works properly about half the time. It includes a very large dart gun, but the instructions clearly state that this CAN NOT be used with the enclosed DVD. (No wonder, since it is more like a rocket launcher.) The enclsed DVD is poor, almost insulting.Save your money and look elsewhere!"
3,Too Short,"I enjoyed all 3 stories, but honestly had I known up front that this was 3 mini stories I would not have purchased this book. This was a selection from our book club and this would've been one of the ones that I passed on. I enjoy reading background and more in dept plots about the characters. As soon as you get lost in the characters then the story is over. I was sort of disappointed. I wish all 3 authors would elaborate with separate books and expand on those characters more."
4,Pretty Good Read,This TCP book was a good read. The plots in this book was crazy. I liked the characters but I also think that the stories were a little bit recycled. But overall this book was hot. TCP is doing the dayum thing because I really like most of their books. The editing seems to be getting better too. I recommend this book to anybody who is looking for a couple short stories to entertain them.
4,bloody good.(since it deals with blood disorders.),"I guess I took a liking for this book ever since I read its earlier edition. This one too is highly reccomended to all clinicians and postgraduate students of Pathology. It is concise, compact and has a wealth of information. Moreover the narrative text is lucid and the tables and flowcharts are real handy. An excellent book for all those dealing in Hemat. and are on the move."
1,LAME!,I bought this book to learn about switching power supplies. The types are not dicussed. The formulas given to calculate inductor values generate results that contradict each other and don't make sense. Reads like a poorly written application note.
1,"Legally damaging, wrong information","Somebody needs to hold this author accountable for disseminating wrong information. This book should be pulled from the market and buyers compensated.If you were to take legal action against the author, I think you would have little trouble winning , for all the errors he's got in there.Some nerve, he knows nothing.I encourage all to return their copy, like I did."
5,"Great service, great product.",I fully recommend this vendor - the puzzle arrived much more quickly than expected & in perfect condition. Creative design & excellent artwork make assembly a lot of fun.
4,Techno,"This is not an album for the average Wishbone Ash fan. If your not into Techno this is not for you. Our parents did not like our music and this is not for our generation. If you are into this type of music however or care to try to open your mind to it, this is an excellent album. Andy possibly should have packaged this under a different name but I'm sure even if he wanted to his promoters wouldn't let him. I would not rate it so high but the more I open my mind to it the more I like it. I have friends who are of this generation that I've turned on to it for feedback and they rave about it. This also shows that Andy is not afraid to try anything because he keeps an open mind. Fly'n Geo"
4,old flicks for the nautical fans,"This is a fun collection of old movies with a nautical interest. The ships are cool and you see a bit of them sailing, but the best part is just watching a clean, old movie with a simple plot.A little drama, a little action and adventure, a bit of comedy and even a song and dance now and then. Well worth having in your DVD collection!"
1,Disappointing,"Much better pirate films are: ""Captain Blood"" and ""Sea Hawk"" with Errol Flynn, and ""Blackbeard"" and ""Treasure Island"" with Robert Newton. Lesser films still better are: ""Crimson Pirate"" with Burt Lancaster for the acrobatic fight scenes, and ""Black Swan"" with Tyrone Power. Even the pirate comedies, ""The Princess and the Pirate"" with Bob Hope, and ""Muppet Treasure Island"" are better than these.All the movies on this DVD were shot on sets with unimaginative scripts, and are unbelievable. ""Against All Flags"", touted in shill-reviews, has a very old Errol Flynn who shows the effects of alcoholism, which has completely eliminated his prior charm. The script is not interesting. ""Buccaneer's Girl"" with Yvonne De Carlo was the best of the lot, but still not worth the effort. Yvonne De Carlo is better in ""Song of Scheherazade"". Maureen O'Hara is better in ""Jamaica Inn"" and ""At Sword's Point""."
5,Good choice,"I ordered these to replace the failing batteries in my cordless drill. The new batteries arrived quickly, fit perfectly, were reasonably priced, and had a full charge when they arrived! Good product, good seller. Highly recommend!"
3,Not very Good Movies but not to be Missed to See,I think from the 4 Movies The Lawless Breed more interested to see Young Rock Hudson in western movies .
2,I didn't find what I expected to....,"I really loved the 3 movies, but what I liked the best was when Michael's son sings the Godfather Love Theme for him..... but IT'S NOT IN THE CD.... I just bought the CD for that song... even the instrumental version of that song is not on the CD... I think I'll buy the 1st or 2nd CD...."
4,Durutti Column keeps moving on,"What a fantastic new record. ""Nina"", a strong opener, brings all of DC's trademarks - Vini's vocals and overlapping guitar, great percussion with a tight production. ""It's Wonderful"" keeps the momentum with its neverending looping guitars. ""Let Me Tell You Something"" is classic, powerfully mixing genres. The closing track, ""Waiting"", is probably DC's most beautiful and emotionally charged song. Fans will love it. New listeners will definitely want to revisit DC's whole back catalogue."
1,This is what happens when you rush it,"I love Ben Folds, and the two other Bens involved are pretty good too. That leaves me wondering how exactly three massively talented people can come together and poop out something that is massively worse than anything any of the three have produced alone, and the only answer I can come up with is that they just rushed it. Just sat there and made stuff up without giving it any time to gestate, without taking the time to step back and ask whether it's actually any good. The songwriting is repetitive and formulaic, the instrumental performances are unimpressive, and the singing is just passable. I'd love to see these guys get together for a project that they actually put some effort into it, because this was not it."
5,Good quality,"Sturdy, color is good, stands up well to folding etc.Arrived on time. Held up great to cutting and folding."
2,not what I expected,This a good book in general if you want to rate your knowledge. If your taking the NCC Inpatient OB Nursing Certification Exam this will not help you. The test is more factual. This book is more on nursing care and actions that you would take in patient care situations.
5,a superb achievement,"The members of Toad the Wet Sprocket are true musicians, and it really comes through on this album (my favorite of all Toad's). ""I Will Not Take These Things for Granted"" is probably my all-time favorite song by them, but ""Hold Her Down,"" ""All I Want,"" and ""Pray Your Gods"" are wonderful as well. I think Glen Phillips's voice is amazing, and there are some great performances on this CD."
5,HILARIOUS!,"I heard about this movie thru some friends, so I decided to check it out. I'm not that familiar with samoan culture, but all I can say it was pretty funny. Check it out is worth it."
4,Had this recommended by a colleague,Saw this movie on television first and loved it. In Australia it is known as Sione's Wedding. I enjoy creative smaller independent productions that capture the emotions and lifestyles that are different from my own. There are many laughs to be had in this movie.
1,Too Good to be True,"Buyer Beware.Item delivered was correct model but did not have ball bearing slide drawers. I'm no expert but the paint is probably not powder coat. I also ordered a rolling chest but denied delivery after seeing this top box.Do yourself a favor, skip the hasle and go to Sears."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This book is 8"" x 7"" and 72 pages. If I had seen it in the bookstore and browsed through it I would NEVER have bought it. It contains many photos - so it's not even 72 pages of text - and gives advice like ""eat healthy foods"" and ""get adequate sleep."""
3,heated lotion dispenser,It was not what I expected but does not mean others will not like it just my opinion
3,it's only ok,"It warms the lotion, but the container has to be about half full to pump. The lotion is warm, but cools rapidly on the skin."
4,Now this is grindcore...,"This is easily my favorite Napalm Death cd. I have always thought they were good...but not caring for how straight-forward death metal they became. they bring the grindcore back on this cd, and do it perfectly. barney's vocals are brutal and inspired, and the band is hectic and crushing. The production is dirty yet not too polished like some of their death metal releases. If you wished they grinded more, then buy this."
5,One of the better introduction to CS books,"This isn't a book about programming, it isn't a book about laying out a spreadsheet, reading this book isn't going to give you skills on the latest Microsoft operating system.It's a book on COMPUTER SCIENCE. Computer Science is more related to math than the ""computers"" most people think of. It isn't practical, it's theoretical -- it's supposed to be.It cracks me up to read the reviews where the reader just doesn't get the whole premise of the book.I first read this book in the Fourth Edition when I had a CS-101 class. About 8 years have passed, and I'm considering going for a MSCS, so I wanted a refresher. This book was invaluable in the 4th Ed, the 7th Ed is even better. The material is easier to follow, better diagrams, and expanded material.Get it if you want a good overview of Computer Science -- if you're looking for Microsoft training, look elsewhere."
4,Love Does Stink,This movie is Halarious.. It is about a sitcom writer who's best friend gets married and decides to find him the right woman..Seths fiend hooks him up with Chelsy who is an evil want to be bride..She tricks Seth into letting her move in and then the horror begins..They Play dirty tricks on each other and Seth gets his final revenge on her FINALLY at the end of the movie
1,This Movie Stinks,"This movie is so annoying that it's still annoying me and I'm not watching it. Thinking about it annoys me.Despite the title, this movie is not about love. It's about people being rude to each other. No one in this movie is in love with anyone else with the exception of French Stewart's love of himself. He appears to think he's pretty funny, but instead he is just grating. Maybe he's funny for 22 minutes on that Third Rock sitcom (I've never seen it) but 90 minutes of this guy is almost intolerable. Why is he always grimacing? Does he know he looks like that?The movie is also completely degrading to women. It portrays them as materialistic, scheming bimbos. This movie was obviously written by a guy who has been ""burned"", but if he thinks as highly of women as he does of the female characters in this script, it's no wonder.And finally, the end is cheap and anti-climatic and the last big laugh(?) was in the trailer.Boy, did I hate this one."
3,review,"delivery was very fast, but we needed to return it, my wife didn't like the color. The difficulties we had in returning it were very frustrating. We finally succeded today in getting what we needed to send it back.., I would not buy anything form Shoplet again for this reason."
4,Studyed this book and passed NCLEX the first time!,Hello I used this book to study for the NCLEX-RN in May 2007 and passed the test the first time. I would highly recommend this as a study tool for the NCLEX-RN and would recommend reading all the chapters and working the questions in the book and the CD
3,Get what your really looking for,"This is a great book, matter of fact excellent book!........... if you are preparing for the Nclex.However, if you are looking for something to help you with your tests during nursing school as well as preparing you for that Nclex coming down the line, this is not necessarily the book for you. There is only 1 practice test in this book, and 1 practice test on the CD-rom.You do gain access to more online tests with the purchase of the book and that is really great. However, if you are looking for something you can turn to while you are in Nursing school that is readily available in a book form to help take the edge off the dreaded weekly tests this book is not the one. I'd recommend the Saunders!Good Luck!"
2,NOT the best,"In my opinion this book was NOT the best for the boards. I and several friends agree that SAUNDERS is more uptodate with the material on NCLEX. With that said, I passed using Saunders and the CD. i did use Kaplan and honestly did not find it as good as Saunders. The best part, the CD has a few thousand questions including the ""new format"" style questions. Good luck on boards everyone."
3,4th Birthday Gift,This is a cute idea for younger kids. My daughter can work this by herself and is learning to sing to songs. She also is talking to us. This is a lot of fun for her and her DAD!!!
1,"Sing With Me, NOT","Very cute toy, if it worked. The cd player would not play a cd on the first one I bought and the same thing when I exchanged it for a new one. Finally, I got my money back. Very dissapointed."
2,Parent intervention needed,"My 4 year old cannot load the CD's by herslef. It requires parent intervention to get the CD to play. It is tricky. Turn it off, load the CD then turn it on. Once the CD it loaded properly, she can navigate on her own. She loves to sing along."
2,A waste of money,"This is supposed to filter the air on an Essick Air H-series console humidifier. In fact, it actually blocks the air to the unit and makes it much less efficient. It's an optional attachment to the unit and is completely unnecessary unless you live in a really filthy environment -- like maybe in a coal mine. Listen, we have three cats and I never saw any cat hair in the filter. The filter never got dirty. Does this tell you something?"
2,Essick whole house humidifier,After spending all this time setting it up the fan did not work. I took this as a bad sign and just sent it back. I bought two more room size humidifiers and will just fill them up each night. Easier in the long run.
1,"coundn't get it to work - Fort Myers, Fl",I paid the $2.99 for the download but I couldn't get the Unbox player to work. I spent about an hour trying to trouble shoot the problem but no luck. My computer meets the requirements and I tried to follow some advice under the help section of their website. I am going to just buy the DVD.As for rating the quality of the game...it is an easy 5.0 out of 5.0 in my book. It was the best sporting event I had ever witnessed. What a game! I can't imagine a better 4th quarter/overtime.
5,Solid Lock,This is a perfect lock for my needs in a wet environment situation. I will do the job required of it
5,Great product at a great price,Ordered three of these locks for our church cafe. They are easy to use and very inexpensive.
5,WORKS AS ADVERTISED,"I bought the Vivitar MagnaCam 1025x1 as a ""refurb"". I took it along on a roadtrip through the Salmon and Snake River country in Idaho last summer. Found the binoculars to be quite useful and netted around 50 photos that turned out to be real keepers. I was particularly pleased with some of the details the Vivitar Magnacam picked up on tall rock formations. My other digital camera just didn't have the lens. This camera is not for the family picnic or class reunion, but I could see a hunter, hiker, skiier or pilot finding lots of uses for the product."
3,"Good story, Love Cooper, needed more action!","My title said it all, a good story about a indenture slave girl who meets the handsome well-to-do land owner, who buys her freedom on a ship back to the Colonies. Bad guy fools girl into thinking he bought her. Then we get on to adventures of Indian raids/battle (needed more of this), and colonial drama, etc. Costumes are pretty much spot-on for most period movies in those times. Cooper's Va. state-line officer uniform is very nice. Acting is fair to good.... I liked the battle scene were the frontier people our holding out against the raiding Indians...Didn't care much for the part where the good guy fools the Indians with a compass like they were fresh off the turnip truck, err...wagon. Finally, if you loved ""Drums along the Mohawk"" like I did, you will like Unconquered.....A nice addition to any classic movie collection."
1,Disappointed,"Yes, I was very disappointed while reading this book, I expected more excitement as the Title was so attractive as well as the summary of the book, but I forced myself reading almost reached half way refusing to accept the fact that it is a boring reading."
4,The book which makes all other books superfluous,"When Ifinished this book, I said to my husband: this book resembles the book I am presenty writing so much, that I can stop now. It has been done already. It is a truly haunting story about family life and love, and its destruction by death of a child. It ordinary - and yet sophisticated and truly marvelous in the way emotions are depicted, especially the small ones. The people who did not like the book were maybe looking for an easy read, or simply easily bored because deep emotions are not to be superficially accessed. And the one lady who wrote in her review that children do not have sexual feelings is very much mistaken: by wishful thinking or repression maybe?"
2,wanting more,Cute newsboy hat. I have a black one that is similar. Major issue...not enough fullness in the cap. Newsboy hats need to flop a bit. This one doesn't have enough fabric to create that floppy look. So...a little skimpy. Sorry.
2,the essence and applications of taijiquan,"Excellent pictures, waste of time, the sequencing of them not needed if one wants to learn anything. The writing to esoteric. A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY."
1,bad service,I bought 5 Gongfu books and payed about 65 USD by credit card but I only got 2 books. I have written to Amazon customer service but haven't got any response.
4,they could have done better...,"don't get me wrong. I like the CD. But their best is still the first with the extensive guitar and drum instrumentals. they could have done better. how can I say that? Well the last ""track"" is just 1:30. It's acoustic guitar and vocals. And it sounds really amazing. I really regrett it that they haven't made a whole song out of it. Here Ted Leonard's voice is so intensive that it astonishes me every time I listen to it. Maybe next time... By the way: a B I G Recommendation:Fates Warning - Parallels!!This disc is very atmospheric, alomost calm. It really adds profundity to life if you listen to it. Amazing. But it need's several run-throughs.The road goes on forever...(Fates Warning highlight)"
2,Doesn't seem very accurate,"This thing takes forever to get up to temperature and seems pretty inaccurate. It has temp suggestions for different meats on it, but if you actually go by what the thermometer says all of our meat comes out WAY overcooked."
2,Good for diehard fans only.,The whole concert is filmed with one camera up in the rafters. Kind of like you would do if you were taping it for a friend. The sound is mediocre. Its barely one step better than a bootleg. You'd be much happier with the MACHINEHEAD concert DVD which is top notch is sound and video.
2,Nothing like the website,As someone who used to play all the episodes on the website I was excited to finally see this movie. Sadly I was very disappointed. The movie is digital and pretty corny. Dont waste your money.
5,Good Read-Terrible Tragedy Very Sick Individual,"One of the most tragic stories I have read, he really had everyone fooled. I am sure there is a very special place in hell for him. God Bless her parents and the little child that was left with no mother."
2,Dissapointment.....,"I am an avid true crime reader and this book was a real dissapointment for me. Although this book is very well written, it was basically only about the prosecutions case and nothing else. We don't read about Stefanie and Craig's relationship, nor what their childhoods were like. All we get is page after page of the prosecutors building of the case. We don't get any insight of what Stefanie's family and close circle of friends were thinking at the time, nor what they are feeling today. And as for the ""haunting pictures"".....please, this book showed less pictures than almost all the books I have read."
4,Daring and successful,"This short album is my favorite collection of work by the Cranes. Very haunting themes throughout, and a strong control of mood. Starting with a crushing evil-sounding wall of bass, then contrasted with a high-pitched sometimes hopeful, sometimes frightened, faerie voice. The lyrics are pretty much spoken-word throughout, since it is really Sartre's play (or a subset of it) set to music. It is an active listening experience. All of the lyrics are in the original French. Liner notes explain the story."
1,disappointed,The ring looked foggy and not clear. I wore it for two day's and took it off. I'll probably replace the stone with a better one because the setting was sterling silver.
4,Gorgeous marquise ring,"I love my ring, it fits perfectly, I ordered it on a Saturday, it arrived Thursday.I had been wanting to buy a ring for quite a while now, and I love this one.The stone is gorgeous, it shines in low lighting. My only complaint is that the band has received many scratches since I got it.. I blame it on my wearing it almost non-stop, but then again I don't do anything extreme that I would expect to scratch it. The band is very thin, it hasn't lost it's shape, but it took some getting used to a band this thin.Overall, I still love this ring, the scratches aren't enough to make me regret getting it."
1,"This is not an ""official"" Microsoft Zune Charger","I've been browsing around amazon looking for a car charger to fit my 1st generation Zune. After doing some searching, it is very clear that this is NOT a Microsoft Zune Charger despite the description. If you search amazon and you will find the official zune chargers to have a different shape.Just a warning for any Zune owners who may have wandered this way."
1,Did Not Work,I recieved the charger and tried to use it and it would not charge my Zune. I have 2 other chargers of different brands and they work fine.
2,very cheap build,"The product is the second picture shown above. The build quality is the worst I've ever seen in any charger. I'm almost reluctant to use it since it feels so flimsy. It is cheap, but it works, for today anyway. Spend a little more and get something to last more than a week."
2,"Not as good as other ""Dummies"" books.","Bought this book because I was so impressed with ""Perl 5 for Dummies"", but ""TCL/TK for Dummies"" doesn't measure up. Lots of mistakes, no good reference material in the appendix section, and not very well organized. An example irritant is a reference to more information on the ""listbox command"" in chapter 22... while the book ends with chapter 21."
5,good,"I purchase it at price $4, very good for the price! Also the produce is good, you will never regret."
2,Takes several attempts to open at times!!,"I have one of these locks for school. When I am in a hurry for class and need to simply open and close my locker it does not help when the lock decides NOT to open!!! I have been using lockers for years and all open just fine besides this one, so it's not me. I will put in the combination repeatedly, over and over and over at times until FINALLY it clicks open!!! It's almost as if you need to be not only on the right numbers, but this lock wants you to be on just the right spot on those numbers for it to work. This doesn't happen all the time, but it happens enough. I need a new lock. It doesn't help at all being a college student late for class over a locker issue!"
1,These combo locks are easily defeatable...that includes the new Master anti-shim combo locks.,"I just had my locker broken into while using the new Master anti-shim combination padlock. The thief used some sort of prying tool to rip open the housing where the shackle locks. If you decide to use these types of locks to secure your valuables, you are kidding yourself; you might as well use nothing at all. There are better locks out there that offer better security, although, you might have to spend more."
5,I literally can't think of anything negative to say,"I'm not quite sure how to review a lock, but I can tell you that its kept my belongings from being stolen at the gym EVERY time. The owner of the lock is really the one more to be scrutinized than the lock itself - because the lock can only work properly if used correctly by its owner. So really - as long as I remember the combination, turn the dial all the way, and make sure to remember which lock is mine [marking yours may be a good idea] I have a good 'lock experience'."
1,Pain to use.,"I understand that if you're not use to a combination lock, then its going to take you a few tried to get it right. However, this lock takes multiple tries every single time you go to open it."
1,"Waxy, Greasy Texture","The best comparison I have with the texture of this ""cream"" is imagine taking candle wax and rubbing that into your hands. There's your O'keeffe's cream. If you have dry skin go with a more natural organic route."
2,Doesn't seem to work,"Read the reviews and really thought I had a product to work the way it was portrayed. Not so. Used it for about a week, rubbing it on after my bath and then wearing socks to bed. My feet are still very rough."
4,Does the job!,NIce cream that goes on without feeling greasy. I can put it on at night and not cover my feet with socks.
2,Heard about it from a friend,Have seen this at a local store and a friend swears by it.It is VERY long lasting but I just don't see the big deal. One small jar goes a long way and maybe that justifies the expense?
3,Exactly the same,"I bought this, along with the hand creme at the same time. Was quite surprised to find the ONLY difference between the two is the color/size of the jar. Exactly the same otherwise except this is slightly smaller and blue packaging. And a bit higher cost. As for the stuff itself....it's generally heavy and greasy feeling, makes my feet 'stick' to the sheets at night and not especially effective. Perhaps I was anticipating something much more based on previous reviews but did not find anything overly special in this jar. Not a bad creme....hardly worth the price though."
5,Vanilla milk gift set,very nice set and love the aroma of it. packed well & arrived fast (less than a week from purchase date!!) would buy from again.
2,not very satisfied with this knife,"Not very satisfied with this knife, the knife and handle is lock by 2 small nuts inside of the handle. It is easy become slack. Althought the company provide lifetime warranty. But due to the way it make. It is really weak. The knife is good look,but not thing good at all."
2,Where is the struggle?,"First, let me say that I am an evangelical pastor who has the greatest respect for Billy Graham. I believe he has done more to further the gospel message in America than any single evangelist of our time. Second, it seems that my review will be in the minority as it seems to have been given 5 stars by everyone else who has read it.With that said, I eagerly opened this book hoping for insight into his life. How he dealt with struggles. How he dealt with marriage and travel in the midst of his extensive ministry. What I got instead was an itenerary of his travels and very few insights into the difficult decisions that must have been made in his life. There is a great deal of humility within these pages, but very little vulnerability.While I respect this man as much as any Christian that has lived in my lifetime, I found this book hollow."
4,Animal Bloopers & Funny Moments,"This DVD is some what in the style of Americas Funniest Home videos. It's pretty funny, (but no Bob Saget) :-( if you like to see animals doing stupid things, or amazing things! It's kinda like that show on Animal Planet. I recommend this DVD to anyone who can laff at nothing, or everything."
3,ok ring,"The ring was real pretty and sparkly! But the band scratched real easily! I'll continue to wear it, till I get a new ring! What can you expect from a cheap ring! Brilliant Cut Clear Cubic Zirconia Solitaire 3mm Band Sterling Silver Ring Size 5"
2,Did Not Recieve It,The item never came but I am happy with the service they refunded me my money. A little disappointed that it did not come because I was looking forward to wearing it so much.
4,The Land Girls,"I WAS AN 8 yr. OLD ENGLISH BOY DURING THIS PERIOD OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR..THIS MOVIE IS SO CLOSE TO THE TRUTH THAT IT IS UNBELIEVABLE. MANY A YOUNG WOMEN IN MY AREA WERE LAND GIRLS WHO MARRIED SERVICEMEN OF ALL COUNTRIES AND HAD THEIR DREAMS DASHED BY DEATH. THE FARM YARD SETTINGS AND THE SOUNDS OF THE ANIMALS TOOK ME BACK ""HOME""--ESPECIALLY MILKING TIME--I KNOW--I RATE THE MOVIE AS ""BEAUTIFUL"""
5,How to be a no limit person Dr wayne Dyer,"I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Wayne Dyer and this cassette collection. It has changed my outlook on life. Everyone needs to listen to what Dr. Wayne has to say, it can only enhance your outlook on life. The only limits that exist are the ones that we place on ourselves. After listening to Dr. Waynes Tapes and reading his books I realize that there is nothing that I cannot accomplish if I set my mind to it. I do not feel the need any longer to worry about things that will probably never happen or that no amount of worry can prevent. I realize that yesterday is over, tommorow has not happened but today is my masterpiece to be lived to it's fullest."
2,"So, so...",I purchased these cd's after the founder of Spanx said she used these to propel herself to billionaireism. So far I'm finding it a bit boring...but I'll keep trying to get through it
2,better now,I like him much better with time. I don't care for the man's lectures in his 40's as much as I do now that he's in in 60's.
4,"Mr. Crosby has an excellent ""war record"".","This CD from the Cros features a nice mix between some of his better known tunes,(especially if you enjoy his films) and some tunes that are WWII classics but not as associated with Bing. If you love the talent of Bing Crosby, you should at least consider getting this."
3,ehh?,"The book is really good if you don't know spanish and just want to read something to the patient and get a response that you don't understand. Don't get me wrong, it really is a decent book, but the emphasis is certainly not on learning medical spanish and is more on getting your point across to the patient. How you would interpret their answer will remain a mystery to me...I'll let you know how it went when I get back from our medical missions trip to Nicaragua."
3,not too impressive,"i was looking for something to help bridge the gap between my high school spanish courses many years ago and communicating with the massive amounts of spanish speaking patients. this is better than nothing, but some things i wanted to ask weren't in here and some things that i usually dont ask are in here. definitely more optimal for an ambulatory setting as opposed to inpatient medicinei guess i just need to break down and learn some more spanish for real and not rely on little pocket books"
3,Pocket Medical Phrase Translator,This would be excellent for a physician and/ or primary care nurse in an ambulatory setting
2,Quickly Ruined,"I searched in some local household goods stores and couldn't find anything that was the plain chrome/stainless steal look I wanted. When I found these and for such a good price, I jumped on the opportunity. When they arrived they seems very thin and light weight. Sadly the covers only lasted a couple of weeks. When I replaced the cover while the burner was just slightly warm, the electric coil literally burned a mark into the metal. This happened not once, but twice (by another member of my household).I say save your money and look for a better option."
5,Covers,"We looked all over for almond colored burnes, no one has them in the stores. They came in in time for christmas."
2,Nothing special!!!,This product arrived nicely packaged but was completely overrated by previous individuals. To be honest the product description is misleading as well. These covers are the standard flimsy ones that get the job done but not better than any other ones around this price. You are better off getting some from Wal Mart or a regular supermarket environment where you wouldn't have to pay for shipping and end up having to wait for it to arrive.
3,Watch What You Order,"Still have almond appliances including electric stove. Searched for new porcelin stove burner covers. I was so glad to find them available. Should have read closely since the product received was just almond painted metal, not porcelin. The price was more than a similar one listed at almost half the price...these will do and I will use but know they cannot withstand an accidental heatup like the porcelin ones do. thanks for asking."
3,Looks nice but a bit flimsy,"I bought the blue and white and while they are nice looking, they are very thin and bend very easily. I would avoid putting any weight on them."
2,Thin as foil,"Very low qualit product , had to return it . I got Klen Range covers at local target for 15.XX - much better quality"
2,"Set is beautiful, but not safe for dishwasher or microwave","When I received this set, I loved it! They are beautiful dishes, but not safe for the dishwasher or microwave. They chip easily and get very hot in the microwave. A matter of fact, they get so hot that my husband and children have burnt their fingers. The heat goes right to the plate, but will not heat the food. If you want a set of beautiful dishes that you are going to hand wash and never put in the microwave, this would be the set. Otherwise, I would not buy these dishes."
4,Great,"This product is pretty sturdy and very pretty. Only thing is when you cut stuff on it, or scrape the fork, it makes a weird sound, but you kinda get used to that. Also, I had a slight issue with the shipping and was supposed to get a little something back, but still haven't. Great product though!"
3,These Are Okay,"These are okay, pretty tart in taste and are freeze-dried. They have the texture of the ""space ice cream"" I used to get as a kid at the Air & Space Museum."
5,great book!,"I just wanted to correct one review here, the one that just gave one star... This is a book for bird lovers in the scientific sense, eg naturalists or orinthologists. This isn't a book about bird breeding and selling... This book is a fauna book, our a sort of Psittacum specium... The book provides a brief overview of the natural histoty of these wonderfull birds (evolution classification etc), plus incredible illustrations and wonderfull detailed descriptions plus distribution maps. I am a botanist, but I have a passion for parrots. this book will allow to feed that passion. Next time I head to the south american jungles, I will keep my eyes open and hopefully be able to name a few parrots I see from far.So, in my view this book deserves straight five stars!"
2,"not big, not bright","Can't see it from more than 30 ft. blue lights are very dim. Basically junk. Shipped in an envelope, fortunately not damaged"
5,Perhaps Branford at his best,"If you like good jazz ""in the tradition,"" this is a must for any jazz collector. ""Roused About"" has a great monkish feel to it (named after one of Monk's tenor players). ""The Beautyful Ones"" is a sublime ballad, and reminds me of Coltrane's meditative pieces like ""Alabama""-- but very ""operatic"" in some sense. The musical approach is largely free, and emotionally tense, but not necessarily atonal (think 60's Miles Davis, not Ornette Coleman). If you are into Kenny G, don't buy this album-- this is real jazz-- not instrumental pop!"
3,A tale of packaging,"The soup tureen server is exactly what I wanted; the hassles with breakage was not. The china ladle would be wedged into the box; any little jarring of the box could break the ladle. I ordered 24 of these servers, so imagine the amount of returns with 40% breakage. At this time I am still waiting for 4 ladles."
5,History of African-American legislators,"""King of Cats"" was an extremely entertaining and enlightening historical record. I have always wondered why ACP Jr. was left out of public school social, political and civic text books. After reading Wil Haygood book, I think I know why. APC Jr. did'nt subscribe to a compromising ""go with the flow"" black political agenda.The writing of Haygood sounds as if he personally walked with ACP Jr. for some 50+ years. I felt as if I was there in Harlem, in Washington and Abyssian. I laughed, I cried, I felt the victories and the disappointments. Great book. A must read for religious, black history or political scholars who want to know the truth on how to ""level the playing field"" for oppressed people."
5,Well-documented resource,My patients often ask me questions about magnet therapy. This book answered all my questions and then some. I recommend it both to my patients and colleagues who want a clear explanation and well-documented resource.
2,"good idea, bad execution","As other reviewers have mentioned, the photos are grainy. very grainy. However, left unmentioned was something even more troubling - many of the photos have been digitally cropped in photoshop or some such program. this was done presumably to save ink by not printing backgrounds. The cropping was done extremely poorly and amateurishly - there are toes that come to points, feet that look like blocks, all sorts of bizarre and unnatural concavities. a real hatchet job. the end result looks like someone took a pair of scissors and crudely snipped photos from a magazine. this sort of problem is particularly distressing in a book intended for artists as the accurate depiction of the outer contour of a form is vital for drawing.On another note, the models are not actually that thin. more average. This would have been a useful book, if not for the botched photos. An older edition would likely be satisfactory."
1,Disappointing!,"I bought ""The Figure in Motion"" because I often portray people in active outdoor situations, sports, dancing, etc. Thought this would be a good reference. Unfortunately, the poses in this book are so completely unnatural, they are pretty useless. I cannot imagine why anyone would be leaping and cavorting about in such a bizarre fashion unless they were a member of a modern dance troupe, or are in severe need of physical therapy. Many of the photos have deep shadows which partially obscure the figure, making it even less helpful. And to top it off, most of the models are not pleasingly proportioned in the classical sense, which makes their awkward gyrations all the more unattractive. I usually don't write negative reviews, but this book is worth warning people off of. My advice is, go find it in a book store and take a good look at it before you decide you want to buy it."
2,Pictures Quality,The quality of the pictures need significant improvement. As an artist you need all possible details for the best results.
4,Pleased,"The price was right, the product preforms as described. It is not the strongest lock but what do you expect for ten bucks? And that's $5 per lock! I am a happy camper. What more can one say?"
1,Faster to use jimmy than to use combination,It's incredibly easy to jimmy open. It only takes a minute to make the shim and then a couple seconds to use it.[...](Can skip to 2:10)Makes me question Master Lock's reliability...
3,Getting there...,"After knocking around as an ""indie"" band for a number of years, this major label debut with bigger, smoother production showed the Trees to have ""hit"" potential. Especially catchy are the tunes ""Bed Of Roses"" and ""Something About Today."" They really hit their stride, however, with their best, most rocking release the next year with Sweet Oblivion, which featured the hit ""Nearly Lost You"" which appeared on the Singles movie soundtrack. Sweet Oblivion is the one no self-respecting grunge connoisseur should be without. But if you love that, there'll be some here to enjoy, especially if you like their slightly mellower, slower sounds."
1,Bad Pitches,"If you are sensitive to pitches you will not want this recording of Beethoven's 9th. Although the soloists are OK, the high notes in the choir pieces are so off it's hard to listen to. The poor quality of the recording takes some getting use to, but once you get over that the choir comes in. I'm still hunting for something better."
1,Not great,The mat is very sensitive. My son sweat a little and it went off. This alarm DID NOT wake up my 5 year old! It may help a child who is a lighter sleeper but did nothing at all for my son
4,A Good Follow-up,"This movie is just as funny as the first and has several hilarious scenes (the play on words for the Hotel Coral Essex and the discussion of infinate smallness). The musical number that the nerds do this time around even tops the first! Booger meets his master in this one. Everyone's favorite alpha joins the nerds too.The ending goes a little overboard but if you want a few gut wrenching belly laughs, see this film."
3,Idaho history,"A young 14 year old girl and her 18 year old brother are trying to make it as storekeepers in Idaho mining towns of the 1860's. Melvena is worried her older brother, Tom is too caught up in making money to be the kind and generous person their parents raised him to be. Various situations come up with townspeople before Melvena and Tom realize a plan that they are both willing to work together to achieve."
4,One of Motown's most criminally underrated and overlooked artists.,"The fact that such an obviously talented vocalist was not properly promoted and that her four albums for Motown received only scant promotion and publicity is truly shameful and disgusting. This was her second album and features such highlights as ""Blame It On The Sun""{, ""Mr. Troublemaker"", ""Love Comes From The Most Unexpected Places"" and the Gospel-Funk-Disco hybrid JAM ""Come In Heaven, Earth Is Calling"". Motown really NEEDS to reissue all four of Tata's albums on CD as they've been unavailable for too long and are more than worthy of a reappraisal. On the plus side, this Japanese import CD was properly remastered and the P-Vine label should be thanked for reissuing it."
5,Finally!!!,"I was 6 years old when this album was released! My mother would play this album really loud and we would sing it around the house. When I became old enough to work the record player myself, I would sneak and listen to the songs over and over. Now the album is long gone, and it has been years since I have heard these songs, but they have remained in my heart. I have been looking for Totally Tata on CD for years and I am so happy to see that it has finally been released. I will be purchasing one for me and one for my mother. The entire album is beatuful and I think it can still have the power to touch people like it did me so many years ago... especially ""Come in Heaven, Earth is Calling"" and ""Blame it on the Sun."""
3,Pretty shoe but heels too high,"I bought this shoe thinking that I could grow accustomed to the heel height. I had wanted the Selene, which is the same shoe style but with a lower heel. I was wrong. The shoe is pretty, but I could not stand and walk comfortably in this shoe. I wish the lower heel in this color was not sold out. I guess that must tell me something."
5,Best Pumps Ever,"I am addicted to these Nine West Pumps. They're plush and comfortable. A wide classy variety of textures and colors. It's runs a 1/2 bigger in my experience. I usually wear 8.5 for closed toe shoes. But I opted for the 8 with my 2nd set of purchases. The 8 gave a more secure/snug fit as opposed to the 8.5 which fit, but was a bit more loose.I am a fan of this shoe for my work life. Two thumbs up Nine West."
3,Everything ok but the size,"I received the package on time. The shoes are as I though. They are perfect. They are beautiful! However, they sent me one size larger. I cant'use them. Why!!!"
3,Mediocre,I bought these because they look like smart comfortable work shoes. They are but this is my third pair in about a year and each time they fall apart. The heels wear out within 2 to 3 months and I've e Engadget where the top started to fray. I don't know what it is but after 3 pairs I'm not willing to buy anymore. Hope you have better luck!
5,Comfortable and Stylish,"My black, sueded Rocha pumps are sleek and stunning. The slight platform is covered in a pebbled, almost faux snake skin like the four-inch heel. The dark color mutes the texture down to an accent rather than a centerpiece. The shoe is soft and smooth on the outside and inside.I ordered these pumps as my normal Size 6 and they fit like gloves! I'm ready to spend a day wearing these pumps and then meet some friends afterwards -- yes, these shoes are that comfortable. The black version is a staple to any wardrobe, but I'm ready to order one or two more pairs in different colors."
3,Narrow!,I wear a medium width but this shoe is way too narrow! It is a beautiful shoe and the quality is nice. I was in a bind and had to wear them or I would have returned them. Maybe a wide would be alright.
5,Awesome shoe,Love this pair. cool color. dark enough for winter but bright enough for summer. comfortable for a high heel. shipped very fast.
3,too large for small feet,"i ordered a size smaller: i am a 5 1/2 and ordered 5. they look good, fit almost ok but in the back, at the ankle, it's loose. when i walk it comes out of my feet. they really look nice but i think you have to have a wider feet and ankle."
3,"Great Look, Comfort Not So Much!","I love the look of these shoes, but it is not possible to wear them for long periods of time without significant foot pain. If you are on your feet all day, skip these, but for sitting they will get you compliments."
3,Ran big,I did not love the curve at the front of the shoe and my ankles pulled up when I tried to walk in the shoe. I'm returning.
2,Meh,They look hot but..... They were very stiff and the toes were very stubby looking. I believe I ordered a size 9. They were the correct size but very uncomfortable. I did send them back. I had no trouble retuning them. The size chart did help me to accurately know what size to get.
4,Very Very Comfortable,"I bought this shoe for work, and it is reeaaallllllyyyyyyyy comfortable, its nice and padded on the inside so my feet don't hurt at the end of the day. I've had it for a few months now and there are no signs of wear on it, its great!"
3,Good for the price I paid,"These are really cute shoes - they elongate your leg and are relatively comfortable considering the 4-inch heel on them. However, on my first trip out wearing them, I got a huge scratch on the left shoe that revealed a white patch under the faux blue patent. Uggh! So now, I can only wear these with pants! I say, worth it if on sale (which thank goodness, I got it at 50% off) but definitely not worth buying at full price, at least not the faux patent ones."
4,GREAT SHOES THAT MAKE YOUR LEGS LOOK GREAT!,"The only reason I didn't give these pumps a five is because I wore them to work and could barely walk by the end of the day. Granted they were brand new, and were comfortable enough to start with, so I think it's just me not being used to wearing such high heels all day long. They look great, but if you're used to flats and low heels like I am, these might not be the most comfortable choice."
4,Runs a little big,Love these shoes!! They have somewhat of a cusioned insoles which makes them comfortable. The only downside is that they do run a little big.
5,Love,Surprisingly comfy and wearable for 4 inch heels. Both stylish and wearable. Not so extreme that they can't be worn for everyday business.
1,QUALITY OF SERVICE,"I read the reviews but I still purchased these shoes from Comet in Florida. The shoe itself was really good quality, but the size 9 I order was a little too tight and I returned them for a larger size. On yesterday, 10/4/10 I received an email returning my monies for the shoes even though I requested a larger size. There service is very poor. I guess Amazon has spoiled me because when I order from them it seems like I get the product in a one to two day timeframe. I order this shoe on 9/3/10 and received them two weeks later. I would not recommend buying from them especially if you are in a hurry to receive. I even sent them an email with no reply or should I say a standard email reply that they would get back to me in 48 hours, didn't happen."
2,Not so brand new shoe,"I was disappointed in the pair that I received. They looked worn except for the bottom of the heels. A bit discolored, creases and a slight spot that appeared like it was exposed to heat. However the return was simple enough and I received another pair the following week. But unfortunately slight creases or wrinkles were noticeable and scratches or scuffs. I wiped them down with leather cleaner / conditioner which hep restore them a bit. Another issue is they scuff very easily. I kept them anyway."
5,as psychotic as the movie,Buy or die by maniac ! Ultimate soundtrack to be murdered by (ha !). If you have seen the movie that the early synthesized music will grab u by the nutz.
3,Okay product but will look for others,Product works like decribed but does require some effort and time.You have to thoroughly work the cleaning substance onto the surface for it to really start working. For extremely dirty cymbals a second application will be necessary.The cleaning substance will remove logos and any painted marking off your cymbals.Don't forget to shake the bottle well before using.
1,Please don't waste money,"I can't believe how Zildjian made this terrible product. It messed up my cymbals by creating thick and greasy dark dust spots on them. There is no way to polish or clean the cymbals unless you have an auto polishing machine. Go with the groove juice, 100 times better. I threw away this thing to the garbagge."
5,Truly Infectious!,"""The Invisible Enemy"" offers a thorough and useful approach to virology without using excessive amounts of medical and scientific jargon. It is especially useful to those of us who have experienced a lapse in time since studying formal virology or medical microbiology. This book is an entertaining overview of several of the more recent discoveries in the field of virological infectious disease. It should be of interest to any student of the physical sciences, or researchers/practicioners of the medicinal craft."
4,team work,"I have 8 of Rodney Yee's viedos,I feel he does a wonderful job expressing his yoga practices and his explinations of the different poses. He emphasizes how important it is to allow your breath and body to connect as one. Some of the poses are difficult but with props and listening to your inner body and breathing, they are all obtainable. Patrica Walden too, gives great instructions, the only problem I find is my own frustration because I have so much tightness and am a lot less flexiable, then I remind myself that I am only a beginner and that helps me continue my practices. I think they are very inspirational! Good luck! Namasta."
2,It was... ok.,"Sonia Singh came up with some great characters -- the uncle, ""Daddy,"" the Bollywood star and his family. The characters were worthy of a better book. The author touches on some interesting points, that India is not a third world country -- there are two Indias, rich and poor, living together. I enjoyed when she spoke about Bollywood films as an escape for those in poverty.The scene in which the Reena gets her revenge was, to be blunt, ridiculous, if not for her actions, then for the speech she gives.This book was an entertaining read, but it could have been so much better."
5,Excellent resource!,"This book provides a concise and easy-to-follow understanding of the CPS process. It not only provides step-by-step guidance through the process, explaining each piece, but for visual learners, the graphics are a great help! I use this book for my CPS class and the students have all been very positive about it as resource they plan to keep and share with their colleagues."
3,SO...,"Once I got into this book (past the kindergarten intro), I realized I already knew all of these exercises from my Group Dynamics course 20 years ago!! There is nothing new in this book at all. I was hoping for something I could use with my students...oh well...glad I got it used!"
4,CoStarring Miss Bellum ...,"Best cartoon on the video is ""Something's a Ms.,"" which mearks the return of Sedusa, and a new side of Miss Bellum that we have never seen. Miss Bellum fans will really rejoice with this collection, as the double episode ""Criss Cross Crisis"" puts Blossom into Miss Bellum's body. Of course, Bubbles ends up in the Mayor's body, and that's ... just ... not right. Worst cartoon of the lot is ""The Mane Event,"" where Blossom learns to never let her sisters cut her hair. An intriguing villain, but way too many bad puns associated with it. The new cartoon ""Power Lunch"" is boffo, with the Gangrene Gang getting superpowers from irridated convenience store food. Only real bummer is that they picked a so-so Dexter's Lab cartoon - ""Dexter's Lab: A Story"" - for the bonus 'toon. Still, one of the best videos in the PPG collection."
5,Great compact book!,This book is not about the 4Ps of marketing. It's a compact book about market management strategies. You only need to spend 5 minutes on a chapter and you'll get key valuable information. Like it.
4,Great start,This book is a great start for me to revisit what I learned some 25 years ago. It compliments my class textbook.
5,great,Product arrived quicker than deadline. In the shape advertised. I am very pleased with the vendor.I would use them again.
4,The Promised Land Review,"I enjoyed this book a lot also. From slavery to migrating to Chicago, I learned a lot about the African-American experience.This book has shown me the many obstacles that my people have had to overcome and has taught me to be so thankful for those who fought for rights for African-Americans so I would have a better experience than they had growing up in America. It has also shown me why Blacks are still not seen on the same level playing field as Whites today.Even though this book is factual it reads more like a novelin that it includes excerpts about the lives of many Blacks growing up back then.The video series that goes along with this book also adds a personal feel to the novel. This video series is a must for every families video collection."
1,Must to avoid.,"An interesting concept: Todd hands his vocal masters from some of his biggest hits and most endearing misses to the folks at Cleopatra records and sez: ""do what you will."" Problem is that with few exceptions (Skip Heller for instance) the mixologists Cleopatra bothered to ask have very little to offer. Hardcore Todd is Godd folks think of the project as sacriligious. Your average Todd fan will think it pointless (come on, is playing ""Drunken Blue Rooster"" and ""Lord Chancellor's Nightmare Song"" concurrently really worth recording? Sheesh.) And anybody in the electronica world will think it all silly (too much melody, not enough riveting beats.)"
1,Not Todd's fault- this is crapola!,"Before I opened up the hermedically sealed child-proof CD, I just knew that there were going to be some respectful and tasteful reconstructions of some cool Todd. Man, was I wrong! Todd, you can't be so happy with this, can you? I was waiting for the magnificent bridge in ""Drive"", arguably a great pop bridge for the ages, and.......nothing!!I had high hopes, but, alas, this was crash and burn. For a great ""reconstruction"", check out Alison Kraus' ""Would'nt have made any difference""."
2,Inadequare packaging,"As pictured, the ink cartridges come in boxes. When the package arrived, it was a manila envelope with 10 ink cartridges and NO cartridge boxes. I consider this deceptive advertising, since the boxes WERE pictured, and I don't recall any text saying that they would not be included. When buying as many as 10 cartridges, the ability to store these cartridges for future use is IMPORTANT. Without the boxes, the wrappers could be easily punctured and the ink dry out. The shipping envelope would not have prevented the cartridges from being crushed and broken. I have purchased these cartridges before- from a seller on eBay - for an equivalent price, and they were shipped adequately and in individual boxes."
1,Wrong product was sent,Thre ink cartdidges that i ordered were to be for a canon printer. What I received must have been something they had just laying around. It wasn't even close. I ended up haveing to go to a local store as i use this printer for my consulting business.
4,Vintage Fatigue Shirt,"I do like the OD fatigue shirt, but I thought it was a vintage shirt, not one made in china. You're posting says ""Vintage"" but should say ""Made in China""."
3,Good addition ? Yes. Perhaps.,"Good Day. And, good music measures after good, please.Not=Remember the Normandy Belt class-struggles, please.Not=Judgmental with the 3.0 star rating, please.This is supposed to be a good North America after good, please. With the smaller, English language, mind you. As dour and daunting: As this music composition-packaging cover is...hmm...okay. Good-to-go now. To make a [shh...a Cadillac] story short, (yes) there are some tracks, and subsequent hearing-thoughts' clues that I appreciated. To keep good after good going - and on the make with that, in-mind.Ascerbic stuff - with the audio CD technology - these writs are not as contrived as (may/may not) appear. Stay away from that middle-class buffet line...all of the time...mind you !Good Day."
2,Soul Asylum doesn't rock,"When this album was out, I was friends with this guy who would periodically exclaim ""SOUL ASYLUM ROCKS"" like maybe he was talking about Iron Maiden or Living Color or something. So I let him play this for me. As he banged his head and played a mean hard air guitar, I listened to some of the tamest bop I ever had to sit through. Some of the songs are pretty, but they have no heart. Unless you are already a fan (God help you) don't bother with this album."
2,pretentious rehash,"every thing here is old. every convention is used. the dialogue is so clumsy as to be laughable. trying to keep track of who is alive and dead is ridiculous. i wonder if this is not one of those books, written as a joke by various authors, each playing with the concept of serial murders. that would explain the confusion between chapters, and the lack of consistency in explaining who the killers are, where they are, which houses they may or may not live in, and even their description.""naked came the serial murder"". that should have been the title."
5,baby anne left us hanging there for a while..but this cd !!,"Finally! we get our old baby anne back. I saw her spin at a place called the tabernacle in atlanta, which i believe has since been shut down...anyhow..the atlanta crowd was completely not feeling her break beats and she got pissed. it was great because she really started mixing some dark stuff..i loved it. i'm from florida, so baby anne is a staple on the scene here..I think Mixtress is her best release to date."
4,still impressing,"DJ Baby Anne's first album was earth moving. One had to have the amps and bass speakers to be able to get all the tones of bass from the album. Absolutely impressive. She continues her trend in this album the Mixtress with similar style but instead of every song being a audible wonder, there's about 4 or 5 songs on this album with the energy, tempo and power to make ones feet and body move. Great bass lines once again and great to hear some good songs from this genre."
4,nice :),"this cd is pretty dope (im listening to it as we speak :)...it has alot of of scratching on it which is pretty dope ...a true turntablist :). its not to dark...i like it ! enta da dragon is a dope track, check it out i think its number 6. number 9 is my fave tho, to bad you cant sample it :*(. anyway this cdz kewl...i think dj dara is better tho...hez the phattest jungle dj around, aite peace n lOve JungleGIRL"
1,Amazon Needs To Update,"Do not buy this pin with the combo offered on the bike rack. As I found out, to late, the pin offered by Amazon is the wrong pin and will not work. The bike rack manufacturer uses a specifically designed bolt style pin making this pin unusable. Wait until you get the bike rack and if you do not care for the pin supplied you can order a locking bolt pin from the internet or pick one up at u-haul or someplace else that deals in hitches."
5,Incredible for a sports game.,"Being a female, I usually don't like sports games but this game is easy to learn and is lots of fun. There are lots of extras that you have to earn as you play the game and that's always a plus. You can also save a game at any time so you can just sit down and play a few holes or play a whole 18 hole game."
5,GREATEST GOLF GAME EVER!,"DO NOT be fooled by the cartoon characters. This is the best golf game I'm ever played (accurate wind, shots, tournaments; classic characters; easy to learn; online tournaments). It's easy to play, and the courses range from very easy to virtually impossible. There are limitless possibilities of play (such as stroke, tourney, mini-golf, match, slots, skins, more) on six full courses and two nine hole minigolf courses. If you know some basic stuff about golf, you will love this awesome game."
2,Mutations of Reality,"The book Mutations By Robin Cook is a basic medical thriller where a doctor mutates his son and throughout the book, in a variety of ways, it backfires on him. The characters in this book would be good, if they were believable. Take for instance VJ. A normal 11 year old boy would not have done most of the things he does in the book. However the book does have some very believable characters, like the mother. She is always worrying about how her kid is really smart and is always going to work with his dad when he can. His mom thinks that even though he's really smart he should still spend time with kids his own age. Throughout the book Cook uses a lot of description. For example, Cook always named street signs and exits. I understand that Cook is just trying to make it easier for the reader to create a mental picture in their head, but really all that detail is beside the point! The ending was kind of crazy and out there but, hey so was the whole book!"
2,What was Cook thinking?,"Dr. Robin Cook may be a good author but after reading ""Mutation"" you would never image that to be true. The far-fetched and unrealistic plot made it hard for the reader to believe that such events could take place. Not to mention the characters are ridiculous. Vj, and eleven year old boy, accomplishes more than most highly educated adults could ever image to be possible. The plot and characters display issues but then there is the problem with the extreme amount of detail. Highway exits, street names, and the weather are all examples of this detail that is just thrown in adding no real importance to the novel. All of this tied in with the heavy foreshadowing of the ending just leaves one sad story. Cook may written some decent novels in his time but ""Mutation"" is defiantly not one of them....What was he thinking???"
2,Good story-Bad writing,"This book The Mutation, by Robin Cook, started out with such amazing promise. It had all the qualifications of a great book. It had a good story line of a mad scientist genetically altering his own child in order to make him the smartest man on the planet, a sort of frankenstein remake. It also had a good setting. The lab where the scientist goes mad is beautifully laid out. Plenty of room for mischief. Somewhere Mr. Cook lost his way though. He got too caught up in giving all these elaborate scientific terms and directions to places that we really don't need to know. I mean why would i care what highway exit somebody had to take to get to a place that really adds nothing to the story line at all. He lost me between that and the part where the 10 year old genious slash drug lord ends up killing people. Im sorry to say this but this isn't a ""scientific thriller"", it is a ""scienfic bummer."""
1,easy read with no real purpose,"Dr. Robin Cook author of the scientific fiction novel Mutation seems to think it is interesting enough to write a whole book about genetic research. Not only does he write about genetic research but also introduces a chaotic family into his crazy story. It was not realistic or engaging and seems not to stretch the reader's disbelief. Which are essential traits of science fiction novels. Unfortunately this story had no definite theme because of the jumping from thought to thought. Science experiments would be a main discussion while family values would be present, making a theme hard to identify. The characters are also very unrealistic from both the science and family view of the story. For example a prodigy child created by his fathers experiments and mother who has no idea what is going on in her baby's life. Mutation is an easy read but not a suggested one if you like your story to capture your imagination."
4,Intense Action !,"A page turner ! I simply couldn't put it down ! I even found myself reading it under lamposts while walking back from work (evening shift). I just had to find out about the faith of Dr Marissa Blumenthal ! OUTBREAK was my introduction to Mr Cook's work, and I was not disappointed, though I must admit that I figured out mid-through who the bad guys were. Also, I sometimes got confused as to who was who (too many damn doctors !). But the fast-moving plot and the sustaining suspense kept me on the edge of my seat ! And the topic. What an horrifying one it is ! Just writing about it gives me goosebumps ! I encourage anyone to read OUTBREAK. It is a well-deserved best seller !-------M. Boucher"
2,Mutations Review By Robin Cook,Mutations by Robin Cook is a medical thriller of a young boy who had great knowlege in science. After trying to follow in the foot steps of his father he built a secret under ground laboratory and was a drug dealer to pay for it. In my eyes the book was very un believable and irrational. The scientific terms used in mutations were heard to understand and much of the story seemed very unreal. I won't ever pick up another Robin Cook novel to read his style of writing isn't for me. If you like to read medical thrillers this novel is going to be perfect for you.
2,"Mutation good? Yeah right, try again.","I think it was Lamar from Reading Rainbow that said ""Everytime you open a book, you open a new and better world"". After reading Mutation, I am saying he is wrong. It was not a new world and definitly not a better one.This book was a direct, ahem, mutation of the original Frankenstein. For instance, Dr. Victor Frank. It doesn't take a genious to figure out that Frank is a direct allusion to Frankenstein. Dr. Frank then makes his ""monster"" but this time in the form of a son. His son goes onto to poision (actually give liver cancer) to his brother, teacher, and nurse, all because they found out about his underground lab. Speaking of the underground lab, VJ cured infertility, making women pregnant with his dads sperm and how does he pay for it? With drug money. Sound impossible? He did all this before the age of 11. I dont recommend this book to anyone and feel sorry for those who did read this. I also apologize to Robin Cook for writing this."
2,Too Long & Boring,"""Mutation"" by Robin Cook is a scientific thirller that isn't one of his best books. Long drug out descriptions, big complication medical terms, and many unrealistic events. A 10 year old boy manufacturing his own drugs and housing his own secret laboratory and cloning people? Come on, give me a break. This is a poorly designed book and I give it a two-star rating."
3,Give it a shot,"Robin Cook wrote a scientific thriller about a fathers experiment gone wrong. A lot of the theme is about revenge, because every time someone crosses VJ the wrong way they end up with major problems. The characters add to the book because they are so easy for the reader to relate with. For example everyone can relate with a VJ's mother because she just wants her kid to be normal like all the other kids. The book does sometimes drag on with too many scientific words, but all books have flaws. Mutation is an easy read that most people should enjoy."
4,I found a big mistake in this book,"Every time I read a book of Robin Cook I hate all kinds of doctors, you don't know what can be true in the field of investigation. But this book has a big mistake, this mistake is that VJ only has 11 years and he made a laboratory by himself, sell drugs, and have a big team working for him and nobody knew it, that can be true only if Dr. Cook change VJ's age to 20 years, then everything could be possible and then this book will be a 5 stars book.Taking that away with the explanation of the ADN formulas that I didn't understood, this is an easy book to read it will keep you interested in the story."
2,TWO maby THREE maby TWO and 1/2 stars...at the most?,"From the cover of 'Mutation' by Robin Cook it's common to gather that it is yet another easy read science fiction book full of cliche plot twists and bland characters, the kind of story that you would see in a made for tv movie on the sci-fi channel. While delving into the wonders of this book, by chapter five one finds themselves envying VJ who is reading a book about black holes. The mindless plotline and wordy technical descriptions create an unbalance that throws the reader off; sending them on a downward spiral leading to an unsatisfying finish. Even though this book has a breif amount of entertainment value, it does not deserve to be a ""new york times best seller."""
4,A Work of Art,"Books are like art works because they require a great amount of detail and personal attention. A common problem with some books today, is the overzealous amount of description, nonsensical details, and not an ample amount of characterization- the complete opposite of Mutation. In this medical thriller, by Robin Cook, the suspenseful story line had the ability to keep one engaged in the book, as a painter to his work. In the novel, Cook is the painter creating a beautiful work of art that can be experienced repeatedly. In conclusion, despite common misconceptions of over descriptive details, one could find Mutation to be a well written novel."
5,Great information!,"Some comments below complain that the vocabulary is too advanced- well, that may be true but personally that's what I want in an upper-level textbook!Very accurate and a true asset to any student or mental health professional. Highly recommended!"
5,"Sony quality, but not good human factor design","What I really like about this CD clock radio is that it is completely digital, e.g., radio tuning, volume. There are several controls on the sides and you have to turn the radio to see what they are until you learn to feel for them. Why didn't they put an earphone jack in? I don't like that the ac power adapter is hard-wired, doesn't plug in like every other product I've seen with an ac power adapter. The sound quality if good. Overall, its a super full featured CD/clock radio."
3,Difficult Alarm,"I am finding it difficult to figure out the alarm setup in this model. It goes off at noon daily and finding the button to shut off is not so easy. For Sony, not their usual quality. The case is poorly designed. Disappointed in my purchase."
1,Should have been better -- weak alarm and confusing,Had hoped for a quality unit but whoever designed the controls never had to use it. Totally non intuitive.Alarm is NO where near loud enough for anyone but the lightest sleeper.Tried to go to bed listening to a cd and let it run out. Then woke up late because the alarm didn't go off.Try again Sony!
3,a good value for the price,"I chose this product for its stylish design and size. It is very easy to use; one can manage the On-OFF-Volume buttons even in the dark. Being a Sony, I assumed the sound would be good. This is the only aspect which does not please me as much as my previous CD-radio. The speakers are on the sides which does not direct the sound out into the room as well."
5,Best alarm clock I have ever had.,"Loaded with options. Good sound for its size. When using the CD for alarm, you can select what track to play and set the volume. It can be set to be very dim too, so it won't bother the light sleeper. I burnt my own CD with my favorite tunes and I can change which tune to wake up every no and then. Great purchase."
2,Waste of money,"My daughter got this as a gift for Christmas and I wish she hadn't! The idea itself is pretty cool, a singing barbie styling head with a microphone, sounds great. But what you don't realize until you open it and play with it is, the moving motion of the barbie's jaw makes a loud clicking sound which makes it annoying to listen to the singing. There IS a volume control on this toy, it's located directly on the front (it's leaf shaped). But the clicking sound is still just as loud. And there are random voices during the song, from what I assume is supposed to be the other animals that are attached to the barbie head, but their mouths don't move so it seems a little creepy. My daughter played with it once and tossed it aside."
3,Barbie singing head,I was not keen on getting this for my 7 yo daughter but she really wanted it for Xmas...she has not used it as much as I would have liked her to...after a few dys it went in the corner.
5,Very enjoyable,"This is part one of a combination interview, music special. The backgrounds of the group each other and the songs make a learning experience of their Gospel side. From beginning to what they are doing now nine years after retirement. Best to have both for the full Statler Brothers Gospel experience."
5,Excellent primer,"This is an excellent book for those new to the business. I've shown this book to several mortgage company owners and they all wanted to borrow it! I would of given it four stars because of it's lack depth on discussing marketing, however the rest of the material more than makes up for it. The author was also nice enough to respond to my questions via email. The book is well worth the price. I went ahead and bought his next book ""The Millionaire Mortgage Broker"". Let's just hope its just as good."
3,Review for Native Amercan Toy Set,"Although my granddaughter has repeatedly asked me for some Indians with a tepee, she really doesn't play with this item very much. It's cute except it's not realistic. The Plains Indians did not have Totem Poles."
5,Great Family Movie!,This is a great family movie. My 6 and 4 year old both love it and I actually enjoy watching it with them. It is very cute and there are not any scary parts if you have kids that get scared easily in movies.
1,Yo quiero my money back,"If you want a review that is short and sweet and at leasthalf-funny, see the title of this review, because heythat's not lazy at all is it?"
5,DOGS DOGS Gotta love them,"My husband and I watched this and laughed alot. Those puppies are so adorable. You have to be a dog person to enjoy and appreciate this. I just love puppies, and the voices were good.Joyce"
4,Much better than Reviews suggest,I just watched this movie last night and it was so cute and funny. So what if most of the actors are different than the first one. It isn't as ggood as the first one but it's still better than people have been saying.
5,The beginning of all stories,"Over the years I've read a lot of stories which claim to take place in the first of all worlds, the origin of dreams. Almost without exception they are standard roadside attractions on the Fantasy Tour.John Wright has avoided this trap. His writing style evokes Dunsany, Clark Ashton Smith, Lovecraft's Kadath, and Eddison. Without ever saying ""Look at how clever and well-read I am"" he mixes fairy tales, the Mahabarta, occult imagery and our deepest fears in a seamless way.And this is all in the first sixty pages.I feared, at the end of The Golden Transcendence, that Wright was a one-hit wonder. Those fears have been most joyously laid to rest."
2,Casual security - but easily defeated,"Last week I went to hitch up to my trailer and could not find the key to this lock. Imagine my surprise, when my cordless dremel cut through the shackle in under 5 seconds. I'm looking for a more secure replacement."
4,Excellent bag!,"Works really fine for what it's meant to be! A little side pocket to put a filter and spare memory stick would be nice, but is missing. The one I had for my Sony DSC-H1 had it... maybe you should buy the new A100 bag instead!"
2,doesnt fit,Doesn't fit on my rifle. Rugar 10/22. Looks nice if it were to fit though. I will keep it in case I get another gun.
4,Good design and easy to use - not universal fit.,"With a 3-digit combination, this lock is better used to protect against accidental (read kids') use rather than theft/illegal use. In my view, the lock successfully achievies this purpose. The lock is much easier to use than the cable locks typically supplied with new firearms.The lock has sliding little plastic ""knobs"" as well as softer stationary ""spikes"" to keep it in position. On my lock, the little knobs have a tendency to stick. It is not a big deal, just something to mention.Also, on my Glock 30, positioning the lock is a bit difficult - it helps to dry-fire and leave the trigger in the back position - not a fault of the lock itself, just be aware that fit may not be universal.Overall, I would recommend this lock for anyone with children or under statutory requirements to secure firearms."
5,Exactly what I needed,"No need to look for keys to unlock the gun if you need it quick. Worked great, fits my subcompact, my XDM and an AR-15."
4,Works,Simple to use but wouldn't clip on my XD9 with a light attachment. I remove the light attachment when i go to the range so it works fine when its off.
1,Not good,This lock jammed immediately when I tried to change the default combination. I would hate to think it would jam when it counted most. Not recommended.
3,Master gun lock but not for loaded guns,"After getting the lock, I see on the front label that it's NOT for use on a loaded gun. Kind of defeats the purpose of a gun lock, in my opinion. I haven't even used this one yet and got a small handgun sized lock box instead."
5,Small gems for liquids.,"With so many reviews, it is hard to imagine saying anything new, except perhaps to rebuttal the fellow who said they clogged up when used with ground spices. I suggest that the selling points do make a point of saying they are for liquids, and I would agree they would not work well with very thick liquids such as molasses or honey.I got these because I recognized the name of the manufacturer as a product name which makes laboratory grade plastic items. That tells me that even if useability is limited, the quality of the plastic is top notch, which it is. If you were to choose between this set and a metal set also marketed by Norpro, I suggest the plastic, which are larger. The only exception, which was one of my interests, is if you want to use a funnel to fill lanterns or other gas powered devices with white gas, kerosene or other flammable liquid, which may possibly soften some plastics."
4,ok,"seems fine, although I would have liked it better if the funnels were larger size and had wider openings, to flow faster."
2,its early to say...,"i dont think he had quite gotten the hang of it when he made this album, it seems to be lacking in comparison to ""Night Ripper"" or ""Feed The Animals"". I liked it to some extent but it got really repetitive and even annoying at some points. It's not barable but if you're going to buy an album from him, i'd say go with one of the other two."
2,Nope,"The samples didn't do this album the terrible justice it deserved.LOVE Feed the Animals, but no, no thank you to this."
1,Absolute Total Dreck!,I agree that this is horrible! I absolutely love the books and the first two movies. Both books and and those two movies are beautiful works of art but the third movie is crap! It's a stinker and absolute dreck!
5,Great Album!! (Definately a Must Have!!),"I LOVED ""Born to Do it"" and thought ""Slicker than Your Average"" was a little step down but still great. And now, ""The Story Goes..."" is AWESOME! He is definately doin' it again much better than his second album. I can't stop myself from promoting this album to everyone I can. Even my friends are gettin hooked on to C-R-A-I-G. This albums is definately a must have and is going to remain a classic album, just like the first."
5,O'Cedar Light & Thirsty Mop Refill,Have used this product many times and have been very happy with it. My only complaint is that I have trouble finding it in the stores. Seems I will be ordering it on line from now on.Thank you!
5,Light@Thirsty Mop and Refill,Great way to efficiently clean effectively. Picks up the finest particles and leaves a clean that lasts.
3,Not sure if this is a glitch ?,"I bought this cable and tried,the first time i plugged it in it worked like a charm, but after that it seems like its working intermittently only when i connect in a certain way...meaning i have to tweak it a little to get my ipod charging. i am not sure if this is a cable fault? but overall i am not very happy with this."
4,"Great overall movie, not much action","First off I want to say that I totally enjoyed this film. Than let me say if you only watch the Hong Kong movies to see fights do not buy this movie. Don't be fooled by the name there are about two fights in this film. The rest of the film is funny and romantic. Dragon 9 is really the central character. He is really funny, but if you don't like Hong Kong humor you won't agree with me. The women are beautiful the men are tough and graceful, and overall this film hits every major theme love,action, and humor. This film is very entertaining and actually has a decent script. It is like a whodunit that actually has a good third act. If you watch Hong Kong film to be entertained, not just blown away by fighting than buy this movie right away it is really entertaining. If you want to just see a lot of fighting buy Iron Monkey, or Tai chi master also great movies."
2,Not Worth It,"Three hundred pages of generalities, very little specific. 1200 pages of appendix. The book was over price, considering it is really nothing more than a dictionary of air quality compliance and permitting. The chapters and topics over and over suggest the topic at hand is complicated and changing and to variable to go into specifics. For 90 dollars and 1500 pages I want to know specifics for different processes, at different levels, in different regions, in different states. On page three he suggests that if you are looking for a book that covers every possible contingency this book is not for you...he is correct...yet the book should be renamed to 'If You Are In Business, You Can't Afford Not To Hire Someone That Can Understand Air-Quality Compliance...But Not Write A Comprehensive Text On The Subject in 1500 Pages or Less""."
2,not happy with this one,this was my first t.v. gamei love wheel of fortune but this game don't work well on my big screen tv can't really see the wheel very clear. and the pizzle is at the top and bottom of my tv........j.green
1,"Sicklied o'er with the pale cast of naught...or, An Afternoon Crap","A seam of phoniness runs through this prosaic midden like a seam of gravel and sand in a guano mine. These are tawdry, orphaned paragraphs with no visible means of support, strutting around town in their mentoring overalls, hammering away at their always-bogus magical realism composed of cheap lumber infested with 27 termites. The entire collection reeks with the stench of slowly evaporating embalming fluid while it embarrasses the occasional conscious reader with its contrived exhibitions of forced benevolence and the kind of deep thought prevalent among extinct tribes of pygmys. The overarching earnestness is stifling--an evening of dental surgery without aesthetics."
4,Travel guide,The information seems to be quite complete and is well presented. The book also has its lighter side. Good value for the visitor lucky enough to get to this part of Scotland.
2,Goofed,"I goofed ordering this item, but I'm keeping it anyway. Next time, I'll make sure there's is a PICTURE of the product before placing an order.My bad."
3,Recycled,"The music is great, but I already have all of it, and have had this in some cases for decades. North Star has been available since the 70's and one can still procure it online. Dressed Like an Egg is nothing more, as best I can tell, than Another Look at Harmony, Part IV, which was released a few years ago on CD. Mad Rush has also been around for ages, and certainly isn't a significant piece.So the music's great, but this album is misleading. None of this is ""analog,"" in any sense of the word. Nor is it newly discovered music or even newly released music."
1,Joe Hindman,"CAUTION! This is advertised as a ""solar powered"" watch. It is NOT. It has a battery just like all electric watches and NO solar charging. Battery must be replaced every 2 years according to the user's manual.I was also unable to get it to accept my time zone... try as I might the directions that are provided didn't work on my watch.And I agree that the watchband is not adjustable in any reasonably easy fashion.Basically this watch is junk and stay away!Joe"
5,Casio Atomic Waveceptor Wristwatch,"Casio Men's Atomic Waveceptor Silver-Tone Watch #VQ202HDA-2BVCFGood looking watch. Excellent price compared to local retail stores.Well described in nomenclature, and good picture."
2,WAY TOO LONG,"High quality, wrong length. These screws are way too long for any of my cars license plates. Most plate screws are 0.25 inches, these are ~ 0.75. Won't fit anything I own."
5,A fusion of funk and hard-core. Definitely worth checking.,You don't have to be a fan of Suicidal to dig this band. Their grooves are original and jamming! I have nothing but positive comments for their efforts. A hybrid of funk and metal - with a bit of humor spliced within.
2,Careful...It causes weight gain,"I bought this for hormone balancing and within two days, I gained weight with no rhyme or reason. Upon researching the product further online (looking up the words ""maca, weight gain"") apparently maca is used for people LOOKING to gain weight. While this isn't a dealbreaker for all, it is a dealbreaker for me so I never got to explore the hormone balancing effects of this product since I threw it away after 3 days (and lost the weight almost immediately)."
5,a fun read,"I am a big fan of this show and was delighted to read some of the behind the scenes stories. I wish they had written a bit more, especially close encounters with some of the more dangerous animals. The pictures are gorgeous. Overall, well worth the price."
3,JUST SOUND LIKE THE MOVIE!,"If you love ROTLD3 then I suggest that this soundtrack is worth having. I find soundtracks are different when listened to on their own. I liked this music score. Inside the cover there's a nice note from Director Brian Yuzna on the film, and some colored pics of Julie. Awesome."
3,Sticky start/stop button,"I bought one of these for my daughter (13) & one for me. My daughter doesn't like using hers, but I like keeping track of my reading per day & how long it takes to complete each book that I read. I don't know why, I'm just strange like that! Anyway, the bookmark seems to be pretty durable because I read on my front porch quite a bit and it has fallen onto the concrete several times and has not cracked or appear damaged in any way. The only complaint I have is that the start/stop button is finicky. You have to push it just right or it doesn't obey. Sometimes I think it's on, but it's not or vice-versa."
4,"Nice product, overpriced","This product works exactly as described. You can cumulatively time up, set a timer to count down, or just have it in clock mode.It seems very durable to me.Be aware that the packaging indicates this item sells for $9, so I thought a $14 price tag was a bit overpriced."
4,"Great tool, came with dead battery","These are very helpful in tracking reading minutes for school. My responsible 10 year old son has made great use of his. One of them arrived with a dead battery, which was slightly annoying."
3,"Works, has issues.","This lock works well, with quirks.1) The key is hard to turn. Yeah, my bike locked up at the grocery store. Took a good 15 minutes of fidgeting to get it to work. When I got home, I sprayed WD40 into the lock, operates smoothly ever since.2) The lock rattles in the mount when riding. I got fed up with it and used a Velcro strap to hold it against the frame. No problems.3) Bike insurance is a scam. Kryptonite does full lifetime warranty, even if it is a bit sketchy. Master Lock I think does only a year. Don't know how that makes sense.I lost my key and had my bike briefly stolen before security found it locked across a parking lot and behind a building, so now I need a new lock. Just not this one, I'll try a different one this time."
2,Such potential!,"I agree with the reader from Seattle. This book had such potential. After the first few pages, I was unable to put it down. I couldn't wait to get to the ending - to bring the whole story together, but it just didn't happen. All through the book I was formulating endings...she's a twin, she's really Jo, it was all a dream...and then the end comes. What a disappointment! I was really hoping for a more clever ending."
2,Really Over the Top,"I could not wait for this to be over. I got sick of hearing the term on my cassette, ""do you see what I mean""? This character is such a bubble head. The plot itself is completely unbelievable. Maybe women will like this story better than I do as a man, but this is just pure drivel."
4,Pretty good,"This was a pretty good book but the ending was kind of a let down in that it really wasn't very dramatic. The climax was just kind of ho-hum, we got that over with. On the plus side, this novel really did hold my interest throughtout. I thought I figured out who the bad guy was but was wrong...Way off in fact. Truth is there is no way to know who the bad guy is ahead of time. I guess that kind of takes the mystery out of it a bit. I did like reading a mystery/thriller in the first person. It seemed to make it more intense even if some of the language was a little hard to believe. (some of Abbie's personal thoughts)The characters seemed pretty believable and I would for sure read more works by Nicci French. In fact, I may order a couple more right now."
4,Like it,We're quite satisfied with this product.It's what it says and rather attractive with its styling.Only one or two very minor quibbles with the ways alarms and the snooze bar function but that's more to do with personal preferences than any real problems - tomayto/tomahto as they say.One main reason for buying was the need for an early morning alarm which it does to our satisfaction and the big time display is great for when you want catch a quick peek at the time during the night.I don't find it too bright as some others do.The power output was a pleasant surprise and it may now double as a music source for some children sessions at church.
2,Disappointed,"This is a very attractive machine, and it worked very well...for a while, maybe 4 months. Then, one day, no power at all to the unit. Sony would have taken it back, but unfortunately for me, I stupidly threw the receipt away, never thinking that I would need it on a Sony product. Oh, well, live and learn."
5,Awesome Durable RC Jet for the Price!!,"These are probably the most Durable and best of the Cheap Park Flying scale type Jets for what it is. Not to be compared to the AeroAce Biplane or AA-Jet ..they are a totally different experience ..the F-16 flies faster,higher and needs more room(Watch out for trees!) ..anticipate your turns ahead of time and (Important!)ALWAYS! Double Charge the NiMh batteries regardless of what the directions say(unplug and replug charger) and you'll have a fast,powerful,cheap yet durable Park Jet!! For more Info read the note in comments of this review.."
4,Great Movie for WWI Buffs,This is one of the best WWI movies to be made in a long time. I highly reccommend it. I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that it isn't edited very good. The orginal version is six hours long and they crammed it into two. There are scenes that are out of place and you can easily tell this by looking at the character's ranks. There is also hardly any transition between Gallipoli and France. Thats what happens when you condense a movie. Both of these are minor and maybe I am being nit picky. I have yet to see the full six hour version. I just recently ordered it. Once I view it I may edit this review.
3,"Music sounds Good, but video scenes change too often.","I really enjoyed the music, but the camera scences changed too much. The many color lighting was too much of a contrast. I really enjoyed the excitement of the audience and the lead singers."
1,Third movie very disappointing.,"I liked the Anne of Green Gables books and the first two movies but this latest movie was most unsatisfactory and it just had absolutely nothing to do with the books and very little to do with the first two movies and was just disappointing especially as I looked forward so much to watching this newest movie. I tried to like this movie, I really did try to give it a chance but I just didn't like it and I hope they make another movie that will truly capture the magic of L.M. Montgomery's vison of Anne."
2,Not Helpful/ Few Secrets,"This book could be good for a model wanna-be. It does have a chapter on shaping your eyebrows and waxing your legs - ouch! However, if you want useful recipes and remedies do not buy this book! The author's idea of a recipe for Foot-Soaking Fizzies is Alka Seltzer and your favorite essential oil. Her recipe for Aromatherapy Bath Salts is epsom salt, your favorite essential oil and food coloring! This book lacks useful information and only has a few recipes other than those listed on the back cover. Most ingredients are not natural and most of her ""secrets"" would irritate my sensitive skin."
5,I Am Who I Am,"I had never heard of Lara Fabian until one night when I was at my favorite dance club enjoying the hell out of myself and this wonderful, hair raising remix played!!! I can't describe the feeling that came over me. The hair on the back of my neck stood on end!! Her voice is remarkable and the lyrics are delicious!!! It really got me groovin'. It is now my personal anthem!!!! You Go Girl!!!!!!!!!!!Erik"
4,Why isn't this on DVD?,"For pity's sake, the other five Ustinov Poirots are on DVD...this is the only one that isn't. Come on already!"
3,"Good chick lit, infuriating main character/plot developments","So, I'm with Julie's friends on this on, she is way too picky. Some of the guys she dates are straight up horrible, but others she's just too stuck up and picky. I don't really know why anyone would want to be with her. I just felt like it was a little light on logic at times, and that we had to suffer through too many false starts with guys and bad dates and then we got to the end and it was just like, ""Eh, I'm gonna put her with this one."" I probably wouldn't recommend it to most people, but people who like things like ""He's Just Not That Into You"" or movies like ""Valentine's Day"" might enjoy this one."
3,Light and Fun Read,"First off, I want to say that I did enjoy reading this book despite what I am going to say. First off, I thought that the book was really predictable. Second, I kind of admire the main character for not just settling...in real life I see too many people marrying the wrong people just because they are tired of being alone and it is convenient. At the same time, the main character is the most annoying, snobby, conceited, clueless person. I really couldn't stand her. I kept secretly hoping for things to turn out badly for her...I think I'm much too nice though because I was happy with how it ended even though I had a feeling that it would end that way."
4,Almost as good as I remembered!,"Saber Rider was nearly as good as I remembered it being as a kid. I wasn't disappointed, like with some shows, where I had really fond memories, then learn that they were actually quite bad. It was fun to watch again"
2,The baddest Power Rangers finale? Yeah right!,"Of all the Power Rangers series ""Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue"" was the weakest. After a fantastic finale to Power Rangers In Space and Power Rangers Lost Galaxy, I expected the same from this. Not the case. In relation to the whole series, the finale isn't that bad, but it still left me very disappointed. Get it if your a fan of all Power Rangers, but if not, skip it."
2,Gypsy Music!,It is not exactly Gipsy music! This songs can be grouped together only because they go well with vodka!
2,A Dangerous Woman (A Fay Cunningham Mystery-Book 1),"This book had the potential to be a decent little mystery BUT ....! It was poorly written as to grammar and there was a recurring phrase""but this old gal this and this old gal that"" that was SO annoying that I had to keep putting the book down. And no one could be so clumsy and all in all it was a book I'm glad I got as a freebie or I'd want my money back!!!"
1,Nothing but cherry candy!,"These did nothing for my sore throat! I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between these, and cherry Life Savers. Do not buy these. I'll stick with Hall's from now on."
5,Addictive,"So apparently these have addictive properties, as i've met atleast 3 people now who claim to be addicted to these, or eat them like candy. I'm not sure if thats a good thing or not."
1,Unexpected 'extras',"The main poem/words of this book are not bad, though certainly more basic than I'd hoped. But what frustrated me is the fact that there are Bible verses at the end of each scenario! I was certainly not expecting this, and was annoyed that it wasn't mentioned in the book description. Whatever a family's spiritual inclination, it makes sense that parents should know before buying a book that lessons about God are included throughout!"
4,Tracy Montoya takes an exotic journey--into the heart.,"Isabela Santana has moved beyond the heartache Mateo Esquivel caused her, or so she thinks. She is forced to take on a co-director for her archaeological dig where she is searching for evidence of a female Mayan ruler. Isabela is angry enough to find out that her sexist superiors have chosen a man. She's horrified that it's Mateo. Mateo never understood why Isabela left without a word seven years ago, but he's determined to be with her now. Both Isabela and her project are in danger, and the same danger killed his mother three years ago when she was in pursuit of the same Mayan ruler, the Red Lady. He's determined to protect the dig... and Isabela, for his feelings never went away. Tracy Montoya has created a winner! At times both funny and poignant, the characters spring to life and engage the reader."
4,interesting and grows on you,"When I first received this CD, I thought what the heck did I buy? I am more fond of the acoustic, folkier African sound. So this one which includes electronic and fast pace threw me. It irritated me. However, now that I have played it at least 10 times, I like it. I think it is fun, creative, and quite loving. There is some native sound in there as well as a lot of unique, almost Beatles like stuff. It has high energy. I will check out how Amadou and Mariam sound with a different producer as well."
5,Love this CD,"This is a GREAT CD, the music is wonderful, inventive, different and amazingly engaging. I've had it on repeat play for days. Mariam's voice and the guitar work is outstanding. I recommend it. If you love West African music, you'll love this. If you want to try West African music, Dimanche a Bamako is a great start."
5,If you think of salsa as...............,"If you think of salsa as ballroom set to Latin music, this DVD is not for you. If you have taken ballroom salsa classes, you will be lost.If, however, you dance in salsa clubs or want to dance in salsa clubs with real salseros this DVD is a great complement to your instruction. The basics and simple turn patterns are covered.I think some of the reviews are funny. The instructor gave a move a Spanish name and she threw some of you a curve. A cross body is a cross body lead regardless of the name.I highly recommend this DVD."
3,Plenty of saxophone,"This is a live album made in Bloomington, Indiana, home of Indiana University. It's a trio album, so it's basically A LOT of Branford. Branford is of course a very good saxophonist. However, it's 77 minutes of saxophone playing, mostly soloing, with some melody. The songs are mid-tempo or slow. For me, it starts to all run together. Someone with higher powers of concentration might have a different response."
3,McBain and Aztec Theatre,"This world of springfield enviorment playset looks pretty cool! I don't have this playset, but by just looking at it, I can tell it's proably fun! If you are a die-hard simpsons fan, then add this playset to your simpsons collection (if you HAVE a simpsons collection)."
4,Awesome screw covers...look fantastic,These are awesome screw covers and look fantastic with my chrome licence plate frame.Gave it 4 stars because they are made of plastic...stainless steel would have been just splendid.Can't say how long it will be until the chrome wears away.
2,Fail,Didn't fit my screws and are too bulky to be used with the three different frames I've tried them on. Maybe a more specific description would help others choose a different option. If you have a raised frame and your screws are even slightly recessed these most likely wont fit.
4,Good Products,"I thought the products were great. I love the car charger, it takes no time at all to charge my phone."
3,Samsung Cell Phone kit,It took longer to get here then I thought it would and the person I call hears a buzzing noise when I use the ear piece. The case is a little small. The charges seems to be fine.
4,Unique Songs,This is a great CD for anyone looking for unique songs for their wedding reception or anniversary celebration. We used two songs from this CD during our 25th anniversary vow renewal ceremony and received several compliments on them.
2,"Not Good, Not Bad","I'm pleased with the appearance of these on my nouveau plate cover, but they feel incredibly cheap and I don't expect them to stay on while driving down the road. I understand you need to be able to take them back off, but I feel like they're going to fall off on their own!We'll see how it turns out."
5,Gardening by Heart,"McGreevy's book is warm, witty and thought-provoking. The author encourages readers to slow down and truly appreciate and celebrate the simple joys of all the gardens we encounter in life. She effectively uses simple gardening lessons to communicate even more important lessons for living a fuller and happer life. The book inspired me to follow my heart in creating gardens to experience and enjoy with all of my senses. I look forward to sharing this special book with all of my gardening friends."
4,truly PHAT rap,"This is one of the truly great rap CDs made. Funkdoobiest mixes sweet loops from the fifties hit Tutti-Frutti and a toilet flushing, which shows thier versatility. Personal favorite tracks include Bow-wow-wow and Whopbabalubop. If you're looking for an older CD to have, this is the one from the days when rap was fun. Their sound is much like Cypress Hill's (of which B-real makes an appearance) but takes it to a different level."
3,It's a decent old school rap CD,"Maybe old school isn't the right choice of words but Ninety's flava fo sho! I do like it and if you're into the Cypress Hill groove, you may give it a four or a five. It met my expectations though. I still like Big Daddy Kane better, from that era."
1,Nothing Happend,"No changes noticeable, my sister's hair didn't grow more than what it would without using this product, neither the length or structure of the hair changed,after following the treatment properly, consistent of pills, step one & tow, the shampoo and conditioner.Note. I rated one star because the 0 option is not available."
3,Looks Fantastic-cooks Good,"I replaced my 6 year old Sharp with this oven. It has performed well for the past 5 months.The sensor cook feature is nice,we shall see how it will hold up. Almost all small kitchen appliances are now made in China as is this model Panasonic is no exception. I have noticed a wide difference in quality from Chinese made items,some are good and others miss the mark. Buy from an Importer that will stand behind their product!"
5,Touches the soul,"Schwartz-Bart takes you on a journey in the eyes of Ernie Levy, a young boy who follows in a long line of Just Men. He represents the suffering of all Jews and at a young age must take on the responsibility of his entire race. One feels the pain of the Jews as they are persecuted and harassed from the earliest days of antisemitism to the final horror of the holocaust. Although a legend, the history of these Just Men is elegantly portrayed, yet painfully real. This reader gained a new perspective on what it truly means to be persecuted because of ones religion/race. A great read"
5,Good memories!!!,Excellent video!!!!! The way that they use for rea;ization was amazing and all music and production under the king of music production.
5,Fantastic Minimalism,"Fluxion shows the way. With Deeeep Bass and minimal beats and clicks he manage to make minimal techno just as it should be.If you are into ""Basic Channels"" ""Metalbox"" and Maurizio's ""Maurizio"" album this CD is made for you.It's hard to explain why this CD is so good... The style is raw, heavy and very repetetive. When I first heard it, I just thought Fluxion had stolen Basic Channels sound and just changed it a little without doing anything new. But that's wrong! After have heard this CD for one month I can't live without it. This is heavy stuff, actually the most serious heavy minimal tech I've heard for years. It has everything a minimal techno CD should have. No wonder when it's from the Chain Reaction label.The angry naughty bass that pumps through the whole album, the wonderful dub-delays and chords.. The submarine-""pings"", The minimal hi-hat... The naughty industry/machine-sounds, All together mixed in a wonderful minimal-tech cocktail. It's so beatiful.. Enjoy!"
5,Should not be overlooked,"I bought this CD after hearing a Christmas track played over the radio. It is absolutely fabulous. Winter nights includes some seasonal tracks as well as eclectic choices - the arrangements are wonderful. Check out his version of the beautiful Peter Gabriel ballad ""Mercy Street "". Done as an instrumental in Dimeolas style it fits perfectly with the winter theme of this CD. Don't just save it for the holidays - select the great non seasonal tracks for any gathering."
3,CORRECT TRACK LISTING - ROZALLA 'EVERYBODY'S FREE' CD SINGLE,"US CD Maxi Single Track Listing for -""EVERYBODY'S FREE (TO FEEL GOOD)"" - ROZALLA1) 3MI 7"" Remix Edit - 3:332) Orginal Mix - 6:213) Free Bemba Mix - 6:044) Rave Mix - 4:535) 3MI Remix - 7:336) SCO Tweak Mix - 5:$31992"
5,Schwinn 430 Elliptical Trainer,"I am please to say this is a well built machine. It is great for cardio, and it working me very well. Was easy to put together with no problems at all.The one thing it lacks is the heart rate monitor is very slow to slow your heart rate. That area could be improved.Overall experience is very Happy with this machine, would recommend to anyone out there looking to do cardio."
4,Very nice,"Took a couple hours to put it together, it doesn't squeek, and provided hours of a good workout so far. The only complaint is that some of the parts ocassionally come loose but I just tighten and move on."
3,Not bad,"This elliptical definately is not the best however, for non-commercial/home use it's not bad.Our elliptical was delivered in a timely manner with all of the packaging intact. I put the elliptical together on my own in about 2 hours (with little people interruptions). I'm sure that without them I could have completed the task quicker.After putting the elliptical together it ran well. Not one sound and very smooth. It has been a few weeks of daily use and now there is a slight knocking noise. It is a problem, maybe but the elliptical still runs very smoothly.Though this elliptical cannot compare to the ranks of Sole or higher priced/quality models. I would call this purchase a ""good buy."" Just make sure to take advantage of the warranty before it expires"
1,Don't bother buying Schwinn Junk,"I had a Schwinn 438 elliptical for a few years and used it very little. Probably less than 100 mi. registered on the console. Today, as my grandson was on it, the welds holding the mast broke and the mast came forward knocking him off the machine. We were very lucky that he wasn't injured. I contacted Schwinn and was told that they would not warranty this part and that I'd be required to buy a new mast. If you do a search on this model you'll see that this is not an isolated incident. The welds were insufficient and failed from metal fatigue I'll reweld the mast myself (properly) and will never, ever buy another Schwinn product."
2,great elliptical until it fails,Bought this elliptical in May 09...worked great till Sept 09. After which it started squeaking horribly. It produces very large squeaking noise while working out....you can't keep working out with that loud of a noise....called the customer service they asked me to put white lithium grease....which I did but didn't fix the problem. Really loved the elliptical while it worked and it also helped me lose weight but after I started having this loud squeaky noise coming out of it...haven't been able to use it since. Therefore I am only giving it a 2 star....
1,Double Whammy,"Received the elliptical in mid April. Assembly was easy, only took a couple of hours. That is when the troubles began- the dreaded error message appeared but I received a new console. A new problem surfaced immediately-a defective motor. Customer service was very pleasant and that new motor was at my house lickety split, but evidently no technician could be found to service this machine and so it sits,noisy and useless. The last communication with the service department resulted in a promise to get back to me ASAP regarding a new machine. That was right before Memorial Day. Based on the length of time that it has taken attempting to get my elliptical working, I would strongly suggest another company/elliptical. Those are hours that I am never getting back again.Update: Have been confirmed to receive a replacement elliptical, the 431. 430 was not available. Will this be the end of this saga?"
4,"For its price, you can't do much better","When this arrived at my doorstep, it looked like it would be a pretty daunting task to assemble. It really wasn't that bad. It took about two hours mainly because I screwed up and put two regular washers on the bolts instead of one washer and one locking washer. That was my bad and I had to go back and re-do some areas. Other than that it was pretty straightforward. We've been using it now for two weeks with no squeaking or anything. Just smooth quiet operation like most of the other reviewers have said.Overall, this is a great product. For the price you pay, you get a lot of features without all of the quirky things that you don't really need.My only gripe is that the stride could be longer. I'm 6'4"" and I have long legs so often my heel will come off the foot hold at the back of the stride. Not a big deal, but the only thing I've noticed that I would change."
5,Gets a Workout - Top Notch!,"After two solid years of nearly daily use we have zero complaints. Now our 13 yo even uses it so it sees roughly 10 hours a week of use. We all have our favorite programs and it has enough to satisfy the pickets user. My wife and I are both runners but I suffer from terrible shin splints from too many miles with ruck sacks... I knew what I wanted, but $2k was nuts for a gym quality elliptical. We took a gamble on the Schwinn and it paid off!It does take a bit of skill to put together and you have to understand what needs proper lubrication in order to remain totally silent. A $5 can of PTFE or other dry lubricant and you are set for a decade of use. I generally spray the moving parts about once a month and after well over 1000 hours of use it is as good as new.If you dont need a bunch of worthless doodads (ipod docks, tv's and daily horoscope readers) this one is for you. Quality, simple and built for frequent daily use."
5,Great Machine Even Better Bargain,This elliptical rivals machines twice as expensive. Easy to put together. Easy to operate. Enjoyable workout.
5,A great buy for the price,"After much research, especially reading independent reviews, we decided on the Schwinn 430. It took about one and a half hours to assemble with two of us working together. Directions were fine. This is a very solid and quiet machine. Since it rolls on front wheels, one person can move it around quite easily. Operation is simple to learn from a well-writen owners manual. No regrets here."
3,Review of Schwinn 430 Elliptical Trainer,"Both my wife and I have been using it. Couple of days after use the left hand bar started becoming noisy. I guess its because of the speed that I use. I use from 4.2-6mph. My wife doesn't notice the sound.If I lubricate the joint, it works fine for around 20 min. After that it starts squeeking again. I guess lubrication is the problem. Schwinn should do something about the lubrication of joints."
3,"Works well, once fixed","It came quickly with the free shipping, but once assembled, the computer did not register speed. Called the 1-800 #, and they said they would send some replacement parts and a repair person (speed sensor). The repair person called and told me to replace the computer (which he had sent a couple days later), and that I was too far and he did not want to come all the way out if it was just the computer. Well, it was not the computer, it was the magnetic part on the wheel which feel off so the senor could not register speed. I replaced it after ~ 2 h of disassembling the machine!!!! 25 cent part, but what a pain. Anyway, now it works well. I applied some lithium grease to some joints to remove the squeaking. My wife and I are using it frequently and feel better already. Mostly satisfied, but don't know if I would recommend someone else to purchase the same machine."
4,Recommended,Arrived early. I had to give some money to the delivery man to help me bring it to the house (3rd floor). Assembly was not so bad (2.5 hours).After some weeks of normal use it started to squeak a little. I have it about 6 months now (bye bye labor warranty) and the noise is getting loud. Otherwise is a steady and convenient machine.
5,The Schwinn 430 is an excellent buy.,"I've owned my 430 for fifteen months so far and I'm still using it almost every day because it just feels good. And I'm not one for premeditated, self-inflicted exercise. It's silky smooth, very quiet, and built so solidly I suspect it will outlast me. There were no missing or incorrect pieces and two hours is about right for assembly time.I did learn quickly that it performs best if it sits on a heavy pad. I bought one at WalMart for less than $20.00 that works perfectly. I also discovered that the grease Schwinn uses is too heavy and too little had been applied. The pivoting points were stiff and actually became warm to the touch with use. I bought a small tube of lithium based white grease (for bicycles) at the hardware store and regreased the machine. The difference was like night and day. Overall, I am very happy with my choice."
1,Good Faeries Versus Evil Daemons,"It's already been mentioned, but the only thoughtful way to read this book is in conjunction with David M. Jacobs' ""The Threat,"" which interviews abducteees just as credulously and comes to opposite, terrifying conclusions about the motives of Alien visitors. What's really going on here is the War of the Mad Gurus: which seer will sucessfully sell his vision of the unknown among us? Too bad the WWF doesn't have a category for Battlin' UFO Academics."
5,Why does Creative charger cost so much more?,"This pack of chargers work perfectly. I paid over $20 for a Creative AC charger for my Zen Vision: M and I still need to plug in an extra dongle to use it. This set of cables allow me to charge the device without a silly dongle. The Creative dongle defeats the purpose of the plug as you will need to haul it around with the player itself (which is a pain) or shell out even more money to get a second one (on top of the cable's already bloated price). Do yourself a favor and buy these instead. You'll save a lot of money, they work fine, and they are easier to use than the first party cables."
2,2.0 Sync USB Data Cable wouldnt sync,I lost my adapter for my Creatve Zen Vision M and was hoping this would solve my problem. I wanted to upload more songs but wont be able to because it wont sync. Now I have to spend twice because I need to buy the adapter.
5,Works like it should.,"Bought from ClearAV. These cables charge my 30gb Vision-M like they should, fast. The fit and finish is as good as you can get for the money. Definitely get the AV cable too if you can get it in one package. With this package you'll have everything you need without using that creative doggle. I highly recommend these for their value."
1,This product does not work,"I purchased this rock polisher for my son for christmas. He was so excited. I had read other reviews so was expecting this to be noisy and take time. What I was not prepared for was that this product does not work. I used all the premeasured stones, I even decreased the amount of stones and it would work for about 10 minutes then shut off. I got it on sale and would have cost me almost as much to mail it back for the return as I paid for it. Do not waste your money. Buy a more expensive product with proven track record. Terrible disappointment for my 8 year old! Luckily, I had a friend at work that had an old polisher her kids no longer used. The one she gave us worked great."
3,"Quirky, but okay first tumbler","This is my first experience with a rock tumbler. It was a gift for my 7 year old daughter who has a fascination with rocks. She loves it though it does take more patience than the average seven year old has She enjoys checking on the stones, filling it up and setting it to go again.It is loud; we have it set up in garage. We also had a problem with it not spinning at first. It simply rocked back and forth. We lifted the front foot up two inches and that got it going again.All in all, I think it is a great beginner tumbler for the price but she if she shows interest in continuing we will be looking for a nicer one. Perhaps, a quieter one."
3,rock tumbler,This is an extremely effective polisher; there was a noticable difference after the first step. The only issue I have noticed so far is that it is very noisy. I had to wrap it in fabric put it in a box and cover with a blanket to make tolerable. If you have a garage put it in there!
4,Riders in the Sky - Harmony Ranch,"We first got the Harmony Ranch abum years ago on Audio Tape when we heard the Riders in the Sky at the Puyallup Fair (in Washington State). Our whole family loved it so much we wore out the tape. We were thrilled to replace it with a CD, and got several more Riders in the Sky albums on CD. Such an enjoyable and entertaining group and music. You will never be disappointed. Great family and kid-friendly music and stories."
3,Still Under Review - Review Updated 05/19/07,"This is an initial review. I will come back later & re-review. I received this with a large 1/4"" scratch on the crystal. You have to be careful with the yellow background becuase it tends to hide flaws (thats good in the long term, but not when you just received it new)Not yet sure about the watch. I have returned it & am waiting for a new one.. Upon first impressions the watch looked real nice and hopefully my next review will tie up any loose ends. Just as an FYI, Amazon is always easy to deal with when returning something. The few returns I have done have beeen flawless.05/19/07 After receiving a new replacement I am very satisfied with this watch now. It has been keeping very good time and seems to stay easily in sync with my best watches. Impressive time keeping and for $29.95 is a very good purchase. I would buy this again."
1,THE WORST WATCH I HAVE EVER PURCHASED,"THIS WATCH DOES NOT WORK ACCORDING TO THE MANUAL. I HAVE TRYED TO GET IT TO WORK ABOUT 75 TIMES, MY WIFE HAS TRYED ABOUT AT LEAST 25-30 TIMES, AND I TOOK IT TO A JEWLER AND EVEN HE COULD NOT GET IT TO WORK. THIS WATCH IS A PIECE OF JUNK"
3,great watch,"The instructions for setting up the watch are slightly confusing, but once complete the watch keeps accurate time."
4,bright lights,nice contemporary finishing touch to my new kitchen! well made product at a reasonable price.Wish the light bulbs were LED. We installed the lights over an island about 4 feet above.The light bulbs generates quite a bit of heat so it gets pretty hot dining right below the lights.Super super bright though. We also installed recessed lights but could've been okay just lsland lighting alone.
3,"Nice, Easy Read, But...","I have many Agatha Christie mysteries in paperback but wanted a hardcover, which this book is. However, the Seller from whom I bought the book didn't describe it correctly. It is described as a ""blue leatherette edition."" It's not. I received a black book. I emailed the Seller to ask why. His response was: ""Bantam describes the color officially as 'sussex blue'. Many people think it is black. I try hard not to disagree with anyone over it so I use the publisher's description of the color."" Unfortunately, he did NOT use the publisher's complete description, as the word ""sussex"" does not precede the word ""blue"". Frankly, I was disappointed when I received it and told the Seller so, but he never offered to make any kind of restitution. Also, this book was published by Bantam Doubleday, so I have to wonder if it's a book club edition. Not too happy about that. I'm keeping the book but will not do business with this Seller again."
2,Yawn!,"I've read most of Finder's novels and enjoyed the majority of them. I got this title in audiobook form - unfortunately it's an abridgement and a bad one to boot. There are sudden radical changes of venues that catch the listener off guard and can at times make it confusing to follow the plot. The plot itself, dealing with corruption within the CIA, rogue ex-intelligentia, the entire stolen Russian gold reserve and mind-reading induced by a powerful MRI is, as opposed to other works by Finder, is completely implausible. The narrator was lack-luster in his breathing,sense of punctuation and voice characterizations making it even harder to stay with this mediocre work. I'd skip this one."
3,"Not His Best, Should Stick to Pure Thrillers","I guess the best I can say about this book is that I was luck enough to listen to the abridged version of tape. From what I could tell from the taped version, the full length book must have been tedious at best. As to the sci-fi part of the book, it was so 'hokie' as to be worthless as a 'hook'. That the book 'turned' on this 'hook' does not speak well for Finder, who usually writes much better than this.Spies, double agents, secret letters, secret files, swiss bank accounts, etc. You've read it all before, and done better. Good for an airplane ride or a boring long drive on the interstate."
5,"Singen keine melodien.... Singen Ein, Zwei, Drei, Für!","What can you say? It's so simple, at least the lyrics, but also so perfect! I don't know how many times I have listened to it and it doesn't matter 'cos you never get sick of it. You know how it is when you have listened to a song you really like too many times, you stop hearing it, it's just there, it doesn't affect you in the same way anymore. But not this one, it has this sound to it that makes it always sound new, something that grabs you. At least it is for me, and should be for you if you like up-tempo electronic music and people shouting in german."
2,A badly digressive manual,"This book was more trouble than it was worth. It is poorly organized, the pictures are b/w and unclear. Most problematic is the writing style. Cunningham never gives simple instructions, but prefers to digress on the various ways you might do the task, and the type of jig he made. Very frustrating.I ended up printing instructions from Instructables dot com and found that they were much more user-friendly."
4,"The big, big book of children's songs","Strogly recommended for the beginning guitarist, elementary school teacher, camp counselor who want to include music in a group setting. For the aspiring guitarist, the text includes diagrams of the nine strum or pick patterns that can be used with the songs. Each title in the book has a suggested pick/strum pattern. Other easy guitar books sometimes include this feature. I found these patterns to be very helpful as a self-teching method. The songs are well known popular children's songs that are familiar to everyone and can be used in any recreational/ educational seting with children. I liked the book in so far as it helpled me practice guitar skills that I am acquiring (the chords are basic to easy guitar) and provided me material to use in my work setting."
2,THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE NOT SIMPLE,"The idea is a good one: A BIG BOOK OF CHILDREN'S SONGS. There are many classic kid's song and this is probably a good book if one just needs the lyrics but the arrangements are not simple or easy to play. I have taught guitar for many years and I can tell you that the publishers have made these songs much more complicated than they actually are. For example, the Beatle's tune, YELLOW SUBMARINE is a simple 3-chord song in the key of G but here they've added 3 extra chords not in the original tune. Another complaint is the authors have transposed many of these song in the key of ""F"" which unfortunately is one of the hardest chords to play for beginning guitarists especially people with little hands. If you want simple arrangements and easy-to-play kid's tunes - look elsewhere."
4,children's songs,"If you're looking for a collection of classic children's songs, this is the book for you..."
3,Uh yeah.,"I bought this for my little bro and I sat down to watch it with him. Now just to tell you, i'm not so keen on digimon. Anyway the first episode is of this devil vs. an angel. Then you see this kid named Tai who has a pet dragon or something and he fights this other creature. He almost dies too. There is also this girl named Sora who gets into some deep sleep or something so two of her friends named Joe and Matt go to save her. Joe has to grab here shoulders and rub them to wake here up. Matt then helps her up. Overall it's really weird but my bro loved it so I give it 3 stars!"
4,"Great collection, slightly different mixes on some songs","This is a great collection of songs. However, if you compare some of the songs here to those on domestic cds you will note a little different mix: mainly the orchestra brought out front more and the voice moved back. On some of the cuts I find this a little annoying."
5,THIS BOOK CHANGED MY LIFE,"brilliantly argued, beautifully written, this book changed my life and the way i see the world. i never realized the relentless, often unobservable invasions of privacy all around me. rosen documents these incursions and offers meaningful, realistic solutions. above all, this is a book filled with humanity, humor, and insight. i feel the better for reading it. Thank you professor rosen."
5,Rhodiola Revolution,"I received this book in record good time, and in almost new condition even though it is a used book. I am well satisfied with the product and the shipping. I have not as yet had opportunity to review the book because I just moved to my new residence and am still almost exclusively occupied with unpacking boxes!"
5,the Best,"I love applique and these are so great, but I also love to do woodburning and these patterns are great for that too. I especially like the cover girl and have put her on a pillow and will make more pillows as gifts with these patterns. I really like the faces covered with the bonnets."
3,Latch failed within a month,"I had a previous version of this model from Panasonic. It lasted for 10 years, I was surpirsed when this updated version failed within a month. The latch would not close the door and, as a consequence it would not run. I took it to a authorized dealer today. He was suprised by the way it failed. I suppose even under very good quality control such failures could occur.In every other way it worked as expected."
5,Super product with lots of features,Many useful features with a control panel that is easy to figure out - most intuitive. The typical sale price makes this large unit a bargain.
2,Nice Microwave Oven But Has Poor Reliability,"I've had it for approximately 3 years. Nice overall value - price, performance, etc ... when I first purchased it.But it broke down after 2.5 years (warranty 1 year) of use. My other microwave ovens before lasted virtually forever (10+ years). When I called one of the Panasonic authorized repair centers, the guy looked up my serial number and told me that the high voltage inverter needs to be replaced. Apparently, they are aware that the inverter has poor reliability and high failure rate. The guy said ""Panasonic would pay for the part but not the labor.""I think if a company knows its product is marginal, they should stand behind it by offering to pay for both defective parts and labor.So far, I haven't repaired the unit. I am in the market to buy a new unit but most likely not a Panasonic microwave oven again."
3,Panasonic Microwave,"The first one I got died after the second time I heated a cup of coffee; I had received it just several days before. You replaced it with a new unit. So far, so good. However, I liked my old Panasonic Genius much better and it lasted almost 25 years with one minor repair in all that time."
1,Poor life expectancy,Purchased 9/30/08. Failed 9/30/08. Repaired under warranty. Failed again 6/3/10. Lasted less than two years! This complaint seems to apply to a wide range microwave brands. It was a nice microwave when it worked. Our previous microwave lasted over 15 years. I would rather pay more for something that lasts. This will only end up in a landfill somewhere. What a waste!
1,"Great oven, but play close attention to shipping charges",One company sells this oven for $90 and adds $85 for shipping!!! What a deal! Caveat emptor....buyer beware.
4,Great Microwave,This unit is great and the only reason it did not rate a five star is because I don't like the push button door opener. I would like to be able to pull on a handle to open the door. I read allot of reviews before I chose this unit. One review said that their unit was noisey but ours is not. The plate of food option works great for me. It is the first microwave I owned that actually heated the whole plate of food evenly. It has an unbelievable amount of space inside. I am very happy with it.
3,Not for larger wheels,"Product seems of good quality but they are too short for larger wheels. I was in such a hurry to get a replacement and finish mowing before the rain started that I didn't notice these ""Universal"" bolts were about a 1/2 inch too short for the hub on my 14"" rear wheel. Measure your bolt before you order to make sure they will work."
3,Great For Teens Who Love Suspense,"This is a very entertaining book that will hold your interest the whole way through. If you are a teenager who enjoys horror and suspense novels along the lines of Lois Duncan books, then you will enjoy this book. It takes place in a high school and has a theme that most teens can relate to; gossip. It shows, albeit in an extreme, almost unrealistic light, what can happen when rumors get out of hand."
3,Not as pictured,"Although the dish is very pretty, I purchased it to use with other dishes. The bowl has a distressed finish that I wasn't expecting so I returned it."
2,product,there were no instructions on how to put these on. I have set them on they fall off. I tried to snap on and even glue on but the glue ruined two rail cars.
4,Just what a busy woman needs to make her own soap!,"I found this book to be exactly what I wanted. I'm a working wife who dabbles in many crafts and hobbies. I wanted to try my hand at crafting a few bars of soap without all the fuss needed for lye soaps. I grated castille soap to make mine and I was very pleased with the results. I made the Pet Soap and it works well on my Westie. I disagree with other reviews below. I purposely bought this book because it tells you up front that it is not a ""from scratch"" recipe book. I was not mislead into thinking I was making true (from lye) soap. The pictures were well done and the instructions are clear. I found most ingredients available in a local store dealing in all natural products. I still purchase handmade soaps from true soapmakers...but it's also fun to make these soaps for my family and friends."
5,Awesome Comedian!!,"We listened to Kristin on XM radio on the way up to our cabin and the 4 of us were laughing so hard we were crying, had to buy the CD, she Rocks!!"
5,'Til Their Eyes Shine,I purchased this tape when my daughter was born six years ago. We still listen to it daily. The songs are personal and have become my songs to both of my children. Highly recommended for every child's music collection. Ageless and timeless.
3,The Gangster We Are All Looking For,"I find reading and learning about other cultures very fascinating. As someone born and raised in the US, I am ignorant to the strife and struggles some other cultures must endure to survive. I recommend reading this type of book for that reason.The book is written from the perspective of a child and goes in and out of fantasy. For me, I found it difficult to keep track of characters and plot."
2,Rakim - What Happend?,"I dont need to say much about this album... only buy this if you're a big fan of Rakim, like myself.. Freddie Fox said it best ""I Bought The Master, That Album Was A Total Hiphop-Disaster!"" im just telling you like it is.. this album is very dispointning.. check his older records with Eric B.. much more dope old school rap!"
3,pretty good but not as good as could be,Rakim is still the king of the mic no doubt about that point.but the beats and the music weigh down the genius.with that outlook this makes the disc pretty-good but not good.it's missing hooks.MC's are still playing catch up to his flow and he deserves better material.
2,Disappointed,"As a seasoned bread baker, I am disappointed that a 640-page bread cookbook contains only two whole grain recipes. She could have at least included a section on whole-grain, but one has the impression that Beranbaum doesn't like the taste of whole-grain. Her methods are good, but, considering that part of the reason to make a sponge is to soften the whole-wheat flour, it surprised me that her sponge-based recipes do not contain any. This is a good cookbook if you want to learn the sponge method of bread baking, but as a source for a variety of bread recipes, I wish I had purchased a different one."
4,Bread bible is right,"In my opinion you dont really need another other book on baking bread then this one. I first checked it out at the library then ended up rechecking it out a few times after. Spouse said' Um its time to buy it."" So I did. Awesome book on all things bread!"
3,Too much for me,"I mistakenly bought this book when I was wanting to buy ""The Bread Baker's Bible"" I had seen at a friend's house. I have been a bread baker for more than 30 years but, while I love to bake and cook and do not shy away from complicated recipes, I do not care to invest the time and effort into bread making this book calls for. The editor's review is very accurate and had I known what I was really purchasing when I ordered this book and had read that review, I would not have gotten it. I think I'll put it on the shelf until all my kids are grown and I have more time to work at these recipes."
4,Best explaination of technique,"So far the recipes I've tried have been terrific. While you have to read carefully on when and where to add some of the ingredients, if you are careful, you get wonderful breads. And yes, you can move the bread up one level in the oven, and put your cast iron skillet the one below it and everything will come out just fine."
4,LOVE the Capacity!,"After owning a 1.1 cubic foot microwave for 8 years, this was DEFINITELY a step (or three!) up in size. The capacity is absolutely amazing and if the microwave weren't quite so loud, I would have given this 5 stars.I love that it beeps when it's finished cooking and even displays a ""enjoy your meal"" note :)"
2,"Good oven, 'till cheap Inverter died","My Panasonic NN-H965 unit was mfd Nov 2008, purchased Aug 2009, died Nov 2010, 3 months after parts warranty expired. Cause of death: Inverter failure. My appliance tech advised me that the inverter unit used was not very robust. Estimated repair cost: Inverter component, at least $100, plus labor charge. Going back to using a 14 year old Sharp oven I held onto after replacing a bad capacitor last year (when we bought this model). Magnetron tube for this unit has 5-year warranty, but that's not what failed for me. Unit was easy to use and worked well, until it quit. Consider dreaded extended warranty, or a different oven."
2,Too Much Plastic -- Door Broke Less Than 2 Yrs!,"It was nice to have a big microwave for our large family, but the door broke in less than two years. I've seen video and complaints on the internet about this problem. The door latch is made of plastic and the latch catchers are also made of plastic. After awhile they just wouldn't catch properly and the microwave wouldn't turn on. Some things should be metal and made to handle thousands of door closings. This unit wasn't made to last."
2,No sensor cooking for rice but one for omelets,"The title says it all. How often will you make an omelet in your microwave? How often will you use a microwave rice steamer especially if you have an Asian household? Otherwise microwave works fine for what we have used it for.When I called Panasonic to ask about this the ""customer service"" person read out of the instruction manual that came with the unit. I can read a manual. I do not need to wait on hold for 15 minutes to have it read for me."
5,Awesome Microwave,"This is a very nice unit. It is very easy to use and easy to program. Nice one touch buttons for reheating, popcorn, ect."
3,Glaze isn't great,The glaze is a bit muddy so the details aren't as clear as my other fiestaware mugs. You always have to take a chance.
5,Fabulous adolescent saga of a disabled Stone Age boy.,"A disabled boy growing up in a Stone Age clan of Hunters who are nomadic. The clan leaves the protagonist in a cave to die because he slows the clan down in their search for bison. He does not die however in the snowy winter. He survives by killing a saber toothed tiger and by learning that he has strength and worth beyond his disability. When the clan returns in the spring they are in awe of their disabled clan member and his pelt of the ""man-killer&quot"
5,It worked!,"My 8 year old son is such a hard sleeper that I was skeptical about an alarm that would wake him and train him to be dry at night. But after 8 years of being wet every night, he was desperate to try it. The first week I thought I had wasted my money. I had to drag him out of bed soaking wet 3 times every night. The alarm didn't wake him, and he resisted getting up every time. I was sleep deprived and tired of changing the sheets over and over, and I was sooooo tired of pee! But by the end f the second week he was waking up on his own and only once a night. After 5 weeks he was completely dry and has been alarm and pee free for 3 weeks. This is an amazing product. Don't get frustrated. Give it time. You will be so glad you did!"
3,Alarm tone unnecesarily unpleasant,"I bought this alarm for my eight year old son who has expressed his wish to learn how not to wet the bed at night. Although we are still early in the process (second week of use), I have an early complaint which is that the tone of the alarm is quite unpleasant. It's a harsh, stressful sound, and I'm afraid it's actually sinking in as a negative reinforcement, not the neutral behaviour imprinting I was hoping for. Maybe worth ""splurging"" for a model with more tone options.Also, the item is quite pricey for what it is...Will come back once we have used it for a longer time and have more elements to assess its effectiveness."
3,Nasal spray from the Dr. worked!,"My son is almost 9. Nothing worked. He destroyed the Malem Ultimate 1 alarm, either that or the wire, because it stopped working...due to the fact that he TORE it out when it went off, but stayed asleep...or went back to sleep without being roused enough to get up to go. WET BED EVERY MORNING. Well, we finally went to the doctor. She said, ""it is very simple."" She prescribed Desmopressin Acetate Nasal Solution 0.01%. We spray 1 puff in each nostril before bed. We also have him not drink any milk after 3pm, and no fluids after around 6pm (dinner). He has been dry every night for 7 nights in a row! He is so happy! So am I :)"
3,Not New,"This wasn't a new CD, there are several tracks on here that are scratch all up, wish I could find a digital copy."
4,classic......,i miss good music......nothing like music from the 80s and 90s other than today's music where its too corny! good beats good and rhymes few things that i like!
4,Works as promised,"There is NO back-up software that is comprehensive and yet VERY simple to use. But this software does a good job of keeping it relatively simple.On the advice of a knowledgeable friend, I purchased this version 9, which is out of date. Buying a later version just means you'll pay more, but get only ""bloatware.""This software does a great job of supporting good back-up practices, and got great reviews from the computer magazines and web sites.I use it to create complete images of my XP drives. When my drive finally fails, I'll be able to pop in a new C drive and in an hour or so be doing exactly what I was doing on the failed drive.Get it and you'll know why."
4,Acronis True Image 9.0,"What I received was a Software To Go copy from Tiger Direct. There was no printed manual, though there is a manual on the CD. It works as advertized, and there is a True Image forum online where help can be found."
3,Acronis True Image Backup 9.0 Review,Tried out to see if any improvement over my Drive Image Ver 7.0 software. When making full Image backups program needs a lot more space possibly another larger drive. Acronis has some good features but is more difficult to use than Drive Image and seems to require more drive space. Since I don't do file backups I went back to using Drive Image.
2,Hit Or Miss,"This piece of software would be really useful if it was more reliable. I find that more often or not it will not restore what I have backed up, and will give unspecific error messages as to why the restoration failed. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't - that's unacceptable when you're depending on this to back up your data."
2,Not 'Metal' by any stretch !,"I had bought this album because one of the reviews had called it 'fast, Celtic, metal'. It does sound a bit Celtic, but is by no means 'fast'! I would have to file this one under 'easy listening'. I am not disapointed I bought this CD, it does fit in w/ Lorrena McKenitt CD's, which I like. All the songs on this CD are slow ! Just want the buyer to beware of this."
3,Gears from the Greeks,This book is a start of information to making my own replica. I think that I need to find a link to Michael Wright's replica of the Antikythera Mechanism too.
4,"Handy, adjustable log rack",The Panacea Adjustable Length Log Rack is perfect for my entry way. I placed a inexpensive rug under it to save the tile floor from any weight marks and loaded it up! Also bought a cedar 2x4 for the base to repel bugs and cut it to fit the space available. Having a big load of wood in the house has been great as this November has been the snowiest on record for my location and I didn't have to go outside at night for more wood! It will be easy to store (not take up much space) when winter ends.
4,Like it.,"Purchased this for a relative so I could supply her with wood for the winter. For the price it was a great deal. Delivered on time, sturdy, went together easily and holds quite a bit of firewood."
5,CD for the ages,Perhaps the finest disc that Blachly/Pomerium have yet produced (and that is REALLY saying something). Simply put: 'to die for.'
3,its good...,I do enjoy this cd...it sounds nothing like what your known papa roach sounds like. But i would also say do not buy this. Lik emany of the other reviews say..the band did not approve of the release of this cd. It is a copy of their first album. If you want the tracks jsut download them...as said by teh band. Entertaining to listen to...very energetic...and different...but dont buy it ...not because its bad...because the band doesnt want you tooo.
3,A fair basic guide to striking areas and target selection for self-defense.,"While I do not agree with all that Bruce Tegner promotes in his many books; nevertheless, he should be given credit for introducing the public to many previously little known martial arts. I also do not agree with his philosophy concerning responses to various attacks. However, this book will be of value to anyone who is interested in where and how to strike certain areas of the body for self-defense. It is true that most of the information is basic in nature, but keep in mind that most of Bruce Tegner's books were probably written for the average person rather than the seasoned martial artist. In conclusion, this book is a fair guide to striking areas and target selection for self-defense.Rating: 3 stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Shotokan Karate for self-defense: Practical Combat Karate for the street)."
1,As good as a mid-90's screen saver,This is really dated and is really not something that should be bought these days. It was as good as a bunch of mid-90's screen savers.Very disappointing.
5,Unique Intelligent Pop,"This is Imogen Heap's 2nd or 3rd CD, but with the electronics of Guy Sigsworth make up the group Frou Frou (a french word for the sound that dresses make). This is unique intelligent, almost philosophical POP. Yes, there is such a thing. Some of the songs have clever twists of one or two words which question love & life. This is not ""I Love Baby"" pop, but pop with a rock back beat with words as ""Is this it, Yes. Is it? No!"" Imogen Heap sings in top form with full beautiful feminine emotion. The electronic background never gets in her way & at times several layers of sound are added with great skill. Looking forward to the next CD & I hope they don't go off the edge."
5,Imogen's a genius,"I actually got Imogen Heaps solo album before I got this one and I liked it so much I went back to listen to Frou Frou. It's fantastic work. No second guessed attempts. I love music that has lots going on at once. I have a fairly stout Polk set up and if you care about all the ranges, her music will employ a good system. Great stuff."
4,Frou Frou review,"Frou Frou was a new artist to me that I discovered while listening to pandora, she has a very unique sound and I enjoy this CD very much."
2,No good,"Don't buy this album if you're thinking all of the songs are going to be as good as ""let go,"" because they are not. This CD is just boring. A waste of $13."
4,Intelligent emotional music,"These songs remind me why music can communicate more than words, and why great words can create great music.""Let Go"" - It's tough to know which of our fears can be released or overcome. If we knew, we'd probably live less fearfully. ""Let go"" suggests trying to look at our fears from new perspectives. Sometimes we go crazy for good reasons. Sometimes there is beauty to be discovered in the process of a mental breakdown.""Breathe In"" - The sounds of this music clean my head.""It's Good To Be In Love"" - The song is hopeful It metaphorically picks daisies.""Shh"" - If you want to remember what it was like to be young and lustful, rotate this one.""Hear Me Out"" - Reminds us how we can attach to others more than we understandI do praise the above songs. And I look forward to anything new from Imogen or Frou Frou. The music can make you feel more youthful and emotionally connected - if you are open to that.Please comment, express feedback, or suggest related music."
3,"Well, my girlfriend loves it . . .","But I wasn't all that taken, to be honest - I didn't find that this stands up against Goldfrapp, or even Venus Hum, to be absolutely frank. But if you are in the mood, there are worse things that you could put on your turntable.Only thing is, one blast of the truly majestic 'Hummingbirds' (by the aforementioned Venus H), will blow Frou Frou into the ionosphere . . ."
5,Good from top to bottom,This is one of those rare albums that is good from beginning to end. All of the songs are lyrical and beautifully written and sung. I found this album by accident and I am so glad that I did. It's such a great piece and is not to be missed if you are looking for something out of the mainstream pop music that dominates the airwaves.
4,It's good...,"Have used this fuel filter in our family ski boat since 1989. Not the easiest to install, but that's because of the way the housing is mounted. All in all, it's a good filter and works well."
2,Doesn't stick so great.,"I used the provided double-sided tape to stick the protector to the wall, around my dartboard. However, after about a day I noticed it was sagging, and when I went to try to realign it, I noticed it just wasn't sticking to the tape. I've tried several times to keep it stuck, but it really just won't. Don't know why. I'll have to use some long nails or something at the corners to pin it to the wall and keep it in place... of course avoiding more holes in my wall was the point of this thing. Can't say I recommend this product."
3,Could easily be improved,"The price is right, but with the velcro collar that is provided, to go around the board, the pieces don't fit snugly. Gravity will cause a gap somewhere in your array. I ended up scrapping the collar provided, and putting my own velcro on the side cheeks, and back of the pieces so that they attach to each other and to the wall."
2,clutch gone in 10 months,"I'm doing work around the house as therapy. It's all light work, screwing into wood only. And the clutch went out in 10 months. I bought this because it was light weight. It certainly won't strain my muscles now! BTW, today I had to use my corded Black and Decker drill I bought in the 70s. I'm not used to tools failing this fast. I gave the Hitachi a second star because I liked it while it lasted."
2,Not for professional Use,If you do any sort of construction at all stay away from this drill. I do aluminum work and this drill is definitely not up to snuff. It overheats and burns out after light screw running and the battery charge doesn't last more than 20 min. It is nice and small though and would be an ok drill for around the house light duty work.
2,DEAD AGAIN,"I expected more from hitachi! Coming from a carperter of 18 years, this tool will not make it in the field with me. I use it in the shop and around the house. I do like the drill itself and the flash-light is great. If you put charge on the battery for your next use, it will be dead less that 2 days in a nice warm shop. I can leave my makita in the truck for weeks in 20 degree weather an it will be ready to go when you need it."
2,Cordless Drills arent' all the same,"I have used Makita and Hitachi in the 14.4V power range. The Makita is by far a better drill, but the Hitachi is lighter and easier to use. The Hitachi is an ok drill for the money, but it doesn't like rough handling. If you drop it, even from short heights you can expect major damage. I have already thrown one drill away due to internal damage from dropping it from my tool belt, but I kept the batteries for the other drills. I also purchased a ""reconditioned"" 14.4V Hitachi from Amazon, but found the drill to be of very poor quality out of the box, the reversing switch didn't fully engage without forcing it. It also wasn't the same drill or the same quality as the ones I purchased ""new"" from Amazon, but they had the same part number. ""Reconditioned"" must mean ""product rejected by quality control at factory"" in Japanese!"
2,Does not replace a DeWalt,Bought this unit to replace my aging 14.4V DeWalt. Unfortunately it can not replace the DeWalt in power and RPM's. Although as a power screwdriver and light drill around the house for wood only jobs it might do the trick. Would I buy it again - No
2,Too Fragile to be practical,"I really liked this drill, it was light and cheap and the flashlight that it came with was surprisingly handy.Unfortunately, I dropped this drill a few months ago - about four feet - and the skirt the battery clicks into on the handle snapped off. A postmortem inspection reveals that the place the plastic broke was thinner than a dime in many places along the fracture cross-section.Add to that the drill's tendency to overheat and spew acrid fumes and it has little over other cheap brands like black and decker. These are just too fragile."
4,Dello Joio; the almost perfect,"I thoroughly enjoyed this cd. Even though there were some ""not classical"" places, the songs were superb. All I have to say is to quiet it down a tad bit and ship it to me faster. I rate this 4 out of 5."
2,Descriptive & poetic but boring and not kid friendly,"I'm going to have to agree with the person who said they don't understand why this book got a Newberry award. I get that it's poetic. Every sentence is loaded with poetic adjectives, but as far as the story goes I'm not really following it. Half the book is in italics, and it's Dullsville. I don't think kids would enjoy this book. It's more of a Kidlit book for adults."
1,NONONONO I HATE IT,"If I could, I would rate this book zero stars. WHY DID IT WIN AN AWARD? That's a mystery. I hated it. It had no real plot. I was FORCED to read it for school this year in sixth grade. I never finished it. I stopped halfway through. It's really boring. Everybody in my class hated it and I DO NOT RECOMMED!!!!!! I have no clue what kind of NORMAL eleven year old would waste their time reading it. If you ACTUALLY got through this entire book YOU NEED TO GET A LIFE!!!!!!!"
5,Bittersweet Book,"Pictures of Hollis Woods is a bittersweet story that makes you take life for granted and recongize the mistkes you've made.Hollis is a feisty foster child but underneath has a sweet spot.I loved this book,and it is probably one of my favorites."
3,Pictures of Hollis Woods,Hollis is a girl whose mom and dad didn't want. She has pretty much been abondoned all her life. She still doesn't have a family to stay and live with. She still doesn't have a family because every time she goes some where she likes she they always move her. She ends up staying with a girl named Josie but Josie dies of a disease. Then durung the book Hollis lives with the Reagans and if you want to know the rest read the book.
4,Hollis Woods,I thought Pictures of Hollis Woods was an amazing book! It really tells how important family is. Adults and children of all ages would love this book!
1,How to create handcolor images?,"I'm usually very ""kind"" in my reviews, but when I received this book, I really felt like I had been ""taken"". This book, although it has a lot of ""pretty pictures"", has little, if any information on handcoloring photographs. If your objective is to learn this art, look elsewhere. I'm returning this book and buying the other book in this section."
5,great book on handcoloring,This is a great book on handcoloring. THe author gives good explanations of the process of handcoloring using mostly oils. He tells you what works for him and shows many photos of his work that will inspire you to want to creat your own. Also included are the works of many other artists for one to enjoy the many different ways that people approach handcoloring. Very useful tips that i didnt find in other books and was glad to know. I think once one has the information the next step is to just try it and develop your own style.
4,"Very good price, great info","I was very surprised to find this book! I was worried it would be a hard one to find. Not only was it extremely cheap, but I also benefited a group that helps people in Africa and Asia that are in need of vital items. I would probably try to always purchase from this company or one like it to help out. The book itself was very, very cheap (under a 1$) and it wasn't in that bad of condition. No ripped pages, It was a paper back, so there was a little wear and tear on the edges ( but they had this listed as so)."
1,No Show,"I didn't get it. The item never showed up. I ordered it for my son, who waited for it- and was disappointed."
5,Absolutely Fantastic,"What can I say more? This CD has a lot more ""power"" than their second Album (""The Score""), and the the music is a lot more funky... I like especially ""Vocab"" and ""Nappy Heads"". The Remix Version of Nappy Heads is not shown on this Amazon page, but its also great. (Remix Version is Track 18)"
3,Not the pans I was looking for,"The pans I received were not the ones pictured. They were similar, but I really did want the ones with the slotted teflon-free rims and based my purchasing decision on that feature in the image."
1,Don't Be Fooled: These Aren't The Original Recordings,"This is the sort of album of ""remakes"" that drives purists like me nuts. Pat, whom I used to attend church with--he was an amazing songleader--had a string of memorable hits. I remember, during the fifties and sixties, the quaint competition of one being either a Pat Boone fan or an Elvis fan: you couldn't really be a fan of both and be ""real"". (Much like the later forced choice between The Beatles and The Rolling Stones.) And, I'm sure that the sound quality on some of the old recordings made Pat want to redo these songs. However, if you're a purist, look elsewhere for the ""Best of Pat Boone""."
4,Longevity,"Ellis produced a program for National Public Radio for which she interviewed people who were a hundred years old or older. She interviewed a wide variety including Margaret Rawson (a world-renowned expert on dyslexia), Ruth Ellis (the oldest living lesbian), Sadie and Gilbert Hill (married for over eighty years). At first, Ellis is focussed on the historical aspects of their lives, but soon finds herself on a personal journey of her own, where she connects to them as individuals alive in the world and begins to see how looking forward, not backward, is a secret to longevity, as is living in the here and now. More of a story of Ellis herself than the centenarians she met, ""If I Live to Be 100"" is a surprisingly luminous memoir that charms the reader and opens the mind to what it means to be really alive."
1,Pomp and Circumstance,"A well written documentary, but very long on fluff and sentimentality and short in substance."
5,Additional Tips,"We did not pin the alarm to her PJs since it felt heavy, but we pinned it to a little pillow that she could move with her. We also place the wet sensor as instructed on her underwear, but for my ease, I slipped pull ups on top of that so clean up was easier--no wet blankets, just one set of wet underwear."
4,Riffs can go Heavier than this?,"Thats what i often find asking myself when i listen ""Creep Diets"" and when listen ""The Complicated Futility of Ignorance"" but specially ""creep diets"" this is one of the heaviest album i own in my Metal extense collection.Musician, singer, ingeneer producer and Max Cavalera s soninlaw and co founder of Nailbomb project, Alex Newport developed with his awesome Brittish band Fudge Tunnel a sound that originated the agressive new tendences in heavy music all new genres from Death to Nu metal cant deny Fudge Tunnel as one of these 90s bands responsible for the heavy souns of this new millenium.HM"
3,Where's the movie?,"I first read this book in 1980 and loved it. The seamanship is excellent and the story draws you along like a spy thriller.I later came across a paperback version that had a blurb on the cover saying ""Soon to be a major motion picture"" I'm betting Exon or Saudi Arabia owns the movie rights, but it would have been better than ""Titanic"" if they had ever released it. I buy every copy I come across and give them to friends. No one has been disappointed!"
5,the ship killer,"I have been sailing for years and found this hoaky sounding book in a desperate, lack of things to read moment. I have now read it three times and I always loan it out and never get it back. Best adventure story I've ever read. A short time ago I bought a kindle and the first book I tried to download, as you might imagine, was The Ship Killer. I couldn't believe it wasn't available. I've been afraid to read any of the other Justin Scott books because after The Ship Killer they would have to be anticlimactic."
5,The past is back,"This dust mop head is just like the one my mother had in the 1960's. I grew up using that dust mop and with buying a new house with hardwood floors, I needed something that worked. I kept thinking of that old mop head my mom had and low and behold she still had it, after 40+ years. I went on Amazon and found the exact same one from the exact same company!!! Who would have thought they were still being made. It works wonders on our floors, picking up the dog and cat hair like a magnet. I bought the duster spray too and between the two, it works better than any floor swiffer I have seen on the market. If you have wood or laminate floor, I highly recommend getting the Woolux Dry Mop Head!! Shake it up outside, out comes the hair and dust and you're off cleaning again. Love it!"
4,"A personal interpretation, but not a must","Temirkanov's live performance of the Nutcracker Suite on Chandos was so exciting that I rushed to get his complete ballet performance. RCA must have lost faith since this set is out of print, and there's no doubt, with its often slow tempi and moody understatement, that this Nutcracker wouldn't be popular, particularly not with kids.But the recording is warm and natural, and Temirkanov has lots of ideas--this performance is the opposite of the zippy, superficial Gergiev, which rushes by. If you are looking for a highly indiviudla Nutrcracker, played as ""serious"" ballet a la Mravinsky (Temirkanov's predecessor in St. Petersburg), I think you will enjoy this performance, which holds many musial rewards."
5,A Monumental Book,This is an indespensible book for all of those interested in the subtlties of Classical Greek. No other work of scholarship comes close. It is a reminder in these days of cheap cultural criticism what real scholarship looks like.
3,Meh.,Should have listened to the other reviewers. Could have done without this planner...but at least it only cost $5!
3,Good but but not Great,I'm amazed that so many people love this song. It's good but not great. I'd rather listen to uplifting trance tunes any day. However this song is great for the trance industry in Canada. The best remix of this song is the Signum Remix.
5,Best G. Love and SS have to offer,"This is still one of my favorite albums. I thought that G. Love was an aquired taste sort of band, but my girl seemed to like them when we saw G. open up for a very dissapointing Dave Matthews Band. Oh yeah it's that easy."
3,Who couldn't love them?,GREAT CD!! Baby's Got Sauce is my favorite song but the whole CD is great. G. Love & Special Sauce is a band that anyone could love!
2,DISSAPOINTING EFFORT,"NON CREATIVE, TRITE AND CLICHE-RIDDEN ARE THE ONLY WAYS TO DESCRIBE THIS ALBUM. EARLIER WORK IS MUCH MORE CREATIVE. A WASTED EFFORT."
4,Watch review,I purchased this watch as a dress watch. It suits the purpose well. It is a plain but elegant design.
1,Not happy,"I purchased this watch as a birthday present for my husband. When he opened it he noticed that the days of the week were in both Spanish and English, and there doesn't seem to be a way to set it to just one or the other, since there were limited instructions with the watch. By the time he looked at it there was no way for us to return it for a refund. Not happy"
3,Light pleasure,"Sure, compare this fun amusement to Fannie Flag, but comparing this to Faukner IS pushing it. It's a fun beach read, enjoy."
5,"When You're Lustful, When You're Lonely","I'll keep this review plain and simple. Dusk is by far the best CD I heard during the 90's - nothing comes close to that.You may ask how can I arrive at such a definite conclusion, when in fact we are dealing here with an album not too many people have heard of. The answer is simple: Music is all about stirring our emotions. And if we are to measure albums by their stirring capabilities, then we will end up with Dusk on top. It's as simple as that."
2,Seiko watch problems,"Overall the piece is attractive and keeps good time. I have had problems with the date, however. It doesn't keep the accurate date and I have to keep adjusting it."
1,Waste of Money,"A mole hole appeared right next to it after I put it in the ground. The next day we lost 2 more lettuce plants. We would have purchased a dozen more ""Mole Chasers"" if they worked, because we have 5 acres and a lot of moles. As it is, the cat has had better luck in getting rid of them. Score Cat 4--Mole Chaser 0. I can't recommend a product that just doesn't work--the mole area it was supposed to protect is covered with mole tunnels."
2,New Rules,Very disappointed. It was too vulgar. I finished reading it but had to force myself. Not worth the money. I watch Bill on Friday nights and really like those shows most of the time. His political acumen is right on. First New Rules book much better.
3,Truly the Tuscan Milk of Books!,"I was initially skeptical when I saw Herr Maher's book for sale on my Kindle, but I must say that it is a rip-roaring read and the best bit of fun. My hat is off to you, Mr. Maher! I raise a glass to you!"
4,"Short, Funny Takes on America","This is a collection of the ""New Rules"" segments from HBO's Late Night with Bill Maher -- which is both the best and worst part of the book. The best, because Maher's New Rules are short and wickedly funny observations on American life by one of the nation's best satirists. The worst, because if you're a fan of Maher and a regular viewer of his HBO show like me, you've heard most of them before. And did I mention that they were short? The book is a very quick read - so quick it left me wanting more. Bottom line: Buy it, read it, lend it to your friends - it'll make the rounds and be back on your shelf in about a week."
1,Save your money,Save your money on this one. This is a book you will find in the bargin bins for half the price by early next year.
2,Leave This One In the Bathroom,"I don't like Bill Maher. I find him rude, boorish, and generally obnoxious. In this respect, his personality has carried over to this book fairly well. This book is an extended series of Maher's ""polite musings,"" which must be code for bad jokes and general misogyny. Cracks about rape and prostitution are always classy, and, what can I say, Maher is a classy guy....Yeah right.The book is occasionally amusing, in the way a spoiled brat can occasionally inspire a contemptuous chuckle. The sections are all extremely short (the longest is around two pages, and most are much shorter), and the book is padded with cheap B&W; pictures. Leave it in the bathroom when you need something to occupy your mind and you want to amuse yourself at someone else's expense. In this case, at Maher's expense."
1,Really Not Worth It,"I thought the small samples I read were hilarious, then I bought the book...its bad."
1,Please Wake Me When You're Done Billy,"If I could have rated this book lower, I would have. I find it amusing that Mr. Maher considers himself an expert on geopolitics when his own educational background is, to say the least, sketchy. Against my better judgement, I read the book. All I can say is that If I had undergone a pre-frontal lobotomy or had suffered serious brain damage at some time, I might have more appreciation for Mr. Maher and this poor excuse for a book. If you're going to buy it, at least get the hardback because it can always function as a doorstop."
1,"Ugly, Yes; Funny, No","I went into this book with both eyes open -- i.e., fully aware of Bill Maher's free-floating anger and, in particular, of his foam-at-the-mouth loathing of the Catholic Church (his ugliest trait). Despite this preparation, however, I was completely taken aback by the virulence of the rage and hatred that wafts from every page. There's a stench about this book; it stinks of full-blown pathology, and there's nothing remotely funny about that."
1,Dish 1000.2 review,"I bought this product to take with me when my wife and I go camping in our RV. I have the devices to tune into the satellites. I never was able to pickup any programing. I noticed in the instructions there was a Western Arc and a Eastern Arc sateliite. I'm wondering, since this dish came from California that it may not work in the Eastern area. I put it up and broke out my old 500 dish to get a least some programing."
1,Try elsewhere,"Was described as new but several pieces showed markings as if from a previous installation. The most obvious being the triple LNB component. Its plastic housing showed discoloration like you would expect from something having been sun-bleached. None of this would be really bothersome if everything worked. The dish was not able to pick up the 110 or 129 satellites. With the disappoinment of receiving a used and defective setup, I would have liked a full refund but that was not an option. I could only request a replacement LNB by returning the defective one at my own expense. I did not have the time to immediately test the replacement LNB upon receiving it so it has now been several months past. The dish with the replacement LNB now does not pick up any of the three satellites. With two days of attempted installation (a total of 10 hours), a signal could never be gained. Will make more attempts as time allows but I don't have much confidence in obtaining a successful outcome."
1,I'm still nauseous.....,"This has got to be the WORST movie I have ever seen in my life. Total confusion from minute one. This movie is like a bad acid trip. A really long, crawling out of your skin, bad acid trip. Plucking my arm hair out one at a time would have been more pleasant."
1,THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE!!,"Let me start off by saying......I had a migraine after only 15 minutes,this is by far the worst piece of crap i have ever seen.Ill say this the wild wild west is the bomb compared to this film? not sure what it is,if you buy this movie? MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON YOUR SOUL....its realy that bad.PS.Why would any of those stars make a film like this,charity i guess"
1,Shown to Guantanamo Inmates,"This is by far the worst piece of S*** that will haunt you for sometime. Is is so bad that the CIA has hired private contractors to show it to prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. This tells you the level of torture that awaits you if you slide this DVD into your player. God help you if you watch it and may God have mercy on your soul if you show it to others who are not prisoners of war or ""enemy combatants""!"
3,Clowns and McDonalds,"This book's thesis is sound and the book is well-written, however, it seems a very British book to me. The American church certainly needs to hear how it has become driven by consumerism and this doesn't quite hit the mark for the American context. Also, there is something a little ironic about the fact that Drane uses his wife's ministry of Christian Clowning as an example throught the book, a book about McDonaldization. I couldn't really take that seriously. The book has its moments but . . . ."
4,wow,"Loved it. I enjoy being critical and am renowned for my fussiness with regards to music, but wow, wow, wow. Least Complicated, Touch Me Fall, they make me want to cry they're so beautiful. I can't really liken the Indigo Girls to any other artist and I suppose that's part of their charm. A bit folky at times, reminiscent of classical music at others, interspersed with ballady undertones: an eclectic but highly effective mix! I know that a lot of the girls' fans are gay, but I'm not and so I'll be straight with you: Listen to it and love it!"
3,Entertainment Lite,"I also suffer from OCD, albeit a much milder form than what Emily Colas endured. I check the stove and perform some of the same rituals as the author, but I don't constantly ruminate on catching diseases from bodily fluids. So, naturally, I thought I could relate to this book. And I did. I related to a lot of it, in fact. Much of the book is funny, though not ""terribly"" so, as David Sedaris writes on the back cover of the hardback edition. (Honestly, why do some writers have to exaggerate the merits of a particular book? Are they getting paid for their fulsome praise? Sheesh.) But Emily seems to be a likable person, and I'm glad she managed to get her life back on track; not to mention get a book published! This book is a quick read. Save it for a rainy afternoon!"
3,Grateful She's Not My Neighbor...,"I just finished reading her book the other night. Colas, in my opinion, has much more to work through than merely the OCD. She doesn't offer much in her book about the relationship(s) she had with each of her parents other than to infuse the OCD ""link"" here and there. Not enough insight; on her part by choice?---or by denial? In either case, Emily needs to do a lot more than having written this book to truly ""get better"". I hope she does it. Especially for her kids."
5,Welcome back Crowded House,"This is an amazing CD, but for those unfamiliar with the talent of Neil Finn it bears listening to multiple times before it becomes readily apparent. The depth of the lyrics requires repeated playing allowing the meaning to unfold layer by layer. I saw the kickoff performance of their U.S. tour and they were in fine form. There will always be a hole where Paul Hester used to be, but Matt Sherrod has stepped up into a difficult place with grace and superb talent. Their camaraderie is enviable, their talent even more so. Favorite tracks: Pour Le Monde (achingly beautiful), English Trees, Walked Her Way Down, Even a Child, Transit Lounge--OK, I admit it, I love them all! Memorable (sometimes haunting) lyrics, beautiful vocals and instrumental music--for me, a true must-have."
4,A Fun Read,"I enjoyed this book. Even though it was published sometime back, the fact that newer discoveries were not included was not particularly relevant to the point the author is making. And the fact that he did not devote a great deal of time to humanity being a ""seeded"" race was a pleasant change of pace."
4,one of my fave cds,"This is a great cd! It's definitely worth buying this cd for the different versions of ""Sex Action"" and ""One More Reason"". ""Ritual"", ""Disbelief"", and ""Time"" are really great tracks also. The songs sound different than the original releases, but that's why I bought it. There would be no point of buying this cd if the songs all sounded the same as the original releases. If you loved the first two guns discs and Phil Lewis' sexy voice, I'm sure you'll love this one."
1,Just Bleeding the Hardcore Fans . . . . .,"I have everything that Traci has put out and this is by far the worst material he has ever put his name on. I definitely agree with the reviewer below concerning Phil Lewis. He sounds terrible. I can't believe this is the same guy who sang on the incredible ""Hollywood Vampires"" album. Even worse than Phil's performance though is the production. It makes me think they threw this thing together in a week just so they would have something to support on their reunion tour. None of the re-recorded old tracks are improvements, with the possible exception ""Ballad of Jayne"". If you don't have ""Hollywood Vampires"" or the more recent ""Shrinking Violet"" (with Jizzy Pearl), definitely check those out instead. Both of those albums rock, but this latest effort is something to be ashamed of."
4,Useful,"My original purpose in purchasing this grease was for use in my Airsoft tech use. However, I have also used it for other things as well. Seems to work just fine - it is pretty thick, so depending on what you are using it on don't apply it to liberally or it may actually gum things up. Overall a great grease to have around."
5,It's grease,What can you say about grease? It's for tune ups on your motor vehicle. Permatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.
4,Does the job.,"The tube was a little bigger than I expected so I can afford to use it generously. I use it on electrical contacts (especially batteries) and so far, no corrosion and always good connections.Why only 4 stars? It's a tube of grease."
4,Great product,"I started using the Nucelle Mandelic Serum 10% about two years ago and noticed a dramatic decrease in my acne. Now I have updated to the 15% and while for the initial week you do breakout heavily I have noticed that two weeks later my skin looks clear and glowing. It tends to burn a little bit when you put it on, especially if you have sensitive skin. But nothing works like it for getting rid of acne. I have tried everything, proactive, birth control, etc. This is an amazing product."
4,Great quality at a price and compatibility premium,"This 5-pack of Panasonic DVD-RAMs is excellent. You can use and reuse them to record your favorite TV shows without having to worry about wearing down your VCR and VHS tapes.However, they do cost more than DVD-RW/+RW. Some DVD recorders supporting the DVD-RW(VR) mode offer similar capabilities as DVD-RAM based recorders. Also a number of PC-based DVD burners and stand-alone home electronics dvd players do not support DVD-RAM, so you have to trade-off these factors as well.But DVD-RAMs are not as exclusive/isolated as let's say Sony's MemoryStick. DVD recorders from Panasonic, JVC, Toshiba, Samsung and LG use DVD-RAMs. Panasonic DVD players can playback DVD-RAM for sure.So while this 5-pack of media is highly recommended for its quality and durability, I am giving it 4-stars because at the same time you have to trade-off the higher price of DVD-RAM (vs DVD-RW/+RW) and playback availability."
3,For the Hard Core,AS a regular guy this book was much to advanced for me. It was very detailed and if I was looking to compete at the front of the pack it would be much more useful.
5,Excellent Training Guide,"This book presents a well-written look at triathlon training and will help almost any athlete train more effectively. It tells you what is known and what is not known about tri training, and provides an excellent base of information upon which you can experiment and develop a plan that works for you. It really is a book about how to train as opposed to one that explains how to run, bike, or swim. No single book can do all that, but this book will show you how to put all three sports together in a plan to improve your performance."
2,Better to Buy Hide-A-Squirrel,"My 2 dachshunds loved, loved, loved Hide-A-Squirrel. They still play with the ""hides"" after chewing them open so the stuffing & squeaker are gone. Fortunately, they had lots of play before they chewed the squirrels open. Not so with the birds...they chewed off the beaks in a couple days with stuffing everywhere. Unfamiliar with Hide-A-Bee (it has one 5 star rating). Better to buy Hide-A-Squirrel. Note there are refill squirrels available."
4,great toy,"My dog loves this bird house. I also stuff her other small toys in there, she loves trying to get them out!"
4,Not that much rumble,"For subwoofers placement is key and can make or break your subwoofer. I have mine in a corner-ish spot, but it still doesn't give that chest pounding bass. Oh well, It's small so that's good for me because I'm using it with my PC.I have this connected to a Harmon Kardon Hk3390 receiver and On the back of the sub I set the volume 3/4 and on the receiver I set the bass knob to 3/4 aswell maybe it is defective because there the subwoofer only responds when the volume is 3/4 or higher. One thing to note is that it is very musical, it's not like those massive one note car subs that only go boom."
4,Awesome bass,"Bought this to be the sub for my monitor -70' + CS2 (newegg had an amazing deal going on these) since the paired PSW-125 was another monster and the WAF was treading low. Surprisingly this sub has delivered, havent been able to drive it with specific audio but overall during the HD shows this has been good."
1,"Potenciometer problems, Dissapointed performance","well first at all i not a newbie at sub woofers, i was expecting a really good performance of this sub, but even my old sony sub has the same or even better performance for the half of the price, i compare the two subs, Sony SA W2500 Subwoofer vs polk audio psw 111 and i was disappointed with the polk, besides that, i had problems with the volumen control of the polk sub, when i try to adjust the volume i get a hummer noise very loud and annoying even if i just move the sub i get the hum, it seems like there is a quality problem with the volume pot, i did some research and seems to be a common problem, the sub i believe still on warranty i bough it 3 weeks ago, but is heavy and for sure i will pay shipping in order to get it fixed and it wont be cheap, so be carefully with this sub. spend less and get a sony i never had problems with it and the performance is equal or better"
4,The Human Body: Fearfully and Wonderfully Made,Haven't used it. Son's class was canceled and we are stuck with the book.
5,AN INTRIGUING KALEIDOSCOPE OF THE REAL HISTORY OF WITCHES,"What a pleasure to see the realm of witches and witchcraft as well as wizards and magic from a true historical viewpoint, rather than another book on Wicca. Enthralling and entertaining, upbeat and fun. I had no idea my view of witches was based solely on childhood memories of black-hatted, warty and pocked, evil old ladies. I was surprised to find that witches and such were quite different than I would have ever imagined. Golden- and raven-haired beauties, wives and lovers... Who knew?"
2,Not up to par,"This last adventure of the Mad Scientist Club is not up to par with the previous books. I found it somewhat tedious and uneventful. I bought it with much anticipation, but I was disappointed by the book."
3,Least favorite,"The Mad Scientist Club collection by Bertrand R Brinley stands as one of the great series in young adult adventure fiction. His first two books (Adventures of ... and New Adventures of...) are classics with no peer. The following two books (Kerplop and Ice) suffer from the long novel format and the introduction of an adult character lead (Dr Stratavarious). The strengths of the first two books are that the kids run the show with no adult interference, and that they are gritty and believable. With the arrival of Stratavarious an adult became the leader and the complete unbelievability of the Stratavarious character ruins the whole mood and tone of stories. If you have kids, grandkids, neices, nephews, friends, etc in the 8 to 13 year old range, buy them the first two books, its not too late to get them off the Wii and facebook and back reading again."
5,The Outsiders inside the house on Night Of The Living Dead,"Another low budget shot on video zombie/infected human movie. The difference is that the directing behind this movie makes it. Yes, of course the acting really isn't anything to write home about. The gore was great (thanks to Ricky Lee) and the location of the Red Skulls house was such a great choice. It added that alone, confined feeling that Night Of The Living Dead had.Check it out, I loved it."
4,"Very useful, if somewhat out of date...","There is much useful material, along with a thoughtful approach to creating a daytrading discipline, in this book. I don't fully agree with (and wouldn't expect to) all of Lewis' statements, and, as you might expect, given the changes in the trading environment over the last couple of years, many of his methods and observations are arguably already out of date, but others still apply, and his overall philosophy, perspective, and attitude are probably more important, in my opinion, than the particulars of his personal approach as practiced in and around late 2000. The text includes numerous clear, concrete, and detailed examples, though you may have to look past an L2 screen with a stack of QCOM buyers at 343 13/16 (I just never get over mania-market prices) to receive the message."
2,Don't buy for house hunting!!! Its missing streets.,"This map is missing many many streets both in the index and the actual map. I agree its OK for walking around the metro area,but if you're doing some serious 'locating' such as house orapartment hunting then get the Rand McNally Portland EasyFinder.It, too, is lamenated ISBN 0-528-99102-7"
5,everyone uses mine,"my gong hee makes its rounds in the family ,iam on my third one it is always someting to go back and check on what it said about your future and see how close it was.iam greatly satasfied with the service"
1,no power and no filters,"This would be a marginal cleaner if it had power; after 3 minutes of use the tiny, fragile filter [for which replacements do not exist] gets full and you must stop, remove and clean this useless filter. Be careful, it's made of thin paper and if you tear it you might as well throw the vacuum away. I have waited in vain since August 2005 for replacement filters. It is now January 2006. Still waiting."
5,Just getting better,"The Spankers are just getting better. ""My Favorite Record"" demonstrates some real growth and polish of this original all-acoustic, non-categorizable Austin band. The new songs--music and tunes--are great; the musianship of Christina, Wammo, Stanley, Corey and the gang is outstanding. If you are a Spanker fan, or think you might want to be, this album is a must!"
5,hooded jacket,I love this jacket. It is so warm and stylish. I have gotten many compliments on it.Amazon is the best!!! The price could not be beat and the delivery was fast. Thanks!!!
4,funny book!,"My 4 year old daughter loves this book and wants me to read it over and over. Pigs Aplenty, Pigs Galore is also another favorite"
5,Definitive Resource,"Without a doubt, Furbank's work is a great resource for any student of Forster. While working on my thesis , his book was always close at hand. Forster readers will appreciate the attention to detail that helps enliven any reading of one of Forster's novels."
3,Smart dogs might not stay entertained,"Our 17-month-old husky figured out how to get the bees out of the hive pretty quickly and was relatively entertained for a day or two. By day three or four (when she'd figured out how to take the bees out in 12 seconds flat), she grew pretty tired of it. We've now had the bees for 2-3 weeks and Mochi will deign to play with the bees maybe once every few days. Darn dog. Darn Hide-A-Bee."
4,The hive's the best part,"This is a visually appealing and interactive, fuzzy toy. My puppy really enjoys chewing on the hive more than pulling out the bees, however. I have to admit that it's not her favorite, but she has a huge basket of toys to choose from. I bought the Hide-A-Toy Bird for a friend's dog. Love the bright colors on the birds and the cute little birdhouse."
5,Great dog toy,I got this as a christmas present for my sister's dog. She says her dog loves the challenge of removing the bees from the hive.
1,not what you promised,My poodle is bored with this toy with in two days she no longer cared to play with it yea she got the bees out and then that was it she did not want to play she has other toys and she would rather play with them I bought 2 other products same as the bees one is with the eggs the other the tree I am not a happy camper I will never buy again.
3,No match for a 90 lb. German Shepherd.,"I thought I'd get this for my dog after talking to a friend about a similar puzzle she got for her pitbull. I definitely think this toy is more designed for dogs that are more...subtle in their methods of extracting the bees, because mine just decided it would be faster if he ripped the thing open. This took all of about 30 minutes. Don't get me wrong, he loves it and carries the mangled hive around with him where ever he goes including out into the yard, but I think this toy is better for smaller dogs or ones that won't choose brute force over ""problem solving"". Not to say my boy isn't smart. That's just it, he figured it'd be faster to get the bees after shaking them out and chewing them out, than by normal methods of retrieval."
3,Destroyed in no time,"I hate to be the one to say, that this toy is only as good as your dog is to its toys. My sweet, sweet non-agressive, lover of a Cavalier King Charles destroyed this toy to shreds in under three days. To be completely fair, he does this to all his plush toys, but the overwhelmingly positive reviews led me to believe that this toy set was ultra durable. I now know I must stick to tough-as-bone elk antlers and bully stick..."
5,Hide a bee pet toy,This is one of the best toys I have ever bought for my dogs. They love it to death. They beat it up and toss the toys everywhere when they shake it out. They wait for me to put the bees back in the hive and go at it again. It is so much fun to watch. I would buy this one again and again. They also make refill bees if they destroy the bees to replace them with. Although I think my dogs will need to replace the entire hive when they are done with it.
3,Really fun but build quality is so so,Gave this toy to my 20 lb doggy yesterday and he loves playing with the thing. It took about 2 minutes for him to pull the bee out and then he'd realize there's another two inside. Unfortunately he ended up chewing the inside roof of the beehive and tore the seam off. He got to a bunch of the stuffing and I ended up removing all the stuffing so he doesn't eat any. The bees themselves seem pretty sturdy.But yes he loves the toy so much he ended up doing the birds and the bees with the hive.
2,so-so,"This is simply water sealed up in thin plastic. They freezed and seemed to work ok, but they needed to be dried prior to putting them back in the freezer so they didn't freeze together. You almost need to find a special box for the freezer to keep them in. Otherwise, they fall through the wire shelves and/or get scattered around the freezer.I ended up throwing them away and using the hard plastic ones that are roughly the size of a pack of cigarettes. They were not horrible, but they were not worth the hassle."
2,"GOOD TOPIC, HAPHAZARD GISTS","The motive of this book is very fine, but its factual presentation is the exact opposite.Starting with the first chapter, John Man's intention to initiate his audience into the ancient Chinese writings brought confusion to both himself and his audience. Information about the ancient Egyptian writings are not better. They were presented in hazy haphazard manner. It is easy to lose patience with the very first part.The author had scarcely understood his topic before rushing into teaching his audience.Nevetheless, I must add that if the needed homework is accomplished, Mr Man would come up with a better book: a very interesting piece. But as regards the current situation, most readers would get lost in this book. It is that confusing!"
3,A great idea but a disappointment,"I really looked forward to reading this book as a source of inspiration, but I think the editor ends up missing the boat by overzealously trying to preserve the ironman's own words. This means that crucial facts about people's lives are left out, or the reader is plunged into the middle of the tale, not really understanding whose story is being told, or why we should care. Rather than having the effect of making the race more immediate, this ends up making all of the stories seem alike. We don't necessarily get backstory about who this person is, or from where he/she got the drive to do this ironman, or why. The stories are often told as if the teller is speaking to a good friend, who already knows everything about the speaker, and just needs to hear how this one race went. I hope if the editor decides to follow up this volume with another, she heeds this critique. I would love to buy another volume, but only if more information about the athletes is included."
3,Insightful,Proabably a good book to read prior to ever doing triathlon (especially a long course) as it gives some interesting insights into the trials and tribulations of entering the sport and the physical and/or mental impact it can have. Appreciated the fact that there was age groupers and people who didn't finish before the time cut off included in the stories
1,Dont Waste Your Money,"We installed the heater, started the motor to circulate the coolant,ran the motor for 30 minutes or so, plugged in the heater and it burned up in 5 minutes. Junk. Don't waste your money on this unit. Couldn't return because the shipping was more than the cost. A complete waste of money and time. Buy something local and get the support that you deserve."
2,Uncomfortable and complicated,"It was way too hard and annoying to figure out - we used it once, for like 5 minutes. Great idea if it had less buckles.Don't waste the $$$ - you can have mine!"
4,Brother labels,"These are good labels but the ""Brother"" brand name is expensive. There are other companies that make compatible labels for less and they seem to work just fine."
3,Didn't really do what I expected.,"The piece is nice enough. But it much larger than expected. That could be a good thing - but not well suited as carry on. (I will need to do something different for overnight trips.) And speaking of suits, this doesn't keep them looking nice any better than a regular suitcase, and worse than a traditional garment bag.Delivery was timely. No issues with the seller. This piece just wasn't quite what I was expecting."
3,"Great for suits, maybe not 100% carry-on sized","This bag holds a surprising amount of clothing and seems to be constructed fairly well. It is much wider than a standard roller bag, as you would expect it to be if it's able to fit a men's suit on a hangar. It is shorter and thinner than a standard roller bag and does not have an expander zipper. We did manage to get it on board two American Airlines flights as a carry-on but I'm not sure if other airlines or gate agents would be so approving."
4,good purchase,"Needed a garment bag for a destination wedding. I don't travel enough to justify a more expensive one, this one was great. We fit a dress', 2 pairs of pants dress shirt and jacket, plus plenty of room for other items."
2,"Seemed good, until it was used","My husband used this for the first time on a business trip to Las Vegas this past week, and when I opened it up, the part that the shirts and suits hangs on was broken off during handling at the airport. It was a good price at $47, but I'm going to return it and invest my money in something of better quality. That little piece was the whole reason for buying a garment bag for suits, and without it, the luggage is useless."
1,did not work,I ended up having notifications on my vehicle that something was not working right. Mechanic told me that it was the locking gas cap I had recently put on.
1,Junk,"I was scammed on this one, it was cheap so I bought a used one that said still in box. Someone did a wrap job on it. It didn't work so I called Vonage and they tracked the serial number back to the original owner that wss a small business and used it a lot and had numerous trouble calls on it. Vonage sent me the new model for free and everything works again. My advice, don't buy any electronic products you suspect have been used, there is a reason someone is selling them. This little scam cost me a lot of time and effort and lost us a lot of calls."
3,Great Starter Game,"I have an Eight Year Old, Six year old and a Four year old. They are all big Scooby Doo fans and they love this game. They are probably not representative of hard core game players, because they only played PC games before and we are new to PS2.However, the ""feel"" of this game is that you are in a Scooby Doo episode, complete with jokes and canned laughter. As it is a learning experience for all of us, it is taking time to get through the game, so they are not growing bored with it quickly.At times the game can seem a little slow, too much dialogue and not enough action, and I can see that becoming a problem in future.But, for the moment, it is fun. It is very much aimed at young children, with no adult language or themes, no blood, guts or murder. All in all I think it was a good purchase to get the kids into PS2 games."
2,Bad art & cliches hamper this what if,This tale of What If? in the Star Wars universe is pretty cliched and the art is so basic and cartoony that the overall story is really setback. The characters are still recognizable but the basic looking art with bland backgrounds make it a little hard to even get into the ridiculously cliched story. Innovation was nowhere to be found here. Just run of the mill.
5,Very impressed,"Like the looks of it, it's more low-profile than the taller microwave we had, but is extremely spacious inside. Does a great job of heating from the inside-out. All in all, a great bargain and a great product. Also, fairly easy to learn to operate. Couldn't have asked for more."
4,Systematists beware!,"Plant taxonomists and systematists and other sticklers for keeping up on the most modern plant names (always changing as we learn more about DNA vs. observation alone) might balk at this book. Or even get their posies in a knot!But for the rest of us mortals, Britton and Brown has some of the best drawings packed into these volumes. The attention to detail is incredible - the USDA PLANTS database uses these very drawings (and descriptions) in it's identification of species. These books simply are a classic guide for identification. It's true, once you've pinned down what it is here, you can go to a more modern guide for more modern information. But you're more likely to get a color photo of just the flower and not the rest of the plant! Very frustrating. My advice - have this book (this series) in addition to new field guides. Remind yourself how much work people used to put into this art and science of taxonomy."
3,just ok,"i am extremely pleased with my purchase, it is better than expected. Fast shipping, product in perfect condition, very good quality. would recommend."
4,franklin songs,Product was in very good condition. The songs are cute sounding since they they are sung in the voices of the characters of the show. Songs are a little short. Great for 3-5 year olds who still watch the show.
3,Good but not Great,When I first saw the review for this book in the Detroit Free Press it sounded like something I would like. Sailing and adventure on the high sea. Let me first tell you that it did fulfill that expectation.But it was not written very well and in some places was hard to follow.The reason I gave it three stars was because it was very exciting and had a excellent plot but in some parts it was confusing because of the bad writing. * If you really enjoyed this book you'll love The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle *
3,Not for Pinball Purists...,"This game looked good at first, but after playing each table a few times, various shortcomings become apparent.First, there's no "" Plunger "" to launch the ball. You just press the A button, and the ball shoots out at the same speed and angle every time.Next, some of the tables have "" Cheat moves "" where a player can easily repeatedly do a simple ball flip to continuously rack up points. This is just a poor table design and very unsatisfying for a real pinball fan.The graphics look nice, but there are too many spots where the ball is not visible because of poor camera angles.The soundtracks are possibly the best part of this package, each is appropriate to the table's theme.Check out "" Williams Collection Pinball Hall of Fame "" for some super realistic pinball games with virtually unlimited replayability."
4,Bought this book to help search for family from Narewka,"I wrote a longer review for the Narewka mailing list I run, if you want to joing send a blank message to narewka-subscribe@j-geek.org.Finally this Shabbat we received the long awaited Bialystock book (Jewish Bialystok and Surroundings in Eastern Poland, by Tomasz Wisniewksi), I spent one afternoon on Succot reading it.The book was small only 147 pages and I was able to read half of it in one afternoon. It is well written and provides a good insight into how people must have lived in the region. It also inspired my father and I to want to visit the area, perhaps in the next year.The 'chapter' on Narewka was brief, about three pages."
4,Columbo movie,I bought this DVD for my 95 year old Mom. She lives with me now and we are enjoying these mysteries and Peter Falk as much as ever!
3,Ham Sandwich,"Perhaps it's becasue that majority of Columbo was produced in the early 70s, an era far more distant in the social conscious than the late 80s, that I can be forgiving of the awful affectations of those earlier actors than those captured here. But stilted and hammy is hardly adequate to describe the downright distracting badness of most of the acting in these episodes. I'm sorry, I love Columbo, I really do, but fans, it really is OK to miss these."
5,Great product!,"Bought this to basically listen to Sirius at work but didn't want to have a big boom box on my desk. I get great reception and I am not even near a window. Easy to set up, and I listen to it through a radio on my desk.. fm reception."
2,Audiovox - Serrius Satelite Receiver,"This unit is only applicable for a car and Audivox does not support it and I could not get a home adapter kit for it. So I had to buy a JVC unit and since it was opened, I could not return it"
5,The best from Brazil !!!!!!!!!,"This cd gives you a sample of brazilian sounds mixed with good progressive rock made by an excellent brazilian rock band!!!!!! Sounds of this type are rare from that country, specially the rock and roll part, so it's a must have if you want to know mora about angra's work!!!!!!! EXCELLENT BAND !!!!!It's got some sounds that reminds classical music !!!Just try to imagine....progressive rock mixed with classical and brazilian sounds........This cd is great !!!!!!!!!Most of the sounds remounts the colonization era....The great navigators, priests and princess.It's just got beautiful songs !!!"
5,A ProgMetal Masterpiece!,"Holy Land is one of the best-written progressive metal dics I've ever heard. The instruments and arrangements are simply outstanding. With the exception of Dream Theater's discs, I don't think I've ever heard music that's just put together so well. The title track has a definite Latin feel to it; ""Make Believe"" is simply a stunning ballad. This disc has it all- power, emotion, variety, etc. A masterpiece. You won't be disappointed."
4,very good but not all I had hoped,"Angra is a very talented band and definitely one of my favorite progressive metal acts ever, though slightly below Dream Theater :) ""Holy Land"" is a well-played album, there's no denying that these guys truly know what they're doing in terms of the songwriting department. But what keeps this CD from being totally awesome is the filler material it leans to towards the last 5 or so tracks. ""Nothing to Say"" and ""Carolina IV"" are awesome songs, but then after the title track it just kind of gets unimaginative. I personally prefer ""Angel's Cry"" over this album, and even their latest ""Fireworks"" isn't the horrible garbage that people seem to be slandering so much. ""Holy Land"" is worth a buy for prog fans especially since the instrumentation and musicianship are so great, but if you want a perfect prog album (sorry to make this comparison but I can't help myself), then buy Dream Theater's ""Scenes From a Memory."" This CD is still worth your money though."
3,Better than nothing,"Using waterproof epoxy, I glued the wire into the handle and it stopped spinning around. Now it works better. The wire is still a little too flimsy to make this the perfect tool. It would have helped if the wire had been stainless steel. I suspect this will not last long because the wire has started rusting after one shower. An excellent idea, they just fell short on the follow through.UPDATE: It is now June 25th, 2011 and I am amazed to report this item is still being used. I never expected this item to last even half this long and I see no reason why it would stop being useful any time soon.Based on this experience, I would increase my rating to four stars - it should still have a stainless steel wire and I shouldn't have had to epoxy in the handle. Other than that, a great product."
1,"So bad, I love it!","Where else can you find a movie with every cliche from the early '70's? Blacula has it all. From the cheesy music to the cake-flour make-up. I can watch this again and again, and enjoy every minute of camp.Thank you American International for creating such amazing films."
2,blacula= pointless.,"this is a cheezy flick, pam grier is the only reason to watch, other than that this movie and its sequel is better to watch on cable."
4,Sarcophagus better than Ultraworld,"Only the six regulars appear in Sarcophagus, which opened the door to some character development. Jan Chappell's Cally, however, is (once again) the weak link in the chain, her psi-powers the conduit for somebody to take over the Liberator. Paul Darrow's Avon may have feelings towards Cally, but this isn't developed in the series. Writer Tanith Lee developed a much more interesting relationship between Tarrant and the baddie, Servalan in ""Sand."" For a lighter and less emotional trip, I suggest Trevor Hoyle's ""Ultraworld"" which, complete with disco-ball alien world, Michael Keating's Vila making bad jokes, and a lot of running through corridors, is a laugh riot. The former is slightly better than the latter because it presents a kind of mystery and deals with characters, whereas the latter shows a lot of very cheap-looking effects."
3,Left me Wondering???,The book came in perfect condition that was a plus but after reading it and showing it to friends they told me he was not creditible and FBI was after him so now Im afraid to try his rememdy's but he is convincing and a lot of what is in the book about natural foods and organic foods did help me but I think all and all I wasted my money on his books. Read live and learn
1,Con-man out to make money.,"Where are the citations? There are no references, he tells you to go to websites to find the answers! Why not just go to WebMD? Why should I trust a man wearing a suit and a tie, he's not even a doctor! Ludicrous, don't waste your money in all the hype."
5,For the smart person that is not brainwashed,"Drugs are poison, this is the real deal. Thanks Kevin for putting the truth there!! I use this book to remain healthy!!Paul"
2,TOO MUCH FILLER,"This book contains some interesting information on health problems and cures, but is 80% filler, praising the author."
1,A Natural Sales person,"His book tells you the same thing everyone already knows, The FDA is there to make money,not to have cures found."
1,Where is an editor when you need one?,"His earlier book ""Natural Cures"" was more hype than substance, but at least it *had* substance.This book is mostly paranoid ranblings, rantings about big business, medicine, and pharmaceuticals, and more claims that Mr Trudeau is /was part of some ""illuminati"" like secret society.I suppose this could be a great novel about the secret plots in big business and one man's fight against it, or a good alternative health book, with product recomendations... unfortunately it isnt either one.There are only a couple of product names or recomendations in the book, certainly not what the cover leads you to believe. No therapies, treatments, or wonder products by name, just more hints and ""there is a great cure"" noises, followed by sending you to his pay to view, members only, webpage.Save your time. If you think he has the answers, just pay to join the webpage, he doesnt give you anything worth the money in the book."
4,Informed Patient,This book gives people a chance to check out alternative natural treatments before heading to the doctor.
4,Natural Cures Info,"I appreciate Kevin Trudeau's books. This book give so much information that I could not get elsewhere, as well as tips to keep me and my family healthy. The only thing this book lacks is a good index."
2,"Same old, but with specifics","He says what he wants to say, and is not loathe to say it again and again, at least with names for some products in this book."
5,quick delivery & nice packing,I recieved the book within 3 days and i am up north. I recieved the book safe and sound and a safe packing.
2,Betsy,"Kevin Trudeau has an understandable vendetta against the government, big drug companies and modern medicine at large but he goes on about things that I already knew. Then, wanting his magic answers to the natural cures, he refers readers to his website where he asks a monthly membership fee. In the end, you come away devoid of any alternative health solutions, unless you want to spring for his fee to access the website. I call that a bunch of hype and empty promises. How do I know whether or not his website is any more informative than his tease of a book?"
1,Worse than the last one (if that's possible),"I remember Kevin when he visited me at Area 51. We were in a wormhole together, and it was full of electromagnetic energy (I remember it well because it was the first time anyone ever asked me to give them a colonic). I explained to him how we use this energy on my planet to heal ourselves, and I guess he took that to heart. Unfortunately, our experiments have shown it doesn't work on humans - it just makes for another lousy book.Buy at your own risk - even on Uranus we know better. And be sure to put tinfoil inside your hats. It keeps us from reading your thoughts!"
1,Same as before,Why should I review this book only to have it rejected? ? My review of the first Trudeau book was rejected because I referred to the author. Many other reviews referred to the author more than I did.Robert Morrisette
1,"What a huckster; dangerous, too","My wife recommended Kevin Trudeau's ""More Natural Cures Revealed"" to me, while she was trying to follow his recommendations. While I read, I periodically looked at his web site and realized this huckster was selling everything under the sun ...including a major government conspiracy. When I got to the part that Trudeau claimed that overexposure to the sun doesn't cause skin cancer...I started digging deeper in this con artist's past. (My late wife died from Melanoma). His book targets the ignorant, and desperate, and those who see government conspiracy behind every bush (no pun intended). Don't waste your money. His recommendations are as useless and dangerous as the scores of Mexican cancer clinics in south of the border."
2,"Blah, blah, FTC, blah, blah blah","Mr. Trudeau is so full of himself and his whining about the FTC gets tiring. I ordered this book ""Free"" from an informercial, paying for only shipping and handling. Once received, I kept reading to get to the real information. Finally found ""Ch. 6"" - I have researched a lot of the cures he recommends and some are real keepers. The only think I can give him credit for is that the book has all the data in one place ""Ch.6"" and the website links, but I won't sign up for his website and it will be the last book I buy from this ""consumer advocate, journalist, ad nauseaum."""
1,"Marketing, marketing, martketing","If you want good health books, get Mikhail Tombaks..Cure the Incurable and How we can live 150 years(I don't want to, just a figure of speech).....common sense approach without all the hype"
1,Mission Impossible,"While I have no doubt that the author has extensive research involved in the natural cures presented in this book, it is almost impossible for the common human to go through the processes that the author offers as cures or preventatives for illnesses. Most of the cures are time-consuming processes involving complex procedures over a long period of time with raw materials mostly unavailable to most people in most areas of the country."
3,"Works well, but...","We purchased two of these timers to control the tv and video game time for our kids. The concept and ease of use is great, but they do not work with newer TV's due to the low power consumption. The timer does not recognize that the LED tv is on, so it automatically shuts off. You can program it to stay on, but then it incessantly beeps at you when the time has expired. On the old style Tube television it works flawlessly."
1,Easily Defeated,"The product's lock and key mechanism is very easily defeated by a determined teenager. The lock needs to be much, much more secure. I also found the settings I programmed (no restriction on duration but lock out at midnight) didn't function - the power stayed on after midnight. The product might be effective for a younger child, but it was a waste of money for my situation."
2,Infuriating,It works very well at keeping my child off the TV 24/7. The thing that I hate about it is that it has some kind of sensor that turns Bob off when the TV is turned off. The problem is that it turns it off far more often than it should. Just a few days ago it turned it off twice in 30 minutes. I've never had it go for more than a hour or two without turning it off. They really do need to make it so that you can disable this feature.
2,TV Bob keeps shutting off!,"My husband purchased this device about 3 years ago to reduce the amount of time my daughter watched tv while we were at work. She's not sneaky like the other teenagers I read in other reviews and as far as I can tell she never spent time trying to trick the machine. The problem we have is when we're trying to watch a movie (like right now!) or play a video game and the damn machine keeps beeping and shutting off. I have had to get up 5 times in the last 10 minutes to reenter MY code so that TV Bob doesn't shut off the tv. My husband said that he thinks that the new, lower energy tv that we bought doesn't draw enough power and TV Bob thinks that it needs to shut down. It is VERY annoying!"
4,Lots of fun...for awhile,Got this for our two dachies. Lots of fun and play time with it for awhile.Didn't take them long to figure out how to get the pieces off and because it's a multi-piece toy they could each have their share. Wouldn't you know that 'the head' was the prize!One of our dachies is a destuffer/desqueaker. It didn't take her long to do both.Can't blame the produce as she is a master as it.
3,Good for 2 years of daily docking.,"Sirius radio content is great. I like the fact that the Audiovox docks in the house and car. Except for the fact that it got hot, it performed very well. I've had the SIR-PNP2 since January 2004 the unit died February 2006. The pins from the socket on the inside of the unit wore down and the audio started cutting in and out. The main board has a socket that takes pins from the extranal socket that fits the docking stations. So, if you're going to buy this type of unit expect it to wear out after a couple years of taking it between the house and car every day. My wife leaves hers in the car, so she's fine. I switched to a home based unit (SR-H550) to make MP3s of my favorite shows. NPR is on FM for the drive to and from work anyway. The SR-H550 sounds better and doesn't get even get warm."
4,Good Lifetime-Esque Emotional Punk,"Junction 18 sounds like a much poppier version of Lifetime; for the most part. The lyrics are well-written, and the musicianship is very good as well. Fearless Records classifies them as a mix between Weezer and Saves the Day, but I really don't here any Weezer in the mix of things. Anyways, so long as your not totally opposed to the ever so popular emo/punk hybrid, you should go buy this CD right away."
4,great listening!,"Has a variety of music, soothing and interesting but not demanding your attention. Great background. I love it, played it loads of times!"
4,this is a child's guitar and not a bad one at that,purchased for 10yr old grandchild. tuned it up all steel strings and sounds nice. good look to it and fits him well. only going to have it for 2ish yrs then he goes to a 3/4 guitar. so for 2yrs this will be just fine and at a good price!
1,Sell failed to communicate that the DVD was from Europe,"Bought the DVD and it couldn't play in the United States. The sell will not refund the DVD either. They have a picture of a normal season cover when in fact the real cover of the season says that it is European. Really shady if you ask me. Got this for someone for Christmas and it backfired, plus the seller will accept the DVDs back but will not refund me."
5,fun,"Purchased as a gift, they love the show. Another family member borrowed so this must be pretty good, I may check it out."
5,Funniest thing on TV,"I didn't watch The Big Bang Theory the first year because I didn't think I'd find it funny. I caught a random show in year 2 and laughed myself silly. Subsequently, I began to watch faithfully and bought all of the years available on DVD. TBBT still makes me laugh out loud more than any other show. I hope it keeps up the high quality and lasts forever."
5,Big Bang Theory 4th season DVD set,I really love this show and when I saw it was available on CBS website I ordered right away and have been enjoying this set.
5,big bang theory,this dvd collection is the best cant wait to see seasson 4 i have seen all seasons keep up the great work
5,The Big Bang Theory: The Complete Fourth Season,I absolutely love love love The Big Bang Theory. It's witty and funny--quality humor for a comedy show. The dvd set came well packaged and all the dvds are in fine working order. I've already watched them all.
4,Another Great Season - another good Big Bang Theory dvd set,"I love Big Bang Theory and will get the entire series on dvd. I've turned friends, coworkers, and family to BBT fans too. I agree with some of the other reviewers that some aspects of the girlfriends and plot twists may not always work, but the show is still smart, funny, and a joy to watch. I hope the writers get it together for more great seasons to come. It hasn't jumped the shark yet and I have big hopes for more enjoyment in future seasons."
1,It didn't work!,"I got this game for my little brother since he loves Scooby-Doo. He was so excited when we got it and wanted to play right away. When we tried playing it,it didn't work! :("
3,Moved a little slow but good overall,"I did like this book but I think because the writer was older it wasn't what I expected. Some parts were long and not very interesting. I did like the personal stories about the women. It did raise my awareness about something I had never heard of before, fistulas. I was also surprised to hear the writer and hospital referenced in the book Half The Sky! I am glad I read it though."
3,stylish but bulky,"recently purchased ring for my girlfriend who has petite, thin fingers. though we loved the unique look it just didnt fit her well because of its thickness. i would recommend only for those females with, well ""stronger, thicker"" hands if i may say."
2,ethnography and the 21st century,"Having recently visited Nepal, where I bought a copy of this spectacularly arrogant book (Thamel namaste), I have felt moved to write this review. In the fullness of time, I have no doubt that history will not kindly judge authors of Adams' genre. Ethnography, race and culturality are fraught subjects and just as the prevalent works of the late 19th century describe Africans as ""unreliable and savage beasts undeserving of their upright posture..... prone to unreasonable rages.....etc etc etc "", so Adams' curious conclusions will outrage. Stop scrutinising those lovely folk please! They're as human as you and me. And no more books on other folks - this is the new millennium."
2,pointless,the only point in buying is if you set it on your carpet or something with fuzz and stuff in it.Get the vertical stand instead.
1,Pointless,"Why would you pay money for this? It's not like your PS2 will fall over if jostled when sitting flat. This product has no point whatsoever except to look good. And even still, it doesn't add much to the looks of your PS2."
5,"Great Fun, Great Read!",This entire series is fun to read. The character developement and plot twists are fascinating in the extreme. Just when you think it can't get better it does! The entire Starfist series is a 'have to' read.
3,Happy death metal,"Bands that do not transform their sound over time may hold onto their original fan base but usually do not gain new fans. While fans of old school Metallica, for example, curse anything after the ""black"" album (actually most include it in their beration) few dispute the change in their style has increased their popularity. Colony is yet another example of a band's growth merely to avoid stagnation. While not the best In Flames album, its melodic, major chord progression collection does not deviate from their original musical direction. The instruments compliment each other nicely and most of the riffs are rather catchy and danceable, not normally a characteristic of this genre. I admire bands that try a new direction as to discern one album from another, but, if you're new to In Flames, try Whoracle first."
1,Junk,"First, based on the picture I assumed I was getting an original cartridge, so I was disappointed when I recevied two remanufactured cartridges. The cartridges barely worked for 20 pages before they began leaving large ink blots all over the paper. The two cartridges were unusable within 2 days. I will be filing a complaint with Amazon."
5,A++ sevice,"I bought a cartridge from this company and it lasted over a year. I purchased two more cartridges from this company about 8 months ago. When I went to replace, one was defective and I asked about a return. It had been more than 180 days and the company was not obligated to replace; however, since it was only a few days passed the 180 days they made an exception. I left on vacation and did not return the product for a couple of weeks, even then they accepted my return and replaced the cartridge. This is one of the most satisfying experience in true customer service that I have encountered. They offer a great product for an excellent price and they actually care about the customer. The reason I didn't replace within the 180 days was because a cartridge I ordered more than a year ago was stil working!If you want a good quality cartridge at a great price and excellent service, go with these guys!!!!!"
5,COULDN'T STOP LAUGHING!,This is the funniest book I've ever read! I just couldn't stop laughing -- and got more of a laugh because they're all true!
2,Not like meat...,"Good flavor but strange texture. Some people compare this to meat, I wouldn't. Tender Bits are in a category of their own. Buy one at the store, not the whole case."
5,Tender Bits,"I looked all over in every health food store for this product..found them on Amazon & paid way less that I would at the store, plus free shipping! Very Happy"
3,okay system but screen is tiny,"I bought this for my parents since they like the game. While functional, the system screen is a bit tiny."
1,Impractical,"I bought this for my husband as there isn't really anything I can get him that if we want things we just get them. So to get him a gift even a small one. I figured I would try this one. WEll, the print on it was so small he had a hard time seeing it. I tried to use it too and the pictures were also too small.The same with the solitaire game it too was too small.I am going back quite a few years now. We had gone through two solitaire games. I think it had a flip cover too. I don't really remember or not. Anyway the print on that was great. The size was compact and used it all the time. After the second one finally stopped working the only ones we could find were the really wide ones which are not comfortable to hold.So, now you have it. We have another Radica solitaire, it is yellow and wide. It's just okay but when there aren't any other ones we have to settle for less.Yours truly,Pauline J. Demers"
4,Fabulous,"Excellent!!! This is the second book I have read by Rebecca Foster. Loved them both. Great story, twisted plot, couldn't put it down. Fabulous."
4,Priviled Witness,As with all of Rebecca Forester books you have to wait till the very end to find out who the rotten person is. Makes for a real page turner.
1,Big waste of time.,"This book was my first by this author...and the last! The chapters dragged on, skipping from one plotline to the other for no apparent reason. The characters were two dimensional, the plotline was muddled and scattered and through90% of the book there was barely any action. I had so much time to ponder the book's outcome during the pages and pages of boredom that I had basically figured out the predictable ending two/thirds of the way into the book. It was like being fed crumbs for the first 11 hours and then in the final hour having the entire meal shoved down your throat. It was one of those books that I couldn't wait to put down. The kind you keep reading hoping it will get better but it doesn't, but by then you've invested so much time into it you feel obligated to finish reading it.Also, I assumed it was a legal thriller, but the courtroom barely entered into it. I can't believe she got thisbook published!"
2,Way too expensive and too oily,I bought this and I use it for a month. I din't notice any change on my face. I'm 38 years and i have small wrinkles around my eyes and my mouth. I also bought the night cream. Overall i looked like bathe in oil. Dont waste the money. It too greasy.
5,"A welcome addition to any personal, academic, or community library DVD collection.","""Ambient Space: The Best of NASA Photos, Volume 1"" offers an armchair journey into the vastness of space with spectacular images of galaxies, nebulae, the Solar System, Planet Earth, early scenes of NASA, space flight, the shuttle, and the Hubble Space Telescope, as well as other exotic sights and conceptual art.

5,toner,this is an extra toner for when the new one runs out. always like to keep a back up and will order anonther when I install this one.
5,WEST OAKLAND CA BAD BOYS LIKE WHAA WHAA,THIS CD IS TITE WATCH OUT FA THESE WEST OAKLAND BOYS THEY BOUTS 2 BLOW UP IN THIS RAP GAME 1000 CYPRESS WEST OAKLAND P-HOUSE
3,Sherlock Holmes vs. Jack the Ripper,"'The Whitechapel Horrors' is just one of many that pit the Great Detective against the world's best known serial killer.For this type of book, the questions are: is Sherlock Holmes portrayed in a way consistent with the writings of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle? And does the Jack the Ripper chronology fit the facts?In this book, Edward Hanna does a good job with both.The sad part is that he doesn't do it better. There are no great surprises in this book. The ""true"" identity of Jack the Ripper (according to this book) is a fairly well-known one, one of the more publicly known theories, which mean that the theory has been expounded many times.Not bad, but not interesting enough to get too excited about."
4,Great recipes and wonderful history.,"I ""stole"" this book from my mother and my ex ""stole"" it from me. I am real happy to have found it online. All the wonderful foods of my youth are in there...and it's great to be able to explain to your dinner guest the origins of a particular dish. You will love it so much, you'll ask for seconds (smile)"
1,Got a lemon,"I bought the new play station 11 Dec 05, 2005 and placed it along side of my game cube that I had had since Dec 2004.I played games on both systems off and on during the year actually using the game cube more than the playstation 11. First week in January 2006 the Playstation 11 failed. After numerous calls to Playstation 11's technical staff I was told the unit had to be returned to them to be fixed,at a cost to me of $65.00!!! This is ridiculous!!! After spending over $170.00 for a playing unit, plus the expense of the playstation games ,I told them there was no way I would have the thing repaired at that cost. Imagine using the machine for one year then paying 65.00 to have it fixed after only one year of off and on use. I take it that Sony expects you to use their machine at a cost of $65.00 a year. Absurd. I will never buy a playstation II product again since I have better ways to spend my hard earned money."
3,Where is my HDD port?,What i want to know is whatis sony thinking? I mean they are trying to push the HDD and then they come out with their new Ps2 and it can't even us a HDD. WHAT ABOUT THE FFXI AND SOCOM FANS!!!
1,"A disgrace! Sony, I'm going to get you for this..","..for ruining Sega's system competition! I may be getting your PS3, but I'm never getting your PS2! You decided to put Dreamcast out of business, eh? Well, you're a DISGRACE! All idiots! For those of you who fell sorry for Sega for this, turn your back against the PS2!"
1,"PS2 gave me carpal tunnel syndrome, Stay Away !","I unwittingly bought a PS2, not knowing that I'd get a god awfull small game controller. I used it for a month and now I can't hardly move my hands or my fingers. Don't buy Playstation 2. They've ruined my future. I'm writing this review right now by using a voice typing program that Microsoft published especially for people who've ended up in my poor situation."
4,Constantin and his Playstation 2,"Constantin my son, has learnt all sort of sports using his Playstation 2: ice hockey, for example! Consider that we live in South America, in a tropical country like Venezuela, where the chances for a snowfall are very very scarse! I consider that video games give our children tools that improve their decision making skills, paralel thinking and develop their creativity and flexibility."
1,ps2(new design) over priced!,"People are selling new PS2 over priced!!!! It only cost $150 in the store, and it's over $200 online!!!! What are you people smoking!!!!!!!?Note: No one is going to buy ps2 for over $200, only dumb people would buy for over $200, smart people would only buy for $150, you people will never make buisness like this."
2,Why is all I ask,"Sony did just fine with original PS2. Sure its graphics aren't nearly as good as Xbox, or have a hard drive like the Xbox, but it has way more games, and allot of them are really fun. Instead of optimizing the HDD, Sony has cut it out. It made the system quiter, but reduced the size of the fan-which equalls more disk errors and game freezes and it happens faster than ever. This system is completely pointless and insufficient compared to the original PS2. I love Playstation, but I cant give this system praise like all the other PS2 fans out there because it was made by Sony. Here is how it is-Xbox is a much better system, PS2 has many more fun games to play. Put the two together and it would be impressive at least. I suggest anyone looking to buy the new PStwo to spend the extra $40 and get the original, or an Xbox. If you want to buy a present for your kids, this flimsy toy thing will be smashed within a month, waste of money and time."
5,Great system,"I purchased this system for my 6 year old for Christmas, and we love playing it. We have not had any overheating problems and we have played for hours. We don't have any older games, but the ones we do have work fine."
1,Is this a fluke?,"We had the PS but eventually we got disk reader error, checked out the informational boards, nothing worked.This PS2 Slim looked intriguing so we replaced our old outdated one with this one June 16th - It is now July 29th and we are now back to disc reader error again - sheesh This time the drive doesn't even turn. This is a 150 dollar item...I'm realistic how long electronics work but this new design does not make me happy. Nor-- that my only recourse is to return the thing on my own to manufacturer. Disclaimer: This doesn't apply to Amazon since I purchased this product locally."
3,save and save often,"the slim version of the ps2 is a cute little system, easer to pack away when you are moving from place to place. however there is one flaw, it has no fan and will frequently turn itself off for no apperent reason. some time it over heats, sometimes it just decides it really doesn't want to play that movie. while i would recomend getting a ps2 i would look for its bulkier cousin, for while its bulky it has not heating problems, and doesn't have a mind of its own"
5,Exactly what I wanted,I had some denim yarn and I really wanted to use it. This was exactly what I was looking for. I hope that I can make some of the other sweaters in the book as well as the one I am working on right now.
2,Velcro? Secure? Not My Kid!,It appears from the image that the child security (buckle??) is in the back but it is velcro. Just how secure can that be with your smart toddler?
5,A creative necessity,"One of the most inspiring and liberating concepts I've ever come across. Being a graphic designer and one who enjoys painting, ceramics, beading and other crafts, The Creative Fire has stoked the embers of my soul into a blazing inferno. I would recommend these audio CD's to anyone with a creative flair or anyone who wishes to discover the artist within. (review by Clarissa Witten)"
4,The Creative Visualization Workbook,"The book is designed to accompany Shakti Gawain's book, The Creative Visualization. The workbook provides some effective techniques to practice on writing affirmations. I particularly like the pink bubble technique. Recommend this book, but would suggest reading the book The Creative Visualization first."
1,used or refilled,the product came with a used box and the toner was either used or refill. printed out black spot on paper. and need to bought a different one locally works fine. its not my printer's problem.
4,FYI to previouse reviewer,"a California King is more of a rectangular shape and slightly longer than a King which is basically square. Thus the reason your sheets don't fit. You have to buy a California King size sheet, if you have a California King size bed."
4,they're okay,"I'm pretty happy with my order, the sheets are soft, but not as soft as I had hoped they would be. But for the price I'm satisfied. They are really pretty and I love the color."
5,Will Read Again,"This one will not go in the Goodwill basket. I was intrigued to read about Poland in the Napleon days. A great culture, similiar to England but not as stuffy. Some of the characters may have been a bit exaggerated but all in all a good asortment. The story was gripping, the situations nicely woven together, and the comfort of knowing there is a sequel."
4,Compelling and Informative........,"I love reading epics of this nature with strong, decisive women. The writer's quest was especially interesting. The book was written with the help of the diary the Countess Anna kept and it was translated by a man who had the same name as her lover. Coming into the authors hands some 30 years ago in California while he was trying to learn how to be a screenwriter is especially interesting to me. When his friend gave him the diary, he planned to give it back as soon as he could because he didn't want to read ""an old Polish lady's diary"". Imagine thinking of Anna as an old Polish lady! Of course, the more he read, the more entranced he became, I'm sure. He had to do tons of reseach to fill in the gaps, but he stated that the dramatic parts in the book that seemed unbelievable were straight from the diary. And, ""yes, Zofia, was as bad as all that"" he said."
3,"A good story, lame writing....","This book kept me up, the story line is very intense...but the writing is horrible. I literally groaned when I read the line ""I swear by the white eagle I will love you always"". If I hadn't known this was an actual account I would have sworn this was a very cheap melodrama. Nonetheless...I was hooked and probably will read the sequel."
5,Classic adventurous romance!,"""Push Not the River"" was every bit as thrilling and romantic as classic novels such as ""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""Jane Eyre."" It engrossed me from start to finish and left me wanting to know more about Anna's diary and life. In short, I thought the book was great and am very glad to be adding it to my personal library."
2,"Great Story, Terrible Writing","This book very much wanted to be Gone With the Wind, I think.It helped to know the story was based on the actual diary a Polish countess -- especially when reading the quoted passages from her cousin's diary, as I never would have believed them otherwise. So lurid!The story itself is very exciting and tense, but the writing simply isn't up to the story. It is a shame. i think it could have been a great historical novel/romance/thriller in the hands of the right author. Instead it seems limp and tepid, filled with silly turns of phase and under-descriptive language."
5,"Peter, thanks for the inspiration!","I have always enjoyed Peter's books and articles. This booked has helped us pick hikes all over the world. BTW, Although we enjoyed doing Buckskin Gultch, it has become too much of a toilet in places. People, please, pack out ""everything""!"
4,A Strange Trip Into The Weird & Twisted,"Zombie Cult Massacre is one wild flick. It takes the viewer on a wild romp though the weird. This movie has it all, a weird religious cult, bikers, women, zombies, a mad doctor and even the devil himself."
4,Perfect guitar for a toddler,"This is the perfect guitar for a toddler (I gave it to my son for his third birthday). He absolutely loves it. This is not a toy. It is a musical instrument. That is probably the most valuable lesson for a toddler, the difference between toy and instrument.Good: Nylon Strings are easy on little fingers (a 3 year old isn't going to be using the picks). Size is perfect for little hands and fingers. The price is perfect. While it's not a toy, accidents can happen, and if it happens to a $35 instrument, much better than a $60 or $70.Bad: Tuning - Keeping this instrument tuned is difficult, and nearly impossible. That's not the point though. If your child is good enough to keep a tune, then you really need something else."
4,OK,"It is really a small guitar for kids. I bought it for myself but obviously by mistake. However, it is not like a toy but a real instrument. Its low volume may be both a good and bad thing. If you buy it for a small kid, I recommend it. If you buy for a teenager, well...."
4,3 year-old loves it,"I am very pleased with this guitar and so is my 3 year-old daughter. As noted by other reviewers, this is not a performance guitar, but I have found it to be well worth the $40 I spent for it - and it helps distract my daughter from always wanting to play with my guitar. Given the quality of the furnished nylon strings, it is difficult to keep in tune for extended periods of time, which may prove to be frustrating for anyone not familiar with tuning a guitar. However, I have been able to keep it close enough to tuned for my daughter to start learning the basics. The size is perfect for her and I purchased an inexpensive strap ($5) and installed strap buttons ($7) so she can stand for her ""performances."" If your child shows some interest in music and you are looking for a guitar to test the waters, I would recommend this. If your child already has some playing ability and you are looking for a ""longer-term, quality"" guitar, don't expect to find much at the $40 price point."
1,THIS SUCKS,"I used to love this band in the early 90's, (Swain's, Choice, etc.). What happened? This is one of those cd's that makes you embarrassed when you listen to it. They used to make original music. This is silly. It seems Jeff Ott's first concern is his lyrics and then he builds a song around them--and it doesn't work. This is worse than Lucky which also sucked. I can believe I paid (...) bucks to listen to this negative creep rant about needles and child abuse for another album. No thanks."
4,Nice!!,"The bag is very nice, the only thing I would change on it would be to have the bottom of the bag about 6-8 inches wider. This is a good buy."
3,A gave it three stars... and that's being kind,"Well, you MIGHT like it if you are a three year old that has recently suffered a head injury. The only reason I even rented this video was because my favorite actor, Tim Curry, was in this. And he didn't even look all that great, Curry should never grease down his hair. This movie is the stupidest thing you will ever see if you dare to watch it. And if you have any questions or comments on my review please e-mail."
2,"Ah, what could have been....","This is one of those movies that's really hard for me to rate. Much of what has been said in earlier reviews is accurate; the slapstick humor, almost nonexistent script, and obvious CGI really detract from the movie. In fact, this was a pilot for the Fox Family channel's ""New Addams Family"" TV series, and that tells you most of what you need to know about this movie.What's heartbreaking is that, as appallingly bad as this movie was, the few bright spots are REALLY bright. Tim Curry as Gomez? Brilliant! Daryl Hannah as Morticia? I had my doubts, but she really made it work. Ray Walston as the head of the single-D Adams clan? I like it!The real tragedy of this movie is that, if it had been made along the same lines as the first two movies, I firmly believe it could have been a worthy successor and we might have seen more to the franchise."
2,Geoff & Melinda Adams are the best part,"All things aside my favorite parts were always back at the addams house...where Geoff ""Rodger Halston "" & Melinda ""Heidi Lennhart"" try to live though the night. It was their performances that i enjoyed the most...The rest was average at best..."
1,DUMB WERID MOVIE,THIS MOVIE WAS JUST DUMB NOTHING LIKE THE FIRST TWO THIS HAD NO HUMUR IS WAS JUST DUMUB IT WAS BORING THE PLOT DID NOT MAKE SENSE ATT ALL WENDAY AND PUGLEY WAT THEY DID IN THIS MADE NO SENSE THE ADDAMS FAMILY ACCTED SUPID IN THIS ONE FESTER WENT AROUND ACCTEING LIKE HAD TO THE BATEROOM A ALOT IN THIS TIM CURY DID NOT PLAY THE PART FOR GOMEZ GOOD AT ALL WHY DID THEY HAVE TO PUT A KILLER DOG THAT WAS NOT EVEN FUUNY THEY DREESED TO GLOTHIC LOOKING IN THIS THIS IS JUST NOT A GOOD MOVIE DONT SEE IT I HOPE WHEN THEY MAKE A NOTHER ADDAMS FAMILY MOVIE THEY MAKE IT GOOD LIKE THEY FIRST TWO AND PUT EFERT IN TO IT AND THEY PUT ANJELICA HUSTON IN IT.
3,Seemed like it would've been a good toy...,"My dog figured out how to get the rings off, and as he was in the process had a great time, squeaking the rings, bone, etc. I went in the other room for a minute, and he proudly brings me the bare bone- destuffed and completely destroyed. I was hoping that wouldn't happen, he's not normally too destructive with stuffed toys (at least right away) but something tempted him to just rip it open, which he did easily. On the upside, he still has fun with the rings that are left."
2,Cute Toy but Not Chew Proof,"After purchasing the Kyjen 6 squeaker snake from PetsMart and realizing that it was a great toy I quickly looked up Kyjen online and found/purchased several other toys. One of which was the large intellibone puzzle. The website never claimed that this toy was chew resistant and I should have known better but my dog likes puzzles so I thought this would be a great toy for her. I have an American Bulldog/Chow mix with razor sharp teeth at the peak of her puppy chewing stage. I quickly realized that she was going to destroy this toy within a day so I took it away from her after a half an hour of play time. On a positive note, she loved this toy until I took it away from her. She didn't quite get the concept of pulling the rings off of the bone within the half an hour she played with it but she had fun playing anyway. Unfortunately she got a hold of the puzzle after I took it away from her and chewed it up completely."
1,So disappointed,"I had been waiting a long time to get one of these DVDs of the old Dean Martin show. I was a big fan of both Dean and the show. But if these were the highlights, maybe my memory exagerrates how much I enjoyed the show. Of the approximately 45 minutes, maybe 10 minutes were good. At least this saves me buying the rest of the series."
4,Left me wanting more,"I agree somewhat with the previous reviewer with the exception that I do not think the parts of the book dealing with Euro racing were uninteresting or poorly written. It's just that those stories have all been told before, while the story of the writer's own experiences as he attempts to upgrade from Cat IV was fresh and even more interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and the writing style and I hope the author will write more."
5,Out of the Mouths of Teenagers,"This book contains 60 devotions written by teenagers. I have two teenagers, and we read them as family devotions around the dinner table. The devotions are short (but not too short), cover contemporary issues of interest to teenagers, and are written in language that teenagers can understand. The book is aimed at high school students and is equally good for both sexes. The book is published by the Lutheran Church, Missouri Synod, but the devotions cover issues of Christian living rather than doctrine and are good for all denominations. (I am a Presbyterian minister's daughter who attended a Reformed Church college and married into the Lutheran Church, so I can say that with confidence.)"
3,PRETTY GOOD FOR A GREATEST HITS CD,"Pretty evenly spead out between the Holy Diver through Dream Evil Era, which covers 12-13 tracks. A good investment for casual fans,"
5,Unabashed Love for DIO!,"Tired of boring music that makes you yearn for the sweet caress of a nailgun after just a few listens? Like a good dose of the magical and mystical (unicorns, trolls, shadows, incomprehensible evil, etc.) with amazing hooks and Satan-rising riffs in your rock? Want all this from a 60-inch, gap-toothed arachnophobe?Then this is your album, brother! When there's Dio, ya know it never brings me down!!"
4,First in line...,"A very serviceable and carefully put together compilation paying the right tribute to the personification of rock'n'roll:Ronnie Dio.The songs flow excellently,showcasing metal as not just entertainment,but legitimate art.An essential item,especially for those who are getting their first taste of the mighty dwarf..."
5,Great for Smart Dogs!,"My 10 month old Australian Shepherd loves this toy! We throw all the squirrels into it, and he proceeds to empty it and run around with the log. This is a great toy for intelligent dogs who love to solve puzzles. We didn't show him at all how to do it. He caught on immediately! I bought one for my Grandfather's 14 month old Standard poodle as well! Great Toy, Worth every penny!"
3,squirrels in a tree stump,"Squirrells did not last one day, did not expect them to. I liked the idea of a puzzle and it works great for our dog. I stuff the tree stumps with other dog toys and sometimes a treat wedged in. It keeps him occupied for a long time. I do not leave the tree stump available for chewing any length of time."
4,She loves the Squirels...,"Thought this would be a great toy for my dog but she takes the squiels out and hides them around the house. She doesn't really play with the other part buts it's funny finding a squirel in the shoe closet, pantry or under your pillow! I would recommend it to others."
3,somewhat disappointed,"the squirrels seem to be holding up pretty well, but my 4 month old great dane tore open the trunk within the first few days. it is possible that he is just too young for this toy - instead of searching for the squirrels in the trunk, he would just grab it and sling them out...hilarious but destructive. i guess i will patch it up and hide it until he is older."
1,Lasted less than 5 minutes,My shepherd ripped apart squirrels within first few minutes. Don't understand how this would not happen with any lorge dog. Very disappointed.
2,OK toy...,"I bought this toy reading the reviews and thought it could be good mental exercise for my GSD puppy but he figured it out within 3 seconds and the only use of this toy is now for chewing....Although my dog loves the cute squirrels, they are poorly made.The squeakers broke in two days.. I wouldn't suggest this toy for German shepherds.."
2,crazy making,"I hate the squeakers in this toy. It encourages destructiveness in my hunting dog. I'm sure it's fine for some dogs, but take this as a warning if your dog ""kills"" squeakers."
1,Cute but destroyed in 6 hours by 5 mini schnauzers,"Fuzzy hair bitten off, legs and squeeker removed from each squirrel. They're dead, toy is no fun anymore. Not tough enough for mini schnauzers.Maybe good for a tea-cut sized dog."
