2,Disgusting,"The content and acting were surprising bad. I remember these times, but this seem to protray the worst side of this world. Not light entertainment."
2,NOT WORTH THE EXPENSE,NOT WORTH THE EXPENSE. NOT MUCH OF A STORY. HARD TO FOLLOW. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.VERY DOLL.
1,NOT GOOD AT ALL!,"Tawdry, no story movie. Low life Americans doing nothing with their lives. Cheap thrills without a story line--no character development."
3,it was ok,I really thought this movie could have been better. Not what I expected. I really enjoyed Channing Tatum's dance moves though.
1,This movie was terrible,"This movie had no plot at all, it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen and if it didn't have some name actors it would never have even been watched. The trailers were misleading as it looked like a fun movie and it was not!"
3,"Extras on Blu Ray, not on DVD","I enjoyed the movie a lot. But, I just came back from the store without buying anything...it appears that there are more extras on the DVD(especially deleted scenes on the Blu Ray than the DVD). If so, I am not happy. Can anyone speak to this point. I assune I am the first one to notice it because the film was just released today.I am a big fan of the film, which I saw twice...once in the Castro Theater in SF."
4,Just Dance,"I wasn't sure about a movie about male strippers but Channing Tatum sure can dance. Some of the movie was a bit corny and I have to say that some of the other dancers were pretty darn bad, but Channing and Matthew really put on a show."
3,bad movie,"Its a pretty bad movie,but its all worth suffering through it if you enjoy Channing Tatum and his dancing skills."
3,bought it as a joke,"dancing is awesome,story line laughable.good for a girls nite out.get some riends together and have a party,or make your man learn how to dance"
2,was not much of a story,dancing wasn't all that and didn't care for actors. Story really was very lame. Just disappointing I think to me.
1,Magic Mike,The worst movie ever. The best thing about the movie was the dancing. The story line was awful because there wasn't one.
2,Only reason I kept watching is that Channing Tatum is so cute.,"Did not like the movie. Waaaay to nasty for me. But Channing is adorable.Don't know why he picked this movie to star in. Nasty movie!!And, Matthew McCognahy (spell?) was really slimey.... Lordy, he was slimey!"
3,no extended scenes,the movie is ok...just ok..not horrible but nothing special at all..i wish they would have made it clear that the full dances are not on the dvd but the blu-ray...its only $14 so its not that much of a waste but to buy the dvd and get nothing more than just a movie i've already seen and a bunch of interviews that i couldn't care less about is just a bunch of bull....not even any bloopers and i know there was plenty of those..its a male stripper movie after all i can imagine the crazy stuff that happened on set
2,shallow,Kinda depressing and the story line was not well developed. I like Tatum but this didn't do his career any favors.
2,not that good,the handsome friend of the brother falls for the ugly sister. i mean really unattractive and not a body on her either.... come on they could have had a pretty sister. the plot was stupid
4,magic mike,cool movie i would recommend it to freinds funny had a blast watching it. a movie that ladies will love :)
5,Hot Stuff,"Gotta love Chatum Tanning and the hot male bods, but would have loved to see more. A fun movie to watch with the girls."
3,it's not a so bad movie!,"the only good thing about this movie is tatum and pettyfer,also the dancing! the storyline is terrible!that is all i can say about this movie!"
3,Ok,Movie was ok. I don't know what else to say about the movie except that it was just ok. Won't watch it a second time.
3,Magic Mike,Magic Mike - I expected more. I was thrilled with Channing Tatum however his acting is better than this movie portrayed. And I have to say I was very disappointed with Matt McConahay (sp?) who is my all time FAVORITE actor!
2,A bit of disappointment,"The cast looked good, but the seedy storyline left me not wanting more. Sorry; I was really hoping for something better."
2,It wasn't good.,"My wife rented the movie. She thought the story wasn't good, the acting wasn't good but she enjoyed the dancing."
2,Magic Mike,"Sorry I paid to watch this movie...what a disappointment Matthew was , why would he do this movie, it was way beneath his talent.What a cheesey role"
2,Blech,"Two things I liked, hard bodies and the dancing. Couldn't find anything to care about in the characters, love story sucked, the ""kid"" needed to be B#*&C slapped. And there wasn't enough of the hard bodies. Oh and I hated Matt Mc playing such a slime ball!"
3,Interesting...,"But I felt like the storyline was incomplete. The movie started out fun and funny, but halfway through it died down a bit too much for me. I like it, yet I don't love it."
2,Disappointing!,Not enough story line. Channing Tatum was good dancer though. He always has been.I have nothing more to say.
1,No Extended Scenes,Did not have any extended scenes which had been advertised and was the only reason I purchased it in the first place.
3,Meh,There should have been more dance scenes. But the ones that were in it was spectacular. But the story line needed a bigger boost.
2,Pretty embarrassing,"I had a girl's night in with a friend, so we thought we'd give in and watch this. Poor acting, poor storyline... so we thought if all else was bad, maybe the half naked guys and dancing would be okay? Nope. I still have no idea what half the women in America are going wild over! It just didn't work out for this movie."
3,Bad story,"It was stupid. He was half naked and that was great, but story plot sucked. The ending was beyond horrible. It disappointed me."
2,Malaise Mike,"Slow moving, not interesting (which is hard to do when semi or complete nudity is the norm). I've seen documentaries on strippers (where there is no plot or story at all), which were much more engaging than this movie. The actors phoned in their performances and the director apparently just glued the transcripts together."
5,Sexy!!,Great performances! Great actors! Lots of sexy dances!! Handsome guys! Great bodies! It's just great for having a good time with friends! Just sexiness all over!
2,GREAT BODIES....,"...bad movie. Oh, and not enough Matt Bomer! This was a terrible movie. The only redeeming quality was the male bodies and Channing's dancing. The rest was trash."
2,Magic Mike - Meh,"They should have written the script AND THEN added the stripping aspect. Instead the focus is on the stripping aspect and the story is an afterthought - like, oh yeah, we need to write dialogue for these people. And I heartily agree with those who say this is a re-heated Flashdance remake.That being said, Channing Tatum is not to be missed and can dance for me anytime. OMFG."
3,The best from Channing Tatum yet,"Obviously, this is not going to win an Oscar, but I definitely found it entertaining and worth the rental fee. There has been a lot of criticism of the acting, but I have to say this was the best I have seen from Channing Tatum. I love his movies because, let's be honest, he is nice to look at, but I have never felt he was a great actor. In this movie, I saw a talent from him that I never saw before. Channing aside, I really enjoyed this movie. It's not very often that there are practically naked men all through a movie. :) Also, how often are we going to see Matthew McConaughey walking around in a black thong with tassels."
1,"If you like trash, this is right up your alley....","Tragically, my teenage granddaughter and my daughter chose this movie to watch for girls night out. Within 5 minutes, grandmother was mortified. Daughter and granddaughter were both embarrassed. How very sad that this is what is given to the younger generations as entertainment. Worst $3.99 I have ever spent."
1,Let down,Very Dark lighting--over rated--glad I didn't waste my money going to the theater--Not worth the $1.99 special--don't waste your money
2,Um,"I've heard a LOT about this movie, both positive and negative. And to be frank I expected more. However, I found this movie to be rather dull. It should have focused more on humor and stripping, the movie started out funny and I liked it, but it quickly deteriorated and failed to live up to the positive hype. Eh."
1,Acting?,The only thing good about this movie is Channing Tatum and Olivia Munn. The rest of the acting was pathetic. If you want to call it acting when all you do is walk around with your mouth hanging open and talking like a retard then Matthew McConaughey should get an award. He was awful. The dancing was pitiful. Terrible moive dont waste your money. Channing does have a beautiful butt!
4,Hard Bodies,"Big fan of Channing Tatum and Alex Pettyfer and as usual they didn't disappoint. The choreography was good, and Matt McConaughey held his own. Keep up the good work Steve Soderbergh!"
1,Horribly bad,If there was less than 1 star that would be my vote. Good dancing by Tatum - horrible story- falls in with Showgirls bad!
2,"Good dancing, but weak characters and story","My fiancee convinced me to rent this film with her, and we both ended up with a similar impression of this film.Basically the film is about a group of male strippers who are attempting to move up into the ""big time."" One of the most successful members of the team, however, is more interested in trying to grow up and move along. In the meantime, he is bringing along ""The Kid,"" as a new member of the show.Overall, the dancing and acting is quite good. Channing Tatum in particular shines in the dancing scenes.However, the story/character development is very minimal (non-existent for most of the cast). Very little time is spent outside of the club scenes, and when you see the daily life of Mike or the Kid, you catch only a glimpse.Ultimately, you may enjoy some of the dancing and club scenes, but you will leave the film feeling rather unfulfilled."
4,Shure PG48,"Great low cost mic for practice, looping or adhoc recording. On/off switch is nice backup for loop switching when you've got a hand free."
5,"Yes, finally","I use a 25 year old Peavy amp.I also used a crummy mic that came with a cheap-o Karokee machine.Today I knocked my socks off... the sound the clarity the volume,unmatched for the buck."
2,If you are seeking DIY instructions- pass on this one,"As the title implies, this book is intended for people seeking an overview of what home automation, networking, X10, security, a/v distibution. It is very comprehensive so kudos there.However, if you are after more detailed instructions on how to hook something up, really plan & design your systems or prewire you new construction this book does not get that deep.I suppose was hoping for more real examples, diagrams and do it yourself instruction. I'm trying to learn in order to avoid paying someone $2000 to install $200 worth of wire and outlets in my house (especially regarding X10 which is really cool). So I returned this book and am consdiering one called ""Automated Home Control"" by Bucceri. Haven't found it on Amazon yet, but it's on homcontrols.com and smarthomeusa.com"
1,I'm not that dumb after all,"This is the first 'dummies' book I've ever read. You can read the book from ""start to finish"" (as I did) or jump around the chapters that may interest you. While it did provide some interesting information which certainly helped me, it also provided page after page of pointless repetition. I'm wondering who the publishers think their market might be, it's not so much for 'dummies' but more for the 'utterly stupid' who probably wouldn't be reading the book in the first place.My advice is just Google something like ""Cabling for Smart Homes"" or ""Wiring for Smart homes"" and you'll get all the info you need without having to suffer wading through a lot of the tripe found in this publication."
5,INTRIGUING AND INTELLINGENTLY WRITTEN,"I just finished reading this book and I am totally fascinated by it. Before reading this book I knew nothing about dreams and what they meant, nor had I ever had any interest in finding out. This book covers in-depth all of the questions, I could ever think about asking. It clearly explains the traditional meanings of over 10,000 dreams. This author really did his research by revealing what the subconscious mind does when it goes to work. The book also explains how our dreams can help us conquer phobias and overcome personal problems. I found all of the information contained in this book very interesting."
3,"10,000 dreams","This book is harder to find what your looking for. There are some good explanations for some, and then some don't have much. It is OK."
5,Heyday - Tim Hart & Maddy Prior,"This is an excellent 2 CD set of traditional songs from the British Isles played and sung by 2 of my favorite artists. I like that it is entirely acoustic, the arrangements and the songs that they have included are great. It's very rare to find such a gem as this."
4,"The usual wonderful Le Creuset quality, but HEAVIER than most","A great pan, as usual with Le Creuset, but VERY HEAVY. Our household is used to Le Creuset (the 7-quart round is probably our most-used size), but this 5-quart and it's lid are deemed extraordinarily heavy. We use it, and we're glad to have it, but wouldn't recommend it for weaklings."
2,Lacked Continuity,"Viewed this film via Amazon Rentals. Although I appreciate a good western, I did not particularly care for the style of the way it was presented. The jumping around from one scenario to another was annoying. That's just my opinion."
3,Good CD,"I'm not a P&H; fan, in fact I just bought this CD for reunited so I could play it an annoy my buddy. However upon listening to it, hey it's good music. I'm glad I bought it.The Paulos"
5,Japanese Motifs,So far the only Ra-Mon book that I have found with my family Crest. For me it is worth the money.
2,Poor examples,"This book uses terrible examples to try and explain the concept of classes etc. For a dummies book, it's poorly written and I wouldn't expect it to appeal to beginners. Now sits on my bookshelf or doubles as a coaster for tea and coffee. Even worse the examples are almost the same as those from 'Learn Java Now' from the same author."
1,Worst Dummy book ever...now I'm the dummy,don't buy this book UNLESS you already know C. I bought this book because most Dummy books assume NO knowledge in the subject whatsoever. Buyers beware!
1,The worst programming book I've read,"This book is horrible. Its EXTREMELY confusing, goes through everything very fast, and assumes that you know a lot of things, which is bad enough by itself, but he doesn't even explain that you need to know some of the things. DO NOT buy this book. Dan Gookins book, C For Dummies, is a great book, if your going to buy a C/C++ book, buy that book."
1,This one actually lives up to its name,"Unfortunately, ""C++ for Dummies"" is aimed towards programmers that already have a good handle on the ""C"" language. How in the world the author rationalized making this part of the ""for Dummies"" series is beyond me. Even if you do know C, this is a bad book. I read the back cover before purchasing this text, and there is one very vague indication of it being written for people that have a background in another language. I find that very deceptive. A big disappointment. I wish I had found Amazon before I bought these crappy books..."
2,"DO NOT buy becuase it's a ""Dummies""","I have been a reader of the dummies series for years, starting with the famous ""DOS for Dummies"" book. Every single Dummies book I have read was excellent until I reached this book. This book assumes not only that you know 'C' language, but that you are good at it. This book reads more like a college textbook than a ""dummies"" book. There are many better C++ books out there. If you know C, it is possible to learn C++ (hence the 2 stars)Mike"
1,waste of money!,"If you have conquered the world of C, this is NOT the place to start with c++. he does barely any examples, and the ones he does are just tidbits of the code. he is obsessed with classes, which isnt a good thing. he doesnt explain how anything works, he just says ""ill explain it later"" which he never does. THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE! i am very sorry i bought it"
2,Not very helpful,I purchased this book for additional assistance in my learning of C++ while taking it in college. I was very disappointed that it took the ridiculous approach of assuming I already knew C language. Duh! Talk about dummies
4,"Beautiful picture book, recipes not very accurate","it is a cook book, so you expect to make good use of the recipes. I am Brazilian and I assure that many recipes are different of the ""traditional way of doing"" or have different ingredients. Besides, it doesn't cover the very typical menu, instead has some recipes that don't tell much about what would be a Brazilian taste. Above all, still a great book very well illustrated."
4,Is water capable of extinghuishing the Middle East fire?,Hydrology is an aspect central to Arab - Israely conflict. This is one thing commonly ignored by Peace and Conflict scholars. The author suggests a valuable reminder of the water determinant in the political equation of the lengthy Middle East conflict. The book is highky actual in these days due to Israel goverment's effort to achieve peace deals with it's neighbours.
2,Incomplete,This book is ONLY good if you want a jest of what ASP is about. But forget it if you are going into heavy ASP programming. It skims through the important to ASP and it leaves out many essential details. Even if you are beggining ASP it is worth getting a more complete book.
3,Good for starters but TOO many errors,"If you are not familiar with ASP at all, this book might helpful to you. The best part of the book is it cover lots of things about ASP. Starting from writing a simple message on screen, up to creating an online store.But all the code samples full with typos and errors. And after you finish half of the book, you are starting to code your own way.Writer underestimates SQL language. He even says ""UGLY SQL Code"" and he types 15 lines of code, which you can accomplish same thing with 3-4 lines of SQL code, if you can create tables, choose column types and attributes wisely.I bought this book, I am not fully satisfied but I am not dissapointed either.My recommendation is, if you wanna buy this book don't pay for new one, buy a used one instead. Like me :)"
4,This soundtrack is a classic!,"Some of the songs on the track aren't incredibly popular, but they are gems. ""PILLOW""- is definitely the BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM"
3,Cool Idea!,"I think this is a great idea. Children get to make the book themselves. The stickers are large, easy to peel off, and each has a fact to help the child put it where it belongs. The pages on this book are packed with facts about the animals. The only problem is that the outline of the sticker on the page and the acutal outline of the sticker don't quite match. This book is great for car trips or for any time children need something educational to do."
3,I'll give it a 3 for honest content,"Ok,maybe a 3.5 but I wouldn't go higher than that. There are two good things to say about this movie. 1. You are surprised - at least I was. 2. Michael Nyqvist looks really, really good (Then again, when has he looked bad?) He is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise very dark film.There are three things that caused the low rating. 1. You really, really have to pay attention to what is happening, otherwise it's easy to get lost. 2. Michael is on screen for about 3 minutes in the entire flick. 3. The subject matter deals with both incest and suicide - so if you are sensitive to these, think twice.For a collector, it's a good movie to add to your collection. For entertainment? Not really."
2,don't waste your money,"If you're considering this movie i'm going to save you some time, it's crap. However cheap it is just put your money in your pocket and reverse it. It's a rip off of a few other movies with the same plot, but those were better written and acted."
1,Too Small!!!,"You can get a 10 gallon for a little over a dollar more OR get a 5 gallon for less then half the price at certain stores.Please, PLEASE give your betta at least a gallon.I've used this product before and it is a decent product but I'm no longer ignorant of a bettas needs. I URGE you to PLEASE get a bigger tank. Though if you want this for a temporary hospital tank it MIGHT work but you'd want a heated tank for sick bettas."
2,dont care for it,"Ok i have one just like this 1 but mine is a red color, we bought it at a pet store but my Betta dont seem to like it & he has been in it for about 5 or 6 months now & he seems sad i think cause there is to much space or to much water but no where for him to hide. you can put plants in it but you cant fit a hide away home for your Betta. i have one & if i was you i would not spend the money on this tank kit."
2,"Pretty, but REALLY needs a cover.","This little tank looked very nice on my counter top. I did notice that the water became dirty/cloudy very quickly, requiring it to be cleaned pretty often. It wasn't difficult to clean though, and my betta always seemed to enjoy exploring the ""new"" surroundings afterward.Most importantly though, BE SURE TO PUT SOME TYPE OF COVER OVER THE OPENING ON THE TOP - I forgot to leave the makeshift cover on one day while I was at work, and my little buddy Alpha tried to make a break for it.Suffice to say, he didn't make it very far."
5,"Until there is a better term, it's a great book anyway","Until there is a better term for Attention Deficit, that's the name kids have to deal with. This is a great book anyway because the child uses his ""problem of paying too close attention to minute details"" to find his way out of the woods in order to rescue his dad. He is the hero and not a problem child as such. We learn some about his problems and some solutions but this well written story puts us in his shoes in a very understanding and kind way. This reminds me of a new book, Whoa Wiggle-worm by Betsy B. Lee. It discusses kind and unkind nicknames in an entertaining story showing a child learning self-control. A diagnosis is not given. The child might not be ADD or ADHD. The label is beside the point. I hope both books are in print for a very long time."
1,My son hated it.,It's just not that great. Borrow it at a library and see what you think before purchasing.
5,Great coffee maker,"We are very happy with the performance of this coffee maker. I thought I would miss the ""automatic"" function of my previous coffee makers, but it does make coffee in three minutes."
1,Huge disappointment.,"This was supposed to be my wife's big Xmas surprise; she'd always wanted a Bunn.Over the past year, it's been a disappointment. The manual says you have to brew at least 4 cups. Nope. The machine wouldn't work after a while. A call to the (friendly) customer service at Bunn, and I learned you really have to brew at least 6 cups at a time, or the water eventually runs too low. My wife's the only coffee drinker at home, so we waste a lot of coffee.And the machine has to stay on the whole time. The power switch is on the side near the base, easily bumped by mistake. It's no fun getting up in the a.m. and finding that your coffee pot's off by accident, and now you have to go through a rigmarole and wait half an hour to get your coffee.I'm going to buy her a plain old Krupp drip machine for half the price. It won't get the water as hot, it won't make coffee as well, but it will WORK. Maybe the more expensive Bunn models work well, but avoid this one."
5,BEST COFFEE POT I'VE EVER OWNED!,"I've gone through many coffeemakers. The Bunn was a replacement for my Krups (which I loved) because I broke the carafe and it wasn't worth buying a replacement. I decided to 'bite the bullet' and pay the extra cost for a Bunn. Boy, I'm not dissappointed. The coffee tastes wonderful, and it makes a full pot in less than 3 minutes. If it lasts as long as I've heard, it will end up being a bargain in the long run. The replacement carafes are $10.00 which is very reasonable. I highly recommend this Bunn."
2,Bunn coffee pot,"This coffee pot drips - I've decalcified, delimed, de-everything and it still drips - very disappointed in this product. The only thing it does do is make a quick cup of coffee. I probably should have given it only one star."
4,A Different And Delightful Book,"I read ""Primrose Past"" in one continuous session. The characters grow as the story flows.""Primrose Past"", beautifully bound, not only provides reading pleasure but also a vivid description of the lifestyles, customs, and traditions of l800 England. A diary, lost for over a century, opens doors to the England of years gone by and the deepest secrets of the girl who wrote it. A truly unique and revealing book."
5,One of a Kind - Classic Entertainment at its Best,"This DVD is absolutely fantastic! I have been a Bob Hope fan since the early years and this DVD series reunites the old memories. I'm pretty sure I laugh more now than I did when I was a little kid. Jackie Gleason's comical performances combined with the musical stylings of Frank Sinatra make for truly engaging entertainment. In fact, my children have even become fans of the DVDs."
1,Tendentious hatemongering,"The author seems to have done much research, but he also seems to have fallen into the deductive trap of ""after the fact, therefore because of the fact"". That Jews are successful in many fields of endeavor does not mean that they have arranged with each other to succeed for the purpose of advancing ""Jewish interests"".Someone who disliked, for example, men of Anglo-Saxon origin or members of any of several other groups, could easily find source material to make a much stronger case that people of some other group have networked with each other in order to advance various philosophies and institutions which benefit their interests.Accordingly, I cannot help but wonder why the author has picked out--picked on--the Jews. Could it be because Jews have traditionally been the scapegoats for whom the discontented blame almost every intellectual idea or social or political philosophy with which they disagree?"
4,A groundbreaker in the field of educational sociology.,"In 1932, Willard Waller produced a remarkable book which examined the sociology of teaching in great detail for the first time. In doing so, he anticipated many techniques which were later to be grouped under the term ""Symbolic Interactionism"". This is a ""classic"" text which attempts to give teachers insight into their profession. In an introduction to a later edition, Brembeck explains ""one finds himself carrying on a dialogue with the book"". The reader does more than this,experiencing instead a plethora of memories and opinions. Waller takes an extremely broad brush approach which encompasses every aspect of school life, giving a map of the school as a social institution. He describes it as ""an adventure in realism"", and while his research data is of dubious origin, the startling thing about this book is its ring of truth. An essential text for anyone who has ever had anything to do with a school."
3,Not long enough!!!!,This was a Disappointing purchase for what you get. This book Does not follow the usual formula for Dora books
3,"Good book, but MUCH shorter and less involved than the Friendly Forest story","Was hoping to get more puzzles and matching games like the Friendly Forest book that my daughter just loves. This book feels a bit more like an after-thought to the Camping one. That said, my daughter still loves it but I wish it had a bit more staying power like the camping Dora book."
2,Quaint and sparse,"I liked a few of the poems, but they don't quite capture the ""essence"" of cats for me. The haikus lack the discipline of followng the 5-7-5 syllables format. The illustrations are nice."
1,A Major Disappointment,"The Author, a Yale Historian, fell into the trap of confusing New Haven's History with Yale's History. He highlighted the role of the University much more than an objective account called for. A New Haven Native and amateur Historian I was chagrined to find incomplete or otherwise flawed discriptions of events I lived through. There were a variety of petty errors that cast doubt upon how well this book was researched or proofread. For example, the reference to ""Giant Shirt Co."" should have read Gant Shirt Company. The significant role of Firearms manufacturing in and near New Haven, was all but ignored (Winchesters, Marlins, Mossburgs, Dardrick, High Standard) was not adequatly explored. Events that changed New Haven forever again were not enumerated as one might expect i.e. The Franklin Street Fire. This book will go to the first charitable book sale. It has not earned a place on my reference shelf."
4,So Beautiful,"This is a good and sometimes powerful recording, worthwhile if only for the so beautiful ""So Beautiful"" by Indran Amirthanayagam."
3,"Difficult to play, but interesting nonetheless","What is it to be a god? In this bizarre, totally unexpected epic, your PCs (immortals of levels 36+) will come to grips with the grim, powerful, and sublime reality of being pagan deities - as they seek the essence of life itself, in a futile effort to save their world from extinction! A gripping, unique adventure that I recommend highly to thoughtful players."
5,Love British Comedy,Wished the series had been longer. A pleasant look in daily life in jolly old England.
4,Great Keyboard,"This keyboard works great and was easy to install. Worth the purchase. My son at 2yrs old hammered my to pieces trying to ""fix"" it and we did not have the money to purchase a new computer and this was a great solution."
4,Fun from the 90s!,"Every time ""Third Rock from the Sun"" and ""Good Brown Gravy"" come on, my husband and I jam out like we're teenagers again!"
5,Twitches book one,"This is a good book, but I don't think you should read this to someone. I did that, but it took a long time, and there are a lot of words I don't know, so I had to keep asking my mom what they meant. This book is about two twin girls, Camryn Barnes and Alexandra Fielding, who are witches. They have special powers they can use together. But the girls don't know each other, so they are confused when they meet each other. After Alex's mom dies, she comes to live with Cam. I have four of the Twitches books, but this is the only one I have read. These books are kind of confusing, but they are still good books."
4,T.Witches,"This is a really great book. It sucks you in and does not let go until the very last page. And then you just want to read more. It has ups and downs, it shows the emotions of to very different girls and their life's becoming one. The plot takes twisting turns that you will never guess would happen, but ever is the to know from a book with a lot of magic? From the first chapter to the last page you will love every bit of it!"
4,um....The Power of Two.....i guess,"Well this is the first book. Cam and Alex met in Alex's hometown. When they first meet they save a family from dying. Then Alex's mom dies and ""Doc"" takes her to Cam's house. Will she stay at Cam's homey little house or live on her own? If i told you I would spoil the book for you. So read it if you wont to bite into a good series."
3,Goodie but oldie,Got it for a few bucks - a good illustrated book of the main kinds of plastic tests. Dated but can always update it via wiki search.
2,Mediocre at best,"This book is okay...I've read a lot of sex guides, and this is a well titled book; it's for idiots.Okay, that's a little harsh...For someone who's clueless about sex, it's definitely a good start. Actually, it can teach you enough to be pretty effective in the bed, but not as much specifics and techniques as I would have liked.As a man, I prefer Mr. Manpower's guide. I've learned a lot more specific techniques and information, and it is written by a man who can physically experience all these things, and personally share how to maximize yuor sexual potential as a man...with more intimate knowledge of his sexuality than a woman could have.I did, however, find the guide enjoyable to read, and picked up a thing or two, but as far as a sex guide for men, I would recommend Mr. Manpower's Guide.Here's a link to the Mr. Manpower blog...entertaining and informative stuff: [...]"
3,Informative. But not imaginative,"Ordered as part of a bridal shower gift, but this reads more like a mildly humorous sex-ed text book. If you're looking for scintillating tips to add something ""amazing"" to your sex life, this isn't the book you're looking for... In the publishers blurb, they mention that author Sari was chosen as a top Playboy writer; I'm guessing those who voted for her with that as the category weren't reading the magazine for the articles."
3,"Excellent Song, But Nevertheless...","1) Why wasn't this song released as a commercially-released single in a timely manner?2) Why include the album version if the similar radio mix is already included? The fact that it is included defies common sense; if they want to sell copies of AFTERGLOW the least they can do is include only the radio mix and make a consumer curious to hear the album mix.3) ""Answer"" done live is a nice treat, but it's nothing special.4) They have a multitude of excellent club mixes of ""Fallen"". Why not include 1 or 2 so that fans can own a legitimate copy of them?"
3,Quite different from the stick form,"If you really like the stick form of Nag Champa, you may not like the cone form as well. I found this had a very strong note of rose, which I've never noticed in the stick form, and thicker, more aggressive smoke. I have a very low tolerance for rose fragrance on anything but actual roses, so I probably won't be ordering this again."
3,only for big arcade fire fans,"It's not as elaborate as I'd expect for a tribute to Arcade Fire. For someone who appreciates classical music, I was a bit disappointed with the ""Tunnels"" cover, knowing that it could've been a lot more fantastic given the type of material they could work with. Maybe it's the arrangement/production that's not as highly structured as what one would expect from an Arcade Fire cover by a string quartet--there just weren't enough layers to it, compared to other String Quartet Tributes (like The Killers', Coldplay's, etc). I only like it because the tracks are Arcade Fire songs. Looking forward to better Arcade Fire String Quartet Tributes in the future."
4,Cute,This is a neat idea. You do have to have close up pictures to really be able to see them in the small screen. It was very easy to load the pictures and it is very handy to have with me to show others our most recent pictures.
1,How disappointing...,"After waiting to see John Denver's first appearance on Bob Hope for so many years, I can not tell you the level of disappointment. Wow, John is on screen for 2 minutes singing an awful parody with Hope.Only for just Hope fans."
5,Great DVD!,"As a Hope fan I bought the entire collection of his specials. Hope provides a funny snapshot of American culture, stars, and politics from the 50's through the 90's. This is fun, clean, nostalgic humor with a lot of great celebrities of the period."
3,Not what i was looking,"I expected it to teach more about how to strum well, like improvise and techiniqes to make it sound better.Instead he just teaches different styles.The one he uses normally when singing is called the normal strum. And its just too basic. Wish he had put more emphasis on that one."
1,Junk,"Ink hogPaper jammerFirst Tray 2 (optional)I received was defective (slider broken)Second Tray 2 I received(I use for 11x17) won't feedOn warranty, HP sent a reconditioned printer - wouldn't even startI'm on printer #3 (new this time), and am getting ready to send it backHave never seen a worse computer-related product from a reputable manufacturer."
1,Agreed.,"Did anyone notice that no tracks from Under tha Influence were on here? Could that be because Quik isnt under Arista anymore, I think so. Thats why this CD is bogus. Im pretty sure DJ Quick had no say on what songs were put on here. Although there are some gems on here, Balance & Options as an album was better than this whole ""Greatest Hits CD"". All of Quik's albums are pretty much better than this."
1,Spend your money on charity.,"Honestly, a waste of money. Barely works! Low power (low volume). Low fidelity. You will not use it (I don't)."
2,"Worked for a while, but...","At first this product was a great way to play all my music in my car, but after a while it started to cut the music in and out. I thought it was just mine that was doing this, therefore, I considered getting another one, but other people I knew where having the same problem. Since I haven't found any other solution to playing my iPod in my car this is unfortunately my only option."
1,TERRIBLE,"Absolutely terrible product, static is the word when it comes to the iTrip. I bought the belkin thing as a replacement and the quality is much better. It is only 20 bucks but if you are gonna spend 250 on an iPod you might as well spend another few bucks ono a good transmitter."
1,"Decided to try it, because it's cheap. Barely functions.","Doesn't work at all in two of our three cars. Actually works fairly well in the other as long as you sit the unit right next to the in-glass antenna in our highlander. Too damn bad the antenna is in the REAR OF THE VEHICLE. Also doesn't work on our home stereo unless I put it behind the reciever right next to the FM antenna. The stupid thing only tunes to some of the stations in its playlist so I thought it was broken until I found a station it would tune to and its so clumsy to tune it by playing little songs half way through and then hitting pause.With the right playlist, and some duct tape, we might use it on trips, but I tend to think its easier to just bring a case of CDs since I have to climb in the back of the car to change songs.Pros - thank god it was cheap, and it has really nice ergonomics."
4,Not as bad as everyone thinks,"I recently bought the Griffin iTrip Mini and overall I have been satisfied with it. Although it is a bit difficult to cut the static out completely especially in the Los Angeles area, the sound is good and the 1 or 2 clear stations are ok. The only difficulty that I have encountered using this product is the positioning of the ipod while driving in order to minimize static as much as possible. Other than that, it also works well on the LA to SD drive and in San Diego."
2,forget it in urban areas,this device needs open space on the FM dial. It flat out did not work in Los Angeles and will no doubt be problematic in any major urban area.
1,Griffin iTrip is a waste of money,"Before I purchased this item, I knew it was probably too good to be true. The FM transmitter looked really cool because it integrated with my iPod mini so well aesthetically. That's where the positive attributes of this item end.Here is a summary of the negative attributes:- Programming this thing is terrible. You have to load radio stations on the iPod as songs and it is a huge pain to set up.- This thing uses up your battery power very quickly on your iPod.- Because this thing works off of the iPod battery vs. a car charger, the reception is terrible.- Changing radio stations on the fly is not user friendly at all.I got rid of this within a week of purchasing it and upgraded to a Kensington unit that plugged into the cigarette lighter, lets you pick the radio station on the unit with a little lcd display, and charges the iPod while it is plugged in.Do not get the Griffin iTrip!"
2,Hard to use and iffy sound,"The basic Idea is very good. However, there are two problems with the product. First, to change the FM station it uses, you need to stop what you are playing and 'play' a short 'song' that is encoded with the right frequency. I found that to be a bad design. Second, the quality (or strength) of the transmition is poor in some cases."
1,GARBAGE product & CRUMMY service,"Bought one of these because our car stereo is factory stock and has no input or tape player for a hard-wire connection for my iPod Mini. Thought this transmitter would be a serviceable alternative. In a nutshell: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!The transmitter was never able to grab a station. followed all the instructions to a T. Emailed the company and all they did was re-hash the exact same instructions I had tried for several attempts. When I asked about what I do to value the warranty, they said go to the store I bought it!!Don't waste your time w/ this product. This is a small scale company with a small scale outlook on their business.If you need to buy a transmitter be sure to not buy from Griffin---they suck!"
2,Not as good as I expected,"I read the bad reviews and thought, ""Oh it'll work for me,"" but no. I got all kinds of static when I used the itrip (and I was in the mountains!). You have to hold it real close to the stereo and find the perfect radio station, and it still doesn't come through clearly. It's just annoying. I would suggest other alternatives to this product, for example: you can buy a cord that plugs into an auxiliary input on your stereo (my friend even has one of these on his car stereo). Or you can buy a different kind of radio transmitter that is much stronger than the itrip. There is a radio transmitter at radio shak that is better (though it requires batteries). Please don't spend your money on this."
2,I Soooo Wanted to Like It,"I really, really wanted to like this product. I read all the reviews before buying and thought I'd take my chances despite numerous complaints about static and interference in metropolitan areas. But my experience has been just the same.I downloaded the frequency finder and tried every station recommended for the NYC area. Still, the sound quality was mediocre at best - no where NEAR the fidelity of a normal FM station.Went out yesterday and bought an RCA ""Y"" adapter and now use that instead."
3,Light classic music with Dream Theater melodies,"I was expecting much heavier sounds. If you are like me, I do not strongly recommend this album. If you like melodious music with very light sounds, this might be a good choice. Probably my score should be between 3 and 4 closer to 3."
4,Very informative and easy to read.,"I enjoyed reading this book. I learned a lot about how to care for my hair and my daughter's hair. I was surprised to learn that many of the things that I was doing to our hair was unhealthy for our hair and prevented hair growth. After reading this book, I immediately threw out the shampoos that were wrong for our hair, stopped by a beauty supply store and purchased the right kinds of shampoos, contioners, and moisturizers.The only reason I did not give this book five stars is because I believe that there was too much emphasis on braids. Braids aren't the only style of choice for wearers of natural hair. I would liked to have seen more photos of women wearing their natural hair NOT in braids."
3,WAAY more stripped than documented,"I think the White Stripes are very overrated and have been since they came out - phew, now that that is out of the way I can say this album is their best. I like about one half of the album, and surprisingly it turned out to be every-other-track (not every other track on the album like, 'oh every single song except the first one' or the last one or what ever but every-other-track as in I like the first song, the third song, the fifth song, ect and dislike second song, the fourth song, sixth song, ect). That is just an example, I actually the like the second song, the fourth song, and so on and turned out to dislike the first song, the third song, and so on and so on. Except the pattern doesn't continue through to the final track where I ended up liking both of the last two songs."
3,"Average, at best","If this were an EP and the album ended after track 7, than I'd really enjoy it. The 2nd half of the album just sounds like filler. At least the price was right. It's a shame the music of today lacks the heart and energy of the artists in the late 60's & early 70's."
2,They can't all be great!,I am disapointed in this CD as a whole; it has it's moments but they're rare!
3,Highs and lows,"This album is incredible at its highest points and pretty bland at the low points. I only have a couple of white stripes albums and this seems to have the same general format as the rest (one stellar single, a few little gems, and a few seemingly filler tracks that aren't bad, but also aren't very inspired.) I still recommend people buy this, but don't expect it to change your life."
1,What a perfect title!,"Not since the Rolling Stones put out ""Sucking in the 70's"" has an album been so appropriately titled. ""Thump"" is a perfect description of Meg's drumming ""style"" (such as it is), and Jack's vocals, guitar, and songwriting are the epitome of ""Icky"". There's been some great rock and roll over the years made by marginally talented musicians (The Stooges, The Ramones, The Sex Pistols, and so many others), and there's been some great music put out by bands that were completely pretentious egomaniacs (Yes, Genesis, King Crimson), but combining pretentious egomania with marginal talent (ie: Jack White) or none at all (guess who?) just produces a blinding headache of a CD."
5,What a great album,"I remember when I first heard the track Icky Thump on the radio. I liked it right away. One day, after hearing it for about the 10th time or so, the DJ comments after the play, ""It must be tough to be the best band in the world."" And right at that moment, I had to agree. What a great song and what a great band.I really don't have a favorite band ever. It fluctuates. Sometimes I like Led Zeppelin. Sometimes Pink Floyd. Sometimes Coldplay. Sometimes NIN. Sometimes Radiohead. Sometimes System of a Down. But on that day and on many days, it's The White Stripes.I think of Jack White as a pure, old-fashioned songwriter. If he lived in less modern times, he'd probably be a very successful wandering minstrel. He captures raw emotions in words and music and crafts a completely enjoyable experience. Icky Thump is just the latest in a long string of fantastic albums.Viva The White Stripes"
3,Only 2 Good Songs,"There are only two good songs on this CD, and those are the Mission Impossible Theme songs. The rest are weird and are not in the movie!"
2,Disapointing,"This video is poorly produced and odd. I thought I was buying a professional and informational documentary, but in fact, it's just story after story of people describing various aspects of their sleep disorders without much scientific explaination for their symptoms."
1,Mouse Droppings,"We have used Sproutman in the past and have liked their products. Unfortunately, we just recently found several mouse droppings in a bag of Golden Alfalfa. Consumer beware!"
5,Great product,These wrist srtaps work so great. They let you achieve lifting heavy weights while being able to still hold onto the bar i love them!!!
2,unwieldy straps,"I bought these based on some of the good reviews and ratings, but after using them, the negative reviews were probably more on target than the positive ones. Whether you are a novice or a veteran workout buff, you will find that the basic harbinger or valeo straps will deliver a nice grip without the cumbersome adjusting and higher price tag. You won't get a better grip with these straps, just more inconvinience and loss of workout time trying to adjust to them. Keep the straps simple; stick to the basics."
4,Get a guitar massage,"These guys have been putting out yummy little records for some time and this one is no different. Save the fact that this record has a hit song on a movie soundtrack (All mixed up.) The madness that pours from a slow song into a jolted mess of guitar sounds is heavenly. The female vocal almost works, but it's distracting.All in all another belly full of electric goodness."
1,A rip-off of another book!,"This book is a rip off of ""Everything Men Know about Women"" by Dr. Alan Francis, which is also for sale on amazon. It's a rip off of the title, and of the concept (both are blank books). Further, it's an expensive rip off, as the original book is less expensive! This author should be ashamed of himself and you should not buy this book."
4,Solid Set,"Toby Keith's 1996 album BLUE MOON is a great collection of songs. Toby helped pen 9 of the 10 tracks. It opens with the great track ""The Lonely"", written by pal Chuck Cannon and his wife Lari White, and Mark Jones. ""Does That Blue Moon Ever Shine On You"" is a beautiful ballad about wishing you could still be with someone you've separated from. ""Me Too"" is the best ballad on the CD, maybe of his career, it was also a big hit for him in 1996. ""Lucky Me"" is a nice country torch ballad about moving on after a break up. ""A Woman's Touch"" is a bluesy song about wanting a woman's touch to heal one's heart. The album closes with the honky tonker ""Hello"". There is a definite maturity in his voice and his lyrics, and this is a great album before he became really popular around 1999 with his HOW DO YOU LIKE ME NOW album. Definitely a gem worth repeated listens."
5,A collection to remember!,This is a gret collection to have. I remember 3 years ago for Christmas I got it as a gift from my grandmother. It was one of the best Christmas gifts that I got that year. It has all the omen movies. The first 3 were the best. The fourth movie was alright but the series could do with out it. The remake I felt like I was in Hell literally watching the stupid remake with bad acting. But despite the bad remake and the forgetable 4th movie to the series I'm glad I have the entire collection. I won't have to wait around to watch it on t.v. during halloween and I can watch it whenever I want. And my parents wouldn't have a hard time trying to find each one cause my grandmother got the whole collection. Even if you don't like the Omen 4 or the remake of the 1976 film get the collection and just watch the first 3 films. You won't regret it.The OmenDamien: Omen 2Omen 3: The Final Conflict
4,The original's new 2-DVD Collectors Edition IS included.,"Hard to tell from the description here, but per foxhome [dot] com, the set includes:Disc 1: OMEN (2006)Disc 2 and 3: THE OMEN COLLECTOR'S EDITIONDisc 4: OMEN II: DAMIENDisc 5: OMEN III: THE FINAL CONFLICTDisc 6: OMEN IV: THE AWAKENING"
1,Not Recommended,"I love Beatle cover tunes and have a huge collection and this is definitely bottom of the barrel. The ingredients are synthesizer, an electronic drum track, and occasional use of tabla and sitar. In the background on a couple of tracks is a siren. I kid you not. I was listening this in the car and kept checking the rear view mirror. This sounds like a mash up of Lord Sitar and the Hollyridge Strings. That sounds better than it is, Both Lord Sitar and the Hollyridge Strings are enjoyable. This disc is not."
3,This book deserves real attention,"I haven't read the whole book yet, but the author definatly doesn't spend his time trying to say his book is not (propaganda). Because somewhere in the book you realize you are starting to believe what he's saying, because he's forming arguments that get you thinking about the things he says you should think about.This book is a perfect example, and an example in itself of what it is and how well propaganda really works.This books is thoroughly entertaining except for the fact that it's mostly very wordy, so, sometimes you have to get through the dry spells.Go read it!"
5,Fun,The day I got the cd I listened to it three times in a row during a road trip. Definitely good music well performed.
3,More Cronenberg,"If you want to see a Hollywood movie that manages to avoid an intelligible plot be sure to see this. David Cronenberg's comical horror-show about James Woods, a TV programmer of garbage who's life spins a little off kilter as he becomes implanted with a ""videodrome,"" a kind of cartoonish tumor implanted by God-knows-what which then compels him to murder people. Funny and disgusting, and certainly a cult classic."
3,Have a nightmare tonight!,Videographer watches the torture channel and becomes an organic robot at the hands of an evil man.
2,Not sure what all the noise is about,"Very weird film with a dark message about TV watching, I guess. I wasn't entirely sure where this was going, and I wasn't terribly impressed with the swamp monster special effects. This has gotten all sorts of cult worship over the years, but I really can't see why. Debbie Harry gives an interesting performance, and James Woods does the same hyper-schtick he went on to give throughout his career. I did like the ominous, spooky organ soundtrack, like something out of ""Phantom of the Opera."" For Cronenberg fanatics only."
4,Worth a read...,"SAFE INFORMATION TO THOSE INTERESTED IN READING THIS BOOK:I thought this book was great, the letter format was unique. It started a bit slow/boring but picked up about a 1/3 of the way through. I would recommend it to people over 15, though; some issues are hard to handle and there are some questionable situations. Also, this book is set in Australia, and their English is different from ours, in America. It's still understandable, but sometimes annoying (sorry!)<P...OVERALL COMMENTSThis book was well worth the [money] spent on it. I finished it in one sitting. Enjoy it, laugh with it (and some parts *are* cute), and even cry with it. But most importantly, learn from it about the true power of friendship."
3,"I thought it was good, but.....","I thought this book was a great book up until the end. It was an easy read that I could have read in a day but because it was for school, I had to read over three weeks. The ending made me mad because I really didn't know what happened and I REALLY wanted to know. If I read it at my own pace I don't think that I would have been so mad at the ending because of all the things I saw by reading over weeks instead of quickly in one or two days."
4,"Great book of letters, loved it","I think this was a really good book. I read another one of John Mardsen's books b4, ""So much to tell U"" I think. That book was a book of letters too. Book books were very good, esp this one. At first, it was quie confusing and hard to follow. But if u go on to read it, u'll find out what an amazing book it is. Two girls juz writing letters together, seems so simple yet so complicated. The author has put the characters forward as if it were true in actual life (whihc may even occur!). It was quite touching too. Read it. And don't be too bored by the beginning."
5,EXCELLENT horse movie!!,"For those people who love horses, this movie is one of the BEST! I used to rent this all the time when it wasn't available to buy. Now I'm going to buy up a copy for sure! This is one of the best horse movies ever made about a wild horse. The Silver Stallion is a wild Austrailian horse who has an undying will to be free- and not even Man can contain his wild spirit. I hope this is released on DVD soon, because everybody should be able to watch this movie at its absolute BEST!!! May the Horse be With You!"
2,For Kids and Horse Lovers Only,"Sensitive, sweet, child-like, expansive, and mind-numbingly boring to anyone over 12 who happens to be indifferent to horses. My four year old niece might like it."
3,Kids love it! Especially boys! They all want to be the Dirt Bike Kid!,Kids love it! Especially boys! They all want to be the Dirt Bike Kid!
3,Compilation disc.,"A compilation album, with some additional light synthesizer bridges between tracks. To allow for the bridging, some tracks, such as 'To The Unknown Man' are faded out prematurely. The tracks are digitally remastered, which is a slight improvement, but I never had many complaints with the original releases. Essentially this for listeners who do not have his RCA era (Albedo 0.39, Spiral, Heaven and Hell) releases on disc already.Two interesting tracks are on this disc. The first is a choral version of 'Hymne' and the previously unreleased, if rather unremarkable 'Sauvage et Beau' (from the soundtrack for the French television wildlife documentary of the same name)."
3,Good but... also annoying,"This is a nice selection of songs and it could be a very good complement to the album Themes for a ""best of ..."" collection. But if you want to upload this into your Ipod, beware of the annoying mixing of tracks together in many of the tracks. Well, even if you want to listen the CD in a different order, this feature will ruin the whole listening experience."
3,Great Anime Classic On A Poor DVD Transfer,"Well I really can't complain much. However, I am disappointed that there was no special qualities on this disc.They also could have had other season onto it. I mean one disc can hold a lot of stuff on it. It's like they didn't even try to make it a nice set.However, besides that. I am very happy to have this in my collection. I grew up with Ninja Turtles like a lot of people, and I think it's wonderful that it's finally out on DVD.I just wish they had spent more effort of the DVD packaging for the original program.This is the story of four mutant turtles. They are taught the ways of life through Ninja. By their father ?master? Splinter. Who is a mutated rat. Who was once human.The story concept may sound cheesy these days. However, it really is fun though.I even found my self liking April O?Niel more. The turtles human friend, who is a reporter."
3,"High on nostalgia, low on features","Quite frankly, the only benefit to getting this series on DVD instead of VHS is the economy of space. Unless of course later seasons come with special features, then it'll be more worth it."
5,Excellent General Field Guide To Florida,"This is an excellent field guide, with tons of color pictures, that cover lots of species of flora, fauna, birds and much more. Even though I am a Florida native, I have personally been using it for many years, and still carry it with me whenever I am outdoors. Our local Audubon chapter has also been providing it to local schools, teachers and children for many years. Highly recommend as a good, general guide to anyone interested in learning about Florida wildlife, plants and trees and much more. Co-president, Flagler Audubon Society"
3,It's a tiny book,"I was a wee bit disappointed in this book. It's okay, but small. I was expecting a bigger book with more information."
4,great book,"Fantastic book covering all Florida wildlife. You don't have to get a separate bird book, tree book, fish book etc. It has all Florida wildlife in one place. A good deal."
1,for the love of humanity don't do it!,"I am a fan of rock-n-roll. I even think that God Street Wine is a band of impressive creative abilities, but ""Red"" is easily the worst album in my collection of about 250 CD's. And while this is not the most extensive collection around, you must understand that of the 250+ CDs that I own, Red IS EASILY THE WORST ONE. People say that Lenny Kravits is not the most origianal song writer out there, and i agree, but at least he copies the good stuff. On Red GSW has done little more than drive old musical cliches into the ground. Other GSW albums may not be the greatest, but they at least show hints of creativity. Red does not. stay away."
4,Awesome!,"You get an ungodly amount of chalk for this price!! Nothing in particular to talk about on quality, as chalk is chalk. Some sticks (10-12) were broken, but when you get that many its not a huge deal."
4,"quality chalk, works well for what it is :)",No complaints about this chalk--colors are bright on the pavement. I love that this box of chalk should last FOREVER. It may be around for our grandkids too...
5,Festival of Lights Sparkles and Shines!,A friend of mine from synagogue made a cassette copy of this recording for me and I liked it so much I wanted my own CD of it. It's a wonderful addition to my CD collection and a welcome complement during Hanukkah season.
5,interesting narative,"Romney yet again demonstrates his clarity of thought and his leadership skills. He is a great communicator, a great leader and has served his country for a long time. This is a great read."
5,VERY THRILLING,"I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT. THE STORY KEPT YOU INTERESTED THROUGHOUT, FROM START TO FINISH. THE STORY BROUGHT OUT EVERY KIND OF EMOTION THERE IS. I DIDNT WANT TO GO TO THE BATHROOM FROM FEAR OF MISSING ANY OF IT. I CANT WAIT FOR IT TO COME OUT ON DVD."
3,It's Denzel...not Cuba Gooding jr,"I agree, this movie is awesome.Hey Stevie123abc,the star is Denzel Washington not Cuba Gooding jr...Cuba is a good actor but he doesnt even look like Denzel. Anyway, it's a great movie."
4,Good stuff,"John Creasy (Denzel Washington) is a former CIA agent hired to protect the nine year old daughter (Dakota Fanning) of a rich man living in Mexico (apparently kidnapping is a major problem in Latin America). John Creasy is an alcholoic and is less than pleaed with his new position. But after a while his young client charms him and he begins to care for her... he helps her become better at swiming and the become friends...Then one afternoon after Creasy turns his back for only a moment the girl is gone. Creasy is angry and seeks revenge... He tracks down the kidnapper little by little punishing people on the way to the actual kidnapper...I don't want to spoil the movie but I will say there is an excellent twist that some will not see coming... and for those who don't figure it out it will be shocking...With a cast so saturated with talent it is difficult to pass the one up. It is enjoyable... good story, good action and great actors. Worth checking out!"
2,"Mediocre at best, does not resemble the book.",Buy the book. The movie is mediocre at best and the script does NOT even resemble the book. Hollywood took a great book and produced a script not worth watching.
4,Last wish? I wish you had more time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie was very well done. I just saw it. I couldn`t watch the whole thing because i was frightened of the events that were happening and when the next scene of blood would be. I really liked this movie. I got it for my 10th birthday. I watched this movie with my dad. He didn`t care for it so much because he doesn`t like these kinds of movies. I liked it. I watched it because Dakota Fanning,the best actress,was in it. I think if you let a child watch this they should be at least 10 or 11. I hate bloody movies,but i saw this movie. It was full of action and it was really cool. You should watch this movie sometime. It rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Dakota Fanning ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,blie ray shipped inlo of dvd,"What the heck is going on. I ordered a dvd and I received a blue ray. If I wanted a blue ray I would have opted for that. Now I am ready to watch the movie and all settled and guess what, no, its not going to play ...I want this movie but this is getting rediculas, And by the way I now own two, copies of Dalton Abby part three also after I cancelled one and then reordered. i am getting fed up with this so please straighten out my account, so I can be a satisfied customer again.."
1,Hated It,"I am shocked at the number of people who actually thought this was a great movie, but I guess that it just a sign of the times. It was certainly a waste of Denzel Washington's talent. Creasy is a very unlikeable character, particuarly in the beginning of the movie. Who in their right mind would hire a psychologically unbalanced man with a drinking problem to guard their young daughter's life anyway? Then the never-ending violence is way over the top!!! Maybe it's just me but I cannot bear to watch someone be tortured (even if they did commit a horrendous crime) which occurs repeatedly throughtout the film. If you are a sensitive viewer stay away!!! This movie will haunt you....."
2,"Not For Young Buzz Fans, But Try These...","My two-and-a-half-year-old son is obsessed with Buzz Lightyear, and yet this video didn't hold his interest for even a minute (literally). He will still watch both the Toy Story videos over and over, but not this one. Also, as many reviewers have noted, it is pretty violent, which bothered my son when the alien got blown up at the beginning.One day we happened to find the Buzz Lightyear cartoon on TV, and he was mildly interested in that, so I though maybe he might like this video again. When we tried watching it again, he still didn't want to watch it.If you're wondering what to get for a two-year-old boy, I can tell you that my son loves ""There Goes a Garbage Truck"", which is a 30-minute video about garbage, recycling, and street sweepers. It's been his favorite for a long time, and it's not as annoying as some videos. Also, the ""Baby Mozart"" series of videos (by Julie Aigner-Clark) are a favorite with both my son and daughter (8 mos.)."
3,"Good movie, Bad price.","This is actually a pretty good movie. It's no Toy Story, but it stands on its own well. You get a brief appearance from the ""Toys"" in the beginning, but from there, it's all Buzz. My son loves the movie and requests it quite often, however, I will admit, it's more a ""boys"" movie than a family type movie. Our daughter isn't too crazy about it. It's full of action and has a great storyline. The special features are kind of lame, and that's why I rate it a 3. The price is much too high for what you get. Drop it down to $14.95 and I give it a 5."
4,To infinity and Beyond,"I rate this only 4 stars for the fact that this widescreen transfer is not Anamorphic. All widescreen DVDs should be anamorphic. Other then that this is great. This is actually the first three episodes of the tv show. There is tons of laser fire. There is more laser fire in this then A New Hope. Boys love lasers. Still only machines get blown up and it is not any more violet then the Toy Story movies. This tells Buzzes backstory and helps explain why Buzz was so depressed when he found out he was a toy in the first Toy Story. In this movie Buzz is a spaceranger and fights for Justice with his friends X-R, Booster, and Mira. There seems to be a debate on whether Buzz or Woody is the coolest Toy. If you are a Toy Story fan who thinks Buzz is the coolest then go buy this DVD right now. Also watch the TV show a good one."
1,ROTTEN...JUST ROTTEN,"This movie is so bad I don't even know where to begin. At first I thought it was just me, but neither my 5 year old or 2 year could stand it either. Look for a lot people unloading this dog on EBAY. It will probably sell a million copies before the word gets out about how bad it is. STAY AWAY FROM THIS!"
4,the adventure begins,"The 3 part beginning to the cartoon series, (the 2 seasons were never released to video or DVD. Silly Disney Corp.)READ the description, Region is Not USA, requires a dvd player set to Europe region. ( dont know what it is? try googleing it , )This DVD can be saved to your computer and played or burned to a ""backup disk"" to play on the home dvd player.Personally, I have 2 dvd player, one is set to Region 1 - USA, the other is set to Region 3-4 // or Most players have a setting to change the region of the player.Note that even with region set to 4 the player did play this region 2 dvd. = played with DVD Player and also ripped to mp4 to play on the computer. No Problem!The cartoon itself is interesting and entertaining. A very good addition to the Toy Story set. It would be even better if the rest of the series was available."
2,Not for young kids,"Not for kids 6 & under. Very male oriented, faced paced, intense movie with a good share of violence, scary creatures, death and destruction of good guys. More action than story. Last minute happy ending does not solve the problem. Boys 8-12 will like it best.Disney cannot work at Pixar`s level. John Lasseter, the greatest story teller of our time, and author of the two Toy Story movies, has no apparent role in the production of this cartoon."
3,Spanx Footless Hosiery,"I like the IDEA but I don't think they ""held up"" very well for the price paid. I purchased a nude and black pair and both ""ran"" the 1st time I wore them. I have hosiery that I paid less for that I have had for SEVERAL YEARS and washed them in lingerie bag in the washing machine that I have had to discard because the elastic finally started to give but they did not run. I would look for something similar at a lesser cost but would not order this brand again."
1,Dullsville,"This is one of those movies, like ""Citizen Kane,"" that people think is a classic and I don't understand why. I turned it off after a half an hour--utterly boring."
5,Great music.,"Timeless western ballads that are always a pleasure to hear. Great lyrics,music, and singer. What else could you ask for?"
2,dissappointed,"its okay the swabs are not as fat with cotton as i would like them to be, they skimpy with the cotton and are about half the usual amount."
1,Check with your bank(s) before purchasing,"My bank allows for financial information to be downloaded in QIF format, so I thought I wouldn't have any problems. Big mistake- in an insidious attempt to wrangle money out of financial institutions, Quicken 2006 purposely disables the ability to import QIF files for nearly all types of accounts. Those institutions that don't pay up (typically smaller banks and credit unions) can't produce files in the new format (QFX), making the software virtually worthless for their customers. So, unless you enjoy entering dozens of transactions by hand or are from a select list of Quicken partner banks, don't waste your money.UPDATE: I sent the software back to Intuit under their ""60 Day Money Back Guarantee"" policy and received a check in the mail a few weeks later refunding the full amount I paid. So, on the bright side, if you find that the software doesn't work for you, you can get your money back without much hassle."
3,Quicken Basic 2006 Bug,This is good product but there is one serious flaw. Qicken Basic 2006 is incompatible with Fidelity Net Benefits so you cannot download 401K information. You must have Quicken Deluxe or Premiere. I now have to pay an additional $20.00 to upgrade.
1,No QIF Import - Don't waste your money,"Be warned! Quicken 2006 doesn't support QIF import. I know (now) that this shortsighted business decision started with Quicken 2005 but I'm still hopping mad about it. Intuit decided that they wanted to extract more of their exorbitant OFX licensing fees from financial institutions by eliminating QIF import support. Some financial institutions in turn pass these fees directly on to the customer.I don't really care how many new bells and whistles Quicken 2006 has. It doesn't perform a fundamental function that financial software should be capable of doing: importing standard online statement file formats. Without this capability, Quicken is a complete waste of money."
1,Do not buy if you want to write checks with it,I have used quicken for years. I bought a new computer and got an upgrade(at least I thought so) with it. It is not user friendly. I tried to use the check writing part. You have to order checks through Intuit with your name address and bank numbers on them. The only thing you can do is put the amount who it is to and a check number on it. What is the use if you cannot print the whole check with a blank form. What a waste this is! I am throwing mine away and getting something else. I would not recomend this to my worst enemy!
5,Perfect,"This was the perfect addition to my Elk setup. I needed a simple arming and disarming pad in the master bedroom. This one fits in a single-gang wall box, and uses a standard decora style cover plate. I had it installed and running within a couple minutes. It hooks into the data bus on the Elk M1. Once you have it installed, do a bus module enrollment, and it works like a charm."
4,"Irreverent, superbly written, interdisciplinary, enlightenin","Dixon is a former artillery officer, Sandhurst graduate, and self-described authoritarian personality, who left the Army and became a clinical psychologist. He uses both sets of experiences to analyze why officers in armies throughout history--mostly British, but the principles are generally applicable--have fallen into a stereotypical pattern of incompetence specific to senior military leaders. Much of the reason, he believes, derives from personality development, but the book is refreshingly devoid of psychobabble and is written in an astonishingly clear style. A real eye-opener, after which military history will not be quite the same to the reader again."
4,Raunchy?,"Just wish to say that I have had this set for a number of years. Not certain what is and what is not raunchy. I wanted to counter the sole review because for me this is one of my go to cds for blues. I bought it to better learn to play the blues, appreciate the blues, familiarize myself with what should be a group of classical blues musicians. I am not qualified to say whether it is the best CD for this or even if it is a good compilation. Anyone that wants to do this can easily assess because all songs and artists are listed on Amazon. But for me, and for what I bought it for I give it a 4"
2,Looks like they had extra time on the set of a low budget porn,I am only giving two stars because it actually had my four year old of the crunch doing a few yoga poses. This is very low budget and odd. There s a shirtless yogi that floats in and out at times who reminds me of Ron Jeremy.
5,Can't tell the difference between these and Oreo Golden's!,These taste just like the Oreo Golden cookies. We love vanilla sandwich cookies and were looking for healthier choice. These organic cookies are just the perfect solution. Healthier (than cookies with unnameable ingredients) and delicious!
4,really an amphibian book more than a frog book,"This is a wonderful book! I checked it out of the library because my son (2 1/2) is obsessed with frogs, and he loves it. It is on the long side, and I'm not sure I would recommend it for kids just learning their alphabet, but it does have soem good information in it. My only actual complaint about the book is that I'm not fond of some of the comments that are meant to be light-hearted, but that's my personal taste more than anything."
4,... at Ashley River El.,"I read The Alphabet Frog Book.I thought it was good. I learned a lot about differnt frogs. Fogs are my favorite animals.I also thought the pictures were good.One thing I thought you could put more of, is clues. It also had good details. Your books are good but there are other books I like.Bye!"
4,Smart woman!,Written in short entertaining paragraphs which I can only assumed where formed from Deborah Sampson diary as the book states she kept one most of her life after she learned to read. Deborah was known to be a very smart child and as a adult even taught as a school teacher for a while until she became eager to travel the world. She saw her chance in joining the American Revolution dressed as a man. She even fooled her own mother dressed up.The book is easy to read and entertaining with drawings of Deborah and her history. I think it is an excellent read for children to learn how far women have gotten to this day and in Deborah's time period. I would be interested to see more books about her. I do not know if any books are out there in adult format but there should be if her diary is around.
3,Jesse R History class thing,This book is interesting and exciting. It leaves you on the edge of your seat reading more just wanting to know what is next. At some points you are afraid what is going to happen. I would recommend this book for 6th-8th graders but most likely everyone would like the book.
4,I love this camera....,"It is no ""pro"" camera... but for the price, size and ease to use, this camera is great! I love its design, its look, speed! Everything about it."
3,I liked another product better but this one was helpful too.,"I purchased two books about baby swim lessons, and this one has some great illustrations but the instruction itself is pretty scant."
1,Simply Awful,"Before I purchased this camera, I was very loyal to Kodak cameras. Since purchasing this camera, I have not even considered wasting my money on a kodak. I went on a roadtrip and brought this camera along. Several of my travel companions also had the same camera. By the end of the trip, almost all of these cameras had damaged/unusable screens. I still used the camera throughout the trip (despite the fact that it doesn't have a view finder or anything)and the printed pictures were what you would expect from a point and shoot. I tried to return the camera or get it repaired, but they told me it would cost $200 dollars to make the repair. Personally, I think there should have been a recall on this product because of the overly fragile screens."
3,Outdoor not indoor,"I bought this camera last October. I have been very disappointed with it. It takes great outdoor pictures but for indoor pictures it is a crap shoot. They might look good on the screen but once downloaded too often they are blurry or grainy. The flash can be harsh on the eyes when used, especially with kids and in my opinion make the picture too bright. And not using the flash the pics are worse than ever. I am tired of getting cameras that take great outdoor pics and HORRIBLE indoor pictures. Course I have just been sticking to Kodak easyshare cameras so might be time to change brands."
4,"Rochester, NY still putting out the goods.","I dont care what anyone says, kodak cameras have THE best color than any other brand and this camera proves it. The pictures are very detailed, even though it only has a 3x zoom, the image can be further zoomed upon on photoshop and still is clear. 2 things I dont like about it is the zoom sound when video recording and how the buttons are spread out, but over all a good camera. Finicky people need to get a grip."
1,Nothing but disappointment,The V1003 is my third Kodak camera. The first two went to our children. The picture quality was good only in bright light situations. The flash did not provide adequate light indoors. I resorted to taking pictures indoors without the flash for better results. Blurring and grainy pictures led me to Kodak for help. They were useful in assisting me in syncing my flash to the camera but results were only slightly better. I really lost the fun in point and shoot picture taking because this camera always disappointed.
2,LCD viewer,"The LCD screen freezes, leaving it un-usable to view pictures. Happened 16 months after purchase of the camera. Second time it has happened with a Kodak camera. Kodak wants to charge $80 to repair. Will be looking at Nikon and Canon.Night pictures are terrible."
2,Awful Camera,"This is our 2nd Kodak,we loved our old one, but someone bought us this one for a gift and I regret giving away the old one. I have a toddler and I have zero pictures of her face, I have plenty of the back or side of her head. This has the WORST delay ever. My pictures are often blurry and out of focus. Our old camera was a 5 MP and took much much better pictures than this thing. I would not recommend this camera to anyone. Kodak missed the spot with this camera.I did have to give it two stars because, it is compact and very easy to use. Kodak is very user friendly, the buttons are labeled well and the menues are easy to follow."
1,movie download porblems,"lets u film movies in HD mode one problem is the movie uses 700GB thats bigger then a dvd for less then 20 minutes worth lenth . I wanted to save theese to cd - r rom but the movie I made with the camera where too big just the same size as a hollywood dvd . the other problem was Downloading the movie to my pc after dueing so the movie kept freezing up on my pc when playing. Can any body tell me why it skips on my pc. I was filming on boat in fast motion but it downloaded with slipping problems. when playing it on the camera it dident have that problem. its possible it downloaded with problems.. all it takes it one crew up and u wont be happy with this camera. Any body else having this problem ?? reply to my question & I will read it latter, thanks"
1,Worst camera ever!,This camera takes horrible pictures. They are grainy and blurry and in no way look like what a 10 MP picture should look like. It also takes way too long to even focus & take a picture. I owned a DX7630 which was a 6.0MP and it took far better quality pictures. Do not waste the money on this camera. It is junk!
2,no good quality,"this camera isnt what we expect, when you take pictures, the camera make change in pictures colors and photos quality is very poor, i repent to buy it."
3,why the picture comes with too much light or black in the low light spots,i bought this camera a month before. i don't get why the picture comes so dark in the low light places. sometimes it comes completely dark in those cases. i am tired of it because i can't take any decent picture in the clubs or at night. does anyone have any suggestion about it. i played with manual but nothing seems to work. please help me if someone know about it.
3,Pictures too dark,I bought the Kodak V1003 in late August 2007 at Target...I find I am constantly using the PERFECT TOUCH technology feature in the camera to brighten up the picture... I primarily take pictures of people....I personally like brighter pictures than this camera takes...Although I love all the user- friendly features and durability (dropped it on hard concrete...no damage!) of this Kodak camera ...I decided to buy the Canon Powershot SD 750 Elph camera last week from amazon and so far I am much happier with the brightness of this Canon camera's pictures!
4,Clave Companion,This works very well. I get a much better sound using this than just holding my clave in my hand.
5,Best book I have read on SQL*Plus,This is a excellent book to learn SQL*Plus or to refine your knowledge. I teach several Oracle classes and I recommend this book to students to clarify important concepts. I would highly recommend this book to those that want to expand their knowledge of SQL*Plus.
2,Not wearable,Returned these. EE is narrower than some D boots I've had. insole is uncomfortable and no insert is going to fix it. My Ariats fit much better.
5,Lo mejor de Aznavour,"Tuve la oportunidad de adquirir esta versión de sus Éxitosy quedé sumamente complacido. Me encantó la Mamma... realmentees uno de mis favoritos lleno de nostalgia, que nos invade hasta llenarnos de sensibilidad, igual digo de La Bohemia ""La Boheme"". No dejen de adquirirlo, y resultará una experiencia que nunca olvidarán, sino que lo querrán oir una, y otra, y otra vez, hasta que cada nota quede grabada en sus corazones."
1,dont bother with this book,plain and simple dont waste your money on this old information taken of other official documents dont waste your dollars
1,Waste of money,I could have bought this at the craft store for .50 onstead of $30! Too bad my son saw it or I would have sent it back.
1,Hypocritical!,"Specially when you consider that the author is a significant contributor to that noise! I guess writing this book is one way to make money in this economy. ""A fool and his money are soon parted"" Dont be a fool - dont part with your money. There are many other books that will contribute to your education in the market in a positive way."
5,Best Tenor compilation CD,"I'm not really into Opera, but I love this CD. The music exerpts are classics; and the performances by world class tenors are awesome, in English, Italian, French, and Spanish.I had this CD years ago, but it was lost during one of my moves. Just receptly found it available here, and snapped up a new CD. What other CD do you like so much that you'd eagerly buy a 2nd copy?"
3,CLASSIC BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S SO GREAT...,"Of course HOTTER THAN HELL is a classic KISS album, but that does not mean it is so great as some people say. IT's an average KISS album, when you still could see clearly their musicians' musical limits and the total dumbness of the lyrics. Anyway, KISS will always be KISS and, even being average for KISS standards, it's miles and miles better than most of the crap that is being released around nowadays !!"
2,Play three chords and scream about girls......,"That just about describes this album. Not much imagination or musical expertise shown here. Kiss was always better live anyway. The studio cuts of their best songs are usually far inferior to live versions. While no KISS album deserves 5 stars, better choices are the albums released when they became a better band: Double Platinum, Alive I and II, Destroyer (their best), Love Gun and Rock 'n' Roll over."
3,I don't know what happened,"Where this album came from is anyones guess. Poor quality recording and not many good songs at all. So many great songs on the debut album but #2 just made the critics all the more sure that they were right about kiss being a failier. Its not terrible, you might like it, i mean, i liked a few songs but it dosen't have the overall greatness that most kiss albums have."
4,Awesome Kiss release.....,"Of all the KISS albums, this is my favorite. I have had this cd for years ( I had the record as well) and I listen to it frequently. If you had to get one KISS cd, this would be it. Two thumbs up!!"
3,Has Some Okay Moments.,"This second album from Kiss has never got much attention from me. The songs aren't bad really, it's just that they don't leave much of a mark and aren't very memorable. I do admit that this album sounds a bit heavier than the debut, but I still like the first album better than Hotter than Hell. ""Strange Ways"" is pretty cool, and I like the meaty sound of the guitars. ""Parasite"" has some good parts also. I actually give this album two-and-a-half stars. But since you can't grade on a half, I upped it to three instead of giving it a two."
4,For a lost soldier,"Well acted, interesting, touching but also challenging. Although some viewers can find this story a bit disturbing (love between a boy and a soldier), it's worth to watch.Personally, I am still looking for an answer to one question. How much the adult life of Jeroen (the boy) became influenced by his first love.The director avoided unnecessary shocking and didn't push the envelope. He just told a simple story that took place in the dusk of II World War. Both Marteen Smit (the boy) and Andrew Kelley (the soldier) delivered excellent performances.If you look for a quality cinema, this one is perfect for you."
3,Trying hard not to be bias,"There is a reason why there are age restrictions in sexual situations when it comes to these matters. An older person will always have control of the situation, where as the young, innocent and curious person is all too naive, and ready to try something that they concieve as good because it is being presented by an adult, whom they so much are ready to become. We all have the right to grow, experiment, and experience what life has to offer us, but within our realm and circle. I understand the boy's curiosity though, for when I was, but only four years older than he, I experienced the same. Although not bitter, I know that I can never part take in something such as this. I give it three stars because this movie, inspite of it's story, is well acted and tastefully done. Would only recommend it to individuals that can openly see it for what it's worth, without getting too upset over the subject."
2,This book doesn't quite sink.,"Dedicated Titanic collectors will want to add this book to their collections. It does what no other single book has done--list the passengers on the Titanic. And does it ever list! List after list after list. They are not easy to use, but they do provide information for anyone who is in the mood for digging. The book's lists are confined to the passengers. Didn't the Titanic carry crew? Why not make the definitive book on people aboard the ship include everyone? Much work clearly went into this book, and it will join my collection, but I may never open it again."
4,A study in scarlet,"A study in scarlet is the first Sherlock Holmes adventure with Dr. Watson, the classic crime-solving partnership. I read it in Spanish (my first language) when I was around 9 years old and I love it at that time.I just finish reading it, 21 years later and in english, and I still think is a great book.....short enough to read it in a week, probably less, nevertheless, complex enough to catch your attention.I haven't finish The Sign of 4 yet, but so far it seems to be as good as a Study in Scarlet!"
5,Absolutely wonderful!,"A full-cast BBC dramatization, A STUDY IN SCARLET is spellbinding! Clive Merrison and Michael Williams shine as Holmes and Watson, bringing humanity and clarity to the roles. No idiot Dr. Watsons or overly-serious Holmes' here. What a treat!"
5,This was a very interesting book and had a great plot.,This book was with Holmes and Watson. I am only thirteen and could understand it pretty well. Holmes and Baker are investigating a murder. They stumble into some twisting and mind boggling facts about the case. Read this book and you will be very suprised by it.
5,Review: A Study in Scarlet,"I really enjoyed this book! It was an engaging read and I never felt it lagged. It had good plot development and characterization, but at the same time didn't drag on. This is a good place to start for anyone who is interested in Sherlock Holmes; it's Sir Arthur Doyle's in the series. The syntax in story reflects a late 20th century British style. This should not be seen as an obstacle to new readers of the classics as its a fairly simple read. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a great mystery novel."
1,WHAT A WASTE!!!,"Our daughter wanted a beach ball from Santa last month, so Santa ordered these beach balls, so he thought. First of all, the advertising for this ""beach ball"" is misleading. The picture shows lots of beach balls, 5 of them to be exact. Well, my fault for not reading closely, but I was in a hurry comparing beach balls and seen the picture, clicked on it thinking I just bought 5 beach balls and got one. My fault. Secondly, the beach ball was supposed to be 12"". Well, it was more like 8"". Thirdly, there was no check valve on the air valve. You know how most inflatable things allow you to blow air in and it holds the air in so it won't blow back out when you remove your mouth from the valve. This did not so it was IMPOSSIBLE to get the ball fully inflated because it was so small. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,Don't buy this ball,"This ball is more like 7 inches in diameter. It is near impossible to inflate because the air rushes back out before you can seal it. It doesn't matter, because it won't stay inflated anyway."
3,Cost More Than In the Store,"I ordered this item together with a fan. The fan was delayed/back order, and later was canceled because by the time it was ready to be delivered (2 months later) my credit card happened to expired. I went to Lowes to look for a replacement of the fan, I saw this item on sell for 1/3 of the price that I paid here to get it. After all this time I paid more for this item, while holding on to it for the fan to come -the fan never comes anyway. I am disappointed at the situation! Next time I will go straight to a store and get the items I want rather than ordering them on the internet with the inconvenience of back order item. I didn't know it was in back order, only after I placed an order."
3,"Good product, questionable packaging","I've been using Durex condoms for a while now so the quality of the product was never in question, and it's definitely a good deal. However, I received the condoms in a brown mailing envelope rather than some sort of official Durex packaging which makes me question their authenticity. When we're talking about protection from unplanned pregnancies and STDs, nothing should be up for question."
1,Never got it...,"I saw another review of someone else who also ordered this in the middle of november, its over a month and still have not received anything from them either"
3,Great deal,"The price was excellent. For a variety of 60 condoms, it was a great deal. Some other reviewers commented on where the ""Made in"" country was supposed to be...I don't know where they are supposed to be made but they seemed to work fine. The only thing that I didn't like was that all 60 condoms were shoved into a tiny cardboard box about the size of small coffee mug. This caused some packs to be bent and folded. You would think that they would be packaged more carefully so they don't get damaged or they'll be useless when you're having sex! The shipping also took longer than the estimated date so if you need these right away, you may be waiting."
2,False Advertising,"Simply didn't get the styles specified. At all. If you care about variety don't get this. Also, I noticed that I received mostly XXL so if this a concern of yours, look elsewhere."
4,Great Value,"Great value... 60 condoms for what, $9. The condoms came in pairs, randomly shoved in a brown box. They were all there... just a little sketchy. They've all worked so far though!"
4,good buy,"good for on the go. nothing special about them, but they did the job. overall a good product. i recommend"
1,Question on the package and manufacturing address,"We got the package, but the stuff in it was made in India and Thailand. Was it supposed to be U.N. of condoms? Why there's no information in the website?Even more, the manufacturing date printed on those 'Made in Thailand' can be blurred by hand."
3,Quicken review,"Works well enough, although it seems to be challenged by multiple accounts with same credit card bank."
1,More complicated than ever,"I have been using Quicken since 1997 and loved it. I last had 2001 before buying 2006. I liked 2001, but didn't like the new sunset/upgrade policy. I got 2006 anyway. Right now, I wished I hadn't. I can't figure out how to change my online settings. I can not change the online sttings to recognize my dsl account or any of my credit cards. I also don't like having to enter a password everytime I try to log in. They should have kept it simple."
3,Just know that you WILL upgrade--or else,"I was a Quicken user for many years. If you decide to purchase, just remember that you will be upgrading whether you are happy with the current product or not. After spending hundreds of dollars, losing functionality (I really miss the inventory program that used to come with it) and dealing with tech support that consistently told me to wait until the next release, I recently received e-mail telling me I would not be able to use ""online bill pay; downloading financial data from your bank, credit union, credit card, brokerage, 401(k), or mutual fund accounts; downloading stock quotes, news headlines, and other financial information into Quicken; uploading portfolio information from Quicken to Quicken.com; and access to the investing features on Quicken.com, including portfolio tracking, any watch lists you have created, One-Click Scorecard, Stock Evaluator, and Mutual Fund Evaluator"" after April 26 unless I upgrade from 2003 to 2006. I use MS Money now..."
4,Long time user with long time problems.,"Don't let the review title fool you. I like the product and have used versions of it since the late 1980's. It is the leading product and I would not recommend any other. My pet peeve is that the Retirement Planner refuses to believe the retirement date I give as input. Therefore, it does not compute 'growth' and starts tapping my retirement savings 'Today'. Support says it is a data driven error and they recommend useless things like rebuilding indices. My data file passes all tests but the retirement planner produces garbage for the past three releases I have used. (It worked a few years ago). The second useless suggestion was to start with a 'fresh' data file. I refuse to lose over 15 years of data to fix bad Quicken code. After reading other internet sources, I am not alone in having problems with the retirement planner. A sad failing in an otherwise excellent product."
1,No QIF Import? Then no Quicken 2006!,"I tried upgrading from Quicken 2001 to Quicken 2006 Deluxe and liked everything about it except the most important thing: Quicken 2006 will not allow me to import my transaction data from my bank.Why? My bank, like MANY others, supports the QIF file format. Intuit deliberately disabled this feature after Quicken 2004. I spoke with my bank and discovered that the new download method, ""direct connect,"" requires the bank to pay large fees to Intuit.Big disappointment!"
5,Mobile Suit Gundam 00 complete 2nd season,Awesome. If u like to watch Gundam series this is a must have to any collection. To me this series is my 3rd best behind Gundam Seed & Gundam Seed Destiny.
5,Awsome way to enjoy comics.,"Well, no one else has reviewed this yet, and I figured it was about time. IMHO, Full Cast Audio Dramas such as this one, are the only way to do comics! I really enjoy all the characters, Nomi in particular. There's something about her voice that just brings the character to life. I highly recomend this Audio Drama to all STAR WARS fans out there, especially those who don't normally like reading comics."
1,Not satisfied,"This watch was purchased for a christmas gift and when my husband went to use it, it didn't work. The stem had to be held in, in order for it to work. I emailed the seller 3 days ago, through Amazon, and haven't heard back from them yet on what they are going to do about it. I just want an exchange, not a refund."
3,No pregnant woman should NOT be wearing these underwear this far along,"I bought these for a wedding I was standing up in at 36 weeks. Overall I am satisfied with the construction of the product... meaning they do what they are supposed to do. At 36 weeks along and felt as though my child was going to be squeezed right out of me. Other reviews mentioned back support, but I was in major pain after wearing for a little over an hour. Needless to say these babies came off immediately... after the ceremony that is."
1,Never met a pregnant person this skinny,"I ordered a size c, although my weight and height put me in a b. I ordered big just to be comfy. I think i need a size f! These were soooo tight. These are awful for a pregnant person. I couldnt even get them past my thighs. Sending them back. I got the skinny britches instead. Way more comfy."
5,Futuristic Fun,Space Junk is an imaginative book that I got hooked the first day I started reading it. I love the plot of the book and would stay up late to find out what would happen. The characters where great and had such real personalities. I loved the book. Thank you!
4,Women Mentoring Women,Book arrive on time. Content of book was what I was looking for. No problems with ordering or receiving shipment.
2,Routine outing for DeLuise,"One of the great virtues of ""Stargate SG-1"" was that it gave its directors free reign to be visually inventive. Peter DeLuise's episodes are some of the finest in this regard. However, anybody looking for PdL's visual talent in ""Beyond Sherwood Forest"" will come up empty. It's a thoroughly routine piece of made-for-TV hackwork, visually anonymous throughout. Erica Durance is spirited as an anachronistically action-ready Maid Marian and Robin Dunne of ""Sanctuary"" is adequate as an unusually young Robin Hood, while Julian Sands is deplorably hammy as the sheriff of Nottingham. Kent Richmond's syphilitic monarch is the only idiosyncratic element. British Columbia stands in convincingly for rural England and the Blu-Ray transfer is handsome but you won't want to watch this more than once, probably not at all."
1,one of the worst movies and could not finish,"Opening scene: working peasants dressed in immaculately clean and ironed clothing. Embarassing attention to detail, script, acting and poor film overall. It was so BAD no one could bear to watch more than a few minutes of the film. It will be thrown out with the rubbish."
3,"12th Century ""Sanctuary""","I watched this on the SYFY Channel and wasn't expecting anything profound. I was correct in that assessment but I found in quite enjoyable nonetheless.Although I didn't care for the killing off of Friar Tuck I thought it had its interesting takes on the Robin Hood mythos. Robin Dunne was adequate as Robin of Locksley and Erica Durance made an adventurous Marian.I think a larger budget could have made the scenery more convincing but I understand in this day that money is tight.Over all, i was satisfied with this made for TV straight to DVD movie."
5,Wonderful resource,We bought this book for our church youth group (grades Kindergarten through sixth grade). The children loved learning about hiking and how to use a compass. We were able to stretch out the lessons into six one hour sessions.
2,This is not K&TG first album,"The other reviewer had a nice review of Kool & the Gang's first album, aptly titled Kool & the Gang. I agree with everything that reviewer said, except that this is the wrong album. This appears to be some greatest hits collection of 80s Kool stuff, not the great Ghetto Jazz of the early 70s. So buy the original Kool & the Gang, not this greatist hits knock-off"
3,Reggae from Brazil,Overall this is a lovely CD although at some point it became a little repetitive. I love this different take on an old Genre. These guys are great!
3,Skank review,"It was not what I was hoping for, but the CD is okay. I enjoy the Skank MTV Live CD much more."
5,A Novel Poem,"How unique, new yet old, to use a series of poems today to tell the story of a life. It reminds me of the classics of Greek and Roman times. It is a wonderful story written in love, richness, respect, and wisdom. A wisdom and understanding of life that usually only comes with age and time and not normally from one so young. But, there it is in its fullness of spirit, a sharing, a wonderful book, and a wonderful read."
3,Horno....Horno....Horno...Let's Go....,"Classic Cheese...How could you not like this movie. This is one of the few movie's that Beautiful Playmate Dorothy R. Straton had done. Get this movie, wait for a snow day and sit back a watch and pray to the lord 'Harley Davidson', the lord and master, vvvvvrrrrrrrmmmmmmm, vvvvrrrrrrrrrmmmmmmmm..."
1,the film that killed Avery Schriebers career,"What a waste of time and HD-DVD.Perhaps one of the worst movies ever,and not in a good way.It ends so abruptly you might throw your neck out.Miss Stratton is lovely of course but the film is poorly lit and badly edited and her time on screen is limited.Not even a black midget and lame stoner jokes could save this tossed together junk.View at your own risk.Note;review based on dvd release."
1,Where's MST3K When You Need Them?,"If you are like me, and saw this flick when you were younger and have fond memories of it, then save your memories and your money. What was I thinking? Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing. The jokes are horrible and the timing drags...like watching grass grow. This movie makes ""Spaceballs"" look like an Oscar winner! To add insult to agony, the quality of this DVD is worse than a Betamax bootleg. Fuzzy distorted picture, muddy sound. Probably the worst film quality I've seen since I saw ""Hercules in New York"" on the Late Late movie. Cult? Yes!, Classic? Only if you are really stoned."
5,Real Man's beautiful watch!,"[..]. Pro:I purchased this as a gift for my husband. It is beautiful, showy, manly, sexy and he is proud to show it off. I would call this a ""real mans"", watch. Con: You have to move to wind it and if you let it sit for a few days you have to ""rewind/shake it""."
2,A beautiful looking watch but doesn't work!,"I received my watch yesterday, and was so impressed with the packaging, the box from Stuhrling, the weight and feel of the watch, and the face and skeleton works is incredible. I thought this was the coolest watch I've ever had. I wound it gently to get it started . . .it ran for a couple hours then STOPPED, I wound it again, and 10 minutes later, stopped again. Then I thought, I'll wind it and wear it allowing the self winding mechanism to do its job. So disappointed, it stopped two more times, so I sadly placed everything back in the orignal packing, and am going to drop it off at UPS Monday to ship back to Amazon. Too bad, as the look is impressive, but I really need it to run too!!!!! Now, I'm afraid to order another Stuhrling watch for fear of the same experience. I will say Amazon is always great about returns, but I want a Skeleton watch that runs!"
4,OUTSTANDING STYLE,This watch has an outstanding style it would have been better if it came with a metal band rather than leather. Anyways when I'm wearing it people notices and are asking me where I bought it. In fact one of them bought. I changed the leather strap with a metal band to make it look more elegant. I am really proud to have bought this watch.
4,Great Value - Stunning Appearance,"I am very please with the appearance of my new Stuhrling Winchester Skeleton Watch. The level craftsmanship is similar to other watches that cost much more. The mechanism of this watch is very well displayed through the front and back crystals....it truly does seem like they have only left the skeleton of the watch intact. This allows clear view of the various gears and the automatic winding mechanism....something that a mechanical engineer such as myself will find fascinating. One other thing that I was not expecting to be impressed by was the band....this is a quality leather band that is not only substantial, but also eye-catching!!!"
1,Didnt watch the movie.... cause it never came...,"Today is July `5th, and amazon sent me an email saying that the last day my movie was going to be delivered was July 7th. I havent seen any movie and I am pretty mad right now. Not to say that there is no phone number in the site to call customer service, I seek for help in the site but there was no link that said something like ""Lost packages"". I dont know... Know I paid good 20 bucks for a movie that i dont think ill see in a long time"
3,Lush but not practical,"I like P. Allen Smith very much and looked forward to receiving this volume. It's a lovely tome, but not very practical for the home gardener with somewhat harsh growing conditions and limited space and resources."
5,GREAT DEBUT!,"This is my first KISS cd, but in seeing that it was their debut, I must say that I am very, very impressed. This debut has to be one of the best that I have ever heard, and I do have Led Zeppelin I. Just buy this, or Alive!, and you'll be happy."
5,Kiss rules.,"Great record. The second best Kiss album ever. I especcially like strutter, black diamond and love theme from Kiss."
5,A very well interpreted set...,"John Williams's Barrios album has stolen my heart. It is obvious that there was a lot of heart and artistry that went into this recording. He plays the music absolutely brilliantly. These tracks can be used as textbook examples of how the music should sound and be interpreted. Williams is a very lyrical player with stunning technique. Pieces like the two Valses and Las Abejas show of his wonderful technical skills and the Mazurka Appasionata and Una limosna por el Amor de Dios show how Williams can take a lyrical piece and make it sound like the most beautiful thing you'll ever hear. Some pieces stand out more than others, but this album is an essential for any classical guitarist or lover of Late Romantic Latin American classical music."
3,"Oh Lord...Not Denzel, too???","Tres Mad Max, though without Tina Turner. Lessee. Strong Mad Max clone. Denzel playing the part of Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson eventually showed himself to be a religious zealot. Now, Denzel is openly playing a religious zealot in this film. I hope he doesn't continue down the Gibson road. Just look @what a train wreck Mel's life has turned into. Denzel: don't move to Malibu. Also, stay away from the sauce!!Oh, as an aside. The film style is minimalist. The style will register w/a small number of viewers. The character development is also too little, too late. Those two factors are why this film flopped when it was released. I like Denzel & Gary Oldman very much. They couldn't save this film, though. Were it not for them. I never would have finished watching it. Very unrealistic pistol craft, wound survival, & general small arms work. That's the way w/most films, though. It's a pity there apparently aren't many directors who have ever fired a weapon..."
4,The Book of Eli,"Denzel Washington does a great job heading West on a post Apocalyptic road. He reads the Bible daily and although he may have to kill others to survive, he keeps his faith true. Gary Oldman is an unscrupulous man that desires the last King James Bible in Washington's possession no matter how he has to get it. He sends gang after gang to retrieve it to no avail. When he finally joins in the hunt he finally obtains it, but sometimes even a well read person can not read what's coming in the way of God's ironic retribution. My only objection to the movie is Washington kills a cat with the same lack of remorse that he dispatches the vultures of society. That scene did not improve the movie except for cat haters which I fully expect to give me negative votes. Basic extras and good quality picture and sound. If you enjoyed this catchI Am Legend (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition)CA Luster"
2,This Book is Not Worth the Read,"A cat is killed in the opening scene for food, yet Denzel is kind to a rat, who he feeds some of the cat meat to. It made me know right away that I wasn't going to like this. The desert town he goes to is too old western cowboy. The world is desolate now, yet everyone still has stylish sunglasses? And where do they get the gas to power their cars and even motorcycles? The ""twist"" didn't gel with the rest of the movie. I only gave 2 stars instead of one because the fight and action sequences were well shot and edited along with the cinematography.SPOILER ALERTAt least the intentions of Gary Oldman's character of wanting to use the bible to control the masses was a breath of fresh air because it rings true to how most fanatical Christians were... still are. And if the bible is what caused the war that lead to the apocolypse, how then can the last surviving copy help and save the rest of mankind? Too many holes in the story."
1,It was the worst!!,Seriously!??!! This movie sucked!! The only reason why anyone liked this film was because there was a bible in it. I feel a great deal of shame for Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman.
2,Eh.,"If you really get excited about post-apocalyptic ambiance, and just need a spiritual stroll through the wasteland, this is your film. However, if you're looking for something with a deeper plot and better story, look elsewhere (this is nowhere near a Mad-Max type film and leans more towards the... born-again."
4,Denzel Does It All Well...a Perfect Eli,Though science fiction is not something I often watch or read. I found it interesting to watch. I liked it.
3,;0/,It was ok for me I love Denzel but this did not wow me I don't want to give anything away because everybody before me gave brief or long description of the movie when I found out out what the book was I was saying to myself are you serious this is what they were fighting for for power but I guess it would make sense but don't get me wrong it's still watchable but for me personally it was just ok.
5,Just Plain Good!,"This is a movie that just makes you think and wonder in a good way. I haven't seen a Denzel Washington movie in a long time that was not well acted. This is a story about a man after some sort of holocaust that has a book he believes he is ""destined"" to deliver to the right place. Not my typical interpretation of man with a ""mission from God""; but, if you believe He's spoken directly to you how do you not deliver? The movie does not preach, or I didn't perceive it to. Only part I didn't like is that the first 10 or 20 minutes of film is so dark (as in night with no lights) that I had difficulty understanding what was actually happening. I'm glad I bought it and can watch it several times to make sure I got all of the message it is trying to send."
4,Liked it,"Nice story line, good action, held my attention, I could watch it again if a few months and enjoy it all over again."
5,Customer review,"The Book of Eli is a a movie that may have you wonder, ""what the world may be like if worldwide a natural or human disaster occurred?"" Which may make you automatically think about the strain we put on the earth, as well as, the recent natural disasters that have plagued our planet approximately for a decade now. The cast played the movie as if times were ""lost"" and really makes you feel all of the emotions that come and go throughout the unorthodox scenes. As always I feel like a movie that has Denzel Washington in the mix usually has a hidden message, or a lesson to be learned. Just one of the lessons that was assummed throughout, and at the end movie, that should be practiced throughout our lives daily is: ""Never judge a book by its cover."""
1,trash for the left behind nutters,"Fundamentalist propaganda plain and simple. Certainly destined to be a true ""cult"" movie.Honestly, ALL the christian bibles were destroyed?!?! Get real, apparently the writers/directors/actors never stayed in a hotel or heard of the gideons.If you really want to own this movie, just wait. it will be in the bargain sections for $4.99 or less very soon.Has anyone else noticed the numerous duplicate five star reviews? That should certainly tell you something, don't fall for it."
1,bummer...insulting...small...so glad we can do it.,"Provocative from the beginning, disgusting, filthy, violent, brutal, primitive and insultingly simplistic. I am so glad we have he freedom to make trash like this, and that I was able to view it and to write what I think about it; I'd not have it any other way. Freedom of speech is so important to all of us...however...this film is a joke.It seems to have been designed for those with the smallest of brains (and penises) and greater interest in war and conflict...than peace and understanding.I can see this as a sort of twilight zone episode, if it were tweaked a little, but this is too severe and caustic for my senses...far too thin to be of what the bible speaks of or what it has spawned in man and culture. I did not find much here of any value."
5,Simply Grand,This is one of the most wonderful post apocalyptic stories I've ever seen. It tells the story in a simple manner yet leaves it riveted to the mind. The story of a man on a mission and how he encounters the many obstacles along the way. The setting and scenery seem grim but as the story unfurls it grabs your attention and you can even manage some laughs. As usual Denzel Washington plays the role to the T.
4,this ones good give it a try,This movie is great in my opinion and I am not a curch going person but I believe people need something to believe in this movie was more about a purpose driven man.and The movie is about the bible.yes. but its not preachy.not at all. like people seem to think. I tell you this movie rocks. if it was preachy i proboably wouldnt have watched it. I loved this movie Give it a try at least you can say you have seen it and can give your own opinion ..I tell ya its proboably not at all what you think.
1,No Product Info,Please give us some information about this product.What Region is it?How many discs?What's so special about this set?German language on the box... German language on the film?Throw us a bone!PLEASE!!!
5,My Daughter Loves Zoboomafoo!!!!!!,Okay so my daughter now 4 loves animals. We found this show one day channel surfing and ever since she needs to watch it everyday. Well we had a routine at 7pm but this year we can't find them anywhere. She learns so much about the animals and their living and eating habits it is amazing. If she loves it I gotta have it! So we bought the whole first season. Excellent in my book!!!! The guys are so happy and funny and very informative.
3,Understanding bird body language,"I was disappointed with the packaging, the DVD case was broken when it reached me in Australia. Heidenreich clearly knows her subject, however I would have liked to have seen better editing and heard better audio on the DVD. It was sometimes difficult to follow. Perhaps a couple of repeat examples would be beneficial."
5,The 80's are all right.,"This is a wonderful DVD, with some amazing performances. No one can dismiss that Trevor Horn is the best producer around and knows his stuff. Some of the better performances are from Seal, Yes and other less known bands/artists from the other side of the pond. Most comical moment for me? The the 2nd lead from Frankie Goes to Hollywood (Paul Rutherford) exposing a gut that had maybe one too many pints from the 80's. But, the ""new"" lead singer of FGTH was interesting, though screechy unlike Holly Johnson's smoother delivery. Ahhh. It's all good. Just hearing all the music that Trevor's touched is distinctly there and a joy to watch as it's performed live. You're not going to get the crazy rawk n' roll frenzy of say, a Stones or Springsteen concert (Let's face it, the Prince of Wales is watching - so no stage diving), but performances from ABC and the Pet Shop Boys did manage to rile up some English boogie-ing. Rawk on, Trevor Horn. Rawk on."
5,Absolutely Fantastic Concert,"Quite a few years ago, I took a closer look at the albums that I considered to be my ""favorite"" music. It turns out that many of them were produced by Trevor Horn. So I was very excited when I found this concert DVD, and it didn't disappoint. The concert features bands that I have liked for a long time, and also some music I hadn't heard before. While I was disappointed that Holly Johnson was not the lead singer for Frankie Goes to Hollywood in this concert, they still sounded great. I expect to be playing this DVD for years to come."
5,A fun & interesting must-read for all Groucho/comedy fans,"While visiting a friend about ten years ago, I happened to pull a copy of ""The Groucho Letters"" from his bookshelf. After thumbing through it, and reading several letters, I new I needed to own the book. I looked for it every now and again at various bookstores over the years, but could never find it. I did find it at Amazon.com (excuse the gratuitous bootlicking). It was worth the wait. This book is an engrossing look into the private thoughts of perhaps the century's greatest comedic thinker and communicator."
5,Superior Service,"This was my first ""Amazon Experience"". Like most potential Amazon users, I was a ""nervous Nellie"", however, I was pleasantly surprised by the efficient service and the quality of the goods I received. I feel confident to continue using Amazon, whenever the need arises."
2,Give us the 3D blu ray!,"The movie itself was great as usual. The jackass guys still know how to entertain. 5 STARS for the movie. But listen I shelled out alot of money to have a nice 3D tv, then I had to buy the glasses, then the 3D blu ray player, and a 3D hdmi cord. If you want people to spend money on all this then you have to.start releasing movies in 3D. Listen I get what the thinking behind the old school 3d. Some people like a trip down memory lane, but why not release both.I mean hell you took the time and money to release it in theaters in 3D, why not give us fans who couldnt make it to the theaters to see it, a chance to watch it."
2,Misleading!!,I am set up with a 3d TV and ps3. I own a few Blu Ray 3d titles and did Blu Ray 3d search. This came up with a preorder release date. IT IS NOT a 3d Blu Ray. It is a normal Blu ray and a regular dvd with the cheezy blue and red glasses. Gave 2 stars because Amazon return process was great. Full refund with shipping paid by them.
3,Pam Sl,"It was quite funny, but nothing could be as funny as the skit with the arabs in the previous Jackass Movie. My Mom is 84 years old and she loves to watch these movies. She will never get over the skit with the Arabs."
1,3D Really? Very Misleading!,"Not what I expected, I didn't open it yet because I am thinking of returning it. It was advertised as 3D but it's not made for new 3D technology. Although the title states Anaglyph 3D most people can confuse the description and be misled to think they are purchasing a 3D compatible DVD to use on their 3D TV and 3D Blue-ray player. I guess I would maybe have kept it anyway if they at least sent the cheap old school 3d glasses that the package states comes with it, but it didn't. I thought it was a deal at $18.99 which it looks like it just dropped to $17.99, but the price is irrelevant if your not getting what you think your paying for."
3,Way too much penis!!,"If you love penis, this is the movie for you. They need to seriously make a movie out of just Knoxville dressed up as the old man screwing with people. The bit where he was making out with his granddaughter was hilarious. Why do they all have to be so gay though?? I'm surprised they didn't give each other handjobs, then start laughing hysterically. Watch Jackass 3 if you love penis.....and poop.......and vomit."
1,Whats The Point!!!?!!!,"If the Blu Ray had been 3d I would of give it 5 stars but why, why why why a 3d dvd for gods sake? If you own a 3d tv surely you own a 3d Blu Ray player or why else would you bother!!!"
1,"important question, this is a 3d blu ray of jackass 3 o just a blu-ray whitout 3d","important question, this is a 3d blu ray of jackass 3 o just a blu-ray jackass 3 whitout 3d????"
1,"NOT IN the 3D you EXPECT, what a ripoff","Who would pay for the 1970's red/blue glasses 3D of any movie??Much less a movie that is a recent 3D release when people who have 3D Bluray. In the day where current releases labeled ""3D Bluray"" I don't expect to get a movie labled ""3D Bluray disc"" which was created this old 1970's format and put 4 pair of the cardboard red/blue glasses in the box!Were they too cheap and figured that if they just rolled it out with this type of 3D that everyone would buy it thinking it's current technology and not return it?This is a joke, glad I didn't open it, it's going back today. The current technology 3D is available on PPV on DirecTV if you own a 3DTV, so hopefully people will avoid this version like the plague and hope for a proper 3D Bluray!"
4,Loved it!,"I greatly enjoyed this book and had a hard time putting it down. I had previously read ""The Fifth Sacred Thing"" and liked it, but treated it as an interesting fantasy with characters too close to perfection for me to relate to. ""Walking to Mercury"", on the other hand, had characters that were portrayed as being more flawed and human in a way that I could empathize with. While I wouldn't call it great literature, ""Walking to Mercury"" was a highly enjoyable read that may have even taught me a thing or two."
5,Stunning.,"It took me a bit to get into the flow of the novel. There are three levels of narrative in the book, and two of them - The Camera Eye and Newsreel - are positively Joycean. On top of that, the narratives about individual characters - the most detailed of the three levels - are written so that once you get to know a character, Dos Passos introduces a new character (there are 4 total) in a new narrative. It can be a little exhausting at times.Once I got past that, the richness of the language and brilliance of the story became evident. His style is simple, somewhat similar to Steinbeck's, and reflects the ""common man"" quality of the people he has created. But his scope is far greater than that of any of his contemporaries. It is truly a work of genius. Dos Passos, through 1000 pages (of all 3 volumes) and a dozen main characters, has managed to accruately tell the story of a coming-of-age United States in a human, compelling way."
4,Tells the Story of a True American Hero well,"To Hell and Back tells the story of Audie Murphy, the most decorated American soldier in WWII. It also traces the combat history of the 3rd Infantry Division. As a former member of this division, I greatly appreciated the movie, and the sacrifice made by these fine men. They truly accomplished great things under great difficulty.As far as Audie Murphy goes, he is a legend in the Army, and rightfully so. This movie does a nice job of telling his story, and includes some great action scenes. The fact that he plays himself actually works well. I watched it with my two boys, and they both enjoyed it. Other than the violence of the combat scenes, I think it is suitable for kids.If you like vintage WWII films (this one was filmed in 1955), then you will enjoy To Hell and Back. Makes me proud to have served in the 3rd ID."
2,Great movie,"I love this movie as I have seen it many times. Audie Murphy did a great job in playing himself, although it must have been really hard to relive.A movie that I would highly recommend."
1,save your money,"This was an interesting listen, but gave little or no real tools that the listener can use in real life to create self esteem. Some ideas that I'd heard from Myss in the past. I listened and then donated my copy to the local library. Luckily i bought a used copy. I was happy i hadn't spent the $30 retail price that it sold for at my local health food store."
3,This Is NOT Paradise,"Wow! I feel like raters are being paid to dope this album! I'm a LR fan, but I'll stick to his Commodore style offerings if this is what his later products sound like. This is a mixed bag of 2 and 3 star songs, at best; Lionel whines his way through, almost, every song and the background vocals repeating the title to several songs is just bad (no other way to say it). The Stars of this album are the musicians, not Lionel; the music is very good; I would have liked for many of the songs to, simply, be instrumentals. There a few decent songs on here (Now You're Gone, Lovers At First Sight) and if Lionel had been patient for better songs, he would have succeeded. But he tried to pass off a bunch of wannabe Marvin Gaye songs; Earth to Lionel - You're NOT Marvin Gaye."
4,Very powerful Read,I enjoyed this book eminsly. Highly Recomend this tyo anyone want to try to understand why The USA was attacked.
1,Waste of time,This is a bad program designed to fatten Intuit and leave the purchaser with little of value. I have used Quickbooks for many years but i am sick of Intuit and its greedy business practices. Impossible to download data even with a QIF to OFX conversion program.
1,Don't start,"I have been using Q for close to 20 years. Once you have that much data in it, it's hard (or at least scary) to switch to a new program. Everytime I send Q upgrade money I keep hoping they will fix the bugs. The worst ones being data corruption. Q stores all your data in a database. Unfortunately there db design is also about 20 years old and gets corrupted. When it gets corrupted it's bad, you can loose data, funny things will happen (transactions lost, bad totals, duplicate entries). It happens to me about every 4-6 months. Being aware of this I backup Q every couple of days.Tech support very bad. Intuit uses it as a revenue stream. You get free online and email. But the answer usually is ""this is to complicated for email please call 1-800-India""; Have your credit card ready $25/each.I don't like the MS Money interface; I hate Quicken but I am still using it."
4,Not quite the old Harry,"When I went to see Harry Connick Jr. in concert, I was surprised by his new style. I am a devout fan of his old Frank Sinatra-like music. Though this cd is nothing like his earlier more jazz focused work, it is a pleasant compilation of songs that hightlights Connick's musical versatility. Expect rock style, and you won't be disappointed."
2,Very revealing dress,Very thin material for absolutely perfect figure.dress is very open and extremely short.That can be good for some hollywood night clubs or tet-a-tet dinner with you life partner.Most of boyfriends would not let you wear it in public
5,Photoshop Elements 5 - The Missing Manual,"This is the most comprehensive ""manual"" for Photoshop Elements 5 that I have seen. I looked at ""Classroom in a Book"" (Adobe)- good, and ""The Photoshop Elements 5 Book"" by Scott Kelby - better but the ""Manual"" is best. It is written in simple to understand terms. I would recommend it for beginners. Advanced users can use ""The Manual"" as a reference."
5,"Excellent, Lesion Oriented, very clear and understandible",I have used the original syllabus by Dr. Young many years ago. This text derives from the course syllabus at Saint Louis University Medical school. This book will provide you with deep and lasting understanding of clinical neuroanatomy. Excellent source for Neuroanatomy courses and the USMLE.
2,"Not bad, but...","it is an unnecessary remake of the 1976 film. Lee Remick and Gregory Peck were magical stars and the new ""stars"" lack their authorothy and star quality.True the killing scenes are inventive, but so what???This is only a reharsh of the not so-old-film and when u don`t have anything NEW to add to a story, why DO IT AT ALL???Liev Schreiber also filled Laurence Harvey`s shoes in The Manchurian Candidate and did a poor job in that 1 also... It`s ok if he wants to be a remake-hero, but it`s nothin`to build a career on....Mia Farrow excells in this 1(naturally 1 thinks of Rosemary Woodhouse and that indeed the Devil did take a hold on her hehehe), but her departure is ridiculous....As a matter of fact.... it doesn`t leave much excitement nor thrills and u m a y go back and see thr original. As a matter off fact......... DO!!!"
3,Demon-Boi,"Beautifully photographed, produced and designed with an artistic eye, this new version of ""The Omen"" saga, though scarier than the original, is not a success though Liev Schreiber's Robert Thorn, the excellent as usual David Thewlis as photographer/reporter David Jennings and the formidable Mia Farrow as Mrs. Baylock do their level best to add class and sophistication to the proceedings.The basic story is that the anti-Christ (a dull, Seamus-Davey Fitzpatrick) is back on Earth and looking to take it back for the devil. There is the requisite mumbo jumbo, garroting, beheading and such: most of it done on a very high level of ingenuity and gut-level, sickening brutality.Acting wise the main problems are the limp, emotionless, icy Katherine Thorn of Julia Stiles and the seemingly clueless, poorly directed and woefully miscast anti-Christ Damien of Fitzpatrick. And when the child of the Devil is boring in a film about itself, what have we got?"
1,Why waste my time with this remake?,"I never thought much of the original Omen. I found it long and dull. This movie is exactly the same. Generally when you remake a movie you do so to add things that maybe couldn't be done thrity years ago; you add special effects, you modernize language and style, you clean up the rough edges of the film. This remake does none of that. It is the exact same movie with new people. (And Julia Styles is a terrible actress.) The Omen 666 is reminiscent of the Psycho remake with Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche...they add NOTHING to the originals."
3,"Good attempt, but the original is much better.","John Moore's attempt at The Omen remake was acceptable, but there were flaws. Firstly and most importantly, it wasn't scary. Moore seemed to try too hard in making the movie scary by adding in cheap scares here and there. Secondly, it WAS true to the original but not an improvement. The only change of improvement was the death scenes that were highly exaggerated and gory. And lastly, the acting is pretty solid but not convincing enough to make the audience believe that Damien is truely evil.The Omen is still only a good film and an amateur remake. See it, but only if you must."
5,Hard Driving Rage !,"Probably my favorite album from this incredible band. Heck, all of their albums are great, I cannot really think of another band with the consistency as Mike Ness and the boys. What I like so much about this album is how hard it is. This album kicks off with a rockin' # and just keeps driving the pace and sound up up up. Mike Ness, you freaking rule!"
5,THE FIRST,"The fisrt singer in Brasil cover cd whit all name SIMONE BITTENCOURT DE OLIVEIRA OR ONLY S I M O N E , HITS, FANTASTIC SELECTION, THE BEST OF BRASILIAN MUSIC.CD FROM 1995."
2,Bought 2' both strings broke in less than a week,"Had high hopes for Duncan brand. Bought one for each of my 2 boys age 10 and 11. Both strings broke in less than a week. After taking them apart, it seems you need a special string with a fabricated looped end to fix it. Not worth it in my opinion."
3,Not the best yoyo for tricks,If you are hopeing to do insane tricks or even a decent sleeper DO NOT BUY THIS YOYO it is hard to do sleepers and even other tricks just buy a different yoyo
2,Misrepresented,"The ""small print"" says that the actual color may be different. Well, the style of what I was sent was different, too. If I could return this yoyo easily, I would."
4,almost perfect collection of all their top 100 billboard hits,"Every top 100 hit is here, as well as remixes. Problem is, they left off the 12"" version of Room to Move, which would have made this a complete final chapter in the recording history of this band in its two lineups. And if space was an issue, they coul have removed the ""12 inch remix"" of Obsession, which I believe was remixed a year or so later. The original album version included on this disc (5:35) is actually the ""long"" version. The remix (7:32) is overmixed and takes away the sexy feel of the original. Other 12"" versions are Let Him Go (6:04) (good 12""), I Want you (6:49) (good 12""), and I Engineer (10:57) (a little long for a generally uninteresting song). Also note that the 7"" version of Let Him Go is used on here--it has more synths thant the original album version, which was guitar heavy."
5,Five Stars!!,"In an election year, a book like this can make even a liberal question their own political views. Whether you are a liberal or a conservative, this book is meant to outline a political belief. And even if you agree or disagree with this book's message, Smith has given us some food for thought, and presents his point thoroughly and precisely."
1,More Marketing Than Chris,"I mean no disrespect to Mr. Reeve, but he could not have written this book. If he dictated the book to someone it does not show it. While I was reading it I was trying to find Chris Reeve's voice, but I think I found his editor's voice instead. The book is more about marketing Chris Reeve than having him tell his story and because of this I can't say the book is worth reading."
1,Book Is Impossible,"I have read this book and I can say that it is impossible for Chris Reeve to write a good book. Never have I seen such an attempt to market a book based on misguided publicity efforts, instead of a good story. It was depressing."
4,"Slightly Disappointed, but Ultimately Pleased","I am a pretty big fan of Josh Kelley's, so I was excited for his second CD to come out. Being a fan, I wanted to love it! While I don't love it, I don't hate it either...I was worried because at first listen I was only drawn to a couple songs, but after a couple listens (while this second effort may be a bit more glossy and pop-like), there is definately a chunk of songs that I like (some I love).The critical side of me says, I wish he took a different route, or expiramented more somehow, but it's not a bad effort. No masterpiece, but still a solid effort which I can respect. I think most Josh fans will love it, and if you're not, it could go either way. I say atleast give it a try...ya never know.Memorable Songs (my personal favs): ""Walk Fast"", ""Only You"", ""Lover Come Up"", and ""Hard Times Happen""Song to Forget About: ""Lydia"". Sorry Josh, ya lost me on that one; a horrible song."
2,kind of sucked,This album was kind of bad. This is my first CD owned by Next and I wanted to try them out because i liked Wifey and Too Close. I was extremely disappointed by this album. I wasn't really feeling most of the songs. Other than the two songs I liked I did enjoy Butta Love and Splash. After the fifth song the CD became really boring to me. I didn't like the fact that on one track some guy was calling women hoes and b*tches. This was not overall a good R&B; album. The songs were not appealing to me and half of the CD began to seem dull and bland. This was definately a disappointment and this will be my one and only CD purchase by Next. I felt like I wasted my money.I do not recommend this CD. If you want some real R&B; try:Dru Hill-Greatest HitsDonnell JonesJagged Edge-HeartbreakTyrese
4,Great bang for the buck,"I read all of the reviews here before ordering a refurbished unit. Concerns about the LCD display are NOT well-founded. Contrast IS adjustable (though the default setting is way too dark for some reason).The ergonomics of the unit are OK--certainly could be better, but I really like being able to handle this unit easily in one hand. I used to have the full size Sony beast and would never go back. This one does everything I need. I especially like the Tivo implementation. For $35 refurbished I'm happy as can be."
1,DDR DVD game,"I was so excited to get this game in the mail but my excitement quickly grew into frustration when I realized that this game is not the real DDR. I wish I would have known because I would have never ordered it. The mats are fake and the game is not very challenging compared to the real DDR. I'm sure that young kids would enjoy it but for those over 12 it seems to stink in comparison to the real thing. What a bummer. My impression of this game when it first came out was that it was going to be exactly the same thing as playing it on PS2 or some other game system and I was so excited that someone finally thought to do it. However, my expectations were too great because the DVD DDR is just not real."
1,disrespectful hatchet job,"Rachel Carson so loathed this film that she neveragain sold the rights to her books................-- and with schlockmeister irwin at the helm, it's no wonder --after suffereng through the initial heavy handed attempts atproselytising, the viewer is treated to a thematicallyconfused 60 minutes that veers mindlessly fromgawking at the under water 'freaks' togee whiz, look at the variety of life tohey, let's kill some helpless sea creatures for 'sport' --building to a climax, we are entertained by a mass killing ofking crabs (an infinitesimal preview of things to come)and for the finale we are treated to the blow by blow slaughterof a whale -- as the screen fills with blood (and the viewerwith revulsion) we see in no uncertain terms the true natureof man's 'stewadship' of this planet --..........shame on the producers -- if they had wanted to make a filminsulting everything Rachel Carson stood for , they coulldn'thave done a better job"
4,Easland Newport,"I have always found this particular brand and styling of shoe comfortable. I probably should have purchased a wide rather then the normal width. But overall I am generally very happy with this shoe, just need to wear thin socks and I hope they break in quickly. I have purchased the brown ones in the past and they seemed more comfortable for some reason on the inside (???)!It's been a number of years though since I purchased this type of shoe. The only thing I can think of is perhaps the materials are slighty different now. Just seems ALOT stiffer. Where as the previous ones felt so comfortable right out of the box."
1,Shoe was too narrow for me,"I purchased this shoe in the usual size I take in Eastland shoes and I could hardly get my foot into the shoe. Once on, with the use of a shoehorn, the shoe was long enough but too tight overall. Too uncomfortable on, it was immediately apparent they had to go back. Disappointed as the shoe is good looking and I have had very good luck with Eastland shoes otherwise. Plus had to pay return shipping. :("
2,"Good, but...","I've owned 3 pair of these shoes. Comfort is great, good support, roomy toe box and easy to get on and off. But the soles and heel crack and split long before the leather uppers show wear. The inside lining material wears and becomes shabby quickly. I would pay twice the price for better quality for a longer wear. The design is great but the material inside and the sole/heel is inferior. I'd buy again IF the price reflects the material quality."
3,Clunky shoes,"I used to wear this Newport style a lot several years ago. But had forgotten about them until I was searching for some comfortable shoes with support to wear during my third trimester of pregnancy. This pair ended up being too large (slipped in the heel), but I would have returned them even if they had fit because they are too clunky for my style now."
2,Not the same quality as before,"I, too, had the same shoe for years but the material at the top was starting to wear so I replaced it with this new shoe. The new shoe was not as comfortable at first, but after time has become more comfortable. After just over a year, I, too, have had the same problem with this replacement pair as other reviewers. The bottom of the shoe has split on both shoes. This is very troubling since my previous pair lasted for years with much more wear."
1,Starship Troopers? Not.,"Bischoff may be right that you'll like this book if you liked the Starship Troopers movie. But just as the Starship Troopers movie was a pale imitation (almost a parody) of the book, Bischoff's book is a pale imitation of the Alien movies. As for comparing himself to Heinlein or Haldeman, that's a joke. This is pulp fiction at its mindless worst. Avoid."
5,A must read for all who wear braids or locks.,"I first read this book, four years ago. I was amazed by the beauty of the models, the recipies for hair products and the indepth explaination of what happens to our hair when we alter the struc ture of the hair. This is the book that I have my students read. Teaching basic braiding at P.G.C.C. with the help of this book has given potential braid techs and potential braid customers a chance to get a better understanding of their hair. Thank you Pam. Marci Walker Mme Wlkr's Braidery"
3,Natural Hair,The book gives wonderful details on what type of products or ingredients to use or avoid on natural hair. She also goes into great detail to tell how to care for the natural hair. The only thing that I hated was that she didn't specify which type of products would be helpful.
5,A neat collection,"This book is great. It shows most of the Peanuts strips for the year of 1992. It has some awesome strips, like the one where it shows Marcie without her glasses, something I had never seen before(her eyes look just like everybody else's). The only complaint that I have is that it doesn't show most of the Sunday strips in the year. But other than that, this book is a great collection for any Peanuts fan!"
4,HCI Helmet,Item received much earlier than expected. Outstanding service by Jafrum - would recommend them to everyone. Helmet is a good buy for the price.
3,LBJ Years,This is the 3rd of the 4 volume set...I think I would skip this one actually if I had limited time. It is pretty much a rehash of the other two books. It could be a text book for political manipulation if most of the things he did weren't illegal!!
5,Fascinating Biography,"If you only read a single book in your life, this one should be it. If you only read two books in your life, this one should be both of them.I used to wish that I could stay alive long enough to find out the identity of Deep Throat, now I hope that I can survive long enough to have the privilege to read Caro's final volume on Lyndon Johnson.The story of Johnson is totally fascinating. A man without any sign of a moral compass, with an unsurpassed desire for raw political power and who once he had achieved his life's goal (the presidency of the United States) used that power largely for the good of the American people. Johnson was responsible for the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the enactment of a single payer, government run health program (Medicare), one of the most successful and popular entitlement programs ever.Read all three volumes and read them in order. Your life and your understanding of politics will be much the richer for it."
1,Asking Price for this Superb Book is Out of Line,"This book is simply outstanding, best ever written on Presidential Power - bar none. So - why only one star? The same book is available from Amazon for less than $15.00. So why pay $69 (the asking price as of this writing)?? The cover is different, so this may be an early printing. That alone does not warrant an additional $54."
4,I Can't Get Enough of the Urth/LongSun/ShortSun saga,"Many have compared this to Homer's Odyssey. On retrospect I would agree. This book continues Horn's story and adventures on the planet Blue. What I like about Wolfe is that from any point in time you not only go forward but backward. As he reveals Horn's future we continue to learn more and more about his past. What we thought we already read and understood in the Long Sun books is further explained, questioned and explored. Like peeling the layers of an onion Wolfe keeps us hooked looking towards the future and the past.I am currently reading In Green's Jungles and can't wait for Return to the Whorl. Once finished I'll probably go all the way back to the Book of the New Sun and reread all three series in order. You can never reread Wolfe enough. You will always find more nuggets."
2,Disappointingly Dense,"I found this book disjointed and disappointingly dense. I felt like the story started somewhere in the middle and even after reading about a quarter of the book I did not identify with any of the characters or find myself involved in the plot line. Rare for me, but I could not get myself to finish the book. Be prepared to fight your way through if you purchase this book."
3,Be very very cautious!,"As per another review in the listing... I have seen Intuit literally ruin this product by releasing versions of Quicken that, quite frankly should have never been release. I can tolerate the bugs in Turbo Tax (as it is a very time sensitive releast) - but based on all the bugs that they have had to fix on version 5 (they are on their 4th update... and it's not even a year old - one of which states when you go to their troubleshooting web page that there is a know error of which there is no fix or go around, and will be fixed with the next release, so you can have THEIR mistake fixed for 60 bucks). Also, trying to get a live person will cost you money, a long distance charge as there is no 800 number, and a hold time of 30 minutes or longer. Quicken used to be an outstanding product... I hope someday they will return to their roots!"
1,Why does Quicken survive?,"After using MS Money for years and wondering if Quicken had something more, I took the leap and purchased Quicken Premier.After using the product for a few weeks, I can tell you that Microsoft is the hands-down winner for personal finance products. Quicken's interface is absolutely horrid! Moving from field to field for data entry is cumbersome, it can't reconcile my simple portfolio, and doesn't conform to standard key shortcuts. Data entry is an absolute miserable experience.While Money eliminates most of the headaches around financial management, Quicken amplifies them....If you're using Money, do not switch! If you're using Quicken, believe me, there is a much better product out there!I will be taking advantage of Quicken's 100% satifisfaction policy and returning this product ASAP!"
1,Wow...This is truly a bad product,Before you buy this and think you will download all the information from your bank and 401K information check to make sure they don't use QIF files; because if they do you will be stuck will a $60 coaster for you end table as the program will be worthless to you.Customer service is terrible and the product is a complete waste of time!BEWARE!
5,are good and long,are good and just long for what I needed excellent buy shipping was very fast and are elastic and hard as they wanted as
5,Very Fun,"I love how the anticipation builds up in this book, as Dora and friends prepare for Isa's surprise party. My 16 month old daughter has had this book for about 4 months, and she continues to like it more and more. She gets excited when Isa comes through the door and then again when the pinata breaks. Like other Dora books, a little bit of spanish is incorporated, and Dora asks questions. There are so many objects for children to point out in all the Dora books."
2,BMW Classic Motorcycles,Just a thin pocket size handbook of a few BMW models over the years. Thankfully it was a give away price so couldn't complain.
4,Wake Island,An interesting film about a little known battle in the Pacific during WWII. The facts were pretty well shown as to the desperate fight the troops had during the beginnings of WWII and the Japanese expansion of their empire.
3,Realistic study of brave men in War...,"""Wake Island"" is a battle for a small atoll in the Central Pacific Ocean west of Honolulu, which was attacked by the Japanese on December 7, 1941, hours after Pearl Harbor... The small U.S. marine garrison held out until the Japanese overran the island on December 23...It is a story of sacrifice of the gallant and doomed defenders, movingly portrayed by William Bendix, Robert Preston, Brian Donlevy, MacDonald Carey and others... The battle scenes are chillingly photographed in Black and White, and the movie blows the clarion call for a new heroism... It is the 'Alamo of the Pacific,' the cry of 'Remember Wake Island,"" with the same stirring effects as 'Remember the Alamo,' one hundred years previously...Well done within its limits, the film bears the unmistakable stamp of truth, and hails as a realistic portrayal of brave men in war..."
2,Trashy,"This book is about music and sex. The observations about music are interesting (to a musical neophyte like me), but the sexual content is dated, clunky, embarassing. Overall, the book is little better than the usual trashy bestseller with none of the skill and insight of Steps or Being There."
2,To much exposition,Kosinski has the bad habit of 'Telling' instead of 'Showing'.Instead of the characters voices we get the narrator telling us what is said. Whole conversations are told instead of letting the reader hear the characters and let them live on their own. This got to be way to much for me and although the premise is cool and it ends on a good note (why hasn't this been made into a movie?) the book suffers from a bad case of overwriting.
1,Does not perform,"This holster for the LG Chocolate is totally inadequate. It fails in it's ease of use, it is difficult to operate the phone/music player with the case on. It also fails in its primary purpose, which is to hold and protect the cell phone. The phone falls out of the case, I think through the opening intended to operate the round control. I do not recommend this product."
3,Wrong dims,Listed as 38 cubic feet...WRONG! It is 3.8 cu/ftAlso it is listed as 171 inches long....WRONG AGAIN!!! Is is 27.8x21.7x20Check sentry safe for better specs
3,Not all information given,"This was a great product and in great condition. However, in the listing, it was not mentioned that this model also had a version number. It was incompatible with my hardware and therefore I had to return it."
3,"Card was great, but you can get an 11g cheap now","Two days after I received this card I spotted an 11g card for $20. Given that I had configured 11g encryption on my router and wasn't looking forward to re-configuring my whole network to use 11b encryption, I opted to spend another $20 for the 11g card. I gave away this card."
1,Sorry - another one bites the dust.,"I have tried (2) of these type of wireless adapters; one from Linksys and a second unit from another vendor, and both run for about two weeks, then fail. I think my laptop runs a little warm and this causes them to break. I would recommend an external unit that connects to the USB port."
3,wireless card,installation is easy but actual use by Win98 not so. My Compaq 1400 won't immediatly recognize it.
4,More addictive than anything else,"This game is fun but only to a point. It's really just another black hole for time. I was playing this several times, and next thing I knew it was sunrise. Yes, I'm ashamed of myself, which is why I threw the game away."
2,Disappointing,"I was thrilled when I finally got hold of a copy of this book, but it disappointed me bitterly. I don't understand why the other reviewers are raving about it. It's actually very tedious."
5,It's an unforgettable series,"I bought 2 seasen of Code Geass, but 1st seasen not yet arrived. But I started to watch 2nd seasen, because a few years ago I watched this series. And it became my best anime!!I didn'd have any expectation to English dub, but the Lelouch's voice acter in English worked very good. I usually liked Fukuyama Jun's voice as Lelouch and I thought any voice actor can't do Lelouch's voice. But, it was wrong. Well, I still like Jp voice acters.I want to mention about discs, they are beautiful!! Inside of case, there are 8 discs with different imagen. But, I had to take care of the discs to use...And I liked very much extras, too. It really one of best series for me!!"
5,great book series,"We are having an Arts and Humanities fair in our school district. Our high school kids read to the preschoolers on our campus. We also have a science room with an iguana and we want to bring our iguana Iggy to the fair and we wanted a book to read to the children. I remembered the Sweet Pickles books I read to my daughter, she is now 23. We loved those books. This is the perfect book about an iguana and I hope all the children at the fair will enjoy it as much as my daughter and I did years ago. Recommend it and all the Sweet Pickles Books. T"
5,"What happened to ""Sweet Pickles""!","I can't believe I can't find any ""Sweet Pickles"" books! My favorite thing as a child was to look at the map at the front of the book that showed the city and where every animal lived - and the pictures of the animals in alphabetical order! I love these books! I am going to have my first child and I wish I could find these books for him!"
5,I NEED THESE BOOKS!,"Ok! Like everyone else who has written a review here, I had this series as a child and they have been lost over the years. I came across a set in college that my professor of Psychology of Personality had and used in class. Very fitting I might add. I would love to be able to share these wonderful books about feelings with my own children. Maybe if enough of us write in and cry and beg we can get someone to bring them back. They really are a wonderful teaching set of books and I would love to have a set for my own children like I said before. PLEASE HELP ME FIND ONE! Thank you very much."
5,"Excelent, Just Perfect. The Best Christmas Purchase.","This was the best ""music"" purchase of the Christmas. I have a 15 years old daughter that is ""totaly crazy"" with this cd. She is a HannaManiac. A good CD for all the family."
4,Preteen Daughter loved it.,My [..]daughter is HUGE Miley Cyrus fan. She has worn out this CD and it has quickly become her favorite.
2,Play 4 chords and scream about girls...,"Thye learned to play one more chord after Hotter Than Hell. Seriously folks this another early KISS 35 min throwaway. The better songs on it are all on the live albumns which are far far superior in production quality than this. There is no reason to spend the money on this unlesss you are a big fan who HAS to have all the albumns. The production quality is as bad as most of the songs. I don't know about you but I can only listen to so many songs in which Gene and Paul make their sexual desires known to us over and over again. Once again the albumns of choice for this band are Alive, Destroyer and Love Gun. Also some of their 80's and 90's work is decent stuff but because of the changing lineups their sound was changing as well..."
3,Two Steps Foreward One Step Back,"Has much better production quality than the first two but not as many good songs. Highlights are Love Her All I Can, She, C'mon And Love Me, Two Timer and Rock And Roll All Night."
5,Third release - amazing,"Not only did this band back up the ingenious KISS debut with an excellent 'more of' the fun of Kiss album 'Hotter than Hell'. They followed the Sophmore effort with the '3rd times a charm'. This is my favorite of the Originals (Dressed to Kill). Get all three, and then top it off with Kiss Alive. This is all the music you will ever need."
3,Davey & Goliath Difficulties,"Davey & Goliath was always a favorite of ours growing up. We believed this would be an excellent purchase & for the most part it was. The first set, The Easter episode stopped working halfway through. We returned the set & reordered it, & it happened a 2nd time on The Easter episode & School Who Needs It? Seems the problems lie with the 30 minute special episodes. We kept the 2nd set & we fast forward when we get to the cut-off points. Kind of disappointing to pay that much money & have difficulties."
3,just okay,"I thought you'd be able to see the food thru the blue side so you know what you put in each bowl without taking them all apart.YOu have to work them a bit to get them to stay together. They don't just snap together right away.Also, the depth is almost deep enough, but another 1/3"" or more would make them a little better for storing your lunch meat, cheeses, etc. I have to move the meat around a bit & than squish the lid on, but I do buy the 1 lb bg instead of the small amounts. If they were just a little deeper, they could serve double duty to send as lunch containers for sandwishes. But... I am using them for what I bought them for, so it's not all that bad."
3,It's authentic! But...,"It is an authentic Tupperware. The item looks great. The size is very generous.It's just not as good as other traditional Tupperwares. The stackable seal of each box is very flimsy and tenuous. It comes off easily. In other words, it doesnt look it is very airtightly sealed to keep the coldcut deli meat fresh.Other than that, the seller has been great with customer service and quick service."
3,Library Journal has it just right,"BHaBU is a very uneven collection of essays. To LJ's criticisms I would add one more -- which the author himself notes at the outset: there is an enormous amount of repetition in this already short book. To be sure, the science writing in BHaBU is, expectedly, quite interesting (hence, 3 stars). But many essays in BHaBU are little more than quasi-verbatim rehashings of other essays in the book. Overall, BHaBU feels more like a profit-seeking venture than the deliberate product of a conscientious author. And strong agreement with LJ: the last 'essay' in BHaBU -- the transcript of a radio interview -- is pure filler. Very annoying, I thought."
1,"Cashing in on ""A Brief History""","Hawking's best known book ""A Brief History of Time"" is one of the classics of it's type, managing to get across the essential elements of some very complex science in a simple manner. Unfortunately this is not in the same league and appears to be a shameless attempt to cash in on the Hawking name by lashing together a collection of old essays and a radio script. There is a LOT of material which will seem very familiar to readers of ""A brief history"" and a lot of repetition even between the different essays in the book. Very disappointing - lots of recycled science - and anyone looking for an insight into Hawking himself rather than his work would be better to look at John Gribbin's excellent ""Stephen Hawking - A Life in Science""."
3,Great for passports. Not wide enough for 8 1/2 x 11 itinerary,"I like that it's zippered but unfortunately the pockets can only hold paper that is about 8"" wide, so I had to cut off the sides of my itinerary for it to fit in the pockets. That was the only thing I didn't like about it, but still it's kind of an important thing!"
3,Mainstream Mystery,A quick no nonsense story. Lsitened to audio CD and it made the time in the car go fast. Did not have to pay close attention as the story is pretty no frills.
2,Fairstein was in over her head on this one,"I've read all the Fairstein novels with Alex Cooper, so obviously I like them. But this one shows me Fairstein tried to do more complex plotting and failed. The story was convoluted, with too many characters all dealing with ancient (and rather boring) history.Unliike some of the other reviewers who couldn't finish the book, I did make myself finish, but I knew the ending was going to be dumb and anticlimactic. And I wasn't wrong.Not Fairstein's best work.P.S. Ms. Fairstein, Alex is interesting, but she's also very pretentious (i.e. ""the house in the country,"" etc.). And her relationship with Jake is almost romance-novel-like in the way it's described. (I.e., the ""I-want-my-lover-to-take-me-in-his-arms-and-make-me-feel-loved-and-adored"" crap.) Maybe tone down the pretentiousness and perhaps try to describe Alex's relationship in a less sappy way?"
2,A mess,"This book is a cliche-ridden mess, complicated and naive at the same time. Her prose is jerky. Smooth transition ? What is that ? Like so many crime authors who have made it she can't write at all. Why they are successful is beyond me. If you finished this book you are a masochist.Bill Doolittle"
1,hated it.,"I do not know why but i justed hated this book, i could not even finish it so i could not tell you what its about."
3,"Disappointing, compared to others in the series...","I'd guess that this is the fourth Fairstein novel I've read, and it is the least compelling. (""The Bone Vault"" was much better.) This time around, the plot is too full of coincidence and cliche and complications and CIA clones and coin collections. All those ""C"" words...hmmm...guess that's why I'd grade this one a ""C"". Fairstein knows the law and trial work and sex crimes from her pre-writing life, and in this book she tries to get away from what she knows best and show off her broader education. But the attempt is not really successful. Her heroine, Alex Cooper, is less likeable in this effort. I found her pretentious and whiny this time around, and in the earlier novels I liked her more."
1,total crap,"its like the monkees version 2.0...utter garbage. Its a bloody boy band that play thier own instruments! if you like music, dont bother, but if you like faux-rock with a poppy twist,enjoy wasting your 15 bucks on a future coaster..."
1,horrible,"this band is almost as bad as fallout boy. this album sucks do not buy it. i recommend terror state by anti-flag, or wolves in wolves clothing by nofx."
4,good music,"i really like the music from this CD. all the tunes have a great melody and catchy tunes. my absolute favorites are 'pop princess' and 'catch your wave'!! i first heard their music 2 months ago and i can't stop listening to it! if you like pop/rock music then you'll LOVe this cd. the only bad thing is that all of their songs sound somewhat alike, but that doesn't detract from the overall quality of the music."
1,de-evolution of pop,"A bloodsucking corporate version of power-pop. if you want new, good power pop played by guys in suits, check out the singles and their album ""better than before."""
1,UGH.,"Too bad the lowest score you can give is a 1, otherwise this would be about a negative 10 if possible. The lyrics are lame, and the songs are annoying. Just because they dress good, have nice hair, and are on MTV, doesn't mean they play good music. These guys just SUCK flat-out."
1,Click zero...,"Review for: Click 5Ages:7-10Instruments: GoodSingers: BadLyrics: R-E-A-L-L-Y bad!Related bands: Backstreet Boys, N'Sync,Good Charlotte. etc.Downside: Too many male groups sing about girl's who are bratty pop-stars or glittering drama queens,or how there girlfriends left them for another guy, this is one group, 1 down, 99 to go!Goodside: Change their lyrics, music style, and sense. Hey,they'd probably be good!Recommended groups & or singers: Michelle Branch, Hanson, Norah Jones, Avril Lavigne, Kelly Clarkson ...Not recommended groups & or singers: Hilary Duff, Lindsay Lohan,Britney Spears, Christina Agulaira, Backstreet Boys, N'Sync...Thanx!"
1,"""No"" Means No","'The more she ignores me, the more I adore her'- line from Just The Girl by Click FiveThis band. They wrote a song about some girl who doesn't want any of them. Not only does this girl not acknowledge their existence, but she also badly mistreats them. From the evidence, she clearly hates them. So then they took it upon themselves to stalk the living crap out of her.Now, I don't know what type of loser would make a song about harrassing a woman daily (hello, that's psychological abuse.)She doen't want to see you, stop calling her, stop following her.I swear, the personas in that song keep reminding me of teen sex ads: 'no' means no.This band is not good. The music is particularly bland and the lyrics for every song unsuitable for a legal adult to be listening to. This album is also laced with sugar-gone-bad ""guitar-work"". It's clear that the target audience for this tripe is young teenagers.Don't buy this album, it's annoying."
1,Funny,I love this band. Let me make sure I have got this right; five guys with very little musical talent but descent looks are put together by a big shot record producer to make music that 5 year old girls will love. The record producer then makes millions of dollars through this band that cares little about music but instead cares about the money and girls. I think I have heard this before.
2,Beware Buying Sayers Books -- Duplication Abounds,"Beware buying collections of Dorothy Sayers essays. She didn't write all that many, and most books are simply repackagings of the same essays under a different name -- like this book and ""Letters To A Diminished Church,"" which is not any ""letters"" at all but simply a few more essays than are contained here. If you have Letters there's no need to buy this book, which the publisher dishonestly wants you to think is chiefly concerned with Christian dogma. It is not. Some of the content is, other content is not."
2,It only scratches the surface...,"This movie was interesting, but didn't nearly have the impact as 9/11 mysteries or loose change. It shows the struggles of the 4 Jersey women in search of answers and the horrible job news media did in covering the story. But, it only scratches the surface and doesn't provides answers."
3,Doesn't go far enough...,This is a good movie which gently exposes the Truth of 9/11 but it does not cover the real conspiracy behind the crime.
3,Not as powerful as early bootlegs but a must-own,"This was the live album that changed the viability of official live recordings in the 70s. It also blew KISS up and cemented their popularity in the prevailing rock scene...it's just too bad much of this album was aurally ""photoshopped"" to present the perfect live experience. That being said, what is assembled here hits its mark. Deuce at the opening of the album arrives with pyro enhancement and deadly riffage that the studio original lacked. In the midst of 100,000 years, Paul Stanley goes evangelical in praise of rock and roll. Cold Gin roars away with ease...and RNRAN sounds better than ever."
5,Best kiss album known to mankind,"I don't think KISS ever got much better than this. They were hungry, raw, daring. They had a lot to prove and didn't have overwhelming egos. While this band has NEVER been for everybody, this is the album and music that inspired motley crue, poison, and all the other 80's glam bands. If you purchase only 1 kiss CD ever...I recommend this one. Listening to this live metal shredfest could make anyone dream of being on stage with these nuts. Awesome energetic music, and a great time. I recommend getting the mp3s so that you can edit out Paul Stanley's foolish banter."
5,THIS IS WHAT KISS IS ABOUT!!!,"This is the one by far...at least in my mind it is...this was before the commercialism set in and were the baddest band in the land...this album captures the essence of KISS,four young guys from New York rocking your brains out of your head!!! In fifty years people will look back and say ""Wow now that was a band baby!!"" KISS RULES!!!"
4,Actually a little too wide,"Purchased the coral (orange) color in a size 6EE. They are comfortable, but a little loose. I have other Easy Spirit Traveltime mules/clogs in the same size that fit better. I think it is due to the material they are made with, which is a little stretchy."
2,It is just not fun.,"I realized I did not like this game after spending 20 minutes pulling a target around on a string for no discernible reason. It may be pretty, but there is no fun. I play games for fun, and if there is no fun, it would be better to take a second job and make money doing something not fun. If you really want to get into this kind of game, search for alternate reality games."
4,"Works exactly as it should, Adorama shipped promptly","This does exactly what you would expect. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that it lacks a feature that I WISH it had: an offset threaded hole so that once I put it on my D80, I could leave it there and still be able to use it on a different tripod/head.Again, this is just nice thing I wish it had, but it works perfectly on Arca Swiss ball-heads."
1,NOT 'bare' wood as shown,"The yoyo pictured is clearly 'bare wood' with a stripe on it. The ad says the yoyo may NOT be the color offered. SO that infers either the wood is darker or lighter and/or the stripe may be blue or orange or what not.But when the yoyo got here 9 days and $5.00 later, it was a PAINTED yoyo. NOT what is represented.Because I searched long for this and this was the only company offering bare wood, I bought from this seller. Right now I await contact from them. Their phone number: ""does not accept calls at this time"" so I had zero luck s/w them.My point: buying from other sellers on Amazon is not the best idea. Sure this was a Duncan, but NOT what was shown."
4,The Promised Land,"It was a great series of lessons on the events in the Bible of Joshua leading his people into the promised land. It gave me some new insights of the land and its peoples and the plan God had for them. Only negative was that it only came with a leader guide. To use it for an adult bible class, I had to develop my own class handouts. Ray Vander Lann was excellent in his presentation. Highly informative!"
3,"A few Good Songs, worth the buy for KISS","I'm a big KISS fan (75-77 era) and although this isn't my fave record, it still has some good songs on it. The obvious rockers rule like ""I"" and ""The Oath"", but Ace (my fave) doesn't shine as much on this record . I've read that he was pretty bummed out on the direction KISS was taking on this record and I can see why. It's cheesy, the story is cheesy and it has a ""Queen's Flash Gordon Soundtrack"" feel to it in some ways. But honestly, i've always considered KISS ""comic book rock"" anyway, so this record is a nice Dungeons & Dragons rock attempt and so I like it for what it is."
3,Ain't as bad as all dat...,"Back in the vinyl days, the one thing this album had going for it was artwork; the inner gatefold looked like it belonged in a KISS song, if not an entire album. Still and all, an album as far removed from ""Dynasty"" and ""Unmasked"" as they are from ""Love Gun"", etc.It has its moments; ""I"", ""A World Without Heroes"" (featuring one of Paul Stanley's best solos), ""Dark Light"", and ""Escape From The Island"". But such efforts as ""Odyssey"" and ""Mr. Blackwell"" sink this concept album before it even has a chance to sink in.It's a mediocre pop album, and a semi-decent rock album. Does the remastering help matters? Not really--I've got a 15 year-old cassette version that sounds just as good on a decent deck. More's the pity, as ex-drummer Eric Carr believed the album only really needed a good mix."
3,A departure from Kiss' earlier sound and it's intriguing,"Losing its American fan base and original drummer, Kiss tried something different -- a concept album that bombed. It might have been ahead of its time as some say, others will say it was another gimmick by the band to create a ""larger than life"" persona. The album has its moments, with ""The Oath,"" ""I"" and ""Escape From The Island."" It's a must-have for all Kiss fans, but the average listener will have little or no use for it. It also features the worst cover on a Kiss album. The hidden track (No. 12) is classic."
4,KISS MEETS FLOYD,"I am one of those die-hard KISS fans (I even have a KISS tattoo) who happens to LOVE this album! In 1981, when it first came out, after the departure of original KISS drummer Peter Criss, to be honest, I thought it was just too non-KISS. But, over time, and especaily with the CD remastering, I find it to be one of my favorite KISS albums. My only disappointment with the album is the song DARK LIGHT. In my opinion, the song drags on too much, especialy the lead solo. I get the feeling that Ace Frehley did not give his all and this song proves that. I have heard both sides of the hate it/love it saga. One of my closest friends finds it to be an unrealistic KISS record. He owns it, but he never listens to it. As a KISS fan since 1976, I am glad they only did this once. Yet, still, I feel this albums shines."
3,"30 years on, The Elder has aged well","By the time KISS had released The Elder I had mostly moved on to other bands. My initial impression wasn't a good one. I thought that it didn't sound like a ""KISS album"" and dismissed it quickly. Three decades on I can honestly say that The Elder is actually a very interesting and largely enjoyable listen. It certainly is a departure from their signature sound and arguably a mis-step in their recording career. But what a mis-step! It's a highly creative and fascinating listen with many musical textures and styles that holds one's attention throughout. Who'd have thought I'd be shelling out money 30 years later for an album I blew off as ""terrible"" in my teenage years? Well, I have and am glad I did!"
1,The Elder [...],"What is this [...] This album is horrible! I love Kiss so don't think I'm one of those Kiss Haters but this album is just plain bad. It's hard to imagine the same band that gave us great albums like Destroyer, Rock'N'Roll Over, and Love Gun could put out something this terrible. Ace Frehley bailed on the band because he didn't want anything to do with this album.It's in my collection but I never listen to it."
1,"Music From the Elder, AWFUL Joke","Tell me this is a joke!!We are suppose to take these guys as serious musicians?Maybe the replacements for Ace,and Peter Criss were talented..But this stuff is if anything of any value, a good laugh at a really bad ""concept"" album.No wonder they went back to the Sex, Drugs and Rock n' Roll2 Thumbs down for the lyrics"
4,Enjoyable,"I used to hate this, but when I got a little older and gave it another listen it is outstanding. It's a musical adventure. There are tons of things to hear in music from the Elder. It's a long way from Kiss' normal stuff. However, when they did this people were crazy. It was the late 70s."
1,"Where's the sex,drugs and rock n' roll?","Gene Simmons took pot shots at Emerson ,Lake and Palmer for being too serious in terms of musicianship.Here,we have Kiss trying their turn at serious musicianship with less than stellar record sales.Not so easy is it guys?Kiss is an act ,that happens to play music.No serious musician listens to Kiss to steal licks or technique.They do however love to steal the business model that made these guys famous and rich.Kiss's stab at serious concept music is a bit like Stallone trying to do Shakespeare.Not a good fit.Their niche is party music that glorifies sex,drugs and rock n' roll.It may not play well with their egos ,but it does so with their bank accounts."
4,4.5 stars,Why is this album so disliked? I was 11 years old when I got this album. I loved it then and I still listen to it today.
1,Name of the Tango,The name of the fantastic Tango (which one doesn't find on this soundtrack) is: Por Una Cabeza from Carlos Gardel
4,Can someone help me?,"I am a great fan of the movie True Lies, and I was wondering if someone could help me locate the tango music that plays when Arnold is dancing at the party. Does anyone know where I can get that song from, or even what it's called? I would really appreciate it if anyone could help me."
2,not worth it,"Not worth the five dollars. The whole ""book"" is only a handful of pages that doesn't give any real insight into the matter it discusses. Plus, you can find it all online if you look."
5,Reckless Disregard,"This is a very eye opening book and is very well documented. It's unfortunate that the facts and precepts are true. It's much more unfortunate that the liberal media do not care to report the same facts or from a point of view that shares contempt for lying, exposes lying and opens the book on liberal leaders who consider American freedoms and power as offensive. Every voter needs to read books like this and specifically this book to have a basic idea as to why they have the freedom to vote in the first place. A great deal of visceral response is found in the reading of this book. All of it is worth experiencing. I strongly recommend it."
1,Reads as though it were written by an insolent child,"Book lacks any serious credability. Simple and poorly articulated right wing propaganda. Save your money, buy a comic book instead."
1,Typical conservative fare,"Just enough facts to allow the author to disguise their personal biases, but the heart of the content, the attacks on Kerry's war record, have been overwhelmingly shown to be nothing less than unsupported fiction. Don't waste your money on this book. If you want to read fiction, look for something from Asimov or Tolkien."
1,Another underemployed right-wing blowhard weighs in,"Think twice about listening to anything by someone who picks a nickname like ""Buzz.""So much of the garbage in this book has been discredited, I suggest saving your money and checking it out of the library - and then researching his claims.This is the ex-military hack who has little else to peddle but second and third-hand smears. He disgraced his uniform by passing on unfounded gossip about his former commander, Bill Clinton. Kinda scary when you think about the whack jobs walking around with access to the very special briefcase.He continues his diatribe here against Kerry and any other Democratic politician he can put in his sights. His claims are laughable, and easily disproven by a simple Internet search of the mainstream news reports.As mostly right wing diehards will be the ones bothering to read the book, he will convince few who didn't already agree with him in principle anyway."
5,the price and the performance,don't let the price fool you. i got these BB's at dicks sporting goods for $10 bucks. the ones on amazon are $16 dollars including shipping and handling. then you have to wait weeks for them. althouth i didn't buy these BB's from amazon they work great.
5,It's exact what I need,"Admission Matters is the book I need when start studying about US Colleges Admission for my son. I was totally lost among hundreds of books on this subject available in Amazon, especially when it was my first time. Luckily I have found the right one! After reading this book I think that I don't have to spend much more time for this matter. The book covers every my concerns with details comprehensively. It also includes necessary guides to further resources so that readers can check and update old information. Though it was three years now since latest edition, principles and processes it discusses still be valid and applicable. We need to update details which may be certainly changed yearly. Strongly recommend to people who are completely not familiar to the matter like me."
1,Extremely disappointed,The embedded Japanese subtitle make this opera unenjoyable. I rely on English subtitles when viewing opera as they are usually in a language I cannot speak of understand. The English subtitle are available on this dvd but they are placed directly over the Japanese. This makes them wery difficult to read. I will have to search for another version of this opera in order to really enjoy it.
1,Waste of Time and Money,"I bought Quicken 2006 and TurboTax 2005 last year to help with my tax preparation (both versions for Mac). After wasting a year entering my finances into Quicken (it won't automatically sync with my bank, HSBC, and the import function is buggy and useless), I discovered that I cannot export information into TurboTax, which is made by the same horrible company, because TurboTax will only accept a file format that Quicken cannot produce.A total, frustrating waste of time and money. The registration process does not work. The software does not work. The functions that would make you buy the software do not work. Every step of the process is a disaster. Save yourself the hassle and the cash."
4,I loved the movie so much!!!!!!!!!!!,"I loved the movie sky high and the soundtrack is okay. I LOVE the bowling for soup remake of the old ""I melt with you."""
1,"Oh boy, this is awful",This is easily one of the worst soundtracks I have heard. Lots of faceless Radio Disney acts hack up major and minor 80's hits. Even the usually impeccable They Might Be Giants sound like they are calculating how many house payments their fee will cover. Search out the original versions of these songs to find out how they sound when played by musicians with talent.
3,not good enough,"I think that this subject, the birth of the Punisher, or the background for his birth, should be one of the best possible chances any writer will ever have to be creative and violent in his storytelling. Alas, this story is only violent. There is no creativeness. The Vietnam setting dosen't really get used in the story, the action far too much resembles that of Platoon, and the story is only about half as long as it should be.I must applaud the interaction between Frank Castle and Death though. I don't, as another reviewer does, see it as unlikely or out of character. It's a psychological twist to the character that would become the Punisher. It gives him that sort, in lack of better words, mental dysfunction, that one would expect from a man as brutal and determined as the Punisher.Overall, I don't think justice has been done to the subject of the birth of the Punisher, but there are a few good things in there."
3,Thinly Plotted But Pretty Good,"Punisher Born shows that Frank Castle was a hard bitten US Marine in the Viet Nam War, dispensing his own brutal justice long before he became The Punisher.Darrick Robertson's art is nicely done, albeit with a few major blunders. For example, his opening scene of a US C-130 is not well drawn and later on he shows a US airstrike that first depicts a pair of F-8 Crusaders that mysteriously transform one panel later into a pair of F-4 Phantoms. That is way too big of a blunder.The coloring is excellent, especially in the jungle scenes. It's a solid piece of the Punisher puzzle but I think Garth Ennis could have plotted it more thickly."
1,gilmore girls - 4th season,"The last dvd in the season had the correct label, but was from a much later season. So we were not given the complete 4th season set. We are missing the correct last dvd."
5,Great series,My wife is a huge fan of this show and we loved watching through them again. The DVD's were in perfect condition!
5,Love this show,This is such a great show and being able to watch it streaming on Amazon makes it even better. Four stars for me!
5,Gilmore Love,"My wife adores these, having seen them back in college. She had talked about these over the years, so I took a shot at rekindling those fond memories - and it worked ... in spades. I find myself really enjoying them, too. Most TV - now or back to the late 40s - has rarely been so well written. If you're going to only buy a few TV series, this should make the list."
4,A Beautiful Book,"This is a lovely book for young children. The illustrations are enchanting and have captivated the children with whom I have shared it. Although the text is a psalm, you need not be concerned that it is a ""religious"" book in that is not preachy. I have given it to children of several faiths."
2,&#45824;&#54620;&#48124;&#44397;,"The shape is really awkward. It's not a clean, straight rectangle like flags should be - there's an obtuse angle [about 170 degrees?] in the middle of the flag, so I have to overlap a portion of the flag to make it appear like a rectangle. Otherwise the material is of nice quality for only five dollars."
2,The Other Reviewers Must Be FAMILY MEMBERS....,"The book is not absolutely horrible.... its just so fundamentally basic as to be elementary. The principal message: add up all of your expenses along with how much you want to earn and simply make certain that you charge customers/clients more. Hummmm... food for thought. If you've ever taken a business class in high school (not to mention college, an MBA program, or have any business experience at all), this book is beneath you. Otherwise, the book has been well-written and well-illustrated. Grade: C-/D+"
2,It could have been different,"This book is mediocre. The layout is fine, quite attractive. But the contents are obvious. One can hardly believe that somebody needed to write a book about it. There is nearly no insight. Only common sense.The writer is skilled, she could have made a much better book on a wider subject. But where she stands with this book, it is simply poor. You should read instead her other book which is very good: ""Where Did the Money Go?""."
4,Fun Album,"Great little blues/rock album. Came outta nowhere and enjoyed ZERO publicity. Relegated to cut-out/throw away bin status...what a shame. This kid was an Ausie who really had IT. I understand he was extremely ill and not sure what ever became of him after this record. If you like Jonny Lange,Kenny Wayne Sheppard and the sort,you will certainly appreciate this record. Hes not exactly the shredder that those guys are but take it for what it is...this kid was like TWELVE years old when it came out. He was surrounded by a very solid group of players and the production value is excellent as well. The kid does a couple of tasty covers and the rest are well written by HIM. This is a great one to have! Throw it on and impress people with this hidden gem. Its a shame nothing more was heard from him."
4,"Philosophy and theology, not training","This is one of those books that may be misunderstood by some who buy it. Wicca 333 is a discussion of current philosophy, beliefs, and theology from a Wiccan perspective. MacMorgan addresses several current topics such as feminism and Wicca, science and Wicca, proselytizing, real history, and others. If you are a ""trad"" Wiccan who already knows ""the one true way,"" then forget it. If you're looking for a more advanced ""how to"" book of super duper magick, it's the wrong book. But if you're a thoughtful Wiccan theologian or philosopher who enjoys keeping up with what others are saying and thinking about Wiccan religion, ethics, history and philosophy then this is a must for your reference library."
5,Great album!,"I've been waiting for YEARS for this CD to be released, and I have to say that it does not disappoint! Every track is a work of art, an intricate blend of dynamic and moving music, soothing vocals, and a great message, to boot! I love this CD! The only thing that could make this CD more perfect would be a little more variety in styles/tempos or a little more ""danceability"", but by no means am I saying that this album is boring! It's great fun to listen to in any setting, whether on headphones, computer, or even in a noisy car. ;)I think this is an excellent album with a strong, positive message and I highly reccommend it!"
2,Interesting premise but clumsy and naive,"An interesting premise, with a man from the past impacting the future. But it was naively plotted with wooden characters and comic book style plot development, and was clumsily worded."
2,only one story in Kindle version,"This version only contains The Variable Man, I was disappointed to discover the stories mentioned in the other review are not here. This is a good story but I really bought this for Autofac which is not here. Don't be mislead like I was."
4,What I love about SF ....,"My first PKD story in years and wow it was terrific. A quick read with lots of bang, action, intrigue and surprise. I recommend it highly especially to sf purists who love classic tales unburdened by excessive language and unnecessary description. A quick adrenaline rush returning me back to the nostalgic moments when I first discovered science-fiction as a boy."
2,2 stars,"Fans of shows such as Hercules or Xena will likely find much to enjoy in this epic saga. With humor reminescent of the type that characterized such shows, it tells the story of a warrior whose life journey is watched over by gods and goddesses. Against dangers untold, he wrests with prophecy and monsters alike. Great originality is exhibited in the creation of new creatures that are both sentient enough to be bound under a gaes, yet struggle to mold it to their own will. As this is appears to be book two in a series according to the title, new readers may have a bit of at sea feeling, however.Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."
5,Reviwed For Pricing Purposes Only,"I'm reviewing this only to provide availabilty and pricing info to compare with these inflated used prices.As of 03/25/08, Amazon.uk (England) was offering as ""New"" this recording at 9 pounds (18 US dollars). It has a different cover, a copy of the original Lp issue cover, but it's the same performances. Net of the VAT, Amazon.uk charged me 7.5 pounds ($15 US)plus 3.5 pounds air shipping ($7 US). Total cost $22 plus my Visa card's currency conversion charge haven't gotten that yet)$22 total compares pretty favorably to these used prices. Delivery time was 7 days. You might want to consider cross checking out of print items with the English site. Your American login will work just fine.If you are wondering what the current currency equivalents might be for you, just type into your search engine (I suggest Google): ""dollars to pounds conversion"". All sorts of calculators will come up.Best wishes."
3,Not Very Waterproof,"I wore these boots a lot during the Winters and cold weather. Slogging through puddles, slush and snow, these boots did not keep my feet very dry. They are made out of many pieces of leather unlike more expensive models of boots that are made out of a single piece. The stitching between the different pieces of leather started coming undone causing water and slush to enter the boot. I'm not sure if they are Gore-Tex Lined..but since my feet got wet, I'm guessing they weren't. I wore literal holes in the soles after just 3 years of wearing them which seems a little premature. The positive of this boot- It fits very well to the foot and had a nice stiff sole. Would I buy them again? Definitely Not. They served me for 3 years, and now it's time for a much needed upgrade."
4,So Paris,"I like the bracelet and I think it's beautiful.Just two notes:The blue cristals are paler than I expected.The clasp is not heart shaped and it's very hard to open.Like a lot of other buyers, I already lost one cristal. So the bracelet don't look so special anymore."
4,A Strong Opening,"I've set about reading the John le Carré collection from start to finish, and as his first book this is a strong introduction to George Smiley and an interesting, fast moving tale. It's almost simple compared to some of the later intrigues, but in that there's interest by itself. You can take this book either as the opening to le Carré's work, or a good page turner of a mystery novel in its own right."
5,Excellent Read,John le Carre has always been one of my favourite authors and I have many hard and soft copies of his many books. However I have never read Call for the Dead until I tried the tindle version. It did not disappoint me in any way; his plot is so well constructed and it is impossible to put the book down when engrossed in the story. An excellent and must read!
5,"The best lotion I have ever used, and I have tried a lot!","From time to time, I stray to different lotions by other brands, just to try something new, but I ALWAYS end up coming back to the Camille Beckman products. They really are the best. I like the glycerine hand therapy better than the body lotion, which doesn't seem to work quite as well. Some of the scents are too flowery for me, but I really like the vanilla, mango beach, and lime leaves. The powder is nice too."
4,Nice...,I reall like the hand cream but did care for the scent. I will try a different scent next time. Left my hands very soft though.
5,Miracle cream,"I got this cream as a last resort. My hands and feet felt like sandpaper. This Camille Beckman hand therapy has worked wonders for me. I've only used it about 10 days, and my feet are as soft as a baby's butt. My hands feel like silk. I even have my husband using it. His hands are always cracked and sore, and he can feel a difference after using it twice. It truly is a fantastic product. You will be seeing alot of me. It also smells wonderful. I use it every day and every night."
1,no me ha llegado,"hola,todavia no me llego el articulo ,espero que me llegue a la brevedad ,saludos y gracias,hola,todavia no me llego el articulo ,espero que me llegue a la brevedad ,saludos y gracias,diego fabian soracco"
5,One of the best!,"This is one of the best kiss album's ever. Has 4 of the best kiss song's ever. Not only that the other song's are great!Detroit Rock City:9/10 One of the best. Plain and simple.King Of The Night Time World:8/10 Under-rated classic.God Of Thunder:9/10 Might be gene's best song Ever.Great Expectations:7/10 Ok,I like it the more I listen to it.Flaming Youth:8/10 I really like this song.Sweet Pain:5/10 Never really liked this one.Shout It Out Loud:10/10 Best song by kiss for all time.Beth:8/10 Real nice ballad.Do You Love Me?:8/10 I love the lyric's and Drums but, cool guitar part's are not to be found.Overall This album is ONE OF THE BEST!!!"
2,Superfluous To The Plot,"I fell for it and figured I'd get something out of the deal, but in reality, this remix is completely superfluous to the plot as it brings little or no value. Add in the lack of any real bonus tracks, compounded with an editing flaw in Flaming Youth and the fact Bob spoke so glowing about everyone working so hard on this album that he forgot to mention the part about replacing Ace with Dick Wagner (and rightfully so) and you have a waste of $9. If you think this cd provides value to your life, then by all means, buy away...else, stay away...UPDATE!!! Because of the obvious manufacturing flaw in Flaming Youth, I decided to return this product for a refund (and rightfully so). I guess I Won't Get Fooled Again Who style.And one final note: Ezrin mentions in the liner notes to consider this a face lift. Well, sometimes these things go wrong and the original product would have been better if it stayed au naturale...just ask Kenny Rogers, Priscilla Presley and Bruce Jenner."
2,Q. You know what would be even more pointless than this?,"A. A reissue of the first album on cd and 180 gram virgin vinyl without ""Kissin' Time.""Admit it.You'd buy it.I would.A vinyl copy at least."
5,IT DOES NOT GET BETTER THAN THIS KISS!,"This is to any KISS fan around the world, the best album ever! With rock n roll anthems like Detroit Rock City, and more evil songs like God of Thunder, and the slower songs like Great Expectations and Beth. I'd have to say that Shout it Out Loud and Beth are definitely my favorite on the album. Even though I am only 12, I have extremely good taste in classic rock. If you havn't actually listened to KISS, then this album is the one for you. These gods of rock i think probably fit in with guys like Black Sabbath, or maybe Led Zepplin. All in all, get this mother f**king album for my sake. P.S., if any of the guys from KISS read this review, im tellin you, you gotta have another tour! If you do, make sure you come to Seattle this time! YEAH! Let's rock n roll all night, and party every day!"
4,Does it sound better? YES...but with minor flaws....,"First of all...this is the best remix/remastering of a classic KISS album so far.It sounds phenomenal!!!But of course there are a at least a couple of flaws.....One being the skip on the intro to ""Flaming Youth""...which has been addressed in other reviews.If you don't notice it, you're not a true fan.....My biggest gripe is the ""added"" or repeated background vocals on ""Detroit Rock City""...I feel they ruin the song.Too bad, because besides that, this is a great release.....should have left the song alone."
5,Best KISS studio album,"Production wizard Bob Ezrin really helped the band create a studio masterpiece with this album. Not as powerful as ""Alive"", but still a trippy, diverse and heavy KISS album with rockers, ballads and sonic effects that make it almost like a concept album (check the intro tale of the ill-fated concert goer). The album has classic tunes and a great ""sound"". Best cuts: God of Thunder (heavy, scary Gene Simmons mammoth) and Detroit Rock City (an anthem)."
1,"Sound skip on intro of ""Flaming Youth""","This disc had sound skip on intro of ""Flaming Youth"" and I have returned it. I think it is a problem of manufacturing process. Are there any other claims on it?"
4,Pure Rock,This ranked #496 on there list this was another good rock album this is pure hardrock and I am sure there are many young kiss fans I was never really a fan.I need something to review so why not review this album.Plus it has Shout it out on hereLyrics 7/10 Productin 7/10 Music 10/10 Style 9/10 Voice 6/10Overall=39/50 wich is enought for a 4 star release from Kiss.
2,Metal fatique,"Apparantly, this saw arrived with weakness in the metal as a few teeth dropped off on the very first use - after only a few seconds of cutting. This is no reflection on the vendor but may not bode well for the manufacturer. I returned the saw for a refund."
2,"difficult to stay with, not to Scarpetta standards","Reading Cornwell books is a little slice of heaven. Unfortunately, Hornet's Nest did make the cut. Instead of being an intense 3 day read, the book still sits on the self, half completed. Cornwell fans will find this one a sleeper."
1,Terrible boring pointless work.,"Even if Cornwell had never written another book, this would still be terrible. If this was her first, her career as a writer would hopefully have ended.I forced myself to finish the book, assuming the plot was on the next page, but it never came.her next book should be submitted to an editor, she should get out of this new genre."
1,What's with the cat?,"Since Patsy and I both went to Davidson College, I thought that after a long period of bashing her, I would actually *read* one of her novels to discover for myself the source of the world's fascination with her work.Unfortunately, I picked up this one.Harlequin Romance novels are better than this. Legal briefs are better than this. Self-induced pain is better than this.You get the point. I'm embarrassed that the world knows about Davidson from this book and associates Davidson with Patricia Cornwell. The irony? She endows a scholarship for up-and-coming freshmen that show special promise in writing. At least there's some justice, because there's no mystery here: it's _all_ bad."
1,Fairly good read until the last 20 pages,"This was my first Patricia Cornwell book and what a disappointment it was. It had some attention grabbing moments but the ending was atrocious. I normally don't mind when an author lets you draw your own conclusions about certain items but this left so many unanswered questions it reminded me of when I had to write a 500 word essay in school -- once you reach the 498th word you stop & close with ""The End."""
2,Very disappointed.,This was not at all what I expected when I picked up this book. I just assumed that it would be the continuing life of Dr. Kay Scarpetta. I was very disappointed and hope that future books written by Patricia Cornwell will be returning to Dr. Scarpetta and all of the other characters which I have grown to enjoy with each book. I look forward to any new books written by Ms. Cornwell which include the family and friends of Dr. Scarpetta.
1,An inexcusable consumer rip-off!,"What a huge disappointment for me and my husband; we enjoyed Cornwell's other books and feel that both she and her publisher took leave of their senses in bringing forth ""Hornets' Nest"" to an unsuspecting public. What a stinker- it should have had a warning from the Surgeon General: Reading this may destroy brain cells!"
1,THE Patricia Cornwell?,"What more can I add to what others have said? This book has to be one of the worst I have read in a long time. The plot is laughable (particularly the bit about the cat!), the dialog is false and the characters are totally unsympathetic. I love the Kay Scarpetta books, and have real trouble believing this one is by the same author. Are there two Patricia Cornwells? If you want a tip - don't waste either your money or your time on this one (unless you're having trouble getting to sleep at night, that is...)"
1,Welcome to the world of novelized soap operas.,"While there is nothing wrong with a well established mystery novelist writing two or more different serials concerning completely different sets of well established characters, Cornwell is obviously demonstrating at her fans expense the fact that she can't handle it. With this novel we have her rather sickly version of a soap opera in print. It plainly doen't work. First of all, a mystery novel is the wrong place for a soap opera. Secondly, Cornwell doesn't even clean up the soap opera's act well enough to make it worth the effort. And thirdly, who does Cornwell think she is insulting our intelligence with this nonsense?"
2,Cornwell missed the mark on this one!,I was disappointed in the story and found it slow and almost slogging at some points. I did not feel that the characters were well developed or that the dialogue was real. She usually does such a good job of letting us into the minds of her characters and I feel this was lacking in this particular book. Not her best effort.
5,"Complex, and good","I felt that this book had the greatest combination of action and personal issues. Unlike Unatural Exposure, the book dealt with personal issues and how it affected the characters involvement with the case. I really like this book and look forward to reading Southern Cross."
2,Not Enough Suspense & Lacking Scarpetta,"I have read several of Cornwall's Scarpetta books which I have enjoyed very much. Hornet's Nest lacks the suspense and focus of the others. It seems to drag on in too much detail without moving toward a conclusion very well. It was ok, but well below the quality or good read characteristics of the others."
2,Quite a let down,"For fans of Kay Scarpetta this is not your kind of book. The book wanders around between uninteresting characters in a uninteresting storyline. She remembers in the last few pages that her genre is murder mystery and actually solves a crime. For most of the book we are taken deep within individual character's personal drama, a shallow, boilerplate look at best. As a fan of Cornwell it was a huge letdown"
1,Absolutely Abominable,"I bought the audio version of the book because I have a long commute to and from work and listening to books on tape ""usually"" make my rides more enjoyable. NOT THIS TIME! At first I thought maybe it was the reader (Chris Sarandon) and I apologize for all the terrible things I thought and said about his reading. Now I realize it was just the absolutely abominable text he had to work with. Since we now know that Ms. Cornwell is gay, I think the fact that she was trying to write about male/female relationships was the major problem. In the Kay Scarpetta books, it's the murder to solve, not the relationships that take center stage. In this book, it's husband and wife, male and female relatinships that she concentrates on and obviously she doesn't have a clue. Instead of providing me with relief from stress when driving this book raised my blood pressure to dangerous levels. A warning from the surgeon general should be attached to each copy"
2,unsuccessful experiment,"I am one of the many fans who purchased the hardcoveredition of this novel on first sight, and wish I'd savedmy money. While engaging enough for me to finish it, Iwas left disappointed. In reading this genre, I preferthat the underlying mystery be the central focus of eachstory, with some compelling characters providing theconnecting thread between novels.Here, PC seems to be performing an experimentin establishing new characters: take a set of stereotyped,sexist, characters from a 30-year-old novel, reverse theirgenders, and let them bounce off each other for a while.The characters didn't work for me, and with theunderlying mystery given a low priority, neither did thisnovel."
3,"Women Rule, Men are Swine","Have you noticed that most of the men in Cornwell's books are weenies? Same characters as ""Southern Cross."" Not as interesting as the books featuring Scarpetta and Marino."
2,No more cats!,"I have read all of Cornwell's books so far, with the exception of Black Notice. This is the only one I didn't mind putting down. Really could have done without the cat! I am an animal lover and think that many animals are rather intelligent, but COME ON!"
1,Absolutely the worst writing Patricia Cornwell has released.,"Nothing else need be written. If her new book, Southern Cross, (same setting and same characters) is anything like the Nest, we'd better take up a collection for Pat. She's going to need the money."
1,"Don't buy the audio-cassette version, either!","From skimming the many reader comments, I see I am not alone in thinking that this P. Cornwell does not meet her usual standards. Bad, choppy writing, poor character development, wandering plot, all EXACERBATED by the dreadful narration of Chris Sarandon. His shrill and strident speech is grating, the bad southern accents are horrible, while the background music is discordant and poorly timed. I was really glad to be done with this recorded book. For an idea of how it should be done, rent or buy any George Guidall narration for RECORDED BOOKS, INC"
1,Terrible disappointment,Please return to your usual wonderful style of writing. I will never buy another book with these characters.
2,It's not nearly as good as her other books,"I've been an avid reader of Patricia Cornwell's since the beginning...Although I found Hornet's Nest interesting in parts, it was in no way the caliber of her other books..I frankly miss Kay, her neice, Kay's relationship with her FBI bow, and Kay's constant attempt to educate the Captain..I realize that authors must try virgin territory but I certainly hope that Patricia returns to the characters she has developed and allow her readers to continue in their life."
2,A Let Down !,"A long time fan of Cornwall's - I jumped at the chance of reading her latest. What a let down. I cannot believe this is the same author. While a change of direction could present the readers a pause, this effort was not satisfying. I continue to be a fan - she has provided hours of pleasure. So I think I will reserve judgement and condemnation for her next novel. Perhaps that will tell us all if we have lost the reason so many of us have burned the midnight oil. Patricia - please make it worth the wait and shut the critics up"
2,Not up to par with Cornwell's earlier stories.,"I have been reading Patricia Cornwell's books ever since her first one was published. In the beginning the stories were fast-paced, exciting and you couldn't wait to get to the end. Hornet's Nest is the worst of all; minimal plot, characters come in and out every few pages, having little to do with moving the story along. It almost seems they are fillers, just taking up space. I'm disappointed in Hornet's Nest and disappointed in Patricia Cornwell. I won't buy any more of her novels"
5,Hornet's Nest,Love Patricia Cornwell books. This one was as good as any. Suspenseful and entertaining.
4,I finally understand the raves about Patricia Cornwell!,"It's not a Kay Scarpetta thriller--Thank Goodness! Instead of labyrinthine and unlikely plot twists, irritating and unlikeable characters, and completely flat character development, Patricia Cornwell has written an engrossing, human, and funny book!Don't expect a classic mystery. It's more of a slice of life of police enforcement in Charlotte, North Carolina. All of the characters, good and bad, come from families (good and bad), have connections, make mistakes, and do the best they can, even if the best they can is hanging out with homeboys and robbing Hardee's.Unfortunately for this book, if the Kay Scarpetta series has turned you off already, you are unlikely to bother with another Patricia Cornwell book. And if you've come to expect the over-written plot, flat pacing, and judgemental and irritating characters of the Kay Scarpetta works, you may find yourself in new territory with this one."
1,More than a disappointment,"I have been a loyal reader of Patricia Cornwell's books and I have never been more disappointed in a favored author. Patricia's tight writing style and well-rounded characters are simply nowhere to be found in Hornet's Nest. I am hoping this was a momentary abandonment by her muse and not the disintegration of a previously excellent writer. For those of you who read Hornet's Nest but have not read PC's previous novels, I implore you to read her other books. You will find wonderful characters that you grow to care about, or at the very least, wish to come across again. Unfortunately, the most interesting character in Hornet's Nest was Niles, the cat, although he apparently over-indulged in the catnip near the end of the book. Sorry Patricia."
2,Was this a draft??,"I agree with the general drift here of Cornwell's Hornet's Nest. It pales next to her well-developed Kay Scarpetta novels. The novel has a rough-edged, unfinished quality to it -- not to mention that the plot is all over the place -- and I wonder if her publisher insisted on getting this book to print way before Cornwell was ready. I respect her effort to try something new, but in the future I hope she sticks to her guns and doesn't publish before she is ready. She can do much much better than this, as Cornwell fans are well aware."
1,What happened to her writing??,"I got lost after the first 20 pages, too many characters that meant nothing. Her other books were so much better that this. What a disappointment!! Hope her future books are not like this one. Please!"
4,Good but a little tedious,"My first Patricia Cornwell book, and I more or less read it in one sitting, standing (NYC subway, platforms, etc.). Gripping most of the time, but drags a little bit..."
1,Possibly one of the worst books I have ever read,"I walked into my bookstore and saw this on the shelf and bought it instantly, knowing I loved P. Cornwell's writings. I then cleared my calender for the next day so I could curl up and read my favorite author. Well, needless to say I couldn't stand to torture myself by making myself read this book in one day. I did stick it out though thinking, surely it had to get better this is, after all this is the author of the fabulous Scarpetta novels. This has got to be one of the most pointless books ever written. I felt like Steve Martin yelling at John Candy in Planes, trains and automobiles, ""When you tell a story HAVE A POINT"
1,"The Cat that ate the ""Hornet's Nest""","I have been reading Cornwell since her first bookwas published and loved everyone of them. That wasuntil I read Hornet's Nest. What a waste of paper,the only character I could identify with was the cat. The ""Female"" characters in the book were tointo themselves and the only really male character""Brazil"" was a moron...Could Cornwell be putting her own troubles with sexuality into her writing?Didn't we get enough of that by her turning Lucyinto a lesbian? I ran out to get ""Hornet's Nest""the day it came out and paid full price for it.I learned a great lesson, I am waiting for her next novel to hit the used bookstore before I purchase it this time. It's really too bad, She was one of the few female author's I really enjoyed and looked forward to reading. My suggestion to those who are looking for a great book, SKIP THIS ONE, AND DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
1,Hornet's Nest stings the reader,"If Patricia Cornwell wrote ""Hornets Nest"" then who is the real author of the Kay Scarpetta series. Shame on the author and the publisher for using this cheap con practice on a loyal reading public for profit purposes. The writer of this book must have followed a recipe package, using dollops of sex, violence, romance, personality disorders, and other seamy spices --- the trouble is that the finished product remains unfinished and gives the reader a bad case of nauseous indigestion. It will be a while before I suspiciously pick up any other 'Cornwell' book"
2,Hornet's Nest,"I love Patricia Cornwell's books, but was disappointed with ""Hornet's Nest."" Dr Scarpetta was not in it which was a dissappointment in itself. It had a good plot, but seemed rushed and thrown together. She has the talent to do much better."
4,The best cd rom,I love barbie hit mix it is so cool! But i dont agree with that they call it barbie hit mix because barbie is not in it its just a group of girls singing!From: Kristal :)
2,Double Platinum 'Hatchet Job',"With the release of digital remasters, Paul called this one a 'hatchet job'.... and rightly so. The songs are great, except for the Strutter '78 because of the disco type drumming (c'mon, this is supposed to be a hard rock classic)... but the sound is trash, esp. noticible on Deuce, 100,000 Years, and Love Gun.... for being digitally remastered, it's really muffled, badly.... Unless you're a hardcore KISS fan (is there any other type of KISS fan?), save your money and give this one a WIDE berth."
3,"Good, but nothing compared to ""alive"" and ""Destroyer""","I finally found a band capable of writing so many foolish lyrics like AC/DC: this is Kiss on this CD. But the rock is there, good as ever. At the lyric department, at least, they improved so much, like in ""Music from the Elder"" and, say what you wante, in ""Psycho Circus""."
4,The high water mark,"Contrary to the amazon review, this was not the last album with the original Kiss line-up, but I'll move on.This album represents, to me, the high water mark for Kiss in the seventies. The songs are all classics, and even the remake of ""She Kissed Me"" isn't too unbearable. Also, this is the first album that all four members sang lead vocals.That said, don't be too hard on poor old Ace. No, he doesn't have a great voice. Neither does Gene, but that doesn't stop him.Overall, this is a must have for diehard Kiss fans, and the newest recruits in the Kiss Army. For the uninitiated, this is a great example of seventies Rock and Roll at it's finest."
3,Be more Accurate !,"This is not the last album with the original line up , as Amazon stated.Dynasty was !Get your facts straight please."
2,Stink-o-rama!,"I remember when this came out. I was learning to play drums and Rock and Roll Over was the last studio album KISS came out with. That album rocked!I could jam on it! Love Gun was filled with so much mediocre non-rocking filler, I could not play through it. Listening to Love Gun today it still feels like a product delivery deadline and a cash in from the band. They were not hungry and probably burned out. Only for Kiss Kollectors."
2,Out Damned G-Spot!,"Tristan Taormino isn't a very good writer but this book has some useful information. For men, the chapter on women's G-spot and ejaculation is the best part of the book. The chemistry of female ejaculate was a surprise to me. But I still read that the G-spot is refuted by some biologists. Many women search for it in vain. Come out, come out whereever you are! Wish fulfillment maybe? : )"
5,Great product at a great price!,Don't need to say too much. Great desktop or tree limb tri-pod. Design is sturdy and easily adjustable. Only way it could be better is it it were made from aluminum instead of plastic.
4,"Ok, but there are better choices for a tabletop tripod...","If you need something that will attach to limbs, handlebars, etc., then this little tripod works well. If your basic need is a table top tripod, there are better choices. I own 2, including thisVista TBLTOPPRO Table Top Pro Tripod, and for table top use, the Vista is better. However, the Vista cannot handle the 'strap it to something else' that the Pedco can. Both are lightweight and compact.So, it really depends on what you will use it for. I have both, so I can use the Vista on the patio table, or the Pedco strapped to a tree. I believe the Pedco would be better for smaller cameras, as it may have an issue holding a Canon dSLR with the kit lens on something like handlebars."
3,Fish Breath,"The pills are easy to swallow and have no taste. I've been taking them for a couple of days now and there is a nearly constant fishy smell in my mouth. I like that these are natural, but I will be trying another DHA supplement when this bottle runs out."
2,One Song Played Over and Over and Over,"KISS wasted absolutely no creativity on ROCK AND ROLL OVER -- going for simple-minded stomp-rock as if the vitality poured into the earlier DESTROYER album left the band too exhausted to do anything but the minimum. There are no anthems a la FLAMING YOUTH or SHOUT IT LOUD. No wacky conceptual numbers like GOD OF THUNDER. OVER is pretty much one song played over and over again about lust and ... lust. The group got its act together for one last gasp on the follow-up, LOVE GUN. That album at least boasts the strange ALMOST HUMAN and the slightly crazy cover of THEN HE KISSED ME. OVER gets two stars only because its one basic idea is pretty catchy and more fun than, say, Eddie Money."
5,awecellent,the hottest band in the world i can't say this is their greatest album because all their albums are great but you will love this one
3,Good But Not Great and Doesn't Live Up To Fans Hype,"I like Rock And Roll Over but I like Love Gun better and this album is probably my least favorite of the 70s albums. It's got some awesome songs like I Want You, Take Me, Hard Luck Woman and Makin' Love but I have always had a tough time warming up to some of the lesser known album cuts like Baby Driver, See You In Your Dreams(Gene's second version off his 1978 solo lp is a much better and improved version and the way I believed he heard it when he originally wrote the song and brought it to the band), Love Em Leave Em and even Calling Dr Love and Ladies Room I find less than exhilarating. I listen to this album the least. It does have some cool production and instrumentation. I like the use of 12 string and six string acoustic guitars on songs like Hard Luck Woman, Makin' Love and I Want You but the album just doesn't do much for me."
5,"I know...I just know-oo-woh, it's HOT!!","One of the best KISS albums! Listenable all the way through! Hey, their albums from '74-'78 were their best! Avoid anything from their '80's period."
3,Not bad but not as good as hyped,"Since this is the first album that I have listened to by Kiss (and I have all of them) it has a special place in my heart. Songs like ""I Want You"" and ""See you in Your Dreams"" are good cranking songs. The problem with this album is that it seems rushed. Albums like Destroyer have better songs and better lyrics than this album. A good album but not close to their best."
5,"Great seller, terrific product","This is a great product, and the merchant shipped in a timely manner. I live in the country here in North Carolina. My yard is bigger than most, so I require gardening products that are tough. This rake is sturdy and has a fiberglass handle. The merchant carefully boxed this product, and they shipped the item in an expedient manner. I would purchase from this merchant again. Product and merchant get an ""A"" on this transaction. Well done."
4,Jump Alyss...,"THe Looking Glass Wars is the first novel in the Looking Glass Wars series, Duh! But it was a great take on the great stories written by Lewis Carroll, where everything thing he wrote is actually a twisted up/changed up story of a little girls real life, Alyss."
4,Highly recommended by my daughter,"My 10-year-old daughter read this book and liked it. She says, ""I like the way it took an old story and made it into something new and exciting. I could not put it down."" If you are seeking books for a precocious reader, this one is recommended. My daughter devoured it within a day. Mom will have to add it to her reading pile, now."
4,"Too intense for a kid's book, but a really good read","I really liked this novel. It has many components that make the Harry Potter series so entertaining: love, wars, magic. I liked what Beddor did with the character of Alyss and I enjoyed many of his perspectives on characters that we thought we knew. Beddor obviously knows his Carroll.A few problems, though. It is wrong to market this as a childrens' book, as the topics discussed in this book might be at a higher level than most children can understand. Obviously teens would get more out of this novel, but older teens - this is not a book for the Harry Potter crowd. Also, the reader can tell that this is going to be a sequel book long before the end, and that is somewhat disconcerning if you want to make it to the end of the book. There are many loose ends left undone and it reminds me of the end of the Glass Books of the Dream Eaters. It must be the year for books to start series.A fun read and very entertaining."
2,Disappointing,"At first glance this is an interesting play on the theme of Alice in Wonderland. Under closer inspection the plot is underdeveloped and the writing lacks continuity. The tone uses modern day phrases that seem strange in the world of Lewis Carrol's beloved heroine. In fact, the writing as a whole seems too casual for the dark story the author is trying to present. The ending is blatantly left open for a sequel and without a sequel it seems mildly unfinished. The main characters lack depth, and the author seems unsure whether to make the villain Alyss'( alternative spelling for a new twist) Aunt Redd a truly frightening person or merely a comical overbearing caricature. Because of this indecision it is hard to feel any emotion about the villain. The end is an anticlimax and overall the book seems to juvenile to deal with the real underlying themes that made Alice in Wonderland a beloved tale. Don't read this book unless you have little experience with good writing."
3,Imaginative but not my Alice,"I am a fan of Charles Dodgson and of Alice in Wonderland. I read the books every year and have a small collection of Alice in Wonderland items.The book is imaginative. Wondertropolis, Hatter Madigan and General Dopplehangar who splits into multiples are all interesting adaptations.I guess what is missing and what it can't possibly have is Charles Dodgson's witty silliness. Hatter Madigan is who is most noticably altered. He is a solemn loner who's duty it is to protect the royal Heart family.I was dissapointed in the portrayal of Charles Dodgson as a stuttering, nervous idiot.All in all, it's not a bad story. It's not the best written piece of fiction but it does have its entertaining and exciting parts. If you are a fan of Alice in Wonderland and you forgive him for the things that I mentioned it is an interesting take on the story.I tried reading the second one ""Seeing Red"" but couldn't get into it. Perhaps later on."
4,Breaking them in is the key!!!,"These shoes are worth the money. Even thought I paid a little bit more at the New Balance store. The longer you wear them the better they feel. At first they hurt around the back of my ankle, but once they were broken in that was it. Good investment for your feet, even if your just standing around."
4,"brilliant, but not 5 stars. Possibly 4 and a half??. Ok 83%, that is precision","Only reason I am writing this is to disagree with a previous reviewer, penalty(Ca. I guess that is california), on one point. Huge agreement, this is an overlooked classic. Huge agreement, this album could do with a small amount of trimming. However, I believe the trimming should be aimed at one of the slow-mid tempo tracks, one too many I think. 'Something's gotta give' is the hidden pearl in an album of gems, and as for trimming the guitar outro.???????? Nooooooooooo! that guitar outro. turns a great song into a truly special one. That is it. I feel better for getting that off my chest.Anyway, if you do not know this band and you are a fan of big star, teenage fanclub, the byrds etc. buy this album now, you will love it."
1,Green Goblets,I am really disappointed in this glassware. The goblets are very small and not durable. Washed in dishwasher and the stem has already broke off of one of them. I do not recommend these for the price.
4,Rambone,It is a great product. It is thicker than what it looks like in the picture. It is a great stretch and the suction cup base is very strong. I cant wait until I can manage all of it. It is not a toy for the faint of heart. It shipped quickly and in a timely fashion.
5,Best camera there is,"Indeed, the absolute best possible compromise between weight, size, image quality and friendliness of use (and that includes the way the manual is written down). A camera designed to please in all aspects.Recommended 110%."
2,maybe there are better cameras,"This camera takes very good photos in the day, but awful photos at night. What I didn't like about this camera, is that you will need a tripod to take pictures if you are taking photos without flash or in an ambient with poor light, because your are going to get awful pictures.When you take pictures and you watch them on the display, you think they look beautiful, but when you download to the computer, you will see that some are shaken.Look for another camera. I am very sure that there are better than this one."
1,Tedious,"I picked up this book with a keen interest in the subject matter. The author is a Pulitzer Prize winner, but I found his writing style to be tedious. He has a fertile imagination for analogies and metaphor, but he writes as if he's explaining his concepts to children or adolescents, at best. Fifty pages about the difference between macro and micro is too much. I get it! I would have liked to finish the book to learn about the core concepts the author expounds, but this book was just too boring! I quit after the first third of the book, and I feel like reading that much was a waste of time."
2,Man and Meaning,"This book struggles with the central question, ""Who am I?"" and, ""Who are you?"" so it gets stars for the human who wrote the book and is willing to peer over the edge and allow us participate in his search. However, the author has sadly missed the opportunity to move from the ""I am"" to the great ""I AM"" thus solving his true identity. May he one day find the peace that he seeks and the true knowing that needs no explanation.Elizabeth Detoure"
2,I gave up after 83 pages,"This was not what I expected. I normally read either to educate myself or to amuse myself. I think this failed in both areas. I could follow (but not necessarily agree with) his logic about value systems, but had difficulty as to how that all relates to consciousness. Other problamatic areas where when the author dismisses interiority or innerness of (among other things) an automobile or a battleship. I think a great many car owners and sailors would question that. I also am not as confident that a misquito feels no hunger pains as the author, and there are major world religions where some people drink only filterwd water in order to not hurt smaller creatures. Maybe this whole book was just over my (layman) head.I finally decided to stop chasing my tail and end the feedback.The book binding though attractive, was sloppy and most pages were stuck together."
1,Absolutely hieroglyphics !,"Its absolutely hieroglyphics to me ! I read parts of GEB, but this book lacks both the clarity and the charm that was the virtue in GEB. I fail to see whats the book is aiming for. If you want to buy it, please read it from a library before you decide whether to buy it in first place."
4,What a classic,Awesome movie!! Was so happy they had this to watch on amazon video!! The video quality was actually pretty good too
5,Excellent inexpensive bookends,"I was looking for bookends to use in my kitchen that were simple, yet nice, to hold my cookbooks on our stainless steel shelf. These were perfect and did the trick!"
4,"Great, low profile book ends","These book ends work great, very low profile. I am happy with the purchase. Keeps all my cookbooks up and together."
4,Dont judge by title,Not a Bad future story of if humans lived on mars. This story mostly follows a merchant trader that got either vary lucky or unlucky depending on how you want to see it.
1,aaaaah horrible!,"Nobody, and I repeat NOBODY can cover Relient K. (with the exception of the String Quartet Tribute, that one is 5 stars) but plz for the sake of Relient K's name do not get this, it is a disgrace to the band and to bluegrass."
4,Awesome live album but last five songs are OK.,"The first 15 songs are classics, but the last five are not the best. I do know why they put studio songs on a live album. Anyway, ""Detroit Rock City"", ""King of the Night Time World"", ""Beth"", ""Love Gun"", ""I Stole Your Love"", ""Hard Luck Woman"", and ""Ladies Room"" are the BEST live songs there ever was, the there ever is, and the best there ever will be!"
4,Alive II Lives Up to Its Name,"Alive II, the second of KISS' three live albums, lives up to its name in that while the music on it is very good, it is the second-best of the three, getting beat out by the original, Alive!The songs on Alive II are representative of the music KISS recorded during the latter part of the 1970s after they had achieved fame as a flesh-and-blood live band with bombastic shows and hard-biting, blow-your-hair-back songs such as ""Detroit Rock City,"" ""Love Gun,"" ""God of Thunder,"" ""I Stole Your Love,"" ""Makin' Love,"" ""I Want You"" and ""Shout It Out Loud."" Alive II also includes the band's only big-hit ballad, ""Beth.""Despite five studio tracks at the end of the CD's second disc (which don't do KISS any justice), the album is a must-have for major KISS fans ... especially those who remember the original band's heyday or anyone who is curious to know what they were capable of in terms of a live recording."
3,The Live rendition rocks & the studio side Sucked,"I would like to say that Alive II is a great album. The song that I liked the most was God of Thunder. The start of the song you hear the deep roar of Gene's bass guitar, and right away you feel that your driven into his own little macabre world of horror. I think on a whole the live tracks ruled. But what I thought was the worst was the studio tracks. The Onlystudio track I liked was Rocket Ride. I felt that song captures the spirit of Ace's character. But if you want some good ear splitting music listen to Alive II. It may not be as good as Alive! but I gaurantee that it will be a somewhat good experience."
5,"If you want the best then get the best,Kiss alive II !!!","Kiss Alive II was a x-mas gift from my parents in 1978 and I rocked my house day and night. How can you beat a live album that starts out with ""you wanted the best,you got the best the hottest band in the world, KISS"" then it jumps right into ""Detroit Rock City"" only to be followed up with a wailing guitar and one of my favorites of the album ""King of The Nightime World"" If you want to purchase I feel is the best live album ever recorded this is the one. I also loved the studio tracks ! If ""All American Man"" doesn't get you feeling like your the baddest man in the world you've got a problem. I still listen to this album it is a timeless classic 5 stars ? hell yes !"
3,Alive II,"Kiss Alive II is a weaker live album than the original Alive. When Kiss released Alive, their concerts had been more popular than their albums. After Alive, they released Destroyer, Rock and Roll Over, and Love Gun, all of which were crafted in the studio. So the songs from these three albums don't work as well in a live setting as the songs from the first three albums did. Aive II is a decent recording with the exception of the 4th side of the tape or lp. The new studio tracks suck, they could've used more live material to fill up the last side."
2,Alive2: Not too good,"The second live album is in my opinion the worst of them. If you are lookng to add this cd to your collection, borrow it from a friend first- listen to it and maybe it will grow on you. I am a devout KISS fan and though i have it, it is one of the least KISS cd's I play."
3,good for five songs,"This release has nothing to offer other than the opening duo of Detroit/King,the better version of Shock Me and the two new studio tracks Larger Than Life and Rocket Ride.Not worth more than 10 bucks.I want to know why after going through the trouble to remaster and repackage both Alive albums in slimline jewel cases they still separated them into two discs each.Alive and Alive 2 could fit easily onto one disc each.They both run under 80 minutes.If there is a good reason for this will someone please tell me."
2,Somewhat Disappointing . . .,"I've been a fan of the BET Celebration of Gospel production's from their inception. But the for sale version of this one left me feeling cheated. They cut some very desirable performances by Yolanda Adams (featuring the ever-smooth Doc Powell) and Israel Houghton (featuring T-Bone, who burned it up that night) from the original taping. They also cut Steve Harvey's hosting spots. What's up BET? A disclaimer would have been appreciated."
4,Some Of Ace's Best Guitar Solos Make This A Must....,"Ace's solos on ""2000 Man"" & ""Hard Times"" make this a must have for any Kiss fan. Yes the lead song ""I Was Made For Lovin' You"" has a disco beat, but it's a great song; and again, Ace lets it rip on a great solo. Peter Criss is pictured on the cover, but does not play on the album. Anton Fig (of David Letterman's band) handles the drum work. Because of Peter's absence, ""technically"" you can't consider this a ""Kiss"" record. But setting that point aside, ""Dynasty"" is the last great record Kiss ever made. It's the great song writing and Ace's signature guitar that defines Kiss for me; and this is the last Kiss album where Ace really shines."
3,Floundering Dynasty,"After licking their wounds from the solo disasters, KISS came back with ""Dynasty."" But this wasn't really a comeback as much as it was an unstable atom trying hard not to fracture. It kicks off with three rapid fire shots then falls apart quick.""I Was Made For Loving You"" was pop disco as only KISS could have imagined it, and compared to most dance tracks fron that era, holds up rather well. Ace's reading of the Stone's ""2000 Man"" was proably his best moment on record as a singer. Finally, ""Sure Know Something"" was a great single that somehow got lost in the backlash that had formed around KISS.Unfortunately the rest of the album gasses out from here. History tells us that internal strife and excess was beginning to tear the band apart by now; listening to ""Dynasty"" with that backstory behind it hints at why the remainder of the record sounds so uninspired. (Great cover though. I had that poster on the wall though college!)"
2,Unfortunately this sold well,"Either this or Carnival of Souls is the least listenable of KISS's huge vault. This one like COS had Kiss getting away from their sound and dabbling into what everyone else was doing at the time which was Disco here and grunge with COS. Ace's song's except Save Your Love (his worst Kiss song) are good and Paul's I was made for Loving you and Magic Touch are good songs but recorded in disco fashion. I was Made rocked on Alive 3, I'd love to see them do that to Magic Touch also. Gene is missing in action with only two songs. They went soft again with the following Unmasked, but that one is still better than this one. Peter's song aint bad - atleast it wasn't Beth2 or HardER Luck Woman."
3,dynasty is pleasurable,"I think most people are afraid of any groups changing their sound.Groups want to change direction,fans don't.Although KISS is still classified as Heavy Metal{at least thats the filing in stores}can get away with a disco album.Imagine PANTERA going country? Or at least for one album? Scary thought isn't it.Never the less KISS will always be rejuvenating new fans and keeping their old.They actually had a symphony backing them up and it was excellent.I know I'm getting off the beaten path but for 79 this was a commercial hit in clubs and dancable.I still chuckle when I hear BETH.The song has no drumming.Its sung by Criss! Never a dull moment!"
4,1979,"Disco was huge at the time and KISS would explore the genre with ""I was made..."" and ""Sure know something"". These are both cool songs. Ace Frehley's version of the Stones' ""2000 man"" is also a highlight. This album always gets a bad rap and many say that it marks the official ""selling out"" of KISS. That term is always funny to me, when used with celebrities. Its like fans think that their favorite celebrites are these honest, perfect, ""not in it for the money"" decent folks. KISS makes great music and have an inventive style, who cares what business deals or creative choices they make. The only down fall of this record is that Peter Criss has all but left the group at this point, only playing on ""Dirty Livin'"". The rest of the record has Anton Fig on drums. If you can stand a little disco and deal with the fact that one of the members hardly performed on this record, buy it. Most importantly, hear it for yourself."
4,Another KISS Triumph,"I've been listening to this album for over 20 years and it still has flavor. It's hard, heavy, funky with a little soul and disco seasoned in the mix. Ace finally steps up and takes the lead on the mic, with more leads on this album than Gene! This album also marks the first appearance of the unofficial 5th member of KISS, Anton Fig on drums. Ever song is solid, a true classic.MoPop"
1,Worst Self Help Book I have Ever Purchased,"This is by far the worst self help book I have ever purchased. To put it simply, this book is titled incorrectly. There is only one chapter, 15-20 pages, on financing a business. At no point does the author explain in detail how it is possible to purchase a business for little to no money down. As a matter of fact the author continuously mentions that you need a large cash source to purchase and run a business. If you are looking for an EXTREMELY basic book that outlines the process of buying a business this is for you. If you are looking for a book that will explains how to buy a business with little or no money down, look elsewhere."
1,Find better information online,"I'm not even going to go into how basic and well... bad this book is. I recommend you go search some free websites on how to buy a business, you will learn everything that's in this book and more."
4,Good product,I am pleased with this product. It is well built and good for people who aren't into photography professionally. I say that because it isn't exactly lightweight.Otherwise I am very pleased with its quality.
5,"The more she grates, the more America needs people like her.","Cynthia McKinney is - like so few of her fellow politicians - clear, frank, honest and uncomprimising. She may rattle a few cages, upset some folks on the Hill, but America's children need to see people like her to realize that there is a way to buck the trend, to fight for yours and others rights and to do it selflessly.Highly recommended. I especially liked the clips of a grotesquely coiffered Tucker Carlsen repleat with bow-tie (soooo tacky...) pontificating about the 'outrageous' Cynner. I often wonder if he ever had to take one for the team...."
1,Very poor quality,The Colby flatware looked good upon arrival. However after the first washing it was discovered that almost all of the pieces had rust spots on them. On closer inspection there were numerous defects in the finish on the flatware. I was extremely disappointed after seeing so many good reviews of Reed & Barton flatware. Being over 60 years old I have seen a lot of flatware sets over the years and this is the worst I have seen quality wise.The heft and feel of the flatware is great. To bad.
2,Stamps too small,"I did not realize until I receive it, it is so small, especially for bigger envelope. It is otherwise ok."
5,Great quality and quick order processing,I've purchased a number of these stamps from these folks and they have always delivered a great stamper and fast delivery. You won't go wrong here.
5,Nice product!,"I picked up one of these when I moved to a new house a few months ago. It works great, and the company got it to me in a hurry. I'm back looking at there products because my 7 year old won't leave mine alone. I figure it'll make a great stocking stuffer. Recommended."
5,Moving and inspiring,"The reader who wasn't interested in McCabe's personal life doesn't seem to understand that a memoir is by definition a narrative composed from personal experience. Meeting Sophie is not just about ""the adoption process."" Instead, it eloquently and poignantly demonstrates how becoming a parent--however one accomplishes it--affects all aspects of a life, making other challenges seem larger and at the same time easier to face.A moving and inspiring story."
2,Not a complete adoption story....,"Although this is a wonderfully written story, I was very disappointed that the bulk of the story had little to do with the author's adoption process. As one going through the process of Chinese adoption, I would hope these stories put out as adoption journeys would focus on just that and not the author's personal life outside of adoption. Others may find this interesting and enjoy it, I did not and would not recommend this book to prospective adoptive parents."
2,"a 1,200 watt subwoofer?","This is a well built sub, all but the voice coil. It will not handle the watts it claims to handle. I have a 300 watt sony. And the voice coil is already burning. I only had it for two days. It wasn't moving alot either. the surround looks like it would move alot. this sub looks like it has about 9 or 10 mm of xmax. ( one way). But it peformed like it had only 2 or 3 mm. Lanzar doesn't tell you how much it really has. It does sound good at low volumes. But it's not a high spl sub like it looks. A great box and a very small amp is what you will need for this sub. I will not be buying anymore Lanzar subs. This is my first and will be my last."
4,Gata Lanzar,Do not have them hooked up yet but every review I have read so far says the whole maxpro series are great for the price. Will update when they are in
2,It works,"I purchased one of these about a year ago to add some punch to my garage stereo. It sits in a custom box tunned to 30hz and is powered by a Crown CSL 800 amp in bridged mono configuration. Now i must say it can handle the power and hit frequencies of about 40hz, but the motor noise created is unbearable! (Motor noise is generated as the sleeve slides over the magnet. In some cases poorly built subs the sleeve will bottom out against the housing or even over extend and hit the top of the magnet. These are two events that cause motor noise.) This sub is decent at low volumes, but has been poorly engineered. If your short on cash and are just looking for something to thump then get this, but if you want something that is reliable and accurate sounding then dont go with this product."
1,"junk they blew after 7 days,","after 7 days of light use they blew. Junk, Sounded good before they blew. I was only running 800watt kenwood amp. they subs are rated at 1200 watts."
4,Good Product,Hi I went from having to fosgate p312s with a 1000 watt TMA amp. Untill they blew up on me and I came accross these I have 2 of them in separete boxes about .6 cu ft each with a ma audio 700 watt amp pushing 350 watts rms to each. The amp gain is a 1/3 way up and the bass boost Is all the way down and same on the head unit they are already rattling my truck appart good quality the only problem i had with them is the terminals are cheap and strip out easy thats y its only 4 stars i would recomend this product to any1 looking for a cheap but yet good sound quality subwoofer just watch the terminals when installing.
1,No bueno,"I bought 2 of them to go in a truck box I have, the mounting depth in the description is incorrect they're a good inch and a half deeper than what is stated. These subs are no where near capable of handling 1200 watts, they sound like crap. I had a pair of kicker comps rms 250 watts that I ran with the same amp and everything and they blow these out of the water. Oh and I blew both subs in less than 24 hours just while breaking them in. Save your money."
1,Plants that refuse to grow!,"The blue pots that the plants come with are pretty cute.Unfortunately the peat type soil that the plants are supposed to be grown in is apparently not conducive to plant growth. I tried for months to grow the plants and even replanted some seeds when nothing grew. After many months of regular watering (apparently that's all you're supposed to do) and moving to the best spots of sunlight one of the pots grew plants and I saw the stirrings of life in a second.These grew to approx. 4 inches, withered, grew yellow and died. A strange white fungus like layer formed on top of the peat soil. I threw the entire thing out and have kept the blue pots and blue tray in the hope of trying smg else.Do not buy this. It will not grow."
2,Not a good reference,"If you are inclined to read a book from front to back, this book might not be such a bad buy. But even then, the Verilog treatment seems to be somewhat academic, and does not contain enough real world examples. For example, There is very little treatment of test bench creation, a critical subject in my view. Also, the index is quite poor, and does not seem to have most of what I am looking for."
1,Tithing is not applicable to the New Testament Believer...,"It simply amazes me that ministers, and professed scholars, continue to teach the principle of tithing to New Testament believer's. We are no longer under the old covenant but under the new by the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Here's my question: How many times did Paul teach the principle of tithing? Answer: None. Paul preached specifically in Corinthians on the subject of grace giving, not tithing. As New Testament believer's we are to give as we are led by the Holy Spirit. This is important for you to know: Your ""Blessing"" and the gift of the Holy Spirit come by faith in Christ, and that alone (read Galatians). If you have any further questions and would like the right perspective on this topic please read ""Beyond Tithes and Offerings"" by Michael Webb. .."
4,inspirational work of art,"I thoroughly loved this book, particularly the wonderful commentary. I found myself drawn to their lives and craving to learn more about the ammas. Also the historical perspective of the ever evolving role of women in catholicism was evident and insightful. I also found the dictionary in the back very helpful."
1,Don't buy this book,"If you look at page 191 in the notes for the Appendix titled ""The Ordination Rite of Deacons"" you will see in note #1 that she uses as a reference a website called womenpriests dot org. For any author to use a website as an academic reference for a book would instantly discredit the author in the eyes of the academic community.The translations used for the holy Amma's by the author completely miss the mark and the heart of the Amma's spiritual life. If you want to truly get to the heart of the Amma's (Desert Mother's) and the Abba's (Desert Father's) then I recommend the book ""In the Heart of the Desert: The Spiritualilty of the Desert Fathers and Mothers"" by John ChryssavgisDon't waste your money on this book... get a book that uses true academic scholarship and not 5th hand drivel."
1,not a good choice,"Very disappointing. Seems to be some sort of download copy on cheap paper, with notes indicating unrelated pages, and fuzzy illustration copies in black and white. There are several excellent books of original Raggedy Ann Stories out there, with the original illustrations in beautiful color. I know this because I've searched them out in book stores after receiving this worthless copy, which I could not possibly give as a gift! Skip this one and keep looking."
5,"Sweet stories, sweetly narrated","My daughters, 5 and 3, enjoy listening to this CD of Raggedy Ann Stories, mostly on nights where they are too wound up and need a little more than their usual bedtime routine. The narrator has a pleasant, soothing voice that sounds like she could be Marcella's grandmother. The sweet and simple stories share values and lessons learned by the adventures of Raggedy Ann and her other dollie friends. This CD has inspired my 5 year old to pick out the classic Raggedy Ann books for read alouds. When asked what was her favorite story off of the CD, my daughter said, ""They're all cute, but I like the one where Raggedy Ann helps hatch the baby chicks"". We have both the audio Tapes (Raggedy Ann & Andy Stories) and this unabridged CD, and I prefer the CD's narrator."
1,Shockingly awful,"Unfortunately, you should quickly cancel your order for this one. Ridley must have been ill. One of the worst movies ever. No story. Cheesy special effects. Bad blu-ray. Just awful. Almost as bad as Speed 2."
5,Wonderful and Daring,"The beginning could have been more clear and some of the parts were unnecessary. The topic and the morals this movies have may be contridictory in the religious aspects. But overall, the movie was powerful, the characters well defined, and human virtues and faults are revealed."
4,Enjoyed the movie,Enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to others that like movies about history and the crusades.Three more words needed!
2,Historically Inacurate / Politically Correct,"This was a great film, but if your looking for true history, you will be disappointed. Also, he (Ridley Scott) makes Saladin a hero of sorts and does not mention his massacres at Hattin or the massacres that were about to ensue in Jerusalem. I only wish it would have been more ""politically incorrect"" so it could have been closer to the truth. The majority of the reviewers here are primarily apologetic left-wingers that like things sugar coated. For them, i recommend reading the New York Times Bestseller ""The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and The Crusades) for starters, so they can see what Islam is really about. Thus, this film remains together with Aliens, pure fiction.p.s. I don't subscribe to either religion."
3,It was good but shallow,"Kingdom of Heaven had one of the best production quality that year it came out. The photography, cinematography, and music are good. This is a big screen spectacular.Unfortuanately, the story is pretty boring and the ""good guy"" have so little personality, it is not a very involving experience. The character with the most charisma is played by Liam Neesom and he does not have that much screen time.If you are like me and can appreciate good production quality, it will be worthwhile. If you are like most people and are more interested in a story and it's characters, you will likely be disappointed."
2,Too Slow,This movie was way to slow.I walked into this movie expecting an action packed war movie.I was wrong.This was just 3 hours of talking.All the action in this movie was shown on the previews.The ending of this movie was also pretty lame.I was very dissapointed in this movie.The action looked good but there just wasnt enough.This movie got to much hype.Movie was way to slow.I dont recommend this one.
3,Kingdom of Heaven,"While I really enjoyed the movie I was a little concerned about how the Christians were portrayed compared to Muslims. It was pandering unnecessarily to ""political correctness"" showing Christian Clergy to be corrupt, immoral and fearful by in large and the Muslim to be the opposite. I think that history was being re-written to some extent and I didn't appreciate that part of the movie.Phil Rispin"
3,No special features???,"It looked spectacular! But come ON!!!! It had the original theatrical trailer and that was IT! And having just WATCHED the movie, why do I want to see the trailer??It's called Blu-Ray, and it's supposed to hold 16-32gigs! It should have the decency to include some decent special features!"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:As for as the theatrical version is concerned, Kingdom of Heaven is a big glorious mess of a movie--it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but it has its share of enjoyable scenes."
4,Awesome!,Great movie! If you have only seen the theatrical this is very very very different. costs $9.95 at Wal-mart though...
4,An interesting plot with a little history thrown in for good measure,"We recently rented this movie and, to our surprise given the reviews, really enjoyed it. While it is ""hollywood"", there is enough historical fact and genuine character development to keep it from being just another battle-scene movie. The romance, while a bit fanciful, added an interesting spark to please ""everyone"".I say watch it and enjoy. It is a very entertaining movie with some excellent acting and a few grains of historical fact."
3,Good entertainment bad facts.,If I did not know much about the historical facts I would have given this a 4 or 5. Good action movie.
4,Underrated.,"Yes, Gladiator is better. Yes, Orlando Bloom can be annoying. Yes, the first half hour of this movie is a little corny and could have played out better, but this movie is very good. The locations, characters, battles are all stunning and contribute to Ridley Scott's vision of the crusades in Jerusalem. Unfortunately this DVD doesn't have a commentary by Scott, but some of the procuction footage is cool to watch and the 2 seperate documentaries about the real life crusades are interesting. This movie might not be perfect, but it's still very good and worthy of at least one view by any Ridley Scott fan."
3,Entertaining piece of fiction...but where's the prequel?,"Ridley Scott is a talented filmmaker but, as any historian knows, this movie is a work of fiction based very loosely on some historical events.And when's the prequel coming out?? When will Mr. Scott favor us with a rousing rendition of the real first ""crusade"" when invading Muslims conquered Jerusalem from the Byzantines in 638AD under Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattb? Jerusalem fell only after Umar had taken Mesopotamia and parts of Persia from the Sassanids and taken Egypt, Palestine, Syria, North Africa and Armenia from the Byzantines.Surely Mr. Scott knows, as does any high-schooler who can read history, that the Christian ""crusades"" were in response to growing mistreatment of Christians in Jerusalem and pilgrims on the road to Jerusalem, perceived or real.So, Mr. Scott: please favor us with your enormous talents in making the prequel!"
3,Entirely a work of fiction.,"If you're expecting to see an accurate depiction of this era you won't find it here. If you're looking for escapist costume entertainment with obvious bias, this is it. Great acting by Orlando Bloom."
3,Perhaps a Little Too Historically Correct,"The movie industry has been well-known for taking books and history and changing it to suit their cinematic needs. Kingdom of Heaven isn't one of those films, and after watching it, I now know why directors and writers change things. While it isn't entirely true (some of the early scenes in the movie were fake), most of it is, including the characters and battles that happens. It does keep your interest all the way up until the end, where it will then leave you feeling a little cheated. Without spoiling much, I can say that this is where the director Ridley Scott should have applied the Hollywood touch.This is a great movie for those who love world history or for those who love epics (like me). Beyond that, I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Very excited about this...,"To the person who accused Digital Bits and IGN of posting fake reviews... the director's cut was shown in LA at two different theatres over the last few months. These two sites are not alone in their praise... a number of reviewers have made similar comments about the director's cut. And it really is a shame.I for one am excited about this. I read the original script, and there's a ton of great stuff that misses the theatrical stuff and really undermines the story. It was a real shame, because it could have been an oscar worthy epic.Ku"
2,A secular Hollywood movie about religion? Please.,"Lets go see this movie because Orlando Blooms in it!Please Hollywood. This movie is so off it's not even funny. They do everything they can not to offend anyone. Blooms character would be seen as an infidel. He also does not become a great fighter after 5 minutes of lessons from his father. He says he has no religion, so why even go to Jerusalem?A fiction movie to attract Orlando Bloom fans all for the $$$$$. It's not bad but it's not accurate either. It takes place long ago with todays politically correct thoughts. Stick with the History Channels look at the Crusades for educating. Watch this to be entertained."
4,"Great photography, no English subtitles","Plot is surreal, sort of magic realism. Reminds of Erendira. Photography is beautiful. No subtitles, which is a pity because the sound is not great."
2,Mellow Mendelssohn,The Mendelssohn Trios are well played yet don't expect the sound to be state of the art. These were recorded years ago and it is what it is. Wonderful literature to hear but mellow like sound. Ron Houser
2,Excellent compilation Showcasing A Wonderful Singer,"Lesley Gore - a name closely associated with all wonderful memories of growing up. Lesley has always been an underated artist both in England and Australia. When I am asked ""Lesley who?"" I simply play this complilation and, hey presto, another fan! An excellent compilation that shows all the love and care that has gone into its production. Lesley has recently toured here in Australia and is sounding better than ever. It is great to be able to play the golden oldies over and over knowing that, unlike the vinyl, the cd will not wear out. Thank you for giving me the chance to share Lesley's wonderful talents with an upcoming generation."
2,plants,2 were dead when arrived & the other 2 didn't last much longer-- not worth trying to get my money back
1,"Ettler, go home","This was the most pointless book I have ever read, and one of those rare ones I wish I hadn't read at all, not even as a learning experience. I just didn't get anything out of it whatsoever. Bad style, bad ideas, bad story. I'm sorry there was no zero-star option."
4,Breathless,"A Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing crossed with Jean Baudrillard, Marilyn's Almost Terminal New York Adventure is a clever funny romp of a novel, a real girl's tale. Loved Marilyn's TV allergy and all the fun references to movie stars and famous writers. The lack of punctuation is a little tricky at first but you get used to it. Breathlessly fast, it's almost like reading a film script. Did for my mind what her first book The River Ophelia did for my body."
2,Bordering on pornographic,"I am deeply disappointed in this tale that I expected to be more uplifting and spiritual. Instead all I got was page after page of a hot steamy love affair of two teens/young adults. Their attraction was more physical than soulful. It must have been as the author devoted more pages to their sex life than anything else! I am not against a sexual novel. I just want to know that is what I am reading up front instead of being marketed a spiritual novel. Granted I haven't gotten to the very end yet where the plot comes together but that is because I am over 3/4 of the way through and the spiritual side of the plot is very slow to come about in full force! I am having trouble forcing myself to pick it back up and finish it. When and if I do and ""the end justifies the means"" I will be the first to rewrite a review rescinding this one.ladyfishjg from NH"
5,Inspires me every time I read it!,"This book gives insight rarely available. Details on the recording procedure, not just Bealtle cliches. The only drawback is, Emerick is obviously a Paul admire and has ill feelings for George, not passing any opportunity to criticize a very creative guitarist. Makes also Ringo seem at times pathetic. All in all, from a musician's and a fan's point of view, a MUST have."
3,Not bad,"I was interested in reading this book, but once I got it, I found most of it to be rather hard to believe. Apparently, if Geoff Emerick hadn't been in the control room, the Beatles would have gone the way of the Archies. I'm not denigrating the contributions to the Beatles recordings that Emerick obviously made, but some of the things he says about Georges Martin and Harrison are more than a little hard to believe. A fair book, not much more."
4,Nice look inside the studio,"Interesting look inside the studio, but don't expect any insider info.He has most to say about Paul, and relatively little about the others."
5,Great book behind the Beatles' recordings,This book gives a great behind-the-scenes view of recording the Beatles. I love it.
3,"A great read, regardless of some of the criticism","Some of the accuracy of the information recalled in this book has been called into question by another Abbey Road staff member who was there at the time as well. Even taking into consideration the possibility that there may be factual errors, it's still enjoyable to read about the experience from Mr. Emerick's point of view. I find the meticulously accurate information in ""Recording the Beatles"" (by Brian Kehew and Kevin Ryan) to be indispensable, however ""Here, There and Everywhere"" has the element of personal experience that makes it charming, taking the reader back in time."
2,S_Hughes,"This is installed in a 2003 VW Jetta. It is slow to acknowledge the iPhone when plugged in, and the different modes to allow control from the iPhone once plugged in are buggy. Lots of button pushing required both on the OEM radio and on the iPhone each time you plug it in. Definitely not as transparent as the VW provided aftermarket solution that I had in another MKIV vehicle."
3,Appalachia Isn't For Me!,"The book was o.k., but who really wants to read a book about four children trying to keep a secret about their dad dying. I'm really not into Appalachian culture anyway. It was well written but it's just not my kind of book. But don't let me give you a bad impression. If you like Appalachian culture, it's the book for you."
4,where the lillies bloom,I belive that it was a whell ritten book and very intresting reading abought wildcrafting and how they made it thew the Winter.
5,A Wonderful Book AND Movie!,This is a wonderful book about the unique challenges of life in North Carolina's Smokey Mountains for 14-year-old Mary Call Luther and her brother and sisters. A heart warming book for all ages... great to read with kids. Be sure to rent the movie after!
2,You Can Play the Ukulele bydon Ball,"I gave this only two stars because it is not designed for the most common tuning used today. It has a nice selection of songs, but be aware they are all for D (ADF#B) tuning. Sometimes songs chorded for D tuning sound fine when played on a uke in C (GCEA) tuning, but these do not. Unless you are happy with D tuning, there are more useful books. If you like D tuning, however, this is a nice volume for the price."
3,Another Jessica adventure,"Hello,when I owned this book it was a different cover..it showed Jess with black hair and she looked like a dragqueen..really ugly. This is a story about Jessica wanting to look different to her twin Elizabeth and deciding to go exotic.She dyes her hair black and dresses all posh like.Then a model agent comes to town and Jess tries to get a job from him,but he says he is looking for an all-californian blonde!And he chooses Elizabeth!Then Poor jessie cant get him to believe that the 2 of them are twins!!!Pretty funny."
1,don't buy,"The bean bag chair just arrived. I am so disappointed: The stuffing is totally inadequate to fill the chair and when I unzipped the liner to see if I could add additional stuffing, I found there to be no inner liner, hence the little balls flew all over. I bought this for my grandson who is 10, I bought one from another source for his brother that arrived at the same time. The other bean bag chair is far superior, and the costs were nearly the same...However, the Saints Bean bag chair will now cost me MUCH more by the time I buy additional filler and try to find or make a liner, and spend time chasing after the materials. The only good feature on this is the Saints logo and if he didn't specifically ask for a Saints Bean Bag Chair, I'd send it back. I do not recommend the purchase."
3,Easy read,"This is an interesting book if you are looking for some light reading. It reads as if it is geared toward business owners and manufactors but is obviously dumbed down for the general public. It makes me suspicious about some of the analysis of ""consumers"". Is this book just trying to make us feel okay about our consumption? It is a little too flattering at times. I tend to believe that a book written for manufactors and retailers might be much more harsh towards our out of control consumption."
5,A Surprisingly Interestng Read,"[...] I thought the premise of the book sounded interesting but I suspected that it might be a bit dry and dull but this book was very enjoyable. I was surprised to discover that my lifestyle of bargain hunting in some areas so I could splurge on others was so common. This book describes how the middle range of products is drying up and people want either super cheap or high end. It also discusses the business model behind companies like Aldi, Ebay and Bath and Body Works. Since reading this book, I find that I pay more attention people's shopping habits. The vast majority of people I know are described in this book. Plus, I found out about the great deals available at Aldi! Give this book a try - I think you'll really like it."
5,Any Advertising Rep should read this,This book should interest you especially if you are in the field of advertising. This book gives you insight into the psychology of buying. I found it very interesting as to how the new consumer ticks. There is a reasson why people buy what they do and you'll find out the information in this book. I applied the knowledge I gained in this book to my business. Great insight.
5,great product!!!,"I buy these vitamens for my son who is very active. I find that since these don't have any sugar, he gets the nutrition he needs, but not the sugar high that makes him bounce off the walls. I would definitely recommend this product."
2,Not useful without MANY CEUs,"I'm a licensed massage therapist (3 years) and massage instructor at a local school. When I bought this book, I thought I'd come away with some practical information that I could apply to my practice immediately. Well, after reading it I don't feel that at all. In fact, I feel that it may be another 10 years before I can become proficient in all the modalities that Weintraub combines to achieve his reported results. Among the courses I'll need to certify in are Acupressure, myofascial release, Body-Mind Centering and visceral manipulation. He's been doing this for 30+ years and I don't feel he has been able to write a book that can teach this method, though he successfully describes the myriad skills needed to practice it. ..."
3,Here's the overview:,"This is the synopsis from the back cover of the studio's screener DVD: Joe and his siblings have a couple of problems. First off, their stepparents are despicably evil. Secondly, they appeared to have killed them. Now this mixed up mess of half-sisters and step-brothers have to figure out how to dispose of the bodies, cover up the murders, collect their grandfather's inheritance and somehow stick together as a family - all without getting caught. Not to mention the eldest Joe's obsessive need to keep tabs on his promiscuous sister, an eye on the precocious little ones and a lustful watch on the girl next door.Growing up has its complications. Murder's just one of them."
3,"More of the same, but entertaining","The only exceptional story I found in here was Last of the Winnebagos. While the others were entertaining, they were frequently light on content and very predictable. If you love Connie Willis, you'll like this. If you haven't read her writing before, I'd start with something more substantial like The Doomsday Book instead."
5,Jimmy hall sings the blues,"I bought this CD after I was restocking some old music and wanted a Wet Willie CD with Keep On Smilin. I discovered Jimmy Hall, lead singer was still alive and well and had a couple of new CDs out. I really like this CD and about a year after I bought it Jimmy Hall showed up near me in Thomson GA for the Blind Willie Blues Festival. It was a fantastic day, Jimmy Hall and the Prisoners of Love performed. Jack Pearson who plays guitar on this CD was there and they made a great team. Even better to hear Rendezvous with the Blues live on a hot Georgia day in the middle of basically a well groomed cow pasture. At 62 he can still belt it out and sounds better live than on records. I am a total fan and have purchased anything I can find with his music on it."
2,A Disappointment,"Compared to Karajan's 1976 recording of this most profound of symphonies, Walter's late recording is nothing less than disappointing. He tends to rush through some of the more contemplative passages and fails to reveal the inherent luminosity and spiritual depth of this work. Needless to say, Walter's Hollywood recording orchestra is not a patch on the Berlin Philharmonic. This is not the best version of this work by far."
4,The Art of Prayer by Timothy Jones,"The Author is easy to relate to,unpretentious and practical in his advise on prayer throughout the book. You'll walk through his daily route with him, you will even accompany him on his morning jog from time to time!He is frank and honest about his feelings on prayer and shares several beautifuly written eloquent forms with the reader throughout his book. Mr.Jones knows his bible verses and interjects them nicely into his many life stories. The end of the book offers exercises involving scripture so the reader can hone his own skills as well.I think this is a good read particularly for men, but all would enjoy."
1,"Vignette, not a book","I believe the publishers misrepresented the book. The cover and reviews portray the work as an analysis of post-2001 Afghanistan, and an indictment of the errors of the US military and the Afghan government. The book focuses on the governor and police chief of Kandahar from 2002-2005. The book does describe Ms. Chayes' experience working for an NGO, but never covers the political-military situation, and charges of U.S. government mismanagement that the publisher advertises. It seems an incomplete ramble on the injustices of political reality in Kandahar, and provides no new insight into what has always been perceived as a corrupt and ineffective Afghan government, and a meddlesome Pakistani government that is often at odds with U.S. goals."
4,Grade A B's,"Discounting Mr Geneva's dementia, it's noteworthy when a band can release ""B"" sides that are superior to 98% of the ""A"" sides by other 90's ensembles. Although a tad uneven, Like Cats and Dogs showcase the amazing sonic depths and heights this Brit foursome attained at the peak of their creative career. Buy this after you've digested their great studio albums (minus Wishville.) I also agree with other reviewers: give it a few spins, for CW is an aquired taste well worth time and effort. CW makes music that convey emotions and ideas; LC&D contains the grade ""A"" remnants of their hard-to-classify, yet diversely amazing studio efforts from 1992 to 1997. An interesting cover of Rush's ""Spirit of Radio"" is a nice unlisted plus, with Rob Dickenson wisely not attempting to emulate the screechy Geddy L of yore. Baileyboy"
1,Christmas Box Video Review,This is a very excellent sentimental movie that would touch the heart of anyone viewing it. Very worthwhile and recommended for all audiences
5,Wahl Stable Prto Clipper,"A great set of clippers! I use mine on my dogs...Had a set that lasted 20 + years, hope these are as good!"
2,Apple is losing market share fast,"My second IPOD in 2 years broke only weeks after the warranty ended. The apple store told me my only option was to buy a new one. Now why would I do that if the previous two broke after only 1 year? Cause they want to make MONEY!! Not make customers happy. There are many other brands that are better than Apple. And for goodness sake, don't pay retail for one. Get one used for half the price if you absolutely have to have an IPOD."
5,"Perhaps the best, surely the most intense, McGee story","I have read the entire McGee series and am now working my way through the unabridged audiobooks which were published by books on tape.This is perhaps the simplest plot of the entire series. The fewest characters. No visit from Meyer, the economist.Just three good guys, some medium bad guys, and one really memorable, but believable, super bad guy.John MacDonald demonstrates that a uncomplicated and realistic plot with great and convincing characterizations is a much better read than a complicated, hard to believe plot. When you finish, you will muse that this could have been true, and suspect the author heard the germ of this story over a few beers in South Florida 50 years ago."
2,weak sauce,"i am a longtime fan of daniel quinn, but this book was a waste of money. at least it only took about 15 minutes to read the entire book.have you ever had a band you like release a collection of b-sides or unknown songs? almost like they needed money and didn't have any new material?? and they knew that their early songs were so popular that their fans would buy anything they put out??? well, here you have daniel quinn's unreleased pile of junk rolled into a new album with nice cover art. just like your favorite band has songs that didn't make the final album version, these stories probably should have remained on the cutting room floor. at least it's short..."
4,Inventive,These intresting characters will draw you in as you get to know them. I loved the living in Walmart concept. The story keeps evolving and is rarely dull. It just flows all the way.
2,"easy reading, but characters uninteresting.","While this book was easy to read, I didn't find myself not being able to put it down. In comparison to Oprah's other selections (eg, Stones from the River, I Know This Much is True), it falls flat. Novalee seemed too perfect, and even through she faces hard times at different points in the book, she comes out on top, always, and I found that extremely unrealistic. I couldn't identify with that. The other characters were two-dimensional, where they could have been developed (Lexie, Forney). Overall, very dissapointed."
2,Don't waste your money,"This book stunk. I didn't care about the characters at all. I didn't care what happened and couldn't finish it because it was so boring. I wouldn't bother with the book, maybe the movie will be better..."
2,Nice outline,"Yes, this is a nice outline but I'm still waiting for the fully developed story and characters. Seems the author spent her time finding quirky names for her people (one more cute name and I would have thrown the book out) and did actually find herself ""stumbling from one chapter to another, from one event to another"", as she states in the ""Q & A"" with the author. Several major events occur but Ms. Leitts is happy to just drop us off a cliff. Oh, what a big, rich book this could have been had the author made the effort."
5,Best book ever,this is a wonderful book. The characters were great the plot was excellent and I literally could not put it down. I read the whole thing in about 3 hours it was that good.
5,BEST BOOK I EVER READ,This was an amazing book! I got so involved in the plot and wanted it to go on forever. I only wished the book was longer because I wanted to know more about Novalee and Americus.
1,Light read yet still with haunting scenes thrown in.,"I read this book because Oprah said it was not as dark as the other novels she had chosen. Granted, most of it was pretty light weight and predictable. But there were still scenes that kept me from sleeping and had me checking on my kids all night. Are there no novels without topics like child abuse involved? If you don't want dark pictures invading your sleep, I suggest you skip this one."
4,Where The Heart Is For Me,"In Where The Heart Is, we believe Billie Letts displays a teriffic situation of damaged love healed. We enjoyed getting to see Novalee finally find love after all the trials and hardships she was faced with in the beginning of the story, with Willie Jack leaving her pregnant and alone at Wal-Mart. We thought the idea of someone living in Wal-Mart was so far fetched, yet it really made you think about the posssibility of it happening in real life because of the extreme role Wal-Mart plays in everybody's life. The idea of Novalee living in Wal-Mart really brought the story to life for us.Novalee knew, even after all she had been through, she could still turn her life into a success. This is one reason why we believe you should read this book because we all have some kind of success story in our lives."
5,Totally entertaining !!,I read this book before Oprah and I loved it !! I was hooked by the first sentence. A must read --
1,"No, no, no","We read this in my book discussion group and it keeps coming up when we discuss other, better books we read. For example, the characters in Where the Heart Is are flat: They're either saintly or evil. Instead try Wicked, a novel that turns the Wicked Witch of the West into a sympathetic, human character. I'm only giving Where the Heart Is a star because the form won't take a blank."
3,Enjoyed the book... Quick read,"I found Where the Heart Is to be an interesting, entertaining novel with rich characters such as Forney Hull, Moses Whitecotten and Sister Husband that are all positive examples of good, kind, intellegent people... they do exist, not just in books! However I did not care for Lexie. I did not feel her character was well developed. I felt no positive spirit. Also, the unfortunate tragedy experienced by her children due to her own mistake and lack of sense was unnecessary and I saw no positive outcome or resolution to the problems it created."
2,easy to read,"Very easy to read, something to slip right into and read in one go. It had the quality of that which is surreal, though, and never really impacted. This wasn't helped by names such as 'Americus' and 'Sister Husband', tornadoes, and babysnatchings. Still, it traced the growth and strength of Novalee in an uplifting way and made you feel good."
5,Literary genious.Really got you in touch with the characters,The book kept my attention and my eyes never strayed from the pages during the time I spent reading it because I got so wrapped up in the storyline and plot that I felt almost an attachment to the characters. I felt their pain and anguish during different events in the story.
3,It is different.,"Being a thirteen year old teenager who doesn't like serious fiction books, Where The Heart Is is one anybody could read. It gives deepening parts that could recleanse the soul, and other parts could give you chills to your arms. The makes you think, ""What would I do if I were her."" It makes you embrassive like a soap opera, and exiciting like an action movie. It's poetic. It's inspiring. Most of all the book portrays the life of many young girls with life changing problems. In this case it relates to a girl who was pregnant at seventeen, and she gets a guy who treats her like garbage. Like many girls with this problem, the man gets a young girl pregnant. Then he gets himself in another young ""victim."" This book could be read by people who like romance novels. It could be read by men. In general you could recommend this book to anyone."
1,Doesn't quite make the grade,This book is too superficial and sappy to really satisfy. The characters could be interesting if they weren't either completely perfect or completely evil. A more balanced and realistic approach would have been preferable.
5,Couldn't put it down!,This book was the most inspirational book I have ever read. Novalee went through so much and still came out on top. ONce I started reading I couldn't stop. I read the whole thing in one sitting.
2,An okay read if you have nothing better to select from.,"This poor girl has more bad luck than is believable. The character names were also pretty unbelievable. I did not find this book to be very witty or entertaining. I did find it to be rather a ho-hum read. Definitely not worth the purchase price. Come on Oprah, you can pick better books than this....there are plenty of them out there!!"
1,Vapid and Insipid,"I am amazed at the positive response this novel is getting! I did not realize that this was an Oprah-sanctioned read when I purchased it--I guess that explains some of it.How sugary sweet, isn't life wonderful, blah, blah, blah! Just what I want to read about.As a general rule, I abstain from Oprah's books."
1,"Corny, false, and overrated.","I wanted to like this book, but almost from the first page I felt manipulated by the cutesy, one-dimensional characters and the fake-feeling ""set pieces"" of the plot. The author pounds away at ""warm and fuzzy,"" and the dents are obvious throughout. The action was fairly well-paced, but hardly unpredictable. This book is best suited to people who don't mind having their heartstrings plucked in the most artless of ways."
2,Hollywood will like this one,"I really wanted to like this book. The writing is deft and flowing, and I wish thie world was as sweet as this book, but it is not. Billie skims over her characters' lives, too many are just cute eccentrics with little or no substance. Worse, however, is the shameless and predictable manipulation of the reader's feelings. Perhaps I am an old cynic, but our dear Novalee is just a bit too perky for me. Oddly, this character also appeared in Stephen King's Bag of Bones, also with the cutest daughter, also falling in love with a middle aged man..somehow, perhaps wrongly, I feel these writers are patronizing these women by making them a little too sweet and ernest. This is not a bad book, just very dissapointing."
5,A wonderful book!,This is an uplifting story with characters so alive you feel you know them. I didn't want it to be over. Read this book!
4,An easy read,This is the first novel I picked up after many months of not reading one. It is a surprisingly easy read and the characters simply flow very naturally from the first page. The characters seem so real that I wish I was living in that same area right now.
4,Great Vacation Read,"I read this book on my vacation from school and I thought it was great! I agree with the reader below that it was a little cheesy, but it was a relaxing, easy read, and I don't think there's anything wrong with a little cheese every now and then. The characters were very three dimensional for me, and I was so relieved to read something that didn't end up utterly depressing me by the end for once. If you're looking for a nice light, interesting read, try Where the Heart Is..."
2,bubble gum book,"I found myself wanting to keep reading to find out what happened, but at the same time not believing how incredibly HOKIE it was! (example-Sam Walton visiting Novalee in the hospital) I was very surprised Oprah picked this out out of all the books that could be chosen and how are they possibly going to make a movie out of it? If this is the best book so many people have ever read I feel sad for them. It just felt to me like Letts was trying too hard in her writing or that she would write any unbelievable thing to sound original. Didn't work for me."
4,one of oprah's few hits,"Oprah's book club has done a lot for the state of contemporary literature, though most of her picks aren't that great. But every now and then she'll pick a good book. Where the Heart Is is one of those good books. It's a sweet story, without becoming saccharine. It's got a great hook--a pregnant woman lives and gives birth in a small town Wal-Mart. Who wouldn't read that? Letts gives you great characters that you can't help but care for in spite of yourself. Letts does flirt with the boundaries of cliche and emotionalism at times, but she never quite crosses that boundary--too badly at least. It's a good book."
1,"Superficial, ridiculous","This book is a real chore to read. You have to endure sleazy characters with nauseating names behaving in subhuman manner. I would not want to know these people in real life, nor would I want to read about them again. Please, Oprah, with all the good books out there, why did you choose this?"
3,Uninspiring,"I'm always amazed when I read other people's review and they have an entirely different experience. Where the heart is, seems to be one of those. It was an easy read, but very uninspiring all around. The charachters were rather flat, the plot was weak and the writing was average."
4,"Read it!!! ""Just for the fun of it""","I don't understand why ANYONE would write a review like some I've read here. This book was a joy to read..nothing heavy, nothing to think too hard about. Just a more updated, more sophisticated version of ""Pollyanna"". And isn't Polyanna a ""classic?"""
5,beautifully written,"This book was soooo good! I couldnt even put it down. It appeals to all ages., but also teaches many lessons. Some of the lessons are obvious and yet some are not so obvious. It is a heartwarming story that touches exactly where it should, the heart."
5,It's about time Oprah got it right!,"To me, Oprah missed the boat with ""Heaven on Earth,"" ""She's Come Undone,"" ""The Story of Ruth,"" and ""Deep End of the Ocean."" I read them all and found each one lacking.""Where The Heart Is,"" however hits on all levels. I come from a town too small for a Wal-Mart, but my neighbors are the kind that would take in a 17 year-old, 7-month pregnant girl like Novalee.I love Novalee's resourcefullness and her ""never say die"" attitude. Her strange array of friends were delightful.The only thing that struck me odd was how long it took Novalee to find true love. For someone as needy as she was, she sure was blind...love was right under her nose all the time.This is a book I will read again. I don't say that often or lightly.Enjoy!"
3,Young girl pregnant stranded at a Wal-Mart with bare hands,"This story is about a seven teen year old pregnant girl, named Novalee Nation, who plans to move to California with her boyfirend to find a better life. Her boyfriend ends up leaving her stranded at a Wal-Mart with only $10 in hand and memory full of dreams. As he continued his journey to California by car negative incidents were happening to him while for Novalee things were going her way. Throughout the story you never know what is gonna happen next and Letts keeps you wondering what will occur next to Novalee."
4,Uplifting.,"I must admit that after reading a few of Oprah's Bookclub selections and being very dissapointed I was prepared for the worst but I actually enjoyed this book. It was full of hope and strength and love, as well as some of the most wonderful characters you are likely to meet. The only problem I had with it is that it finished too soon."
2,"Lots of heart, flat characters","Novalee seemed to drag as a character. Perhaps, she was more take than give which bothered me. The Wal Mart experience should have been lengthened. How did she dodge the nightwatch, the janitor? How did inventory account for the missing clothes and food? Willy Jack was an interesting character, although he was the villain. Forney was too good to be true. In spite of these traits, the book reads fast and has memorable instances (the tornado, Jolene's bar scene, and the tragic chapter 29)."
1,Fantasy Island,"I read this book for a book discussion club. The book is trite and obvious. Poor, ignorant, pregnant teenage girls turning out to be loving, competent and intelligent mothers... violent, drunken, lazy red necks see the error of their ways..reclusive bookworms find joy and love..the rich and educated are really villans..and every minorty character is warm, kind and welcoming. Politically correct fantasy."
1,Shallow book about white trash,"I will never refer to ""[...]Book Club"" again. I can't believe this book received so many high recommendations. It was shallow, interspersed with crudity."
4,A moving tale of how people should treat each other,"This was a great book! I was a little skeptical at first, but the warmth of the characters and the way they opened up to each other was inspirational. It made me want to move out of L.A. and head for a small town, where I could find people like that!"
4,A charming and tragic tale with a touch of innocence,I found this book to be touching and sweet. The characters are well defined and you really get a taste of life in the heartland of America. The ending needs a little more exploration by the author.
3,"down to earth, moving, emotional, real","It was wonderful to see the characters in this book grow, learn and love eachother in ways most human beings don't think possible."
4,Triumphant and courageous,It took me 4 days to read this book cover to cover. The star of the book is a smart and courageous young lady and mother who made a life for herself and touched other lives in the process. The story is about triumph and willpower.
4,Friends and Family... what a gift !,"I also agree with ""Happiness and Heartache"". Where The Heart Is , by Billy Letts, was a well- written novel. This book wonderfully portrays the main character, Novalee Nation, and how she struggles through life. I love the way Novalee came into this small town and everyone was so friendly with her and because they were friendly with her. They influenced her life for the better. This book makes you realizes families and friends are very important, to should never turn your back on them. I enjoyed reading this book and I highly recommend it."
3,I think this book wasn't all it could've been.,"This book was very boring! It could've been better.The beginning was very good but when i got to the middle I got really bored and towards the end wasn't that good either.It could've been more challenging to read.Those are the types of books I like.They have to be challenging causing you to want to read more.I'm not trying to say Billie Letts isn't a good writer,BUT it could've been better."
2,DRIVEL,Not my type of novel. If you want interesting Southern 'life lessons' read Frannie Flagg or Rebecca Wells. Both have much more style and flair than Billie Letts. Novalee et al were cardboard cutout characters. Such that you would find in Walmart. How fitting.
4,This novel has heart...,"This is a refreshing and entertaining read. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll laugh and cry at the same time. Its the story of Novalee Nation - a girl who has no luck with the number 7.The tale spins masterfully through several crucial years of her life. This is a 'love triumphs' tale that isn't pie-in-the-sky stuff, but real life. You'll be drawn into the story, and you'll root for the characters.First book I've read by Ms. Letts, but I think I'll keep an eye out for other titles that come from her! A reading!"
1,What a bunch of junk. Slow and unrealistic!,"This book was SO boring and unrealistic I tossed it before I even finished. Normally, once I begin a book I feel compelled to finish, however, I allowed myself this mistake & returned the book. How a story like this could entertain so many people is beyond me...."
3,"Likable characters, but too cartoonish; try Kingsolver","This novel has its moments, without a doubt, and Novalee Nation is an irrepressible character who charms you. Billie Letts' focus on the Walmart subculture in America is also intriguing. However, for the most part, this story of a poor white pregnant girl in search of home and family lacks credibility. Character depth is shallow, even cartoonish, and the novel's conflicts are resolved in a simplistic manner. The one blatant act of realism in the book is shocking, not just because of the brutality of the scene, but because of Letts' almost off-handed way of resolving its consequences. For a true look at down-on-their luck characters who are worthy of your love and affection (as well as your laughter,) I recommend Barbara Kingsolver."
3,The first book about instruction in martial arts- but...,For me this book is a little too heavy- too scientific - I'm teaching children most of the time - This book will enrich our knowledge beyond instructions - I like this book but I think I need to read and read again to catch the idea and use it in my class.
1,Clearly biased and based off of opinion-NOT A GOOD TEXTBOOK,"Clearly the author of this book is a burn your bra feminist. Some of the things mentioned in this book was totally liberal, and politically motivated. Some of the things she says are totally false and not based off of REAL science. This book is CRAP. If it's required for a class, make sure you buy the LEAST inexpensive one and do what you have to do to pass the class."
1,readings unreliable....,"bought this model to replace one of the self inflating ones purchased 2 weeks before this one.(not from amazon) Sent that one back because of overly high andunreliable readings. Based on select reviews about this one, thought this mighthave been a better choice. I have really high BP, so accurate readings beforechanging meds are extremely important to me. After a few days trial with this onei'm sorry to say the same problem exists. i.e. error readings, and extreme fluctuation of readings. Systolic to high, diastolic to low. Have older modelOmron, that use to be pretty accurate, but due to it's age(approx. 10yrs.) thoughtit should be replaced. But that one is still more accurate than the 432C. Whenyou have HIGH BP, you cannot afford to not feel confident of your readings."
1,Omron blood pressure machine,"I am very disappointed in this product. I didnt have occasion to use it for several weeks and by the time I did, the return window had expired. It registers an error reading every time I use it. I have followed all the proper instructions but to no avail.Unfortunately, I'm stuck with a defecticve product."
4,really quite good,"I was also a technical reviewer for the book, and really liked it. Even considering the price of the book, I think it's quite valuable, because it explains the basics of so many topics in a manner that makes sense. If you are new to programming and would like to try out different things to see what you might like, such as web programming, XML, designing windows (lowercase 'w') that will work on a variety of platforms, databases, sockets, etc., you may find that this book provides material you would otherwise look through a literal stack of books to find. No programming book is perfect, but I think this one is pretty good."
2,Slang....,"THIS IS A HUGE LET DOWN!!!! I Liked nothing, not even the title track. Stick to your roots, guys, and I'll remain faithful... PLEASSEE...!!!!"
3,"An interesting experiment, quickly abandoned","Okay, so you have the metal Def Leppard for the first three albums and the pop Def Leppard for the next two. ""Slang"" was made by the trying-to-be-trendy Def Leppard. However, it's not as total a departure as many of my fellow reviewers would have you think--Joe Elliott's voice and Phil Collen's guitar are too distinctive. The good songs are great, namely the grungy ""Truth?"", the sitar-flavored ""Turn To Dust,"" and the throbbing ""Work It Out."" The bad songs . . . well, that's what the skip button on the CD player is for. It should be noted, however, that on their recent tour they only played one song from ""Slang"", the title track, which is the only song that sounds like vintage Def Leppard. And of course they hopped right back on the pop metal bandwagon with the excruciating ""Euphoria."" If Leppard thought to win new fans with ""Slang,"" it didn't work, but compared to ""Euphoria,"" which sounds like a bad retread of ""Adrenalize,"" ""Slang"" is decent."
2,Not their best album,Def Leppard is my favorite band of all time.But every band has that one bad album. This is that one bad album.
4,wowzers!¡!,"Def-Leppard goes Alternative. you can tell Mutt Lange isn't on this CD. i love this effort.the earlier stuff sound all the same (like another Mutt's band AC/DC). the tracks i liked is ""we can work it out"" and the title track. also i feel it soundz a little like college rock. i haven't heard the ""new"" Def'sCD yet..but i hope it soundz like this one.i sorely miss Steve Clark's axe. looking at the liner notes..the new hair style looks alternative.( joe does look a little like Kurt Cobain).anywayz...i recomand this one to any rock-alternative fan."
5,Great purchase!!,"I was amazed how quickly and safely it got to my home. I was a little nervous ordering a guitar over the internet for fear it would be damaged during shipping. The seller did a great job securely boxing it up and it got here without a scratch. I am impressed with the quality of the guitar overall, even though only an amateur I recognize quality when I see it."
3,Adequate pacifier,"Get me near a Good 'n Plenty box or a Switzer's Bites bag of any size and it's gone. Even though I don't know if I'm gluten intolerant, I thought I'd try to mitigate any potentially harmful health effects from the habit. Let's not kid ourselves. There's no mistaking these for the real thing--there's just enough molasses taste competing (successfully) with the licorice flavor to make me wish I'd tested for gluten intolerance before ordering them. Moreover, Amazon requires you to order a minimum of five bags. The upside is that they do appear to purge the urge to eat more licorice--in fact, 1-2 pieces seems quite enough to satisfy the palette for the whole day. I haven't done the math, but I have a hunch these five bags will hold me through the summer if not longer."
5,Master of Cellists ... or Cello Up Your ---,"Ok, I was skeptical ... How the hell are cellos going to carry off Metallica, and not just the ""pretty"" stuff but the ugly crunchy stuff, that we all know and love ... Ok, first question, how the f*** do they get a cello to sound like that? ... #2 this urge to headbang to cellos, what's that about??? (yes you feel very self-conscious when the urge arises) ... In all seriousness, this CD captures the spirit of the songs, and is worth a checkout if you like Metallica"
4,Great for First CD,"The only reason I would have to take away a star from this GREAT cd is that I've heard their two more recent releases, Inquisition Symphony and Cult where they have a more evolved and heavier sound plus original songs. But except for that this is a wonderful cd. I play cello and like Metallica as well, but when I heard about Plays Metallica By Four Cellos I was a bit confused at first and didn't think such a combination was possible until I listened to some of the songs. All I can say is that I was amazed!! WOW never have I heard anything so great!My favorites on this cd are Welcome Home (Sanitarium) and The Unforgiven because both of these fit the cello soooo perfectly!But I also have to recommend their other two cd's as well which I think are even better than this one, which is their first release. But it is still totally a great cd and I would recommend it to anyone who just plain enjoys music!"
2,it looks cool but how can i know,i like calassical. i play the cello and when i heard of this band i got really excited. When i tried to download the music it didn't work so i still have no idea what they sound like. Please make the music easier to acess so people don't have to download it
1,What is this crap???,"How in the world does this group of people make their money? If I could give this a measurement in negatives, I wouldnt hesitate a second to rate it as low as possible! Dont waste your money!!!!!!!!!"
4,Certainly not METALLICA......But not too shabby!,"If your looking for Metallica dont buy this CD. But If your a Metallica lover like me and you are open to different types of music other than rock/metal, then you might want to open up you ear drums and give it a whirl!! A little precussion wouldnt hurt!!"
4,Serious fun! Not a gimmick.,"Some albums that cover other genres with classical instruments end up being very gimmicky. Apocalyptica, however, obviously loves Metallica's music and does an excellent job of arranging it for a cello quartet without losing the original mood of the songs. This album sounds more acoustic than their subsequent, and equally-good, Inquisition Symphony, which gets more electronic and heavier.Occasionally, the voice part gets a little repetitive since there are no lyrics to provide variation between identical passages, but overall it's a very satisfying album. It should appeal to both metal lovers who are interested in a different take on Metallica and to classical lovers who like their music heavy. Cellists (like me) may find a new appreciation of the capabilities of their cello."
2,only a novelty really,"I was hoping for a little more, but the novelty of 4 cellos playing metallica wears off pretty quickly. Not my cup of tea."
2,not worth getting,"This was Apocalyptica's first album, and as such was made before they knew what the hell they were doing. The cellos don't blend or mix well together, and there is a distinct lack of bass-range sound, while the higher notes simply sound whiny. Much of this even sounds totally out of tune. Apocalyptica's music after this album was great, but the only thing good about this particular album is the (previous) quality of the material they butcher. This would only be worth buying (or stealing) if it was Apocalyptica's only album, which of course it isn't. This album is crap."
2,You get what you pay for.,I purchased this hoping to use it for an every day wallet. I should have known that the price was to good to be true. I do have to say the size and amount of compartments are great but the quality is poor. All in all I think Amazon has worn out its usefullness. Most of the prices here are inflated plus you have to pay shipping.
2,When will they learn?,"I find horror movies extremely annoying when the main characters don't appear to own a cell phone. In this day and age, that simply makes no sense. It's time to keep up with the times."
2,I kept waiting for something to happen then it was over.,"I purchased this movie on pay per view for 7 dollars.The previews looked great but the movie was just stupid.Loud thumps someone standing in the hall one second and gone the next,very cliche.The ending was not very suprising and really didnt explain the rest of the movie.The acting wasnt all that bad but not enough to make this movie good.If you want to see all the best parts just watch the preview for free."
3,Not a bad remake,Even though the spanish version was really good enough the american version is a little different but still holds up really well. Try the spanish version first cause it is much creepier. It is titled The Silent House (La Casa Muda)
3,Predictably scary movie,The movie was okay overall but the storyline was bland and predictable to me. There was a nice twist for an ending. I'm rating it compared to other scary movies rather than movies in general.It's probably suited for younger mature audiences (in my opinion.)
2,sorry I wasted my money,"The acting was awful, the plot was bad, my husband and I were sorry we rented this. We did not find it creepy or scary at all. When the main character was supposed to be acting terrified, it was phony looking. It sounded like an atmospheric spooky house movie, but we were very disappointed"
2,Disappointing,Unique Idea with the no film cut but the plot was horrible and didn't make sense. The movie was disappointing to say the least.
1,THIS HOUSE IS FAR FROM SILENT,"During its theatrical run, SILENT HOUSE was touted as 85 straight minutes of terror, suggesting the movie was shot in real time without edits. Research on IMDB clarifies that the movie was filmed in scene order but only in 10-minute segments and was edited. I mention this only because a real time filming would have strengthened the movie's originality.Alas, I don't think anything could have salvaged this disappointing movie.In a dimly lit house, we get Elizabeth Olsen running hysterically through the house from someone who has ostensibly attacked her daddy. Later her uncle returns to assist Olsen in finding her now missing dad. The movie's obvious ""twist"" is inevitable and elicits chuckles more than surprise.Writer/director Laura Lau has no sense of characterization and settles for uncontrolled performances."
1,Simply Dreadful,"Avoid this Faulkner work. It will not enhance your appreciation for his writing; rather, you are likely to regret ever having guiltily enjoyed Sanctuary. Other than his two Snopes novels, none of Faulkner's work after World War II is worth reading, and I include Intruder in the Dust in that assessment. Instead, go back to the works that demonstrated a gift for story-telling and language, rather than sales. Sanctuary is unique in that the lurid story of course was sellable yet Faulkner was able to infuse it with his own unique vision and style."
2,Sounds like the music on the Baby Einstein DVDs,"I like the song selection, but I didn't realize when I bought the CD that the songs were performed by the Baby Einstein orchestra. It's not soothing to me. I'll sell this CD at the next garage sale and buy one where the classical pieces are performed by traditional orchestras."
3,dissapointed,"The music is soothing, but its tempo is to fast. It isnt quite slow enough to fall asleep to. My son likes it for just around the house however."
5,Funny and insightful,"I read the book a year ago and found it very funny, and insightful. There are not many books that talk about technical things that are as funny and as useful as Philip and Alex's Guide to Web Publishing and the photographs are great too (you can see how they relate to the text, sometimes in very right brained ways, which is also a lot of fun).Yesterday I needed to add message boards to my web site and I ended up using Philip's lusenet service that he gives away for free and it works great.Buy it! Read it, and reread it when you're actually designing or redesigning your site."
4,Cuts through the baloney,"Greenspun cuts through the vendor hype and tells it like it is. His explanations of key concepts is crystal clear, concise and memorable."
2,"Not bad, but woefully outdated","Let's face it folks, this book was already outdated when it came out in 1999 and today it's even worse. The book *does* provide a good high-level discussion of how this stuff works (like you'd expect from an MIT prof), highly recommended for the utter novice. For everyone else, I'd pass until we see an updated version with less Microsoft bashing and even less demagoguery. But if you want a good history lesson, go for it!"
5,"Light enough for a manger, detailed enough for a s/w nerd",Don't spend any money on building a website service until you take a look at this book.Phil shares a heap of practical experience and entertains at the same time. Amazingly this book is an easy read and yet still detailed enough to get you started technically.
4,Years of web-experience boiled down to a bouillon cube,"Philip willingly gives away his expertise to those who evidence their own good taste by paying attention to him. His years of running photo.net make him more valuable than academics and UI researchers; his genial and witty personality make him far more accessible than hacker high priests who disdain end-users. The web comes into its own as a new medium, with unique value for bringing minds together, when backed by well-designed connections to databases. Even though the entire text is available on-line, you should buy this book. Like Aldus' first pocketbook editions of Virgil, this will placemark you as one of the savvy visionaries who knew where the web was going."
3,Decent movie.. Worth a look for a Mystery/Thriller.,Decent Indy film. There were some things to like but not a lot to dislike. The acting was good throughout most of the cast. The script was nothing special but the relationship between the 2 leads was odd so I guess that's what got my attention. I put the film on to watch while I was doing something else and it drew my attention to it away from what I was doing. I'm not sure why but not a lot of films do that. The soundtrack music was catchy too. Its an interesting watch. I would recommend it.
3,A Native American movie is a Cowboy horse race,"In kids games for the last century , it was : ""Do you want to be the Cowboy or the Indian?"" What appears to be an Canadian reservation of combined tribes, a young boy badly mishandled by the foster care system of the citycomes to the reservation to live with his grand father. These are plains Indians after the plains is gone out of them.The previous generations have had drinking problems and self-esteem issues.With the Indian gaming industry giving Native Americans a new way of living in many places, the idea that Native American can look out for each other as a family has surfaced.Here the community has brought two badly fostered children back to the reservationand they are ""TROUBLE"".It is a horse race to see who is the meanest?"
5,Spirit Rider,"Another successful purchase from Amazon, item arrived safely and promptly, I'm very happy with my purchase."
5,savory,"Each savory story is a tasty vignette filled with the flavors of East Texas, piney woods, country folk. None so long as to make you feelover-full. This collection is a thoroughly satisfying way to while away an afternoon."
2,Sizing is horrible!,"I bought this costume for my 3 year old. Given it's a 3-4T, I thought it might be a bit snug (she's big for her age), but I thought it would be ok for a few hours. It was awful! It fit my 1 year old (and even left an elastic imprint on her torso)! It was kinda cute, but looked a little cheap at the bottom - like the lace would fall off. Disappointed."
5,I like both of these movies,I like watching true stories and these movies were interesting. I thought that Lies My Mother Told Me was well acted. I enjoyed the other movie also.
2,Enter Nowhere,"This movie was pretty silly. The plot was ridiculous and the ""twist"" became obvious long before it should have. The setting, at least, was creepy, but that's about all this movie had going for it."
4,Thankyou Review,"My wife and I were looking for a movie last night, I read the reviews on Enter Nowhere they all said it was very good to Excellent I read them decided to watch the movie excellent movie the reason I am writing this is to thank the six that wrote their reviews about the movie and they did not give away the fantastic twist to the movie. Out of six people writing I thought with such a fine movie somebody would have slipped up. If anybody reads this it is one of the few movies right now well worth the 4-5 dollars watch it you will not be dissapointed. Thanks again, Larry Jones"
3,"This movie is just ""OK""","I probably would have given the movie 4 stars if it hadn't started out so slow at the beginning. After the storyline finally got going, I did get intrigued with the movie and thought it was interesting. I didn't see where it was heading with all the twists and turns, so I was surprised when the movie plot became apparent. It is worth watching, but I, personally, wouldn't watch it more than once. The reviewers are right... it is not a horror or scary at all! (I appreciate everyone who does write the reviews). Had I not read that it was not a scary movie, I probably would have never watched it."
3,Magic Book,"Item stated it was new but looked like it may have been used. Wasn't in bad condition, just didn't appear to be new as described."
1,Annoying hum!!!,I can't say if it works well or not since the high pitched hum that this unit generates is so annoying that I immediately removed and returned it. It is not loud just really annoying. Most people seem to not notice it which I find baffling. I am not a bat nor do I have super human hearing and I live in a NYC apartment which means it's plenty noisy already but I could still hear the hum which is almost painful it is so high pitched.
5,Gotta Love Those Recipes,I always wondered about those recipes in the Kay Scarpetta series but I don't have to wonder now. What a wonderful collection of recipes and a must for the Kay Scarpetta collecter!.
5,Scarpetta fans rejoice,This cookbook is great for the Kay Scarpetta fan or even your everyday Italian foodie. Beautiful pictures and amazing receipes.
3,Not for a Friday or Saturday night outing,"This is a remarkably well directed and produced hostage for ransom thriller set in England. Despite its minimalist cast, locations and obviously low budget, the acting was believable and the storyline engaging. The main characters played by Gemma Arterton (Prince of Persia, Clash of the Titans), Eddie Marsan (Sherlock Holmes), and Martin Compston (The Damned United) were true to form, but lacked a little likeability. Perhaps that's the main reason I'd consider this flick slightly above average and good for passing time, but not a movie I'd pick for a Friday or Saturday night outing.This movie gets high marks for offering a different flavor of cliche ransom movies, but excessive plot twists were a bit overdone."
1,me and rumi,it is very hard to read and understand..so i tried to return it but now i found out they send me the same book.
5,MUST BUY! BONUS SCENES & DELETED SCENES ARE HILARIOUS!,I love this show! I wish Tila would make another one. All of the deleted and bonus scenes you get is amazing!
4,"Terrific concert, but sound quality is average.","I like a great collection of songs where the speakers vibrate, and the furniture moves. Judy Garland could do it at Carnegie Hall. Tony Bennett, on the other hand, sings some songs with gusto, but that first CD just doesn't cut it for me. I had to turn up the stereo several times on the weaker tunes, and when he hit the torch songs, I had to turn the stereo down. Could someone at Columbia remaster this fine concert???"
3,Cracked!,"I love the mirror, but product arrived with a crack in one of outside mirror pieces. I was way to much work to repack and send back so I hung as is."
4,April Henry Scores Again,"Square in the Face is April Henry's second book which gives her readers another exciting and interesting look into the life of Claire Montrose. Claire is a former employee of the state of Oregon. Fortunately, for her, she has escaped the drudgery of state employment and now has time to enjoy life, her handsome boyfriend, and to help a friend, and former co-worker, who has a really big problem. Little does Claire know when she says that she will help, that she will find herself smack in the middle of a very dangerous undertaking. April Henry does a great job making Claire and her adventures real. And the really fun thing about April's book is how readily the reader can identify with Claire. If you're look for a fun read with some real life drama, this is the book for you. Sit back, relax, and prepare to have a really enjoyable visit with a very interesting and engaging young woman."
2,"Decorations, Candles and wreaths",I bought this book hoping it would focus more on candles. I was disappointed in that aspect - it discussed decorating candles and decorating with candles more than making candles. The other parts of the book - decorations and wreaths - are interesting and informative. They are set up for a variety of skill levels. It was an interesting book - and it gave me some ideas and projects.
5,US History with a beat,"My students love Epic Rap Battles on YouTube and this book showcases rappers that use historical events to rap about history. It contains annotations on the sides of the lyrics pages to help students with a general summary of important people, places, and events from the raps. It works really well with my high school students but I could imagine it working from middle school up. Great buy!"
4,my favorite stooge feature but i want Colorized,i own this one but i want the Colorized one.if they want to get by on the cheap put both verions.B/W and the Colorized in the case.this way people can watch the verion they like best.this way everyone is happy.be nice if it was cleaned up.all shows that have been Colorized should be released this way.i have seen a few that have... very nice!anyway this is one of there best movies.if your a stooge fan its a must have.
2,Not sure of I like it,"NOt sure if it does anything to my 4a/b hair. I dont hate it, but I have found no difference either way."
4,I like it,"I've been using this for about a month, I do like it a lot. Its much better for my hair than the conditioners I was using. I dont think its a super product but it is great and I will be buying it again"
3,Donnie Yen Shanghai Affairs.,"This is a good film of Donnie Yen, not great, it does have some nice fight scenes, and is worth it to add to your collection of his. Im a big fan of his,Ip man 1 & 2 are at his best, if you only want his best, I did like this one though."
3,relaible and cheap,its not the best mouse out there but its cheap and good if u just want a normal mouse. its a good idea to buy it if u want something simple.
3,Music that is repetitive that is slow,"A divermento is a type of music that by the sound of it seems kind of like background music. This is not something that grabs your attention like a concert work (concerto anyone? Symphony? Not here). Yet, like Mozart is wont to do, he does have some nice listens here and there. The adagio is particularly nice and beautiful. The string and horn work is like an expanded symphony that repeats itself to make up for it's length, but not in the symphonic way that grabs your attention. It is only something to buy if you you want something to wind down to that is'nt blissfully beautiful, and won't put you to sleep. The adagio might, but I tend to think it won't because it is introspective, think Mozart meets Barber's Adagio without the tragedy. The Andante for the winds might though."
5,Teaching Science and Having Fun!,"I absolutely LOVED this book when I was homeschooling! It provides a lot of information on how to teach what, and helped me find a balance when I would get freaked out about teaching science. It is a wonderful resource for homeschoolers."
5,Featuring an interview with each author,"Compiled and edited by Elzbieta Szoka, Fourteen Female Voices From Brazil is an impressive anthology of literature by female Brazilian authors featuring an interview with (and color photograph of) each author. Poetry, fiction, drama, and powerful literary voices and social messages fill the pages of this compelling anthology from cover to cover. Showcasing the lives and works of Nelida Pinon; Lygia Fagundes Telles; Helena Parente Cunha; Astrid Cabral; Marly de Oliveira; Jandira Martini; Leilah Assumpcao; Maria Adelaide Amaral; Myriam Campello; Sonia Coutinho; Esmeralda Ribeiro; Miriam Alves; Conceicao Evaristo; and Renata Pallottini, Fourteen Female Voices From Brazil is especially recommended for Women's Studies and 20th Century Brazilian Literature reading lists and reference collections."
2,what was that?,What was that? Really! Didn't think it was relatively new movie.....couldn't finish it. The girl is cute though. Should I have?
1,Big tittle for narrow scientific field covered,"I got fooled by the big title of this book, which is confusing, inaccurate at least. It should rather be called Modern optoelectronic devices. I would expect more textbook-style contents and treatment. Unfortunately, it's more about authors selected research and experience with few modern devices, mostly lasers, and corresponding basic theory.It treats in detail some special optoelectronic devices like lasers or modulators. No treatment of photodiodes at all, the only candidate for photodection is an amplified GaAs photodetector. I find it misleading regarding the title of this book!Stay away from this book of you are looking for a textbook or a reference text. If you are fan of state-of-the art research, it probably for you."
3,Get Your Groove Back -- my new affirmation!,"Sometimes I think I am loosing my mind. It is so hard to be a loving parent, yet feel like I am in, well, my ""groove,"" I suppose. What a reassuring connection to Vicki I feel because of this book. She could literally be me. (Well, not literally, I supppose really I mean figuratively.)"
1,Complete Waste of $,"This toy does absolutely nothing of value, other than to appear as a laptop. I wouldn't purchase this for any kid over 2."
2,The 4400 Season 4,You can tell this was the last season just btw they rushed it. Unfortunate because the first 3 season were excellent. Is a movie in the making to bring us some sort of closure?
4,vast improvement over season 3!!,"after a disappointing season 3, I didn't know what to expect when season 4 arrived. I'm happy to report that season 4 might just be the best season ever; (although season 2 is EXCELLENT as well).the stories in sea. 4 are a grade above season 3, and Billy Campbell's return to the series elevates the dramatic tension. Joel Gretsch and Jacqueline McKenzie also shine in the 4th season.hate it that the series has now ended; maybe the producers will create a big screen movie for fans in the future.."
5,Great show + fantastic season... Of course it's canceled,"I discovered this show during its 4th season, and was immediately hooked. I love the storyline, and the way they made the characters real and in-depth. I.e. I love the way not all those with powers do well...some suffer tragic ends.I was really really happy to have found this show, and was looking forward to s5 but I guess that will never happen.if you love character driven storylines, you should definitely consider this"
5,Original Bates method teacher,"I read quite a few books by William Bates or his followers (Quackenbush, Goodrich, Schneider..) and I successfully improved my vision myself (formerly a -4/-3,25 myope, I now play tennis, go to the cinema, work, ski... live, in short, without glasses) and I appreciated this short but dense book, with lots of new drills for the eyes and an interesting chapter on cinema and television, considering the long time one spend today on screens !NB : Margaret Corbett was the Bates teacher who cured Aldous Huxley's near-blindness . In dedication, the famous author wrote ""The Art of Seeing""."
5,Discover Unfettered Talent,"The writer of this book - and several others - is pure genius. She has captured the pathos of contemporary women. Infused with brilliant glimpses of a life of faith, Lisa Samson is a force to be reckoned with...watch this wondrous talent.I hope that you too will enjoy Tiger Lillie...and the many other characters Lisa introduces in the pages of this novel. Enjoy!"
3,Different ...,"I'm a huge Lisa Samson fan, but had never read this one. It's an unusual writing style, switching back and forth between characters and time periods in a way that is kind of hard to follow, and I was probably a third of the way through the book before I really caught on to the story. This was a book club selection, so I persevered, and ended up appreciating the unusual storyline, covering a topic of legalism in the church that isn't often discussed. It did lead to a great discussion for our bookclub, which is a big plus!"
2,Unreleased?,"This is an oddball collection. One for the die hard fans only. If you want live KISS, then pick up any of the three 'Alive' albums. Three of the previously unreleased tracks from '1975' sound like new recordings with old crowd noise dubbed in. The 1977 version of Take Me sounds more legit. I could be wrong. If you know anything at all about Kiss, then the bonus interview is redundant and pointless. Could've used that space for more music. Maybe some more tracks from the ""vault"" would've made this one a better package for fans and new recruits alike."
2,Disappointing,"I expected much more from this book. OK, Frank Koehler shoots two people and then flees to California (escapes isn't really the word--he just kind of walks off). Andy Roesenweig decides to catch him and after only several pages of looking for him, half way through this book, they find him. Well, so what? There's no real drama, no spectacular moment. The only part of the book that I felt was really intriuging was Frank's perspective on himself. Unfortunately, this was only a few pages long and while his own perspective is certainly a good start in exploring a criminal mind, I felt readers might benefit more from different views--perhaps from psychologists or criminal profilers or other relatives who knew him. I mean, if there's no action to speak of, why else would you read this? I felt the book didn't really go into ANY aspect of the case in any detail. Very disappointing!"
3,Inaccurate Adjectives,"The review of this book on its inside flap is what got me. The review said the book is ""intensely dramatic"" (it's not) and ""mesmerizing"" (it's not). The flap says the book ""carries us deep into the lives and minds"" of the bad guy and the good guy. It doesn't.This book actually reads like an abstract. As a result, I didn't find any the characters interesting, and I didn't feel particularly good or bad about any of them.The reason I give this book three stars rather than one or two is that 1) it included pictures, and 2) the pictures weren't all stuck in the middle of the book but were each placed in its appropriate spot in the text."
4,"A Cop, A Murderer and the Power of Restless Memory","Frankie Koehler killed two men; Andy Rosenzweig, a New York City cop and friend of one of the dead men, re-opens the case 27-years after the murders and the disappearance of Koehler--the cold case. Writing concisely, with truth and compassion, but straight-forwardly about the characters, Mr. Gourevitch, a staff writer for The New Yorker magazine, tells the story of a small-time 'wise-guy', the arrow-straight conscientious cop and how time may and may not soften the edges of good and bad people. I enjoyed the integrity and clarity Mr. Gourevitch strenuously employs to tell this sad, hopeful and redemptive story of justice ultimately achieved. All the characters, including the ethically misguided defense attorney, Murray Richman, are presented as real and human: the good, the bad and the ugly. For an honest study of human psychology, police procedure and some life in our times read 'A Cold Case.'"
4,Great Gadget!,"I've had mine now for 2 months and find it very useful to know both the climate conditions inside and outside. The forecaster is somewhat of a gimic for the most part, but since I dont use it I can't mark it down for this. The unit itself looks OK, displays well and is easy to use. The sliding door is flimsy and light but again, not a problem at all. The glow up function is handy also at night.I am very happy with this unit, and plan to buy more for family and friends. It makes a great gift."
3,Attractive but not super accurate,"I bought this to use as a hygrometer in a humidor. I had another Oregon Scientific model that I used and it worked well. I did a Boveda test to check the accuracy and found that it read relative humidity at -4% the true humidity. There is no method for adjusting the unit to read diferently, so I am forced to add 4% to the humidity when reading it. Not a huge deal, but for the price I would expect it either to be more accurate or to be adjustable. Besides that, the unit works well."
2,Not a perfect day in paradise,"I was an ambivalent reader of Shark Latitudes. The writing and imagery in her previous book were wonderful, but the allegories just a bit far fetched. Thus, I read Kiana Davenport's new book with the hope that she would use her considerable writing skills ""for good"". Unfortunately, I think she went the wrong direction. This book was unidirectionally depressing. While this is certainly acceptable (consider any novel about China or Ireland in the 1900's), where was the moral or redeeming outcome to make it worthwhile? I did not find it here."
2,From Back Cover,"He'd woken up weeks ago in a seedy hotel room - with no memory and a suitcase filled with cash. ""Luke"" knew nothing of his past, the money or the killers who wanted it back. But with the reflexes of a cat burglar, the instincts of a fugitive and the deadly shot of a gunslinger, Luke couldn't trust the cops. Hannah Dawson was his only hope.As a former cop, Hannah had devoted her life to putting away bad guys like the darkly sexy, mysterious stranger she was now attracted to - undeniably, inexplicably and helplessly. She was in danger herself, but was it from the killers on their trail... or from Luke?First in the 43 Light Street/Mine to Keep trilogy"
1,"Hard to use, results not accurate","This BPM is very hard to use. You have to have the cuff in the exact right place on your arm to get a reading. If not, you will get an error. Of course, you don't know you're going to get an error until you've sat there, perfectly still, for a few minutes, only to find out at the end that it didn't work - frustrating. I've gotten more errors than accurate readings, and I've quit using it all together. I've tried to place the cuff on my own arm, and my husband has also placed it for me, with great care and diligence. I'm 41, and not restricted health-wise in any manner - I can only imagine how frustrating it would be for someone elderly or health-impaired. I can't recommend it to anyone, based on my experiences."
1,horible,this product was used versus new so i returned it and costi me twelve dollars expense for nothing. So I have refrain myself ordering from amazon because is turning to be ebay. thanks
3,hard to use,This would be 5 stars if the cuff was easier to use. Try another Omron with a better cuff.
3,to much detail...,Guess I was looking for a less technical look at its growth. I would have enjoyed less chemical info and more camera development and the marketing in those days.
2,MOSTLY BORING!,"Maybe some historians will appreciate this very detailed (but incomplete) record of the history of photography. But for me, it was mostly boring."
4,Better than average look at the Troubles,"Above average film about one man's decision to get out of the IRA (easier said than done) by turning ""informant"" (hence the name of the movie). Other than Timothy Dalton's usual overacting, the performances all around are quite good - a very worthwhile movie with excellent music by The Pogues and Shane McGowan."
5,1975 release of Italian fusion music,"Perigeo's first US release on RCA records in 1975 introduced them to the fusion audience in spectacular fashion. A very diverse offering along the lines of other bands like ""Kittyhawk"" or ""PFM"" , also from Italy, Perigeo's( no vocals) blend of acoustic and electric music were ahead of their time. Leader Giovanni Tommaso's moog work and direction are in the vain of many '70's fusion bands. An American, Tony Sidney plays acoustic and electric guitar. I found the music to be challenging and entertaining while not overly heavy handed. As a disc jockey on free form radio in the '70's and '80's , I played this as a staple of fusion segments, It is well worth the price."
2,skips&skips,I typed in clean version& thought thats what I was getting & it turns out to be explicit version. It only has to 2 tracks & the second track skips as soon as it starts. Anyway I only paid $2._ _ ?
1,A strange anti-British rant,"I have always enjoyed Eric Flint's books and so happily bought '1812' believing it would offer some interesting variations on a poorly understood subject. Instead I found myself immersed in what, from this side of the Atlantic, appears to be an anti-British rant. Why Mr Fint feels the need to invent battles between the British and Americans so as to chalk up a few undeserved wins for his home team is beyond me. The more I read the book the worse I felt and in the end gave up in disgust; a first for me with one of his book. However, I shall not be buying any more of his books in this ilk. I'm just glad that his low opinion of us is not shared by the vast majority of his countrymen."
1,Don't waste your time.,"The Raschkes have nothing new to say, and they are saying it. A rehash of an old ""issue"" of interest only to the neo-theologians and pastors who are living on the church dole."
1,the title should have warned me,"Wayfarers of Fate is exactly what it sounds like;a soap opera put to print, a tele-novela without the ""tele."" For research the author relied upon a Spanish aristocrat's pro-Catholic, pro-Franco view of the events of the Spanish Civil War. I can't be sure of this but I don't think the democratically elected government of Spain was ever referred to as a ""Republic"" nor were the rebellious Franco forces referred to as ""Falangist"" or ""Fascist"", nor was there any mention of Mussolini's or Hitler's support of Franco. There was ample print devoted to the role of the Soviets and communism, indeed it was central to the storyline. Replete with warring brothers, evil communists, a sexy evil communist woman and ultimate redemption through prayer, this book belongs in the Vatican Library not in yours!"
3,Middle of the road pop vocals...,"Tony Bennett is a middle of the road pop vocalist, and the best there ever was, however this re-issue of Tony Bennett's Something is right smack dab in the middle of the road, and there are so many other great CD re-issues of Bennett material, that make this less essential. The highlights of this CD are ""On A Clear Day"" & ""Wave."" However if you want Tony Bennett the jazz singer try ""The Tony Bennett-Bill Evens Album,"" ""Tony Bennett/Bill Evans-Together Again,"" ""I Wanna Be Around,"" ""Who Can I Turn To?,"" ""If I Ruled The World: Songs For The Jet Set,"" ""Sings Rogers & Hart,"" ""Steppin' Out,"" and don't forget his latest and greatest ""Bennett Sings Ellington: Hot & Cool."" Try those titles first, then get this one. Bennett is truly a versitile artist, and ""Something"" was his most commercial LP aside from his greatest hits packeges which I highly reccomend you stay away from."
4,Very good - recommend,"The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the foam packaging was a messy and stuck to the unit. But over all, everything was easy and it looks great."
5,So you thought you knew the Founding Fathers.,"Gouverneur Morris may be the virtually unknown, underrated key to understanding the American Revolution, and this exciting new book tells his story from a fresh viewpoint. Thorough-going scholarship combines with bright and lively prose to bring Morris to life and set the record straight on his role in the establishment of the American Experiment. Dr. Miller shows that the conventional view of Morris has been much too limited and is due for thorough revision. This study is much more thorough than the recent popularizing biography of Morris by Richard Brookhiser. If you liked that book, which acknowledges Miller's ground-breaking research, you should read this one to learn the whole story. This book is invaluable for serious students of the Revolutionary period."
5,Who the hell is Lucia Solorzano? I wrote the book alone!,"In any case, I'm revising the book right now. And I would welcome any comments. Warren Boroson"
3,Newman at his best,"I just wish this was a full score with the opening track as the theme!All in all the recording sounds good but with way too much processing, Newman's music is too moving to be stifled with a sound engineers good intentions ;)"
5,Great cups!,"I was disappointed, however, not to get the cups shown. My daughte really likes Diego and Alicia, and I was hoping for these, but I received two cups with Diego surfing instead. Other than that though, these are wonderful cups. They don't leak, as some have complained; perhaps they didn't connect it right or had faulty parts? I'm not sure, but I've had no problems whatsoever with the cups. This is her second set and she just loves them!"
1,"Hate to admit it, but not good..","And I REALLY wish they were! I love EVERYTHING about them other than the fact that I have bought about 5 of these two packs, and it never fails that ONE of the two leaks. The little inserts come out so easily. I have a 2 year old and a 1 year old so I need something that can take a few hits here and there. They are just such a hit and miss. If it was ONE out of all five packages, I could understand...but 50% bad...not good."
5,A terrific book for a student of race in the social sciences,"_Race in Mind_ is a terrifically well informed and enthusiastically written book, clear and direct in its prose, that explains and debunks the concept of race from within the biological and social sciences. Anthropologist Alexander Alland provides an analysis of the science and history of the concept that will serve beginning students in the social sciences with a solid foundation, and more advanced students with a thoughtful and concise articulation of race and its perils. Alland connects the science, psuedoscience, and history of race to the social facts of racism and racist practices, from slave aution listings to what he terms the ""pluses and minuses of multiculturalism."" _Race in Mind_ is an excellent and important read."
5,Thought provoking and challenging,"Very well written and thought-provoking reading. What is our responsibility to those around us? Challenges us to reach out to those who are ""different"" from us, whether racially, economically, or any other way."
2,dark shadows,"This is a beautiful lakeside picture but unfortunately, it is so dark that it is difficult to see the variations of color. I would recommend that you place this puzzle out in the sunlight so you can see what you're doing."
1,"uh i wouldnt listen to this ""donald"" clown",This is a horrible repro made on someone's home pc.The movie I got was in some widescreen format that was converted from full screen so all picture was stretched (sort of like the jacket on the dvd case)!DONT BUY IT!!P.S. I think that this cheezy flicks company has taken their company name a little too literally. Ten bucks is also a bit much for a movie that appears like it was reformatted by a person who had gone right outta their tree.
1,It last only one month,"I bought this Kamik Rocket winter boots for my 6 year old son and he worn it just one month and it already had opened stitches and the opened holes along the Velcro lines. The water got inside when it rained. It was not good quality at all. Spent almost [...] when it was on sales but lasted only one month. It was said on the tags attached to the boots as ""MADE IN CANADA"" with high quality but it was not as what it said. I was so regretted to buy it and to prefer to my sister to buy it for her son."
1,JUST AS SWAN LAKE(BORING AND STUPID),I SAW THE WHOLE MOVIE.IT WAS STUPID AND SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BORING.I HOPE THE NEXT MOVIE(THE BARBIE DIARIES)WILL BE BETTER THEN THIS CREEPY MOVIE.BY THE WAY THE MUSIC STINKS.REEEEEEEALY STINKS.SARA SIBLINI!!!OKAY!!!I AM A MY SCENE LOVER AND A BRATZ LOVER*FOREVER*I AM NOT A BARBIE FAN LONGER RIGHT NOW.
2,Not a keeper,"The scenes are beautiful and the ice skating graceful. Other than that, it really isn't great for children. Rebellion, plural marriage and revenge do not comprise a children's movie in my opinion. My daughter runs out of the room and hides under my bed each time the villain appears. Needless to say, we will not be keeping it.It is our first Barbie movie, but it also doesn't always load in our brand new Philips DVD player. Wish I had rented it first."
2,blah,We have almost every Barbie movie. My daughter loves them. This one however was the worst!!!!!!!!! It was dark and just off.
5,This Movie Teaches a Lesson,"I have read many of the posted reviews about this movie and it seems as though people stop watching when she disobeys her parents. I definately agree that is not the correct way for a child to act, but after she does this, there are consequences. She has to go through a lot of things to fix the problem that she has created by not listening to her parents. I think it is a very good movie, (as they all have been so far) and I think it teaches a very valueable lesson."
2,"Didn't watch all of it, but not happy with what I've seen.","Just wondering... since when did Barbie start to look like Paris Hilton? The package doesn't show any resemblance, but as I was watching a preview of this DVD... I couldn't miss the obvious similarities. If my daughter was still young enough for the Barbie DVD series, I'm sure she would have wanted to watch this one... but I would be concerned that such a treasured icon for young ladies is now being modeled after someone who should not be considered a role model."
3,Looks nice............I hope that................Barbie in 3-D.,"Well......1.Not sure.....2.But looks nice......3.More for younger girls.......4.The picture is pretty+the movie is with 3-D........_________________________________________________________________Well......I like to say.....I have all Barbie movies and they are realy good.Specialy Rapunzel and the Princess and the Pauper.They are my favorites.I will give this one 3 starz,because I don`t know how it looks like.......I hope it`s not a bad movie........"
4,Another Barbie Favorite!,"We enjoy watching all of the Barbie movies, and this one was enjoyable as well. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is due to the shameless marketing in this movie. It was a bit too much ""buy this"" embedded in the movie. The others were not as blatant, in my opinion. As a result, we HAD to buy the Pegasus head and the dolls. Besides the marketing, the movie was fun to watch. After 50 repeats of it since Christmas, I am not tired of it ....yet!"
3,"The movie is decent, but why ...?","I liked this movie a fair bit as a creepy, frequently surreal ode to HP Lovecraft and a nice example of creative horror filmmaking on a shoestring budget. All that said ... this is a slightly better than average low-budget foreign horror film and not even remotely deserving of a two-disc set with a corny medalian or your $40. I found an earlier DVD release of the film in a bargain bin for $7 - that price more accurately reflects the value of a good-but-not-great horror flick on par with other decent obscurities like Zeder and Spider Labyrinth. Save your cash."
3,A good mix but not the best for wildlife other than birds,"The squirrels seem to like it okay, even though its missing a few of their favorite things: large dried corn kernals (these kernals have been minced) and large peanuts (again, chopped) so the winter birds seem to be enjoying the mix more than other wildlife. I probably won't buy it again since the squirrels in our yard seem to like bigger objects, but we have cardinals, bluebirds, mocking birds and woodpeckers who have all picked up the foods. There seems to be wasted food that none of the wildlife like, though, like most of the chopped corn."
1,An insult to intelligence,"Book is based on a lot of unsubstantiated claims. A couple of them:1-UN helped Saddm to stay in power but he says nothing about US policy during the 80's (under the author's nose)when US was supporting Saddam directly.2- UN hiring terrotists in Palestine to run their UN programs .UN helped Al-Qaeda.Again nothing mentioed about the policies of the administration that he was a part of it to bulid islamic militancy in Afghanistan against Russia. On FOX NEWS he claimed that the ambulance drivers in Occupied territories are terrorists disguised as drivers.The book is full of outrageous and unfounded calims all quoted from his ""own reliable "" sourses."
1,quick and easy read,"This is a quick and easy book to read since the author only presents the very few facts that support his opinions. If you waste your money on this book, at least you won't waste much time."
2,Wasn't impressed,"this was the first digital camera i purchased. i am an adventurous person and wanted something that would stand up to my lifestyle. this camera wasn't it.the good*it is compact, which is pretty convenient*it has several camera functions that have the potential to work well if you are techno-savvy.the bad*after snorkeling with it for 30 minutes, the camera leaked and broke. olympus replaced it, but only after my 2 month stay in costa rica was over.*the functions are unreliable and difficult to use. rarely if ever do i get them to work how i want. the pictures always need touched up afterwards, sometimes seriously.*the zoom sucks. don't expect to get those awesome close ups they advertise unless you have some serious patience.*the image stabilization is a joke. you need a tripod or surgeons hands to take pictures that aren't blurry.*the user manual left me with a lot of questions"
2,dissapointed..soon returned,At first the camera seemed like a great buy with lots of unique features. I soon learned that all the extra features did not make up for the extremely poor picture quality. There is color distortion as well as pixilation. Save your money.
2,I had the camera for one day and I'm returning it-,"The camera only holds a total of 13 pictures!!!! The pictures during the day were phenomenal but my night pictures were horrible. The picture was so delayed and blurry. Moving pictures, even with the 'sport' mode on were just as blurry. I am not a camera expert and this is my first camera but this is not what I had expected."
4,Great camera for it's durability,"This is an amazing camera. It takes clear, sharp, highly detailed images above the water and in the pool. I just stick this small camera into my shorts pocket an it goes everywhere with me without a care. I'm very happy with the still image quality ( I shoot on the highest quality). However, I'm not giving it a top rating because the movie mode is sub par. It's difficult to get to, you can't zoom while shooting, the image quality is low and choppy. The Kodak v550 I have does a perfect job of movies. It would also have been great if they had a bluetooth connection to transfer the images. However, for a carefree, durable camera, I still recommend it."
3,Not a serious camera.,"I have a Canon sd500 and a Canon XTi. I got this camera to use in the water.It is indeed waterproof, very compact, easy to use. The lens is internal and well-protected by a little metal shield when the camera is off.It goes up to ISO 1600 but the noise is obvious even at 800. I find the noise unacceptable even at ISO 400, in comparison with my Canon point and shoot, which only goes up to ISO 400 but has essentially no detectable noise at that level. It takes a long time to recycle between pictures. And the lack of a viewfinder means that on a sunny day I am just pointing the camera in the general direction of the subject and hoping for the best, as I can barely see what's on the LCD."
1,Olympus camera is bad to the core,"Product was received in new condition.Camera had focus problems from the start (understand that this camera was purchased to provide a point and shoot alternative to my standard Canon 1D Mark II system equipment).After numerous calls to customer service and about 6 months of use the camera finally refused to power on.Olympus customer service was contacted once again, I was thinking that they would simply exchange the camera.They told me sorry, buy something else.I will never ever purchase anything else that is manufactured by and/or sold by Olympus.Obviously quality control and customer service are not on their list of must do operations.PS The rating system requires that I enter a minimum rating of one star. Frankly I tried to enter a minimum rating of ""0"" stars, the product is crap."
5,Wow!,"""Sunk Witout a Sound"" is a real page turner, literate, suspenseful and gracefully written. It recalled my brief experience on a commercial raft several years ago. Why people choose to risk the mighty river's wrath remains a great mytery to this landlubber. After only 5 days in the cold depths of the black canyon, I couldn't wait to get out. What the hell was I thinking?Bessie Hyde's poignant little poems atop each chapter break my heart. I couldn't put this book down."
4,Glen&Bessie Hyde,"Just returned from 7 day trip down the Colorado River/Glen Canyon. One of the favorite stories was of these ""honeynooners"". the book is a wonderful adventure and worth a read, particularly if you have the joy of rafting that water. Enjoy!"
1,Beware of screaming noise,This product would be great if it didn't make a heinous squeal when it was being used. I figured i wouldn't read the reviews because it was a Bosch product and it was something simple like a hose and a few fittings. What could go wrong?? Even with ear plugs the noise makes me cringe. This item is garbage. DO NOT BUY!!!!
1,Too small for a shop vac - better for a tiny vac,"Keep in mind on this hose it is only 19mm - 25.4 mm would be 1 inch - 38mm would be roughly 1.5 inches, so this is HALF the diameter or 1/4 the cross sectional area of a typical shop vacuum hose which will drop airflow significantly - fine for drywall dust but if you get a piece of paper or a edge strip sucked into this hose you are likely to clog it. The fitting on the vac end is the standard 2"" (50mm) fitting, so your hose is going from 19mm to 50mm with a high probability of clogging with any large object (nail, drywall screw, paper, etc) which would fly easily through 1.5"" hose (38mm).Perhaps packaged with a small nozzle for computer keyboards or a dusting brush for computer fans and laptop fans it would be useful - as it is it's trouble - look at the Mr. Nozzle hoses - much better professional grade hardware."
5,aok,"shipped right away, good price, correct spark plugs. I have used iridium plugs in my yamana fjr1300 and they are worth the extra money."
3,sUSPENSE IN SLOW MOTION,"The book is filled with twists and turns as Dr. Lauren Chambers, a professional therapist, goes in search of her husband, Michael, who fails to return home from a skiing trip. That is just the first step into a world of mystery, suspense and the unknown. ""Hunted"" is filled with excitement and the unexpected but at a slower pace than anticipated. There were parts that seemed to drag on like a soap opera in an attempt to prolong the story. Overall, it was still a book worth reading, although it lacked the punch and pace of Jacobson's ""False Accusations."""
5,great read,An adventure love story taking place in Western Australia with a back drop of the pearling industry beginning in the early 19th century.The author puts you in the minds and hearts of the characters and paints them well from the first page. It is an absorbing historical novel well told having information about the Aborigines that is little known.I could not put it down.Donna Kidman.
5,Movie #13 finally on DVD...!!!,"This is by far one of the best DBZ movies, but unfortunately it is also the final.If your a DragonBall fan I highly recommend this movie.Watching Son Gohan battling the lower half of Hirudegarn in the middle of the city is just amazing,And not to mention this is also where you get to see Son Goku use his Ryu-Gen (Exploding Dragon Fist) for the first time.Definately 5 Stars"
4,plot &review.,"a warlock name hoy carries a music box which holds a warrior names tapion and a second half of a monster called hidugarn with help from goku and the others they collect the dragon balls to open the box, but what dangerouse mysterius lie within this box.i like this movie alot but picclo isin't in it and vegeta's part is real small (there two of my most faveirate charectors on the show but the rest was good, hidugarn was neat it's pretty cool when the bad guy is a giant-godzilla sized monster tons of building destruction."
3,and the last 1,"this is the last dbz movie i have it, but it's not the best. It mostly focus on Trunks beinag an only child, so thats boring. But there are good fights in it"
2,Disappointing,"This book records a series of voyages by Frank Dye in a 16' Wayfarer dinghy, over the course of six summers, starting in Florida, continuing up the east coast of the US, and into Canada, ending finally in the western Great Lakes. Given the vast distances & challenging sailing conditions, and the author's wonderful previous outing, ""Ocean Crossing Wayfarer,"" I expected a gripping read. No such luck. Dye's wife Margaret started out as crew, but bailed on the voyage about 900 miles in. I bailed at the Bay of Fundy and didn't finish the book. She was tired and cold and sick. I was just bored. Margaret Dye edited ""Ocean Crossing Wayfarer"". This one was Frank Dye's alone. He may be the sailor of the family, but she is plainly the writer. I have no doubt that Dye experienced some remarkable things on the voyages described. Unfortunately we aren't privy to them. Its title notwithstanding, ""Sailing to the Edge of Fear"" reads little better than a log book."
5,Loved this book since I was a kid!,I still have my copy of this book that I received in the early 80's. To my delight I recently learned that my young nephew is also a left-hander and I wasted no time ordering him a copy of his own. Very interesting and still relevant today!
2,Juvenile,"The cartoon, coloring book format is too juvenile. I was looking for something more appealing to adults. Some sexual content was also inappropriate. I've already returned the books."
2,NOT FOR THE TRUE BEGINNER,"First, the type-o's were annoying and made some things hard to understand because I wasn't sure if it was a type-o or the ""lingo"" which she assumes we all know. My contents page is upside down. I found the pictures juvenile and not helpfull at all. There is not enough detailed information for this to be a learning tool for the beginner. The basics of serging are not covered well. This was not at all what I was looking for as an instructional aid. I may make some of her projects after I learn the basics from another source."
4,Best Bio out there,"This is, to my knowledge, the best bio that can be read on the most important man in Dutch History in the English Language. It goes over his entire life, from when he was born, to his assassination. Although I feel that Wedgwood may not give some of the negative details of this Great Man, she is generally unbiased. Recommended to anyone interested in Dutch History."
1,"Now, by some miracle, the cover art matches the actual film, however...","this offering is a DVD-R, so buy at your own risk. It's really amazing, how when I posted the first review, the cover art & product description was to do with the jet set & an entirely different movie by the same name with an entirely different plot & cast. Now, suddenly a month later, the image displayed previously has been replaced with the correct cover art for Death Game/The Seducers & the product description now matches the film! I'd say this was downright bizarre, but all the same, another official release of Death Game is coming out beside the one currently released by VCI. I've seen a trailer for it on YouTube & it looks quite decent. Now, if only we were given a release date & it was listed for preorder."
5,get ready for the old course,"if you want to get the real feel, this is the book.. old and new.great course descriptions of all holes and how to play them which i will do on apr 4th. all the trivia and little known facts. amaze your friends astound your buddies. this is all you need."
1,Costs twice as much as my first car. Get OpenOffice.org.,"My first car in 1990 cost $$$ and was worth every penny. Microsoft Office, XP or other, not so much. It's good, but not compared to its price, and therefore not a good choice. If you haven't tried StarOffice or OpenOffice.org yet, or haven't tried the latest release, just do it. Unless you're a turbo macro user, or create feature-length animations in PowerPoint, you're spending a month's rent for nothing by buying MS Office.Plus, as other reviewers have mentioned, with this version you have to register and activate it before it expires. No more MS Office sharing.So anyway, be forewarned about the registration issue, and think about whether it's really worth twice as much as a rusty but dependable Datsun."
1,"Explodes for no adequately explored reason, very overpriced.","Not only do we continue to buy this overpriced software, but it continues to explode for no adequately explored reason, as well.As long as there was no actual choice, if one had to create Word files, then at least it made sense to use MS Office.However, now there is no reason to continue with the money flushing. StarOffice is a great deal cheaper, works generally the same way, reads and creates Word Excel and PowerPoint files, and is all in all an entirely adequate product.And yes, StarOffice runs on Windows too."
5,Converts to standard SD card as well,I ordered the card for my phone and was pleasantly surprised when it arrived quicker than expected and had an adapter to convert it to a regular SD card. This means I can use the same card in my regular digital camera. In fact this would be a really cheap way to buy a 2GB standard SD card.
1,Awful.,Don't waste your time. Case briefs suck. STructure is horrible. There isn't any way to print easily. buy CT Administrative Law instead.
3,Blood pressure monitor,This blood pressure monitor is just ok. Sometimes I am not sure if I am getting a accurate reading from it. But for the price it is not that bad.
4,Review of Omron HEM-780 Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with ComFit Cuff,The blood pressure cuff can be seen in more detail at http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009XQUES/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title. It is easy to use and stores histories for two people. Others can use it in 'guest' mode. I have not yet taken it with me on a visit to my doctor to compare the readings with the one my doctor uses. Just be sure to read the instructions to make sure you orient it correctly. I recommend it.
4,Very Good monitor,I really like this monitor. The only trouble I had at first was I kept getting an error message upon inflation. But now I have learned to use it correctly. It does seem to be very accurate.
1,Does not hold up and the results are inconsistant.,"I have been having problems with the unit flashing error all along but now it is ""hovering"" which means that it flutters back and forth between 2 numbers and your arm slowly turns blue. I went through a test with the CS agent and she says that it is faulty. I need to send it back and get it repaired. As with other people they said the cuff only lasts about a year- 18 months, I have not had it 10 months. They seem to expect to repair them and I am questioning the results that I have been getting, the doctor is always lower. I will pay the shipping to have this repaired, will never buy another one and will look for a manual one."
5,Taking blood pressure made easy!,"I am totally pleased with my Omron HEM-780 Blood Pressure Monitor.It is so quick and easy to use with the ComFit Cuff. The automaticmonitor does all the work and displays the large, easy to readnumbers in less than a minute."
2,Not Reliable or Accurrate,"I bought this model based on the great reviews it has received, but my experience has been completely different. The form factor and usability are fine, but the unit regularly ""under-inflates"" the cuff and thus fails to give a reading. Even when it does give a reading, the systolic is consistently 10+ mmHg LOWER than readings taken with equipment at local pharmacies or at my doc's office. I'm wondering if my arm is perhaps a bit on the skinny side for the cuff included with the unit.Since the inaccurracies are at least consistent, it is usable for tracking whether your BP is changing, but for getting real numbers that you can trust this unit doesn't meet my needs at all."
4,Good Device,"This is my 3rd BP monitoring unit. It is very easy to use and you can configure it to take a few measurements in succession and provide the average reading. So far, I'm happy with it."
1,OMRON REVIEW,"Hi,This Omron BP monitor is showing incorrect results. When compared with Mercury BP monitor there is difference of around 30. This means this instrument is showing reading 30 more than mercury monitor.I am disappointed with this BP monitor as this is not going to serve the purpose for which I bought.Unfortunately I have travelled out of United States otherwise I could have returned this instrument instantly.RegardsDeepak"
4,BP MONITOR WITH COMFIT CUFF,"In general, I like the product. I believe it is fairly accurate and its storage features for two people plus a guest (no storage) are useful. However, I find the ComFit cuff some awkward to use. Because it is difficult to tighten the cuff, I sometimes get an error message."
1,"Accurate, but...",Not impressed. It is accurate enough but the air hose is far too short and the cuff is very difficult to get on tight enough so that it does not error out. I do not recommend this unit to somebody trying to take their own BP.
1,Inaccurate,"It's got so many good things going for it that I was disappointed when we checked it against my doctor's reading in his office. It read 10 to 15 points high. So I ordered a replacement. Unfortunately, same thing."
3,ok to use but doesn't match doctor,"Unit was prescribed by doctor. I used this unit for several months, every morning and evening. Easy to use. Took it with me to the doctors office. Reading was consistently low by 10-15 on both sys and diastolic. While 3 measurement average had less variability, reading was still biased low. Didn't seem to be any calibration procedure."
1,This cuff did not work for me.,"Unfortunately, this monitor was 30 to 40 points higher than my blood pressure reading at drugstores and my doctor's office. Also, the pressure on my arm was so tight that it left welts even though the size of my upper arm was well within the size range."
1,Disappointed and Frustrated with unit and supplier,I ordered this BP monitor knowing Omron was a good company. The cuff that came with it does not fit properly on your arm and is very difficult to put on by yourself. I contacted OnlineSupplier for help and they recommended that I buy a different cuff and told me which one to buy. So I bought the cuff recommended by OnlineSupplier and it does not go with the 780 BP unit at all. Online Supplier refuses to respond to my complaints. So I am stuck with a unit I can not use and a new cuff I can not use. I had to resort to buying a completely different unit from a different supplier since I can not trust Online Supplier to correct any problems.
1,Way off,"Initially, this unit was accurate. After gentle use three times a week, for several months, it has become wildly inaccurate, showing systolic readings approximately 30-35 points higher than actual, and diastolic 10-15 points higher than actual."
5,Good Product and easy to use,"Great product, and so easy to use, even my mom can use that one by her self"
4,Neat,"You can buy this product eyes closed. It is just a good product, doing perfectly its job. Solid and reliable."
3,"Okay, but not for me","Although this is a very sophisticated product, because of my veins, I was not able to get proper readings; hence, my doctor advised that I not keep it. It will probably work well for most other people."
2,Hem 780 BPM,"Product does not work well, drops out intermittently while taking readings and you have to try several times to make sure you have a normal or close to normal reading. Will probable return it."
4,Nice for the price,"We bought this device so we could monitor my husband's newly-diagnosed hypertension. He didn't really care what kind of machine we got, as long as it was accurate. He takes his BP twice a day and has it set to take 3 readings, then it averages the 3. He likes the machine, and it seems to be fairly accurate. He has not yet been back to the doctor for his follow-up visit, since starting his medication and monitoring his BP daily. But, I feel certain we will find that his readings coincide with his physician's. As for my opinion, I am a large lady, and the cuff seems too tight for my arm. I don't know my arm measurement, but I do know that the cuff inflates VERY tight, and many times I will get an ""E"" (error) reading. Since this does not happen with my husband, I have to assume it's because of the size of my arm versus the size of the cuff."
2,Not accurate -- sleeve way too big for even my arm.,Ton's of bells and whistles but the comfit sleeveis anything but comfortable -- it lacks velcro -- you cannot get an accurate reading unless you have huge arms and are extremely fat in the forearm -- this is a BAD design for a sophisticated machine... plus because the sleeve is so messed up there's no way of knowing if the reading's you are getting are accurate -- BAD BAD sleeve design!
3,Cuff was difficult for me to get properly tightened on my arm.,"I found that the ComFitcuff on the Omron HEM-780 was very difficult to adjust properly. I called Omron and was told that it should fit quite snugly. My upper left arm is 11 inches, which is a normal size, but I just couldn't get it to fit properly. Also, I took it to my cardiologist and found that my readings were 20 points different than his. Perhaps it was because the cuff wasn't fitting properly. I do have arthritis in my hands and perhaps didn't have the strength to attach the cuff correctly. I returned this model and instead bought the soft cuff Omron HEM711 from Amazon., which is so much easier to use. It doesn't have the morning and evening storage, but I find it much easier to operate properly. I appreciate the fact that Amazon allowed me to return the HEM-780. Also, the Omron customer service is excellent. They are patient and give good advice for using your monitor."
4,Good unit. Easy to use,"Have only used the monitor for a few weeks but I found it is very accurate and very sensitive. I did have a couple readings that showed I moved but that wasn't the case. I redid the reading and it was fine. I would recommend this monitor especially for easy of use, ease of reading the display and what I'm sure is accuracy. I also appreciate the memory feature and the dual person readout as well as the ""guest"" mode that doesn't record the reading in the A or B profile."
5,blood pressure monitor,This is a great blood pressure monitor. The cuff is very comfortable and the unit is extremely accurate. I had it checked at the doctors office and the nurse said that it was closer to theirs than any other she had checked. It is very easy to use also.
4,Good Machine,"Very good quality and easy to use. The only reason I don't give it five stars is because of the difference in readings from the doctor's office. My blood pressure on this machine is considerably lower. There may be many reasons for the discrepancy: white coat anxiety, more relaxed at home, less stress, etc., or the machine just gives a different reading."
3,It wasn't what they said it was...,"The details said it came with computer software the would allow you to keep a computer record of your blood pressure... it did not!However it does work well and sync's up with my doctors on the button.I did complain about ""no software"", however I haven't heard back from Amazon.com about it.That is all."
5,Easy to Use - A Must For Monitoring Your Blood Pressure,"I bought this product for my dad - his heart and kidney doctors both recommended this model - and I am so glad I did.He had been using a wrist blood pressure monitor, but it was always giving widely fluctating readings and you never knew how accurate it was. This Omron is simple to use, has a large easy-to-read screen and takes more consistent measurements than other's he has tried.I would highly recommend this product for anyone who needs to monitor their blood pressure on an on-going basis."
4,Good one for the price,Good product for the price. Easy to use. I got the HEM-780N3 which is the latest version although the packaging show HEM-780 but if you look at the actual unit backside you will find it is HEM-780N3.Readings does not perfectly match with my doctors reading they were +- 10-5. Overall this is good to know your BP range and to track it.
3,Fairly accurate thusfar,"I've been checking this against the cuff at my clinic, and it's been running about 10-20 points high. I'm just going to adjust for that, considering the reasonable price. After a recent illness, I'm down to 95 pounds, and at the tightest cuff clinch, it still slides down my arm, though there is plenty room available to those of you with large upper arms, there is none for tiny folks."
1,Inconsistent,"Monitor appeared to be reading high. We took the machine to a highly qualified doctor, who originally recommended the Omron. He compared the Omron readings to his own blood pressure monitor. Sure enough, Omron readings were about 20% high, for both my wife and me. The whole purpose of a home blood pressure monitor is to determine if blood pressure is unusually high. We have little to no confidence in the Omron HEM-780. It is a disappointment."
1,Consistently Low Readings,"My original purchase failed within 30 days and Amazon sent out a replacment at no charge. Unfortunatly the replacement failed 45 days later, which meant I am stuck with a defective product. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!"
1,omron hem-780n3,"3/2009 i received this highly rated auto blood pressure machine. i work at a hosp, for 24yrs on nursing staff. I start by knowing my baseline pressure (manual) done by my RN friends and my doc. I workout and in good health! this machine was 10 to 15 over Dia and 7 to 10 over sys.I called Omron to get a verbal(blaming) walk through on what I did wrong and them resetting the machine. SAME problems. I was told to call the seller or send back but I had to pay for s/h. I was so disappointed by Omron. However i was Very pleased with the Seller ZENCORP007 for refunding my money and allowing me to pleasure to throw this poorly made item in the TRASH!! i have a old sunbeam auto bp machine cost me $30.00 4yrs ago will stay with the cheap machines work better.....Omron are morons."
5,supplies useful information,I have had wildly fluctuating blood pressure for years. It goes way up seemlingly for no reason then it comes back down (thank goodness). I am on daily blood pressure medicine. So I wanted to know the range of these fluctuations and see how well the medicine works. I am 84 years old but not dead yet. I like to get several readouts with one sitting. It's also easy and fun to use.
1,HHS did a Bait-and-Switch,"I was to get a bood pressure monitor MARHEM780 with a blue and white face plate (and a smaller and lighter design). Instead I got HEM-780 which appears to be an older product and one which could be purchased from a number of suppliers at $30.00 less. As I travel a lot, I could not complete the full cycle of returning the monitor. When I complained to Home Health Stores, I received an argument, even though I had scanned both the picture of what I had received vs what I was sold by Amazon.The older model weighs slightly more, and seems to work OK, except for low blood pressure readings (120/90 or less). As I am out of the USA for an extended period, I will be forced to use what I have, as I am to report to my Doctor on the results of the readings.I feel cheated by the supplier, not the OMRON manufacturer, hence the bad product review."
4,I am learning,"This is the fourth BP monitor I have bought. That is because I don't trust their readings. When I took this to my doctor to compare with his, the first comparison was 30mm higher than the drs. automated meter. The nurse then checked with a mercury/audible reading that confirmed the first drs. reading. However, the second drs. automated reading was also 30mm higher than the first. Can't seem to trust either automated meter. But, this meter has an automatic multiple reading with automatic averaging that seems to be satisfactory."
5,Omron HEM-780 Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with ComFit Cuff,Keeps an accurate record. Very easy to set up. Compact case makes it easy to travel with.
2,It was too hard to use!,I was very enthusuastic about this product because of all the bells and whistles that came with it but I ended up having to return it because it was just too difficult for me to use it. I just could not get the cuff on properly for some reason and it would not function until it thought the cuff was on right... therefore I could not use it. It errored too easily. I ended up returning it and buying an Omron HEM-670IT Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor with APS instead and I am very happy with that one.
1,terribly inacurrate--when it works,"For the price, I thought I would be getting a decent piece of equipment, but I'm not sure I've EVER gotten a correct reading from this machine. It's awkward for one person to use, and back-to-back readings, are WIDELY different. After just a few times use, I had to change the batteries. For a long time it wouldn't pump up, now it will pump up, but never gives a reading. The whole system looks ""brand new"", but it's going into the garbage. Customer service is awful. You'd think they would want to make things right to keep a customer, but you'd be wrong. Very disappointed. I will NEVER buy an Omron, of any kind, again."
3,Inconsistent measurements,This device seems to work well at times. But it gives me inconsistent results. I took it to my doctor to have a comparison made and it seemedpretty close to her calibration but I get very strage readings. I don't think I am dying. I have had a stress test recently and everything checks out. But I am not sure I trust the results I am getting from this device.
5,VERY PLEASED,This blood pressure monitor is of very high quality..It keeps very accurate readings..Another brand we had scared us to death because it was always giving a different reading every time we took it.. This one is a breath of fresh air.. Would recommend it to anyone.
1,sent it back,this machine was all over the board with bp readings. I took it to the doctor with me and it was way off. i sent it back.
1,It Got Me To The Emergency Room,"I bought this months ago. It has never read correctly being wildly high. I tested it in a doctor's office too and it was wildly high. For example, 170/110 instead of 140/88. That qualifies this as junk. Before I realized it was junk, I had such a high reading that it got me sick. I ended up in the emergency room."
5,Omren Blood Pressure Monitor,Great product. Amazon had the best price--about half of what it would have cost me retail from a store in the area I live in.
2,ENW @nd Omron,"This is the 2nd Omron monitor that I've owned. This cuff is very stiff and as I have a very small upper arm, I don't know what to do with the end of the cuff that has a small piece of velcro attached. Therefore, I have to leave that part detached--don't know if this affects the readings. The less complicated Omron did not have this problem, but eventually the velcro fasteners wore out. Thus, the replacement."
2,Cuff Didn't Fit Properly,"Although this monitor seems to have gotten good ratings from other users overall, the ComFit cuff was very rigid and did not fit my arm at all and kept slipping down to my elbow. This of course lead to error readings consistently. If your arms are bigger on top this cuff probably will not work for you. I instead went with another brand monitor that has a ""Soft Cuff"". Please do your research to determine if a ""rigid"" or ""soft"" cuff with work best for you. I will be returning this monitor because of the rigid cuff."
2,Did not receive item,I did not receive this item. I am trying to get the purchase credited back to my account. Not sure of the process.
4,Monitor WIth Ease,"This is very easy to use and quite convenient. I'm not sure, however, how accurate this monitor is. It seems to record a higher reading than a manual one at times. The value of this home monitor is if the readings change dramatically. THen it's a warning to go to the doctor's."
5,"Simple, accurate","Bought it for my parents, user A for dad, user B for mom and still able to do ""guest"" measurement readings without interfering with the memory."
5,Doc approves!,I brought this in to my Doctor to see if it was a good one and she said it's excellent. I've had NO problems thus far.
5,perfect price and perfect item,"Omron Blood Pressure Monitor is famours allover the world for dozens of years.I found this hem780 recently at amzon.com with the perfect price.I knew, the quality of omron was nothing to worry about.What I shuld do was just waiting for the perpect price.I grasped several chances,I bought some for my parents,relatives at China."
3,Somewhat unreliable,"This machine is easy to use, and quick to deliver results. However, I would use it only for a ""ballpark"" figure. I took it with me to the doctor's office and it did not register the same reading as the doctor achieved."
3,Just OK,Omron HEM-780 as a top model should have better material quality. The Cuff material is quite thin and does not give a impression it would last long time. Otherwise just ok.
1,My results,"My wife is a nurse, but couldn't find the time to check my BP as often as my Doctor wanted. I took my BP twice on both arms in the morning and evening. That was 8 times a day. I left the cuff in the same position for each second reading. Plus my wife brought a cuff to fit me. I tried to check calibration with the Doctor and my wife. They were both very close. Then checking with the automatic BP machine, It would not even come close!Even when checking on the same arm without changing anything, the readins were so different. i.e. 175/115. Repeat without moving: 95/75. One time it read 85/75. I should be dead. Normally I have 130/70. And this is what the Doctor and my wife usually get. At least within 5 points.Sorry, but I'll have to give this device a big old goose egg, It is not worth it!"
4,"Easy, sport. I got myself outta Beirut once, I think I can get outta New Jersey","The reviewers can say what they like, because I love this film. Its one of the few films where a woman is the one that saves the day and isn't flopping around like an idiot. Also, Geena Davis and Samuel L Jackson have real chemistry."
4,"Geena, you go.....",I'm a good appreciator of Geena Davis movies and making her into a government assassin was a great idea. Her look was perfect for making the context hard to believe. I liked it .......
3,Wow Humm Baby! Jerry Mouse! Cute!,"Genna Davis gives a good performance as a woman trying to remember her past as a secret agent. Unlike her previous Oscar winning gem in The Accidental Tourist, she does a 180 degree turn in this role as a character smooth as silk & cold as ice. Samuel L. Jackson is once again one of the most diverse actors in Hollywood with this supporting role. Overall, this is a surprisingly good action drama with lots of suspense. It works!"
4,IT'S HARD TO BE A MAN,"Energy is the word. This movie is full of energy. An action movie Howard Hawks could have directed 50 years ago. With strong characters and non-stop action.Considering the fact that Renny Harlin, the director of THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT, was Geena Davis's husband when the movie was shot, the personage played by the actress gets another dimension.We haven't seen so often nowadays a leading feminine role which is so slapped, tortured and beaten as it's the case in THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT. It seems that the face of Geena Davis has to be destroyed in order to be converted in another one.And finally she becomes, after all these rites of passage, CHARLIE.A man or a woman ? I let you choose the answer.A DVD for Geena Dav(l)i(p)s."
5,One of the Better Action Movies of the Mid-90s,"Quite frankly, I'm surprised that more people don't know about this movie. The plot has been worked to death in many regards, but this movie offers much more than other books and movies of its type (""The Bourne Identity"" by Robert Ludlum and ""Code to Zero"" by Ken Follet are both ""spies with amnesia"" stories.)What makes this movie so different? It's that the Samantha Kane character is cold-blooded, ruthless, and has no regard for human life. In short, she's much more effective in what she does than Ludlum's or Follet's characters.The movie is filled with suspense and plot twists, but its strongest points are the action scenes. Many movies of this type get bogged down in explosion after explosion (like ""Lethal Weapon 4""), but ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" manages to keep its momentum throughout the entire movie. I've never met a person who didn't like this movie--the problem is getting people to realize that it exists in the first place."
1,A RIDCULOUS SPECTACLE OF FREE VIOLENCE,"THis movie is a shame. I'm sorry that Jackson is in it, because he's a great actor, even when make brainless and entertaining movies as ""Deep Blue Sea"". But in this one, everything is cliche. THe action is over-steotyphed, Davis doesn't convince anytime as a ""hard"" woman, the dialogues are outrageous, ludicrous. It's a lousy film from beginning to end."
4,Insightful,I bought this book for my monthly book club and was very impressed by the research and stories that were chosen for the book. The author is adopted and had some great insights into the era when women were expected to give up their illegitimate babies. I would highly recommend this book as it really gives you an idea of how much or how little (depending on your point of view) things have changed over the years.
4,Been there; done that.,"I can so relate to the women in this book, ""having been there; done that"". My daughter who found me is next to read it, then my daughter-in-law. They both understand and believe what I've told them, but to read how so many others went through the same things, feelings, thoughts, and experiences will make it that much more real to them. I can't wait till they've read it and we can all discuss it. An absolute must for anyone who gave up a baby for adoption, was adopted during that time, had a friend or relative as a birth mother or adoptee, and for anyone who ever had any interest or questions about those involved in that situation. Only wish that there were more interviews and especially some from the children who had been given up."
5,The perfect combination,"This is the perfect combination: a prodigious piano, a wit conductor and an orchestra that is always so good, so wise. This performance moves me. I repeat its hearing so often.A good recommendation for you all!Greetings"
4,"VINCENZO NATALI, OPUS 3","***1/2 2003. Co-written and directed by Vincenzo Natali. Two antisocial long-time friends live in a house between highways in Toronto. They wake up one day in a strange world where nothing exists except their house. They understand soon that they're able to make disappear anything if they want it too. AfterCubeandCypher, another good movie of this talented director but does only one really good idea, even if it's handled to its most extreme implications, enough to make a great movie ? Nonetheless, I recommend NOTHING for its originality."
3,Scarriest book ever??? NOT!!!!!,"Although I did enjoy the book, I was in no way frightened like some of the other reviews have suggested. The whole book builds you up into thinking the ""Evil"" of the house will be revealed but the answer and ending are really unfulfilling. I was waiting for the house to ""come alive"" but it never did. I hate to say this but I hope the movie scares me more than the book did."
4,Not bad,"I give it a B. The one thing that it definitely is not, is scary. The title, picture, premise, are all misleading in that regard. It has less than a handful of ""creepy"" events throughout the entire story. It really is just about a woman. I'll leave it at that. The first chapter is sure to annoy with the protagonist's constant ramblings; the story picks up significantly in subsequent chapters. I think the story flowed well and I didn't find myself getting bored (but no nail-biting, page-turner either). Some of Jackson's writing was flawless, and overall I enjoyed her style. Really, if you're looking for a haunted house story, this isn't it; but I enjoyed the read nonetheless."
1,Annoying characters,"I loved Jackson's ""We Have Always Lived in the Castle"" but I couldn't get past the first few chapters of this book. I found the characters to be incredibly annoying.I find that the best way to make reviews helpful is by adding a list of books I love and books I hated. That way you can compare and determine whether you and I have similar tastes. So here is my list:Books I love or at at least really, really like:We Need to Talk about Kevin.Tell the Wolves I'm HomeWhen the Emperor Was DivineThe History of HistoryThe Remains of the DayWe Have Always Lived in the CastleThe Night CircusWater for ElephantsThe Sisters BrothersThe Poisonwood BibleBooks I REALLY hated:The Bear in a Muddy Tutu1Q84The Buddha of SuburbiaA Visit from the Goon SquadSun StormA Long Way DownWhen We Were OrphansThe Haunting of Hill House"
3,Not what I was expecting...,"For as long as I can remember, ""The Haunting of Hill House"" has been regarded as one of the greatest horror novels ever written. I do not agree. It is well written and the premise is perfect, but Jackson fails to deliver the punch that the novel promises. The ending was terrible. The whole reason behind the haunting is never explained, although we are left to assume that the good doctor knew all along. I also purchased the film version, and it, too was a let down. Maybe this novel blazed a trail when it was first published. I know that it has been copied in some form or fashion ever since. Many writers and directors praise this novel and film, and credit one or the other with shaping his or her career, but I didn't see what the fuss was all about."
4,Looking forwward to reading this book.,"I have never read this book but have seen the movie 3 times when groing up in the 60's. The movie was not one of gore, decapitations, or the actual seeing of apparitions, but what you allow your mind to see and experience. At 14 or 15 years old, I was still scared when seeing this movie (The Haunting taken from The Haunting of Hill House)."
4,It was ok,"A quick read, not really FANTASTIC, as some people said. It was definetely different from the movie (the 1999 one), and like the movie, the book didn't scare me one bit. It was interesting but not scary. It's real easy to fall asleep after reading this."
2,4 people go to a haunted house to spend the summer and......,This book starts of really boring. It talks alot about the people in the book and about one person for almost the entire chapter.Around the 6th chapter it starts getting a little more interesting. At the end of the story something happens that you wouldn't expect to happen. If you like to read books that start out really boring and then hardly get any better then this would be the book for you.
2,The haunting of Hill House,"I did not find this book very scary, I was only mildly amused by this book. If you want a really scary book, I still have not been able to top The Amityville Horror."
1,not even close to being listed anywhere in horror/scary books,"I hate to say it but in this case the movie was scarier than the book and I could barely watch the movie with out laughing. I love horror movies and books, so was suprised when this book is so highly recommended. It was a huge let down if your looking for a good haunting story. I know that most people have read shirely jackson in school but this read should actually be read as a small child and then still would not frighten anyone..."
1,don't believe the hype,"It took me a whole week to finish this tiny 256 page book. Being a horror fan, I read all the reviews and figured I couldn't go wrong with this. Boy was I mistaken! 50% into the book and not a thing had happened. Nothing scary at all, just a bunch of background info and boring dialogue. Then after page 200, stuff finally started happening. But by then I was already tired of the book. Even worse, I couldn't stand the Eleanor/Nell character at all. I forced myself to keep reading this book in hopes that she would meet a nasty end.I don't need blood and gore to be entertained, but I do expect a novel that pops up on everyone's fav horror list to at least be scary. I would've finished this thing in a few hours if I cared to. Now I'm glad I didn't devote anymore time to it than I had."
4,The Robert Wise film (B&W) is faithful to the novel,"Just saw the first movie version of ""The Haunting"" this weekend, and I must comment that that one IS faithful to this book. It does what a movie adaptation should do: render what was on the page as closely as possible onto the screen.If you saw this summer's version, whether you loved it or loathed it, do yourself a favor, and read the novel and watch the first film. And compare for yourself which of this three is the real deal in haunted houses."
3,freaky but not really,"it was scary but not really because there were parts that were really boring, but as i was watching the movie it made me feel like the storyline was over-exaggerated, where as in the book it felt just right. im sure people who like a book to read and get spooked out on would love this book. and i suggest watching the movie if the book confuses you a bit."
5,This book is awesome.,"This is one of the best books I ever read. I thought it was better than the movie too. Even though it was confusing, after I read it about 2 times I could understand it. Over-all I thought it was scary and it was kewl."
3,Sateen it ain't,"While the product is well made, it isn't sateen or anything close to being a sateen. So, in that case I was disappointed in them since I hoped it would make stuffing in king pillow easier. Unfortunately it makes it even harder to do so."
2,Not tasty for cats,"This might be effective -- if you can get it in your cat's mouth. My cat fought me every step of the way. This was, in no way, a delicious tasting product for her."
3,Not bad...,"This item is for puppies...maybe BIG puppies! My little Toy Fox Terrier's mouth is still too small to get this brush into. I have yet to find anything small enough. I think I will try children's toothbrushes next time. Much cheaper, and darn near the same thing."
2,Didn't Work for Me,It didn't work for me. I took 4 caplets a day for 6 weeks and did not see any significant difference in before and after. Best of Luck!!
5,MI all over again,I loved it as a kid and now my kids love it. Well made and edge-of-your-seat adventure from a 70's series. Loved it!!
2,Not bad for occasional use.,"I got this thinking it was a cheaper alternative to the popular brands. I see why the other brands are popular. I only used it off and on for a year. The blade is still sharp EXCEPT in the one space needed to cut the wire. When you look closely it has a small chip so it wont cut wires anymore. I know two other people with the same tool, both of their springs broke rendering their tool unusable. I also found out it's hard to buy replacement blades. The type of blade this tool uses isn't sold at your local stores. An online replacement plus shipping was half the cost of the tool. It is comfortable to hold and use, and the blades hold well on the back, but overall it's definitely not for long term or professional use."
4,"An ""Outsiders"" Inside Look at Athens","While it might seem that the book could be a bit dated in light of the 8+ years that have passed since the 2004 Olympics, this book speaks volumes about the Athens of today with it sprawling landscape, political corruption, and undercurrent of racism toward the rapid inflict illegal immigrants. But being one who calls Athens ""home"", the author speaks with a sensitivity that no mere travel writer can replicate. He is not harsh in his criticism, only honest -as one might be with one's own family. Insightful & a quick, enjoyable & thought-provoking read!"
3,"Interesting, but could be better written","Interesting and often spooky stuff. Patterson makes the case that while the vast majority of the infamous ""Paul is dead"" clues were based on the lurid imaginings of overzealous fans, some appear to have been planted deliberately--as a hoax or for some other reason. The author captures the era and its obsession well, though the book is not especially well-written."
1,"SHODDY, POORLY RESEARCHED, INCOMPLETE","This book is shallow in its research, without even bothering to dig up the real story by conducting hours of interviews with the people involved in the ""Paul-Is-Dead"" rumor. Even the ""quiz"" at the top of this page is rife with errors---the title of the book, THE WALRUS WAS PAUL, refers specifically to the song ""Glass Onion"" (of which it is a key line), not ""I Am the Walrus"". If you really want to learn about the history of this rumor and its place in rock history, the book to buy is Andru Reeve's TURN ME ON, DEAD MAN, also available through Amazon.Com--- It's the superior tome."
2,"Occasionally interesting, but generally poorly written.",Not much to say...I've read a number of books on the Beatles and this one is definitely one of the lesser ones. Poorly written. Poorly researched. Could've been so much better.
3,Anti-Cold War Hardliners,"Although Craven played a large role in one of the most effective weapons systems of the Cold War, he positions himself as a relative ""dove,"" claiming that the Polaris was a ""deterrent"" sysytem as compared to systems backed by Edward Teller et al, which Craven considers to be offensive first-strike weapons. Craven apperars to be enamored of the MAD doctrine and thus opposes missle defense. For me the low point of the book is p. 87 where he blasts Teller for convincing Reagan to hang tough at the 1986 Reykjavik Summit with Gorbachev."
3,Super Reader,"Two people come to visit Doc at once, one with nefariou spurposes, and a disguised dwarf, at that.The small Balkan nation of Calbia is undergoing political turmoil, and it seems their Kingmaker decides Doc would make a nifty monarch.Not without a bunch of use of weapons, first, of course.2.5 out of 5"
4,Amazing as usual,"Flewelling's work has been a personal favorite since I discoved The Bone Doll's Twin last year. This is a very worthy sequel- and the woman sure knows how to write a cliffhanger! i found it early (someone up there must like me- i think my bookstore put it out by mistake) and finished it in two days. I loved every moment. A very, very good book"
2,WOW,"I cant beleve I done it again. I spent my money on anothe movie because of the reviews. Well first of I dont know what all these other people are talking about, the whole set was a bore. Yes there was gore and a few moments that were ok. But for the most part it was a waste of mone. I had rather watch PEE-WEE than this crap. ***********DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY*********"
1,if this book cost a cent...,...it would still be far too much. Take note of the bona fide reviews from victims (you can tell which they are because they have one star and not five) and do the sensible thing.
1,Convenient but inaccurate,"I purchased this recently. Last week I took it to my doctor's office to compare with the readings that the doctor and nurse obtained with a traditional cuff. We did four or five comparisons, and the wrist BP monitor was not even in the same ballpark. It wasn't consistently high or low, just erratic.My doctor recommends an arm cuff over any wrist monitor, not just this model."
2,HEM-609 Wrist BP Monitor w/intellisense,"If all that I were to rate was the ""ease of use"", this blood pressure monitor would easily rate 4 stars - it is extremely easy to use.Unfortunately, it is VERY inaccurate when compared with a cuff that goes on the upper arm. The readings on the HEM-609 are always low (which would be nice if my BP were that low), but when they are compared to the readings in the doctor's office they are unsatisfactory. As a result, I bought another old-fashioned ""hand-pump, read the dial with a stethoscope"" monitor, and that's what I use since it agrees very closely with the doc's office.I do not know if this problem (reading about 20mm low) is due to my wrist size (7.25"") or the individual unit I have or ???. Anyhow, there is certainly a problem, and the HEM-609 is unsatisfactory and disappointing."
2,Seems OK but one problem,"I've only had the opportunity to use it twice, for juicing carrots. It starts out seeming great...easy to assemble and juicing well. But before the juice container even gets one glass of carrot juice in it, the pulp reservoir fills and juice and pulp comes out of the top of the machine, dripping down the sides and counter top. I've never had a juicer before that couldn't handle one glass of carrot juice before it needs to be cleaned. The pulp didn't seem to be at a very high level in the machine when I took the lid off, but that's the only explanation I can think of for the problem I'm experiencing."
4,Does what it says,"I got this thing at Target for around $20 last year. I have the remote unit in my garage (the remote's not weatherproof) about 50' away from the base unit. And it (surprise!) tells me the temp outside, the temp inside, and the time. Had no problem picking up the atomic clock signal. I only give it 4 stars because the manual was lame (before I lost it), and I can't find a manual on the O.S. website. And now I can't figure how to turn off the alarm. But there's probably a similar manual on the website. In short, it works fine."
5,"Truly original, music that stands out. Take it everywhere.","God bless the day I added this CD to my collection. There are not many voices that seduce you like hers and music that offers original, talented work. It combines Jungle, House, and everything good about electronic music with good old-fashioned vocals and score. Good Lord, I love this band."
2,Not worth the money...,"There are two songs on this album, which you'll be able to listen to, even after some weeks have passed and you played it every day: - Lusty (of course) and - GoreckiThe other songs are poor, because you just can't listen to this very weak beat, even though the lyrics sung with a really beautiful voice will make you listen to the tracks in the first days.If you have enough money and you are willing to buy a whole album because of one or two good tracks, I recommend ""Lamb"", but, as for ""poor"" students like myself, I wouldn't (especially the CD-version, vinyl rules)."
5,OHMIGODOHMIGODOHMIGOD,"This CD hasn't left my player since I got it. Love the voice, the music, everything. I can't wait for Lamb's next CD."
4,"Lusty, the first track, is a pradigm of the future of music.","I think the first track of this album is absolute perfection. It consists of an irregular time signature, melodic samples, and vocals with both melody and harmony. It's everything i think music should be. Unfortunately, the rest of the album does not keep up. They should have made ""Lusty"" the last track, so that the rest of the album would have been leading up to something. I don't understand why if ""Lamb"" can sing like she does on lusty, why she doesn't do so the rest of the album. Either way, my money was justified with ""lusty"". If I were Lamb though, I'd stop working at sub-potential levels. This is a debut though, so the future looks great."
4,Fair Barry is Better than No Barry at All!,"Released by 20th Century Records after White left the label, I Love to Sing the Songs I Sing"" is not one of White's best. Most of the songs are of average quality, but White is such a master musician that even his non-hit stuff is infinitely better than most of his contemporaries and predecessors."
1,Too scary for children,"I read this book when I was 8 years old. I am 31 now, and I have never forgotten it. I was a voracious reader as a child, always 3-4 grades above my age. It was terrifying. I had nightmares for over a year and my parents actually complained to the library about its cataloging in the chilsren's section once they reviewed the book. The 1 star rating does not relate to the book's content but to its publisher's classification as children's literature. It is a horror novel, plain and simple. I would not recommend this to any reader under the age of 16."
5,The Indians of the Americas,Excellent condition and shipped in a timely manner. Bought for my husband who has thoroughly enjoyed it. He loves history and this book is very good he stated.
5,Cheaper online than the store,"I had been shopping for a new set of pants. I went to Wilco and Coastal farm stores and then into the city of Portland Oregon to the Carhartt Factory store. No luck finding my size. I found that ordering the pants online was cheaper in the long run and after 20 years of wearing Carhartt work clothes it has come down to getting the product where you can. Now that my regular stores no longer carry Carhatt pants over size 42"" wide there is no reason to go to them for a clothes. Just one more reason to shop online!"
2,"If you liked Hi How Are You Today, you won't like this.","This is not anything like ""Hi, How Are You Today?"" or ""Helter's Celtic."" Ashley said he was trying to make his new album similar to the soundtrack to ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" To him, this probably seemed like a good way to sell CDs, but to the listener it means annoyingly out of place mandolins and drums that sound like they belong in Branson, Missouri. It reminds me of the songs on his older CDs that I'd always skip like ""What an Idiot He Is"" and ""Whiz Kids,"" but even those have more charm than this. In my opinion, the only songs worth hearing on this album are ""To America We Go"" and ""This is My Father,"" and neither or them are anything to write home about.This album isn't necessarily bad, it just lacks virtually all of the redeeming qualities that were in his other experimental/fusion endeavors. That doesn't mean it doesn't have its own good points, but I'll leave you to find them. I gave up."
1,Don't waste your time,"This guy seems to revel in the prurient, vulgar aspects of his disgusting life as a thug in South Boston. He seems to think that a college degree and the fact that he is good to his kids makes everything OK. How a guy like this is permitted to walk the streets as a free man is a mystery. If half of what he says he did is true, then he deserves to be incarcerated for life without parole, he is a danger to society. He says Whitey was a crazy sociopath (true), well clearly it takes one to know one. Another mystery is why our public library would even stock such a piece of trash."
3,Another Self-Therapy Book,"Good Recreational read. Nothing too revealing, but another self-theraphy book from one of Whitey Bulger's enforcers. It was a way of life for the Southies."
3,Another Bulger book,"You can fill a bookshelf or two with books that deal with infamous Boston gangster James ""Whitey"" Bulger. Several of them have been written by former members of his gang, including Kevin Weeks and Red Shea. This book comes under that category, and like the others it doesn't add much insight into Bulger. The book is more about MacKenzie himself--rough upbringing, life of crime, redemption--and it's not a unique story. If you're a Bulger addict and you want to read everything available about him, then by all mean do not ignore STREET SOLDIER. But if you want a more complete picture of Bulger's deeds, I would recommend one of the books written by the Boston journalists who covered his heyday."
4,Gritty Read,"Eddie Mac is the most, 'approchable' of the writing Whitey associates. This is a down and gritty write from an inside perspective of 'Whitey' Bulger's Irish Mob. An excellent read for anyone interested in the inside workings of Boston's Irish underground. This book does focus much attention on Eddie Mac's personal life and what led him to his life of crime. Eddie Mac doesn't hold back, and tells it all, from the embarassing to the, so called, 'glorious.' Must read for those interested in the topic. Eddie does not glorify himself as some others do. In fact you are almost convienced Eddie is sorry for what he did. You almost want to console him, but watch out, he is dangerous!!!!!"
4,"Much More Truthful than Kevin Weeks' ""Brutal""","I'm an Irish-Catholic guy in his 40's who grew up in Boston in the late 60's and 70's. I've read Streeet Soldier and Brutal several times each, and I personally believe much more of what Eddie Mac has to say about the ""real"" Whitey, as opposed to the relatively reverant tone in which Weeks still speaks of Whitey. Sure, Eddie Mac and Weeks are both equally dangerous sociopaths, and will surely go to Hell (assuming it exists) for all the evil they inflicted on their fellow human beings over the years. Having said that, Weeks still seems to be loyal to Whitey, and probably knows exactly where he is hiding out these days. For that reason, I don't believe a word he says when he defends Whitey against allegations that he was a rapist, a child molester, etc. Eddie Mac definitely gives the reader more insight into what Whitey was really like...and isn't that why we all read these books, anyway?"
2,Ghost writer's dilema ?,"Whether you believe some or all, the author(s) have cashed-in on the ""Black Mass"" windfall just as many former 'Southie' sociopaths have done. Written for money, targeted at the prurient-voyeur audience.Without actually witnessing the acts, his co-writers-editors coaxed from the author, it is near impossible to know whether the central character now a somehow reformed sexual predator and convicted felon DAD is at all credible. There are many egocentric tough guy testosterone oozings about sex and self gratification and 'Southie' the current 'Whitey' worship-pulp rage. The authors omit the others separate from Eddie Mac's closed macho 'Southie' culture and miss all the good ethnic tribal stuff that came from that little spit of America. Was it the devil, poverty and drugs that made them do it?, likely money just now. We'll never really know."
3,v v V v v v v,"it is not very hard to win. i beat it in 2 sittings. it takes a long toime to load and is nothing like the first game. when you finish the game there's not much more to do. one of the reasons i liked the 1st game was its random funnyness this has none of that.i cant say its terrible though, iwould reccomend it, but to buy its not completely worth it."
4,nice and neat,"Contrary to the film, the soundtrack follows Tarantino's tradition, comparable to Pulp Fiction's soundtrack. I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed the film, hoping the soundtrack of the second part will be as good as the film itself.The only annoyance is the lack of coherency between songs, but it's the same annoyance you'd feel in the film..."
4,One of Tarantino's best compilations.,"Coupled with a few sound bites of dialogue from the movie itself (probably so we don't forget the context of the album), this is one of Tarantino's best compilations. As usual though there's a few tracks missing. He probably couldn't get the rights to put them on the album, is my guess."
3,Fabulous Film and Music!,"I don't like violence. I don't like samurai stuff. I don't like kung-fu crap. BUT, this is one of the most visually stunning, creative films that I've ever seen. I was taken to see it by my daughter and son-in-law, and I cringed when it started. But, I'm also open to new experiences. Thank the gods I stayed! This is not a movie; this is film, in the creative, artistic tradition of Bergman and Antonioni and Felini. The music is fabulous and is only rated low because of the missing tracks. I would gladly pay double for a full soundtrack. I'll certainly buy the DVD. For those who complain about the violence, get past it and look at the art. This is not a film to take children to, but I don't want to have nothing to see besides that which is suitable for a 3- or 6-year-old."
5,I didn't find a piece,"Do someone know the music that sounds in Kill Bill Vol. 1 when Kiddo will fight with the two first Crazy 88, when Oren send them and they are going to downstairs?"
4,Great Soundtrack to a Great Movie,"Just like Martin Scorsese and P.T Anderson, Tarantino uses music so brilliantly in his movies that it is practically part of the script or another character in the movie. Kill Bill is his most eclectic soundtrack yet. My only complaint is that the CD is only about 45 minutes long and is missing a lot of songs used in the movie. I would say the highlights are definately present and accounted for though. So far this is my favorite Tarantino soundtrack."
4,All that and and just a little bit more,The movie was great and the soundtrack fits it perfectly. Sound goes in through your ears and starts to get your blood moving before the opening scene with Sinatra's Bang Bang. Some thing so great can only have been put to gether by the RZA but alas. The only tune that isnt on this album is the haunting tune that Elle Driver whistles as she strolls on to give the lethal injection. If anyone knows where thats at let me know. If it wasnt for that small detail it would have gotten the max rating but this CD is a must have whether youve seen the movie or not.
3,Same issue as the Ghost Dog Soundtrack by the RZA...,"After watching ""Ghost Dog"" I could not wait to get the soundtrack, especially after I learned the RZA helped with it.It was dissapointing to see that the most anticipated songs and score of the movie were nowhere to be found in the CD.Then I obtained a copy of the Japanese version of the soundtracksimply brilliant, all I expected was there.The same happens with ""Kill Bill"", a good CD to have,but it seems I will have to wait until the Japanese importof the soundtrack is available at a costly price..."
1,Yuck II,Another Jack Link's product I tried since I love their Teriyaki Beef Steak Nuggets. I was hoping these would taste like prime rib but they didn't to me. I will not be purchasing these again but will keep my subscription to the above-mentioned Nuggets.
3,A bit dry.,"I found the book heavy on detail, and full of letters to and from the main person. As far as a vampire novel it sucks."
2,"Looks like wood in the picture, but isn't","Chest looks beautiful in online photos, but is a different story in person. For this amount of money, you'd expect wood, not hollow material that is painted to look like wood. Like another reviewer, our chest arrived with a large chip out of the front face of the marble. Box had damage in the same areas, so it was evident that the damage occurred during shipping."
1,Unbelieveably bad upgrade to the 2000 version,"I work with Publisher about 45 hours per month. This upgradeisnt. I give it ONE star because there is no option for ZEROstars. Why? The document is less controllable than 2000. Youcan do complex work at 32 pages with photos and graphics butthe pre-press is more a nightmare than the hassles found inusinf the 2000 version. If you were expecting Publisher to dosmall publications of high quality forget it and look at QuarkXpress or Adobe Indesign. You really do get what you pay forhere. the ""registration"" system on all 2002 MS software is ajoke. 2 installs? OK your desktop, then your laptop, and thenwhat if your hard drive croaks? You are out of installs!"
3,Microsoft Publisher Great for Beginner's...,"If you are a beginner at desktop publishing, or just want to put a personal touch on your calendars and other documents, Microsoft Publisher 2002 is the right choice for you! You will find that it is easy to get started using Publisher, because Microsoft has given you a plethora of templates around almost any type of document you could want. These templates are fully customizable, however so you will not need to worry about being stuck with one look. I prefer Adobe InDesign, however, because I have more flexibility and power to design the document I want. Honestly, I only use Publisher because an organization I am with has decided to use that. If I were new to publishing, however, I would find InDesign overly complicated and prefer the simplicity of Publisher. Don't get me wrong, just because Publisher is not as powerful, doesn't mean you can't create nice looking documents... If you are experienced, go to Adobe. If not, Publisher is right for you!"
3,The best that I could get,"I have Windows 98SE and unfortunately this is what was the best that was available for this operating system. With all these newer versions of similiar programs only functional with Windows XP, my computer will soon be completely obsolete."
1,What happened to my beloved Publisher?,"I am glad I decided to demo this product before actually purchasing it. Has Microsoft decided that we should take a step back with the new version? Rather than becoming better it has become a lot worse, losing some of its functionality and options. Yes, the interfaces are closer to the layout of other Office products, but at what a price! Especially web publishing has lost out in this version. The only improvement I could see was the ability to create e-mail newsletters - but I'd rather use the more complicated Adobe format than upgrade to Publisher 2002 and lose all the functions my current version 2000 offers!I am disappointed... the advertising literature sent to me by MS touted all these great new functions to ""look like a pro"", but did not explain that some sacrifices were made in exchange for these new options. I for one will not upgrade to the 2002 version."
4,it is useful book,"It is not the best first book of Linux or UNIX but it may be very useful if know what are you looking for. If you need quick initial training seeLinux and UNIX for a beginner training suite, 4DVDs + 2CDs includes 4 Unix Academy Certifications ed.2008."
5,A Christmas Visitor,This is a very emotional and loving movie. It shows what giving love to someone else can bring to you as a person and a family. You can feel what each person is feeling just by the words and actions. THIS A A GREAT MOVIE FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY. AWANAKARD
5,excellent,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was a tear jerker but heartwarming. Great holiday movie, especially for those who miss a loved one."
4,Warm and Fuzzies for Christmas,"Strong family fractures over a son/sibling killed in combat find their way to mending with a Christmas visitor with more than human ties to the son/sibling. Provocative, inspiring, emotional."
3,Production credits come off as distracting!,"While I commend Faith Hill for making the album Fireflies, I am a little put off by the production credit listings on the back of the CD. It's three producers, Byron Gallimore, Dann Huff and Faith Hill on much of the album. But Gallimore puts his name first for one set of songs for the trio. And Huff puts his name first on the other set of songs for the trio. The question I'm asking is--What's the point? It's the same three people doing those same songs! It comes off as complete grandstanding and one-upmanship among those two (Gallimore and Huff). Of course they can produce between the most commercial (Lonestar) and the more stylish (Lee Ann Womack) of country songs. I have never witnessed such bizarre credit listings on a music album like that! Hope they don't have conflict on a music awards show if Faith's album is even nominated!"
4,3/4 great.,"Overall this is a great album. Could it be better and more traditional sounding? Yes, but I do plan to keep it and not throw it away. Missippi girl is a great first release. I also liked Sunshine and summertime, Stealing kisses, and stay with me. These songs paint a picture telling a story, and have a good harmony and chorus. I am not too found of Paris, or the title track of the album fireflies but the good songs are keepers."
4,The real jewels inside this disc,...are the songs by gifted Lori McKenna. Can't wait to hear lots more from this talented songwriter.
3,Slight comeback,"A little better than her pop centered albums I've reviewed (Faith, Breathe). Would have given it a 3.25 stars if it was available, since it is a little better than the ""Breath"" album in my opinion.But lacks the magic of her first two albums. (""Take Me As I am"", and ""It Matters To Me"" to me are still Faith's best all-around albums)""Mississipi Girl"" was the winner on this album. Solid ""A"".""Dearly Beloved"" was a nice little humorous track, and a bit fun. ""B""Also liked ""Lucky One"". ""B""The rest were average to slightly above average.Nothing was below average, but the CD didn't inspire as a unit.Overall, a borderline ""C"" / ""C+"" as an album. Decent overall, but doesn't stand out."
1,oh no! not again!!,"Just more typical Faith Hill pseudo country/pop/rock??? Who knows what this stuff is...if somebody has an idea, fill me in. I hate it!!! Mississippi girl makes me sick to my stomach...the self gratifying lyrics and the poor vocals both. Stop buying this stuff and making folks with no talent filthy rich. We need both her and Shania off the radio (or on a new genre of radio for music nobody can identify with)."
5,Another Great Album from Faith,"For fans of Faith or newcomers, you will definitely enjoy this new CD. Very diverse mix of music, from ballads to silly. I highly recommend this album (i-squad:cneumann)"
3,So-so,"I bought this CD the day it came out because I liked ""Mississippi Girl"", but pretty much lost interest after the first three songs. ""Sunshine and Summertime"" is cute and on ""Dearly Beloved"" she sounds a lot like Rhonda Vincent (whom I love). ""Fireflies"" is vaguely cute and so is ""Paris"", but this disc is pretty much manufactured cheese, especially ""Nothing But Love to Prove"" and ""Lonestar""."
4,Heartfelt Faith,"First off, GREAT COVER! I enjoy Faith Hill. ""Fireflies"" is an album I like quite a bit. I listened to this CD the other day and I will have to admit that it really stuck with me. The songs and melodies are good. I really like the duet with her loved one Tim McGraw. Faith's delivery of the songs on this album has a comfortable and relaxingly smooth articulation about them."
5,Faith's Best Yet,"I can only imagine that reviewer Alanna Nash had just refilled her prescription of bitter pills when writing her ugly review of this CD. I will admit that I have always had a mixed take on Faith Hill's music. However, this collection of songs is really very good with one exception - We've Got Nothing But Love to Prove."" Hate that song. But, all of the others are good if not great. The musical arrangements are catchy if not emotional at times. My favorite things about this album are Faith's flawless voice and Lori McKenna's songwriting. Hopefully, there will be more of this to come. In the meantime, Alanna needs to stop taking bitter pills and congratulate Faith on taking steps in the right direction. Girl, I'm just sayin'..."
5,A Progressive Masterpiece...,"What an incredible piece of work from The Flower Kings! Every song is expertly crafted with the usual Flower Kings dynamics and gorgeous harmonies from the three vocalists. Daniel Gildenlow is an impressive addition to the band. I had read some negative reviews of this album, but decided to buy it anyway, and I couldn't be happier about it. This album is a must-have for prog fans."
4,Very good with a great epic,"I like this album very much, the opening song is a real marterpiece.Only for this cut (twenty minutes long), it is a must have for any prog fan. But this is not the only good one, in fact, I have enjoy this CD until the title track began, which is track number six, ""Adam & Eve"", Starlight Man and Timelines. There is still good moments in these songs, but in my mind they're a bit under what we are use to with the FK. A good successor to Unfold the future and one good work, for this amazing band."
4,short-n-sweet,"For those of you who like King's style and subject-matter, but deplore his wordiness, THIS is the book for you! This is the only King book I've purchased, read,and kept on the shelf (as opposed to donating it to the library)."
4,Great for teens,"I'm not a big Stephen King fan but Nightmares & Dreamscapes is quite good. I worked for three years as a summer camp counselor and when you have a group of 15 year old boys, they don't want to hear cheesy ghost stories or little kid stories. I read them a few of King's short stories and they LOVED them. While his Novels tend to drone on a bit too much for my taste, his short stories are just right. Some of the ones in this book are better than others, but they're all pretty good. I actually think the stories in ""Night Shift"" are a little better, but both books are excellent."
3,Hit or Miss,"If you're a King fan, I'd read this pretty good collection of short stories. A few stories are amazing (Umney's Last Case, Crouch End, and Dolan's Cadillac to name a few), and most of them are okay-good.There are, however, a few that made me laugh out loud at the sheer idiocy. For example: ""Rainy Season,"" a ludicrous story about giant, fanged toads falling out of the sky and attacking a young couple summering in a remote town; ""My Pretty Pony,"" which is not horror or interesting at all, about some old grandfather imparting some incredibly boring wisdom on to his unfortunate grandson; and ""Chattering Teeth,"" about a man who is saved from a homicidal hitch hiker by a pair of possessed wind-up teeth.All in all, however, a good book and a must-read for any King fan."
4,crimehorrordrama,"i like SK particularly as a short story writer. if he has a good story he never fails then. considering his other collections, this was not as inventive as the two previous. not as matheson-like as the first. this was a great collection. a bit mixed. the end of the whole mess and umney's last case seemed to be the most inventive ones. but his other horror stories were good too. there are even some crime stories here, they are actually pretty good. although SK delivers, his collection is all in all very readworthy, his writing style good, this collection marks the sad decline of SK. some of the stories are great, true. some of the stories, however, are only good in the hands of a master. and some of the stories are completely uninteresting. it's very enjoyable, but don't expect too much."
2,A sorry bunch of stories,"NIGHT SHIFT was a great read, SKELETON CREW was acceptable, but this collection of short stories is awful! The only exception is Umney's Last Case which is a wonderful story, rather unlike anything else I've ever read. As for the other stories; it's raining frogs? A vampire who urinates blood? Come on!!"
4,King's stories provide both chills and grins,"This collection of stories is typical King--you may not like every single one, but you're sure to find at least one that scares you and one that makes you laugh. My favorite was ""Dolan's Cadillac,"" a chilling tale of painstakingly-plotted revenge. Also intriguing is ""The 10 O'Clock People,"" a must-read for every smoker who has cut back but who just can't seem to quit completely. In ""Sorry, Right Number,"" King tries something new by writing the story in screenplay fashion; the gimmick doesn't necessarily add anything, but the plot itself is engaging nonetheless. On the scary side, l found ""Night Flier"" to be extremely creepy--the final scene will definitely make you want to sleep with the lights on!--and for a more light-hearted offering, there's ""Clattery Teeth."" Each story here is likely to have its fans; you'll have to read them all to find your own favorite."
3,"Some were good, some were not","I listened to the first volume of the audio tapes, and I have to say that I had mixed feelings about it. Dolan's Cadillac was very well read, Rob Lowe did an excellent job with it. I also liked Rainy Season, although I have to say that it was a little disturbing to hear Lisa Simpson reading Stephen King. Some of the readers aren't very good at reading out loud, though."
4,Buckley Rewrites Himself,"WFB Jr, in this autobiography uses old material drawn from his vast whealth of books, editorials, personal journals to detail his life. He writes about freinds he has had from the 40th President to the third James Bond, Roger Moore. He story is told with vivid detail from childhood to his life as a husband and a parent and a brother. His admiration of his father is total and his phenomal intellect is in full bloom. The weakness lies in that he dosen't really give the reader a ""tell all"" and fans of WFB may want to know more about less public aspects of his life. His clash in 1968 with Gore Vidal on ABC would be a great chapter. Buckley is always the writer and you feel you don't quite ever know Buckley the human being. It is a tremdeous value with a 48 minute CD introduced by CBS deal of media, Walter Cronkite."
4,not bad,"I picked up this book cause I felt like getting wrapped up in a new book that wasn't too long a book. I immediatly got wrapped up in this book and couldn't put it down. I am usually an Anne Rice type of reader and love thrillers and mysteries but this was different. I ended up finishing the book in 3 days and wished that I had preserved it a little longer. I still reread some pages that did not entirely make sense to me. There was one part that the book did not fully explain and I counted about 2 typos, no biggy. I guess I should see the movie but not sure if its the same title as the book. To break it down, its a great read reguardless if you are catholic or not. There is alot of religeous catholic talk and some of it is a side of catholicism that is overly exaggerated in this book but afterall, it is FICTION. I did fall in love with the characters tho =)."
2,Better than part 3 and 4 but stick with the first,"Silent Night,Deadly Night is owes more to Child's Play and Demonic Toys than a sequel to SN,DN part 1,2,and 3 but this one is better than part 3 and 4 but Mickey Rooney was wasted for the role as Joe Petto a drunk toymaker who abuses his oddball son Pino at least director Martin Kitrosser could have found someone better and the acting is horrendous and Screaming Mad George's special effects looked cheap but this offers more laughs than scares and the dark sense of humor fits in right.The SN,DN series is mediocre and if only they were made better after part 1 the series would have been decent but the reason this one is better than part 3 and 4 is because you could laugh and make fun of and instead part 3 and 4 are slow-paced and dull.Rent but stick with part 1"
5,essential,"The remastering on this set is outstanding.Bird was know for such things as his dexterity, speed, expanding the blues, etc. But with the great sound of these cds, you can hear Charlie Parker's beautiful tone with combos, strings, etc.The acoustic bass which is driving the rhythm can be felt and so can the ""bombs"" from the drummers. Desert island disc-when you can sing along with these solos you begin to appreciate this great artist."
4,This album is simply a must have.,Time and time again I'v returned to this to get my interest back in music. After periods of listening to new wishy washy over hyped releases I get turned off to having a night of music listening. One of my favourite ways to renew my enthusiasm is to put this on the cd player.It never fails and I never get tired of it. Its an unusual mix of pop/jazz/rock that is totally unique to this group.Sound wise my red book cd isnt the best but the music IS. For recording it gets 80% and music 96%. There is an SACD version out but the price is steep but must be worth it.
2,Asimov,"Didn't love it, a little too light for me. Maybe others will love more. Perhaps a better introduction. He was certainly no Classical expert."
5,This is the BEST of the Jerky's,"Oh my God! Sol's chainsaw shock literally made me pee my pants. Civil war memorabilia is hilarious, even the Kissel calls are hilarious. If you only buy one Jerky Boys CD definately make it this one. So go buy it now you silly bastard!"
5,Kissel Rules!!!!!,"I know I'm in the minority, but I love Kissel. I want to be exactly like him after I'm too old to positively contribute to society. Whether he's getting his TV repaired, inquiring about a dresser, or 'crooning', he leaves me laughing until I have to poop.Another great addition is 'Big ol' Bob'. With his enthusiastic 'Howdy Ma'am' he turns a bad day into bearable. Of course Tarbash, Sol, and Frank Rizzo round out the album. If you don't know the Jerkys buy them. If you know them and don't like them, why are you reading this??"
5,BAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,YOOOOO!!! BAAAAAAMMMMMMMMM!!!!!! THIS CD'S DA BOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMBBBBBB!!!!!!!!!! THE JERKY BOYS R DA SH.IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Disappointing,"Product arrived dirty and damaged. The outer rubber of the chicken was torn halfway up the body, and there are several holes in it. Very disappointing and I feel it is not worth the $6+ I paid for the item. If product had arrived clean and undamaged, would have been a neat stocking stuffer."
1,Cracking the egg on this one,"This toy lasted less than 20 minutes. Its head came off first, then the egg came out of where the head used to be. To top it all off, the egg popped and squirted some sort of fluid out.Don't buy this toy. Use the 2.99 for something more fun and lasting... like bubble gum."
2,Lacking Substance,"This book is short and brief, lacking in substance. I was disappointed after reading the good reviews, where's the beef? It shares some good ideas, but is basically an overview, perhaps for someone CONSIDERING a holistic practice and wanting to understand some of the elements needed. It was edited by someone unprofessional and these typos were irritating."
2,Disappointment Duplicate,"When I first read information pertaining to this book, I thought, ""great a new book with additonal new ideas."" Unfortunately for me this was not the case. I have read and own another book written by him with a different title: New Age Career Cycles - A Planetary Guide to the Patterns of Opportunity. This book is nearly identical to his current book, just a title change. What a financial and astrological disappointment. How ingenious of Townley to be a bit decietful by altering the title and alluring the reader to believe he had additional new material."
1,Escort 8500 - It's no Valentine One,"I've owned a V1 since 1994 and have loved it since the day I received it. As most of you probably know, Mike Valentine worked for cincinnati microwave (escort) back in the 80s. He apparently took all his secrets with him when he left, because since then the Escort/Passport/Solo detectors have gone downhill.I thought I'd try the new 8500, since I had heard it was a brand new beast. Well I was only able to try it for 3 weeks before it failed to turn on correctly (emitting strange beeps and the LCD going crazy). It did point out some true radar sources many times (like any cheap detector would do), but it also false alarmed most of the time it was on....It's just nothing compared to the Valentine One.If you are willing to sepnd the money on this detector, just drop another $100 or so and get a V1. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!"
4,The Queers still have it,"The Queers suprisingly are still convincingly kicking out energetic pop punk jams on this Split Album with Italian punk group, The Manges.Girl About Town is a great sunny, Queers tune that'll have you tapping your foot and bopping your head even after repeated listens. The recording is high quality and is the latest outing from the Queers, released on a Dutch label in preparation from their 2004 European Tour."
2,Extremely Bland Themes,"As a novice user, I was able to start using Frontpage 2002 the first day, but was very very disappointed in the Themes available to choose from for my small business web site. They are very very bland, unimaginative themes. Microsoft needs to add some good artists to the staff and listen to them. I am going to sell Frontpage and will use Homestead.com instead, which is slower and has a lot fewer features, but the Website Themes and Templates to choose from are much much more attractive. Homestead is also easier to learn. Frontpage is a lot better in one respect though, you can insert an entire Word document, tables, plots, graphics and all, very quickly (one click) and it all looked good except the photos. So if you are adding a great deal of Microsoft Office non-text material to your site, Frontpage speeds things up a lot there."
2,Buy DreamWeaver instead,"This software has absolutely NO support. The so-called manual that comes with it is limited and extremely difficult to understand. If you are going to buy FrontPage 2002, buy a book with it, you will be glad you did. I do not recommend this software, DreamWeaver is much better. Too many gliches in FrontPage 2002, and many web hosting companies have not installed FrontPage 2002 extensions, because of the bugs in that software. This causes problems with certain web files, either they are incomplete or non-existent.I am dissapointed in Microsoft for producing FP 2002, I expected a more suitable and proficient product. DreamWeaver costs more, but in the long run, it is well worth it."
2,Not fully compatible with other environments,"I picked this up for an employee doing an assignment for me. When it was almost completed, we had a need to switch to the Macromedia development environment, but the project had some embedded coding that was Microsoft/Frontpage specific. Also, the developer had trouble with the wizards that run as part of the package overwriting some of her manually-coded procedures, requiring her to enter the proc's repeatedly until she determined the problem. Also, the environment is not as intuitive as I was led to believe."
4,A great tool for a novice webmaster,"I have very little HTML experience and not much more in the webmaster department. I have tried previous versions of FrontPage and this one is by far the best. I was able to produce a professional looking web site in just under a month. The tools are fairly intuitive and the learning curve has been quick. I feel like I've got a powerhouse of a program that's actually under my control.Hard core developers seem to have a lot of criticism for this product, but it's great for beginners. I would recommend it for anyone who is a beginner to intermediate web developer."
3,"overall a great product, with some drawbacks","This product does allow some great web site building capabilities, however, i did not like the fact that if you did not subscribe to a website hosting company that supported microsoft frontpage server extensions, which only about 10 or so did, then you could not use many of the features when you published the website (i.e. submit forms, e-mail, surveys, etc.) this made many of functions useless. (this would be a drawback to those planning on using free web hosting services such as geocities etc.) but, other than that, this is a very satisfactory product that i would recomend, especially if you are planning on registering for a .com etc."
5,Love From the Other Side,"I received this album for my birthday. Didn't like it much at first. Almost gave it away to a friend. Then I received a call that changed my life. My brother had died. Saddened and shakened, I flipped on the stereo. ""Love travels, for miles, above the wings of Angels..."" came across the room. Mattea was singing from the soul of Bobby. The entire album is about treasuring all your life relations. It soothed the heartache and calmed the tears."
2,Bad Translation; Poor Printing,"William Arrowsmith is a very poor translator. He makes Hercules speak in hillbilly dialect, complete with misspelled words so we ""get it.""Also, the printing is terrible. None of the periods showed up in my version. That's right -- you can't see periods. Most of the other punctuation marks are smudged, and commas are missing their tail so they look like periods. Only a publisher of classics could get away with this kind of shoddy workmanship."
2,Out of Date,"This book is an easy read. I can see why it is popular with so many business travellers to Singapore as it details exactly where to go and how much to pay for action. If taken as a ""Rough guide to Singapore's Red-light underworld in the early 1990's"" the this is for you. Given the author wrote for FHM and is a model this accounts for the very readable 'magazine' style of the book. My biggest complaint was that is seems very out of date. I bought this in 2004 and most of the material and stories come from around the early 90's (most of it has changed now), although there are some small appendixes that give reference to 2000+. Give book's strength is the hard facts of how, where, and girls stories this seems out of date. The book's 3rd reprint was in 1997. (no first published date given)!!!Given the rapidly changing times following the downturn of the late 90's how much of this is relavant in 2004. Otherwise it is a 10 year old (highly readable) magazine article."
5,Worth every penny,"I love this book. The nursing situations portrayed are very realistic and hilarious (nursing in the bath tub, mom on the phone, nursing while cooking, etc). As you can tell from the front cover, the drawings do NOT show discreet nursing. If seeing bare nummies makes you uncomfortable, this is not the book for you! The book includes ""older"" children as well in their drawings. As I am nursing a toddler, I really appreciate the variety. My daughter can barely make it through the book with out asking for some milk. She asks for this book again and again!"
4,End of Titan era,This really is the last album of a Titan era. Which starts in the classic Cabea Dinossauro and ends here. Tits made classic albuns based in rock n 'roll and had a grunge metal trip which ends in the good Domingo.
1,Not worth your time or mine,"I see all these rave reviews and it makes me wonder what book these people have read. I found very little of merit in this hodgepodge. In fact, it's a cheap conglomeration of other books that have been done on the same subject. Not much original here at all. I suggest reading Ron Nyswaner's autobiography if you want something with a glimmer of quality and authenticity."
4,Well written but too sad for most folks,"The author is abandoned by his family at 17 and ends up being raped by a stranger. After that encounter he's discovered by a ""friendly"" manager who sells him to well to do women as a male prostitute. This aint Richard Gere in American Gigolo and it's not Deuce Bigelo either. There's no romance or beauty in the boy toy business.The book is not fun but it's well written. You get an unfiltered look into an ugly world. Luckily, the author escaped the chicken life relatively unscathed.How successful will this book be? Somehow I don't expect to see this book on too many people's coffee tables and I doubt that it will be cocktail party conversation."
1,not the prettiest video...,"Overall this will be a dissapointing purchase for the Axl Rose fan, technically very poor sound quality, and the Bonus features are unopenable, so one cannot view them. Repetitive and uncreative, avoid this one...."
3,Totally bizarre title?!?! What's up w/ that?!?!,"It's an ok DVD but much redundant information. It could be read in any biography in a fraction of the time. Not nearly enough footage of AXL, lots of the same footage, which resulted in a fairly boring video. The lack of GNR music helped contribute to the boredom factor. Every time a pivotal moment was discussed, I kept expecting GNR's music to come blasting on, further illuminating the scene. Oh well...The VH1 special (""Behind the Music"", I think) on the boys was much better (much cooler footage). Too many people talking...Anyway, I watched the UYI2 DVD right after, and remembered why I fell in love w/ them in the first place. Psychoanalysis we don't need as much as Axl being Axl on the stage."
4,Axl Rose: Prettiest Star,"If you are a Guns N Roses fan, like my self, this is one DVD you should check out. I learned alot about Axl, and how child hood was in Indiana, and also what alot of his closest friends thought about him. It was a DVD worth spending $20 dollars on."
3,Axl dvd,Thought this DVD was going to be a little bit different than it was. though it is a good collector item it's awesome more about groupies talking about axl and has a cute little quiz included within the movie. could of been a higher quality
3,just ok,"Price is right, but takes all night to charge (really, I dont know how long it takes because the phone does not recognize when it is fully charged). And honestly, I havent noticed all that much difference in how much talk time it will give from my original motorola battery when it was new..."
5,Dreamer of Oz on DVD,"This has to be the best movie I have ever seen. John Ritter was/is wonderful. The writing was excellent, too. When you watch this movie you will sure to be moved as I was. I loved to see how L. Frank Baum came to write 'The Wizard of Oz'. It is not easy to imagine just how an author comes to compose a story. As many times as I have seen the film, The Wizard of Oz, and that is dozens of times, I never once thought to myself, ""I wonder where Mr. Baum got his inspiration... you will be pleasantly surprised when you find out. I have copies on DVD. Email sojourn (at) frodelius (dot) com if interested."
2,Just don't get it...,"We bought this for my daughter last year when she was 2 and she played with it a handful of times when it came out of the box, but since then, it's been for the most part, collecting dust. When we bought it, we had read many positive reviews about it and therefore thought she would not only enjoy it, but that she would play with it for a few years. There didn't seem to be a point to the toy--there were a *few* things she could ""explore"", like pulling the ribbons and having music play, or sliding a button and having the ABC song play, but other than that, it seemed pointless. She lost interest rather quickly and I found that it continued to just sit in the corner unused."
4,GREAT GUNDAM VIDEO But a bit slow,This is another great gundam video that I realy liked.There are lots of good points but there are some drawbacks such as it takes a long time to get into the movie and to really get the plot going. There is also not enough episodes in the video but what they do have is great charater develpment and good dialuge. The best thing about this is that is has alot more action in this one than shooting stars. The animation is still and always will be quite stunning. I recomened this to anybody that likes action based cartoons.
3,"Not much of an ""Upgrade.""","Frontpage is OK in general, a bit hard to get used to. This version seems to have a few more web-bots, but I mostly felt obligated to buy it because my ISP doesn't support the Frontpage 2000 Server Extensions. FP still creates pages bloated with useless code and fails to really automate development of some of the hottest technologies in use today, e.g. XML."
1,Better off with ground meat... literally...,"I started off with FrontPage 97... and gradually worked up to FrontPage 2002. I used to think FrontPage was a godsend, boy was I wrong. Things only work if using MS Internet Explorer for a browser, or just plain doesn't work if your ISP doesn't support it's extensions.I now use Macromedia Dreamweaver. However, between using FrontPage and being able to afford Dreamweaver, I used a nice product by some folks with a funny name. A product named ""HotDog Pro"" made by Sausage Software! Funny tho it may be, their software is nothing to laugh at! It is a GREAT product, and costs A LOT LESS than MS FrontPage!http://www.sausage.com/products.html"
3,Nice but not a great upgrade,"Having tested other HTML editors (Macromedia, Adobe, NetObjects and Microsoft), I think that Frontpage is not the best anymore. This has some few new features and a facelift but that's all. If you are really serious creating web sites the best choice is Macromedia DreamWeaver 4.0, there is no product like that and if you want to create dynamic database driven web sites, Macromedia Ultradev 4.0 is simply the best.MS FrontPage is good if you want to create some informational web sites and that's it, but if you want to create something more powerful with interactivity then get the Macromedia product, you will not regret."
1,Why is Amazon selling this version of the DVD?!,"This is not an official DVD release. It's a poor representation of one of the greatest concert films of all time, and is also a bootleg version of the film. DON'T BUY THIS VERSION. Amazon.ca sells the only REAL version of this DVD(released by Universal) and it is a must have. But this? This is a travesty beyond words and anyone who buys it is a fool. It's literally flushing good money down the toilet."
3,"it's bloated, look at other choice before spend money","There is too little information in the book. First half of it reads like an introduction and could be expressed in couple pages. Why would sub 200 page book need 75 page introduction (first 3 chapters)?It is ok for american quality standards, but someone who has trouble to concentrate should not choose boring book. (they say ""bedside manner"" in editorial reviews)"
1,instructions are faulty,Gave instructions to place a pin in the holes you can see in the drawing. It was to activate the spring when mounting the hinge. No pin was included which made these expensive hinges useless.
4,Great mix of historical and paranormal.,"This was a really great read!A fascinating mixture of genres.Trust me, this is nothing like what you're expecting. It's much, much better!! I had some preconceptions of what this book would be and it really was quite different. In a good way!As one reviewer mentioned, the writer's style is very reminiscent of a mix of authors works while being something brand new and completely unique.If you like paranormal thrillers with some history thrown in, try this one. I found it very well written and well worth my time :)I received a free copy of this book in order to review it."
5,Psychic Fair- Incredible,"Psychic Fair is an incredible novel that beautifully weaves together the topics of family, war, time, and the supernatural. As a young reader, I want a book that is going to hold my attention throughout every sentence on every page, and Psychic Fair did not disappoint. It is so much more than just a ghost story; it is a story about love, familial and romantic hardships, youth, and revenge. I absolutely loved it."
5,J.J.'s Anthology brought me back to who I am - RELAXED,"I first came across JJ CALE, while skiing in Steamboat in 1998. It was a trip that my dad and I planned, since we've never been on a trip together in our adult lives. He is 67 and I am 35.We were staying with friends on this great ranch just outside of Steamboat. I was looking for some music and dropped this CD on the floor and JJ came rolling out to my feet. We didn't listen to another CD all week. We skied all day and came back and listen to JJ CALE everynight for 7 days while sipping on a little Baileys . We would sit for hours listening to JJ and bringing up all of the good times we had growing up and Dad just being my dad. Thanks JJ for keeping our priorities straight. It ain't all about making money - but instead spending time with those you love."
2,Didn't fit right,"I was highly disapointed in this product. The texture, lumps, and bumbs were awesome. However, the tunnel/hole is way too big. You'd have to have an abnormal thickness for this to fit on snuggly/tight. Although I would not buy this again, I would recommend it for a person who gets overly stimulated too quickly. I can absolutely visualize a ""short c--mer"" using this as great practice...nice feeling, put wide open spaces. Even when you squeeze it on your member, it still lacks the ""spark."""
5,OK I think CCS is better,"When I looked at the differences between CC and CCS, I relized that they ruined the show. Cut scenes, love is cut out, changed the dialouge into a whole different story, I relize too that Sakura is anoying in CC. Get CCS version. If your a CC fan get CC then. I dont care who gets what. Anyways, this video contains 4 great episodes of Sakura capturing the Fly, Watery, Wood and Rain, Shadow. Its so cute when Sakura and Yukito go to an aqarium like a little date. Atleast not to Sakura. The best! This is so Kawaii! Funny, full of love, action, and school life.""The key that holds the power of Amazon,Reveal your true form to me,I, Sakura, commands thee under convert,Release!"""
4,Sakura is here,"Well, I'm sure there are a gazillion reviews telling you how bad the CCS dub on Kid's WB is, but I actually think it is okay.However, it is recommended that the subtitled version be bought since Kids' WB is showing the episodes out of order, and it is painfully obvious to even the casual viewer. If a rep from Kids' WB manages to come across this review, I strongly suggest to them that they reassemble the episodes in the proper order, as it has no sense of rhythm to any viewer, which also may contribute to the lack of faith kids have in Kids' WB.So, why get the sub again? Well, the dub DVD and VHS release follows the order of Kids' WB's airing, apparently. So you'll get characters who use a certain power early on only to be introduced to it episodes later..."
2,Not good ministry,"I bought this movie as an alternate for the things we usually watch, and all I can say is, I am very embarassed that I am not able to watch it with my children, or let them watch it by themselves. Way too much sex, and explicit at that. If you have to buy Samson and Delilah, buy the one with Victor Mature and Heddy Lamarr. Good, clean, educational. And the whole family can watch. The action in this one was okay, but for a Biblical account, this is way too steamy for kids."
1,Stay Away From This Movie,"Not Very Good Acting. Actually The Acting Is Horrible. And The Movie Itself Strays From Scripture. The Cover Looks Great. But, Don't Let It Fool You. Like I Did. Bummer"
4,An enjoyable introduction to Andrew Llyod Weber's music!,"This CD has become a staple for our long car rides. My children have come to appreciate the variations of the tunes (some of which I grew up with) and have become so curious about the shows that we have either rented or purchased videos of what is available so that they can have the WHOLE musical experience. Our favorite tracks are form Phantom, Joseph, and Cats, but Barbara Streisand's-""As If We Never Said Goodbye"" is breathtaking. A truely enjoyable addtion to any music library--especially as an intro to Broadway Musicals for youngsters."
5,Great,"This CD is great for classic Broadway music! Pie Jesu is beautiful...I Don't Know How to Love Him is great...Love Vhanges Everything is really good, too. Plus it has classics like ""Memory"" and ""Phantom of the Opera"""
2,research vs. care,"Potok seems to discard the valid hope of alleviating the suffering of chronic spinal-cord injury. As a researcher, I know for a fact that these are not ""false"" hopes! Sure, don't sit and wait for them, live your life to the best of your ability, but research is making progress every single day, so I say to Potok, that's great that you're pressing for the equal rights of the disabled and have moved on and made a fulfilling life for yourself, but don't sit there and discourage other disabled people who have valid reason to look forward to not a all out ""cure"", but a greatly enhanced quality of life with some lost function restored! I don't feel you got in contact with some of the pioneering researchers abroad and in the US regarding spinal-cord injury therapies."
2,Not a good camera,"First off, I'm a picture whore. I take pictures crazy with this digital camera. This was a gift from my parents. It's alright for picture quality.HOWEVER, after awhile it just makes me pissed.1. I put fresh batteries in or they are still good. I try turning it on, but it doesn't go on, but goes off. The lenses opens up, but closes up. You have to click on button to turn it on over & over again at times.2. Spending money on 4 AAA batteries is not worth it.I had this camera for quite awhile though like 7 years about. Last month ago, it decide to screw up on me. Turn it on. The lenses screwed up on me. The display screen is black, which means the lenses was stuck (not open) I tried everything. Hit it gently against the desk & all, no luck. Now it's junk now. I'm upset a bit, because I love taking pictures & don't have a digital camera to take pictures with it. Although, at the same time, kind of happy, plan on getting a new & better one. Get rechargeable batteries as well too."
