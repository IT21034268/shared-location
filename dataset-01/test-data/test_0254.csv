3,A Mixed Bag,"This compilation of some of the induction ceremonies into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame during the past twenty-five years contains numerous jam sessions which often border on musical chaos. Frequently, five or six famous guitarists vie for the spotlight while Paul Shaffer tries valiantly to maintain control of the proceedings. What I wold have preferred would be more performances by inductees such as the outstanding renditions of ""Master of Puppets"" by Metallica and ""Sunshine of Your Love"" by the reunited members of Cream.This collection includes many induction speeches by famous musicians, some of which are articulate and fervent and others of which are nearly incoherent, or just plain awful. Finally, I think this four disc set is overpriced. I expected more for my money."
2,why no Led Zeppelin? & very chaotic editing,"leaving out Led Zeppelin is like leaving the A out of the alphabet.my other complaint is inductions are chopped to pieces & thrown across multiple dvds. a prime example is the Stones. Pete Townshend inducts them on Disc 1, Mick accepts on both Discs 2 & 3. His speech with Keith is chopped in both places. why not just have their complete acceptance speech in one place. definitely some butcher did the editing here.most likely, they'll release a correctly sequenced version probably in the future on Blu-ray & milk consumers for more money. until then we are stucked with this chop suey version.2 stars for the butchered editing, 4 stars for the material, -1 star for no Zeppelin."
5,Awesome collection!,"This really is a great collection! So much history in here, and a lot of things that I have yet to discover.One of my favorite scenes is the performance of the Beatles' ""I Saw Her Standing There"" performed by George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel, and John Fogerty.There's tons of coolness in here though, and I haven't even made it to the end of disk 1 yet.Definitely worth picking up, especially if you're a fan of what is now known as ""classic rock""! Would also make for a great gift seeing as the holidays are sneaking up fast!"
1,"Reviewing price, not product","Haven't seen this yet but it's a ripoff as a $299.99 so-called ""limited edition."" This 9-disc set is easily available direct from Time-Life on their Web site for $129.99. It's even cheaper (about $109) on the Rock Hall of Fame's site. Somebody's trying to make a quick and unfair profit here."
5,Another Example of an Excellent British History DVD,Most Americans do not know that the British Empire and Commonwealth had a part in the War with Japan. This Film does an outstanding job of explaining how the Japanese Army changed from a good solid outfit to one of the worst things to hit Asia since the Mongols Wars of the Middle Ages. The use of Survivors interviews and the very scary interviews of Japanese Veterans was highly effective. I was also very impressed with the additions of films on the British/Indian Army and its mighty efforts. They also did not shy away from the Renegade INF Army which I thought took some guts to tell. Also kudos toward the short section on the extremely brutal Burma Campaign. This film is well worth the time and coin for those interested in this area of history.
5,Jackson the way it used to be...,"And still should be. Before the millionaires and billionaires turned beautiful Jackson Hole into the playground for the ""elite"", it was habitated by hardy, frontier folk who worked hard, and played just as hard. Before designer skis, $100,000 sports cars and designer cocktails, people road around Jackson on horses, went for hay rides on sleds, and drank whiskey.If you like the West, and want to kow about the past, of one of the West's most famous destinations before it became the disaster of developers, then read this book. It is a classic on life before trust funds, silicone breasts, and nasty divorces."
2,Unreliable,"We bought six GE phones for our office and two of them don't ring properly, no matter what we try. The quality is just very poor and lots of other things have gone wrong."
2,A very dull and poorly defined movie,"We watched about half before losing interest and going to bed. No laughs and very generic characters that are boring, unrelatable, and pathetic. Poorly defined, a total waste of time."
5,Great Present for my Wife,I got this watch as a present for my Wife. She liked the watch and it came as expected in a great condition. The price is very good from Amazon
2,why bother?,"I find Dr Whitaker's work repetitive. I find him insulting to teachers and far too binary in his construction of good and bad teaching. Although there are some truths in this book, there is nothing that's not really common sense. And he doesn't push us to really question what it might mean to treat every student with respect and dignity. It's not a BAD book so much as not really worth your time."
3,What Great Teachers Do Differently: Fourteen Things That Matter Most,"If you have purchased the book by the same individual, What Great Principals do Differently: Fifteen Things that .......you do not need to purchase the book about what great teachers do. I believe it is a duplication. Many sections are exactly the same in both books."
3,good for beginning teachers (maybe),"the author gives some decent advice for novice teachers, but much of what he talks about appears to be aimed at school administrators.also, there is more than enough self-promotion sprinkled throughout the book (check the book's end)."
3,scarface,"Its not perfect, the picture isn't dvd quality because of the age of the movie I guess, its weird there not being more music in the background, but I thought it was ok. I thought there was a plot unlike another review said, its not worth paying a lot for, but if you can find a cheap copy like I did it might be worth looking into, I only paid a dollar for mine so if you cant find it too cheap dont buy it expecting a modern day special effect, musical score, and acting status movie, remember it was made in 1976 when thinking about getting it."
2,COULD THIS BE JACK PALANCE'S WORSE FILM?,"This appears to be a bad knock-off of a gangster film. In the opening scene we see Scarface (Jack Palance) get his scar. He shoots a man several times, as the man waves his arms, going into a comic death scene, he throws a glass ashtray (?) at the robber and nicks him in the face. This robber goes on to become a tough crime boss who smoke cigarettes with a long cigarette holder.Tony (Harry Baer) is a strong arm collection man with a rich cousin in Brazil. He meets another collector, one who works for Scarface and has less acting credentials. They devise a plan to scam some money and go to Brazil.The dubbing was bad. The transfer was bad. Acting and plot were bad. Fat men in muscle tees.Parental Guide: F-bomb (I think- bad sound too) brief nudity."
1,"this movie does not deserve to have ""scarface"" in the title!","this movie was easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen. it had POOR acting POOR picture quality POOR fighting scenes absolutly no plot and is definately NOT worth watching,renting, or buying."
5,Classical Guitar Construction,This book is actually on $23.95 and still in print.Nicholas ClarkeThe Bold Strummer Ltd
4,Pretty good book!,"This book I thought was pretty good. Sometimes it may have you reading page after page after page wanting to know whats going to happen next. Sometimes the book can get just a little boring though. Thats why I rated it 4 stars. If you are into mystery type genre books, try this book out and see if you like it. this is the third book in the series that I have read, and I'm planning on reading my fourth. I really liked this book, and I hope you will too."
1,A Complete Snooze,"Mr. Hardy, Frank and Joe are hired to locate a fortune in gold bars stolen from the Wakefield mint. Through the course of the book they travel to Zurich, Switzerland and the jungles of Mexico. This book was absolutely awful. The mystery is boring. Frank and Joe are no closer to solving the case at page 150 than they were when the book began. The reader is ""treated"" to a bunch of events that have absolutely nothing to do with the mystery (such as Frank and Joe skiing in Switzerland) and a bunch of boring cliffhangers. When Frank and Joe finally do solve the mystery, it's not because of brilliant or hard detective work, it's because they follow someone. If they had only done that back on page 25 the reader would be spared a lot of pointless events. The book is poorly titled because the jungle pyramid has nothing to do with the case on which they are working. The book is terrible, don't waste your money on it."
4,Fine charcoal!,The charcoal works fine. The pieces of charcoal themselves are a little smaller / more fine than I was expecting but gets the job done. I've used it for 2 years with my Whisper filter.
5,wilderness family trilogy,Dvds came in excellant condition and as they were advertised. when daughter played the second dvd it did not work. But family film was great about replacing the defective dvd. would definitely order from them again if they have what looking for.
5,Wilderness Family Trilogy,"I enjoyed these movies when I was a kid, and still do. Now I'm watching them with my brothers kids and they love them."
2,Wireless Phone Jack,"This product does not have caller ID and makes a hissing sound that is irritating. I bought it from BuyAccessories, who weregreat with customer service and refunded my purchase. I will buy from them again. It's not their fault the product is mediocre."
3,RCA Wireless Phone Jack,"This item works as advertised, but does not provide high-quality or clear audio.I tested it at an electrical outlet not surrounded by electronic equipment. It put out a lot of static. I installed it at an electrical outlet next to a power strip operating electronic equipment and got the same high level of static.Pros: It installs easily and provides an extra phone jack at the location where it plugs into an existing phone jack. This let me continue to use my landline phone. I did not expect this extra phone jack.Con: The audio quality of the telephone line that plugs into the remote receiver is poor.I will keep the unit because it provides an adequate signal for interaction between my receiver and my satellite provider. Otherwise I would return it."
3,Rollover....again,"I agree with the last guy. ""ROLLOVER"" is the best thing about this CD. Originally, this was supposed to be the first single released after ""Into the Gap""....oh well.....that's just another slice of the cake....and no one can say....1..2..3..3..4"
2,Thompson Twins disapoint with INTO THE GAP followup,"I have been a fan of 80's music since I was a kid, and I remember my sister giving me this tape when I was young, and I used to play LAY YOUR HANDS ON ME constantly until the tape wore out. However, by then, Arista had deleted this title from their inventory, I searched awhile, then last April, I found a used copy waiting for me for $6.50. I snatched the sucker up quickly. Anyways back to the music, The Twins had a major hit with this album, but much of this album leaves much to be desired. The album has an awful Beatles cover (Revolution), but however it does have 3 classics on it, the aforementioned LAY YOUR HANDS ON ME comes in the US mix, that I personally feel has more life to it than the UK version, another top 10 hit with KING FOR A DAY and the excellent YOU KILLED THE CLOWN. Get this one if you can get it cheap."
4,Amazing writing,"Many of the poems here are amazing. Margo Piercy has a way of personifying things,and making creations you would never imagine. I enjoyed her writing, and her works are not predictable. Good stuff."
1,Can't Play it.,Looks like it would be a fun game but I am unable to load it and get it running. Contacted UBISOFT but they just ignore me. Don't buy it!!!!
4,Easy to burn time.,It's a pretty solid game. It's easy to forget about the mission and just spend tons of time gathering resources and building up your settlement. The learning curve isn't too steep; it takes some time to get used to everything but then it gets easy to control. A lot of fun with a lot to do and a lot to keep track of.
4,Useful workbook to learn about ANNs,"Well written workbook for the interested general reader to gain an understanding of neural networks. Although some workbooks come with neural network simulator software for a personal computer (mine did not, and I was unable to evaluate the simulator), the printed workbook itself is extremely interactive and has the reader work through simulations of simple neural networks. This workbook covers the perceptron, minimum error learning, Hebbian learning, competitive learning, attractor networks (single layer, double layer and statistical), and back propagation networks."
1,Big mistake with hard water...,"Unfortunately I purchased this shower filter before I read the bad reviews on other sites. I read that I could expect the cartridge to block up with in days if I lived in an area with hard water and they were right. I figured that I could take the cartridge out and use it as a regular shower head, but it leaks terribly without the cartridge in place. I now shower under a pathetic dribble and am considering punching holes through the cartridge so that I can still use it."
3,"Rough, but good","This is an interesting movie. It is essentially a character study of the main person, a police officer. The movie does have a conclusion, but the discovery of the main characters thoughts and feelings and how he got that way are the main focus.Instead of falling back to the usual movie shorthand of having him explain everything he is thinking and feeling to his partner, here the exposition is done by using extended flashbacks along with background sounds that evoke memories and tie together related scenes. It is actually done very well, though some of them are a bit long and could be trimmed.One thing that really hurts the film is the sound quality. It is difficult to make out the dialog, and it doesn't help that the main characters have accents. This is a consequence of what is clearly a very tiny budget. This movie could really benefit from a good boom mike.Overall, a nice early attempt by a director who has quite a bit of talent. It will be interesting to see what he does next."
5,Great and a little FYI...,ok...hey guys im just here to say how much I love this series but give yall a lil FYIFYI- I believe this isn't the end of HL(heartland) because... 1 Lauren Brookes well knows not to leave us figuring out how Spindle turns out and if Amy makes it to be a vet and where Ty and Amy's relationship goes...sure it is a promise ring but their is always a left or a right and what happens to Jack and Nancy and what happens with lil' Lilly ect... so their is faith HL fans...we can start a petition if she doesnt...P.S. Chestnut Hills is a great series my friend in Europe is reading it now and loves it!
3,"cute, but don't offer much protection",These are so cute I just had to get them for my daughter! However the silicone is thin and the heat from pans goes through quite easily. Works fine for taking baked potatoes out of the oven or moving a turkey to a platter though.
4,Hot heads - would like more,"I thoroughly love this product, however I ordered TWO pink mouse hot heads originally & when they said it would be ""early to mid Dec."" before they would ship. They recommended that I choose something else available to replace it. I chose the dog, thinking I would receive 2 with a credit for the difference of the 2 pink mice. I received 1 orange dog and was charged for 2 pink mice. I still love the dog and gave it as a gift. Would order more but would like a credit for the original order.Nan-doll1"
2,Too General,"If you want to know the general idea of what radio syndication is then this may be something you want to get. But one of the most important areas of syndication which is sponsorship is too lightly touched on and the focus of the book is mostly talk radio.What definitely should have been included was how sattelite syndication works, along with how the internet can be a helpful tool.Some of the editing needs to shored up also. An O.K. beginners book but seems a little rushed."
3,Quality could use improvement,"I loved the story and so did my daughter, however the picture quality is poor, like generations of copies or something. We are able to watch it and enjoy it still, but if you insist on a good quality picture, you will likely be annoyed with this."
5,A must read!!!!!,"I've just turned 13 and I think Freelance and the Lake of Skulls is a funny horror book which has the things to make it a good horror story, like an evil lord and a brave hero. It has an exciting plot. Another good book by Paul and Chris. Can't wait for book three, better get book two."
5,Very cool dripless umbrella,"I own one of these, and its great. Keeps my floors dry and more importantly, it keeps my car interior dry too. Plus, I walk to work so its great to have an umbrella with me during the rainy months."
2,Doesn't work in the U.K.,"No drip rain umbrella? Pah! The first time I used this feeble device the skies opened, the rain came down and I almost drowned.This umbrella might work in Albuquerque but it failed to improve British weather patterns, to be fair it did manage to keep the downpour from moistening my head.I wonder if the manufacturer has overstated its effectiveness or maybe it is specially calibrated for U.S. weather patterns...you know, like DVDs."
5,The Best of The Toasters!,"This is one of my favorite CDs I have. It has a great version of ""Mona"" and ""Woyay""(Entitled ""Jack Ruby Jr. meets Dr. Ring Ding""). In fact, Dr. Ring Ding makes a great guest appearance on it."
2,The shoes slip tooo much inside,"I have bought the shoes for playing basketball indoor. But the shoes slip so much, so I cant play basketball, even if i can not run also."
3,Fun Reading...Good advertising,I am a seasoned investor.PROS: The book is very interesting and well written. There are a lot of interesting ideas. CONS: Basically an advertisement for author's website and services. Take what you can from it.
2,I'd take a pass.,"Upon receiving this book, I was very excited. I run a hedge fund and am always looking for new ideas in terms of analyzing the markets and the individual stocks in these markets. So CHANGE WAVE intriged me. But I soon found out that this is nothing but a 300 page add for their websight. Do yourself a favor, buy something else. You might say well why 2 stars. I found one good idea. If you have a dominate company in an industry & a small company makes a deal with them; the small company is a good buy. I had not approached screening for stocks this way so this is helpful."
2,"High on features, low on quality.","Good: The digital display and defrosting features are nice. The cord wraps up nicely under the unit as well.Bad: Plastic case feels cheap. Lifting mechanism feels cheap. Mine doesn't lift food all the way up when done. Manual lifting is required as the automatic mechanism only ""pops"" the lift up about 1 inch. Slots are not long enough to accomodate two pieces of wide sourdough."
2,Not the performance I would expect for the price,"I purchased this toaster because I needed one that was narrow and because it had received good reviews. Although it's adequate, it's certainly no marvel. It browns toast irregularly - the top of the slice gets brown while the bottom remains untoasted - and the settings seem inadequate. If I place a thin slice of bread in the slot, it does not get reasonably toasted even if I put the machine on its highest setting. I don't have any other complaints. It's certainly a satisfactory unit, but nothing I would recommend or purchase again."
1,flimsy,"There's little to say about a flimsy paper sleeve. It's the flimsiest of them all. Just don't buy these. They're flimsy. They wrinkle by themselves. And one last thing, They're flimsy."
5,wonderful,Vamped was wonderfully written and imaginative. I laughed my way through the entire book and found it to be a breath of fresh air in the vampire genre. I would recommend this book to everyone and their mothers.
1,"Wow, this book sucked (heh).","If the Lifetime channel went out one night, and you were in desperate need for a heartwarming father daughter tale, here is where you would look. If you were looking for a dark, wry look at a world of modern vampires, please keep on walking. This is book has the fuzzy light on it the whole way through, and there are so many intelligent questions that go unanswered- for example: A mortal child, alone in a world of only vampires, and no one is even going to try forcibly abduct her? Puh-leeze.It's a sweet book if you're a goth father with a daughter, maybe."
2,Catholic Vampires!,"How much more awful is it when an author whose previous novel you've loved writes tripe like this? This book was stultifyingly dull with occasional humor in the background. Not recommended. Try RAPTURE instead. Or try anything else, either. This is an overlit half hour television sitcom padded out to almost FOUR HUNDRED PAGES! Now THAT is HORROR! And ETERNITY!"
4,Where's the 3rd?,"The Hyde Effect is probably one of my favorite werwolf books. This is a worthy followup. I like seeing the characters again and following down into the world of the shifters. It reminds me very much of the Necroscope series in the way they shifters exist. I've been waiting forever for another, I can onyl hope there is one to continue the story. Left on a bit of a cliffhanger in my opinion and would love to read more."
3,depending on your cat i guess,"i know of one cat who craved this product.. meowed everytime he saw the box. Bought it for two other cats, and they could go either way with it. so but one box and see how yours reacts and then buy a lot!"
1,watch that did not work,i ordered the watch with great expectations. once my wife opened it for her birthday gift...it did NOT work. What a disappointment.
3,"Some good, some blah","Roadrunner as a label is above most other labels with bands like Fear factory (dino is a god). The first track (Dagger?) is the best one with Howard's singing and the almighty Jeff Waters gracing us with his solo! (Btw, check out Annihilator if you haven't already) The rest of the cd is filled with hits and misses sometimes in the same song. And Matthew Heafy as a team captain?! Come on, how much knowledge can this dude bring to the table being 19 yrs old? Trivium is a mediocre band at best."
2,Funny but fake.,"Some of these tracks are staged, I recognize some of the voices from other cds. Some of them are even robbed to add tracks. little kids calling Burger king, lame"
3,More of the same!,"This is where I went wrong: I bought two different CD's from the Touch Tone Terrorists almost back to back. The first I received ""A Momentary Lapse of Reason"" cracked me up throughout. I enjoyed it and people with me did as well! The second CD ""Customer Service Crackpots"" is also funny (do not get me wrong) but is just the same as the first. Same voices and basically the same approach so really buying one is enough. That said, I rated it 3 stars if only because I did not find anything better than the first. Same voices and a great gift for aggravating callers. Let's just say that for now enough is enough. These are talented individuals but one or the other CD will do the job, not both!"
3,Works fine,"This product was recommended by my son's physical therapist. Cover-Roll performs as advertised. Unfortunately, the Leukotape P Sports tape it came with was NOT effective (didn't stick well) and had to be purchased elsewhere."
3,Ok book,"I bought this book right after I had been obsessing over ""Go Ask Alice"", I assumed it would be just as good, but it wasn't exactly as good as I thought it would be.The story is true and very depressing, but some stuff Jay did seemed pretty unrealistic or weird to me, and I found it extremely depressing, more depressing than any other Beatrice Sparks books I have read. I found it hard to relate to this book as much as I did to the others, and it was very tragic.Still it was not bad and definately a worth read."
5,"Horrible, and great all in one.....","This book is terribly tragic, and teaches a great lesson......IF you are brave enough to read it. This is the scariest book, or movie I have ever encountered in my life. Nothing has ever scared me so bad as this book. I was reading it at night, and I actually only had about 7 pages left, but i couldn't finish it, because it was too scary. I actually slept with a light on, and couldn't sleep for half an hour. I DO NOT recommend this book to anyone under the age of 18. Thanks, and Good luck reading it. But, don't say you weren't warned......"
1,just another reason to disbelieve religious fanatics,"Just another reason to disbelieve religious fanatics. If people were really able to determine who the author was really talking about, why isn't she being sued for libel? This is a work not simply fiction but someone lying to others for profit, and simply another way to deceive young people."
5,great book,I would really recommend this book.I've read this book a long time ago and am now buying for my collection.But really think that it dives into alot of interesting subjects and is a complete no let go book!
2,standard apocalypse novel,"I would give this book high marks for conveying the atmosphere of fear during the Cold War in Middle America.As for the rest, though, it's a standard nuclear apocalypse novel, not particularly better or worse than any other.Still have yet to read one in the genre that outdoes Stephen King's ""The Stand."""
5,My Review,This was a very good book. I have read it about 15 times in less than a month. This book almost predicted what i think world war 3 will be like. I would tell any teenager to read this book. it is kind of too old for a 7th grader or younger but anyone over 13 years of age should love this book.
2,A GOOD BOOK WITH A SLOW START,I REALLY DIDN'T CARE FOR THE BOOK HOWEVER MANY PEOPLE DID. I THOUGHT THAT THE SLOW START OF IT KILLED THE EXCITEMENT. WE AHD TO READ THIS FOR 8TH GRADE ENGLISH AND OUR TEACHER LOVED IT. I READ MOST OF IT BUT IT GOT BORING UNTIL PAGE 150. THAT'S WHEN THE ACTION BEGUN. THE ENDING WAS ESPECIALLY SURPRISING.
2,This is a classic????????,"This book had an intresting concept, but a weak plot. I didn't feel like there was a begging or end. If it wasn't for my 8th grade Sci-Fi teacher I would have never bothered reading this book. I would have given it a single star but the concept is too unique to give an everday remark."
1,Cold War Hysteria,"ALAS, BABYLON is the story of a washed-out lawyer living in small-town Florida in the 50s. In the aftermath of thermonuclear war, he becomes the leader to rally his family and neighbors to survive in the desperate situation.I'm afraid I can't say much to recommend this book. The characters are flat and uninteresting, with persons of color and women portrayed as the barest of stereotypes. Far too much time is spent in the beginning of the book describing the chess-like moves of the USA and Soviets that lead up to the war. This book is probably typical of the mentality of the 50s, but seems extremely dated to a modern reader. The `group of survivors after a world-wide catastrophe' has been done much better by other authors; for example THE STAND by Stephen King."
3,Sci fi as history,"As a piece of literature, AB is a dud. Though Frank is capable of some fine turns of phrase and interesting character sketches, he's also far too prone to lame dialogue and weak storylines. To the extent that AB sheds light on the 'mentality' of the Cold War years, it is of some historical interest. As a read, however, it's pretty weak."
3,Cold war vs Terrorism,This book was written in 1959 at the height of the Cold War. The world was skittish and fearful of a nuclear war. What I thought was so interesting about this book was the difference of fear of nuclear obliteration vs. terrorism today. Both involve surviving and both involve changing the way you live. it's a good read
5,Survival after nuclear war,How people come together to survive and to start planning on rebuilding their lives and country. Written in the late 50's but just as appropriate today.
4,"Excellent read, questionable science perhaps though.","This book was EXCELLENT! I love after the bomb books, always have. Once I got about a quarter of the way into it, I ended up staying up almost night finishing it! If you want to lose sleep, read this book....I couldnt put it down!It is an excellent book, more of an adventure to me, and the only thing negative in this book that I found was the fact that some of the science behind the nuclear fallout and such wasnt exactly accurate, in my opinion. It made a great read though!One more thing I loved about this book, and was very impressed by, was the fact that the main character ( the hero ) was not at all racist, while many of the other characters were very much so, and the author made a point to make that known. Very enlightening for a book that came out in 1970, when that sentiment was not as popular as it is today. My compliments to the author on this!"
4,"Alas, Babylon","Enjoyed this book very much, as did others in my book review club. Easy read - read the book in two days."
4,Classic End of the World,"This is a classic end-of-the-world book. I felt it started off a bit slow but really picks up from the middle to the end. It's a bit dated but it doesn't really detract from the story. There isn't very much in terms of character or relationship development. The story also seemed to have more instances of ""Time Passes"" as you progress in the book. Overall, a really good book. It is the one that started me on ""End of the World"" type books and is worth a read."
5,Human; intensly human.,"Think of the time in which this book was writen. The Russians were still the bad guys, SAC was still a military entity, and we were all building bomb shelters in our back yards. The story is fantastic."
1,Play doh,This stuff does absolutely nothing. Silicone sealant does 100% better and its not an adhesive. Save your money.
2,Ok to watch when it comes out on the Tele,Not worth the purchase. I dont think the acting is that good and it comes out on cable tv once a week!
2,OK.........,"this would have been alot better if it was an american movie. there is to much drifting. they dont race like amercans. if you like the other 2, than you probaly can live without this."
1,"A Typical Male Movie: Cars, Girls, And No Sense","I mean, nothing made sense in this movie and it literally made my head spin. Nothing but fast cars, severly underweight h00chies, and plenty of rock/hip&hop music. It was like watching an extremely long music video. Sean is supposed to be in high school, but as old as he looked I guess he was on the 10 year plan. On top of that, he talked like Forrest Gump. In order not to go to jail, Sean moves to Japan to live with his dad. Sean was able to find himself a crew real quick. And if he and his friends were suppposedly in high school, how come they had so much time to race, fix cars, and go to parties? Shouldn't they have been studying for entrance crams? If it wasn't for Bow Wow and Vin Diesel (small part at the end), I never would've watched this waste of a film."
3,not what I was looking for,"I was looking for more of a journal. No enough space for journaling or comments, but the format is good"
2,could be better,There's only space for 4 sets of any one given exercise. Not real useful on days when you do 6 or more sets. But at least the boxes allow different weights and reps on an exercise.
4,Great journal for Weight Lifters and Fitness Buffs,"This is a great journal for a variety of reasons. It has lots of room for the number of things that weight lifters keep track of (e.g., exercise name, sets, reps, amount of weight lifted, etc.) and also allows for weekly goal setting, nutritional info. and progress. It also has room for other exercise activities, aerobics, running, cycling, etc. The spiral bound notebook is tough and looks new even after repeated trips to the gym. Overall, this is the best fitness journal for weights that I've found. My only suggestion would be to provide one or two additional columns for 5th and 6th sets of weight workouts."
4,A suggestion for the publisher,"I'm on my second BodyMinder Workout Journal so obviously it meets my needs (although I do not need all the dietary pages). One suggestion is to include a place to store a pen. I'd be willing to pay more just for a little pen holder on the cover.The only negative is the awful price sticker on the back. It's impossible to get off, and if you try alcohol the color comes off. Please - do you really need a sticker on an item from Amazon??"
5,bodyminder,love the diary. It makes tracking progress so much easier!! I will definitely get more when this one is finished :) :)
5,The Perfect exercise log!,"I've really been searching for an exercise log that also contained room for my food entries. This book gives equal space to both of these aspects, which is really helpful because they go hand in hand. I love using the book - it's very easy to use and eye-catching so you want to write in it. I've finally found it!"
5,Web Wise - Great Book,Web Wise was extremely helpful for me in getting started with the Web. Mr. Crowe's explanations of the web was extremely informative and useful for us. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in getting their business started on the Web.
2,false teeth,"quite a rip off, i do must say. I mean they are plastic teeth that are cheap. I don't think anyone could wear these but for s couple hours even if their life depended on it."
3,Fun but cheap,"This set of teeth is about as inexpensive as any goofy fake teeth out there, and the price is an indication of the quality. The teeth are every bit as white as pictured, which means they have an unnatural, bright glow--especially for redneck or vampire teeth, which you might expect to be a bit more yellowish. They're a sort of flimsy rubber susbstance. Unlike other fun fake teeth, they don't have any gummy substance to keep them in place, so they tend to fall out. But the bottom line is that they're fun and inexpensive. So what you see--and what you pay for--is pretty much what you get."
4,Lots of fun for 12-year-old boys!,"These prove tons of fun for my pre-teen son. Many laughs around the dinner table.Only thing not giving it 5 stars is the teeth are way, way too bright white, so that makes them look fake. They should be more naturally-toned (more yellow) to really look authentic.Then again, authenticity is not really the aim."
2,"Painful to use, but at least it's cheap and doesn't break easily",I've tried about five different dental flosses and this was one of the worst.Tended to cut into my fingers and fray on my teeth.
5,An Amazing Book by an Amazing Man,"Ward Connerly is a true American hero. While politicians' backbones--particularly from the Right--are increasingly missing in action, Mr. Connerly's book is a welcome breath of fresh air. Mr. Connerly's highly principled character is evident on every page, from his broken-home childhood to his courageous leadership in the movement to end discrimination. Liberals won't find much comfort in Connerly's attacks on affirmative action (which he labels a ""racial version of the Special Olympics""), but for those who still believe that we're all capable of making it in this world without Uncle Sam's help, this book is nectar. Mr. Connerly, you are a ""mane""!"
4,Cameron's work on view....,"During the second half of the 1940s and into the early 1950s cowboy actor Rod Cameron ranked up there with Scott, McCrea, Rogers, Elliot, and others. He was a staple ""A"" budget star for Republic Pictures, making a number of very entertaining oaters. RIDE THE MAN DOWN is one of his better ones, and well repays viewing. The plot is complex but handled deftly. Cameron's acting is quite good, in the tradition of the rugged cowboys of an earlier generation. Supporting roles are handled well. Don't miss this one--it'll make you wonder why more of Cameron is available."
5,Works for me,"I have a couple of these cables that I bought a long time ago but never had a use for until this week. I was skeptical that they would work as advertised, but I needed to run a cable for TV from a back room, along the outside of the house, and into a room on the front side. This seemed much easier for me to do than running cable through the attic and walls. Problem was, I would need to drill a hole through the front wall and install a connector plate inside. Then I remembered these skinny coax cables and figured it was worth a try. I used one through a front window and one through a rear window, connected a 100-ft. cable and turned on the TV. Works fine!Our windows are the modern aluminum type with thin thermopane glass. The edge of the window sill that the cable has to traverse is rather sharp and crimps the cable, but I still get a good signal through the cable.Jim -- Louisville KY"
5,This is an excellent book,"Kansas Charley is a fascinating book which ably combines American social and cultural history, developmental psychology, and legal studies. The book traces the story of an orphaned yboy who descends into impoverished and desperate circumstances. He ends up killing two other youths and is ultimately put to death. Kansas Charley recounts this history, but does more. The book paints a fascinating picture of 19th century social life and places Charley in context. It also does an excellent job of connecting modern day attitudes towards juvenile crime and punishment with their historical roots. This book is very timely given current debates over the fate of Lee Boyd Malvo and other children who kill. I'm a professor of U.S. cultural history and think this is a wonderful addition to the scholarship on the history of childhood and the history of American social life."
4,Heavy on Motown,"Any girl group collector is going to want to have this gorgeously packaged collection, beware however that about half of the material I would categorize as Motown or R&B. If that's OK with you, fine, but if you're more interested in Pop or girl group rock I would advise getting the superior Dream Babes series instead. Indeed, some of the best tracks on this collection are also in the Dream Babes collection. Having said that, there are some real gems on here that fall into the juvenille delinquent genre and which should have been in Dream Babes. Disc 3 is a killer, the booklet that comes with the collection is invaluable and the set is a valued addition to my Girl Group collection."
2,sounds the same,"There were some treasures in there,that have not been played to death on the Oldies stations.But many of the songs started to sound the same,disk after disk.Cost too much for what you get."
2,Not the big hits,"This is a collection of the lesser singles, if not outright flops, by the groups. You want to hear ""Leader of the Pack"" or ""It's My Party."" It is almost as if this is a sampler that Rhino put together to push the complete greatest hits of each artist.Maybe they decided that the top hits are available somewhere else or Rhino has released that in some other form."
5,The Family Bible,The DK Illustrated Family Bible makes for a wonderful time while reading to my children. Children always seem to have questions and this bible helps tremendously with its wonderful illustrations. If christian values are something you wish to instill into your kids then you need one of these to read to them.
2,Damaged!,"This order came swiftly and the price was right...or so I thought. Price was right because the binder was defective. Unfortunately, the front AND back edges of the binder were already torn as if someone had taken scissors and cut it! I am planning to return this ASAP."
1,very red and small,"This binder is very red and when I get in it I feel quite confined, and confusingly enough, like I should get out and cook dinner el pronto or else."
4,Good Stuff,"I read this book in 1994, at a time when I was covering police for a daily newspaper about an hour from Chicago. An enjoyable, engaging read!"
1,Great for those looking for negative portraits of Israelis,"Bundy writes a truly mediocre book full of all the false petrodollar-well-funded anti-Israel stereotypes. Don't read the book if you are interested in gaining any insights into the situation in the Middle East. Don't read the book if you are interested in reading a well written or interesting fictional mystery. In short, unless you are in prison and this is the only thing given to you to try to kill time don't waste your time with this book (and in that case just read it to laugh at how bad it is!)."
2,Dull and generic,"This book definitely hits one of the few sour notes in an otherwise high-quality 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' comicbook series. To start off, readers are given a somewhat generic story of Oz wandering through Hong Kong and Tibet in search of answers on how to control his werewolving ways. The story is predictable and a yawner, offering little in the way of furthering character development in an ancillary Buffy character - Oz. Equally dull is the artwork with little in the way of flair or panache to further stimulate visual interest. I'd recommend reading this only if you can come across a copy on the cheap or for the most hardcore Buffy/Oz fans. Otherwise they are plenty more worthwhile volumes in this series worth your coin and reading time."
2,"Danger. Duty, Disillusion, Sleepiness, and Obivious Facts","I took an Anthropology Course in the summer. I and the rest of my class were forced to read it. We were all bored out of our wits! However, the reason why i gave her two stars was: one, because it is a bit helpful for people who want to be officers of the law and the second star is because she did some 20 years of research, even though i could have wrote half of the book. Overall, i still would have bought it i guess but this book is not a ""shelf-emptier"" or a ""nail bitter"" but its ok buy it if you have extra money!!"
2,"Sample exams helpful, text is not always accurate","The sample exams are the most useful part of this book (and comprise almost half of the book). Less than 100 pages of the 340 pages are devoted to an overview of intro psych (about 50 pages deals w/ studying and test-taking which I did not find very useful). There is a glossary which is helpful. A good deal of the material in the sample exams does not appear in the text. Some of the text is wrong. E.g., p. 94 says that conservation and reversibility occur during Piaget's preoperational stage, which is wrong -- it happens in the concrete operations stage. I stumbled on this via one of the sample exams. The Cliff Notes _Quick Review Psychology_ has a lot more info in it, though it has some errors too."
5,JDylan420@aol.com,""". . .Valle draws his diverse influences to create music that is succinctly Latin, yet worldly in its themes and textures -- earthy, spiritual, soulful, and romantic. In song after song, without exception, he defies a typical guitarist's self-absorption and generously displays highs, lows and in-betweens. The emotions from Valle's guitar reach out seductively, sometimes forcefully, to encourage the listener to join his musical journey. On par with Valle's playing is his attention to cohesion and continuity."" --Gerald Poindexter SOUNDWAVES...CD REVIEWS"
5,Hey everybody let's twist!,"All the dance tunes he made famous from the sixties. You cannot go wrong with this CD. Only wish it had ""Lazy Elsie Molly"" on it to make it complete."
2,"nice songs, bad sound","Nice song, My favorite song from when I was 4 years old - Let's twist again- doesnt have the rithym and the pounch of the original, not pleased either with the remasterization."
2,"It's an ""Alienist"" starter kit!","With high hopes, I picked up this book, only to see them dropped into a grave for a premature burial. The author is clearly trying to capture the atmosphere present in Caleb Carr's ""The Alienist"" and ""Angel of Darkness"". However he fails due to the improbable friendship that develops between Poe and Crockett. Pass on this book, and go to the original master of detective stories, Poe himself."
1,Uh oh don't buy,"This is a book I bought with high hopes, none of which were fulfilled. It's boring, it's tedious, and a second class attempt at mirroring Poes style does nothing to make you want to finish it. Also, the constant allusions to Poe stories make you think ""oh no, not again"" pretty soon. A nice idea, but badly executed"
1,Unbearable,"Nice cover art, but oh, the writing! There's more to E.A. Poe than paranoia and a recherche vocabulary, but you'd never know it from Schechter's tiresome imitation of his style. The running gag of having off-kilter references to Poe's story (the ""House of Asher,"" a croaking seagull, a murdered old lady and ape-like suspect, Poe's curiosity about maelstroms, etc., ad nauseam) gets old really fast.Poor Poe wouldn't get far on ""Wheel of Fortune,"" either, judging from the number of times he misreads ""NEVERMORE"" with half the letters staring him in the face.Irritating, phony, and dull. Couldn't finish it."
3,ok,"when i ordered this product, 3 or 4 of them arrived broken. it was a christmas gift, so i ended up keeping the ones that were fully in tact, and ordering another set for the gift that i was planning because they were so nice. so i kept the incomplete set, which was unable to be completed by the seller, and purchased another set for the gift that i was planning. the glasses were very nice, but i was unhappy with the quality of the shipping."
2,Pretty but not comfortable to hold,"Pretty mugs, arrived unbroken, they hold EXACTLY 8 oz. the handle has ridged seams on both sides which makes it very uncomfortable to hold. I had to go down a size on my Keurig because my normal size would fit but I could not stir it after adding sweetener. I would not buy these again"
2,Another case of fake sweat...,"Well, old Ben K. should have stopped before this one! Nothing believable about it, just like the scenes on the racquet ball court with tee shirts having been squirted around the necks just before the action call...PUHLESE.Somebody will have to tell me what attracted Cruz to the older version of Mr. Clean except perhaps her appreciation of HIS appreciation of her. You can read about the plot, such as it was, somewhere else. Myself, I'll just shrug, say ""typical Roth"", and be very glad it was a Netflix rental quickly replaced in its red return envelope. Godspeed."
2,Not for the lay person.,I can't argue with any of the content of this book. I just found it impossible reading for the lay person interested in subject. For academics only!
1,very confusing book,"it seems like all the people reviewing this book has taken diffe at rice university, and no other universities have assigned this book. fortunately, i did not attend professor polking's section (i sat in on the first day and quickly switched sections). professor polking is a nice guy, and offers help when you need it (having said that, hopefully i won't feel so bad in my subsequent bashing). however, the book, like the second reviewer said, has very confusing proofs. the book is mostly just talk, and it's hard to tell what the key points (key equations) of each section are. it's also confusing because the sections aren't ""sectioned"" off--what leads to which key point? rather, it just seems to be one big blob of text, with the equations interspersed throughout. sure, buy it if it's required, but keep attend all lectures (if you are a college student) and keep another differential equations book handy, as you will undoubtedly not have a clue what polking is talking about."
4,Angelic?,"Easy read, puts you in a different space of time. Takes you on a journey of good and evil with twists and turns. I understand the sequel is finished and absolutely wonderful, is this true? Looking forward to many more reads by this imaginative author."
2,"Too busy, too overwhelming for a preschooler...",This book is way too busy for a 4-year old to follow. All the conversations in bubbles on each page are way too confusing for my son. I really wish I hadn't bought it. It would probably be okay for a 7 or 8-year old.
2,Not what's pictured,"The camisole came in a timely manner but is not the one pictured. The one pictured has a fleur de lis on the front and fancy lace and stitching around the arms. I received a plain,no name (there is literally no name on the tag in the back of the shirt) black tank."
1,i had sex with this guy,"what is ""Dirty History""? its the history of the ugliest, annoying crippled indian around. and hes back! this time he REALLY sucks. Especially since half the album has accoustic guitars on it, EWWWWWWWWWW!!!!! but then theres an appearance from some d12 members, which isnt smart because icp and esham hate D12 and Eminem! then theres this guys finger....where is it? he gotta stump! this guy was good as the Dixie Chicks hype man, but without country music, he sucks."
5,good,this is a good move to see it so kool you ill like this i like it very good bye it you will like it
3,Yikes!!!!!,If you can get yourself through the abuse both verbal and physical and of course rape than you stand a chance at a story with so much misunderstanding that will make your head spin. I gave it a 3 star rating because it did hold my interest and I believe was well written although I detested much of the harshness. Glad I didn't pay for it either.
4,Best of the velvets,"I've read all the books about the velvets and this one is the best!!I truely recommend it and it sure is a keeper too, I just love the Montgomery brothers and this one is just sooo good.You must read this one!"
1,domestic violence isn't romantic in any century,"a confusing concoction, comprised of detailed descriptions of silk and velvet garments trimmed with the fur of a variety of rodents, interspersed with scenes of rape, torture, beatings and unrequieted love enacted by characters whose motivation and actions are just plain Out There. Back to the library it goes. Fast."
1,He doesn't deserve her,"I had high hopes for this book, since it was listed on the reader's historical romance novel reading list. But Gavin Montgomery is a fool throughout the book, married to the strong, brave and beautiful Judith, while still pining away for mean, ugly (supposedly beautiful) Alice. It is overkill, and overshadows and ruins the romance. I ended up hoping she would hook up with another man! He doesn't deserve her!"
1,I hated it!,"The characters are horrible as is the plot. It made me so frustrated, pissed, and filled with white hot rage that I wanted to jump into the book and slap each and every single character. Especially the ""hero"" (if you can call him that at all. Arrogant disgusting douche is more like it!) and that annoying maid! I love her other books (my new fav is the edilean books) and I know she can do better!"
1,Waste of money,"I guess I have to face it - Metabolife is gone! It worked, this does not. I started with 2 pills, then 3, added Hoodia, then 4 pills; still nothing! Thank goodness I had a gift certificate and did not spend my own money! I'm through wasting money on diet pills! (Haven't I heard that before?)"
1,SCAM!!!!!!!!! DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a scam, don't purchase this item. I bought this and didn't lose not even a pound. If you want to lose weight, you'll have to do it the hard way- diet and exercise. Sorry!"
4,"so far, so good","I've been using this product for 4 days. I've been taking half the recommended dose, Just 3 pills midafternoon because I don't eat breakfast, and I've already lost 3 pounds. My metabolism isn't extra fast. I'm not working out, I'm not starving myself. I'm eating right after I take the pills. I'm drinking a lot of water (which i do anyways, NO SODA!)and I'm eating when I'm hungry. Now, before you claim my loss as water weight, my weight before was a consistant 130. And I've lost 3 pounds and weighed myself 3 different times throughout the day to make sure of it. The only thing I don't like is that it makes my heart beat a little faster than I'm used to. At least I'm not taking naps during the day anymore!"
1,Don't waste your money/time,"I can't understand why in some websites this product is rated #1 over thousands more for losing weight. The truth in my case is that it didn't work, it didn't do anything, I bought it thinking it would be a great complemment for my low carb diet, thinking that i might be able to lose more weight... I was wrong. Don't waste your money, the product is not cheap."
3,I lose weight with this,I lose 34 pounds so far and it doesn't make me have nervous or anxiety. I like the energy it gives me for exercises. I do yoga and Tai-Chi for strength this Lipovarn does not interfere with my sleep and it make my appetite decrease. I hope the weight I have lost stays off this time. I am older now and it is very hart to lose weight and keep off. I like the way lipovarn has helped me.
4,Ending is enough to make you retch!,"This book was very engrossing from the start. It was a colorful and beautiful story. I could not wait for Brunahild and Sigfrid to meet. Yet I was anticipating a beautiful love story. A lovely romance. They didn't fall in love, they fell in lust. That scene at the end was of desire, not true love. It disgusted me! Still, if you are able to brace yourself, read the novel. It is worth the read."
4,holy monkey foot this parts hard!,"I'm 11 and my sister just got this game for easter she really liked this game until she got to planet ""bowlorama"", she said that the game was way to hard for her and that she needed help so I said I would help and thought it would be a snap. But when I started playing I realized This game was not rated for the right age group witch was5-8, and I really think that the next time they make another game to rate it differently.But other than that I do think she really enjoyed this game so she raited it a 4."
4,High level music for all standards,"This is flower kings at their usual high standard. Overall the CD is very atmospheric, being their most movie-like music to date. It contains what maybe their best Instrumental to date: Retropolis. This song itself is a masterpiece that alone makes this CD worthwhile. Beautiful!"
4,Question about track 6,Can anyone tell me what happens about 3:08 of track 6 on Retropolis? Is this cracking up sound a recording blunder or wierd sounds added by the Flowerkings? Please let me know your thoughts.
3,"Uncomfortable, But True To Life","The acting in this film was amazing. I was really impressed with C.Thomas Howell. HOwever, I was so uncomfortable watching this movie because it is brutally realisitc. I guess that was the point, to how how cruel those two men (if you can call them men), were. Although it was good, I would have liked to see more of the actual trial and incarceration. The film focused directly on their acts the entire time, which is hard to watch."
4,MR. HILLTOP. REVIEW IN MY WORDS.,"I,AM NOT GOING INTO DETAIL ON THIS MOVIE, I ONLY PURCHASED THIS, BECAUSE I ENJOYFILMS ON THE SUBJECT OF TRUE CRIME. THE REVIEW ON THIS MOVIE IS - VERY STRONG SUBJECT MATTERWITH VIOLENT NUDITY PARTS, VARIOUS KILLING MOMENTS BY TWO MEN AND SUPER STRONG X-RATED USE OF LANGUAGE.MY RATE - 3 STARES. TO MU8CH OFA FILM FOR MY SELF."
2,cheapo price and cheapo video quality,"this is adequate if you use it indoors to take pictures of baby's first steps but you cannot see the display outdoors at all. the video quality is barely acceptable, battery life is terrible, sound is adequate. i bought one at amazon for 129 then found walmart has it for 99. amazon does NOT price match or guarantee lowest price, so i paid 30 bucks too much for a 99 buck toy"
5,Can be watched many times over,I'm a big Otis Redding fan. The Monteray Pop footage is excellent. The European tour footage is very bad visually but excellent vintage footage. I highly recommend it Otis Redding fans.
3,Important Product to me,I truly enjoy this product in exfoliating my skin. What I hate about it is that the content is too small. If I ever found one that worked as well with more content I would switch in a minute. It is the best I've ever used.
5,Doomy Death That Will Blacken Your Soul.,"Incantation have always been like the possessed son of Immolation to me. This band has come a long way from the Golgotha days. This album had the same kind of feel to it as Infernal Storm. I think the songs were better though. Merciless Tyranny is proof that these guys are growing more into the technical realm of Death Metal. Not technical like Cryptopsy or Nile. Not that extreme. But with the doom soaked riffs these guys can lay down right in the middle of a fast tune and still make it all come out killer in the end ... man, they just really progressed. Still sound evil as hell, killer tunes to light one up to, easy 5 stars for Incantation on this one. If you liked Infernal Storm, grab this!"
4,"It's great to see some funny, clean comedy!",We enjoyed both this and the first in the series. I hope they make a third!
3,Eh...Okay...the 1st one Rocked!,"I can't say I'd recommend this 2nd DVD. The first one was awesome, but this one we only watched once and barely laughed. The first DVD, we've watched dozens of times and still split our sides laughing!!! So, buy the first, pass up the second!"
1,"Buy the original ""Thou Shalt Laugh"" instead","This is not nearly as good as the first or original ""Thou Shalt Laugh"". I rate this one with only one star. I give the original 5 stars. I didn't want the original to end and I have watched the original several times. I won't watch this one again. It just wasn't as funny.Take my advice. You won't be disappointed with the original."
3,Still Holdin' Faith Biz,"Now I have been down with every memebr of Bone since Creepin' and been open to the solo projects they dropped. Bizzy had me lookin forward to Alpha & Omega when he dropped Hollywood on the True Crime soundtrack, and even though it's sad to say he dropped the ball a little I still respected his lyrics but what upset me is the same thing with this album the production value. It's like he dropped a dime bag on his cousin to record this album on his Dell. But there are some gems in here like, T.T, Seeing Things, Hold Me Down, Carry My Baby and BB da Thug.But Bizzy really lost me on Shake Ya Stick in the intro he's talkin about Shake ya stick when the f**gots try to lust your body (making like he's talking to his son) then goes into talking about a strip club....????????? huh?Anyway it's good to see Biz creepin back."
3,Roselynde,"Although the story line was interesting, the book itself was ponderous. It dealt with the reign of Richard the Lion heart and the machinations of Queen Alinor, prince John and others in the royal household in so many minute details, that the love story between the queen's namesake Alinore and the knight sir Simon was almost lost. Many details didn't add to the story. In describing the embarkation, it was unnecessary that we know that a servant jumped and was crushed. It took several pages to describe events which should have taken a half page. I found myself skipping pages. It began to seem like a history textbook."
2,Roselynde,"I could not get into the book, too much language that is not of this english language. I just thought it was rather boring and will not continue with it until the end."
2,"Don't waste your time,","I read this thinking I'd like it of course but I really had a problem getting into this book, sometimes I think authors try to hard, I hate to say Boring, but I like alittle more excitement."
5,This tale has stood the test of time,"I first read this book when it was released in the '70s, and my 30-year-old copy of the book is in tatters from numerous re-reads. Ms. Gellis is a consummate storyteller -- medieval English history of the 1200s come alive under her spell. Gellis is the only reason I remember as much English history as I do! ""Roselynde"" introduces us to Alinor, who has recently inherited a very large estate on the coast of England called Roselynde. Because she is a very young heiress, she is brought to court by Queen Alinor (or Eleanor of Aquitaine, as many of us remember her) to protect her from fortune hunters and opportunists. At court, she enters into a world of political intrigue leading up to the Third Crusade, and finds herself falling in love with a most unlikely man: her guardian, or warden, Simon. She must adroitly manage the wishes of kings, queens and politics in order to manage her own heart's desire."
3,"Not bad, but not great.","Short and simple, it's a fan, it moves air and it does a good job doing it. Over all I'm happy with it. The only issue I have is that it's really loud. I bought this to use at work and it was just so loud I couldn't hear on the phone. Maybe it's just the one I got though; maybe I got a bad one or something. So I just took it home and I use it there, who cares how loud it is when I'm sitting at my workbench in the garage. It cools me off and that's all that matters."
5,Album of the Year,"I can't imagine a better album coming out this year. Joe has written songs that not only make you feel good just by hearing them, he's written songs that you continue to hear after the final note has faded, and I mean that in the best possible sense.From the opening chords of ""There Goes The Sun"", you'll realize you are listening to a pop music (again, I mean that in the best possible sense) genius at the top of his game.Joe's delicate voice is the perfect delivery system for his lyrics. Full of hope, angst and everything in between, Discover a Lovelier You may not help you do exactly that, but it will most certainly put you on the path of discovering the loveliest record of 2005."
4,Back in the saddle,"I, for one, was not a fan of Y,M&O...I; felt that Joe's songwriting muse had failed him for that one. Too studiedly literate song lyrics that sounded like an overcaffeinated grad student trying overly hard to impress his advisor...the melodies, too, were too overwrought, crossing the line from melodic into syrup-y.But here, Joe gets his mojo back quite a bit. He's reined the lyrics and melodies in, to the point where they're merely catchy, not gloopy...Oddly enough though, I think my favorite track is the instrumental...go figure.Having said all the above, this still ranks behind their best ""Overcome by happiness"" and ""World without end"" (numbers 1 and 2, in terms of quality for me, respectively)."
4,Awesome Forensics Again!,"Ms. Reichs books are wonderful because they are full of forensic information. Her knowledge of anthropological forensics is extensive and she puts a lot of it in books, but in a way that is interesting for the layman. I liked this book better than her last one that was set in Guatemala. In this Tempe is doing her thing in Charlotte. We also get to see more of Ryan and Tempe's relationship with him does pick up a notch. The book starts out very strong with Tempe examining the burned bones of a newborn. From there we go to drug tafficking and the illegal sale of animal parts. There are a number of seemingly unrelated incidents (and bodies) that clutter up Tempe's table, but it turns out they are all related in one way or another. That's where I feel the book falls down somewhat because of the incredible coincidences that keep happening, and the ending is rushed and disjointed. Still it's an excellent read and there's lots of excitement and a little romance too."
4,Another great Tempe Brennan mystery,"Tempe is back home in Charlotte. She is planning a much needed vacation with the man of her dreams. At the same time, her daughter Katy, is introducing her to her new boyfriend. Unfortunately, one thing leads to another, and Tempe finds herself thrown into a case involving bones, dead animals, birds, a missing family and a dead infant. As usual, Tempe cannot seperate work and her private life, and the case takes Tempe and the reader from one point to another. Sometimes there are too many characters and too many loose ends, and that is why this book does not get 5 stars. The book is well written and the plot is good, and it was a very fast read, that just kept going. Without knowing the other Tempe Brennan books, it may be a bit of a disappointing read, and it is definitely not Kathy Reich's best, but it is still worth reading and highly recommendable to anybody who like a good mystery!"
4,"Grim, Read Mad Light by Maddox","The one and most annoying characteristic of this are the details and excess personalities that do get confusing mixture. I think Kathy became unintentionally grounded in gruesome detail. The storyline however is super and direction is intelligent. I believe she simply over wrote this one. refer to Maddox's Book, Mad Light."
2,A Disappointment,"This book is categorized as a suspense-thriller, which is interesting because it contains barely any suspense and hardly any thrills. You'd have to read the entire book to realize this, however, so not a lot of people would catch the stunning lack of suspense and thrills and the inaccuracy of it being placed in the wrong category.I've heard a great deal of praise for Reichs' first novel, Deja Dead, and in retrospect I wish I had read it instead of this one because it sounds like it at least belongs in the suspense/thriller genre whereas this one is not even worthy of praise.If you don't like to get excited, or if your doctor has suggested you should lay off all excitement for a while, then THIS is your kind of book."
2,Not Up to Par,"Reichs usually writes a really good thriller, but this one falls absolutely flat. One feels like she dashed it off in a great hurry to meet a deadline and never got chance to revise her first draft. The characters are not well delineated and it is difficult for the reader to remember who is who [or to care] and the plot did not engage me at all. Even the romantic angle of the novel fell flat - it felt forced, not spontaneous. Normally I really look forward to Reichs' novels, but this one I could easily have skipped and not have minded a whit. Don't bother unless you like being bored."
2,Too Long and Drawn Out,"This is my first Kathy Reichs novel, and my last! It started off really good, but quickly turned into a lot of crap that took forever to get through. She added too much technical jargon, and forgot the KISS philosophy. I had to suffer through it since I paid my money for it, but I know better next time."
1,Bare Bones,"I anxiously waited in line, my heart racing, at my local book store. Bare Bones by Kathy Reichs was finally being put on the shelves and I was there to get my copy!Escounced in my favorite chair, I shut the world out and opened that first page. By the time I had read the last page and slowly closed the book, I thought to myself, ""This can't be a Kathy Reichs' book; this is awful!"" I felt like I had been cheated."
2,I'd only finish this if I were being graded on it.,"I gave up on this book five chapters in. If I wanted to read a slow compilation of quotes from other literature about the history of coal, I'd have purchased a textbook.I can only recommend this to people who have papers to write on this very subject as a shortcut to finding original sources.The bibliography received one of the stars in this review."
2,Typical for Blue Moon series...,"A lot of sex but very shallow story ... The editorial review talks of hedonism in Tokyo but this could really have taken place in Hialeah, Florida for all the time taken by the author to get into the oriental culture. I can get more of a taste for oriental eroticism by just eating sushi for goodness sakes ..."
5,Parapsychology De-Mystified,"This is a great novel that de-mystifies the parapsychology profession. The parapsychologist-heroine is not a character out of Ghostbusters, but is instead a three dimensional character that deals with everyday challenges while persuing her interest in the paranormal. Real psi research is woven into the plot and makes it even more enjoyable. I am hoping for a sequel."
4,"Good CD-R, but nothing beats JVC / Taiyo Yuden","This is a good CD-R, but nothing beats JVC's gold top 74 minute CD-Rs. This disc plays in the majority of my CD players, but it fails on some older ones which can play the JVC perfectly. I do like that it has a protective surface above the reflective layer. JVC's normal CD-Rs don't have this, but the gold top ones do."
2,Not Feeling It,"I read this book with high expectations. I ended up being disappointed.While it is a work of fiction, I still found it to be overly unrealistic and hard to relate to any of the characters - especially the main character.It is a page-turner and can keep you interested. However, as a literary work and a story, I don't think it really has the glue to stick to anything."
2,Over-rated,"Overcome by the hype, and the fact that The Kite Runner was on the NYT's best seller list for so long, I started reading it. I must admit, I really enjoyed the first few chapters. I found the book was well-written, and the characters were clearly developed. What I particularly found interesting was the description of Afghanistan prior to the Soviet invasion. But about a quarter way through the book, the plot started becoming predictable and the prose started wearing thin. I was also becoming confused. I wasn't quite sure what statements the author was trying to make. Perhaps the book was longer than it should have been. Why was it successful? Maybe its success is a result of the politics the book represents rather than its value as fiction. In closing, it reminded me of the types of novels we had to read in high school English classes."
3,Am I the only one who had difficulty liking Amir?,"While I understand that the traumatic event that shapes Amir's life happened when he was 12 years old, I had trouble empathizing with him once he became an adult and failed to try and contact Hassan, who was such a friend to him. The real problem I had was when something was asked of him that could help reconcile the past, he at first refuses, and when he finally comes through, it still takes him a while to do the right thing. I would recommend this book however, because it has stayed with me much longer than a book normally would."
5,I loved it!,"I think this is one of the best books I've read in my entire lifetime, that is including [...]. I have an eclectic taste for books. And this one hit me hard. Hassan is a beautiful character, in fact so beautiful that you feel guilty for having ever been alive a day next to someone so flat out perfect. But beyond the sense of place, THE KITE RUNNER features very well drawn characters. There are the ""hero"" figures of Amir, Hassan and Baba, but also secondary characters like Rahim Kahn, the General and Assef, who provide a complete picture of the various personalities and backgrounds that combined to create Afghan society today. I also enjoyed the depictions of the Afghan emigre community in California, as these snapshots gave me a sense of the immigrant experience and the conflicts that are present when one leaves one homeland to adopt another."
2,And a couple more thing about how schlocky this book is . . .,"Most of what I would say about this book has already been covered by other reviewers giving two stars or less, but having slogged my way to the end of this hopelessly overrated book, I'm adding my two cents.Cliche? Yes. Predictable? Always. A portrait of Afghanastan? I have not been there or even read much about it, but I have a hard time swallowing the story that your average Taliban is a religious hypocrite, a pedophilic rapist, AND a savage killer.The characters are like cardboard cutouts: thin, unrealistic, and often reused in slightly varying forms. If this is great writing, I better stop throwing away those pamphlets the Jehovah's Witnesses keep giving me."
1,Shameful,"After the poor boy called Hassan was raped by other ""racist"" boys, I finally stopped reading after 10 more painful pages of the book. It had become obvious that the rest of the book would be about that.I was excited to read this book because finally a Muslim (by name only??) wrote a Best seller about a predominately Muslim country and what a shame and disappointment it turned out that he would devote so much of his time to such a shameful plot.Unfortunately, I already bought Khaled's other book called Thousand Splendid Suns, but I am so disappointed with this one, I am contempating throwing the second book in the gabage before even opening the first page. And if you guessed rightly, yes, this one named The Kite Runner is going into our gabage bin! Not even worth recycling!!"
4,The Kite Runner,"I really did enjoy this book. I didn't give it 5 stars, because I didn't like the ending. BUT... it sure keep my attention! I wanted to lay in bed all day and read this great novel. I will read more of this author's work."
2,Total chick book,"Don't read this if you usually read Ludlum, Clancy, DeMille etc. I read it on a reccomendation from a female friend. I found my self wanting to smack the narrating wimpy subject of the story, and waiting to almost no avail for when he was finally going to find his courage. Anti-climactic as well."
4,"A poignant, gripping tale","A haunting story of guilt and redemption, set amidst the backdrop of a harsh but beautiful land. The plot never slows down, sustaining its tempo from start to finish, leading us through the twists and turns, but never appearing forced. Characters come alive wonderfully under the author's deft touch. However, I felt let down by the climax which in my opinion had a surfeit of sentimentality and melodrama. In spite of that, I rate this a definite ""must read."""
4,"Haunting portrayal of Afghanastan, but weak in some areas","This book gives a poignant and haunting look at one boy's youth in Afghanastan, showing the disparity among people in the class system. The book for me, falls apart a bit in the middle, when he moves to the U.S. - it just loses some of its luster and vivid imagery. Overall though, a thought provoking, emotional book."
2,"Interesting background on life in Afghanistan; hokey, melodramatic plot","The title of this review pretty much sums up where I stand. If you can borrow a copy, it's worth beginning this book. I very much enjoyed the back story, with its details of day-to-day life in Afghanistan in the 1970s and 1980s, before and after the Soviet invasion. I might be willing to read more non-fiction from Hosseini, but the man is no novelist. The plot is pure soap opera and gets more and more implausible (and irritating) as the book proceeds."
2,Exceptionally contrived........,"I don't know why this book has received such high marks. To begin, the whole plot is so contrived I could barely finish reading it. Additionally, layering coincidence on top of coincidence, as the author does, left me with this ""you've got to be kidding"" feeling. The characters are, on the whole, unlikeable, and the ""bad guy"", is so ""over the top"" bad that it is down right laughable. Really, who gave this stuff 5 stars. If you did, please email me a list of books you've loved and I'll be sure to stay away from them."
5,Truly Awesome,This was one of the best novels I've read in years. The book provides an excellent and thoughtful portrait of Afghanistan before and during the rule of the Taliban. Well written and intelligent; a must read.
4,Avoid the cliches!,"First, I found this story moving (crying by page 50) and culturally interesting. All I know of Afghanistan I learned from the post-9/11 evening news and the movie ""Osama"". In many ways, this novel is similar to that movie. It gives the impression that nothing good can happen in Afghanistan, that it is a depressed country full of misfortune. The pre-Taliban portions of this novel are rich with detail. Once Amir moves to the US, the story morphs into the trite ""immigrant makes good"" story with melodramatic plot twists. I expected more from Amir's return to his native country. Many of the descriptions are cliched and weak. Regardless of the weaknesses in plot and imagery, a fabulous first effort!"
1,Cheap Tricks,"This is 2.5 star book. I gave it a 1 to balance out the disproportionate share of 5 star reviews.After all I had heard about this book, it was a big disappointment. I would not recommend anyone read this book, there are many better books to be read.I enjoyed having a pictures of Afghanistan and Pakistan, countries I know little about. The story is engaging and moves quickly. If it were a journal, I would find it improbable, but like it more. As fiction, its full of ""cheap tricks"" : gratuitous violence, rape, pedophilia, and other plot divices to titilate the masses. The story also has many improbable ridiculous coincidences.The fact that is is set in Afghanistan and is anti Taliban I am sure goes a long way to giving it the 5 star reviews and press it received."
3,"Good, but has a weak spot","I liked this book--until the storyline picks up again years later, about 2/3 of the way through. Until then, the characters kept me engaged. I particularly cared about the children in this book. But the book should have ended there. Instead, it reads as if the writer's editor or agent told him it has to be longer so he tagged on this long passage that really doesn't make the story anymore meaningful or interesting."
2,Falls apart 3/4 way through,"Due to incessant hype and a friend's recommendation, I read the book. At first I found it a compelling read - especially descriptions of Afghanistan before the Russians, and the inter-relationships betweent he narrator and his boyhood friend, family, his transition to living in the States, etc. BUT - when the narrator returns to Afghanistan, the story loses all credibility. The plot becomes an overwrought and turgid soap opera, full of eye-rolling coincidences and a cheesy villan out of a silent movie. Like a bad Hollywood script, into which I'm sure it's already being developed.It went from being a book I couldn't stop reading to a book I didn't want to finish. It's mindless popularity and critical accolades says more about the sorry state of American fiction and publishing than the sorry state of Afghanistan."
2,A contrived soap opera set in a fascinating culture.,"The Kite Runner has some admirable features; however, compelling story-telling is not one of them. The descriptions of Afgan culture and society, before, during, and after the Taliban, are the novel's only redeeming features. The story line reads like it was written by a bright high school student. It uses the worst, most transparent plot devices and cliches. I laughed out loud at several of the most predictable points in the book, and believe me, this is no comedy. I think that too many of the reviewers here are being generous because of the very worthwhile descriptions of Afgan culture, one that we Americans ought to know a lot more about than we do. As a work of literary art, this book fails in some very obvious and compelling ways. No committed reader of fiction could take the plot seriously, but it still might be worth your time if only for the cultural dimension alone."
5,A read that touches heart and soul and mind,I found this book being so emotionally engaging that I had to stop reading it to take a breath from time to time. The prose and the plot and the characters - everything came out brilliantly. Bravo to the author. Awesome book!
5,Kite Runner runs away with my affection,".....great read. seemed like the pages just flew by. took me a while to get into it but then i couldn't put it down. also read, ""Ten Thousand Splendid Suns"" by the same author, Hosseini which is great, as well. Both books made me want to read more about Afghanistan."
5,exhilarating,"I found this book to be not only an extremely well written story about family and class dynamics, but also an important statement politically. I didn't realize so much about the Afghan culture, and the horrific atrocities the people there have endured. Definitely a perspective every American should hear!"
4,The Kite Runner,"Enlightening book re a different culture and country; easy to read. Disturbing that it is so accurate relating to human nature, behaviour and beliefs."
4,Very touching and exciting,"I love this story by Hosseini. The plot is exciting, with intermittent slower moments of touching developments. You really come away with a feeling of concern for the children of Afghanistan."
4,great read!,"Keep in mind that I'm ADD so it takes a lot for a book to keep my attention...that being said...simply put, this book is wonderful!There were parts in the book that seemed to drag on a bit. but overall, there were many things that kept me interested. There were even parts of the book that made my heart stop. It was that good!There are also a lot of great quotes which make you think. I really enjoyed the glimpse into afghani culture that this book provided."
5,Read this Book,"I finished it weeks ago and find myself still relishing Hosseini's talent.I have recommended it to everyone I know and would be remiss if I didn't endorse this beautifuly ,haunting book in a public forum. A long-needed inside look at Afganistan that reader's immediately embrace, opposed to dry,crumbling political non-fictions. Bravo Khaled Hosseini! Next summer is too long to wait!"
2,Overated and underwritten,"I read this book after so many of my friends insisted it was the their best read this year. What a disappointment. The simplistic and shallow characters follow a horribly contrived plot with the seeming goal of manhandling your emotional state into one of forced sympathy for a protagonist you never liked anyway! The narrator frequently mentions how bad it is to use cliches, but this book is chock full of them. Don't feel bad about skipping this one."
2,What an overrated book,"Let me put it this way: If Stephen King or Deane Koontz decided to write a suspense/horror novel set in Afghanistan with an all-Afghan cast of characters and really did their homework on Afghan language and culture, the end result probably would not look too different from _The Kite Runner_. There's nothing wrong with that; I like a good suspense thriller as much as the next guy. But I expected a somewhat higher form of literature with this book and was disappointed. I guess one man's Pulitzer Prize material is another man's pulp fiction."
5,kite runner,The Kite RunnerKite runner was one of the best book I ever read about Afghanistan. I Felt the book. I can't wait for the Movie.
5,Great Book!!!,I absolutely LOVED this book. Had trouble putting it down when I had to do something else... like sleep! Found I was almost holding my breath at times as the suspense mounted in parts of the storyline.
4,Gripping book,"An excellent book about the relationship that Amir has with his father and tries so hard to please him, about his best friend and servant Hassan and them growing up in Afganistan before the wars, about friendship, loss and emigrating to the US. Then Amir needs to go back and experience the war torn destroyed country. A fascinating read and small insight to Afghan life."
5,Fantastic,"It starts with the first line. And the wondering, curiosity, and suspense don't let up until the last word. This is fantastic story telling.Sandra Glahn, Lethal Harvest"
3,"Great story, but...","I started reading this book with high expectations from all the hype. The story is good, but it's clear it's the writer's first book--no beginner's slam dunk, which I guess I expected from all the praise it was getting and was let down. The second half was more exciting to me, and I almost wished he had condensed the first half, or incorporated it into backstory and expanded on the second half. Don't want to give away the ending, but expect a great story that gives insight into Afghanistan's rich culture, but a writing structure that isn't as tight and well paced as other books written by more established writers. Nothing wrong with it--everyone has to start somewhere, but this is a book where it's the boldness of the story that captured everyone's attention."
4,Good read.,"While I thoroughly enjoyed this story, I found the book a little far-fetched towrds the end. But, I guess that is why it is a work of fiction. I still recommend the book."
5,A book you will remember,Some books you read and then forget. This book you will read and remember. A great book!
5,a phenomenal book,"This is a fabulous story, beautifully written and well conceived. The characters are ones which stay with you. I liked it as much as East of Eden by John Steinbeck, one of my all time favorites. Why didn't think book win the pulizer prize or a booker prize? Go figure."
5,This is literature,"Upon completing ""The Kite Runner,"" I was astonished by the breadth of what Hosseini has accomplished. Not only is the book an engaging, engrossing narrative and an incomparable insight into Afghan culture, but it is also a truly literary masterpiece. Its only fault is its seemingly improbable coincidences - but Hosseini even addresses this ""Plot Hole"" with his aside of how what seems unlikely to the rest of the world is quite common in Afghanistan. Hosseini identifies so perfectly with his narrator that it is frequently difficult to distinguish between personal experience and fiction. His prose is simple but expressive, in keeping with the book's message. I will surely read ""The Kite Runner"" again, so I can better appreciate Hosseini's subtle nuances while not thirsting desperately for the outcome."
4,I couldn't stop reading this . .,"The book was incredibly compelling. I really couldn't put it down, but then I hated myself for it later. I kept on waiting and waiting for something good to happen to the deserving characters. . . and it never happened. I was literally sobbing by at times and kept reading thinking that it would somehow work out in the end. But NO! There is no redemption!! This book left me feeling awful because all he got was a smile in the end. And he's right, it didn't make anything better or fix a thing. It just left me in tears (not happy tears)."
5,"Excellent, heart felt, a human tale of compassion!","This book has it all! Compassion, cowardice, love, honor, betrayal, and redemption. The scenes in the book are easily visualized thanks to Hosseini's beautiful descriptive style. This is a novel that truly touches the soul. I could not put it down. ENJOY!"
5,Fabulous,"I loved the KITE RUNNER. Aside from a gripping and personal story, Mr. Hosseini paints a vivid picture of life in Afghanistan during Zahir Shah in the 1970s, the Communists and with the Taliban. It is filled with a rich collage of the daily life of a wealthy family in pre-Communist Afghanistan, rarely seen in English language books. Particularly sensitive was the handling of two generations of immigrants uprooted from a life of wealth and affluence in Afghanistan to the realities of the West. But most poignant was the rendering of a Pashtun ""Mard"" (real man) in the characterization of Baba, Amir's father, and even more so that of Hassan, his Hazara servant. Fabulous"
5,heart wrenching from start to finish,"with so many glowing reviews there isnt much left to say. As a mother my heart went out to both Amir and his Father - their complex relationship(s), family secrets, the horror of war. With all we know about Afghanistan, the Taliban et al... this wonderfuly book puts real faces and real feelings to real people. Anyone who doubts the US should have invaded the country read this and think again! Anyone who dislikes immigrants and cant understand why they cant just 'fit in' should also read it.At times it reminded me of House of Sand and Fog - a timely reminer that we make too many assumptions without knowing peoples real stories. I am still talking about this book many weeks later."
5,You will not be able to stop reading till you finish the book,This is an incredible book about the life of a little Afgan boy. It takes the reader to life in Afganistan during times of before and after Russian occupation and the Taliban regime. The book is very vivid and sufficiently descriptive without losing the momentum of the plot. The author is soo convincing that you will never forget the story. The story leaves what I could call an aftertaste that you will probably wish to lose by finding another book that is as gripping.
4,The Kite Runner,"When I decided to read The Kite Runner, I was slightly hesitant. A lot of times when things are more popular, they have trouble living up to their expectations. This wasn't the case with The Kite Runner though. This book was fast paced and hard to put down, which nearly equals a great book. The story shows the main character, Amir, grow up and develop. It's over the course of a good portion of his life, which means a lot happens in the book.The only part I didn't like was something that happened near the end with Sohrab. If you've read the book, you probably know what I'm talking about. I felt like it was unrealistic and not needed for the plot to work out how it did. Besides that, I liked the rest of the book. I would recommend this book to mostly anyone, because it has a lot of general themes in it and most people will be able to find some way to relate to it."
3,"Good start, lesser finish, greatly overrated","The first half is outstanding and very realistic, the second half is disappointing. Reviewers have greatly overrated this book; I doubt it will remain on anyone's top reading list a few years from now. Hosseini seems to know less about immigration to the United States than just about any immigrant. His portraits of Taliban bad guys are B movie grade and not very credible."
3,Discrediting Islamic practicing,"As a novel, it is impressing. Full of sensation. Very well explaining children's world. Meanwhile, criticizing roughly Afghan culture and some Islamic practising. Never say anything invasion of United States and its massacring in the country."
4,Kite Runner,The book was in great shape and it was received in excellent shape. The pages were all in good shape and clean. This book was for a birthday present and she didn't even realize it was a used book. I am extremely pleased with the book and the seller and will use them again.
2,Staggeringly obvious and trite.,"I heard so much about this book that maybe I expected too much. There are no likeable charachters, and the ones that are supposed to be likeable come off as oddly Christlike and unreal.The plot twists are obvious and expected-- totally forced. Actually, for a book this long, there isn't really that much of a plot. The writing is good, although not particularly lyrical or creative.Without revealing too much, I would agree with the reviewer who mentioned that this has all the markings of a Hallmark movie. It really seems contsructed that way. As well, Afganistan is not vividly portrayed enough, IMHO, and if this book were set somewhere else with the same level of writing I don't think it would have achieved the same level of acclaim.If you are interested in Afganistan do yourself a favor and read some non-fiction-- this book really wasn't ""it"", and it was WAY too manipulative.Rachel"
5,An Astonishing Novel,"The Kite Runner is a spellbinding tale of a young boy's struggle from childhood to adulthood and the things he must conquer along the way. It begins with Amir, a privileged young boy living in Afghanistan. The storyline follows his transition from boyhood to manhood through a number of heart wrenching events that most people could not even begin to fathom.This novel goes beyond the cold politics of Afghanistan and delves deeper into the true emotions felt by the Afghani society. It shows the people behind the news headlines that are sometimes overlooked. These people have lives. They have fortunes. They have families. Now we have a remarkable book to portray those things."
5,reader,The Kite Runner is one of the most well written novels out there. It's full of emotions and it makes you want to keep reading it. I could relate to the characters and all the experiences they had in their lives. I loved how the author used farsi in putting his thoughts accross. Very well done!
3,it's just too contrived!,"I thought that the most powerful part of the book was the middle section, Amir in America. The first part was also pretty good. The story telling is vivid, the action well-paced, and the book is EXTREMELY emotionally intense, at times almost painful to keep reading. Hosseini has a gift for foreshadowing that is excellent- enough to help you figure it out but not enough to give it away. However, once Amir returns to Afghanistan, the plot becomes filled with ridiculous soap opera revelations and deus ex machine that are just ridiculous, especially in their symbolic value. I loved reading this book, but the characters are essentially cartoon characters, each one of them brightly and blaringly crafted into a stereotype with no depth whatsoever- Amir the shy and bookish aristocrat, Hassan the smiling loyal servant, Baba the gruff unloving father....it's a good book, but the sentiment is just too overpowering."
5,Devoured this book in hours,I absolutely loved this book. It was heart wrenching at times and very moving. A must read.
4,Disturbing,"This is truly a disturbing book. When I say a book is disturbing, that means it is written so well that the reader gets caught up in the emotion of the text, and the emotion continues far past the last page. It was also quite educational. The ""Taliban"" used to just be a word I heard bantered about in the news. It is now real.The narrator, speaking in the first person, is so easy to hate throughout most of the book, a very clever literary device. Loyalty never was presented with such beauty and such horror."
3,Destined for Hollywood,"Other reviewers have described the qualities of this book well; it is emotionally gripping, written in a pleasing, readable style, and the subject of Afghanistan is, as the narrator himself says, of great interest today. However, the story rather loses steam as Amir leaves Afghanistan, and the final conclusion seems hurried. Moreover, the author exploits parallelism too far, and rather than using this technique to create a satisfying plot, the technique itself is obvious to the reader. (While Sohrab's revenge struck me as too neat a plot twist, Amir's split lip just left me groaning.)The story is good, but suffered a bit from the writing, which I believe will prevent it from becoming great literature. Basically, the slightly artificial plot is just waiting for a Hollywood screenwriter."
4,A very worthwhile and absorbing book,"My daughter had to read The Kite Runner for high school summer reading. She went in her room with it, and basically didn't come out until she had finished it, saying ""Mom, you HAVE to read this book!""So I did, and I was as absorbed with it as she was. The portrayals of Afghanistan in the 1960s, the Afghani diaspora in Northern California, and Afghanistan today bring a human reality to the news.The story is very well crafted, and the characters multidimensional. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because of slightly awkward writing in spots. Since this is Khaled Hosseini's first published novel, that's more than forgiveable. I look forward to reading more from this writer."
4,"A Memorable, and Excellent Book!","The Kite Runner is one of the most memorial stories that I have read this year. There is everything all wrapped up into this story about a family living in Afghanistan..I found forgiveness, betrayal, plus a better understanding of the culture, customs of this country. The story is filled with a bold writing style about love and truth and unforgettable characters. Mr. Khaled Hosseini created an excellent tale that is set against the backdrop of political turbulence that has destroyed the lives of so many people in this country. With the author's prose I was able to see and understand what has happened to these unfortunate people. Overall, this is a wonderful novel and I believe that it will touch your heart deeply."
5,a masterpiece!!!,"one of the truly great reads in a very long time. since i purchased it, i have reread it three times and bought copies for all my friends, whohave all called to say how much they like it."
5,Haunting and Lyrical,"What a wonderful book! It proves that human emotions such as love, loss, betrayal, and hope are timeless and can be found anywhere, regardless of class or culture. This is a story that has stayed with me long after I finished it."
2,soap opera novel,"Although I enjoyed the first half of the book and it's poignant way of introducing the reader to Afghani culture, the second half left me feeling like I was reading some trashy romance novel. Once the main character left Afghanistan, things were way too convenient, coincidental and contrived."
3,A great read spoiled,"In the few days it took me to read this book, I didn't want to put it down, and couldn't stop raving about it whenever I did. On putting it down after having read the last page, and after a short amount of time to absorb what I had read, the word that kept coming to mind was ""manipulated"". Too neatly wrapped up, too many improbable coincidences, too much forced symmetry between sin and atonement. I still would not discourage anyone from reading it; but I would even more fervently encourage Mr. Hosseini to keep the lovely prose and momentum while losing the quick, cheap fixes."
5,excellent read,"Just finished reading this book. I couldn't put it down. I found this a quick read. Disturbing, moving, powerful, happy, sad are just some of the words I'd use to describe this book. Add me tho list of people who praise this book."
3,Kite Runner,"Khaled takes the reader deep into the heart of the Afganistan country and its people. It is a compelling story of the heartships faced by those under the rule of tyranical leaders that have little regard for human life. The book is a keeper and is most difficult to put down.Reviewed by Will Davis author of ""Bell County Bushwhackers"""
5,Deserves 10 Stars,"Hands down, one of the best books I've ever read. My dad was in the Marine Corps for 22 years, and it's eye-opening to read about life on the other side of the war. I was immediately sucked in to the story, and literally could not put it down. One of the rare books that brought tears to my eyes on a few occasions. Absolutely amazing. I was so overly satisfied with this book that I bought his other book ""A Thousand Splendid Suns,"" which was just as good. I encourage everyone to read this book...you will not be left disappointed."
4,Engrossing and brilliant,"Exactly as mentioned by another reviewer, I picked up this book at the start of a trip and missed everything going on around me after that (including the overhead announcement that we had landed and it was safe to remove seat belts).It's a very well written story of a boy growing up in pre Taliban Afghanistan, writing now through a partly American sensibility.His memories focus on the friend of his childhood, a servant boy named Hassan. That character is so well drawn and so plausible in his earnest loyality and inborn integrity that I was profoundly touched. Even after the relationship and unequal friendship is fractured, and the narrator moves far away to California, those memories and some guilt remain. The grown man returns to Afghanistan hoping to meet and make amends with Hassan.The end, set in Afghanistan under the Talib, is quite harrowing.I highly reccomend this book"
3,Heart-breaking sadness,"The book is very well written and the author really is able to make you feel that you are there with the characters. But the characters go thru overwhelming horrors. I know that Afghanistan has been thru many awful wars and that real people have indeed suffered as much as these characters. But I don't want to feel that much pain, even vicariously. I was very disturbed while reading this, and I don't know that I'll ever forget some of imagery. On the one hand, that is a testament to how well it was written, but I can't recommend that to anyone."
2,What happened?,"This book starts out so brilliantly that you are literally transported into a world of tradition, pain, redemption and love. I highly recommend that you read the first half of The Kite Runner because it's exceptionally beautifully written. However, once the protagonist and his father move to America and even more so when he returns to Afghanistan it feels like a different book. In fact, it feels like a very poor and predictable Hollywood movie. Maybe that's what it will be!"
4,Worth the read,"I read this book and I have to say that it was not as good as I expected it to be, but it was still good. I think this is a great book to read now that we are in the middle of the war. I was educated about the taliban when I read this book. I have to admit i understood better what we are fighting for now. Overall, good book, but did not live up to the attention that is has drawn. If you can't handle child molestation then avoid this book. I really loved Whispers of the wicked saints."
5,I'm not a heavy reader,"I rarely read but this book was given to me as a birthday gift and I thought it was great. I usually read one or two books a year so for me to finish this book before my next birthday is a testament to its quality.This novel is able to do what all great books do: elicit emotion. I found my self furious at times and near tears at others.It's a great book about two children growing up in a far away land and the horrors some see, cause or perform; then trying to make things right in the end. I do not want to give too much away but the story revolves around the main character Amir and his relationship with another boy Hassan. The story follows Amir's life as he grows up with Hassan and Amir's second life in america and what happens when the two worlds collide.I liked it and my girlfriend read it in 3 days after i gave it to her, she reads a book every 2 years."
1,Manipulative,"This author really knows how to stack the deck. He has also created a main character who is pretty despicable yet always seeking the reader's approval--kind of pathetic. Anyway, everyone just love love loves this book, so I decided to read it and was VERY disappointed. Hosseini is not a good writer; he perpetually tries too hard. The more gruesome plot points are calculated to make the reader feel oh-so-outraged and superior, but paradoxically are also rather prurient. The villain is a caricature and there is no plausible explanation for his sadism. I want high quality writing out of a book. In my opinion, this book failed on that score. There is some interesting information about Afghanistan and Kabul, but that was an incidental positive in the mostly negative experience of reading the book."
5,you will not be able to put this book down,Excellently written; high quality literature. This illustrated edition is worth having. Paper quality and chapter design make reading all the more enjoyable. Photos in this edition get you into the scene and enhance the reading experience.
2,Overrated,"My mother recommended this book and I must say that it wasn't worth what little time I do have to enjoy reading a book. Hosseini was overtly revealing about things that were insignificant to the plot which annoyed me. I feel as though he forced some elements in his story and not in a good way like Vladimir Nabokov did. I agree that the overuse of attempted apprehension detracted from any potential this had to become a good, much less great book. I finished feeling cheated of valuable time and with a new sense of what`s considered a ""good read"" by the overwhelming majority. But this is all one man's opinion; two stars for decent quality fiction. Thanks mom. I can't help but wonder if Oprah and Amazon have some sort of monetary arrangement..."
3,interesting story,"Interesting story, sometimes a little hard to take. Some books that move across time periods can become hard to follow but Hosseini does a good job with this one."
2,Depressing,"Well written, but more depressing with the turn of every page.The stark differences between the characters polarized them to the point of not being believable, and it seemed that the story tried to intentionally deal with brutal issues to distract the reader."
5,An excellent read,"An excellent historical insight into pre and post war Afganistan. The book is well written whilst remaining an easy read. The Kite Runner holds a mirror to human nature, reflecting us warts and all."
4,Kite Runner,"This book opened up a world to me that I never fully understood. Before reading this book I knew practically nothing of Afghanistan, or the city of Kabul for that matter. But after this book I understand so much more about what has happened over there, and also the impact it had on families.The Kite Runner was a fast and interesting read for me. It starts off with a young boy, Amir, and his quest to get his fathers approval. His obsession with this quest comes at a price though, and he ends up betraying his closest friend Hassan, and in the end, himself.Through out this emotional roller coaster of a story, Amir finally receives the approval from his father that he's always wanted, and finally makes it up to Hassan in a way that you never see coming. At the end of this book, you will wish that you could just keep on reading, and that the story never ends."
5,Wonderful,"I loved this book! A story of loyalty, love, guilt, shame and jealousy all with very credible characters. Shows the best and worst of people and did not have a corny ending. That is very important to me. I don't have time to read as much as I would like so to get hold of a gem like this was a real pleasure."
5,The Softer Side of Afghanistan,I really enjoyed the touching story that Mr. Hosseini relayed in The Kite Runner. The story grabbed you and made me feel as though I was reading a true autobiography about the boy's life. I am familiar with Afghanistan and found his descriptions of the country very real. I look forward to reading his next book.
1,Not the edition or printing of the book I wanted,"The book was good but Amazon sent me the wrong edition and printing.I only wanted a 1st edition and 1st printing of the book in hardback, I wish I could return it for the book version I ordered and wanted."
1,caveat lector...,"While this novel does contain much rewarding material, potential readers should also be aware that its raison d'tre is a violent act of sodomy luridly and explicitly described by an author who apparently found a certain delight in the telling. Despite what other reviewers have claimed, the book has much more to say about this event than about conditions in Afghanistan."
5,Awesome!,"This is a true page-turner start to finish. Beautifully written, I didn't want it to end. The characters are so inspiring and true, the story spell-binding to the end. Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!"
2,"Definitely not ""A Fine Balance""","Having picked up and put back this book many times over the past year, I finally caved in and read it to see what all the raves were about. My worst fears were confirmed. This is a highly overrated, soap-operatic, flatly written melodrama whose only ticket to success was having been written in English by an Afghani writer. Affirmative action at its worst. There are other reviewers among the hundreds here who have articulated the book's many failings - I encourage prospective readers to look at those first. Skip past the five-star reviews and find those who see this as I do. One laudatory review even compared this to Rohinton Mistry's ""A Fine Balance."" Not by a long shot. Kite Runner is definitely not on par with that masterwork from a much more skilled writer. Not the worst book out there, simply the most undeserving of such lavish accolades."
3,"Good story, but painful to read","A harsh story which although it was very good, I found I wanted it to end. I had to finish the story because I needed to see the characters through to the end, however it was an overall unhappy tale."
5,Very good novel,I was glad to read the novel. When I started reading the book I could actually relate it to the reality. I can imagine the pictorial view point of the author and then was surprised to see that it made a change in me.We all think that just because we have education we have everything but we are wrong since knowledge is better than education. One may forget the matter he is taught in school or college but not what he/she has been taught by life.This is a story of true friendship and loyalty by a friend.
5,A look into the life.............,"A wonderful look into the life of another culture, the whys and hows answered to the things they do. I laughed and cried with him and mourned his friend/brother too.Wonderful book!"
3,Interesting Theme - Disappointing resolution,"Theme: Redemption and how to achieve it.Amir is an affluent Afghan boy who must make atonement for a terrible sin of omission against his boyhood friend, Hassan. The sin plagues him throughout the story, until he finally ""pays"" for it through graphic suffering.The Afghan characters and backdrop are interesting and informative for about 200 pages, at which point the book takes a steep dive in believability.Major character lament: Author denies Soraya's arms the child she'd craved for 15 years, instead saddling her with the sullen Sohrab. Blecch.This is a 4 star/2 star book. Good historical fiction up to a point, but a letdown at the end."
2,eh... ???,"I really tried getting into this book and I just couldn't.I was expecting something like the tv show Charmed, but with one witch, but what I got was a witch who protects people and thinks about sex constantly and says the ""F"" word so much that it loses it's meaning. I am disappointed because I love reading books about witches and witches saving people, and this didn't meet my expectations."
5,I will never look at thanksgiving the same.,"Excellent thriller written by consistent writers of good thrillers. I plowed through this book as if it were a corn field at harvest time. Like all PRESTON/CHILD novels, the prose takes you along at such a swift flow, it's almost impossible to put down without burning to find out what is going to happen next. The characters are superbly developed and put into sweat inducing peril in a way not too many authors can accomplish. The only writers out there that force me to buy the hard cover because I simply cannot wait to devour their next vision. Worth the twenty-five bones and then some."
2,Will have a hard time finishing this book . . .,I'm a little over half-way thru and I really don't know if I can finish it or not. The story is way beyond gruesome one minute and way beyond boring the next. I don't know what the heck is going on and not sure I care. This is probably one of those books where I'll just read the last chapter -- which is happening a lot more often these days with so many sub-par books out there to waste my money on!
1,Waste of time,This is perhaps one of the worst books I have ever read. I only finished it because I can't read a part of a book without reading the whole thing. The last fifty pages were laugh out loud hilarious. And this was meant to be a scary read? Don't waste your time.
5,By far the best of the bunch,"I started with my love for the adventure novel by picking up ""Relic"". Up until then, I would have had to qualify ""Relic"" as the best adventure novel that I had the pleasure of reading. ""Reliquary"" was merely O.K., but their other books all classified as good to great. When I read ""Still Life With Crows"", I was left breathless. I finally got a chance to have a better understand Pendergast as a person the way that I thought I would before reading ""Cabinet of Curiosities"". In my humble opinion, Preston and Child set the standard (along with Crichton, Rollins, and Cussler) of enabling me to simply loose myself within their imaginations."
4,Very good mystery of the corn,"It was weird to see Pendergast in corn country, and this was a good series entry,I enjoyed it very much. But I was just a little disappointed with who the killer turned out to be. I had mixed feelings about that. There could have been something more mysterious about it."
3,Still Life with Crows,"A must read for Preston and Child aficionados. It is not the best of their collaborations, however, I could not put it down for its well written edge of your seat horror mystery style."
2,Seen better by these two.,"I was disappointed with this one. I LOVED Relic, Reliquary, Ice Limit, Thunderhead, etc. But this one was weak plot. Lots of gore and a forced plot."
4,Pendergast is back!,"Without a doubt, the man known only as Pendergast is one of the most interesting characters I've come across over the years. The fact that he's a repeating character in the Preston and Child books only makes him more interesting because each book he's in gives you a bit more insight as to what makes him tick.This book is a really good read, with great characters, an interesting plot, a great protagonist in Pendergast and some really big twists. Anyone into mysteries will enjoy this book. And because Pendergast is in it, it should be a treat for any Preston and Child fan. The reader gets some more glimpses of what type of man he is, but even more questions are raised about him and his past. Which makes me wait with baited breath for the next one he may appear in.Definetly worth checking out with an ending that'll have you saying 'Ohhh!!! I get it!'"
4,Something a little different.,"It was a really good book. The setting was not my favorite, but once I got into the book the murders got me hooked. I enjoyed the book immensely and would recommend it. I intend to read BRIMSTONE next ASAP. S.L.W.C. was my fifth Preston/Child book having read RELIC, RELIQUARY, THUNDERHEAD, and CABINET OF CURIOSITIES.But, I did not like the following-a) somewhat one-dimensional boring characters,b) that the gross turkey factory had nothing to do with what happened,c) that what did happen was just sociological and that took the fun right out of it,d) there was something wrong with the whole atmosphere of Kansas. It didn't quite ring true for me. Come on teenage purple-haired goth chick assisting Special Agent P.?! Whew that was a lot to swallow. and finallye) the ending being so easy to figure out."
4,"good, but not the best","This particular book is good, but not the best by this talented duo, IMHO (I like the C of C the best). There is an absence of the high-tech aspect that is present in their other works, which I missed. However, Special Agent Pendergast is brought to light and I must admit that this character is entrancing. We even learn the first two letters of his first name!Readers who enjoy who-done-its, suspense and brutal murders will like this book. You won't know who the perp is until the very end, trust me. This is because the authors are masters at misleading the reader into making wrong guesses.I give this book 4 of 5 stars because I think the ending is a bit too odd to be convincing."
4,I love these guys!,"I was hoping that this book would scare me, but it didn't. And even though it wasn't too exciting I still loved it and I'm now hooked on the authors. I absolutely love their style of writing. I have no expectation of being thrilled by their other books, but will continue to read everything they put out!"
4,"Freaky, freaky bad guy","Ahh, so this is Pendergast's idea of a vacation. Scary and impossible to predict, Still Life with Crows will keep you far, far away from the corn fields of the midwest for life. The vivid imagery will haunt you for days afterward.Definately worth the read."
1,"Do not be fooled by the picture, it is missing important item",I agree with previous reviewer that it come with missing piece and this is very unethical of seller. I am also amazed how amazon do not control such faked advertisment
5,"Finally, the ammo I've been looking for","""What Liberal Media?"" is the book for those of us who are conviced of the lunacy of the charge of liberal media bias but who don't have the time to do the research ourselves. Alterman exposes the persistent silliness and paranoid wackiness of many of the right's loudest voices, including Limbaugh, Coulter and O'Reilley. The shock to me is realizing the degree to which the right has intimidated the center and left, which labor under the disability of having a conception of fairness to others than themselves.""WLM?"" is frightening in its implications. By silencing the left and center, the right has set the nation on an ever-rightward course. I applaud Eric Alterman's courage in so carefully documenting his case, rather than just becoming a shrill voice on the left."
5,ideal tonic for complacent liberals,"Alterman's book strikes a nimble balance between careful research and effervescent prose....it's the perfect book for that mass of complacent liberals who would benefit from an alternative to the corporate media (not to mention the scariness of Coulter, Limbaugh, O'Reilly et al). By mixing well-documented facts with his own irrepressible wit (and admitted liberalism), Alterman's book should be required reading for anyone who gives the current state of politics and social policy even a passing thought.I was particularly struck by Alterman's indictment of the corporate power behind the media. The largely unnoticed (and continuing -- see the current attempts by the FCC for even more deregulation) consolidation of the media is one of the more disquieting trends in American culture. One can only hope that attempts, like Alterman's, to shine a light on this trend are read by as many people as possible."
4,A new light for the media.,"As a student at Oklahoma State University, I am very interested in journalism and broadcasting. Eric Alterman's book opens my eyes to many new ideas about conservative and liberal media. The purpose of the book is to inform people of the different bias parts in the media. Alterman does a wonderful job of showing both the conservative side and the liberal side in the media. After reading through the book, I came to discover that the liberal media is looked at differently than I look at it. I recommend this book to anyone that is interested in learning about the different views in the media."
5,Anyone who gives this one star...,"falls into one of several categories: 1. Illiterate (because they obviously didn't read the book and must be attacking it based on an opinion or belief that they learned from someone else) 2. Hater (street term for someone who needs to put down others in a vain, misguided attempt to create a sense of self-worth) 3. ....Okay, I was wrong, there are only two categories."
1,Ship of Fools,"A book denying liberal bias in the media, written by a member of Journolist - hundreds of *exclusively* liberal media workers conspiring online in slanting or killing news items, slandering conservatives (""Instead, take one of them -- Fred Barnes, Karl Rove, who cares -- and call them racists. Ask: why do they have such a deep-seated problem with a black politician who unites the country?"") and spinning like mad to in pursuit of their political goals.This isn't journalism.The author (and his co-conspiritors)unwillingly debunked his book when details of journolist surfaced. Bummer, huh?"
1,A radical liberal rant,"Alterman seems to have zero understanding of the difference between commentators, journalists and newscasters. Is Limbaugh conservative? Well, last time I checked he was. Does he pretend to be a newscaster? Never.Did the publisher of the New York Times say he would rather see an American soldier die in a fight with a Communist in Viet Nam? Yes he did and has never denied it. Does that make him one the the conservative elites who control the media? I don't think so.Alterman's book is a classic example of left-wing writers who just ""don't get it."" He thinks he is ""mainstream"" when the radical journals he writes for wouldn't hire a conservative if their lives depended on it.This book is good fantasy for his fellow travelers, but is pure garbage when it comes to telling ""The Truth.""Save your money."
1,Give me a break!,"I can't believe this! The author is so liberal, that he does not even see the liberal bias in the media. I don't want to debate the author, but just look at CNN, MSNBC and don't forget the 3 majors...ABC, NBC and CBS. They never tell you both sides of the story. The only news network I have seen that comes close is the Fox News Channel. If you live in the Liberal/Socialist dream world, then this is the book for you. If you have any common sense and can think for yourself, you will see right through this."
3,Maybe You Ought to Be Paying Attention,"""A Reader from Seattle,"" who couldn't be bothered to use his real name, wrote:> This is not fact, he comes up with numbers> and percentages that are incorrect, at one> point he accually says that Al Gore did> invent the internet and that the media tried> to mar this. He is assuming all his readers> are uneducated or just not paying attention.I saw Alterman on The Daily Show (as ""A Reader"") did, but I was paying attention. Alterman didn't say that Gore invented the Internet, he used the myth of Gore inventing the Internet as an example of how the media (sometimes willfully) gets things wrong.I haven't read Alterman's book yet, but I can't wait to do so. I fear, as others have mentioned, that the only people who will read it are people who already believe Alterman's central thesis. Still, it's true that as long as a book like this is out there, there is the chance someone will read it and have his or her mind changed. Here's hoping."
4,GREAT GAME but takes too long to get good,"I love this game! It's really cool how they find out the island is really a...Oops, can't give it away. I like the fish withen the fish and faces withen the face, but the difference is the fish is serious, but the face is a joker(WELL...Look, I'm not suppossed to do this, but it's been so long since me and my brothers had company anyway.) Silly, isn't it? I always do the sea first, then land. I like all the history you learn on land, but the activites you do take a long time. I do like the place where it rains fish, and the great cryptile thief was cool. The best part is when they get inside the island the tables turn, and you play Owen and Leslie instead of Joni and Santiago. I recomend this game for any 4th and 5th graders(After all, I was a 4th grader when I played it). Sencerly, Russian Blue Witch."
4,an awesome game,"This was a really fun game! There were a lot of funny parts, and most of the games were fun and easy. I was either in 4th or 3rd grade when i completed the whole entire thing, but the parts I really dreaded were the fish within the fishes and that other part. The Fish Within the Fishes was way tooooooo boring and on my computer every single CrypTile except one it won't accept. So I hope you found this helpful."
2,It's just okay...,"This is a nice little book with proverbs, sayings, bible passages and maxims but it's just ""blah"" in format. It's not a bad book but it's not a great book either. There are several other books which standout compared to this one...it's just ho hum."
5,Excellent product,Product was perfect and very well made fit bike exactly how it was suppose to. You only need one of these to do both the front and back brakes
3,Item was sent just as described. In timely fashion.,The information provided for this item was well described. It was informative and helpful. I recieved the item in a reasonable amount of time.
5,A handy and durable pocket dictionary (for big pockets),"I am a fan of the Langenscheidt pocket dictionaries. They are amazingly informative for such a small format. The symbols, definitions, pronunciation, and forms of the words are just enough to help you understand the meaning of the word you are looking up while still keeping the book in a size you really can put in a (big) pocket. The German-English in the front and the English-German is in the back.There are extra helps with proper names, irregular verbs, abbreviations, and guides to pronunciation in both languages. Reading them before you start using the dictionary will pay dividends in helping you get full value from it. If for nothing else you will know what is there and what is available when specific question presents itself.The vinyl covers are great and very durable and the binding stands up to years of use. I can't praise this series of dictionaries enough.reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI"
3,Interesting read,"An interesting and quick read about an exciting story. However, although the book is highly entertaining for a reader curious about the origins and development of Resorts it does lack substance and detail. Many of the stories in the book are somewhat vague and appear to be included merely as a measure of sensationalism rather than to make a specific point. The main executives in the book could also have been described in more detail."
3,one complaint,"My only complaint is tht I found the same product on JOMASHOP at $3,695 dlls. beside that I am satisfied with the product"
4,Beautiful Color and NEC quality,"I replaced an old 1995 NEC 21"" tube monitor with this. The old 1995 monitor still had beautiful color when I switched, but I wanted a smaller form factor and something a little easier on the eyes.Only reason for four stars is it is somewhat pricey. Otherwise I love it.I tried a ViewSonic 22"", but took it back because I hated the color and the rectangular native aspect ratio. It made everything look skewed. I work on a computer, I don't watch movies on it, so I need the native 1600 x 1200 aspect ratio.This monitor is more expensive, but if you want very good color representation in the standard aspect ratio (good for picture rendering), then this is a good monitor.I have been using it for about four months and am very happy with it. I actually bought two of them, one at work and one at home, and have had zero problems. I hope it has the same NEC quality as my old 1995 monitor. So far, so good."
3,Good but could use improvement,"The socks do NOT fit (one size fits all). You have to really struggle to make them line up with points. However, after some work, I was able to get them in the appropriate place. They are very well designed, with regards to detail and being color coordinated. I would just like to see them fit better or for the company to make actual sizes, requiring less work for consumer."
1,Just doesn't deliver,"I thought the cardscan would be a big time saver. The scan function works just OK. All cards require some editing. The synchronization is just worthless with Outlook and Act. I found that you could not have a middle initial, prefix or suffix. A duplicate deleted in cardscan and ACT cannot be resolved. The only way to use this hardware is to forget synchronization. Just create a new file whenever you have a bunch of cards to scan and export the data. Great idea - inadequate software."
2,Not Worth the Money,Without being able to transfer graphics this cardscan is a waste of money. I am sure for a business person the cardscan might be of some use to transfer data. I would like to store and transfer the complete card with the graphics.
1,won't order from this company again...,"I am the office manager at a small documentary film company and we use DVD mailers to ship our DVDs around the world and to fill our orders. I have always ordered this same type of DVD mailer, however this time, the mailers sent were not the ones pictured at all. They are too small to fit most DVDs, they are flimsy, poor quality. I do not recommend this product for shipping DVDs. Usually Media Supply fills this order, and they have always send high quality mailers.. this order I guess was filled by Starmicro Access Inc, and I was very disappointed."
5,great product,This is exactly what I was looking for and couldn't find in any store. Just what I needed and came quickly too. Thanks!
1,nothing new here,"Apparantly, the way to get filthy, stinking rich is to write a book like this and have all the ""rich boy wannabes"" buy it. This book has no ""earth-shattering""revelations in it; in fact, it is not even a good instructional manual. It tells the reader to get rich by starting his own business. OK, that's fine. I agree you'll never get rich by working for someone else. But starting a business is risky(remember, the Small Business Administration states that 90% of newly opened businesses in this country fail in the first year!). And this book really doesn't offer any practical info to get you started."
3,Not as pleased as other reviewers of this product,"I chose to buy these binoculars because of the great reviews here on Amazon. I am not nealry as pleased as the previous reviewers. The binoculars are pretty powerful, and you can see a far distance, but I dislike them for the following reasons: first, they have that whole ""one lense goes gray"" issue. I have to hold my mouth just right to get a clear view in both lenses. The eye adjustment is never quite right, and the most annoying thing is that both lense caps are too big for the lense and they fall off every time I take the binoculars out of the case. I would go with a different pair of binoculars if I could do it all over again. Even if I had to spend a little more money."
1,Total self-indulgent hype.......,Ashby is a true legend in his own lunchtime. The man's ego defies belief....I only hope the three men who 'escaped' with him write their own account one day; I suspect it will vary greatly from Ashby's highly elaborate version of events.Don't be fooled by this Walter Mitty character....
2,Difficult,"Even though I have used Illustrator for several years, I found the steps and tips a little confusing. I bought this book to increase my knowledge.It wasn't too helpful, especially when steps are skipped, and the tips don't correspond with the instructions. In one area the instructions read, ""expand and ungroup, (about a million times) to delete the wireframe."" Didn't work for me."
2,hollywoodbob,Not for beginners. Tips and adjoining windows don't seem to match. Projects were helpful in teaching you to be able to use the techniques for your own projects or creativity. But on the whole I don't feel the book was worth the price.
3,Doesnt look new,"I bought this book for my husband and it said the book was brand new, when it arrived, the cover was torn with marks all over them."
3,GE Answering machine,"To date, it is working as advertised. I wish that recorded message could be a little clearer; it seems that tape messages were a lot clearer than digital."
2,Don't Be Fooled,"Don't be fooled by this products description. Although it promises four ""mailboxes,"" in the answering machine sense of the word, it DOES NOT have four mailboxes. You CANNOT record an outgoing message for each mailbox, you're only allowed an A or B choice of outgoing annoucement and if you tell folks to press 2, 3 or 4, all they'll get is a beep and then time to record, you can't leave any further instructions. So, not really a ""mailbox"" answering machine!"
2,GE Answering Machine,The machine was priced right which is why I chose it. I've owned it for about a year. This answering machine is unreliable. I record my message and the machine drops my message and reverts to the stock message at least once a week. It also drops the current date and time I enter. It is frustrating and I am going to buy another answering machine that is a different brand.
1,Loosing Greating Message all the time,"Regardless of replacing the 9V Battery almost once a week, this machinekeeps loosing the Greeting Message all the time.Voice Quality is also not very good."
4,Is new and improved better?,"I bought this item for my mother after owning a similar one for many years. The interface on this newer one is not as intuitive and some functions seem to be less usuable. My old GE answering machine had three mailboxes and had been a steady workhorse for over 10 years. With this new one, only time will tell how long it lasts."
2,Don't recommend,"I've been through two of these things in about 6 months. You'd think I'd learn, but I'm always in a rush, and it was the only one I could find with 40 min record time. The backup battery often failed, it often cut off my callers, then twice, it outright died and I'd have to buy a new one. When it worked, it did work pretty well and has a lot of features for the money. But this time, I think I have to go AT + T."
3,There are no really high quality message mahines today,"This is just as good (or bad) as any other machine I have had. Sometimes it cuts people off and doesn't take the message. When it does, the message is only barely discernable at times. OK, but not great. I would gladly pay double for good recording quality, but can't find it. Everyone seems to have gone to telephone company voice mail. But then they don't know when a message has come in, so they never return your call!"
3,mediocre sound quality,"Not having compared this model other answering machines in this price range, I found that while the greeting I recorded comes through loud and clear, the quality of the audio on the messages left are substandard compared to my old mini-cassette based answering machine."
5,A refreshingly different kind of CSS book....,"You (if you're like me) have seen a ton of books on CSS. They repeat the basics without increasing you knowledge- or without telling you what you want to know. This book is different. You know the basics- Wyke-Smith tells you how to use create the pages you want. Finally a book that doesn't read like a spec sheet. To the author, Thanks."
3,Average read for intermediate skills,"With an intermediate skill set in CSS, I found this book to be average. It is geared more towards beginners. I found several errors which I reported to the publisher and learned that the book had a tight production schedule.If you have intermediate skills, don't bother with this book. If you're a novice, you will find it's easy-to-read style helpful to learning CSS."
3,A little awkward for the beginner,"Pros: This book covers a lot of ground and offers insight to efficient ways of handling CSS, dealing with the box model, and controlling floats. The book also covers more advanced solutions for drop down menus. The sample code from the books companion website is excellent!Cons: This could be a personal thing... The writing and examples in this book tend to be confusing and thus lengthen the learning curve, but if you download the comprehensive library of sample code from the books companion website, this should be less of an issue.At first I didn't see a lot of value to this book, but after digging deeper, I've come to understand that my own habits in working with CSS were fighting with the more sophisticated approach presented by writer Charles Wyke-Smith."
2,Sucky McSucky from Sucktown,"I know we all like to crash on the beach with a good, trashy novel, but come on ladies! I'm not saying we have to curl up with Kierkegaard, but at least give our ""heroine"" some depth. Then at least I could reason why this woman is so awful - to her friends, to her parents and to her boyfriends. She's a whiner, whining through unbelievable and often ill-written sagas."
2,"Make no mistake, This is Chick Lit.","Based on the hype, I was expecting a well-written novel with some depth, in the vein of Candace Bushnell/Laura Zigman, and instead what I got was something that could have just as easily been a Little Red Dress Ink property.The characters aren't anything close to loveable, the trite cliches are not just peppered throughout the book, they are poured over every conversation that takes place.PLEASE don't waste your time with this. Read ""Trading Up"" or ""Cooking for Mr Latte"" or ""Family Trust"" instead."
2,EEl skin,I was not impressed by the quality of this item or lack there of. The eel skin is a bit stiffer than I wanted or expected. Difficult to get cards in and out of.
2,Great Acting! Terrible Script!,"There is almost no character development in this movie. Within the span of ten minutes the two characters, Barbara and Sheba (Dench and Blanchett) meet, become friends, then Barbara becomes obssessed with Sheba and Sheba becomes obssessed with a teenage boy. The acting by the two principles is great. The script is terrible. It is shoddy, slipshod, and totally unbelievable. Dench makes a ""creepy"" obsessed lesbian with a penchant for younger women while Blanchett is perfect as an unfulfilled wife and mother with a penchant for young boys. Worth a look for the great acting but if you want a good story.....forget it. The ending is predictable and stupid as well."
5,"Wow, really great acting and direction; suspenseful yet intelligent","My wife and I watched this last weekend, and were thrilled to find a really fine movie. Cate Blanchette is great -- strong, complex, sexy but not lewd in a really well developed role, beautifully acted. Judy Dench, whose acting I have heard of but not really seen that much is truly engaging and real; she really is a great actress.The movie is solid and serious without being so heavy as to not be entertaining. There's great tension, and wonderful uncertainty of the outcome without falling into the trap of many suspense movies -- this movie is not truly unwound until the end, but nor is it contrived into some fantastic twist in the final scene.We loved it."
3,"Good phone, bad answering machine","The telephone itself seems very well-made. I have not had any problems with reception, battery, volume etc... However, the answering machine is terrible. The recording quality is very poor, it sounds very tinny and weak. Whenever someone calls but hangs up before they leave a message, the machine records one anyway (a 5-second clicking noise). The message number light is very faint and goes off frequently. This makes it hard to know if there are any new messages if you don't have an audible beep. For a person on a tight budget, this phone might be acceptable, but otherwise, keep looking."
2,The novel is a dud.,"I bought this book after reading an ecstatic review praising it as ""an absolute gut-buster."" Although there are a (very) few funny moments in the novel (mainly in the beginning), most of the story is pretty stale. The author tries to punch up the plot with various action sequences: someone pulling a gun on someone, scaling a building, etc. Unfortunately, these scenes don't work as action or comedy and just bog down the story. The author tries to create humor by featuring wacky groups of characters: a Jamaican drug gang, a Mexican drug gang, black muslims, redneck vets. Unfortunately, he doesn't do anything very interesting with them.I really wanted to like this novel. But it is, as General Haversham might put it, ""a crashing bore."""
5,very sturdy,"This is the longest litter scooper I've ever had, but also the sturdiest. It allows you to scoop up the mess without being so close to the box, which is nice. Very pleased with it."
5,LOVE THEM,"THESE PAMPERS HOLD ALLOT, MY SON IS NOT BEING POTTY TRAINED SO THEY HOLD EVERYTHING. THEY ALSO WORK OVER NIGHT. BUT SOMETIMES AT NIGHT THEY WILL LEAK BUT THATS IF HE SLEEPS AN EXTRA LONG NIGHT. I THINK I HAVE ONLY HAD 2 TIMES THEY LEAKED AND THAT WAS WHEN HE SLEPT FOR OVER 11 HOURS. GREAT PRICE TOO"
1,Sides are not reattaching like Huggies,"I purchased these as a cheaper alternative to Huggies pull ups. I thought they were all the same.These do not come apart at the sides like the Huggies pull ups or diapers... you have to remove pants and shoes to put them on. I will never buy these again, they just make the difficult portion of potty training more difficult.It is not just me, my day care hates them too."
2,"Surprised by skin reaction, we love Pampers.","We love Pampers!! I have two little boys and have used Pampers on them from day one. I tried other diapers that leaked or smelled horrible. Overall I would highly recommend Pampers brand. However, these easy ups don't have the soft classic baby powder scent as I am used to. The smell reminds me of women's panty liners....which I do not like. My son also experienced a rash / skin reaction to this easy up. Pampers was GREAT! I called and expressed my concern and they were very helpful. We have since moved to the Huggies brand pull up and have had no reaction. The Huggies are non-scented too."
5,Good Buy!,"I bought these at a real good price. I really don't need them now, since I do have a 1 yr. old, but I have used them in the past for my other kids and I loved them."
4,EASY UPS,They seem to do pretty well. I have learned that he cannot wear these to bed because they will leak by the time he wakes up.
3,mixed feelings,"I got these for my almost 3 year old. They are very absorbent, softer, more padded than huggies pull ups. my son is skinny 27lbs so I think I think 3T-4T was too big. They kept slidding down. I read the reviews that said they run small, so I ordered a size up. The problem for him was the butt part, it was narrow almost like a thong and he doesn't have a big butt."
1,Worst pull ups ever,"I bought these instead of my usual huggies to try and save some money... Worst mistake of my life! These smelled so awful like chlorine and chemicals and actually burned my sons skin.. he is still raw now and he hasn't been in a pamper or pull up for a week.. I decided to go back to huggies after he heals and then to work on getting him in underwear full time. These leak easily, I don't recommend for overnight wear at all nor extended wear.. I also don't like how they were skin tight on him! 3-4t in huggies are perfect.. these were so much smaller!"
4,"Love the product, Sizing a bit small","My son loves these. It really helps with potty training, especially since he loves Diego. The only thing I didn't like was the sizing. My son just turned 2 and the 3T-4T was small on him."
3,Not on time,"Was supposed to receive shipment today and still have not received it. I enjoy receiving it in the mail, as this means I do not have to try and make a special trip 40 miles into town to pick up a big box, but it is inconvenient when I am told one day and it doesn't arrive until a day or 2 later. I end up needing to make a trip for a small supply to get us through."
3,I'll stick with Huggies...,"I bought these through subscribe and save because they were a great price. However, I was very disappointed with the quality of them.First off, they do not have easy tear sides like huggies, and second they run very, very small. I normally order a 3T/4T for my son because he is a bigger kid and very tall, but these were more like a 2T/3T, tiny. They work, but I certainly can't wait for him to notice that they are wet, or he soaks through them.Last, but certainly not least, they don't have any incentive for kids to keep them dry. There is no cool sensation and the colors are not nearly bright enough.Sad to say, even with the great price I will not be renewing this subscription and will go back to paying more for a better product!!"
2,not good for night time use,My son is day trained but wets the bed. Use these only for nights my son frequently wakes up soaked through.
2,Needs better side openings,"Huggies training diapers let you open & reseal on the sides -- not so with these (you can tear open the sides to take them off, but they're not going back on). That was a deal breaker."
3,Runs small,"I bought these easy-ups in a size 5 for my son who is a bit chuncky in the thighs, and the are pretty snug in that area when pulling them up. I bought these diapers for the times when he's on the go and needs a quick change. I would recommend buying a size bigger if your kid has chuncky thighs as well. Also they don't absorb as much as my usual diapers."
1,These are the worse diapers I've ever used!!!,"These diapers are horrible. My 22 month old son leaked through them like he wasn't wearing any diapers at all. They are ok only when we are home during the daytime because he always removes them & use his potty when necessary. They are totally useless during the night time or when we are away from home. I went out with him today and he went through three pairs of shorts!! I even had to change his shirt once because the urine got on it. (Thank goodness I was prepared with extra outfits.) I'm very disappointed because I am a fan of Pampers. I'll try Huggies Pull Ups next or just go back to standard diapers. His size 3 Luvs worked just fine, plus I got 204 of them (at BJs)for the same price as the Easy Ups. It was easier for him to remove them at potty time too."
1,dont buy these,"i usually buy huggies brand but they were out of stock.so i thought id try these ,bad mistake.i was putting them on my toddler and one side tore half way off.this happens everytime i put them on him.there is no velcro on the sides,everytime they have to be changed i have to undress my son,which is not good when you have to do it in a public bathroom with theyre filthy floors.these leak like crazy,also when my son pulls them down the rest of the training pants tears off,so even if they werent full they have to be changed again,which means i have to undress him yet again."
4,"Great training pants, but would be better with detachable sides","I have tried both Pampers Easy Ups and Huggies Pull Ups...I like to the Easy Ups especially for beginning potty training because they hold more like a diaper. I started my son out on Pull Ups, but I was changing his pull up and pants several times a day. With the Easy Ups, he knows they are wet when he wets thems, but instead of having to change his pants too, I can simply put on a new Easy Up and he is good to go. The only reason I gave them 4 starts instead of 5 is because you have to tear the sides apart if you need to take it off without pulling it down like underwear. Another plus is the Pamper smell...I love the way their pampers smell and the Easy Ups have that same smell!"
2,The product is fine but the strategy is bad,"I had my kid in underpants. Daycare wanted him in pull-ups. with the ease of pull-ups he regressed to pooping himself. This are still handy for nighttime, but mostly they un-pottytrained my boy."
4,Hack//game music,"I have played this game and watched the anime and read the manga. If u enjoied the music from the game u with diffinatly enjoy this sound track. While u r listening to it, it brings back scenses and memories of the game and may make you want to play it again. U don't need to be fremiliar with .hack to listen to the sound track. I bought this CD mostly for my mom because how she said the music in the game was so pretty."
5,Sylvia Browne's Lessons for life,Sylvia Browne has some of the best books that I love to read. You never get board with reading them and they really help you in understanding the things she writes about. I recommend her books to everyone.
4,A Fast Read,"This was a good book. I read it in one nite and I love the way the writer made it flow. If you looking for a good fast read, then this is the book for you."
4,cool game,"Excellent game to pass the time. Ziogolf is verysimilar to any other desktop golf computer game.Good way to enjoy a game with your children.After a while, they will surpass you. Highly recommended."
5,Great memories,"I got this for my Dad for Valentine's Day and it was a great time to watch it again. Such was Jim Henson's fame for family and children entertainment that if the request came to you to be on Sesame Street or even The Muppet Show, it was really a simple choice.The special is really not meant for children but rather for adults, since most of the guests are ones children are not familiar with. It's also fun to see people like Ralph Nader and Barbara Walters poking fun and getting poked in return.The entire show is fantastic, but the best two clips are ""Put Down the Duckie"" and Seiji Ozawa's conducting the Muppet Orchestra in ""Pretty Great Performances....he really is a good sport. Overall, a excellent tribute to the Classic Sesame Street and to Jim Henson."
1,"Don't bother with this action figure, or any of the Spidey 3 figures for that matter...","Something stinks. Why does Hasbro have the Spidey 3 license? Toy Biz has handled the Spidey movie toys since the first film and they've made fantastic figures. Now Hasbro somehow got their awful mitts on it and have churned out these TERRIBLE figures. This ""super-articulated"" Spidey is nowhere near as articulated as its Spidey 1 and 2 predecessors. It lacks joints all over the place and is an inch and a half smaller than the previous movie figures. Don't waste your money on any of these Spidey 3 figures. Hopefully someone will make better figures than these."
3,Good basic introductory undergraduate text,The book is a good text for an undergraduate introduction to the field of engineering geology. It is well written and provides a broad overview of the subject. It is given three stars because it has not been updated and may not reflect the more recent advances in the science.
5,Excellent Movie!!,This is an excellent movie about an unwed teenage mother who becomes a prostitute in order to support herself.It's a must see!!
1,Immediate Failure,"Initially I was thrilled to find this book light. I have a desk top Verilux Natural Spectrum light and have been pleased with the natural spectrum light and it's performance. I was completely underwhelmed with the Verilux travel light. When I turned it on for the first time the high beam light was clear and bright. It completely illuminated the page. As I settled in to read, the light flickered. Within minutes it was flickering nonstop. Then the high beam setting completely failed. I was left with a subpar low beam light. This light was not sufficient to completely illuminate the page so I was forced to make adjustments to read the lower half of the page. I do not recommend this book light."
4,Verilux Book Light,"This is a great little book light for Night Owls who don't want to disturb their partner. However, the batteries have a really short life. My 1st set last just under a week."
2,Dim but funtional,"This light is bright enough for me to read by with no other illumination, but the optimal brightness appears to be 4in from the bulb. There's a distinct drop in intensity past that point. Also, there's a lot of light scatter from this lamp, so it's dim but still manages to be intrusive.The quality of the light is slightly cool without having that too blue LED corpse-like quality, and if it were just brighter or better focused, I would be quite happy with this.Yes, the clip is flimsy but I prefer it as a stand anyway. The battery cover is quite robust; don't hold the unit by the clip when trying to open the battery compartment or the clip will pop off before the cover does."
1,Clamp bait-n-switch,BEWARE. I ordered two lamps and both of them had flimsy plastic clamps and not metal clamps as advertised. I've emailed amazon to see if they will address this or else I will have to return them.Looks like they have switched the clamps. Deceptive.
4,Cheaply Made but Works Well with Kindle,"Overall, I am happy with this and it is the best light I have found for use with a Kindle. I have added some velcro attachments (actually 3M Picture Hanging strips because they make it easier to attach and detach the light than it would be with Velcro) at the top back of the Kindle DX and use them to attach the light. The Light itself has a couple of pivots so it can be adjusted to minimize/eliminate a glare spot. It provides nice, relatively even light over the entire Kindle DX screen. A little brighter at the top than the bottom but not bad at all. I like that you can use re-chargeable batteries and that you can recharge them using a USB connector (provided, as is a carrying case). Only disappointment is the build quality. Just feels kind of cheap."
1,Magicaly resets it's combo!,"Actually thank god that bolt cutters snip through this thing because if you accidentally flick your wrist a certain way while locking this bike **the combo lock resets itself**. Which is why I'm sitting here writing this and my bike is no longer hostage at my area Whole Foods (I tried 30 minutes of ""one off"" number combos before running to my local hardware store, it had done this once before and I had figured out the new combo)But that really makes this bike lock $35.00 more expensive than listed (price of said bolt cutters). And it also makes my bike a lot easier to steal.Guy at the hardware store who commiserated suggested kryptonite...says they are impossible to cut and most lock with a key - just better not lose that key."
1,Lock was stuck so I had to cut it in under one minute,"Like the other reviews here, it is vital that you avoid this lock. I went to Target looking for a U-Lock but they were to big for me so I bought this instead thinking I was getting a deal. I can't explain it any better than Feeling like I was wasting my money even after I bought it. Sure enough, three weeks later I lock up my bike at the public library and come back only to notice that I can't get the lock to open. I try WD-40 and even check online to see if I can ""hack"" the lock. I was not successful so I borrowed bolt cutters from my neighbor and couldn't help but feel like a thief because several people actually watched me cut the lock and see me ride off with my own bike. On top of that, it took less than one minute to cut the cable. Don't buy this lock!"
1,Worse than no lock at all.,"My bicycle was stolen yesterday while I used this lock. It was stolen from a high traffic area in front of tons of people so it must not have take much effort to cut through this lock. Looks like it was a single cut. Like another reviewer said, I will never buy another lock without a theft guarantee. This lock is worse than no lock at all because it gives you a false sense of security."
5,A great book to end the Hardy Boys mystery stories!,"When I looked on the computer about ""The Sting of the scorpion"" I thought it was a bad book to read but when I read it I went on the computer and rated it. The book IS a great book to end the Hardy Boys mysteries."
2,Be aware that they ship used item,"I ordered two of this and I got used item which had some stain spots, hair, and towel debris. When I returned the items for a replacement, I was told that the ware house didn't have any stock and also they don't have any plan to get more. I returned mine four weeks ago. And now it is available. I better think carefully before you order this item. I hope you don't get the one that I returned."
3,QUIRKY,"The movie runs about 6 subplots making things a bit confusing. I felt like I was watching pieces of a half dozen different movies. The film starts out with an electronic bank robbery attempt, some welfare slackers, an assassin killing a man, undercover cops, the computer hacker helping a criminal, and a rich man being told his wife is having an affair..I think that is most of it.The subplots start to come together, some through a case of mistaken identity and errors. The plot was enjoyable as was most of the actors. The manner in which it was directed and weak sound track kept it from becoming a classic. For those who like a quirky movie from time to time, try it out.F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
4,good for wannabe programmers,"I enjoyed the use of real-world examples in this book. I'm a java programmer who used a little bit of javascript at work but wanted to learn more about it. This is a good book for someone thinking about getting into programming. It introduces you to some basic programming practices (loops, variables, functions) while teaching you javascript. For this same reason, I would not recommend this book to a programmer."
4,Excellent...but lacks something,"GREAT book...Very good layout...Lacking some information that you gotta figure out on your own (...)? Nah, it's a GREAT book...Take my word for this, just think about it and be logical about it and try it --> For any book, especially those advanced and professional books, it's better to spend reading, practing, and applying one concept for a whole week until you can do a task even while dreaming, rather than finishing a chapter in one hour and moving on, but if you try to accomplish a task, you would have to go back and seem like you're doing read, enter-in-mind, write, exit-from-mind."
3,Javascript Cookbook,"This is more of a cookbook than a true guide. Thau uses examples he lifts from other sites to make each example. The reason I label it more cookbook than guide is the entire book is laid out poorly from start to finish with no sense of overall reason.So, judging from that angle this book does an acceptable job of presenting the material. It shoots from one topic to the next, with barely enough time spent explaining the first before presenting the second. The best example would be to picture a ferret on speed the understand the lack of depth offered by this book. Based upon that, it does cover a significant number of topics, just none of them in detail.The biggest fault is that you can get better (meaning less typos and mistakes) code and example freely on the web than is offered in the book. So, use this book as a launching pad for discovering better resources elsewhere."
2,Kindle Edition - did not get full book,"I purchased the Kindle edition and it ends in the middle of a section. The last page is 3940 and it says 100%, but this is not the end of the book. Last line shown is ""It was as if Pierre's death had taken some of her life too."" (Not that it matters that much - I did not enjoy the book.)"
3,Serpentine plot,"This story is classically serpentine--it's difficult to keep up with the constant switches in time. It goes to a fro' from the present to 20 or so years before when our hero is dismissed from the CIA for no apparent reason. The senior CIA man resposible for this end-of-career hatchet job, apparently nurses a terrible grudge against our hero and his frustration comes to a head in an attempt to kill the protagonist some 20-30 years after they had parted company in Washington. All those years ago, his CIA chief found his wife in bed with our hero....and so the basis of the long-smoldering resentment and the motivation for murder. One negative is the fact that the protagonist, who has lived in France many years and had left his wife and children to fend for themselves in the U.S., is not a very likeable character.So three stars."
2,"great film, but...","There are many great things about this movie - the historical insights, the wonderful cast, the well-written story, etc. But a word to those who, like me, wish to avoid films with nudity...unfortunately, there is indeed a bathtub scene with female nudity."
1,"If I could give it a zero, I would","After using Printmaster, this just does not measure up. One of the most convoluted setups I have ever seen. NOT user friendly. Mine is going in the trash."
4,I wish the book was on Kindle.,"When I find a book that causes me to think past the normal everyday rut, I love to mark them up with the old yellow marker. Well my copy is well marked so that I can do a bit of meditation on the points. Please Amazon, give us a Kindle version so that we can find information that is needed quickly.I do not agree with everything written and I would never expect to. Each rune worker should have personal insights on runes so that they can find help and guidance with their current problems. I feel that Mr Thorsson delivers that ""push"" to help you find your right path."
2,Not for beginners,"I had read with interest the reviews offered by other readers, thought this would be a great beginners guide to Runes. I will agree it is an incredible in depth look into the Runes and rituals. I would not however recommend for beginners, slow read and hard to follow. I would encourage, from a beginners stand point, readers find an easier and less in depth book to start out. I would also recommend a large dictionary if you intend to purchase..."
4,Deadwood season 1,"I got this for my husband as a gift. He loves the show but the language is horrible. Every few words is a cuss word. However, he loves the show enough that I'm getting the next 2 seasons for him."
1,Waste of Good Money,"I purchased this for viewing as were RVing through the Black Hills of South Dakota thinking I might learn something interesting about the history of that area. After about 30 minutes I knew this a complete waste of money and lacked any intrigue that would hold your interest. Not only that, this series was the most vulgar, crude, and disgusting dialog with language that would make a sailor blush. It appears the director felt it important to lace every conversation with sewage for maximum shock effect. The effect it had on me was to retrieve the DVD and throw it in the trash. I knew it was rated R but I would give it a R5 if I could for maximum worthlessness. I have an Army background so I can tolerate some trash .... but every 4th word?? No thanks. Had we not been on vacation Amazon would have gotten it back. Disgusting ........"
3,Fast and in new condition.,Ordered on a Friday night and recieved the product on Monday morning.The item was well packed. No problems.
1,Crap!!!!!!,"Too grim, too depressing!And there's a lot of bad language!I also think that the bad language expressed in this production was not as real as some people might say it was for that time period!But excepting bad language in this production is one thing, but it doesn't necessary mean that it makes the production any more worthy of being a hit show.Also the other thing I didn't like about the show was in how badly they treated women.Women in the wild west were a rare commodity ,so they were often well respected and looked after, but in this depiction there was nothing but disrespect! So how real was this depiction??Not very. Give this a miss!After seeing the first five episodes I can now see why this never won any awards.I never finished it myself and have gone on to better things! I am now very weary of those 5 star reviews that I come across all the time!A total waste of 74.00 dollars!"
1,Disappointed in Deadwood,"Acquaintances recommended this series because my husband and I like Westerns, but when we started watching, we were both so disappointed in the unrealistic language, that we could not concentrate on the story. If the producers of this show were trying to target a specific audience, then apparently they were aiming for 16 year old gang bangers. The ""F"" word is highly over rated and adds nothing to the actual story... except perhaps to explain the education level of the creators."
5,HBO Does it Again,"WOW! I can not say enough about this series. A co-worker recommended it. I was hesitant because I have never been interested in the western genre. It makes no difference with Deadwood. The acting, the story lines, the sets, all extrodinary. I without hesitation tell everyone and anyone I know to check it out."
1,"the series: deadwood, is NOT fashioned after the book by the same name.","i just wanted to say that i do not understand why anyone thought it necessary to bring THIS type of production to television..i've thought about this and from what i watched, this could have been filmed in a way that it would have had comparable impact but without subjecting the viewer to such a bird's eye view of impersonal but intimate sexual acts, and i ask you: how many times does it take to satisfy any director that ""we get it"" that men cursed back then and had little restraint when it came to common expression..as it is, my copies of all three seasons i have destroyed as they are not watchable to me, and i could not, in good conscience, pass them on to anyone else."
1,Vulgar language only part of the problem.,"This series is weird. I kept getting the feeling that each actor had his or her own director. Something just didn't connect. Such great actors, many are my favorites, but I had to force myself to watch four episodes before I had to stop. And I had all four seasons to watch. So much anger in these characters, it was hard to like anyone. Actors great, writers and director awful."
5,Probably one of the best shows set in the west ever,"I have to admit that I'm not a fan of westerns. That is until I watched Deadwood. However, it is so much more than a western. It is a very intricate show with an amazing cast of characters. The quasi historical aspect of the show makes it that more compelling. I suggest it strongly and it just gets better as the the series progresses. Another great show that with this historical aspect isRome - The Complete First Season. If you like excellent TV, then these shows are for you."
1,Should call it Trashwood!,"What an awful show, it really insults a persons intelligence, how difficult is it to write nothing but cussing over and over. Obviously the show is out to attract a very immature audience that thinks cursing is cool. Stay far away from TRASHWOOD!!"
3,Light Green,"This green pen color is okay. It is very light. The pen is good quality and writes well, but the color is hard to read since it is so light."
4,One of my favorite pens,"BIC Ultra Round Stic Grip Ball Point Pens are my favorite for everyday writing. The green color is fun. I like the lighter green instead of a darker shade, it seems to stand out more, though I would use this pen primarily for writing short notes or editing. These pens always seem to write smooth, don't dry out within weeks like other pens and are comfortable to hold. I wish I had seen the purple color earlier."
1,Can't get it to work.,I can't get this thing to work on 3 different WinXP PC's. They all recognize it but the software that came with it refuses to pull the pictures from it.Tech support line has been a constant busy signal since Christmas morning when the wife opened it.
4,Cool but Sketchy,"Awesome little camera--just don't depend on it for capturing great 4 megapixel shots you can print out in poster size color. It's a small camera and so is the resolution. What it's perfect for is capturing moments that would otherwise go unrecorded because you didn't want to lug a mid-sized (or even compact) camera around. This thing is TINY.The downside is that it's easy to lose pics if the battery drains and it's even easier to get a blurry shot if you've got a shaky hand. Patience when shooting in good light and a careful eye on the battery meter are needed. Though I only got about 50 shots with the included battery, I have taken well over a hundred with the Energizer I popped in and it's still going."

2,George and the Virgin,"There were some pretty funny moments in this book but it was bordering on stupid rather than funny some of the time. I did laugh out loud 3 or 4 times but when it came to the romance part of the book it was hard to switch off that mood to really care if they got together or not. The many, many interrupted love scenes got very, very annoying."
4,wow brings back memories,"Read this over twice in 1971, while on summer vacation in Wichita, ksNow able to find it and give to my son for xmas......... delivered on time and in great shape, ordering another for my bookshelve, since its not in kindle form....lol"
1,SINBAD: NOTHIN' BUT THE FUNK,I DID NOT LIKE THIS DVD. IT WAS NOT FUNNY. NOT LIKE SINBAD: SON OF A PREACHER MAN OR SINBAD: AFROS AND BELLBOTTOMS.
1,$22 for 6 episodes? No Thanks!,Season 1 is only 6 episodes. Don't get tricked and think you are buying a whole season. This shouldn't cost more than $8-10. Insane.
1,very inane,"it is stupid, just not my kind of humor? Or is it humor ? Guess is is for some people, just don't like it."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"Save your money. Really. The only thing redeeming about this show is Rasheeda Jones. This show is unfunny and tries to be like The Office but is just a waste of time. Time that you'll never, ever get back."
4,Fun series,"If you like Office, you are definitely going to like Parks and Recreation. Parks and Recreation is much more fun than Office. Many people don't like Office, because of the ""dry humor"" and different style of narration. These series are very similar style as Office, but not as boring. Even the environment is similar. There is much more going on in Parks and Recreation than in Office. I think most actors in this show are really good and entertaining."
3,Amazing Sounding Headphones but super uncomfortable,"These headphones are just as other reviewers describe them. They sound amazing. There made in the U.S.A and there made well. The problem is after listening to them for more then 20 minutes my ears hurt because they are so uncomfortable. I wish I could keep them but as of now theres nothing I can do to make them not hurt. I even called grado, was able to get a representative on the phone right away but there was really nothing she could do. Im going to try out some beyerdynamics and see how they feel/sound. Good Luck with them if you decide to purchase them and hopefully they dont hurt your ears!"
3,Just Not My Cup of Tea,"I purchased these cans to replace my Sennheiser HD 595s. The 595s are outstanding 'phones, but they cracked in exactly the same place that many others have experienced. I had heard good things about the Grados and took the chance.I liked the sound of the Grados. It's more up-front and brighter than the 595s. But, I found myself immediately disliking the on-the-ear cups. Not only did I not like the way they sat, I really disliked the hard, scratchy composition of the cups themselves. They felt like they were made out of some cheap foam. Plus, the general appearance of these cans is similar to what we used back in grade school in the sixties. I just expected more than I got from Grado.So, I have returned these cans and ordered what I really wanted in the first place, the Sennheiser HD 650s and a good amp and DAC."
4,Worth the money,"Not a whole lot of usable ideas but that's perhaps because I have been keeping up with information. Still, a very worthwhile book."
5,"Good, Fast, Cheap... Fujitsu makes it easy to pick ALL Three!","Ever since Visioneer stopped making their Paperport sheet feed scanner for Mac; I've be at a loss to replace that scanner with one that would do the job without taking up all my desktop and or taking a long time per page. Now comes Fujitsu and NOT ONLY have my ALL prayers have been answered but this machine is really FAST. Look at the pages per minute and you still will be amazed at how fast the stack, yes stack, of pages move through the machine ZOOM ZOOM ZOOM! Set up was simply inserting the CD driver, clicking on it and restarting my Mac. Once you see this in action you will become a believer. I scanned a 7 full page application and it all became only 1.2 MB in PDF format, which was easy to email! THANK YOU Fujitsu, my desktop and empty filing cabinets love you."
2,Strong +'s injured by not-infrequent paper jams,"I love the basic design, great hardware/software linkage, and software interface of this Mac-happy scanner. However, I value my time too much to babysit the feed mechanism of the unit I received last week. It inconsistently graps multiple pages as other reviewers have disclosed. So, if you're scanning a 10-page doc and it misses one somewhere along the way, have you really accomplished anything? No. You must either try the whole thing again (with likely the same result), or you must figure out what page(s) is missing, scan it separately, and go thru a simple yet not expedient Acrobat process to insert the omitted page. In the end, this machine made it +90% of the way to being a really great product, but the shortcoming fouls half the machine's overall utility. Swing a little bit harder next time Fujitsu."
1,This book is proof that dogmatic sexism is alive and well...,"Dr. Dobson explicates a bigoted theme of conservative ideology and blatant sexism in the guise of trying to justify social problems. In an attempt to explore contemporary social and gender issues, Dobson lays out a very dry account of where, he claims, the feminine situation should be in the modern Christian world. At one point he even analogizes a woman's role in society to a horse wita bit in its mouth. The underbelly of the book contains blatant racist tones. I find this book appaling, not only to the liberal audience but to anyone even remotely concerned with social justice."
1,Do NOT waste your money,"There MUST be better core ball videos out there! Karen Garcia (the main actor) starts off by stating that as we age, our sight and hearing diminish. She then proceeds to speak almost in slow motion. I kept thinking she would start speaking normally, and was horrified to find out that that was the way the entire ""beginner"" section was presented! And this is TRULY for a first time, never- exercised-before beginner. The DVD changes actors for the challenging section, but that girl is really just interested in her hair. It's annoying because each segment (arms, legs, abs...) is just a few minutes long and doesn't run continuously, so you need to stop and click the remote to get to the next segment. I hate this DVD."
1,Absolutely Boring,This dvd is for someone who hasn't exercised.This is not challenging.Don't waste your money or time on it.There are better ones.
5,It's Turtle Wax brand -- quality product,"I know the brand well, and Amazon had the perfect price without me having to go down to Pep Boys on a busy Saturday. Just a little in a bucket goes a long way. I should get a lot of washes out of this buy."
3,Stupid squirt cap,"The product is great but the container with its STUPID squirt cap that seems to away shoots out a table spoon or more each time you squeeze the bottle is annoying.Product 5 stars, container zero stars"
4,3 yr old loves it!,My 3 yr old is a fan of everything space related and he uses these figurines with all of his other space toys. Keeps him busy for hours.
1,Big dissapointment,"This book was written so that the authors could make money. There is no science behind it, although the authors pretend that it be the case. So sad that more and more money is being invested by people that don't know any better on books and programs that simply do not work. Reviewing the scientific literature on EQ will show that it is a mirage."
4,"It's a game, not a book.",This is actually a game and not a book. It's kind of fun. There are nine different squares with heads and tails of different colored penguins on each of the four sides. The object of the game is to match up the squares into one big square in which all the heads and tails match up. It sounds a lot easier to do than it actually is; family members have been severely frustrated after working on this game for over an hour. An entertaining and puzzling way to spend some time.
1,Too Small,This item really is a joke. The image shown online makes it seem bigger than it really is. The remote does not work and one of the speaker lights is out. The only good thing is that it got here fast.
5,Made her day!!!!,"My mom had this book several years ago and loaned it to someone. She never got it back. Recently she wanted to give a copy of this book to another young lady that put herself through college, struggling all the way. This lady faced many difficults through the years but stayed focused on her dream.This book arrivied to us in perfect condition. My mom gave her the book yesterday, and the lady told her that she got hired the day before. She will be a history teacher at a local school. Mom said it was a beautiful moment as both stood there in tears.I would definately buy from this seller again. Be blessed."
4,Bad idea that works.,"What a ridiculous idea but I just can't help watching it every time it's on. The plot stays squarely on track with little deviation which can't do if it's going to work. It moves so fast, one has little time wonder ""hey, could that happen?"" It's quite the thrill ride and will make you pause when it's an unknown number on your cell."
1,"Blu-Ray, and no captioning?","The rating is for the Amazon product, not the movie. If I were rating the movie, I'd give it five stars for being a fun suspense thriller to watch on a lazy day.About the product, I have no issues with the DVD or the casing. I do have issues with the fact that this is a Blu-Ray and there is no captioning. Even TV shows from the 1980s have captioning today on DVDs; there is no excuse for a Blu-Ray of a 2005 movie to not have captioning. Especially since the regular DVD version does have captioning. Get your act together and put subtitles on this product. You're isolating an entire group of people that are deaf or hard of hearing."
2,"Entertaining overall, but flawed","This movie is ok if you are looking to pass some time, but not that great. The premise is fine, but why this kid couldn't just find any of a hundred cops to pass this call to is beyond me. And on a phone like that you can bet he has 3-way calling, put her on hold, call the cops and patch her through - DONE! And no more worrying about if he is going to have reception, which he has everywhere EXCEPT the police station. Nice. Of course, that wouldn't take 2 hours, so naturally that is not what he does. Instead he runs all over creation, breaking a bunch of laws in the process that seem to go unnoticed, even stealing a person's car at gunpoint, and all the while staying on the line with the leading lady, who's acting in this was so painfully bad her crying scenes made me want to cry too. The ending was done OK, not great, and certainly not unique, but fair enough to get this movie a 2 star reveiw instaed of only 1."
5,Statham Fan,We loved this movie. Lots of interesting action with lots of great stars and plenty of twists to keep you interested.
5,Cellular,Don't hold your breath too long! It was a show-stopper! I did not get quite so effected by the second time I saw the story!
2,Lots of action for nothing,"Silly, technologically unsavvy and overlong, Cellular is almost a good turn-off-your-brain thriller. It's just that it is so hard to turn your brain off that much! Basinger ""phones in"" her performance (sorry). But you think: She is an Oscar winner!? Nobody else is really of any consequence. How the Great William H. Macy -- who has the only thing to offer in this film -- ended up here is a the biggest mystery."
1,Lame beyond belief,"With all the talented actors that are in this movie, you would think it would be better. Unfortunately it's not. Can't comprehend why William H. Macy and Jason Statham would even consider doing a movie like this. (Kim Basinger I understand)If you like movies that insult your intelligence, then this is for you. But really, don't waste your time or your money watching this lame flick."
3,It was good,"Kim Basinger's acting in this is absoutely horrible. That said, this wasn't a bad movie. I thought the concept was very good. And I really liked the hero guy. There was some good action. And umm...that's it. If you're looking for a movie to rent and you can't find any you really wanna see give this movie a try."
1,good idea but bad execution,I bought this for my daughter last year for xmas and we got to play with it about twice before it fell apart.I really liked the idea of the pattern designs especially for my then 2 year old who just likes to paint mush lol. when we used the rollers to make the square designs it really didn't work. when the paint was on the roller it didn;t roll very well. I tried to dilute the the paint with water so the roller would work better but the sponges just didn't hold up.
4,So much fun...,"We purchased this BINGO after returning from a camping trip where we played 'Candy Bar Bingo'...since then we have played it every Sunday after dinner...the kids enjoy it and the Grandparents too! The quality is decent, although the balls seem to fall off the railing on the way down sometimes, but other than that it seems to be of good quality for the price...we also bought the extension pack for more cards...all in all we hare happy with the purchase."
4,Great Bingo set but it doesn't fit the price.,"The package arrived faster than the estimated date. But I was a little disappointed with quality of the cardboard shuttered cards; some are hard to slide open and close, it's not durable, and teared with a little usage. The balls are not round and the letters can be hard to see. All in all, the set will keep your friends and family entertain but the bingo set doesn't fit the price($35 at most)."
3,fun!,"I think that this product is definitely fun but there are a few things that could be fixed. For instance the Bingo Cards that come with it will always have the same numbers. You can't put in a different card or anything.The other thing is that lid of that rotating thingy where the balls go back into keeps opening. So I have to modify it with a rubber band, which is not optimal."
3,Flaws in the cards,The entire set is OK. Some of the balls do not have numbers printed on them very well. Had to go over them with markers and they don't look at good as they should. some of the cards do not work....red slider appears to be inserted crooked and will not cover the numbers.
3,It was okay,"The cage and board were really nice. I checked out the game before using it. I did have to use a marker to darken some on the numbers on the wooden balls, because some of them were light. The cards are cheaply made and I would not recommend wasting any money on those at all. We had to order a different type of bingo card after we played our first game and realized just how cheaply made the cards were."
4,I hate taking English,My English 111 class uses this book. From a student's percpective this book is ok because the essays aren't too long. Some of them are pretty interesting. None of them are that good though.
2,Where was the final scream??,"Disappointing. Not my favorite Lisa Jackson book. I read murder mysteries because I enjoy the writers' interpretation of how the criminal mind works. There was almost none of that in this book. The chararcters and the love story were interesting, just not what I was looking for."
2,Too Long!,"This was the first book by Lisa Jackson I have read. I found this story to be much more of a ""romance novel"" than mystery. I found that throughout the book, such obvious clues were given, there weren't very many surprises. I had the whole ending figured out about half way through. Ms. Jackson has many fans, however, so I am sure this one book does not speak for all of them. I will read another before I make up my mind about this author."
2,The Final Scream,I was very disappointed in the condition of the book-front cover ripped- looks like the book had gotten wet. Will not purchase again. I would like for them to be honest-not to say it is in good condition when it is not. I can't even take to the used book store because of the condition of the book.
1,this was really bad.,i thought i was getting a new book not a copy from a old one that should have been left alone. i liked lisa jackson books but this turned me off.
5,By George! It Works!,"Our first George Foreman appliance was the two slice toaster shown in the product picture of theGeorge Foreman GR36BWC Jumbo Size Plus Grill, Silver with Double Bonus. We were very satisfied with the toaster and thought we would give this grilling machine a try. I'm glad we did. This is a great little indoor grill when just cooking for one or two people. We have used it for hamburgers and hotdogs and have been very satisfied with the tasty results. Drains the fat but leaves the flavor! Clean up is a breeze. Great for those days when it's too hot, rainy or cold to grill outside. ~ The Boss"
2,Temp alerts are preset and can't be changed. Returned,"In contrast to what I read in another review here before purchasing the thermometer, I found that the high and low temp alerts are preset to (if I remember right) 76 and 82 or so. This is not workable for me (I'm in Tucson and keep my house at 85 or so in the summer) so I returned it. Part of the description also talks about 4 alert features. I couldn't for the life of me figure out what this means. That each of the two alerts turns both on and off?"
1,THIS MOVIE HELLA SUCKS!!,"Thank goodness it was on tv and free vs. me buying it. I wouldn't recommend purchasing it. If you can see it on tv, do so just to see what I'm talking about. I like Marques & Omarion, but they should have chosen better scripts to showcase their acting abilities. The part that really kills me is that Marques' character is walking around with a police shot gun and doesn't use it on the killer. Hella STUPID movie!!!!!!"
1,One of the Dumbest Movies I've Ever Seen,"Do NOT spend $22 on this movie. I got a second-hand copy for $5 and I wish I could return it. I really seriously wanted to like this movie but it's like the writer went out of his/her way to make me hate it. The charachters in this movie are some of the dumbest people ever, and you just hope that the killer would go ahead and find them, kill them, and put them out of MY misery.This movie is complete garbage PLEAAASSSEEE do not spend $22 on this. The bad part is I'm actually watching the movie as I write this. Couldn't wait."
3,It contains some interesting tips but not the best C++ book,"I have read this book because it was recommended by Scott Meyer in his bookMore Effective C++: 35 New Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designsand he was saying that this book was showing what C++ looked like on LSD. This book certainly contains interesting ideas and it demonstrate that the author has an exceptional creativity as a C++ user but Mr. Coplien best quality is not teaching in my opinion. To me, the text is opaque and hard to understand when the author is using terms such as ""orthodox canonical form""."
3,Not as advertised,"Beware that the monkey is not painted. The photo shows that the monkey is painted to match the one in family guy. However, it is glow in the dark green, it you know what I mean. It is completely greenish yellow, not brown like in the picture."
3,Basic enough,Worth a try for beginners but be very patient and likely better to start this out as a group or with friends along similar interest
3,stretch & relax,"I found the abrupt music stoppage for the voice over interupted the flow a tiny bit. Achieved a good stretch, but discovered Kundalini Yoga and prefer the more upbeat music & movement. But if you are looking for soft music and stretching this is a good DVD to get started with."
1,Waste of Money,"This dvd is awful. There is no yoga practice to speak of. Such a wonderful teacher, yet she only does a handful of poses. She spends most of the time just arranging her props. There is no flow at all. Don't waste your moneny."
1,Horrible waste of money.. find another DVD,"There is absolutely no flow to changing poses.. it will have you up then down then up.. each pose is basically a scene change. Maybe the only benefit it has was the breathing exercises, other than that, it's not worth the money."
3,Works okay,"The sticky flap doesn't stay stuck for very long but box tape fixes that.The peel tab to open the mailer is weaker than the cardboard so it just breaks off, requiring one to open it with a knife or scissors.Other than that, they are okay."
1,Bait and Switch,I previously purchased this product and it was exceptional. This time around it was an inferior Chinese version of the item. They have at least now updated the photo so that you mat not expect to still get the quality item of days passed.
4,Solid Cardboard CD Holder/Mailer,"This product is exactly what I hoped for, no more, no less. Solid plain cardboard CD holder/mailer. It's not going to withstand someone trying to break it, but it is plenty tough enough to withstand dropping or things set on top of it."
4,"good quality, but not meant for standard jewel cases","I just received an order of these and am pleased with the quality of them for the price. However, if you're thinking of using these to mail standard jewel cases, these aren't a good option. The cases don't really fit. These mailers are best for either slimline cases or paper CD/DVD sleeves.Contrary to some previous reviews, the mailers I received do have a pull tab for opening as well as a wide adhesive strip. If you order these and receive them without a pull tab, you might have received the wrong item."
3,Less In-depth than I had hoped,"I'm not a doctor, nor do I play one on TV. That being said, I was disappointed with this book's lack of depth. Many of the descriptions read like an unfinished thought. If you have any previous interest in ""Strange Diseases and Conditions,"" you already know too much to count this book as a worthy investment. Not unlike a previous reviewer, I too was dissapointed by the copious references to websites. I am also curious as to why the author did not illustrate more examples, rather than directing the reader elsewhere. On the upside, it was a shockingly easy and quick read."
3,I got this for my mom...,"she is into these types of books.After reading it, she said it left her wanting. Not high on the substance more on the sensational."
3,The heart of Catalonia.,"A brief sample history of Barcelona and its effect on art, architecture, and the people. Hughes fell in love with this city and became a frequent visitor to the second largest city in Spain. Barcelona is indeed a famous city and one of the holdouts to the Franco regime in the Spanish CIvil War. Perhaps Hughes through his wording tried to convey his love of the city in his writings. However this book came across as a sketchy summary history of this great city.This is an OK read on this great city. If you want more history, check out Hughes earlier book on this city."
3,a decent book,This book gives a good summary of theory as well as algorithm (in C code written to illustrate the algorithm rather than optimal performance). If you are looking for a high-level book that throughly explains theory then this is not the one. If you want theory and some example code then this is a good buy. The bibliography at the end of each chapter gives great pointers of where to go for more detailed theory. I would recommend this to students in image processing or professionals who have to acquire image processing skills.My only major complaint is the low quality example pictures. They are small and all in black and white. Otherwise I would have given this book 4 stars.
3,Corny Foreign Film,"This is a foreign film that is fun, action packed, corny but yet it keeps you wondering and at the edge of your seat through out the whole movie."
4,Fun movie,"This movie is a lot of fun. It gets better and better as it goes on. It was very entertaining. I am not an expert on Japanese film, but I must admit the movie was very good. I think it should be a more mainstream film. definitly buy this movie."
2,"Misleading, or just lazy?","This is not a review of the movie, but of the Bluray itself. If you're into this new wave of Japanese splatter flicks then you know what to expect, and Tokyo Gore Police is amongst the best of its kind.However, Media Blasters has dropped the ball with this release. Or, rather, someone in their art department is just incredibly lazy. The back cover has been copied and pasted from their 2 disc DVD edition. This Bluray release is ONE disc, not two. Furthermore, the listed bonus material (TGP short films, behind the scenes) are not on the disc. What you do get is a trailer for the film and for other Tokyo Shock releases.The transfer is expectedly average (these cheaply shot and quickly made features are never going to sparkle), and there are DTS-HD 5.1 audio tracks in both Japanese and English.It just boggles the mind that these kinds of oversights happen in this day and age. For shame, Media Blasters."
3,Cookbook,"This is the sequel to the excellent DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web. It is merely a cookbook of techniques, whereas the first book is an outstanding introduction to an advanced subject.This book is worth leafing through to find items of interest but it does not advance the state of the art in the way the first book did."
1,Mourn the passing of Entombed,"The legends who brought us Wolverine Blues truly are no more. I encourage you to gather your thoughts and prayers for them, so that their lives in the hereafter may be pleasant with the knowledge that they will NOT be remembered for this album."
2,uhhh.....,"What happened to Entombed? Their first few albums were heavy and brutal. Now, they're punk-ish hard rock. This album is terrible. The worst cd i've ever bought."
1,"after the Clandestine, europian death is DEAD.","gag and gig is different, just as DM fans can tell a good musical composition from bads. they want rock and roll now, and how about a country music next time? they won't, because they don't want others to laugh, but what do they know when the fans who endured upto wolverine or maybe shoot straight are now do not even want to talk about them? Clandestine was created when the average age of those genius was around 16, and they must have used up all their creativity. wolverine was just a joke, to make their fans even more thirsty for the majesty's another magnificent counter punch, and...sad. slayer's undisputed album was a tribute, six feet under's ACDC covers were their honor, and this is an insult, not even a joke."
1,Weak effort,"I received this book entirely by mistake! I had ordered a different book by Steve Kehaya on the SKS. When I contacted the seller about the mix-up, he graciously apologized, and refunded my purchase, saying to do with this book as I wish (since the price of shipping is so high compared to the value of the book).Now that I have the two books to compare side by side, it's glaringly obvious how lacking this book is in depth and objectivity. While it does provide accurate basic information on a few common varieties, it doesn't even try to cover the many variations on the SKS, nor does it give much detail into the workings of the gun's parts.If you're on a *very* tight budget and just want a basic guide to your SKS carbine, try to pick this up for under ten bucks (including postage). Otherwise, for just a few more dollars, treat yourself to the Steve Kehaya book. Really. It's about twice as long, better written, much better researched, and much better illustrated."
5,A Book Worth Reading!,"Being of Scottish descent; I was thrilled with reading a book with a Scottish theme. As I read more and more of the book, that was replaced with a genuine interest in Landy. I have to say, I don't know about the other author mentioned in earlier reviews and to me, it doesn't matter. I take each book for what they are---I read each book and decide on if I like it or not. I personally loved the book and can't wait for more material on Landy. Haven seen an inside peek, I know I won't be disappointed in the sequel. I must say that Mark has done a great job with this book and I wish him all the best in the future! I too hope it is discovered by the masses and is made into a movie. Way to go Mark~"
2,Dissapointed.,"I was SO disappointed with this novel. You would think the author would not put up a front of this actually being set during season 6, when they obviously did not take the time to WATCH season 6. The characterization of Spike is ridiculous and grossly out of character. I'm sick and tired of seeing Spike on the cover only to read such a terrible interpretation of his character.I do NOT recommend the novel.Here's to hoping someone gets the good sense to write a spike-centric novel that *gasp* is actually in character."
1,very disappointing,I was horribly disappointed by this book. The author obviously never watched the 6th season and it shows. She wrote Spike out of character for this season. I was really hoping that this book would show the developement Spike has gone through the past year but it was neglected. Also are we really suppose to believe that after 4 years Buffy is still not over Angel? I felt that the authtor made Buffy look pathtic in that aspect.
1,Absolute dreck!,"This book is *nothing* like the series. It's set in Season 6, after ""Dead Things"", and Spike says in the book that he can't bite Buffy??? He knew by then that they chip didn't work on her! Spike never wanted to kill Dawn. Spike is not the evil creature that he's been painted in this awful dreck! He spent the entire summer taking care of Dawn with no hope of impressing Buffy, because he wanted to keep his promise to ""a lady"".I suggest that Ms. Holder actually *watch* the show that she's writing about before attempting another one of these books.I'm a fan of BtVS, but first and foremost I'm a SPIKE fan, and I won't buy any more of these things unless they paint Spike as he really is: either on the way to redeemed (from Season 6) or redeemed vampire with a soul that he is now!High School is finished.Angel and Buffy are finished.Spike and Buffy 4 eva!!!!!!!"
5,A Buffy Classic,"I have read quite a few Buffy books and this is the one that stands out. Buffy fights Jack the Ripper, can it get any better? I recommend this book to all Buffy fans."
1,Write about what you know.,"Stories written from the heart have universal appeal. Ann Cameron is a white middle-class woman from Wisconsin. When an author tries to write from the perspective of someone else's ethnicity, the writing can seem contrived and ersatz. That's what's wrong with these stories.Why does the author pretend to be African-American? Why not write about being a little girl in Wisconsin?"
3,Good lighting but cheap brackets.,"I was pumped to have these fog lights. I love the look and color of them. I needed them bad for the mountain fog.But after spending two hours, when installing them on my bumper one fog light fell to the ground and cracked. The overall material is glass so once they hit concrete they shatter, its a given. As for the brackets, i will say that if bolts aren't aligned on each side of the fog light like they strip easily. The instructions for wiring is pretty easy but it takes some research to figure out which hi or low beam you have to splice into on your own car. It comes with a relay explained very well on with point it goes on. Overall because of the cheap brackets and glass material that could easily be broke on a rock from another car, i give it 3 stars. I say go with some fogs that have guards over them."
2,Big Disappointment!,"I received this as a gift. I was real excited and ready to use all the features. However, my excitement was short lived. In the three weeks I have had it, I have gone through at least 5 pairs of batteries. It seemed as if every other time I tryed to turn it on, the batteries were dead. Also, I never did figure out how to work the PC synchronization. I tried from home and work and never could get it to work. Even after printing out the 300 or so pages of documentation. I finally decided mine must be defective since it was eating batteries so fast and I was hardly using it, so I took it back to the store and got a full refund. I would not recommend."
2,Not that impressed,"Okay....so perhaps I'm a little gullible when it comes to product claims, especially when I wanted something to work so badly. I purchased this product in hopes that I would be able to spend the night with my boyfriend WITHOUT ending a romantic night with the inevitable ""raising of the roof"" snoring sound I so frequently produce :) Well, not so much. For the first hour of sleep, it seemed to help.....after that, right back to the rib punches and the ""roll over"".....""you're snoring""....that I endure. I was really disappointed in the performance of the product. If anyone has found a product that works better, I'd love to hear about it because this one was NOT it. Happy snoring! Save your money on this one!"
2,not much fun,"The toy does what it says it should do. But the ""tornado"" doesn't last for more than 3 seconds. Not much fun. I would not purchase it again."
1,Never got to use it,This toy arrived broken. Sent as a gift and was disappointed that when they got it they didnt even get to enjoy it. I am sure it ended up in the trash.
1,A jar with liquid and sparkles,Should have listened to the other member stating it last 1-2-3 seconds. Should have just purchased a photo book instead. This was a waste of hard earned money.
2,...,the package was wet when we recieved it. the top was cracked open. thankfully only about a quarter of the liquid leaked out i super glued the crack and wrapped it anyways. just a stocking stuffer. tornado looks cool for about 2 seconds after shaking it. then quickly dissapears. could have something to do with there not being enough liquid i'm not sure. too bad oh well. my 4 year old won't know the difference.
4,Just what I expected,This item was what I expected and has been very useful to me as a desk item. Students have used it as have I.The item in question arrived in a timely fashion and was in great condition when it did.I would gladly do business with this seller again in the future.
1,Don't Waste Your Money !,"I purchased this for my son, who loves studying severe weather. It worked exactly ONCE. It made one funnel cloud, then it burped a large air bubble inside and that was it, no matter which way it was turned, spun , or shaken. Now, it is just a tube of water with glitter that does NOTHING. And of course, it costs more to ship back for a refund than the value of the item itself. As I said....JUNK."
3,It is a nice gift and fun at first,"This is a fun gift to give someone especially to someone who lives in a place that does not normally see tornadoes. The only thing I found is that when you first shake it and it makes a tornado, it really looks like one but the more you shake it, it does not make one easily and it just is a messed up tornado and doesn't look much like one. So, it is easy to lose interest in it right away. Kids like for something like this to work all the time but it does not make a good tornado after the first one and you have to set it aside and come back later for it to make another good tornado"
4,J.Lo - Remixed by Thunderpuss!,"I have previously dismissed Jennifer Lopez's single ""I'm Gonna Be Alright"" as a watered-down and formulaic hip-hop flavored tune featuring Nas. However, this version of the single has two remixes of the album cut ""I'm Alive."" This track, co-written by Lopez's soon-to-be-ex hubby Cris Judd, gets a discocentric remix by the ever-trusty DJ team of Thunderpuss (Chris Cox and Barry Harris). The end result is a winning groove that could be one of this summer's club anthems. So, if you're going to get this single, skip the versions of ""I'm Gonna Be Alright,"" and go directly to the Thunderpuss remixes. Those two tracks alone justify the purchase of this CD single."
2,J.Lo in creative decline,"J.lo's recent work has shown a steady, creative decline. Her latest album was bland and un-inspired. And formulaic in that J.Lo sings the hook over a sampled beat, and brings in a few guest rappers for the remix.J.Lo's debut album, On the 6, Was a solid effort and sounded fresh. The tracks with guest rappers sounded interesting.The afforementioned decline began with her second album, Where the majority of boardwork was helmed by love-him-or-hate-him P.Diddy, it had a few great moments but was sub-par overall.""I'm gonna be alright"" continues this streak. The simple lyrics lag on, and the music was built around a Club Nouveau sample, and ""I'm gonna be alright"" makes uncreative use of it. The Luniz sample of the hook was superior.J.Lo gets a little help from her friends, rappers 50 Cent and Nas, they're presence doesn't help at all. Although the latter is up on his history, mentioning Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe.This single is nothing special."
2,Half way through ... just finished...same review,"Guess I'm too spoiled with ""Horse Soldiers"" and ""Lone Survivor"" and ""Unbroken"" ... I am half way through this book and bored to death. Way too much background information and no action or war story whatsoever...a very dry history of the Mountain Division troops...maybe when they finally get to Italy and into the war the story will pick up.OK, because I lived in Colorado for 25 years I found the information about the post-war development of Colorado ski resorts interesting. But honestly, this is a book only for those intimately involved in the 10th Mountain Division's history. And to make matters worse there were NO maps to help the reader understand where and why the action was taking place. Big mistake!I'm kinda glad I read the book but could not recommend it to anyone...too many better books out there with too little time to read them all!!"
4,"Perfect for documents, not so good for pictures","Perfect for printing documents and reports (including images), but it doesn't have the same quality as the branded one when printing photos."
3,Beautifully presented,"I ordered the pendant with trepidation since I like to be able to ""see"" what I buy. The picture convinced me to purchase it however. It was boxed very well; shipped immediately BUT the pendant was almost colorless. It was MUCH paler than shown and the chain on which it is pictured is not the one I received though it was acceptable. I am pleased but more clarification would have been appreciated."
4,emeral cut auqamarine pendant,The necklace is very beautiful - exactly as pictured- also very fast shipping. Thank you!
5,Great Book by a Great Writer,"This is a truly wonderful book about a truly great tv show, easily one of the greats of all time. What makes this book great is the creepy humor of Gabe Hudson, who wrote the best parts but doesn't take credit here. Readers who like this book and all those different documents from the characters on the show should definitely drop everything to read Gabe Hudson's Dear Mr. President."
4,a must have for a Six Feet Under devotee,"The book probably doesn't stand on its own, but works great as an extension of the beloved TV show.Scrapbooks are so neat! It's the format of the future."
3,Not complete!,"While this is a great book for the Six Feet Under fan - which I just became as of 2006-2007 - after renting the discs - and then finally buying the complete set (for only $95!), I just looked thru this book last night and while it's a fascinating and a more ""complete"" look at the Fisher clan (and also fills in a few things you might haven't known while watching the show), my only complaint is that they should have put this book out after the show is over, since it pretty much covers only up to season 4 - when Lisa disappears. So much more happened after that, and it would have been nice to have a ""complete"" book that covered EVERYTHING up until the last episode - including ""momentos"" of things that happened in their future."
1,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"I decided to give this film a chance, because it really is an intriguing story. Set in 1969, in a small town in Florida. An alcoholic father has abandoned his wife and child. The child is slow and has all kinds of problems, so the mother is forced to open up a business. In 1969 what kind of business does every small southern town need? You guessed it, a sex shop! It's a different plot and seemed like it would be a very interesting story, but looks can be deceiving. They hire writers to make the ""official"" description of the movie, so it sound great and you'll go see it, and in this case they got me. This has got to be one of the slowest and most pointless movies I have ever seen. Everyone is portrayed as stupid, the film is choppy and makes no sense, and on top of that it's just a total bore! They fooled me, don't let them fool you! Avoid this one!"
5,Lots of Fun,"I got this for my 9 year old son who begged me for it. He pulled it up on web, walked me over to the computer and handed me my purse. ;-)Shipping time was pretty reasonable..3 days, but he would say it took forever. It has definitely been worth it. He and my 7 year old are constantly writing messages to each other and they actually share something for a change. (They have to if he wants the other to de-code his message). So far, it's been working great. The ink lasts a long time and the light is still working great too after a month of constant use. This is perfect for kids in their age range. Not so sure about the educational value, but it's great for teaching sharing. Highly recommended!"
2,Okay CD,"I was a little disappointed with the versions of several of the songs, but it is what it is. It is a party CD of soccer-related songs."
5,"What can I say, it's Alka-Seltzer","Performs as advertised. Worked well on my cold. Handled my congestion well-enough to let me sleep. What can I say, it's Alka-Seltzer, a product we've known for years."
2,All Material in this Book is in their Site,"All Material of this book in their Site ,You can check their site and save your money ,i found out that after i bought it and it is 117 pages only"
5,"Detroit Escalator Company, The - Black Buildings","On The Detroit Escalator Co.'s second full album, Black Buildings, Neil Ollivierra manages once again to coax emotion from machines. The bass seems a bit more pronounced, as if he were constructing solid foundations for these buildings -- but keep in mind that bass does not always translate into kick drums. ""No2,"" for instance, swims in the bass, but manages an ambient elegance. Mark my words, the compositions are solid. ""Manual Transmission"" thrums with beauty; ""Gathering Light"" continues the ambient beauty. ""Fractal (In)"" glistens and shimmers; ""Float"" is pretty much self-explanatory. The Detroit Escalator Co. makes one-of-a-kind music. Just listen and you'll agree."
2,Rechargeable yet not powerful,I purchased this vac for easy clean up of my hardwood floors. I liked the fact that I could detach the handle and use on our pool table. Yet after a while the vac no longer held a charge and it was not convenient to vac with the cord.
1,I just can't vacuum the kitchen in 3 minutes...,"I bought the GoVac in May 07' to clean up in the kitchen everynight and I was very impressed at first. It had good suction power and lasted more then the 12 minutes that Bissell claimed. Now, only 4 months later, the fully charged GoVac lasted exactly 3 minutes and 23 seconds before there was a dramatic loss in suction power, to the point that it was not able to vacuum any crumbs at all. Spend your money on small corded shop vac instead. They last longer and you never have to worry about losing power halfway through the job."
1,Terrible,"This vacuum does not work at all. I bought it for quick pick-ups on hardwood -- cat hair, cat litter, dust bunnies. It just doesn't vacuum up *anything*. A complete piece of junk that I am going to throw away."
1,bad,I bought 11 DVDs on ebay at the same time as I bought these. They only cost $20 for 11 and arrived before Xmas. These took 7 seven weeks longer to arrive and each DVD cost $20.- so expensive for such bad service. I will never shop amazon again
3,"Good book, with caveats","First, I would say that overall this is a good book. Just that - not excellent, not inspiring, not... current. The techniques and principles mentioned in this book are applicable only if you really plan to throw out some of the cruft (with the predominance of OO languages such as Java, C++, Perl, Python and others, do we really need flowcharts?). Good logic and good structure are always required and this book gives you that - just remember there are other (better?) ways of doing design (UML anyone?). Also keep in mind that the way Warnier Orr is presented in this book deviates from the ""standard"" - so don't be surprised if you have some relearning to do."
3,Daughters Arise,"To be fair I haven't read the book from cover to cover. That said, I haven't read it cover to cover because it was a little overwhelming. Can a book have too much information? I was looking for a book that would walk me through a girls retreat weekend. This book provides many different possible ceremonies, and themes of the weekend. I didn't want to have to piece together the weekend. I wanted to have a curriculum planned out for me so I could focus on the girls instead of the paperwork. Also, many of the ceremonies felt a little ritualistic (think YaYa Sisterhood), no offence, just not my cup of tea. Over all, good info for those of you who 1)like ceremonies 2) have the time to research and prepare for them 3) like a lot of choices."
3,"Great story, supernatural distracting","I keep going back between a three and four star rating. I very much liked the overall story and chess match construct that framed the action and characters involvement in the plot. The characters were believable and the faith dialog weaved very well into the story.However, I found the supernatural elements unnecessary and a bit forced. The story could have excluded the snakes and apparitions entirely. I actually found myself getting confused by these elements and wondering why they were included - there was enough action, motive and plot without them. Dropping these elements while keeping everything else the same would have resulted in a more compact, engaging story."
3,"Good eps, but not worth it...","I bought the Chosen Collection for around 200. If you're a casual fan, then maybe Eight is Enough. But, ultimately, it's a better deal to just buy the show in a larger package, since buying them 8 at a time will cost you over 400 (about 144 eps in all, I believe) , in the end. (Yes, I realize that logic only works if the person intends to buy the entire show piecemeal.) You'd be better off, though, picking you're fave season and buying it cheap somewhere. But, you can't really go too wrong buying the set, especially if you're an interested novitiate to the Whedon-verses, and this will be a good introduction."
1,cheeky-ly dumb,"what are these girls supposed to be doing on the TV? they are the biggest JOKES ever.it took us time in england to actually believe they were real- i'd feel so stupid if i was one of them.they look so manufactured plus their song dosen't make sense (IT WAS WRITTEN BY THEIR 50 YR OLD MUM)E.G: ""we are the cheeky girls- u are the cheeky boys- touch my bum- ehh - cheeky cheeky""no wonder their fans fall between 3-10 yr olds. plus their voice is disgusting.If u allow their song in ur ears more than once, their voice will haunt U for the rest of your life. run as far as u can from anything CHEEKY."
2,Medicore from my view,"Dudley Boys vs. Nowinski, Rodney Mack 4/10Scott vs. Test 3/10IC Title Booker-T vs. Christian 5/10Tag Team Titles La resistance vs. Kane, RVD 4.5/10Goldberg vs. Chris Jerico 8/10Micheals vs. Flair 6/10HIAC Kevin Nash vs. HHH 5/10"
1,Don't buy this!,My shepard mix had the ball section of the toy ripped apart in less than 5 minutes. It is advertised as durable but it is not. Do not buy if your dog chews at all. If possible I would give it 0 stars.
1,Humunga tongue too large for small and medium sized dogs.,"I purchased this toy for my daughters dogs. They treated it like any chew toy. We did not get the results that were shown in the photo. Their little mouths do not fit around the ball portion of the 'tongue'. If you are purchasing this for photos, don't bother! Huge disappointment!"
5,A little masterpiece by one of the gay princes of 20th Century culture,"The gay and lesbian book discussion group read this novel in Feb 2007.I loved this novel but was worried about what the group would think - sometimes we can be harsh on ""erudite"" authors. Fortunately, we agreed that it's a 20th Century masterpiece, lost or ignored for some reason. We found much to discuss and praised its plot and plotting, characters and their development, and underlying gay sensibility (which might not be noted by a less queer reader - can you spot the moment Mrs. Cullen realizes that the narrator is gay? - we did!).Reading about Wescott and his position in 20th Century cultural life made us very happy to have discovered this fabulous author and want to read more."
1,on and on and on,"The writers style needs improvement. The chapters, what chapters, there are no chapters . The book goes on and on and on. It is a difficult book to put down and pick up. Again , no chapters and the characters are too sterile.This book is too classic for me or is a hawk eating dead pigeons a classic story. eugh!"
1,no response,"The lenox cake knife was for my daughters wedding. When we received it the server was badly tarnished. When I emailed the seller I received no response.Very disappointed. Will not buy from Amazon again,I feel I have no recourse"
3,Good introduction,"The book is easy to read, and suitable for those who want an introduction to network processors (NPs). My main gripe is that, for lecturers, it's very difficult, or impossible, to get your hand on network processors at a reasonable price to create a lab to run a course on NPs. Unless this is resolved, this book is a non seller!"
2,Mediocre first try,Three facts speak for themselves:1. The bibliography in the book is only four pages long.2. There is a 47-page dictionary used as a filler - the font size is such that there are only 8 definitions per page.3. There are 27 chapters in the book. Each one has a blank page and a title page. This is 54 pages of extra filler.
4,Good for light use,"I didn't have high expectations for these because of the low price, however they do cut fine for me. All are sharp, and I run a low rpm to keep the surface speed down to prevent burning the wood. Have had good results in red oak, white oak, pine, mahogany, particle board and baltic birch plywood. I do not use forstner bits a great deal so I'm fine with the quality of these and would recommend them to any light user."
3,You get what you pay for,"If you're looking for a cheap set of forstner bits, that's what you'll get.These bits are almost well made - up until the part where they're supposed to sharpen them at the factory. They aren't. The teeth are shaped, but not sharp. If you use them as-is, they will burn through the wood, but do not produce actual shavings or a clean cut. If you take a few minutes to hand sharpen the bit you want to use, it then does a decent job.It's really a case of ""you get what you pay for"" - what do you expect for $30?"
2,you get what you pay for,I have to agree with some of the other reviewers. These not not very well made. Most of the bits have nicks and/or burrs on them. You need to hand clean and sharpen these before you can use them. If you are looking for a range of bits for a one time use then this will be an affordable option. If you are looking for some bits that will be used regularly then you should rather buy high quality versions of the bits you need. Even the box is a throw away item. The lid did not align on my set and none of the bits fit in their proper places in the box.
4,A Nice Set To Have Around,"For the price, this is a good set to have around if you only use the once in a while. It fit the needs I have. If you use them everyday, then move up to the next level of quality. Fast Ship."
3,MLCS Forstner 16 Piece Bit Set,"Have lightly used, but this was a replacement set. It appears to be reliable and just above basic. If you work daily with Forstner Bits, I recommend buying upper scale. If you use ramdomly, these are it for the price. Larry"
3,"Well, the reality is wrong","Economics is growing into a profession that mostly enjoys itself in theoretical models. You can get a Nobel Prize even if your ""Theory of Value"" doesn't make any empirical sense. Yes, it's wonderful, great model, rigorous, unprecedented, but just have little to do with the reality. I was disappointed that it didn't even talk about China in any meaningful detail. Occam's Razor is at work only when it assumes less not more about the reality. This is simply not the case in this book. If you are good at math, it's relatively easy to apply to anything quickly with good results. But taking on something cultural requires a lot more. Yet it is culture that can bring one closer to reality. In short, this book should be judged by what's left after all the mathematical contents are stripped down. And if the reality still seems to be wrong, there is something big missing in the theory."
5,Love it! One of the funniest ever!!!,I bought the DVD for a gift. It's one of the funniest ever. Black shines on.
5,Hilarious as Usual,"What can I say? In my opinion, Lewis Black is the funniest comedian ever. Yeah, he uses a *whole lot* of swear words, but what a great way to work out your anger (just don't watch it with the kids!) I think this is one of his best DVDs, right up there with ""Red, White and Screwed""."
5,I love this man!,This was absolutely hilarious. Lewis Black has the best delivery and the best facial expressions. He reminds me of George Carlin.You must see this!
3,Lewis vs Carlin,"Lewis Black is good but if you want a real good time with a master stand up comedian, go for George Carlin's complaints and grievances show--hands down winner."
2,"nothing like the same perfume I had before, it doesn't smell nearly as good.","The Organza by Ginenchy for Women doesn't smell the same as my previous bottle. I wasextremely disappointed and would never order perfume again. Perhaps it is a knock-offon the original perfume, I have heard that is a problem when buying perfume on the internet.Dee"
1,Knock-off pad that doesn't fit!,These pads are are about 2/3 the size of the pad intended to fit the mop and do not work. This is the first time that I have been disappointed with an Amazon order. Next time I will make a point of reading the reviews before ordering.
3,There's a reason this book is out of print...,"If you think you're going to learn optics with this textbook, you are very very wrong. In fact, this text is on many levels much worse than the Born & Wolf bible. At least Born/Wolf explains their equations and how they got to them. Haus doesn't even do that - he just magically pulls equations out of the air. Oh, he says it is simple algebra, but that simple algebra usually takes an hour or two or work. Not at all very good at explaining physical phenomena and it is quite terse. In fact, terse would be the one word I'd use to describe this text.A much better text to use would be Guenther or Yariv or Saleh & Teich. Guenther covers more of the E&M optics, while the latter two cover the optical resonators, ABCD formalism, coupled systems, etc."
4,It's all in the details ... or in the extras,"Fans of the late Glenn Quinn already knew that this DVD would be a can't-miss, since ""R.S.V.P."" was Quinn's last film. The movie itself is a fairly standard tongue-in-cheek thriller, with a cast that all seemed to be having a good time gently tweaking the conventions of the genre (including Jason ""Jay"" Mewes doing basically the same character as always), but as often happens, the real strength of this DVD is in the ""special features."" The deleted scenes show the viewer an entirely new perspective on the movie and its characters, particularly Hal Evans, the character played by Quinn. In pleasant contrast to the ""Angel"" season 1 DVD released earlier this year, the production commentary acknowledges Quinn's contribution to the film and his untimely death. Make sure to watch the production commentary all the way to the end, past the very end of the final credits. Too bad we'll never see that sequel."
3,Its just a time killer,"This film is not what I expected after reading the reviews on here. The film drew me in and the writer did a great job of taking us into this laid back party with about a dozen stoners and some of the more intellectual dialoque was interesting. Yet, the main premise of the movie the serial killings failed. They were yawners. Nothing groundbreaking, not suspenseful, nothing to make you think. As for the end it was just plain st-pid. I wouldn't have paid the 75 cents plus shipping that I did for it if I had known. I would only recommend this film if you happen to come across it on tv and have the time to kill- for atleast it probably won't bore you though it won't necessarily entertain you either."
4,bombastic,"I know a lot of people don't like Good Charlotte because they're punk pop (or ""punk"" as some may put it) and because their vocal/guitarist, Benji, dresses all punk. People shouldn't judge bands just because of what they wear, and also if they don't like that type of music. Good Charlotte writes their own music and actually know how to play their instruments. Personally, I like a few punk pop bands including GC, blink, and simple plan. I like them for their music, not for what they wear, how people label them, or what genre of music they are in.Anyways, Lifestyles is a good song. I love the last 30 or 40 seconds where the bass is heavier. The lyrics and the music video are okay. Their album, The Young and the Hopeless, is awesome. I highly recommend it for fans of GC and pop punk fans. My favorite songs on the album are: The Anthem, Wondering, Hold On, The Young and the Hopeless, and Movin' On."
4,Circle Thrice James Axler,Book was in good shape and taken care of. Timely shipment and it was a good book. It was a good read.
3,Mechanically underwhelming,"It does what we need it to, but the hinge is poorly designed. Rather than hold open the mouth at a jaunty angle, as in the picture, the parallelogram collapses and the top teeth flop over to the side.You can balance it ok for display (or a catalog photo) but for sure don't let anyone touch it!Also hinge popped out day one."
3,Can love conquer all?,"In ""Pride and Pumpernickel"", St. Louis resident Dana is working tirelessly as the general manager for a series of ""Mom and Pop"" bakeries. As competition from a larger, increasingly popular bakery threatens the success of the business, the owners bring in New York City gourmet chef Ethan to revamp their menu. Dana loves the tradition of the bakery and doesn't think a major overhaul is in order. Though they disagree on the future direction of the bakery, they both agree that there is a definitive attraction for each other.Dana and Ethan face struggles as they fail to agree of work related issues. We follow their journey as they contemplate whether their faith in God and love for each other will allow them to overcome other obstacles.Notably, Dana is the sister of Max, the focus of Aisha Ford's earlier novel ""Stacy's Wedding"". Throughout the story we are updated on characters from this story."
2,Does a 180 on you!,"I first read the Consul General's Daughter which is the continuation of this book. I was dissapointed, however, with the way this book turned out. The book starts out wonderfully and if it stopped half way through it would have been wonderful. The books continues, though, and completly turns around half way through. Insane things begin to happen that make no sense what-so-ever. I would recommend this book to anyone, if you stop half way through."
2,A 296 page X-Files plot.,"I bought this book when I needed a reading fix. I thought, ""Hey, computers. This might be good."" What I found was an interesting story about a handicapped kid, who, through single minded determination, hacked his way throughout the early net. When he succeeded he didn't know what to do. He was very good. Everyone got scared. They gang up on him, etc...Actually, in style, I felt this was more of an embellished chronoligical report. The authors tossed in some UNIX, some DOS, some typical computer nerds, a few inattentive/ inexperienced government employees, a good bit of sermonizing and stirred heartily. With a little tweaking this would make a good X-Files episode. Especially the scene where the our intrepid heroes rush in to capture the criminal and his Quasimodo like appearance makes Scully feel sorry for the poor guy.If only someone could tell me why there's an index at the end."
1,Misleading and can kill you!,"I am a physician and have studied health and nutrition for 40 years. Milk, whether raw or pasturized is absolutely horrible for your health. Aside from the fact that you can catch the bovine (cow form) of TB from raw milk, regular milk is extremely bad for your health also. Experts now estimate that as many as 25% of ALL heart attacks in the US may be due to cheese alone. There are also many studies showing that the more milk you drink, the more likely you are to have osteoporosis and hip fractures (contrary to the lies told by the Dairy Industry). I personally had my blood pressure drop by 40 points when I quit dairy products. And my wife's cholesterol dropped 60 points. Read the book Eat to Live by Joel Fuhrman, M.D. to see what's proven good and bad for your health by thousands of scientific studies."
5,Truth is Superior to Fiction,"Surprisingly good! One big fat book on milk--raw, pasteurized, homogenized, ultra-pasteurized, organic etc. Explains how the politics of the past have produced the present prevalent consumption of pasteurized milk, and the negative consequences of this practice on human health. Very informative and worthwhile. Should belong to every health-conscious individual."
5,Old Lies Reviewed,My mother always told me you got TB from drinking Raw Milk. Well this is not only incorrect it is also biologically impossible. There are many other inconsistancies as well and Ron Schmid addresses them one by one. The book prompted me to do some research and I have come to the conclusion that we consumers are not getting the best deal. Unfortunately in my country it is illegal to sell raw milk. I think that's a shame. I would like the freedom to choose. Thank you Ron Schmid for putting the record straight.
1,Muffled recording taped in the audience,"When I got this CD, I was very disappointed. This is not a professional recording, but rather one taped by someone in the audience. The sound is muffled instead of being crisp. And the backup group obviously was not very familiar with the songs. They would go off on solos, and never complete them because they got lost in the riff and ran out of time before the vocal was supposed to return... In addition, the CD was not playable on my computer, so I could not put it on my iPod..."
4,C-in2 A-frame,Store did a great job - these t's run really tight in the arm-opening though. go a size larger if you have any sort of shoulder muscles
1,The late kung fu master's name is dishonored yet again,"This movie is, to put it mildly, an abomination on Bruce Lee's name. Released seven years after his death, the new footage is shoddily edited with some scenes of Lee to try and make a sequel to one of Lee's most famous films. There is practically nothing to recommend GAME OF DEATH 2. One of the earlier reviews says that Lee imposter Bruce Le (star of MY NAME CALLED BRUCE, a very obscure chop socky flick) stars instead. Simply, this movie is garbage, shame on Raymond Chow for producing this. When will people realise there was only one Bruce Lee, and the Bruce Le's, Li's, Lai's should be ashamed as well. My advice is don't watch this, check out GAME OF DEATH 1 or ENTER THE DRAGON again and see THE REAL MAN in action!!"
2,Assembly required Bissell vacuum - not easy!!,"I didn't see in the ad where this vaccum needed to be assembled. It comes in a few parts and I still haven't figured it out. I will be sending it back. For the few dollars you save buying it online, you lose more than that in time and aggravation trying to put it together, so better to just buy it from a store."
5,Iogear 5 Port Hi-Speed USB 2.0 PCI Card ( GIC251U ),This is a product that works. Ordered because of message rec'd when connecting Philips 30G mp3 player. Since installation working has been a pleasure.
5,Amazing!,"I bought this for my HP desktop beacuse it didn't have USB 2.0 but had XP, so I bought this. Fast shipping, easy install, and WOW does it work!"
4,"Warning to Mac users, do Not install software","Do not install the software if you are running os 10.2 or greater.It will cause your computer to not boot up. This is a problem that Iogear is aware of, but only after sending out the manuels.Without installing any software the card works. Just started using it today, all peripherals work fine."
1,FAILED,"I bought this card, installed easily, recognized easily by my Dell computer. For 2 days. Then FAILED completely. I switched it to 2 other PCI slots with no success. Just did not work."
4,Emile Henry 9x9 Square Bakeware,"I am so impressed with the quality and the appearance of Emile Henry Bakeware. The 9x9 Square Bakeware is one of several pieces of Emile Henry Pottery that you will find in my kitchen.The food cooks evenly and to perfection each time I use the 9x9 Square Baker,not to mention the easy clean up. The 9x9 Square is perfect for a small family; I prepare buritoes, cornbread, brownies, meatballs and fruit cobblers in this particular piece."
5,Rolls Royce of bakeware,"You can feel that this is quality bakeware the minute you pick it up. It's heavy-weight, substantial bakeware that looks great on your table, too. Since purchasing this I have baked chicken, cakes, mac & cheese and veggie casseroles and everything turned out beautifully. Nothing sticks so clean up is very easy - no soaking needed."
2,This item was not that comfortable.,"As I'm sitting in this ""tush cush"" while typing to you right now, I can tell you that the product is not all that it's cracked up to be. Your butt still gets numb and achey over a short period of time in an office chair. I was hoping the cushion would be a little more comfortable. When first sitting in your chair, it also takes a while to get everything positioned, as it is either too far back, or too far to the right, or too far to the left, etc... I give it two stars for adding the slightest amount of cushion to a new office chair, but people thinking about purchasing this product would be much better off getting a larger memory foam or gel-pad chair cushion. Hope this helps."
2,Too Hard for Me,"This cushion is too hard for me. I'm about 135 lbs. and the cushion does not compress enough to be comfortable. My thighs feel where it ends, being considerably more shallow than my chair seat. I lost the really comfy one I had from my doctor and was trying to replace it."
1,Beware of shipping,"My wife is a dedicated baker who makes awesome pies. She was in need of a new pie plate and this got very high reviews so I ordered it in plenty of time for Christmas. Unfortunately, it arrived in a box way too big with almost no packing to cushion it so as you might expect it was in many pieces! I sent it back for a refund but it's too late for this Christmas to order another. Someone needs to inform the shipping department of this vendor to avoid this kind of waste."
3,I agree,"I agree with the above review about Carmen in particular. However, I feel that this is one of my favorite recordings of the musicians, despite the preformers."
3,WWE No Mercy 2003,"This is Mudd.PPV Name-No Mercy 5Date-10/19/03Buyrate-.50Attendance-9,000Location-Baltimore, MarylandArena-1st Mariner ArenaPurchase WWE - No Mercy 2003 (DVD)Billy Kidman over Shannon MooreTajiri over Rey Mysterio for the WWE Cruiserweight TitleChris Benoit over A-TrainZack Gowen over Matt HardyBasham Brothers over The AcolytesVince McMahon over Stephanie McMahon in an I QUIT matchKurt Angle over John CenaBig Show over Eddie Guerrero for the WWE US TitleBrock Lesnar over Undertaker for the WWE SmackDown Title"
2,horrible,this whole ppv was absolutly horrible. except for john cena vs kurt angle and rey mysterio vs tagiri
2,Not at all J5,"A couple of tracks on this album are very good, but many tracks suffer from poor production. The lyrics are solid, but the beats are poor. The Platform and Ear Drums Pop are by far the best two tracks. Contrary to popular opinion I see very little similarities between Dilated Peoples and Jurassic 5. Quality Control is a much better album with a completely different sound."
3,No great shakes,"Pretty average stuff. Unimaginative beats, too many shout outs to themselves and below par rhymes. Spend your cash on Blazing Arrow by Blackalicious or Jurassic 5's Quality Control."
2,Cheap connectors,"This case has a nice slim design and it worked like a charm, until the USB port broke. It seems the materials they use are not very high quality."
1,Lame,"This is the lamest movie I have ever seen. I was bored with the movie only 10 minutes into it but kept watching it to see if it had any redeeming features - it didn't. I couldn't care less about any of the characters and the jokes were crass and I didn't laugh, chuckle or smile at any point throughout the movie. Lame lame lame. Don't waste your money or your time."
3,Flawed,Noticed that when attempting to make a u turn the pedal comes within less than an inch of the tire and subsequently it is very easy for your shoe to hit the tire
4,Great Bike,"I would give this 5 stars but assembling was a pain, the instructions were limited so you basically had to figure it out yourself, so now im taking it to a bike shop. Overall this is an awesome bike, my boyfriend absolutely LOVES it!!"
5,Honestly Speaks for a Generation,"The Long Slow Death of a Twenty-Something is funny at all the right times, and serious at all the right times. It reflects how many, if not all, of us have felt when we begin to wonder what world we really belong to. The movie is very well written, and the actors and actresses deliver their characters expertly. It will give you plenty to think about at the end, while still presenting a fair amount of closure. I would definitely recommend this movie!"
3,Dull Millard...,"Not so much a reappraisal of Fillmore as the first comprehensive gathering of the facts. Raybach's book is a scholarly effort, and it would be hard to criticise the concise way in which he retells the story of this unknown president. But even his best efforts cannot help the book from being dragged down by the essential blandness of its subject. Fillmore was not as good as the greatest presidents nor as bad as the worst. If you are looking for an undiscovered gem in the presidential rough best try Polk."
4,Choosing to care,"Passing by Samaria is an historical fiction novel that focuses on life in Chicago and Mississippi during 1919. I enjoyed this piece of Christian fiction because Sharon Foster has used a wonderful story to demonstrate a biblical truth...""A new heart will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh."" Ezekiel 36:26 Alena's character moves from tragedy to triumph in this heart wrenching story of life in Chicago and Mississippi during the early 1900's"
4,A Great Boy Book,I read this book for my Reading Project at Morgantown Elementary. I would recommend this book to anyone who ever had a pet that's always getting into trouble. Pets can be a big responsibility and this book teaches you how to take responsibility for you pet.
2,For Expert Eyes Only !,"This is a book for Jews. I found a great deal of it incomprehensible, as the author assumes a knowledge in the reader that I doubt many non-Jews would have. Having said that, even though I did not understand much of the book, and gave up two thirds of the way through, I could see that this is a work of deep scholarship. Leonora Leet wrote this book, and the other three in the series, as a labour of love. The culmination of a lifetime's work. The quality of the writing is incredible and serious students of Judaism and Kabbalah are bound to gain from its perusal. I myself learned a great deal about Judaism from it, but the majority of it remained a mystery to me. For someone who is from a Jewish background I am sure that there will be many insights to be gained from this book. I think it is destined to become a classic."
5,A real time-saver!,"In a world where we've almost lost the art of written communication, this book reminds us all how to write a good letter without the use of smiley face icons and 'LOL.' With time constraints pressing on us from all directions, any guide that saves us time is a Godsend, and this book saves hours of thinking time by providing the perfect format, wording, and handling of many different letter situations. This book is especially useful to young people, high school students and college graduates who may not have been schooled in the fine art of letter etiquette, and it's a valuable addition to any home library. The written word, when used well, can open doors. Sandra Lamb provides a key communication tool with this book, and I'm keeping it close by."
1,Very disappointed,"After only a few uses I put this roaster in the oven (from room temperature) at 400F with food in it to cook for Thanksgiving. After about 5 minutes we heard a VERY loud pop. The dish broke exactly in half and created a huge mess in the oven. My guess is that it was a flawed dish, but after 8 months of e-mailing and calling the company and getting no response, I am giving up. I won't buy Emile Henry items again based off of this experience and their lack of response."
1,Here comes the crap,"The documentary was garbage. The ""never before seen interview"" with lesnar about coming back was the pos that they put on raw when he came back. It was all kayfabe and just garbage. I wanted a backstage non kayfabe autobiography. Not this crap. The only good thing are the matches but even those have been put on 2-3 or even 4 DVD sets already. Total waste of money."
2,very good shane and kane match up,shane and kanemost people don't think that this match was any good because it contain 2 many spots but guess what tlc matches contain 2 many spots and it is considered as 1 of da best matches n wwe history not saying that this was on da same level of tlc matches no way near it but saying it was very entertaining shane bump alot for kane some innovative spots come 2 play thoughtout da match slightly underatted if u ask me 7.5/10

2,"Misleading cover sub-title, all in all, disappointing","As a description of the Phoenix Program, very weak. Cover subtitle (ie. The Phoenix Program in Vietnam) should have been left out as it's misleading at best -- I was looking for much better info than just snippets of related experience. One of the weaker memoirs I've read on Vietnam; surprised it's still in print. ""Once a Warrior King"" far better both in content and style."
2,A Poor 2nd To The Mini-Series,"Apparently D. Brown never saw the original release on TV. (And Wings Day did NOT escape to Italy; he was re-captured, and sent to Sachsenhausen concentation camp -- from which he also tunnelled out.)I wish I had read the review of ""A Viewer"" before ordering. The commercial version omits several scenes, including ""Mike Corey""'s arrival at Sagan and a large chunk of him being re-united with the French Resistance agent, ""Marie"".If this is re-released on DVD, I hope Vidmark will use the original version; then I will definitely upgrade my review."
5,A very good movie,"I frist saw this movie when my dad recorded it on tape. even though the tape is very old, the movie is very good and tells the 'real' story of the Stalag Luft 3 escape. the acting is supurb, Christopher Reeve's ability to pull off this character is absolutly riviting. Even thought the 1963 version of the Great Escape is very good, this one is so much better!"
4,dougv,"A well written book about 3 men who overcome huge obstacles. I wish the 3 doctors hadgiven more advice. Most of the book only relates their story. Their concept of forminga pact with each other to ensure each of them succeeds is a great idea. The book shows the value and need for close and supportive relationships, as they talk about their lifetimepact with each other, so essential in their harsh & uncaring environment. The authors alsoshow the value of seeking other people to help you along your way in life.Another of their books, The Bond, is richer in content, with solid advice on how toreconcile a broken relationship with their absentee fathers. Be sure to read this book.A much needed book with over half of the families in America having no father."
5,INSPIRATIONAL PACT (token787),"I give these young men 10 stars if I could. This story is for the young as well as the old. Everyone has a story and this story needed to be told, it doesn't matter what happened or where u have been, it's what your doing now and where u r going. It's an inspirational story and I am proud of them. For the reviewers that's being negative (get a life) maybe in today's world this story will inspire more children to go to college instead of being on the streets. I'm glad this story was written and told and they r an inspiration to all."
5,The Ultimate Inspiration,"After reading this book, I fully realized that there is no reason why my African American brothers and sisters cannot succeed and prosper. These men faced all kinds of adversity and in spite of it, they persevered. This book should be required reading for every African American male."
5,A truly inspirational story,"I have read this book twice already, and each time I read it I am amazed. This is truly a book that you read and know that if you dream it, you can achieve it. I feel that the real aspect of the book was the best part about it, these doctors did not hold anything back. They showed that even if you do have struggles, you can overcome them and become something great."
3,The Pact,This book wasn't so bad even though it bored me to death in class when I was reading it. I suggest if your not interest in reading skip the first few chapters and continue on with the other chapters then go back and review for more information. Fair price at my school this book cost 15DOLLAR'S thank goodness i didn't buy it at school and I was cleaver enough to look it up on Amazon...
2,Gives a so-so picture,"I bought this cable to interface a PC with an S-Video output to a VCR with a composite video input. I was really disappointed. The picture had bands of interference in it. I thought this might be due to the computer, so I tried using the cable to go from an S-Video output of a DVD player back to the the same VCR. The picture *was* better, but you could still see faint intereference bands, espeically if the picture was more white than black. I finally bought a shielded RCA cable to see if the RCA cable was picking up the interference; still no help.It's not like this adapter doesn't work. But it doesn't work well."
2,High Hopes - Sad Outcome,"So I have a fairly old stereo receiver that has RCA and S-Video and some other bells and whistles - top of the line Sony from 1998. Anyway, I just picked up a Micca media player (here on Amazon) that only has RCA or HDMI, but no S-Video. The receiver only outputs on the type of interface that the signal comes in on and I really didn't want to have to run RCA through the walls to the TV now. So I opted to convert the RCA to S-Video for the input.It does work - sort of. I do see the picture, but the quality is very poor. Perhaps it's just the nature of the conversion and any manufacturer's version of such a converter would suffer from the same issue. Either way, it's unacceptable."
2,Crappy Foam,"The inner foam comes bent, I guess because of the way it is packed for easy shipping, it never gets the right shape. The bag is kinda big and hard to carry if you put all your stuff inside, but overall is a nice bag for the price."
2,very low budget,"There were moments of talented acting, but overall poor. The actress playing the mother was much too young and totally not believable. Not sure all the female parts were actually played by females. All the men looked like chippendale dancers, that was perhaps a good thing. The special effects were so not special. I would have given it one star but the second was in gratitude for no gratuitous sex although there were a couple scenes of full rear male nudity."
5,Excellent movie,"J'ai beaucoup aimé ce film .BRAVO à Gregori Holderbach, il a fait un travail superbe.. Parmi les acteurs, j'ai particulièrement apprécié Melissa Searing.Le scénario est très original. Je recommande ce film , c'est un film qu'il faut voir."
2,Dry and Dull,"I wish I could just copy drB's review here-I realize that most purchasing this book have no choice in the matter, but in the probably unrealistic hope that perhaps a professor will stumble upon these reviews while selecting a book, I am adding another review. This book takes what is a very interesting subject matter and sucks anything that might possibly be interesting out of it and turns it into something overly complicated and dry. The book is dull and leaves me searching out other sources for examples to the points it brings up. A 20 minute reading assignment turns into an hour long project so that I feel I understand the material-it's just bad-I dread this class because of this book."
3,Benzino: Redmeption,"I did not like this CD because Benzino's lyrics reveal that he is a hypocrite. All though he has accused another rapper, who I am not fond of either, of disrespecting black women, Benzino's lyrics depict women as disposable sexual objects. Apart from the lyrics, the music is typical. Nothing new and exciting."
1,Capital G for Garbage,You know why he's rubbing his eys on the album cover?Benzino is old and tired.Please retire.Nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap.So put the mic down and walk away.
1,Nothing very innovative on this album,"I can't believe I bought this album; wish I would have saved my money for something a little more artistically creative. The only parts of the album I enjoy are the guest spots by other artists. And having three different version of 'Rock the Party' is just a little too much filler for me. Don't waste your money on this dud, and especially don't waste your time."
1,F Zino,"I'm not saying that there may not be any tracks on this CD from The Source legend, but i think Zino personally is a sleazy, cocky mofo who abuses his power as being one of the head in charge at The Source. Ja's R.U.L.E. only got 4 stars 'cause he worked closely with Zino before. I will admit that Game who was in G- Unit got a 4 mic Cd even though he saif f--- the source on one of the tracks, but I still believe that Zino had something to do with Ja getting four stars on that CD. Plus, I know it sounds kind of strange to call a black or latino guy dissing a white guy racist, but tht's what benzino really is... A racist."
1,Oh boy.........this gentleman cannot rap,"I'd like to say that this man is an excuse to hip-hop, let alone an excuse to any type of music. I bought this cd because of 'rock the party' (actually that song is bangin') but got depressed hearing the rest of this cd. Please, Benzino, learn to rap, and at least try to go half as fast as the average rapper! Heck, Twista makes this gentleman seem like a turtle! This Benzino guy needs to learn that the rap game is something he can't keep up with....he's trying to mess with the white man from Detroit that cannot be beat....now matter how hard Benzino tries."
1,WACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This dude along with the SOURCE magazine suck!!!!! He talks about how hip hop is crap in 2004, when he puts out an album that is the definition of why hip hop sucks in 2004. Benzino is jiggy, and would get served by Chingy in a rap battle...."
2,"A REAL HIP HOP review on Benzino's "" Redemption"" album.","This IS NOT a hip hop CD. This CD will NOT make you think, nor will it make you feel like the music is authentic or related to real hip hop. This CD will most likely be played in clubs or at some teen and/or young adult parties. Some of the songs are actually decent, and will make you move your head. But if you are a true hip hop fan, then you won't be feeling this CD. In my opinion, I rather listen to Eminem's CDs because there's more diversity, more thoughts, more feelings, more creativity put into his CDs. In Benzino's CD, there's too much glamour, too much flossing, too much ""industry"" type lyrics put into his album. But then again, I believe he made this CD for the clubs and parties. But to review this and categorize this album under hip hop would not be right because this album surely isn't hip hop."
3,um...,ok this is good... but i was wondering if amazon.com will be having the 6 month cards available too?... you know... the ones that make it so it costs 13 dollars a month instead of 14 like the 2 month one or 15 like the 1 month one does... i would really appreciate it if they started having those available...
4,WoW 60day prepaid game card,"showed up as advertised, code unscratched *in fact hard to scratch d(-.0z* would buy again. very good deal and speedy."
5,EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!,"I needed my World of Warcraft gaming code emailed to me because I was on travel away from my stash of pre-paid game cards. He/she was kind enough to scratch the card for me and email the code which got me back playing ASAP. A truly understanding gamer, I received my code within hours of payment. Would gladly buy from again! Thanks!"
4,Cheaper than paying monthly on website,Got this for $29.95 here at Amazon. As of this writing game costs $14.99 a month via the game website. But game website charges sales tax so bring monthly bill to around $16.50 so thats $33 for 60 days. With Amazons free shipping and no tax charged in NYC area I get it for $30. so a savings of $18 a year. Some say why not use the 6 month or 12 month plan on website to save money. Well cause I have to lay out that money up front. So that 12 months up front could be in bank getting 5% interest. Only have to lay out for 2 months at a time.Better deal as far as I am concerned.
3,"Good, but wasteful","My wife and I use these to keep our playing habit under control. We have to make a conscious decision every 60 days to keep going, and we get to keep our credit card information to ourselves.As others have mentioned, however, this is extraordinarily wasteful. They are overpackaged and the entire package and everything in it hits the landfill the second the code is entered.Ideally Amazon could just show us the code on their site; they're doing a lot of other digital delivery these days.Hence three stars: five, minus two for the sickening inefficiency."
5,World of Warcraft 60 day pre paid Time Card,Our son in law was very excited to get this as he loves to play games on line. The purchasing process was easy and straightforward and was as represented in add. Would purchase from here again!
4,price watching,"I'm sorry I missed the $23 price mentioned in other reviews. I have been tracking the price for the last 6 months and it seems to fluctuate between $24.99 and $29.99. If you want to track it yourself, the easiest way is to put it in your shopping cart and move it to the ""save to buy later"" section. Now every time you bring up your shopping cart it will tell you if the price has changed since your last visit--there will be a message at the top of the shopping cart page. If you can get it at $23, more power to you, but my recommendation would be to grab it when it hits $24.99."
5,Wow Game Card,"Esta es la mejor opcion para aquellos que no deseean exponer su TDC en la pagina de Wow y prefieren hacerlo por Amazon que es un servidor seguro demostrado, la tarjeta dura 60 dias a partir de su activacion en el sistema, no de su adquisicion."
2,for obsessive completists only,"if you're even looking at this dvd you are probably already an obsessive felt completist so i'm not expecting to sway many readers... that said, after i got the disc i was going to play it for a friend to introduce her to the band. unfortunately the quality is so bad that i instead quickly turned it off and put on a CD. pretty much unwatchable. would instead spend money on buying original Train Above the City/Jackson Pictoral Review CD if you can find anyone to part with theirs..."
1,Paid Over $10 for It From Amazon,"Bought it for $10.74 from Amazon and found $2.99 at K-Mart. Later $3.46 at Amazon, but it's from a different vendor."
1,Extremely BAD Product,Turtle Wax advertises that this is safe for all wheels. This produced a white milky haze all over my wheels that was incredibly hard to remove. After extensive labor and scrubbing with a cleaner/polish some (not all) of the staining has been removed. I called Turtle Wax customer support who offered no solutions or compensation. What a nightmare.
2,Soap and water just as good,"First off, I'll admit that I'm not big on car vanity. I rarely clean the car and almost never the wheels. Perhaps with a mildly dirty wheel this product will do the trick. My wheels were not completely gunked up, but they had a medium amount of brake dust on them. This product, plain and simply, did next to nothing with the brake dust. The regular dust around the center of the wheel and near the tires came off just fine, but I imagine soap and water would have fared as well. The brake dust didn't come off after applying a liberal amount of the T-159R, nor did it come off after rinsing with water as directed.My review specifically targets the product's claim, ""Quickly penetrates and removes tough brake dust and road grime from all wheel surfaces"". This is simply not true in my experience. If you have your car professionally cleaned and you need an interim light dust cleaner, by all means pick some of this up, it does fine. I wanted the brake dust gone. I still do."
4,side splitting funny,what can I say - Roseanne is very funny - love the interaction between son in fact all the people. sometimes she can be a little much but I can see myself in her.Esp the mouth!!!!!!!!
5,Excellent cook book,This cookbook is interesting and informative about balsamic vinegar. And the recipes are wonderful. Have tried several and love them all.Highly recommend it.
3,M.I.A. - Bucky Done Gun,"M.I.A. continues her overtake of the musical world with the second disc of BUCKY DONE GUN, a track with equal parts toughness and raw sexuality. DJ Marlboro brings some of the Brazillian funk carioca to his mix, throwing in some digital skank into the mix. YLS, on the other hand, strips the track down to its percussive bass, with a few stabs of instruments here and there, while DaVinChe speeds up the lyrics slightly and overlays some dramatic horns and strings that don't quite work with the track. Good overall, but not mind-blowing."
4,Good Series....,"This series follows a young girl, who has to struggle with staying alive long enough to face her true destiny. Awesome Series, great watch...but not for kids..."
3,Good Enough,"Most of the drinks aren't anything that I would like, but they are really good ideas. I like having options for people who don't drink liquor. I think if you really wanted most of these you could look online and find most of them."
2,It leaks,"I've gone through two of these bike seats and they've both ended the same, they leak. The first one I thought was just the end result of two years of use, but the second one has only lasted 3 months. The gel distorts and collects in one section and then starts to leak through and then I'm riding with a dishrag over my seat or otherwise be sticky with what feels like funky tree sap.For while it lasts though it works and feels great."
3,MY BUTT IS HAPPY AT SPIN CLASS BUT......,"Comfortable padding on seat for spin class! Cushion gel pad -- so nice! Addendum: After 3 months, the gel in the cushion began to break apart! However, by this time, I don't need it as I have gotten used to the hard seat on the spin bike..."
3,Didn't fit,Gave this 3 stars as it seemed like it would provide good padding but it was too small to fit over the seat of the stationary bike I had purchased
2,Doesn't Last,"Used on bicycle saddle for about 2 mos & a spinner for 6 mos or so; noticed that the top gel layer ripped under the lycra cover, not cool. I contacted Schwinn & they replied that the warranty is 90 days but if I would like to I could send it to them & they ""would be happy to complete an inspection for possible replacement"". Hadn't decided if the shipping cost would be worth it!"
3,Not a total butt saver,"I was hoping this would make using our exercise bike less painful. It does help a little bit but after a few minutes on the bike I still feel uncomfortable and after abt 30 min my butt feels a bit violated. If you are looking for total comfort, I suggest you keep looking. I am."
2,Good product but..,"good product, but mine is already with some damage on the gel, with a few hours os usage."
3,mine as well have been a you got served sequel,i enjoyed the movie it was almost just like you got served accept it had tweens cute lil kids i think marques houston should have reprised his role from you got served and taught the kids instead he plays a business man that knows nothing about dance that starts working at a community center where he meets the kids he starts working there as a community service sentence for something he did. they go off the story of someone that doesn't like kids and doesn't really wanna be there etc than he ends up taking a liking to them and teaching them vauble lessons
3,Good read.,"Its a nice read. The description of Bombay, and character in stories is excellent. Each story is well arranged. Nice names to stories too."
4,gripping vignettes....,"if you're expecting a travel guide to bombay city, this is most certainly not one. what you will find are some beautifully crafted human studies of that peculiar creature called the bombayite. probably every city will produce a corresponding city-ite, thus bombayites with their particular idiosyncracies and that's what seems to me to be the heart of this book.what struck me about this author is how he combines vividness of narrative with an economy of words - paradoxical. but delivered here."
5,Colored Pencil Drawing,This book was just what I was looking for.All of Lee Hammond's books are must haves in your art library.
1,Loved it until it broke,This was the perfect good-looking replacement for boring Pyrex and I used it often - until one day it suddenly cracked right down the middle while I was roasting a small turkey breast in the oven. Makes me completely wary of purchasing another as they're quite expensive. I have a similiar roasting dish from Cost Plus that's made in Portugal and is still going strong. Wish I could find more of those instead. (much cheaper)
1,"Part of the ""DVD Ripoffs"" trend.","I saw this at the DVD store today. I knew it was gonna be some RATATOUILLE rip-off (I haven't seen Ratatouille yet), and let me just say: Thank God I also rented AMERICAN HISTORY X. I watched it and I couldn't even make it all the way. Horrible Animation, even worse voice acting. The jokes are NOT for the intended audience, and After seeing the 20 minutes of this that I watched, I concluded that I need to see RATATOUILLE and not this junk."
1,Not on the ball,"I hate being on the floor so I bought this ball & program expecting to get my exercize off the ground. For some of her program, she has you on the floor and not ""on the ball"". For some of her exercises, you don't even need the ball.Not what I was expecting."
1,I do not reccomend this if you are a beginner!,"This is not a good beginners workout and it is boring. There are no options given if you are not strong enough to do the moves. Since this is a 'beginners' work out- well it would be helpful. Also there is not an overview to the the basic moves, tips or even proper use of the ball, etc. I am truly a beginner- but even if I were experienced- it's dull.I bought this because of the reviews- Does Amazon allow anyone to review- or only people who have bought the product!?!?!?!?!?"
5,Great Ab Workout,"I am kind of new to the pilates thing, but the few videos I have done, I have loved. This one was no exception. It was so much fun that when it was over, I was left thinking, ""is that it""? Hah. Although I consider myself to be fit with good ab strength, it has been two days and I am still sore. I do agree with other reviewers that said this workout is something to build up to. You probably won't master it on the first try."
3,Liked it but...,"I wanted an accessory that would separate my black phone from my husband's black phone, we have the same model. This does just that as he wouldn't want a pink phone. It's a little difficult, at least for me, to get the back piece on (my husband got iton for me). But once it was on it did exactly what I wanted it to. My only other complaint would be about the clip. Somehow I broke the button at the top that releases the phone with out realizing it. Luckily I had bought other cases as back ups when I got this one. However I also managed to somehow break that clip too. I'm not a very active person and spend most of my time sitting so breaking them is both distressing and a mystery. I would recommend finding a way to get extra clips if you buy this style case. Overall it is a good case."
3,"To be bought with other baby books, don't just rely on this","Initially I thought this book was great but then realised some of the impracticalities. To suggest that you take your twins to the supermarket using two shopping carts (pushing one in front and pulling one behind you) made me laugh... I can't see how this is possible when you have four little hands grabbing things out of the cart and off the shelves!There are some really good tips though, such as how to keep the twins amused. Also the section on statistics and twin types was very interesting.I suggest parents also buy books such as ""What to Expect the First Year"" by Arlene Eisenberg."
5,Our House Divided. By Tomi Kaizawa Knaefler,This is a very important book which I will cherish and keep for my kids. I will always promote this book to people that are interested in the history of Japanese American's in America and Japan during WWII. The experiance that these seven families have gone through is unbelievible and could not be imagined. It makes me proud to be an American.
1,Save your money,"Total ripoff. Less than an hour including extras, more shots of crowd members than players, and the boring voice-over frequently reminding us that this is the only tennis tournament that really matters doesn't help a whit. A truly pointless dvd with very little tennis. Summing up hundreds of matches in about 30 minutes of footage? You do the math.Might be worth buying only if you were there and hope to see yourself in the many audience shots. Otherwise, with barely any tennis on the disc, what's the point? Pure fluff.Go instead to the infinitely better Classic Matches at Wimbledon series; the Borg/Mac 1980 dvd has more quality in five minutes than this does in 55, and costs half as much.Passola."

1,Inaccurate system requirements,"System requirements from back of case: Windows Vista XP, Me, 98; 486DX/66MHz or better; 16 MB RAM; 22 MB free hard disk space.HOWEVER what the web description and case DON'T tell you is that this software if for 32-bit Vista, and won't install on the 64-bit version. There's no way to know that until you've opened and tried to install. If you're going to buy this, review your computer's system type to see if it's compatible."
5,Great to get back into shape after delivery,"i knew it would be hard getting back into shape after my baby, BUT with this dvd it was EASY! Leisa Hart is excellent at giving short and simple cues to help you follow her routines, and i absolutely LOVE IT! The choreography is simple and not overly challenging, it is great for a beginner or someone who is in decent shape. I was definitely overwieght and out of shape when i got starte two months after having my baby, i only wish i had done her Fitmama Prenatal video and got started sooner because I was so out of shape after not working out for 3-4 years that it was a struggle to get motivated on my own, but when i started doing leisa's dvd it made me feel capable of getting into shape, slowly but surely. I am in no rush since i took so much time off, but i do feel some results and it is because of the instruction led by leisa hart. I really like her workouts and enjoyed losing my baby weight with this dvd."
3,Not bad,not very excited about it. this video is ok.thats why 3 star.i bought another to use with it.
4,My 100-word book review,"Nailed by the Heart, Simon Clark's debut novel, is a gripping, visceral story of ancient evil and supernatural powers, which I found occasionally reminiscent of John Carpenter's movie The Fog. I liked the story's location, a half-derelict fort at the very edge of the sea, and encountered plenty of uncomfortable and scary moments as the forces of evil started to close in on the good folks. This is not for the squeamish, as it contains some stomach-churningly gruesome scenes, and the writing does have a few rough edges, as befits a first novel. However, it is definitely worth a look!"
3,great? bad? good?,"okay. writing style: good. and the descriptions here is really great. the plot: a family settles down on a place that used to be a sacred site in heathen times. things has always happened around here, and now there's acceleration. something is coming. there are people in the water, living dead, out to kill. in the end the people must make a stand. yes, the descriptions are great. but the way the people's last stand was written..... i don't care for the people making a last stand - concept normally, and the creatures passivity and the way they were sometimes put in the background, i certainly didn't like. and there was something about the plot concerning the god i just couldn't buy. when the plot started evolving very much around the god, i lost much of my interest. so my feeling are mixed."
4,heartland,I really enjoyed this album. I brought it for the title track I loved her first. We had this as part of my husbands speech for our daughters wedding. There was not a dry eye in the house! This is my favorite track on the cd but all the rest are good as well.
2,GREAT PREMISE DERAILS,"David Hyde Pierce is Warwick Wilson, the consummate host. We see him carefully prepare for a dinner party - he impeccably sets the table and times the duck for exactly 8:30 p.m. And then career criminal John Taylor (Clayne Crawford) enters the scene posing as a friend of a friend. He tells a sad story of being mugged and losing his luggage. But as the evening progresses and the alcohol flows, a very different dynamic is revealed. This twisted psychological thriller reminds that appearances can be most deceiving. Although the critics did not embrace this film, I kind of enjoyed the LA based story, especially the apparent premise and first half. Before the story derailed, it captured a lot of what the City of Angels is all about in terms of how far we will go to satisfy our fantasies. As the poster says, ""Dinner parties are a dying art."" Nick Tomay is co-writer and director."
3,Tossed Salads & Scrambled Eggs,"Well this one came way out of left-field. I have always been a fan of David Hyde Pierce and think he is truly an underrated comedic genius. The director couldn't possibly have cast anyone better than DHP as the dementedly twisted, Warrick, for this dark mind-bending dramedy.What starts off as one set-up gets thrown for a loop into another, and so on and so on, so that the film rejuvenates itself quite a few times during its brief 90 min running time. There are as many twists as a classic Hitchcock, and plenty of dry-humor to soak up all of the building tension once the movie really gets going. However, I felt the backstory with John and Simone was uninteresting and really didn't add much to the flick, but whatever. Nonetheless, The Perfect Host is incomparable in its own right, and is a unique experience that you don't often see in cinema much these days."
2,Good Dryer - Flimsy Brush,"I don't usually leave reviews but, since I'm going to return this product to Amazon, I thought I take the time to comment on why. The dryer is fine; it doesn't overheat and yet it still drys quickly. The major problem with this dryer, though, is the brush attachment. No matter how many times I've tried to snap the brush in place, it continues to come off while I'm drying my hair. There's not much point in an attachment dryer without attachments!"
2,Another one bites the dust,"Bought this to replace another Conair that burned out. This one lasted several months before it began shooting sparks out of the base and caught fire. It had been handled gently, banged on nothing, and except for the flames shooting out looked brand new. Very dangerous product that doesn't deserve its Underwriters Laboratories seal."
5,"Conair SD6X, 1875-Watt, 3-in-1 Ionic Styler",I had a hair dryer similar to this in the eighties and wore it out. A friend said she found one on Amazon so I looked and now I have my favorite back.
2,"Great dryer, but...","This dryer works really well, but the attachments won't stay on. I've used a Conair dryer for a number of years without this problem. I won't be a repeat buyer."
5,Well made and a beautiful color!,"This item is exactly what I was looking for in a souffle dish. It is well made (France), smooth inside and out, exactly as described, and the color combination is crisp and pleasing to the eye. I look forward to making my first souffle soon. I am having a great adventure learning how to cook different types of food from different cultures. My family and friends have enjoyed tasting the new recipes that I have prepared for them. Now that I have retired, I have time to watch the cooking channel, and cooking has become fun for me again!"
2,Not as good as expected...,"I read this book on the beach in Ixtapa (along with about a dozen other books) and thought that the plot was OK, but the execution was iffy at best. He tends to dawdle a bit when exploring the sexual side of his heroes (darn near stops the book, in fact). He explains in excruciating detail what he is doing with his girl in bed (an embarassing look at his ideas about women and what he THINKS they want) while glossing over important plot details that would explain his protaginist's motivation and goals. If you enjoy the types of books that Bill Branon is trying to write, a better choice would be any of the books in the 'Bob the Nailer' series by Stephen Hunter. I will probably buy his next book, but if it has the same 'narrative stoppage' with his sex scenes that this book does, I will not buy any more."
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"In Sesame Street Toddler, the sound will not function after the opening credits. The packaging states that it is compatible with Win2000 SP4, yet the FAQ on the distributor site says that this is a known problem with Win2000 SP4. Without sound the software is useless.I haven't tried the other software in this package, perhaps one of the others will make it worth the price. Certainly this CD title is a coaster."
5,Good Value,This riflescope made for an excellent Christmas present. It has a clean sharp optic. The Bullet Drop Compensator (BDC) was everything I'd hoped for. I'd highly recommend this scope to anyone.
4,excellent,"Excellent video. Good organization in 10 minute workouts. It moves a little fast if you are a novice, but you can always go back and review."
3,God book but too general,"I ordered this book for my business library. I enjoyed the book, but if you want more specifics on the methods of detailed bond calculations, I would recommend a good financial investments text book."
1,Disappointing,"I, too, was disappointed in this book. I expected more information about how healthcare was going to move toward a more proactive approach. I found the book focussed on the author's views about his own products. Was not relevant to Australia - despite the fact that it says it is a book for all countries. A waste of my money!"
1,Huh! No Secrets Here,"I have read many books relating to ads & advertising and found this one to contain no value, no guidance, no tips and NO SECRETS.Many old tales and short quotes that offered no insight to modern day marketing and advertising.There are many good books out there, unfortunately for me and my pocketbook this is not one of them."
1,Tax Planning Strategies,"This book is for Canada tax laws and is published by CCH Canadian Limited. The description does not tell you so, so if you are interested in US tax law, this is NOT the book for you."
1,DISAPPOINTED,IT WAS NOT WHAT I OR MY FRIEND HOPED FOE IT LOOK AS IF THEY JUST BUSED NEWS FOOTAGE AND OTHER INFO INTERVIWSE ANT THREW THIS ALL TOGETHER
1,Camera software problems on some computers running WindowsXP,"I have a different model Kodak camera, however they all use the same EasyShare software. Running Windows XP, I could not get the software to work properly. After several hours on the phone with Kodak tech support, they couldn't get it working either.They said they are aware of the problem on some computers running Windows XP. It is now several months later and they still don't have a fix. They don't really seem to care either.It might not be a bad idea to consider other brands, instead of Kodak. Since, if the software won't work properly, then what good is the camera?"
1,"the price is great but, when I open up the lotion, I was totally, totally disappointed, it was too,"" yellowy & watery""","I would NOT recommend this products to you, especially you ladies out there, it's NOT worth the time to return it... although the price is great but, I didn't want to take any chances in using it on my skin..! Sadly to say, it also had that old, old awful smell, I kid you not.... It look like its been expose from the sun or heat that should of been protected from it's weather condition or something... Again, this is my honest experience, I end up throwing it away for the safety of my skin being protected from usuage of a spoil lotion... So, this messg. goes out to the ""Seller"" of ""Wholesale"" please, please double check on your products before you sell it out to the public,other wise in the long run, if anythings goes wrong with some customer's skins b-cuz of its color & being to watery, I'd take this advise...."
5,Outstanding book,the book is great. It gives step by step instructions to better presentation. Material can be used in every day life very effectively. I recommend every one to read this.
1,Trash!,The worst film of all! The movie lasts 6 minutes of someone nightmare and the end. No historical fundamentation or accuracy.
3,About the DVD,"Experienced dancers: The only reason to buy this DVD, in my opinion, is to see Suhaila. She is absolutely incredible. She emits a warm, modest, elegant stage presense with refined and lovely styling. Truly reflective of the spirit of Oriental Dance. The other dancers are very mediocre, not worth watching. So its five stars for Suhaila and one star for the others.NW Dancer"
3,3 Stars,"I have this and a few of Rainia's videos. To be honest, I don't really look at them that much. What I enjoyed most about the video was the sound track. I have been taking Raqs Sharki ( the PROPER) name for Eygptian style belly dance off and on for a few years now and one thing that was totaly absent from this video was the presence of strong hip movements. Shimmies, in particular. Don't even attempt to have a Drum Solo in your set if you cannot Shimmy.Another thing that was missing was diversity. In every class that I have seen or participated in there were women of ALL shapes, sizes and ethnicities (sp?) in class. This is an African/Middle Eastern dance style,how about some African/Middle Eastern dancers?"
5,Wonderful book for the young women of today,Reading this book sends out a message to the young people of today. It really hasn't changed much from their time to the present. It shows the true meaning of love. Something that alot of our young people cannot relate to. This book should be in all the middle schools/jr.hs. Great reading then and now!
5,Wonderful for Adolescents,"This book is just what we need in 1998. It addresses many of the Adolescent Developmental Tasks which are crucial in this day and age. Through this enlightening story of July and Bo Jo, we see the many consequences of teen sex and pregnancy. We also see two adolescents trying to develop their own identities, seperate from that of their parents. This book is a ""Must Read"" for any adolescent classroom!!!"
2,"Usual Superb writing, just not about Jaime and her brother","I was oh-so-excited when the book finally became available and I was able to purchase it. When I received the book I discovered that maybe half of the short stories contained within involved Jaime and her family. Hodgell's writing is excellent, of course, but I was expecting to spend the day feasting on unread tales of the adventures of my favorite heroine. I had no interest in the other stories that were included. What is there is good, but I would not have purchased the book if I had actually known what was contained. Borrowed it, absolutely, but not bought it. I guess I will just have to wait until her next book to get my Jaime fix. *grins*"
3,Good for what it is.. but..,"I liked it. It fills in a few things that leave you wondering. But if you're looking for more of the Jame story you'll be dissapointed. You'll find out a bit of Jame's childhood, and some of Ganths as well. ""So that's why he's so weird..."" It also has an alternate story line about her. I would suggest reading it."
2,"This is a magazine, not a paperback","Although there were some interesting recipes, I was extremelydisapointed when I opened the box to find a magazine. It is describedas a paperback, but it is printed on magazine-quality paper. Additionally, most of the recipes have appeared in MSL over the past two years. END"
4,Enjoyable!,"This book is not only about comfort food, but it made me a little cozy while I was reading it too! The recipes are not too complicated and the pictures are a delight to behold. Definitely a book worth buying."
2,If you have the patience and time . . .,"As will all Martha tomes, this book delights the reader with glossy color photography of all sorts of yummy comfort food, with an emphasis on texture.As a rule of thumb, any recipe that contains more than 7 ingerdients is prepared only once. More than a few of the recipes in this book have close to, and in excess of, 20 ingredients. Still, in its pages, are the simpler recipes and a few cooking/baking tips.Check out this one from a library before committing to even buying a good used copy."
5,fantasy striptease,"If you want the boys over for a pool game and you don't want something too rauchy playing in the background on the big screen TV, this is for you, nice ladies!"
3,The California Pop-Up Book,"The book is--for the most part,--masterfully engineered. The pop-up of the Golden Gate Bridge is particularly spectacular.There is, however, a blatant void concerning the dawn of California's written history--namely, there is not one pop-up of a Spanish mission. The cover of this book includes a mission bell tower in its collage-style design, suggesting there might be a mission inside. Nada.Perhaps a pop-up book of the 21 historic California missions is in order."
4,Great pocket reference!,"Useful not only for beginners but for travelers seeking a portable reference for on the road. Varietals, regions, and terms are laid out in a concise and easy-to-use/easy-to-find format."
5,Jack Palance As Dracula? YES!,"I remember waiting for ""Dracula"" to air on network television. The creator of the Dark Shadows soap opera was bringing the novel of Bram Stoker's ""undead stalker"" to the small screen. Jack Palance was announced to play the lead. To tell you the truth, this would not be the first name that would come to mind to cast the role that has been played over and over, but Palance makes one of the greatest ""Counts"" of all! There is just enough sympathy created for the character to make you almost care, but they don't overdo this element. He's still a bloodthirsty vampire stalking victims. This is a great DVD to add to your horror collection. The companion ""Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde"" was equally good for atmospheric sets, acting, and great direction. I was glad this became available."
2,Works on fresh bugs only,"The best stuff at sold at Autozone, but only works on fresh bugs. Doesn't make a dent on settled lovebugs."
4,"Good, not great","I got this product to make sure that I do not damage the clear coat on my car. While it is definitely great for that reason, it's ability to remove difficult bug and tar is just ok. Seems like I have to apply several times to get the job done. I do like the fact that there is a wax component incorporated though. Even though this is not a stellar review, I am not sure how much better of a product there is out there."
2,"Dim, confused and interminable","Straub's novel ambles along ponderously, going nowhere for hundreds of pages as he labors to build an atmosphere of mystery and dread, and exhausts his readers' patience with his unwillingness to let us in on what's happening. It's like watching a magician dash around the stage for twenty minutes, all dramatic poses and flourishes, without ever performing an actual trick. Occasionally Straub has someone die offstage in odd fashion. Yet two-thirds of the way through, we still know almost nothing about who or what is behind their deaths or why. All we know is that a terrible secret from the past has led to some form of supernatural revenge being taken decades later upon some very dull, thinly sketched characters with whom we have insufficient reason to empathize. That much I could have gotten from reading the jacket flap. By the time all this wearisome effort shows signs it might pay off in the final pages, it's too late to care."
4,A 4 STAR REVIEW,"Indeed, GHOST STORY is not for everyone. It aims more at the literary crowd rather then the gore-hounds that take center stage nowadays. But if any of the latter is curious enough to explore, this is the novel to get. Peter Straub's multi-faceted narrative mixed with a slow build up make this haunted tale of past mistakes and unforeseen future a one highly impressive read. There are many strong moments in GHOST STORY where the protagonists and the reader merge to face evil, scenes that vibrate with terror and danger. Straub incorporates them through imaginative storytelling and mesmeric prose. Yes, his plot and subplots may linger at times, and, yes, his climax is a somewhat complex delivery, but overall GHOST STORY is one piece of horror fiction that deserves the crossover, if only for the harrowing way Straub uses his pen.-----Martin Boucher"
2,Very Disappointed,"I purchased this book with great expectations of enjoying a suspenseful read. Unfortunately it's not. There's a great opening prologue involving an apparent kidnapper and a young girl who is apparently his victim. Then we move on to the Chowder Club, a group of old men who tell ghost stories and for the two hundred or so pages we are stuck. We get hints of horrors, a lot of confusing suggestions meant to baffle and keep the reader interested but it is done so often and for so long that it fails. Interesting and gripping moments along the way but too few to keep this reader's interest. I forced myself to the end however.Shame. I like some of Straub's books (Koko) and since this was hailed by so many as one of his best, I thought I'd enjoy it. Did not."
5,An excellent horror novel,"So....this is Straub's masterpiece??? That's what i learned before i read this book, and during reading it as well as after reading it it's pretty obvious it is. While you're reading it, it just has the feel of a great classic to it. Great writing by Straub, from the exciting prologue to the dark undertone kept throughout the story, this is maybe THE best horror book i've ever read and i highly reccomend this. Also, Straub does an excellent job of creating horror without being to bloody and gory about it(not that there isn't any). Very well done book. I also like how Straub's style leaves you feeling a continuing sense of horror and darkness building up through the story.Loved it."
4,staub's best,"the only reason i'm writing this puppy is because after reading all of straub's books, ghost story is the best. his earlier work (julia, if you could see me now) was pretty good, but not stephen king level. ghost story is, nuff' said."
1,Way too slow and long,"Trying to read this book was an awful experience. This book could be half as long as it is. I was so aggravated with it after being 2/3's of the way through that I finally had to give up. The very few frights that are there are few and far between. The story is very disjointed and the author seems to be playing, ""guess what's in my pocket"" with the readers throughout--which I find very irritating. Nothing about this seemed like a ""ghost"" story. See the movie, skip the book! Dull, dull, dull."
3,Over-hyped,This was a fine novel but it didn't love up to the reviews that I had read beforehand. Go in with no expectations and it should be a good read.
2,Very disappointed!,"We purchased this camera for my son's Christening and were very disapointed. The picture quality was extremely poor,we ended up getting pictures of our special event from our guests since the digitals were so grainy.One of the features that attracted us to the EasyShare was the ability to recharge the battery on the dock, however the life of the rechargable battery was extremely short. We were not able to take more than 8 or 10 pictures before the battery went dead.I gave this camera 2 stars because I did like the camera design, easy of use and number of editing features. Unfortunately these features are not enough to outweigh the fact that the pictures produced were useless even on a superior HP Photo Printer."
1,Big Disgrace,"This camera/docking station is a big let down. It has mood swings. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. The driver even resulted in an XP blue screen a number of times (This is a sign of a poorly written driver)...I strongly suggest that you avoid going anywhere near this product."
1,Pure Garbage-don't waste your time!,This book has absolutely no plot at all. The sex scenes in this book are actually stomach churning. The characters in this book are a bunch of immorals with no redeeming qualities. It's like a bad porn movie with no plot!!!! This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read!!
2,1/2 way thru analysis,"After reading how highly regarded this book is, I decided to buy it. Enthusiastic with the location of stories, I couldn't wait to start reading. Unfortunately the first few stories were nothing brilliant or even what I expected of a Noirish genre writing. I've already skipped 2 stories because the first couple of pages into the stories did not hold my interest. Honestly, I'm disappointed with the book so far. To it's credit, I'm only 1/2 or so into it, and do intend to finish reading it. One writer did make an impact with a premise that was fantastically new and alive. Thomas Morrissey, Can't Catch Me. This was a piece that I will remember from the compilation, whereas the others will probably be forgotten."
1,Worst collection I've ever read,"Usually I don't make the effort to review books on Amazon. However, this book was such a huge disappointment (and my expectations weren't that high), I felt I had to warn others.These stories are selected more because they are set in Brooklyn than anything else. One or two were too vile for me to finish, and I don't shy away from violence. Others were just too poorly written for one reason or another: generic, boring, product placement (for an Upper West Side restaurant, no less.) Further, many of them can't really be described as noir.Save your money."
3,not enough noir,"Like the little girl with the curl, when they're good they're very good, and when they're bad, well..... Some of these stories just don't qualify as noir or even noir-ish. I wish there had been more by Pete Hammill."
4,Ghost Squad wont disappear,"I had low expectiaons for my $[...] investment but was suprised. There may only be 3 levels but with different paths in each it does not get old. Also it is refreshingly difficult even in ""easy"" mode but with ulimited continues can be completed by the most novice player. Great 2 player fun as well!"
2,No the best,I was looking for a decent shooting game for Wii. Clearly not the best brely decent. Game is over pretty fast. Not many missions and you kinda just play them over and over
4,Like a Virgin,"This game is like a virgin. The first time you play it, its short and not very good, but the more you play it the better it gets. As you play each level over, you get higher difficulties: more targets, different paths to choose, more difficult bosses to defeat. Also, as you play you get higher ranks, and with ranks come unlocked weapons and ""outfits"". Its a great game if you have 15 minutes you want to kill."
4,Serves my purpose,"There are times when I prefer the tradtional sheet protectors like these rather than the more common ones where you simply slide sheets in, usually from the top. Unfortunately, these are becoming more difficult to find. A box of 100 will last me a couple of years, at the minimum, and I had even more difficulty finding these this time around. Regarding the product, they are a bit light-weight compared to ones I've used previously. However, they will suit my purpose fine. The protectors are clear and smooth as glass. I wouldn't hesitate to order again if/when the need arises."
1,There's better available,"If you manage land, there are better sources on monitoring and building soil health with Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) testing and treating. You don't even need a whole book on the subject.Despite liking and working with the CEC view of soil, I abandoned this book when the tone of voice just got too irritating. It's a kind of ""Gee, those scientist types don't know jack! Looky here, you can larn more than them in your own living room!""The editorialising is smug, irrelevant and alienating. Seek out the information without the we're-so-smart stuff."
5,Great reel,"Compared to anything in the BigBox stores, this one far exceeded the quality available. I am very happy with this purchase."
4,Hose-anna!,"After years of using, breaking and replacing those cheap plastic freestanding models, I finally wised up. This model assembles easy, is easy to use and move around the garden, and it appears to be built to last. I bought it at the end of the growing season, so I can't rate performance in the area of leaking from key connections or the lasting ease of winding and unwinding the hose. Only giving it 4 stars because it hasn't even gotten one year of serious use. Check with me next November.The only criticism I can give now is that the tires give off a nasty odor, but that will dissipate over time. The tires on my new generator have the same odor. Both were made in China, maybe that's how tires smell in China!"
4,Would purchase again,I was a little disappointed to find out that the hose had to run over the reel and wasn't accomodated within the reels. It is sturdy enough to handle 300 feet of hose as advertised.
3,Good player - Bad battery,"I bought this player well over a year ago. I have not had one problem with the player itself. The picture is great and the sound is good. The battery never lasted very long though. It developed ""memory"" and won't last more than 10 minutes. I may invest in another batter and try it again, but am just as happy using the car adapter to play it. It's a lot lighter that way!"
1,Lousy,Lousy product. I used it one time and after a few months went to use it again and it would not work.
5,A Well Researched Work...,"Mr. Vogt is a wonderful source of knowledge when it comes to World War II history, especially when dealing with the Nazis. He taught a class at my university last year on the Holocaust and showed us all so many different facets of this terrible event than could ever be unearthed without serious research.This work is useful in understanding how the eastern areas dealt with their territories at the conclusion of the war. Again what is made most abundantly clear is Mr. Vogt's lengthy academic research into this area. This work makes it easier for all of us to understand a specialized area of history that has been so far unjustly ignored."
1,poor quality,"I ordered these sheets from another website. The quality is soooo poor. First of all, the sheets say ""Go Team Go"" instead of the team name so the only thing specific to the team is the pillowcase. They are very thin jersey fabric -- like an undershirt. You can see straight through them. The so-called ""fitted"" sheet does not fit the mattress. They come off the bed when my son sleeps on them. They come out of the dryer a wrinkled mess. I recommend you buy a better quality plain white sheet and just get some team shams. I wish I had...."
2,This book is tiny and should be priced at about 10 dollars.,"This book does have some great stuff but look at the physical dimensions of it. It's pocketsize, and if I had known this I would never have shelled out that much cash for it. It has pictures from the classic magazine ""Physique Pictorial"", but you can get a 3 volume hardback collection of everything in PP on here for about 36 dollars. Just a warning. If you don't mind paying that much cash for a pocketsize book, go for it. There is great stuff in here. Truly classic."
2,Not worth it,I love the cologne but the body wash left me itchy and dry. Plus this leaves a very faint scent so if you're thinking like I did that you'll get that great Reaction smell then think again. I'll stick to Every Man Jack Body wash.
1,I want my old phone back.....,"I expect quality transmission in a phone and from day one with this model it has been a lose lose situation for me and the person I am talking to. The person on the other end always says the same thing - ""you sound really far away or I can barely hear you"". For me, there is a continuous hiss and an echo when I speak. Despite the sticking key pad, our old Panasonic cordless is superior to this phone. For now, I dial out using the new phone and conduct the call on the old phone. I still need a new phone - the Soutwestern Bell phone has got to go! It's too late for me, but save yourself the headache (literally from all the hiss in your ear) and select another cordless phone."
4,One step behind by Henning Mankell,The story line always follows Wallander perspective as he lives it. Sometimes the plot takes a back seat in order to feel and see events from his eyes.
5,amazing...as usual...,"steven wilson is simply a genius. He cant help it, he just is. The cd is amazing, a must have, buy it now..."
4,PT boys deliver the goods,"Bleak stuff, to be sure, but the subject of techno-sensory overload has long been a Steve Wilson theme. A fan since 'Signify', I've often wished their aggressive moments weren't so few and far between; the metal infusion suits me fine. My only criticism is that the last two cuts seem ""tacked on"" and the big choruses, by that point, a tad predictable. I withhold one star solely because I set the bar impossibly high for these guys."
3,Good but not great,"I agree with another reviewer who felt that Steven Wilson might be spreading himself too thin. His creative efforts are being dispersed amongst all of his numerous collaborations. Though I admire his musical overactivity, I believe it has affected the latest PT release this time around. The songs in general are good but not great. Lacking any real memorable moments. For a band that has set such high standards, this one falls a little short."
1,Disappointed with first few listens maybe it gets better?,"Have to say am most disappointed with my first few listens of this CD. After reading a few reviewers who raved about this band I went out and bought this cd. I find it really hard to listen to. For me there is nothing that reaches out and grabs you. Sure I am sure they are great muso's but they need to work on there songwriting to make it more listenable in my opinion. Its all a bit wishy washy and drab, could do with the occasional heavy riff or a change of pace to keep you interested. Obviously not for me, much better prog metal out there IMO."
3,Not my cup of tea,"Porcupine Tree: excellent musicianship, vocals, etc. It's just not my cup-of-tea so to speak, a shade too negative for me. I love dark but negative is something totally different. I rated it three stars to be as neutral as possible since the work itself is excellent but just not my taste."
5,The No-Diet Diet,"Dr Paula Baillie-Hamilton has thoroughly researched the ever-hot topic of what she defines as ""Chemical Calories."" In other words, the pesticides and hormones and other chemicals passed onto our bodies through food and our environments. In this book, the Dr. details easy ways to choose foods low in chemical calories, make simple changes in your home or environments, and supplements that aid in reducing chemical calories. Why would you want to reduce your chemical calories? By doing so, you naturally help your body to repair its ""Slimming System"" which aids in helping you to lose weight and change your body shape without going on severe food restriction diets.Overall it is an informative read and Paula has the research to back it up. If you even follow 2 or 3 of the 30 tips summarized at the end of the book, you will be on your way to better health and helping your body naturally stay at its slimmest."
3,Bizarre formatting issue,"It's worth the price to have all the scripts for Fawlty Towers, but be warned that the Kindle formatting includes weirdly inconsistent font sizes. The font ranges from microscopic to HUGE for no reason. Adjusting the font size on my Kindle made the huge print larger, and did not impace the tiny print at all. This is the only book I've ever downloaded that had such an issue. Interestingly, I sent Fawlty Towers to my Kindle For PC and it reads just fine; no variations in font at all. Weird.Amazon Customer Service was great, but the best they could do was offer a refund after first suggesting I delete and reinstall the book and if that didn't work, rebooting my Kindle. Since every thing else is just fine, the problem is with the book, not my Kindle.Five stars for content, one star for format, averaging three stars."
2,Flood Lights,"I like the ""true"" light from these bulbs but they have a very short life - several months at most. I was disappoined at how they did not live up to the ""life"" advertized on the box. I would not recomment these GE bulbs."
5,I have a copy.....,and am giving this one as a gift to a friend who wants to learn how to bake with yeast!
3,"Excellent book, but his newer ones are better","I'd really only recommend the newer books that he's done. They have a lot of updates on the formulas in this book, which was revolutionary in its time, but has been far surpassed by ""Apprentice"" and ""Artisan."""
4,New Scooby Doo!,"If you have enjoyed the series of new Scooby Doo movies releases in the past few years (Witch's Ghost, Zombie Island, Legend of the Vampire) you will enjoy these episodes from the new Scooby Doo series currently airing on Cartoon Network. The stories in this series are fairly simple but likeable anyway, focusing on the antics of Shaggy and Scooby. Having seen every incarnation of Scooby and pals from Scooby Doo, Where are You? to the 13 Ghosts of Scooby Doo, this series definitely holds it's own and even surpasses some of the classic Scooby series (most notably ""the Scooby & Scrappy Show"").Buy it, rent it, watch it...if you are a Scooby fan, you will like it!"
4,still relevant,"This brief little book explains Doctor John Diamond's ""Behavioral Kinesiology"" and presents the muscle testing protocols used by David Hawkins, MD, PhD, as the basis for his work ""Power Versus Force."" Useful for people interested in applied kinesiology."
2,Don't buy the audio CD,"This review applies to the audio version, read by the author. Many authors feel that they are the logical choice to read their own works--they wrote it, they felt it, they know where all the pregnant pauses should fall. I can think of many examples where this is true, but not in this case.Ms. Smith reads every word with the same inflection-- no change in tone or volume, no dramatic emphasis, no pausing for effect. The comings and goings of her neighbors, the dramatic onset of her period, or the unexpected death of her brother, all are intoned with equal lack of affect. When the listener's mind begins to wander incessantly, it's time to hit the ""stop"" button. Maybe I'll try to read the book later, given the generally positive reviews otherwise."
3,"Overall, a decent phone, but...","I've had this phone for several years, bought at a good price from an office supplies store. It works fine and originally looked just great. However, if I had known that the numbers were going to fade and the letters disappear entirely I wouldn't have bought it. That's why I plan to replace it with a Crosby retro phone when I can."
2,UNEVEN,"Totally uneven album, full of great moments followed by ludicrous moments. Johnson vocals are irregular and often very low relatively to the music."
1,It is fake,"I have used obsession for many years, i have never seen anyone as bad as this one. It is really fake. It leaks from the top, the aluminum on top pulls up with the cover. It is the worst product i have ever bought from amazon. I do not wish anyone to buy this items. I hope amazon will remove it from its list of productsObsession by Calvin Klein for Men, Eau De Toilette Spray, 4 Ounce"
5,The women love it.,The women always comment how good I smell when I wear this cologne. I hope it is not because they can't think of anything else to say!
3,Book,Waited to order my book at the last minute and it came quick and faster then what I had expected.
2,ONLY THING I LIKE IS THE LOOKS!,"What's that axium...Looks good....??? This little work of art, is great looking. It's small. It's stainless & black. It's inexpensive....and so far...IT [STINKS]!! Not easy to use, the sound quality is poor, at best. You can't just delete msgs, yet those you want deleted can be left intact...and on and on. Too bad...THOUGHT I'd purchased a winner, instead I purchased a DOG!"
1,Run don't walk - This is a scam,"This is a 13 minute video about paying to join a website to make crappy beats online. The website is crap, the samples are in .mp3 format. I have already contacted Amazon about this fraud. You will absolutely learn nothing nada... zilch, zero. Not even worth $1.99 total scam. I requesting Amazon to investigate, and ban the sellers account."
2,not satisfied,"The phone works fine, but the caller ID leaves a bit to be desired. It doesn't show if someone has recently called unless they left a message, and if there are old numbers stored, it is a pain sorting through to find the new calls. Also, sometimes the numbers on the phone don't work until the second or third time you push them. We are looking for a new one."
1,Big peice of CRAP!,"This was the worst 2.4 phone I've ever had. It echoed, had tons of static, and overall was a hunk of junk! Very unhappy with this item!"
3,"Lots of features, but short range.","I was quite excited when I found this phone to replace my amazing Nortel digital answering system, that I have had for over 7 years. This phone has a range of about 10 feet. I have a 5+ year old 900 MHz Vtech that can go everywhere on my property. GE needs to work on the range on thi smodel."
3,Works for the most part,"I used this product to shine up the rims and step bars on my ram 1500. It worked fairly decent on the bars, removing some of the rust and made them shine. On the rims however, it did an ok job. The rims are still not very shiny, and there is still rust on one of them. This product only works on rust that is barely there. I would say that you should get it if you want the shine to come back, but if you have a fair amount of rust, this is not the product to use."
2,"Did not clean rust spots on 3 year old rims, only shined them.","I used this on my 3 year old Escalade ESV Chrome rims to get some of the tiny rust dots on them off and it didn't do anything but make them shiny. Shiny is nice, but I bought it because it also says Rust remover and I only had tiny dots of rust spots, so I don't know what this would work on. Followed directions, reapplied as well and nothing. Thank goodness it's cheap. (maybe for a reason?)"
4,My mother enjoyed the memories,My mother enjoyed the memories because Frank Sinatra is her absolutely all time favorite singer and she always sings his songs.
5,Great way to introduce second language to little ones!,"The ""Teach Me"" series is a great way to introduce a second language to little ones. The songs on ""Teach Me Spanish"" are adorable and they are sung in both English and Spanish so that children can make meaningful connections between the two languages. It is not too overwhelming with lists of vocabulary and grammar. However, if a child learns even one song on the tape, she learns a list of at least 10-15 vocabulary words, grammatically correct sentence structure and fluid, correct pronunciation. Age-appropriate for even preschoolers, because it is learning through music and is fun."
4,AWESOME MAXI SINGLE AND REMIXES!,This is a great maxi single and has some great mixes..my favourite is the luscious single mix..it's short sweet and 'luscious'..:) i just get sick of long mixes that drag on and on..:) pick this one up if you like the bedtime story or human nature singles..:) thanx!
5,"A bit dated, but still the best","I've read just about all of the ""natural cleaning"" books out nowadays, and I feel this one is still the best. Not only are these recipes safe, but they WORK. From one who hates cleaning and tries to avoid it as much as possible, I actually have found myself enjoying working with peppermint-scented bathroom cleaners, just as an example.Oh, and finding the various bottles needed isn't all that hard using the internet. :)"
5,Great recipies,Everything I have tried has worked very well - but you cannot buy the bottles from her anymore as the book promotes - so that is kind of a bummer.
1,old ideas into a book,"While the writer has great ideas of cleaning products that are harmful to use in the house and what they have in them, she uses old concepts that my grandmother used 50 years ago. This book is not really all that useful in my opinion when just basic baking soda and white vinegar have been a cleaning substance for many years. This book is not original at all."
1,Terrible,"I only gave this phone one star because there is no ""0 star"" option. I bought this phone and within ONE WEEK it had deteriorated to the point where dialing required slow, hard pressing, and often still didn't register... sometimes it would pause/mute during the middle of a conversation and it randomly hung up on people. WHY IS IT SO HARD TO FIND A PHONE THAT LASTS!?!??!"
2,Its too forward,Needs bike post extention that curves to put u back from the handlebars...the seat positions you to fwrd toward handlebars...
2,No Pressure Bicycle Seat,The seat is too small and hard to fit an adult male over 200 pounds. Schwinn has been manufacturing bicycles and accessories for a long time and is a reputable brand.
3,Schwinn No Pressure Bicycle Seat,I had difficulty getting used to mine and actually replaced it with the original bike seat.I found controlling the bike uneasy and could not seem to get it adjusted properly. My wife really likes hers though.
1,Terrible seat for pedaling a bike,"All these hornless seats really stink for being able to pedal, and for keeping your butt centered on the seat. Just get a normal ergonomic seat that has thick padding under the butt and a deep groove down the middle for your man parts.Most of the positive reviews on this seat and others like it were written by people who tried this first and never tried a normal ergonomic seat with the comfort groove down the middle. Those seats give much better control and ability to pedal hard without sliding around the way you do on these seats with no center horn."
1,better in theory than in reality...it broke.,"It's been about 1-2 months of use, and one of the screw holes have already given out. The seat no longer will stay on because the screw can't stay in place. Oh, no wonder...the seat is made of plastic, of course with a lot of movement the plastic would eventually give out. Now I have a screw hole that is too big for a screw, and a seat that is no longer safe to sit on. So, this product is a big fail in my books."
2,Does not work on a mountain bike.,"I put this on a Gary Fisher mountain bike and it was impossible to ride. Problem is, in that type of bike, you use the nose on the saddle to steer yourself and without a nose there is very little traction. I had to get rid of it in the end and bought a saddle with hole in the middle like the ones they use in the Olympics."
2,Not what I expected,"I am somewhat disappointed in this product. It is ""harder"" than expected and difficult to position for comfortable riding. While my old one seemed narrow and sharp, it at least had a comfortable forward/backward feel. I'll continue to try to adjust it, but so far not impressed."
2,seat is uncomfortable,"I bought this seat to replace a Walmart bike seat that came on with the bike.The Schwinn No Pressure Bicycle Seat is too small and not shaped proportionately so that the back of your legs hit the seat and you can not ride comfortably.Also, the size is way too small for an adult.I had my teenage daughter try the seat & she felt it was too uncomfortable.So having spent $20 for the seat, I can not use it!I went back to WalMart & got a wide saddle seat & it works fine:MUCH MUCH better than this Schwinn No Pressure Bicycle Seat!What a waste of money!"
1,Seat not usable,The seat is positioned several inches too far forward rendering it unusable.There is no way to position it further back.
1,Impossible to ride with it,"Bicycle seats have the ""nose"" for a reason now I know why. This seat makes riding a bicycle a challenge, I tried every single configuration possible to make it work, but it is simply too uncomfortable to ride. I bought it thinking that it would more comfortable than a regular seat because is wider and ""noseless"", but that puts extra pressure on your buttocks bones and your arms since you are trying not to fall forward.Although if you are a fan of this design the seat looks quite nice (high quality materials) and is well trimmed."
2,Requires Adjusting,"Just got this seat and my instant reaction was ""oh my god this is aweful."" Feel like I have to keep myself from pitching off the bike face forward by using all my arm strength. Will try lowering the seat, but according to basic bicycling ergonomics, that'll make the pedals too close, and I expect trouble there. Then will look at raising the handlebars. The people that love it here all claim you have to stick with it and get the adjustments ust right. I'm willing to try - but the message to Schwinn is clear --> you need to send some documentation with this seat about how to adjust it different than your old seat. Otherwise this product will be a real clunker. It *does not* just pop on and replace the old seat at the same angles. Still, I love my manly bits enough to tool around with it a little."
1,"interesting idea, bad execution","During my cross country cycling trek earlier this year, I tried out one of those Schwinn ""no pressure"" saddles. The experiment lasted all of 5 miles as I traversed Tallahasee, FLWaste of time and $20. I know what they are trying to do - which is recreate that short-lived rocker saddle from a few years back, but putting any real torque on this thing causes one (or at least me) to slide right off it - or I'd have to set it at a bizarre angle and not really be able to sit on it. Once I hit the St Marks trail extension, I swapped out my regular saddle and left the Schwinn saddle with the groundskeeper at the St Mark's trail Trailhead. I hoped that maybe someone else can make better use of it.A for effort, F for execution.You're really better off getting a real saddle regardless of your physique."
2,not what I was hoping for.,"I tried the seat at different heights and many angles, but always felt either uncomfortable or that I was sliding forward. I'm going to see if anyone else in my family wants to give it a try. I think if my handlebars could be raised higher, which they couldn't, it might have worked."
5,Very comfortable after proper adjustments,"This is a great seat, especially for ""comfort"" bike riders. However, to really appreciate it, you need to properly adjust the seat tilt angle. If your current bike seat post has a fixed tilt-angle mount, you will probably find yourself slipping forward off this seat. Get a new seat post that allows you to use the tilt adjustment bracket that comes with the Schwinn no-pressure seat. Start with a level seat setting; then try minor tilt adjustments fore and aft to find your comfort zone. When properly set up, you will not want to ride on a conventional bike seat again."
2,Unconfortable seat,"I found it quite unconfortable. As I use to ride the bike mostly standing and lik to have the seat high enough so my legs will be stretched with the seat high. To be of some use you have to use it with a 40 deg inclination, so with this seat there is no way you can really seat on it.Meabe is a matter of getting used to it."
4,Great Seat,"This is the most comfortable seat I've ever had on a bike. As other reviews have pointed out, it does tend to put you a little too far forward. My solution was to get a layback seat post. Yes, then more of your weight is on your arms. I ride for a workout, so this doesn't bother me. Yes, the seat is the size of a fit person's butt. If you have an oversized can, the edges of seat might be a little hard. But I'd rather have the hard parts of a seat at the edges than between my legs."
4,I like comfort!,I converted my bike to an indoor excercise bike and found that it was torture to sit on its seat. The Schwinn seat made all the difference. Now I can get my exercise and be comfortable. The only problem I found was it is short in the front and you need to really adjust it or you feel like you will slide off.
2,Schwinn No Pressure Bicycle Seat,Excellent transaction and delivery time. Seat is comfortable but there was difficulty to stabilize seat - pivoting up and down. It would need a support bracket under the seat attached to the saddle post.
4,As advertised,"Having used this bicycle seat a few times now, I can say that it is comfortable and seems to be well built. Like any of these ""no pressure"" saddles (I suspect), the ride and position does take a little getting used to. No complaints."
3,Comfy,Not bad for a beach cruiser. I felt like I would fall off the seat. It looked like it would be more comfortable than a conventional seat. It might be great for someone who has better balance.
5,Comfy,This is the most comfortable bicycle set I have ever used. I highly recommend it.you can sit for long ride and still feel comfortable.
5,Great seat for those who cannot use std seats,"I love to ride bicycles - great, low impact way to exercise.But couldn't ride (comfortably) longer than 20-30 mins due to pressure points of the regular seat.It's a different style of riding - so if you're struggling to ride with a std - log some miles first, then try switching.For me - it's great - no more soreness x 3 days after riding - AND - I can walk normal lol.Ride Safe :)"
4,A fine addition to our collection,"I will allow my 2 year old to guest review this one, and based on the fact that he requests it often, I'd say he likes it.Personally, I like Thomas Comes to Breakfast and the Sing Along Video better, but I'm not the primary audience!"
5,"keep this book as a reference if you plan on any math, science, or engineering courses","This book came in handy once I started upper-level undergraduate courses in mathematics. I went back to Zill more than any other textbook that I own, to the point where I have certain pages memorized. It's a really great resource.Highly recommended."
2,"Dry math text, hard for me to get motivated beyond grades...","Simply straight forward mathematics. Hard for a non-nerd-_by_birth to desire to crack this text. Only the grade kept me going all semester (ended with B).To be clear though, I have not yet found an interesting Diff Eq text!Good luck,"
4,Good product for the price!,"I LOVE my earmuffs! I have trouble with wind, I get an earache when it blows, so I need to have something to cover my ears. I hate hats. The only problem I have found with these is that they try to regain their original ""twisted"" shape they arrived in. No big problem, just readjust."
5,"About as ""comedic"" as Spike Lee's ""She's Gotta Have It""...","...and at least as talented a writer/director. Amazon's plot summary says Jaime Camil played ""Claudio Caballero."" That part is played by Eduardo Arroyuelo. I bought this because I thought Jaime Camil was ""tan divino"" in ""La Fea Mas Bella,"" but, as in ""La Fea,"" all of the actors offer compelling performances. Perhaps the people marketing this movie thought calling it a ""comedy"" with ""hijinks"" would make it more appealing, but the humor is dark. Very dark. And very pointed. Despite the seemingly absurd concept on which the plot turns, Kalife creates a memorable story about hope, about friendship, about transformation, and the lack thereof."
1,"Defective, bad design","The metal cover gets too hot - cannot really hold the pot using the cover. When you try to pull the plunger back - the press gets stuck inside - and finally the plunger disconnects leaving the press inside. You will have to wait for the whole thing to cool down to take the press out.These issues are specific to this model, I used to have one with the metal filter and plastic cover - it worked OK."
2,"poor customer service & thin, breakable glass","The tea pot relies on a plunger system in the stainless steel filter that can be pushed down to stop the brewing process. The plunger has a rubber gasket (ring) around it that seals the tea leaves in the bottom inch of the strainer. I take the rubber gasket off to wash after each use.Unfortunately the gasket was thrown away by mistake so I called the company to order a new one. I had to leave a message since the computer does not have any live customer service. Actually I left several messages and emails to no avail. If I wanted a new gasket, I would have to buy a whole new tea pot. In the end it made no difference because the glass tea pot cracked in the dishwasher shortly afterward.I have since purchased the FORLIFE Brew-in-Mug Extra-Fine Tea Infuser with Lid on Amazon and been very happy with it. I gave several away as Christmas gifts too and they were well received."
2,plastic strainer,I think highly of your product except for the PLASTIC strainer. I'm sure you know that heat (liquid heat) will leach chemicals into the water of your tea. I paid good money and cannot use the tea strainer because of your plastic insert. I'm sorry I had to write you because the design and function is great. I'll send your plastic strainer back if you'll send me a stainless steel one. ed
4,Solid,"This book should be considered as Academic Paganism, as the authors' aim is to convey knowledge about the lore and worship of the Morrigan by citing historical fact including consideration of cultural context. For individuals who have never encountered academically based writings on Paganism, this book may be a bit intimidating at first. However, the writing is clear and concise and well researched. Some ideas are a bit far fetched, but as is any branch of academe, that is to be expected when one is attempting to further knowledge and call for further research on said issue."
4,"Nice colors, handy reversibility","These decently constructed, 100% cotton sheets came in several sets of great colors, and their reversibility is a plus."
5,Great find...,"I bought these sheets to replace some extremely expensive, very high thread count sheets that I had that just didn't hold up well. They were meant as an interim replacement but they have turned out to be one of the best finds I have run across in a long time. They are very substantial, wash well, and look great. My only wish is that they came with a second set of pillowcases but I feel that way about all sheet sets."
4,love the way they look,great shoes for only $30. they are surprisingly really comfortable for just going out for the night or work but I'm on my feet all day at work so no matter what my feet usually hurt.. but i get compliments all the time on them and i love how they're so easy to just slip on and off.
5,Best darn 2 line phone for the money!,"I've burned through 4 or 5 other ""better"", more expensive, two-line cordless phones over the past 8 or 10 years and this has proven to be the best value. Sound quality, features and range. No, I don't walk around the neighborhood with it (that's what cell phones are for) but my house does have a ton of smoked glass, concrete and steel walls. Goofy brand name (does GE actually make anything small and consumer-like themselves?) and it sure doesn't look Scandinavian but it sure performs just great."
2,Didn't like the sound,"Bought and returned this phone. The microphone was weak and people complained they couldn't hear me, and the speaker was somewhat harsh. (I'm going to buy the more expensive Siemans which I used to have.)"
1,good start but goes downhill fast,"A wonderfully detailed intro with the basics well covered ( for that I give the author one gold star) . . . and then . . . nothing! The rest of the book is just a compilation of puzzles. True they are rated from beginner to expert, but not a another word of help from the author. Oh, yes. the x-wing is covered briefly, but where are the rest of the advanced techniques promised by the statement on the cover, ""Conquer the hardest puzzles of all."" If you do, you will do it on your own!! I see why there are copies for sale here for a few cents. That's about what it's worth. Too bad!!!"
1,Junk; don't buy this!,"I got this phone ... I have it for 20 Minutes and here's why it's going back:(1) the caller id dosn't ""catch"" ANY incoming calls! (i have 3 other phones on that line, including one from the same co. that show every call.)(2) it has a tiny LCD display, you will need glasses to read from it.(3) the contrast for the lcd does not work at all!(4) the caller id will only work when the phone is on the receiver, which means after or before a call. So in order to read the caller id, i have to stand directly on top of the phone, reading with lights on and my grandmother's glasses...Oh, just wait untill i start using it, the way this goes i'll come up with 10 more reasons."
1,Don't do it!!!,"I have also had this phone for a half hour, and it's going back -the display is tiny and hard to read because the contrast controls are awful. The microphone that picks up your voice in the headset is all tinny, and the ring is the most irritating high pitched ring I have ever heard!"
1,Terrible phone,I created an account here just to add a comment on this phone...DO NOT BUY...the displays on ALL four of our handsets are in various stages of disappearing. I called and complained to the company which was a waste of time. The person who I talked to was rude and completely unhelpful; she said to change the batteries! I really regret buying this phone system. A '1 star' rating is too high.
2,Seems great at first,"I was extremely happy with this as first because we have an upstairs and a downstairs and we really enjoyed using the intercom feature. Also, we really like the caller id on both handsets. Not being able to make a call from the base is a big nuisance though. My biggest problem with this phone however which makes it unusable is that I keep hearing silences on my end - similar to what you hear when the other person gets a call waiting signal. The result is that I miss a lot of the conversation because when it happens it happens rather often. While I hear the silences the person on the other side hears a loud beep. Very annoying! I see that another caller spoke of this in their review and said that when they contacted Customer Service they were told that other Customers have complained about this, so there is obviously a fault in the design. I would not recommend it and I am getting a new phone myself. What a waste!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AROUND C'MAS OF 2002. BY THE WINTER OF 2003, THE DIGITAL DISPLAYS ON BOTH THE PHONES WAS NO LONGER LEGIBLE. AND AROUND ANOTHER MONTH LATER, NOTHING WAS SHOWING UP ON THE DISPLAY ON EITHER PHONE! I CALLED AND COMPLAINED OF COURSE AND THE LADY I TALKED TO AT CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS VERY RUDE. SHE TOLD ME I COULD MAIL BOTH HANDSETS IN, AT MY COST, AND OF COURSE PAY FOR THEM TO FIX THE HANDSETS. AND PAY TO HAVE THEM SHIPPED BACK TO ME. I JUST TOLD HER THAT NO I WASN'T DOING THAT AND I WOULD JUST NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN. BUT, PLEASE, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. I HAVE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE SAME PROBLEM, WITH THE DIGITAL DISPLAY, MESSING UP ON THESE CHEAP PHONES!"
2,Returning it,"As described in another user's review, the audio drops out periodically, while on the other end an annoying beep is heard. It sounds as if the user is pressing one of the keypad buttons. During a conversation with a Verizon customer service representative, the phone did this numerous times. I imagine the person on the other end thought I was just being a jerk.The handsets also echo the mic so you hear yourself talking. This is annoying as well.It's a nice looking phone, but this is clearly a low-end product. We are going to take it back and try to find something else."
4,Good but not perfect,"This phone has a number of terrific features. The speaker quality is excellent and the handsets are small, light, easily programmed, and easy to use. Memory numbers are shared and only have to be entered once. Also, the extensions can be named, which is nice. The three drawbacks: 1) the phones only have a 10-number memory, 2) the base does not have a memory dial option (even though it has an lcd window), and 3) the ring choices are unusual and non-traditional. All in all, though, an excellent set-up."
3,Good Phone but not Complete,"I asked for this phone as part of my wedding registry and was excited to receive this as my first gift.The phone works fine for the few days that I've (We've) had it for all that it is designed to do but for some reason the caller ID can not be reviewed on the base unit. Once the call is picked up by my answering machine the name and number disappears forever. I want to be able to see some sort of light flashing at least to let me know someone had called before I see who called on one of the two corless phones in the other rooms.Now I have to reinstall my trusty called ID box with the little red light. I am probably going to return it, and get one that has a better caller ID feature and also one with an integrated answering machine. It would be great to have only one box on my counter, as I was trying to stream line everything with this request in the first place.Overall pretty good but could easily be better."
3,Fading Features,"This phone has good features. However, they soon fade with time. The letters or numbers in the display window (which is one of its best feaures) fades out and can not be retrieved. There is now an echo in the phone giving you the impression that you are sitting in a cave. You may only store 10 numbers in the memory. The last quirk is that you have to push the talk button to move from feature to feature which can be confusing and annoying.However, it's always on sale and the price seemed right at the time. I wouldn't invest in this phone again."
3,Disappointing!,"Purchased these gazebo lights in the hope of entertaining guests outside for a poker party, unfortunatly you couldn't see hand in front of face!!!Maybe Xmas decorative lighting will be more appropiate."
5,Great product.,My 4 year old son loved this to add to his equipment collection. I would recommend this item for any young boy.
3,Could've been better,"This movie was okay. I'm just tired of the ""independent woman"" who leaves a good man because she's insecure with herself. Okay acting, but Catherine's English accent came out in a few scenes, (she's supposed to be an American mother.) The ending was not ""movie worthy"" and understated. I guess the whole movie was written to be somewhat understated, like the relationship with the main character, Catherine, and the younger man. Very predicable movie. Well made. Decent acting. Not an Oscar worthy movie, but a decent watch on a weekend."
4,better than your average life after divorce movies,"Sweet and unpretentious with a dash of sexy. Better than a lot of the romantic comedies out there right now mostly because it wasn't flashy or perfect, and the people were grown ups acting like grown ups."
5,Vitale does it again!,"Joe Vitale does at least three things better than just about anyone: 1) He makes people rich. 2) He makes people famous. 3) He writes books that show you how to do it now! This is his best book to date and will go down as a classic! Get it now and Joe will do for you what he does for everyone! Kevin Hogan, Author of The Psychology of Persuasion: How to Persuade Others to Your Way of Thinking"
3,Aite,Turtle wax was aite. Didn't really fix my scratches but I guess it is less noticeable now. If your scratches are small it might work though
2,work on some blemishes,my older can of this stuff worked wonders but this newer stuff doesnt seem to do the trick i dont know if they changed the formula or what but it seems some stuff i try to use this on it doesnt work but my older can would of
2,Not a fan,"I'm still not sophisticated enough for Shakespeare I suppose. My son loved it for his required high school reading, but I didn't get it."
4,A Midsummer's Night Dream,"It was wonderful to read some Shakespeare again, and what a wonderful story to start with. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
3,Mikayla Maroney is not impressed,"A nice quick read with lots of laughs, it's obviously early Shakespeare. I recently finished Macbeth and foolishly expected the depth and themes of existentialism to be present in Macbeth to be reflected in Midsummer Night's Dream as well. This being said, I enjoyed it... a lot. Not so bad for an Lit grade"
5,Always a joy,You cannot go wrong with this classic. It's one of my favorites and it never gets old. A great read!
3,take 54!,"Okay, first time I decided to read a script and I think it will be the last time. It really didn't bring anything more to the story but maybe it was just this format.What can I say except we all use the lines from Shakespeare and we always will."
4,A helpful book,"I agree with the comments of the previous reviewer. A useful little book, given that press usage is so often our main exposure to contemporary written Arabic when we start to use the language. It's certainly not a book for beginners, though. It's also intended for class use; when I used, I used it solo but feel I might have got a lot more out of it with a teacher.There is an audio cassette available through Edinburgh University Press to accompany this book. Unfortunately it is tied to the latter part of the book, and is less of an aid than one might hope. I used the book - the cassette remained unlistened to. The cassette is probably a useful tool for a teacher, though."
5,Review for Seashells by the seashore,I bought this book for my 4 year old granddaughter. I wanted to get her a book about the beach because we are going back to the ocean again this year. We both love this book. I love the illustrations and we both learn all the names ofthe different shells. Would highly recommend this book!
2,Broken Hitch!,Awesome truck but the hitch broke within five minutes of my four year old son playing with it! If you have a little boy you know the importance of a hitch for hooking trailers and hauling loads. The Bruder trailer was hooked onto the Unimog truck and when he tipped the load back the hitch snapped right off - which is one of the most important features of the truck. Very disappointing when you spend extra for quality and it doesn't deliver.
5,Sturdy little truck,"My 4-year-old wanted a street sweeper for Christmas, and he got this truck with the street sweeper attachment that is made by Bruder (as well as the snow plow attachment). The truck is great, there aren't any little parts that break off and need to be fixed by mom every 5 minutes. It's got great rubber tires and it's a nice size-- it is frequently seen hauling other toys around our living room. Bruder is definitely my go-to brand when I need a gift for a little boy, and you can't go wrong with this unimog."
3,Purchased to play videos from my CANON XL1S Camera,"This little box aint so bad, It plays my recorded Tapes to my computer for editing, since my PRO grade CANON XL1S That refuses to without eating tapes, BUYER BEWARE! The used stuff can cost you more in the short term than you think, My CANON XL1S will cost me 350.00 to 500.00 plus shipping to get professionally repaired, this little Canon OPTURA 200MC save me from losing what might be the lastOf my KIDS Sports games. So If you have ISSUES with your CANON XL1S or got burned like I did, this will play then into your computer throughout the 1394 DV in/output cord although not the same resolution it will save your MEMORIES FROM BEING TOTALLY LOST!"
2,floppy end of fin,"I'm not very pleased with my fins and perhaps I didn't read that the floppy ends of the fins would be hard plastic, but because they are there is not much ability to move me in the water. If this was mentioned at their site I missed it."
4,Cute Backpack!,"This is a cute little backpack, and does come with a free coin purse and little mirror. But there is no unicorn on, in, or with this bag, so I don't know where they get the unicorn idea. The backpack has a pegasus named Star Catcher on it."
2,Worked OK for 1st 15 months..then randomly loses power,I bought this phone about 17 months ago for my work-at-home office..I wish I could plug my headset into the base unit as I sometimes forget to put handset back on re-charger cradle..and I am then forced to use speaker on conf calls.The phone worked well for the first 15 months and only lately...(Now that the warranty is up) has it been randomly dieing durng a call.The base unit simply loses power and I must pull out and then re-connect the power at the back of the phone to restore operation...By then I've lost other party..I will not buy a GE phone again...
4,Good phone for the price,"This phone works great, except for one downside: the handset speaker does not get very loud. This can be a problem in noisy environments, unless used with the included headset. The headset and speakerphone both work perfectly well - well enough that people don't notice the difference.All of the phone's features were simple to set-up and use, making for an overall enjoyable experience."
3,The brilliant Eduard Artemiev,"Composer Eduard Artemyev worked on soundtracks for over 140 Russian/Soviet films and he is most known in the West for contributing to the films of Andrei Tarkovsky.This appears to be a professional Folk Records bootleg of either the 1999 Electroshock (Russia) or 1990 Torso Kino (Netherlands) album. These are out of print but can be found for $60 used. There is a French version on Milan Records for about 21 euro. Sound quality seems decent but it's not a pressed CD-ROM so longevity could be an issue. (Hence 3 stars instead of 5.)Until another (official) version is released in North America or Russia, this is the best us non-collectors can get.Listing:1. Stalker: Theme2. Starker: Train3.

1,bends even in sand,"I used this when I first got it to transplant sweet corn plants. I have sandy soil and when it was wet and freshly tilled the fiskars bulb planter worked great. I went to use it for planting bulbs in my sandy ,but dry and a little compacted soil and the thin steel sides bent over when I pushed it in the soil. Now I can't get it bent back into shape to be strong enough to use at all. I thought by spending a few more dollars I would get quality. I can't recommend this due to the thin metal sides that can't withstand the pressure required to push it into the ground."
5,"Comfortable, cute, not too short","I just started running and heard about running skirts. I looked at alot of them online. I'm not a size 2 yet (maybe alot more running, then I will be), so I didn't want anything that would ride too low on the hips or be too short. Several of the skirts I looked at were pretty short, but this one is a good length, it's VERY comfortable, and it's so cute. It's something I wouldn't feel self concious about wearing in public. I'm going to get more in other colors!"
2,Documentary Leaves Viewer Disappointed,"While ""Portrait of a Swashbuckler"" features interviews with a number of people who knew and worked with screen idol Errol Flynn, it is a poor effort. The narration is over-acted; all of the clips from Flynn's movies are in black-and-white (even from color films, such as ""The Adventures of Robin Hood); and the viewer is left with the feeling that ""Portrait of a Swashbuckler"" is a low-budget affair. Unfortunately, no better documentary on the life of Errol Flynn exists. END"
1,"Amazon doesn't allow a negative rating, so I gave it 1 Star","Alan Barbour did not cite a single reference in the book. It is entirely his opinion and the reason it was published was to hide the truely devastating epidemic of Lyme and related diseases. It is NOT based on his own scientific evidence. Any physician that uses book as a resource and can't see thru the bologna, is a moron.So, this book is for MDs incapable of original thought and tells very few truths about Lyme disease."
1,Don't buy. Lacking in scientific support,This book tells a lop-sided viewpoint about Lyme disease. It is not suported by scientific references nor a bibliograpy. Maybe his family and friends will support this type of book - but patients and docs deserve better.If you are looking for scientific enlightenment or an education about the disease - this book is a Zero.
5,Pod Light,I use this light inside my coat closet in my hallway. This is the second one I have had and I love them.
4,"Great, but...","Overall this book is GREAT. The information in the book is very thorough and my dog loves everything I've made using this book. However, for the main meal recipes, they are all kind of no-brainers. What the author could have done was just provide a list of ratios - so much meat, so much grain, so much vegetables, so the cook could mix-and-match ingredients. I could see people who are DEPENDENT on sticking to recipes being very limited by feeling they have to make these dishes exactly as spelled out, but in reality the author could have provided better instruction on being flexible as long as the right food-type ratios are stuck to."
1,Have these people ever read about the 1930s?,"It's not like I'm expecting much, but I don't think rap or rock and roll were around during the 1930s. Yeah, I suppose we can overlook that. As well as how everyone looks more like an extra on OC than a denizen of the 30s. And the acting - yeah, I guess we can look over the fact that no one has ever heard of such a craft. I'm sorry to be such a Grinch, but this movie was bad. As in ""worse than Sharktopus or Plan 9"" bad. There are better Christmas movies. ""A Christmas Story,"" for example. Or ""The Grinch Who Stole Christmas."" Hell, watching the yule log burn would be better than watching this bad movie again."
2,Keep looking,"My wife and I bought this setup in hopes of having more phones located throughout the house. That part worked out well. After approx. 3 months the caller id screens, which also displays the menu, quit displaying anything. Phones still work, you just can't see the number you are dialing, no big deal had to do this for so many years before. The volume must be constantly adjusted, it appears they have a feature built in to go to midrange volume everytime you answer the phone, not a bad idea, but as someone with a slight hearing problem it is quite annoying to have to increase the volume everytime I talk to someone. I tend to use my cell phone for local calls instead of the home phone now."
1,Junk,"We bought this phone to go with our VoIP system. Like the other reviews, there is a beep on the other end and severe echo. I can't even stand calling home to talk to the family because I hear myself over and over. echo echo echo. If I wanted echo, I would go to echo canyon."
5,So much fun!,"While my daughter isn't yet old enough to play with this, I'm building her puzzle collection and I knew this would be a great addition. Shirt and pant puzzle pieces are interchangeable which teaches matching, versatility, hand-eye coordination, dexterity. Too cute! Same great quality that you would normally expect from Melissa & Doug products."
2,Tangled mess,"I bought this to take care of a tangled fur problem on my cat. She suffered an injury to her spine and as a result, can't groom herself in back and the fur tends to get tangled and clumped. Of course, she also now weighs about 300# but that's besides the point. Based on other reviews, I thought this stuff must be amazing.. well it did absolutely nothing for her fur. I also tried it on my own bedhead, I have longer hair and tends to tangle in back even with regular conditioner.. it really didn't work that well. It's hard for me to believe that people are having some miraculous results with it... maybe my tube was defective. Anhow, the cat fur crisis was solved with the furminator..."
4,Garrison Keillor meets Stephen King!,"Fans of the odd need look no further, Nude in Tub is your book. Dark humor abounds in these stories of small-town life viewed from a weird and often warped perspective. Written in a style that might be called Garrison Keillor meets Stephen King, the author creates a world of rather humdrum characters who just happen to have a few quirks. This isn't Lake Wobegon! The residents tend to behave in rather bizarre fashion and suffer grotesquely bad luck. In fact, grotesque may be the best word to describe this book. Just understand that in this instance ""grotesque"" is good!While not a book for everyone, those who enjoy fiction written with a disturbing and unsettling sense of humor should take a chance on Nude in Tub. I was hooked from the very first line of the first chapter, ""To die in winter in a far northern place is to become a storage problem."""
1,Disaster!,"This phone is terrific, except for the HORRIBLE SCREECHING NOISE that occurs every few times I use it. It's truly awful, ear-piercing screeching. And when another call is coming in when I'm already on the phone, my conversation is interrupted for several seconds where I just can't hear the other person anymore. This phone is the absolute pits."
5,Scoutmaster Praise,This book is well thought out and it has a wealth of knowledge. It can break you out of that same ole routine and get you thinking about other opportunities to challenge and lead young men.
4,Excellent resource for Scoutmasters,"I just moved up from ASM to Scoutmaster and this book was recommended to me. It is a great resource -- lots of real-world advice in there. You can read it cover to cover now, or just read the sections that apply to you at a particular point in time."
5,Very Informative,"This is one of the books you should get when you're going to the Philippines. It is a very long book filled with good detailed facts. The photographers who took the pictures got very good shots of the Philippines. Another good thing about this book is that is has very good information when your touring the Philippines in the back of the book. It tells you information about the weather, lodging, holidays and festivals, what should be worn, and even how to speak basic Tagalog (the official language of the Philippines). There's a lot of things I haven't mentioned. If you want a good quality guidebook on the Philippines, then you should try this book!"
3,Caveat Emptor,"Though I greatly appreciate the beauty of Wolf Kahn's color work, I attended a Wolf Kahn workshop and found he was not a very good teacher. In response to a question on learning about color, he stated that it is impossible to teach how to use color. Despite his background with Hans Hoffman, he was unable or not willing to articulate his knowledge on color, but he does like to talk about pastel."
3,Rash 1,"WHEN I BOUGHT IT, I THOUGHT IT WAS BIGGER AND HAVE MORE PIECES. I FOUND THE INSTRUCTIONS EASY TO READ. I THOUGHT IT WAS THE MAIN GAME NOT AN UPGRADED EDITION TO THE GAME.THANK YOU, NEIL G. EVANS"
3,Average,"I wouldn't say it's the best, but not the worst either. And because it's mostly natural, I'm sold. I think it does increase the shine of my hair, and it smells decent. I'm no hippy but after reading on the EPA website about what we have in our homes, I don't want toxic stuff around my family, so I will give up the salon brands for health. Babies have died from swallowing beauty products, such as hair conditioner, so this Burt's Bees stuff rocks. I got the ""baby bee"" baby wash and milk lotion and my daughter's mild excema is completely gone, but like I said it was mild (though VERY persistent)."
3,Decent,"This is a decent begginers camera. It has NO optical zoom, only digital and the digital zoom is worthless. It has a really low picture quality, 1.3 MP. I bought this camera for $130 or so dollars a long time ago. It has done a good job for me for a long time but I just bought a new camera to replace it. I don't know about other camera's in this price range but this one is decent. Nice big LCD and easy to use menus."
5,THE BEST EVER NOW ON CD FROM HAYDNHOUSE@COMCAST.NET,"I'm still dreaming of a CD of this legendary mono LP. It is by far the best account (although highlights) of the Swan Lake Suite. The sound is super. Why can't they record like this in stereo. Of all the Ormandy recordings since this 1950's mono recording, this is the best. Please, please put this on CD, I know I will. Nothing like having it transferred professionally. One can only dream. You have to hear this performance for yourself.BULLETIN: I FOUND THIS PERFORMANCE ON CD TODAY TRANFERRED PROFESSIONALLY FROM HAYDNHOUSE@COMCAST.NET. NOW I CAN DIE IN PEACE. CHECK OUT ALL THE GEMS NEVER BEFORE AVAILABLE ON CD."
4,Behind the scenes,"For ""Days"" fans, this is a good read. Julie and Doug have been around Salem for centuries. Now see their private lives and how they interract with Days of Our Lives cast."
3,Good starter kit,"One clamp fell apart as I was taking it out of the box. You get a lot of clamps for a cheap price. Don't have high expectations, you get what you pay for."
1,The worst electronic device I have purchased...ever!,"DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE! Mostly, it does not work. Here are a FEW of the main (and fatal) problems:1.) Sometimes it just doesn't ring (interference?).2.) It hangs up on people.3.) It's battery went dead after 1 month and won't recharge.Note that it was RARELY left off of the hand set.4.) Without Caller ID the time does not get set.In fact, I have the receipt and am still going to throw it away...I certainly don't want another one of these! Worthless."
1,Bad Phone,"This is the worst phone I have ever purchased. I would not recommend wasting your money on this one. You cannot hear very well with it, it does not charge for very long use."
1,Don't buy this phone.,"... It has never worked well since we bought it. It has terrible static, at all times. Everything sounds tin-can-ish. And turn on the microwave, well, let's not go there. I really want to return this terrible phone..."
1,Ear Muffs,"They are almost impossible to put on. I can't get them uncurled, and the adjustment doesn't stay the way I put it. I regret buying them because I'll never be able to wear them."
2,You get what you pay for,"The headpiece is cheap plastic , not soft on the ear. Would return, but, will keep and wear only in an emergency."
2,They are warm but...,"While they are very warm, they are very difficult to untangle each time you want to put them on and if you move a lot they will try to slip off your head and roll up in to a little ball again. I would not buy these again."
3,"Not the Ho'oponopono I was looking for, but...","I thought I was buying a book on the Ho'oponopono technique I read about on the internet which operates by one taking 100% responsibility upon them-selves on whatever problem needs solving in another's life. What I got instead is a book on Ho'oponopono a group problem solving process traditionally used in a Hawaiian family setting.If that's what you're looking for then I guess it's a good book for that. I would say that anyone that is involved in any kind of counseling should take it upon themselves to read this book. The author interviews a bunch of councilors that use Ho'oponopono in their counseling and shows how they have integrated it into non-family situations and nontraditional cultures.Even parents would be well advised to read at least a chapter from this book to discover a new way of bringing their families closer together, while resolving conflicts."
1,Text Book vs Practical,"For myself, this book wasn't what I was seeking. This book though may be exactly what someone who is coming from an academic standpoint is looking for, it did not serve the purpose I wanted. I wanted something written in laymans terms that I could learn more about the process and perhaps even expand on my knowledgee. This is written like a clinical text. Not written to expand and give process knowledge."
1,Hard to hold,These spread apart as you are trying to carry and walk with them. Sand spreads outs hurts fingers. Would not suggest
5,Zupreem and Parrots,I feed only Zupreem the birds love it and my Vet Dr. Scott McDonald say's it is the best to feed along with fresh fruit and veggies
1,"Not double feature, Not Comedy...","Maybe, maybe I would have laughed if I was twelve years old.Maybe, maybe the liberal butt shots would have equated too a T&A; movie again when I was twelve years old.Not a complete waste, I have now seen it and can warn others not to waste their time or money.Amazon owns the rights to NOTDOT.NOTDOT is hilarious(5 stars) and is how you re-dubb on the fly for comedy effect. On the fly is key in previous sentence.Google NOTDOT then read Wikipedia entry.NOTDOT has been re-released on DVD and two sequels were made(also released on DVD).Fair warning NOTDOT and sequels are intentionally offensive for comedy effect.Whats up Tiger Lily is funny re-dubbed by Allen, not on the fly if you get my drift (3.5 stars)Good luck."
2,Old school approach 12 step few of overeating,I had to read this book for a weight loss program and see its value for someone who is bulimic anoexic or a food addict however I do not agree with the author's instructions to foc=r
2,Elephant in the Room,"As a Buddhist practitioner of some 36 years, I have to respectfully say that this is a too-long, not-very-interesting, and (worst of all) not very enlightening film, IMO. I don't like to speak ill on any Buddhist effort, because we need more of this kind of film, but have to point out here that this is probably not ultimately going to be that useful of an effort to most of us. It does bring out the realist in me, as some reviewers have mentioned, but the result is this review."
1,i did not like these,i thought these were very scratchy on the skin that made me not want to where them again :(
5,Only if you are ready.,"Goldsmith's ideas are fleshed out well in _The Art of Spiritual Healing_. I think that it follows well from _The Art of Meditation_. These ideas are not for people that are stuck in some sort of doctrinal stagnation. Those who rely on spouting cliches and confuse participation in rituals with spirituality will only be confused. The proverb that ""The teacher appears when the student is ready"" applies here. This book is for open minded seekers only."
3,Joel is really wordy,I am reading this text with 8 others ata Saturday 6to 7pm reading. Joel reallygets wordy. I prefer reading EckhartTolle and hope the group goes backto another of his books.
3,Good primer,"The topic of this book is a very interesting one, and the book itself does delivery what promised.However, while some chapters contain pristine accounts of how disorders concerning mood and anxiety are linked to the evolution of rank and affiliation traits, others (schizophrenia and borderline disorder) fail to explain symptoms from an evolutionary perspective. Furthermore, Stevens grounds his work more in psychoanalytical psychology (Jung, Bowlby) than in psychiatry.Overall, this is a good primer, and some chapters might also be included in undergraduate syllabi in an evolutionary psychiatry classes."
4,"Very good, but please","This book would be taken more seriously by more people if the author wasn't so obviously anti-Republican. He even criticizes architecture as ""Nixon-era"". This is ridiculous and waters down his very important message about what's wrong with they way we eat and even more importantly, what's wrong with America. I just think the problem is bigger and more expanisve than the Republican party. By the by, I almost always vote Democrat."
3,The dark side of Fast Food Nation,"At first reading, this book is a powerful and moving call for people who care about their health, environment, and the treatment of workers to rise up and stop pulling into the McDonald's drive thru. I have to say after reading this book I was very upset at the direction that America has gone since the beginning of the story in the early 1900's.One thing that bothers me is that the author claims that he began the book with the intention of it being a tongue-in-cheek look at American culture, but that the actual practices of the fast food industry led him in a different direction. I suspect his real intention from the beginning was to write the 21st century version of Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle"".I was frankly bummed out after reading this, and I felt helpless to do anything about the problems showcased in the book."
5,McCrap No More!,"You know how you know something is bad and you kind of make up your mind to avoid it but after a while you forget it or don't think about it because it's just too convenient and hell, everyone else is doing it and dammit you're hungry. I mean, of course, patronizing fast food ""restaurants"". This book reveals the insidious evil you walk away from the counter with on that brown plastic tray or from the pick-up window in the big paper bag. Well written, well researched, thoroughly convincing, if reading this book doesn't make you swear off fast food for good, nothing will. The fast food fat cats should be shaking in their shoes!"
3,A compelling argument for eating at home,"Do you realize that you probably eat out 30-50% of the week, and probably most of that is fast food? Eric Schlosser is a good writer. I found myself gobbling this up (pun intended) in a matter of days. What I read lingered for years. I found myself thinking about the true cost of fast food. The cumulative cost may surprise you.I am not entirely convinced that Eric isn't biased, after all, aren't we all? But he does seem a little more balanced than sensational documentary writers like Michael Moore. I enjoyed that Eric gives you the history all the way back to the first culprit ... the highway.It is a good read and it changed my eating for a short time. Alas, only a short time since choices are limited when you travel for a living. The good news is that a lot of fast food choices have changed from when this book was released."
4,Every high school student should read,"This book is very informative and should be required reading for every High School student. I live in Colorado Springs where many of the author's examples are drawn. His attention to detail is notable.Unfortuantely, the author uses his platform to attack and blame the Republican Party just about all of America's woes. If you can take his comments with a grain of salt, it is still worthy reading."
5,Eric Schlosser is a hero!,"People need to be writing more books like Fast Food Nation!This is one of the best books I've read in a long time! Whether or not you care about what you eat - it is so interesting. You will have a greater respect for so many people after reading this. I thought I knew what I would be reading when I bought this book but it is so much more. Eric Schlosser writes in an ""every man"" style that you will completely identify with. It's also shockingly in depth, supported by pages and pages of notes.I'm sure you will be surprised at how defined North Americans are by Fast Food. It's not just about the food - it's the people, the industry, the culture. It's almost ridiculous how its all connected!Go out and buy this now! It will amaze you! You will thank yourself for giving it a chance. Also, don't miss his next book Reefer Madness."
4,Good read for students,"Much has already been written about this book, but I just want to add how interested my high school students were when I read aloud parts of it in class (one of them actually went out and bought their own copy.) Of course they were interested because they could relate to the topic of fast food, but at the same time this book provided a critical analysis of an industy that most of my students take for granted as being as American as apple pie. I found that reading them parts of this book helped me to further show how investigating a topic can often lead to better critical analysis and insight than what they get from televised news and commercials, the latter of which I wish Schlosser had explored in his work--how advertising helps to make fastfood so accetable in this culture.I look forward to this work coming out in paperback so that it might be puchased for classroom libraries."
5,Holy Hamburger!,"To make it succinct...we haven't eaten in a fast food restaurant for over 30 years and are sure glad of it! Schlosser gives you everything about fast food and the founders in this book, he's a superb researcher. The book is a fast read, but for data purposes, he's included an index! How wonderful!The information on Walt Disney and the post war Nazis he hired didn't surprise me, but what did is the meat packing industry. He also had a separate article regarding same in Mother Jones Magazine. I'd always wondered why there had been a plethora of ecoli problems in recent years when prior to the last couple decades, meat seldom had problems. Schlosser tells you why.It's a great piece of work...I can't wait for his book on prisons."
5,The Lowdown,"We all hear about how fast food is ""bad"" for you and all that, but never much about the process behind it. This books gives a well documented and detailed account on how the industry started and the factors around it that transformed this industry into the beast that it is today. From the potatoes, to the beef and those that are exploited to produce the food that so commonly eaten by all, Schlosser delivers a great book loaded with insight into fast food and its influence on society - not just in America, but globally. A definite must read if you have ever had a french fry."
2,Issue deserves a real analysis,"I can't claim to have finished this book. In truth, I read about the first 70 pages before putting it down in disgust. I'm a vegetarian and am concerned about the effect of fast food on our society. Unfortunately, Schlosser lost me around the time he began ranting about the problem with Colorado Springs being the fact that all the Republicans from California moved there, or the attack on the ""free enterprise"" values espoused in an area that owes its prosperity to military spending. What's the point of an investigation when you've obviously determined the conclusion ahead of the research? Useful material for angry students or the chattering classes' dinner parties, compromised dogma for those seeking a real analysis of the industry's effect on society. Anyone have any recommendations for those of us that prefer not to have our conclusions drawn for us?"
1,I've seen feces that was more interesting,"Want a big surprise? There is somebody in a slaughterhouse who kills animals!! Ohh noo! And corporations do evil things to small farmers! Amazing isn't it? And our food has artificial flavor in it? Really? No kidding!!!I thought this book would be something worth reading, but it was just a bunch of common sense recycled ...[junk] meant to feed the eager minds of budding intellectuals. Save your money and buy some burgers instead."
3,That was grows,This book was a good book it showed how the fast food industry started and how they target yonger children. Schlosser uncovers the food industry and all its secreats and tactics they use to bring people to there restaurants.
4,a wonderful document of the food of a nation,"Do not be put off by the book's silly subtitle, (the dark side...) This book is much more than sensationalism. It is very much an engrossing document of how striving entrepreneurs, most of them high-school drop-outs, created a billion dollar industy that markets everything that can possible be marketed-food, toys, child-care, globalisation, and so on. It does not try to criticise the industry too much and instead takes a very objective stand, hoping only for fairness to employees and otherwise documenting the rise of fast-food in general. Engrossing and insightful."
4,Fast- Food: Gone with it!,"I really enjoyed reading Schlosser's Fast- Food Nation. He really explained and elaborated the history and evolution of the industry, with pro's and con's. As well as focusing on the history of the fast- food industry, he connects with Upton Sinclair's, ""The Jungle,"" talking about the meat- packing industry and how it effects the fast food industry today. Personally, I don't eat fast- food but it was very interesting to read about how it got started and how today, it's gotten to the point that there is a McDonald's in almost every state in the U.S. as well as in Europe.Overall, I rate this book 4 stars and look forward to read more of Schlosser's books in the future."
5,"A well written, well researched expose on American culture","This book goes well beyond the superficial complaints and jokes about fast food and the fast food industry and explores with rich detail, on-the-site observations and a compelling narritive the rise of fast food in the last 30 years and its impact on America and our culture. Our country has been transformed by this industry, the book thoroughly explains, and we look behind the counter as to what all of this means. it is a book about our culture and politics in as much as the nutrition of what we eat."
2,"I felt like I was reading a text book, very overrated.","I heard such great things about this book but was very disappointed upon reading it. I kept waiting and waiting for it to get interesting, but it never seemed to do so. I thought it would go into more detail about processing and ingredients and less about socio-economics and politics. Too each is own I suppose. A lot of people really seemed to love this book, but I just didn't see what all the fuss was about."
1,"Despite all the hype, a big disappointment","I originally purchased this book because of the interesting topic and the glowing reviews on amazon. Upon reading this book, I was extremely disappointed by the contents.I expected a higher level of reading - this book can be read by those of an eighth grade education; fifth grade even. It relies on too many anecedotes and information that's already passed around by animal rights activists, urban myths, and health conscious people.What's positive about this book is that it makes you actively conscious of the contents of processed foods - and that's always a plus. If you're going to buy it, wait until it comes out in paperback."
1,Schlosser is not an expert on agriculture,Avoid this book at all costs and engage in reading sources written by experts in the field of agriculture.
3,Fast Food Nation,"""Fast Food Nation"" should have been a home run. Nevertheless, due to some sloppy editting, and the author's tendency for soap-box pontification the book is merely good when it could have been excellent. [In the epilogue the author recounts some of the great achievements of the U.S., listing the minimum wage as one of them. While the minimum wage may be good public policy (which it may or may not be), to consider it a ""great achievement"" is laughable.] This is a story needs telling, and the author does an excellent job of laying out the ""ripple effect"" the Fast food industry has on all of Agri-Business, as well as the associated job markets. But he fails to go the next step and project what the reaction among consumers would be if his recommendations were enacted. An assertive editor may have been better at keeping the author on message."
5,Not getting it,"Schlosser reveals far more than the other reviewers have given him credit for. This book isn't about never eating fast food again, although that could be your conclusion. This book is about giving up what you have for something less. He opens with the picture of San Bernadino's orange groves and shows us that most of what America's excess destroys is that which can never again be regained. From Peter Lowe's pep rallies to the iron fisted greed of corporations this is the modern day How Much Land Does a Man Need?"
5,I will rethink ever going to a McDonalds again.,This book layed everything on the table when it comes to the fast food industry. This is a no-holds book about this growing American industry. I think that anyone who plans to eat at a fast food restaurant should read this book. A MUST READ!!
5,Top-notch Journalism,"The author brings a high level of professionalism to his story about the growth of the fast food industry and the consequences of its ruthless pursuit of profits.And judging by the updates added for the paperback version, it's been a powerful force for legal reform. Not surprising given the thoroughness of the author's research.One gripe: the tone is overly self-righteous. You cannot entirely blame the industry for the consequences of an unhealthy fast food diet. Some of that burden rests on the shoulders of its customers."
5,TRUTHFUL AND SAD----!!!!!!,"For sure it should be federally mandated that the meat packing industry clean up it's act~!!!! What are they waiting for~??!!! How much greed is going to make a difference~??!!!!! If you keep hurting or even killing your customers, eventually people will not buy these fast food products~!!!! Time to act~!!!!"
1,Droning on and on,"The author drones on and on. He belabors every set of ""facts"" he uses to attack the fast food industry. I worked at a fast food restaurant as a teenager. Yes, it was mindless work. But we had fun and made the most of it. We were well managed and always treated very fairly.He certainly could sum up his one sided opinions in a more concise manner."
1,"This book was a joke, right??","Facts were incorrect on several occasions. Very one sided view of a business. He really hates republicans, and that is ok, but this book should be moved to the opinion cat...not non fiction...most of the book just isn't true."
1,Ugh,"Even though I'm not a fast food fan and certainly see some interesting/helpful research presented here, I still think this book is a horrible collection of polemic. Most of the good in this book is already known intuitively by your average reader. And most of the bad, is, really bad. He has a political agenda and attempts to put the worst spin on everything, so much so that even things like efficiency and a desire to reduce margins of error is portrayed as insidious.The sum of Eric's argument: Fast food companies are efficient, successful, rich, hire low income workers, don't train them enough, and are not altruistic, and therefore evil. Probably not worth reading unless you think McDonalds is the forte of gourmet food and really healthy for you."
2,A Man With an Axe to Grind.,"I guess I see where this was supposed to be going, but I think we get lost someplace.The historic and business stuff is interesting, but the belabored meat packing stuff fails to strike me as fast food-specific...I mean, wouldn't Americans eat meat even if there wasn't a McDonalds?The premise is great, but the book gets sidetracked too often.Much of it is truly fascinating...but the association to the core topic of fast food is weak at best."
4,Things that make you go hmmmmmmm........,"I bought this for a long flight; it was hard to put down so I didn't. That is why I get my own personal light, right? From Walt at Disney to Ronald (Mc D's) a complete look at the influence of fast food over society and especially our children. This was some of the best research and a very interesting part of American History. ""Who knew?""A definite must read if you have ever been in, around or seen fast food."
3,Interesting Read but Dozens of Spelling and Grammatical Errors,I enjoyed the content of the book. I am writing this review to point out the dozens of glaring spelling and grammatical errors throughout this book. For the cost of books these days I think publishers owe us the courtesy of having someone read the book at least once before selling it to the public. The spelling errors were glaring and detracted from the story. The errors are especially frustrating because this is the second edition of this book that has been released!
5,"Great book, and there is even more to consider...","This is a very important book. The powerful corporate food industry hates it, as you can see from some of the comments here and from attacks in the media by various industry flacks, lobbyists and think tanks. But the food safety crisis is rife with rancid scandal and even worse than this book reveals. Fast Food Nation doesn't touch much on mad cow disease, for instance. For that story check out the books Mad Cow USA or Deadly Feasts. And support your local sustainable organic farmers."
4,Fast Food World,"... <BR...""Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal"" is not just about fast food. It is about the culture of fast food. Fast food is an increasingly important part of the economy and, indeed, an important part of our culture. The look on the ""dark side"" of the fast food industry is not what is on most minds as we habitually drive towards the Golden Arches.... The style of food preparation as discovered in this book was not at all surprising for me. ......BR>Competition is another way of life Schlosser tries to explain in the book. ...Schlosser makes a good stand, showing just how fast food restaurants vie for our business. ...BR>This book is more for the uninformed consumer. One who is oblivious to the ""real"" world."
2,Overrated,"I felt this book is overrated. While a good indictment of the fast food industry, the book was more interested in the plight of the average fast food worker than it was in how the food actually gets processed. I was expecting more information on the processing tactics of the various companies and was extremely disappointed."
3,An eye opener -,"This was not a ""fun"" read but is important information that the public should be aware of. I am not an uninformed individual but have to say I learned a lot from reading this. My disappointment is that nothing much has changed since this was written. Fast Food Nation was a local book club selection and the discussion should be interesting."
5,changing agriculture industry,"I knew that the food was bad - no suprise since it also made me sick when I ate it. Now I have more reason to avoid supporting fast food. The change to the meat and agriculture industry is astounding. Harsher, deadlier chemicals are used so that the industry can have the same big potatoes to make french fries. And I thought this was the one safe food I could eat. This book is an eye opener."
2,Disappointing focus,"Perhaps I misinterpreted the review I read of this work. I was expecting Schlosser to examine fast food restaurants and use their business properties, health qualities, expansion patterns, etc. as a springboard to examine and explain the American psyche. This he did in the introduction and somewhat consistently in part I, although his histories of Carl's and McDonald's drifted a bit too long. But in the more lengthy part II the book went into the same old story of: American farmers and ranchers and blue-collar workers have lost their power, lost their independence, have been turned into efficiency machines by big business. And this is spreading like some terrible disease throughout the world.Schlosser's points are valid but they're not the reason I picked up the volume, so it became a bit of a skim-a-thon. Oh well."
1,Snorefest.,... I am honestly flabberghasted this book has such a high rating. I had to read it for a school seminar class and I was only able to read the first half. Even that was a struggle. But I had to stop after that. I just couldn't take the drone any longer. A large portion of my classmates didn't read it and the ones that did skipped the first half and just read the second half which was apparently more interesting. But whatever; I don't even care. This book is not worth money or reading time.
2,sucks,"I was interested in reading this book, thinking to myself that, yes i am going to finally stop eating out. But yes i was very much so wrong. It had nothing to do with the Fast Food Nation, Mcdonalds is still a choose of mine when it comes to eating out. The book talked alot about what goes on in a slaughterhouse and the conditions of them. So i very strongly do not recommand this book."
2,Boring! Too Long! Too drawn out.,Unless you're some nerd rocket scientist save your money. Book is totally boring. Only 10% of the book is worth reading. It does'nt get right to the point. Totally boring chapters about founders of McDonalds. Even goes back to cowboy days. I just wanted to hear the dirt-- you know the juicy details. You'll find yourself skipping whole chapters. Talks about dumb laws related to the meat... I love reading but this book is just too difficult and BORING. 383 Pages.
3,A little too skewed,"Book starts out pretty even-handed and then becomes nothing but extremely skewed liberal ranting. For example, lots of whining about the difficulties of ranches because of suburban inroads but nothing about the small fortunes they've made selling their land to developers. Another example is how he goes on and on about the lack of unions, where 1/3rd of the workers are actually unionized (including the guys at the start of the butchery line). Everything bad in the world is blamed on Republicans. Still, there's some good information in here if you're not familiar with the topic, and the writing is good."
4,A great help,Gordon McComb gives a fantastic explanation on the workings of speakers that will make one feel like a pro once finished reading the book. Great for people wanting to make thier own speakers or just wanting to become more knowledgable. The terms used are not too technical but in depth enough to give a 'sound' understanding (excuse the pun). Well done Gordon.
5,Warlock: The Armageddon,"Every six hundred years, a great evil has the opportunity to escape and unleash Armageddon. A group of five stones has the power to either free the evil, or banish it for another six hundred years. An order of Druids battles with a Warlock determined to unleash his father upon the world."
4,Wacky Magic Fun,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's goofy and the Druids vs. the Warlock history is a bit silly but overall quite enjoyable. It has better pacing than the first film and seems less disjointed even though the Warlock's search for the runestones is told in a series of little vignette's. Some of the ""druid training"" scenes are quite beautiful with very creative direction to attain subtle effects which nicely contrast the Warlock's macabre magic.As I said before the story is a little silly but I liked it better than the witch-hunter sent through time story of the first film and the forgettable kids in a haunted house approach of the third."
4,a quick and dirty bible for pedi dysphagia,Love this text. I use it all the time in my work with children who have dysphagia. IT's a great resource for me and a tool to help educate parents and caregivers.
3,I tried,I don't have much of a review because I bought this case hoping it would fit my psp-1001 and it didn't. I was buying it to try and prevent damage from my 4 and 6 year olds.
4,Doesn't fit if your PSP has the extended battery.,"I bought this in a rush and didn't think about the fact that it may not work with the extensded battery on the PSP. So, while it's a decent product for most people, I am completely unable to use it."
2,Wrong one. Does not fit.,The item was in perfect NEW condition but it was not for the older PSP. It was for the newer slimmer model. Nowhere on the item description did it say that it was for the newer model. It was inexpensive so it is not worth spending the money to send it back.
3,"Excellent movie, awful DVD","THE MUPPET MOVIE is a classic. It is enjoyable by all ages. Sony Columbia's DVD release of THE MUPPET MOVIE does it little justice. On the plus side, a widescreen version of the film is offered, so the entire picture can be seen.But, the bad things: This DVD has only one extra, a camera test. This is actually very entertaining, and a worthy special feature. Some Muppetisms and trailers are included, but they are not any good.There is so much that could have been done for this DVD release. The picture quality is awful, scratches, dirt and grain are everywhere.Where is the original theatrical trailer? Where is the TV special that promoted the film, ""THE MUPPETS GO HOLLYWOOD""? Where are the audio commentary and interviews? If Columbia decides to re-release a Special Edition, I will be first in line."
5,Make Way for Muppets,"This is a classic film to any child who is a child of the Muppets. Jim Henson took something that was already great and decided to make it even better. Giving people a look at how the Muppets all actually met, Henson provided the much needed background for people to truly love these furry little people/animals/and Gonzos that much more. Plus, who could not love this movie for the shear fact that it opens with one of the greatest songs ever...""The Rainbow Connection."" It has that childlike innocence that allows children to love it, however, having watched this movie so many times in my life, I find that even as an adult I find jokes I missed as a child. Every child should be forced to watch this movie to find out what it means to have friends who care about you..."
5,LONG LIVE THE MUPPETS,"I dont know how to put it other than this. The muppets make me happy. Extremely so. They make me laugh, they make me smile. But they make me happy. This movie is perfect. I love it. It changed my life. Give it a chance dont dismiss it because its puppets or a family film or anything. Watch it. Love it. It is one of the best things that can happen to you."
5,Fantastic!!!!,"I saw this movie in the theatres when I was 6 years old. I'm 26 now, and am buying it for the children I hope to have. The movie is terrific. I still shed a tear when watching the spectacular ending."
5,How can you miss...,"If you love the muppets - especially the old muppet TV series, then you will love this movie. Jim Henson put a lot of love into this movie and it shows - again and again. I first saw the movie when it came to the theater and I can still sing the ""Rainbow Connection"" (a song sung by Kermit in the opening) by heart. It is rare that a song hits the heart with that much emotion and pure realism, but this song and ""It's not easy being Green"" (not in the movie but a Kermit fav.) are them. Get this movie - if you are a kid or adult. I am 30+ and still watch it at least once every couple months just for my own enjoyment and reminder that there is ""love, kindness and innocence"" in the world."
2,1 star for the DVD 5 stars for the film,"OK I love this movie but I am getting really sick of studios releasing films with no extras on DVD. Muppets in Space has more features than this far superior Muppet film. How sad..I have NO intention spending money on a DVD that has no extra features...I'm getting tired of 6 months later a special edition being released with extras after I bought the first. (Dogma, Shakepeare in Love and others all did this!"
2,For Older OS Computers,"As with so many other older programs, this one does not fully work with Vista. The most annoying aspect was that I bought this program specifically to do transparent backgrounds, a feature that doesn't work with Vista. Other than that, it seemed like a nice program, and I would have loved it if I still used XP."
5,I'm a convert,"I've also experienced positive results using MMO as a gas treatment. I formerly used various gas treatments like Gumout, STP, etc. and hoped they were doing something beneficial. I tried MMO at a high dosage in an old rough running push mower, and while it smoked some, it ran noticeably smoother. Now I'm using MMO in all my small engine gas, 2 & 4 cycle.Next I added it to the gas of my rough idling '96 Dodge Ram 5.2L and guess what, same results, noticeably smoother idle and quieter acceleration. I'm sure my neighbors are happy because it used to sound like a tugboat chugging along out in the driveway and a Harley taking off down the road.MMO works and is a better value since it takes less to treat a tank of gas. I'm occassionally using it in my '07 Toyota FJ Cruiser as a preventative treatment.I never thought I'd be so convinced but I'll keep using it until they change it or jack the price too much!"
3,timyz toyz,it is a purple mix runs a little better increases the horse power just a little pretty big bottle doesnt smell like gas
5,"My pillow crunches, does yours? :)","I've never had a buckwheat pillow before, but heard that they were great for your neck. I can tell you that between sleeping on one or two regular pillows for all my life and having one night's rest on the buckwheat pillow, the latter wins hands down. It's comfortable and I can form it to fit my body however I need it to. After sleeping on it, my neck feels so much better and my spine feels less constricted! It's a bit hard against my head but I will get used to it as I did when I began sleeping on the floor asian-style. It's worth it, and it's the perfect size. Also, it has an awesome, natural scent that is both new and comforting! Love it. Would buy from this seller again!"
4,great for my neck issues!!!,"I love this pillow, it takes a few days to get used to it but it has completely turned my post neck sleeping discomforts around. Thanks to buckwheat..."
3,Think carefully first,"I bought the ""regular"" size pillow, and didn't notice that this is considerably smaller than the ""standard"" American pillow--which means that on a double bed, this pillow doesn't fit with the other pillow, and a standard pillowcase doesn't fit it. Had I realized this, I would have ordered the travel size pillow, which is cheaper, would have been fine for my needs, and would have been easier to store when not in use. Because a standard pillow case does not fit this pillow, I also had to buy a cover from this company, which brought the price up.NEW NOTE: Now, a couple years later, the buckwheat hulls have degraded, turning almost to powder. They provide less bulk (flatter pillow); and they have begun leaking through the cover. As they are dark brown, this causes a bit of a mess. The pillow cover is turning brown. To continue using this pillow, I would have to start all over with new buckwheat hulls, but I think I'll pass."
5,"Totally worth it, but kinda small...",I have had neck problems for as long as I can remember. I have tried all kinds of gimmicky pillows and still had neck pain in the morning. So I decided to give this a try and it works very well at supporting my nead and neck. I absolutely love it. The ONLY problem i have is that I should have gotten a bigger one... The japanese size is pretty small. It is even smaller than the advertised measurements. So take my advice and get at least the standard size. I know I am gonna upgrade. Hope this helps.
3,good,"it looks good on my bookshelf. Not sure if I have even used it for cooking, but it's there if needed."
4,this is perhaps the simplest and thinnest one,"you could ever get. only 112 pages. the interpretations are pretty right on the button or, right on the mark. some of the explanations are pretty vague, could be explained to either way, depends how you want to accept it. there's a big mistake on page 17, those two chinese characters were printed wrong, the right should be on the left, the left should be on the right. but it's no big deal, since most of the readers would not comprehend that language."
5,my favorites,"have watched this series over and over since it first came out, after reading all the books. Now it's nice to know I can e Atchison it any time I want."
1,lame self promoting garbage,"Imagine, if you will, that a little fat kid escaped from a star trek convention and decided to lecture about fighting.Like many people who feel weak and scared, MacYoung (you just know he gave himself the pathetic moniker ""animal"") is obsessed with stories of fighting and weapons. He's the sort that , in a bar, tells you that he's really working for the CIA.yes, he's right that most martial arts aren't street ready or effective--but I don't think you'll solve that problem with his books.Read Geoff Thompson instead."
1,(Razor) Burned,"The delivery of this item was very impressive, thanks for that, however the product is poor quality. The razor is dull. I'll need to send it in somewhere to be professionally sharpened and see if that improves the item."
4,A Sheepish Review,"In this collection of short stories, John ""Verm"" Sherman has pulled together some of his stories from his published columns in Climbing magazine. Although the three or four travelogues dragged a bit, the majority of stories are amusing and, in some cases, really funny. For example, how can the theory of relativity be observed/proved by a man and woman? (Sorry for the tease -- you'll have to read the book to get the answer to this question.) Putting wooly ovine conspiracy theories at front and center of the evidence, the book certainly offers some evidence to the notion that boulderers are more at the flaky edge of the climbing world. Very enjoyable read."
1,fairly awful,"The basic story with this film is that it was underwritten and countenanced by the Iranian government, but when it came time to take a look at what the director had wrought, the officials blanched, and to this day the film has only been shown in Tehran in a extensively butchered edition. But it has been shown there; hence the ""Banned in Iran"" brag on the cover is only partially true.Well, on the one hand, it does offer a look at something few Westerners could even imagine: what day-to-day life is like in an Iranian women's prison. Come on: how many of you could imagine what the inside of one looked like?Yet the film is stiff and boring. The direction is heavy-handed and inept, the story uninteresting, and the characters, only sketchily developed. On the whole, when you finish the movie, you'll probably wish you had stopped it 10 minutes in. Everything after that doesn't add much."
1,Such a rob,"Hi,This book is nothing but a rob, I thought may be this was done by his kid. This is the kind of art that brings the debate ""Does modern art allow everything?"""
4,Bought this stroller for our 3 yo,"Very sturdy and well-made, yet lightweight. Pushes more easily than typical umbrella stroller. My only complaint is that the handles could be a bit longer and/or adjustable. My husband is tall and the handles are a bit short for him."
1,Unhappy,After hooking up the TV to cable was disappointed with picture quality even after adjusting it with the contols on the side of the screen.The radio does not work. But that was not the reason I purchased a TV.Over all I am unhappy with it and will not use it.
3,"Pretty good, but expecting more","Being a huge Blindside fan, I was have high hopes for their first DVD release. I was hoping that it would show more of the band memebers goofing off, then people just interviewing them and little previews of them on tour.I love how they have all of their videos, especially the awesome ""Pitifu"" video and ""King of the Closet"". I also love the cornerstone show, since I happened to be there :)All-In-all, If you think you must get this DVD then go ahead, especially if your that die-hard blindside like me. The videos and the show at Cornerstone are a huge plus."
5,a doalble technique,"This is the best book I have ever read on stock investing. I have probably read 25 books. It is the best because it is applicable. Many books will tell you to buy what you know, to buy companies with sustainable competitive advantages, to buy companies with better Management etc. However, it is impossible for the average person to find this out, unless they spend hours reading the 10k's. This book gives you techniques that the average person can use."
5,Love this book!,"We recently built a home with a large front porch and I found many ideas in this book for making it look and feel cozy, for our family and those who come here. It is true as the author states that first appearances make lasting impressions. I keep my copy of this book on a table on our front porch near our wicker chairs so guests can enjoy it too. I have also given it as gifts. I totally disagree with the reviewer who called this book a lot of fluff! It's loaded with ideas, charm and tradition."
5,A Must Read!,"I never knew how to use a sport I love to help me develop better relationships with colleagues and business associates. The book's stories and tips really helped me to recognize when it was appropriate to turn a friendly round of golf into a business meeting, and when it wasn't. A must-read for any golfer!"
4,Proverbial Pinocio gets his Wish,"This is a wonderful addition to any Trekkers library. When an away team is sent to a planet to investigate rumors of an all powerful God, it is up to Commander Data to follow a local girl as she journeys to the ""Gods"", to have them grant a wish to help her family. Upon arrival, Data finds 2 things. First, that the rumors were correct. Second, that he, like the girl, will get his fondest wish...to become Human. He learns the meaning of the saying-""Be careful what you wish for, you might just get it"". A heart warming story, and extremely thought provoking, as well. Pick up your copy today"
4,Are you kidding me? this band reeks of greatness....,"wow this band has it all. The only thing i can think of, that i can dis is the vocalist. Hes good but he sounds a little young. For a first album though this band is right up there with dragonforce. The dual guitars are sickning for anyone and these guys have a lot of energy. One cool thing i like a lot if you really pay attention to the vocals, then you will know that they talk about a lot of current things going on in the world. Its not always about kings and dragons and battles this band is just a little differant. These guys are great and i cant wait to see what there next album is going to be like. If you like really fast riffs and powerfull speed metal then you need to go out and check these guys out. They sound like dragonforce dungeon kamelot and stratovarius all wraped up in one. These guys really are good im glad to see more and more bands bring back the metal scene."
3,The band itself is great...,"But the vocalist screws them over tremendously. I cant even believe they would think of putting a guy like Michael Gremio on vocals. He looks and sounds like a worse version of Ville Valo (and thats hard to do!). Well, maybe he is a little better than Ville but he still drags the band down.The rest of the guys are great at what they do. The sound they have is exactly how Power Metal should sound. However, the vocalist is the cause for my 3 star rating. This album would have been a 5, but he screwed them over. If this band wants to earn my attention and respect then they need to either have Michael change his vocal stylings or get someone good who sounds like Hansi Kürsch, Matthew Barlow, Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, or ZP Theart."
4,amazing,"amazing cd. the only thing that bothers me about it is the quality. (especially on forever unbound) when the band stops you can hear amp buzz/hiss and some drum stuff sounds like it was from a drum machine. its almost the sound of a demo, which was why i gave it 4 stars. otherwise, amazing cd"
3,Just when I was getting into it.,"I was jolted back to reality by a stupid factual error in this book.Plastic IV bags were not used until about 1970, so when the Lieutenant cut a slit into the IV bag and put the poison in I was instantly not thinking about the book, but rushing to the internet to see that glass IV bottles were used in 1944, also in the Korean War and Vietnam. Who edits this stuff anyway?"
2,I Tried Hard To Really Like This Book... But To No Avail!,"The WWII thriller is my favorite genre and the plot of The Second Objective seemed like it would be right up my alley; i.e., a special group of twenty German commandos who face almost certain death to achieve a ""second objective"" during a last ditch effort to defeat the western allies in late 1944. However, Mark Frost's unbelievable, one-dimensional main characters, coupled with the unrealistic, flawless American-style English dialogue they speak and their ability to have at their fingertips minute details of specific aspects of American life, took away the pleasure I was hoping to get from reading this book. Further, while the book has its share of murders, Frost describes them in a pretty actionless and unexciting manner. Obviously, I was highly disappointed in The Second Objective and do not recommend it to you."
1,Lame and Lackluster Effort,"Nice concept-nice effort. Put together an all-star ensemble of talented musicians and vocalists (Bobby Lyle, Maysa, George Benson, Vesta, et. al.) and you expect to get a masterpiece, right? Well, don't get your hopes up on this project folks. The music contained herein is poorly produced and the selection of songs are not that great by any stretch of the imagination. The only track on this disc that is half-way impressive is ""Don't Make Me Cry"" featuring Peabo Bryson on lead vocals. The rest of these songs are not interesting at all. It's disappointing that so many talented artists collaborated on such a lackluster project. Trust me - don't waste your time or money on this one."
5,Excellent Product!,"This steering wheel cover is great!Came brand new, new leather smell, went on easily, fits great, does not slip, looks very sporty, very durable leather, feels good in your hands, the grips with the NOS emblems, look excellent, and give you a good feeling of strong grip in your hands.HIGHLY recommend this product. It looks just as good (if not, better) in person, on your car.Do not hesitate to buy this item. I love it!"
3,African American Collector of Black dolls,"I rated the book as satisfactory, because I purchased Myra Perkins book on Black dolls several years ago, consequently I view this book as an up dated version of her book. I think the layout could have been much better and the paper quality used to print the book could have been better too."
2,Vegan cuisine is not macrobiotic cuisine,"This cookbook's well-organized menus and recipes specific to each of the 4 seasons in a temperate climate zone is very helpful, but the book's title is misleading. The word macrobiotic is used in the book title, however all of the book's recipes are vegan. A little history is recounted here: During the first decade of macrobiotics in the USA, all the macro cookbooks featured a moderate use of fish and fish products. Fish products played an especially important part of soup recipes, such as miso soup. The alteration of traditional macrobiotic recipes in this cookbook to excise fish means that the authentic macrobiotic diet is actually not being represented here, and the fact that this cookbook does not discuss that omission makes it even more out of balance with mainstream macrobiotic thinking."
3,Sub-Zero not as good.,"I absolutely LOVE Cat's Claw - the ORIGINAL one. However, Sub-Zero - the new product they are substituting for it - is not as effective. They say it is no different but they are wrong. The analgesic has been cut from 4.5% in the ORIGINAL to 3.9% in the Sub-Zero. And it does not work as well. My knees don't lie! I am so bummed. Just when I had finally found a product that really worked. PLEASE bring back the original formula. The name doesn't need to sound more like their competitor Bio-Freeze - the product speaks for itself!!!!!!!!"
4,May Make You Cry,"This memoir is so touching that you may shed tears. This book would be great turned into a movie. There are probably many teen girls out there who may feel similarly, but not sure where to turn. Overall, a must read and it's an easy read."
3,Very funny,"I found this vhs very funny. But I gave it a 3stars,because I'm a competative tennis player,who's seeking for tips at an average level. This vhs is for old people who just go to the court for fun. If you're playing tennis for fun than buy it and see how you can beat those old fellows everytime."
4,"Ghosts, Gouls and Gobblins, Oh My!","Living in New England and being close to Salem and the House of Seven Gables, a bit of the folklore rubs off and gets into your blood. Especially now, with all the TV shows about paranormal activities, it creates an interest in the afterlife. What better way to hand down these New England stories than by creating a book about them. God only knows if they are true or not, but regardless, they are short, entertaining stories- similar to what you'd tell kids at a camp fire. Actually, I work with a woman who swears that she once saw the man in red on the hiway leading to Cape Cod.If you want entertainment, this should do well. If you want a more serious approach to ghosts and the paranormal, this probably won't or shouldn't do the trick."
5,Some of the best music in modern movies,I have a copy of this movie and just watched it again. A great sequel to a great movie. John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band can really rock.
2,Timing is Everything,"The 1989 sequel to Eddie and the Cruisers (1983) finds Michael Paré and Matthew Laurance reprising their roles as Eddie Wilson and Sal Amato, respectively.But a tip-off on the quality of the production is the number of years that had gone by for the completion of this fictional account of a rocker's ""death,"" a record company that markets the mystery as much as repackaging old songs and an unexpected comeback to the national spotlight.The cliches - a record company that only eyes the bottom line and the tortured mind of an artist who strives to make music, without the hype - may borrow the fact & fiction from the (in)famous history of rock-n-roll, but muddles what had been a story that had mostly avoided such trappings.There was potential to elevate the script, with Eddie Wilson's life truly taking center stage, but it ultimately stalls before reaching a satisfying finish."
2,The JarJar Binks of a classic!,"As other have said, This is a ""last ditch effort by the movie producer to rake in some bucks on a classic"" If you have not wasted your money on this, Don't Rent it, burn it, forget it!"
5,Eddie and the Cruisers 2 - Eddie Lives!,"What a great movie and soundtrack. The Beaver Brown Band, who recorded the soundtracks, did an outstanding job. Michael Pare played the role with tenacity. I would like to see both movies re-released as a set. Let's do it Amazon!"
4,Eddie Lives,"If You Like Movies With Music Its A Good Movie Better Than Part 1,I thought the sound Quality was Good at Best."
1,World Religions Today,Very Very CONFUSING READ!!! This book explains the world religions but in a very confusing way! It does a bad job of making things clear. The author skips around in the book. I didn't like this at all.
3,Thought-provoking.....,"The first time I saw this movie, I was a teenager and thought it was horrible. After re-watching it now, in my 30s, I think the movie has merit, although the scene involving the girl and the trucks is one of the most sickening I've ever seen. Some of the violence was overkill, in my opinion. One of the things I like about ""The Hitcher"" is that it makes one think. Is the villain non-existent as a person, and a mere illustration of the ""evil"" part of the Howell character's psyche? Or is he real? You decide!"
3,Not like wine,"I first saw this movie when HBO released it in the mid 80's. It was part of a ""Horror Movie Fest"" at my home and it was pretty creepy then. I haven't seen it since, but the release of the remake made me want to see it again before I watched the new version.It's amazing how something so unnerving 21 years ago could be so campy now. Needless to say, I'm afraid to watch the remake, since Rutger Hauer used to be my favorite bad guy, and Sean Bean is one of my current favorites.Maybe I'll watch this again in 10 years... during a comedy night right after ""Evil Dead."""
2,Logic takes a back seat ...,"I bought this on a whim, having heard good things about it.It starts off well with Rutger Hauer suitably understated and menacing. However, by the first half hour the movie gets lost in la-la land with ""The Hitcher"" apparently having the killing and survival power of Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator.On top of the body count he racks up while hitching on the freeway, he also manages to take out a bunch of cops at a backwater police station (all killed apparently in total silence while our hero is taking a nap in one of the cells).At this point, it took all of my energy not to switch the movie off in disgust. It's too ridiculous to be thrilling. This sort of thing has been done so much better in numerous other films. Steven Spielberg's Duel being one example. Even Breakdown with Kurt Russell was more convincing than this.Despite the occasional effective moment, my advice would be to give this one a big miss ..."
4,Non stop thrills!,This movie is really thrilling and follows such a great and original story. Keeps you gripped to the end. Great movie!
4,Very good B movie,"Rutger Hauer dominates this classy thriller, with a performance that matches his role in Bladerunner. Every twitch he makes is scary and from the start of the film you are left in no doubt that this guy is seriously deranged. Occasionally some of the other actors wern't quite up to the same standard, but in general this is a well acted film.Forget about plot and any sense that this could really happen. Think more of Halloween and translate Michael Myers as the Hitcher and you'll be closer. Its well photographed with some images that have almost become iconic.What surprised me about this film was the way characters that you might normally expect to survive (in a Hollywood film) did not in The Hitcher. So credit where credit is due, not only is this a short and punchy thriller, but it does the unexpected on more than one occasion."
5,The Best FRESHNER,I don't know why they discontinued this product. This stuff is the best and it can last for days. Febreze does not stack up against it. They need to bring it back!
4,Racism Goes Back,"This book taught: That fear of African people was around in the ancient world, the moors were leaders in Europe, African insecurity is dangerous for everyone, and more."
5,BOOK ORDER,tHIS BOOK WAS A LAST MINUTE REQUESTFOR AN ENGLISH CLASSRECIEVED IT SO FASTWILL DEFINITLY PURCHASE HERE AGAIN
3,Attention getter,Perfume is very personal. You must smell and wear for yourself to decide if it works for you. I liked the smell but just a little to overpowering for me. Kinda like a flower garden. My sister loves it.
5,OMG!!!!,This was such a great deal. Love it I get so many copliments on its smell and for the price couldn't go wrong. Every one at work know I love AMAZON Sherry
1,Obsession,The product did not meet my expectations. I feel that it may be an old batch or one rejected by quality control (or lack of quality control).
1,VERY DISSATISFIED!!!!!!!,"This perfume came damaged. The bottle had leaked into the packaging and the whole package reeked of Obsession. The bottle was only 3/4 full because of the leakage, and it was not returnable because apparently returning perfume, even within a few days and with damage, isn't permissible. This was supposed to be a Christmas gift. I will never buy perfume from Amazon again."
1,Fake Perfume on Amazon - I got cheated,"Before purchasing this product, I had read reviews that fake perfumes are being sold on Amazon. But, keeping in mind my 6 year order history, I ignored it and now I am paying the price for it.The CK Obesssion for Women that I bought turned out to be COMPLETE FAKE. There was no fragrance at all. When we sprayed it, we were shocked to realize that the product didn't have any fragrance at all. It was like spraying water. I don't think CK would have made such a bad product.Alas, I don't have an option to return this product and I don't know if there is a mechanism to lodge a formal complaint with Amazon."
5,finally great perfume!,"opened the box and it was truley obsession by calvin klein, this smells so good and my hubby raised his eyebrows and said yeah babby that one smells good! I like it too!"
5,Insurance Commander,"I've been in business over 20 years. I purchased book just to add to my library, but it was a great refresher course, a reminder of things I forgot, and in these latest economic turmoil, I am resurecting things I used to do when I started the business. If your new in business it is a must. If you been in business and need to refocus, this is your book."
1,Disappointing,"First let me state that I feel this Star Trek story is almost an affront to the Star Trek universe.I was about to write a critique of the story after reading it but then decided to check on Amazon to compare what other readers of this book had to say. My impressions were valid.This is one of the worst Star Trek stories I have ever read. My congratulations to; ""A. Customer"", ""Shawn Weaver"", and ""jrmspnc"" for extremely accurate and pertinent reviews. I recommend anyone interested in reading this book read their reviews first before they buy.I mean no disrespect to the authors, Sondra Marshak and Myrna Culbreath, but perhaps they should forgo future collaboration."
1,Terrible,I have read a lot of Star Trek novels and this one is really sadly written. I'm just thankful they only wrote 4 star trek novels.
1,Not a very good book!,This book is very much out of the ST universe. Not very well written and plotted.Not a good read!
3,"Light, but flimsy","The best thing about this stroller is the weight. It's really light. That leads to other problems, though; like, it's fairly flimsy. My eight-month old can pull the entire seat forward when he's strapped in, just by sitting up. The storage basket underneath, like many other reviews have mentioned, holds very little, is almost inaccessible if a child is in the stroller, and has a bar running through the middle of it anyway. The wheels also have a lot of trouble tracking, especially inside stores where the surface is smoother. If you're tall, you'll kick the wheels when walking.We bought it because it was cheap and light, but we're having to spend more money now to upgrade because it just doesn't do the job. If you use your stroller a lot, buy a better one."
2,looks cheap...but only $20,"I bought 3 of these as gifts... it looks and feel cheap, the battery was low for all 3... couldn't even use the indigo light."
4,Wife loves it!,"My wife normally has trouble sleeping, but sleeps like a baby after showering with this before bed. She absolutely loves it! The product has a very soothing scent to it. (Would be 5 stars if it were priced a bit better.)"
5,"Fast paced, hard hitting action/adventure...engrossing!","The person who likes fast-paced, hard-hitting action and adventure will not be able to put this book, or any of Axler's Deathlands series down. I have read all but a couple of the very early titles, as well as his Earthblood trilogy and am on the second of his Outlander's series...all great and published about every other month.Highly recommended for those who enjoy getting lost in a good yarn with vivid writing, and no slow down, that leaves you turning pages well past your bedtime...much to my chargin many mornings.Essentially ""blood, guts and gore"" in nature with a good story line that follows the trials of a small group of ""survivors"" in a series of stories set a hundred years in the future following a nuclear holocaust. Basic survivalism with instinct, common sense, and preholocaust weapons to keep you alive. I challenge anyone to just try and put one of Axler's novels down"
3,Likeable if you don't look too deep,"I liked this movie, even though it is chocked full of plot holes. The movie is heavy in creepy paranoia atmosphere, and is successful in that area. But when it comes to story, it falters a little.For example, they are 80 miles away from anything....but later in the movie two characters decide to roller blade back to a town.The van picks up two people who wreck their car and drive for several hours, but later, when the two roller bladers decide to go back to the 80 mile away town, they arrive at the wrecked car in minutes.In a scene close to the beginning, you can see a girl standing in a field watching the group. There is no further explanation. The scene is very creepy, but nothing ever comes of it."
1,Thought it was bigger. Child not interested in it at all,"This ball is about the size of a baseball and made of wood. It didn't interest my grandson. At $10, I expected more out of it."
4,FUN but...,It is very nice toy and really fun to look at it and play with it.Just it doesn't keep my son's attention for very long (maybe 1 minute at most).
3,nice but not fascinating,"this is a well-made, nice toy, but doesn't seem to hold my 12 month old grandson's interest for more than a moment. he does bat it with his hand so it rolls around on the floor, though, sometimes."
4,Cute and interesting,"Great little toy, it is smaller than I imagined. Being a natural wood toy, it can get scuffed up easily."
3,Smaller Than Expected but Still Acceptable,"My baby loves this toy. She likes to roll it out and watch the pegs pop out. It is made of durable, sturdy wood and won't break. My only complaint is that it is only about the size of a tennis ball. The picture on Amazon makes it look bigger than that. It's cute but I did think it should be cheaper considering the size of it."
3,peek a boo ball,"This is smaller then expected, only about 3"" diameter. Not that the smaller size is a bad thing. It makes it easier to store or travel with. It is a cool old school toy, but the pegs only come out with gravity or centrifical force. So it's only really fun to watch while it is rolling. My son hasn't played with it much, but I think it's fun. Maybe he'll get more into is as he gets a bit older. In the mean time I like that it makes very little noise and doesn't require batteries."
1,dangerous choking hazard. parents please do not buy.,"I bought this peek-a-boo ball for my then 5-month-old because I thought it was cute and it would be fun for my daughter to manipulate and roll around. We had played with it less than 5 times when one of the circular wooden pieces just fell off along with the little head!Attached is a picture. I am so thankful that my 5-year-old noticed it and brought it to me. My baby would have definitely put this in her mouth and choked on it. :( I will definitely be contacting Wonderworld about this product. They really should take toy off of the market. Parents, please do not buy this toy."
2,"The Silver Surfer works better in comics, not in prouse","The Silver Surfer works better as a visual character that you can see in a comic book story board, it's very hard to capture the Surfer's sense of cosmic wonder in prouse form, and so with many of these stories you have to really use your imagination to get a taste of what the Surfer is all about. Most Marvel heroes translate very well from comics to novel writing, but the Surfer does not quite make the mark."
5,"Projections - ""Beetween here and now""","I love Projections! Their album ""Between here and now"" is awesome, and its complete with two of the strongest tracks of the album. ""Backbone repirise"" really rocks with its strong flute hook and all the organic atmosphere, but my personal favorit is ""Escaping Sao paul"". A very strong groove, and that super hooky vocal sample, WOW!!! The album also contians some more funky music with tracks like, ""Innercity sides"" with its strong flavor of 70s soul vocals and ""Stillness meets me"" which is a timeless funk classic trip. Heavey material, lookin forward to there next move.....keep it up Projections!"
3,Projections only a faint glimmer,"Backbone is the perky money track (two versions of it). Nutcracker, Half Pint and Dangerous Blues also mildly interesting but the other tracks unremarkable."
1,A worthless book,"This book is a waste of money. The best hitters are determined by a nonsensical formula which just adds unrelated statistics up. Then each player gets a short biography and a picture or two. It's neither a coffee table book nor a book to read, so I can't imagine anyone who would be satisfied with this volume."
4,Awesome color,"The color is vibrant although perhaps slightly darker than the picture, it is definitely fuschia. It's not very soft, but a good add to a boring outfit in the fall season."
4,Neat little Hitchcock!,"I call this a ""little Hitchcock"" because it is a lesser known and short film directed by the Master. I have seen the majority of Hitchcocks films and consider myself a fan, yet I had never seen this one until two days ago. I was very pleasantly surprised.Montgomery Clift is perfectly cast in the role of a priest caught between a rock and a hard place. The turmoil in his role was played perfectly by him. This priest had been the receiver of a murder confession, and now he is haunted with the knowledge yet unable to do anything about it in his loyalty to his priestly vows.The complications to the story are feasible and suspenseful, and the resolution works out logically. I was very pleased with this film as a refreshingly ""different yet same"" film from the best suspense director of all time.Play close attention to the ironic last line muttered to ""Father Logan."""
1,was good while it worked,It worked well until it decided to stop working. Got it in December and it quit working about a month later.
4,"Love the little ""bullet""",We really enjoy using our Medisana every single day. It's great because it doesn't drip or leak all over the nightstand. I also like how it's not noisy. It just throws out this fine mist. We had used several humidifiers before we got this one.Only problem: you need two in a large room. This is more of a personal humidifier. You can't use it for the entire room. I am thinking of purchasing more because I can't get enough of this little bullet which packs a punch.
1,Junk product.,"This is one of the worst product I have ever bought. When I use this product, whole carpart around it gets wet. I stopped using this."
3,ultrasonic humidifier,I've used my Medisonic Ultrasonic Humidifier twice & have had no problems. It was quiet & puts out a sufficient amount of moisture. It's small & requires no filter. It's perfect for any room in our house & for travel. Amazon.com had the best price - by far!
4,Miss BOC? Buy THIS!,"While uneven as Blue Oyster Cult cds go, this is welcome & entertaining. I wish wish WISH these guys could get it together and put out 1 last killer record and do the tour of the year supporting it. Alas, that will probably never happen. SO go buy the new Blue Oyster Cult Columbia boxset, this cd, Joe Bouchard's Tales From The Island, Curse of the Hidden Mirror, and Heaven Forbid. All that and a case of beer is all you get to help assuage the pain of missing the Soft White Underbelly. You guys are SO missed!Peace~"
4,good solo cd,"I actually had the vinyl version of this back when. I later got rid of most of my vinyl and was glad to have this one on cd. However these sellers are just rotten, in alot of ways. Is there a market for a 135.00 cd? nope. it will sit there for decades and they will make no money from it. oh well. they don't care. And I have this one thankfully beecause it's a good solo effort from buck d. Of blue oyster cult fame. In fact some songs sound like boc and some are more poppy. But all in all it's a solid rock cd from the early 80's, which is a good time in the history of music actually. THere's no bonus tracks but at least this is on cd. or download. whatever, no seller is going to sell this over a hundred bucks. the sound is good on the cd as well."
4,Elementary My Dear Holmes Lover,"As so many have said before and I concur, Jeremy Brett is the definitive Holmes. It is really ashame he passed away recently. For years I was impressed with the black & white movies with Basil Rathbone. I never imagined he could be beat in his rendition of Holmes. Nigel Bruce indeed played a clod, and although somewhat amusing sometimes, I much prefer the newer version of Dr. Watson done by Burke and Hardwicke. I hope in the future that Granada or whoever produces these DVDs do a quality job. This production suffered sound and picture quality problems. I don't regret getting it because of Brett's and the other magnificent performances, but I'm very disappointed that such an excellent series was thought of so poorly by the DVD producers. It's a crime that Scotland Yard should make them pay dearly for."
2,A disappointment...,"Grainy transfer from 16 mm, bad sound on two of the four episodes, and an absolutely unviewable trailer really do ruin this DVD. I wanted this to be great, but with such obviously bad source material, and no attempt to clean it up, you can't expect much.This is no way to treat such a beloved series. I am VERY disappointed."
4,Happy,These sheets were very good quality for the money and will have to see how durable they are but am pleased so far. Delivered on time
3,Documentary About Some Unique Soldiers,"They were refugees from Germany and German-occupied Europe, and a few native-born Americans. They were mostly Jewish, and trained together at Camp Ritchie in Maryland. They are old men now, and the movie is their memories of their time in Europe as intelligence agents. Mostly, they were interrogators and interpreters. They also worked successfully in propaganda. In fact, as you would imagine, anywhere that knowledge of the local language and of German was essential.There are some very interesting stories here, but there are also a lot of slow spots. I know one cannot judge documentaries against dramas, but for a documentary, it is good material and too conventional a presentation."
4,Temp control,"Good price, fast shipping.I think it off by a couple degrees so I just adjust accordingly and it stays at an even 68* where I need it for home brewing."
4,Another good Murder She Wrote mystery,"I enjoy all of the ""Murder She Wrote"" books and ""Margaritas & Murders"" was no exception. Like all of the books, this one had an interesting setting and likable characters. I enjoyed this book even without all of Jessica's Cabot Cove friends; I thought it made it more believable that they would accompany her on every trip.If you like the ""Murder She Wrote"" series, then you will enjoy this installment as well."
3,It's Ok...,Got nothing really bad to say... nothing really good to say. This book occupied me for several hours and that was fine.It's a story about staying young. What I don't get is why the South American drug dealers? What is the point of this group? Corporate America should have been sufficient. Readers would have understood but author had to take that cheap and easy route with the drug dealers.I am not impressed with Mr. Braver. I would borrow this book from library instead of purchsing. It isn't worth $5.
4,4 1/2 star,An outstanding biotech thriller. One that will really get you thinking about eternal youth. Fast paced and a quick read makes me recommend this highly.Go get it...
5,funny,My favorite comic. The best part is the author side comment helps understand what goes into writing a comic. Well written. My eight old niece loves these books and is helping her to read.
5,Great Product,"I bought this rack for my front foyer and I LOVE it. I am not sure how this thing can fall apart if put together correctly. All of the pieces are labeled with their letter, and you actually put it together in alphabetical order. *TIP* when putting the lower bars (B) in the foot base (A) lay the piece on is side and apply pressure to force the bars deep into foot base. I have 7 very heavy winter coats hanging on it and it seems very sturdy. Would recommend it to a friend."
5,Finally we are told what really happened!,"""The South Was Right!"" is an essential book for all Americans to read, especially Southerners! About half of the book is devoted to telling us what really happened in the War for Southern Independence. Each incident discussed is backed by facts including letters written by soldiers, official United States government reports, and interviews of people involved conducted in the early 20th century. This book dispells the Northern myth that the Union came down to save the slaves from the ""evil"" Southerners. It also shows that Abraham Lincoln was not so honest; in fact, he was an early Hitler or Huessein. This book is not just for Southerners. It should be read by Northerners too, so that they can realize that the history they have learned is a lie! Please read this book, weigh the evidence, and judge for yourself!"
1,Terrible,"This has to be the worst piece of un-reconstructed, neo-confederate garbage ever offered to the general public. A reviewer made me laugh out loud when I read ""Being that we were not the victors of the War of Northern Agression, we could not tell our story, but had to leave it to the murderuos Yankee generals"". Where to begin with this one. That 'history is written by the victors' garbage is meaningless in a society like ours. Anyone who is educated understands that writing on the Civil War was dominated by southerners (especially Virginians) until well into this century. Modern writing, whether it be by southerners or yankees, still feels the effects of that as writers use the old, southern biased books as sources. What we need is Civil War history with LESS, not more southern bias. Just incredible...."
5,Should be a text book in all southern schools,"I knew this, but made me rethink with more passion. Being from Texas we have a double cultural problem with Yankees."
1,Biased,"Being from the South when I saw this book at the Bookstore, I thought it would be an entertaining read. I've read many Civil War books that you could at least tell that they weren't biased. This one used historical fact and twisted and skew it to make it suit their purpose. Some of the book reflecting the truth, but the large majority of it was the reflection of their bitterness."
1,The North Wasn't Perfect,"This is a simple minded book for those who see things only in blue and grey. The basic thesis is that the North wasn't completely opposed to slavery (there were 236 slaves in NJ, after all); so therefore the south must have been right. Go figure.Don't waste a minute on this thoughtless propaganda. It's not only politically incorrect (as the author proudly points out), it's just incorrect."
1,Disgusting Whitewash,"It's astonishing that this book has been published at all, let alone praised. In the centuries when they raided and robbed the entire world, the British committed crimes so vast that one would expect histories of the Empire to be written in a spirit of shame and remorse. Well, you won't find any shame here, or even a simple acknowledgement of the Empire's atrocities.The lack of any historical conscience whatever is the most stunning (and repellent) feature of the British intellectual world. If you must read this book, read it as a specimen of that horrific lack of shame."
1,Bad Strop,The canvas side is great. The leather was bad. Very hard and dry. I conditioned it with some neatsfoot oil. Still horrible. Find a better strop.
5,Best Monitor Ever!,i recommend this 100% this is the best monitor i ever purchase thanks amazon for this great deal ;)
5,Words of wisdom,This is a brillian adjunct to AA literature. The passages are thought provoking give a great insight into much of the Big Book readings.
3,Bad Production!,"If you're into Batdorf and Rodney, you know how wondeful it is to have at least some CD reference, and how deeply disappointing it is that the duo's catalog isn't on CD. Well, I purchased this CD as an import and the sound mix was/is awful. The song ""Is it Love,"" my favorite on the disc, is obscured at the beginning and the production value throughout the CD ranks below the original vinyl. I was hoping it was just my CD, but I purchased ""Life is You"" for a friend and his copy also sounded muddled. Did I send it back? Ar you kidding?? Getting B & R on a CD, even with a questionable sound mix, is nearly heaven. My vinyl is so worn out it looks like a mountain range and sounds like rain. Now, if we could get the first two LPs on CD, produced by an American company, I'd be absolutely overjoyed. Also, John Batdorf had a nice, acoustic-driven CD out titled ""Batdorf & McLean,"" a few years ago, but it seems it's impossible to find now."
2,Junk. Look for something else,Got the plus one and it is junk as well. Looking for an alternative now. It does come off pretty easy so there's that at least.PS: I peeled off a nice dry piece put it against my mouth (maybe not very wise I know...) and blew some air through it. Didn't stop much of my breath.
4,Plug and Play,"I bought this because I needed a Wireless to Ethernet Bridge. Why is it so hard to find one? I went to several stores online and retail and could not find one in stock. I tried a D-link 5-way router but it turns out that it requires a second identical router on the other end, which was useless to me. These ""game"" adapters are marketed as being for game consoles but I decided what the heck, I'll see how it'll work with my Mac. The manual says that setup required connecting to a PC, but I plugged it in, connected it to my Mac and it found my open wireless network and I was surfing the net right away. No setup was needed. I was wondering whether this deviced was limited in any way since it was sold as a game adapter, but it seems to pass all packets correctly and all ports are open. The only thing I don't like about it is that it runs very warm. I wonder how long it will last."
2,Super Bowl XXXI Green Bay Packers Championship,"I am sure Packer fans will love it. But for someone just interested in a super bowl video, I think this is the worst I've seen. Not the ""traditional"" super bowl video. More of a Packer retrospective. As someone who now owns every super bowl video from the first to the 39th, I was dissapointed."
5,Title Town usa,Being a cheese head this video means alot to me it is great for any football fan especially cheeseheads!! the perfect story of a Perfect season but not Truly about Super Bowl XXXI more about the 1996-97 Green Bay Packers A great movie about a great seoson.
1,How did this become a best seller?,"This book is an emotional appeal that will leave you 'empty'The author does not cite sources. It is sadly true, there is no bibliography. No one in the academic community could get away with this.Do not waste your time reading someone's opinion that is not legitimately cited."
3,Running on Empty an Empty Archetype,"Mr. Peterson's expostulation on the projected deficit crisis and the future of America's retired is a hackneyed attempt to capitalize on economic theory de jeur. It's no more accurate as prediction of some proverbial future than, say, a writer in the 1920's might have in forecasting then the effect of taking the US$ off the gold standard. You can read all kinds of bell-jar theories about economics, all of them linear monotheism in a universe which is anything but. A better title might have been: Running on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Abandoned the Gladiator's Arena for the Imperial Army, and Gave the People Bread and Circuses Instead, Just as Russia Achieved Hegemony over Central Asian Oil and Gas, Developed Electro-Magnetic Nuclear Weapons, and in Doing, Rekindled the Cold War. Or in street language, you don't worry about how much coin you have in your pocket, if you run out of gas in East Compton, LA."
4,"Great to have, but...","It really is great to have (finally!) a collection of Scott McKenzie available, but it seems odd that the entire FIRST album isn't on it, while the good but not nearly AS good ""Stained Glass Morning"" is there it its entirety. Too bad someone hadn't put out a ""twofer"" of those together on one disc.Some of Mr. McKenzie's best singing was during his early to mid-60's folkie Journeymen days ( w/ Papa John Phillips and Dick Weissman). Now if the three albums that group put out were all issued, we'd have a complete package of this wonderful singer's work! The Collectibles compilation CD of that group is darned good, but the complete albums would certainly sell, I'm sure."
1,Junk,Mine is in the mail heading back. I'd be ashamed to keep it and use as a gift. It threw more kernels all over the counter and floor than it popped. Look for another one!
1,Poor doesn't start to discribe it.,"Mr. Navy writes in the introduction: ""This book is intended for the embedded engineer who is new to the field, and as an introduction and reference for those experienced with microcontroller development, but are new to the MSP340 family of devices."" He should have written: ""This book is intended for the people that can't read data sheets, preferring to read the data in a book format (and pay).""There is nothing to learn from this book or very little if you are ignorant of electronics. Mr. Navy seems more like a microcontroller hobbyist with little formal knowledge.I am rating it with one star because it is the minimum, I would have give it zero stars."
3,movie is partially funny.,Asthon kutcher annoys me so perhaps I am biased but the movie is semi-funny. it's not hilarious. I love the owl.3 stars out of 5.
1,Travel immersion water heater,It never workedI need to send it back and try another oneI had one before and it worked great!
1,Didn't hack it,"On my first overseas trip with my immersion water heater, it warmed one cup of water and never worked again. It now is in a Brussels landfill. Can't recommend it!"
5,Loved it!,I love this book! Danielle Steel is one of my absolute favorite authors!!! I used this book for my book report for the first quarter for school. It's amazing!!! One of her best books yet!!! Great job Danielle!!! (:
3,Bittersweet,"This book took me away to another country, and era, that I never bothered with before. Sarah goes through some VERY difficult, depressing times, (even worse than some of MY life)!, I put it down several times,too sad. If you can get past the first 270 pages, the book finally gets happy. I was VERY pleased to see that the female lead in this book, SARAH, is a strong courageous woman, with INCREDIBLE faith. I like the fact that it takes you through most of her entire life, when her children grew up, I was amused at their uniqueness, yet ""true to life"" sameness, of their generation. You get to know everyone so well, it's as if you are a part of their lives, and you don't want the book to end. I enjoyed the last 1/3 of it VERY much, it was worth waiting for."
4,Remembering Rostropovich,"The outstanding performance here is the passionate ""Schlomo"" by Bloch. The Schumann is fine, but perhaps a bit too objective. The R. Strauss is excellent, and the sound is better than on the cd (EMI)with Karajan. The extra documentary is nice but seems somewhat underdeveloped as if it was a rush job. I'm sure there are hundreds (maybe thousands) of minutes of additional material which could have been included, or perhaps another complete performance or rehearsal could have been included. For example, we could have learned more about the great cellest's relationship with his other great contemporaies, such as Richter, Oistrach, and Shostakovich, for starters. But, I suppose we should be greatful for what we have here. Picture quality is somewhat variable in the two pieces conducted by Bernstein (with Artur Rubinstein in the audience!), but better in the R. Strauss. The documentary is generally good visually. Sound is excellent throughout."
4,Quality at a good price,"For the price, this is very good cookware. Here are the only issues/concerns we've had:Slight ""pitting"" (or something) on the inside bottom of some pans after first use.When you are heating up the pans for use, you can hear a tink, tink, tink sounds as the pan heats up."
5,"This cookware is ""hot""!","This set replaced the old non-stick set I had for several years. As advised, I have to watch the temperature, but I haven't needed to work too hard to clean it, even when my daughter discovered that a grilled cheese sandwich left too long on high heat can get a bit dark. Fried an egg this morning with just a little margarine, and it cleaned even easier than the non-stick. The selection is fantastic: I have a size and type for everything I do. After about a month, I would definitely recommend this set."
2,Cuisinart 17 piece cookware,Difficult to clean. I read the reviews for the product and am disappointed with how it cleans up. Would not buy it again.
3,Stainless but not Spotless,"After the first use(and it wasn't anything fancy. Just boiled some corn on the cob in water.), there were spots appeared at the bottom inside the pots. I called Cuisinart and they said they were water spots and gave me instructions to get rid of them. It didn't work. If I want to send them back to Crisinart for repair or exchange, I have to pay for the shipping. Honestly, I was disappointed that a more than $200 cookware set didn't even stay new after just one use."
4,Happy Customers!,"Items came on time, and were in perfect condition. My partner was thrilled with the set. Still need to use it, but it looks great."
2,Not the best quality pots,"Pots look beautiful until you boil water in them, then spots appeared on inside that can't be cleaned out. Called Cuisinart and they said it wasn't their problem, that I should call Amazon. Called Amazon and they were very helpful and sent out another set of pots immediately with return postage for the set I had. Received second set of pots quickly, only to have the same thing happen. Will try and steer clear of Cuisinart products in future. Amazon was absolutely great with their help."
2,Not induction ready,"Had to return the set, which is quite nice, because it does not work on an induction cooktop. Aluminum core prevents this, even though exterior is stainless steel."
5,Graduation Gift,"I think that this set is great! I got this set as a graduation gift from my mom and I couldn't be happier. I had an old mis matched set that was warped and didn't cook evenly. I noticed right away how well the heat was distriputed in the pans and no hot spots. I am a regular mom that cooks almost daily and I am happy with how they sit flat on my stove, cook evenly and are actually a snap to clean up. So I give it two thumbs up and five stars!!"
1,WORST SEASON EVER,"The whole Redemption Island concept ruined the series for two seasons. I am hoping it is gone for good. I seem to be in the minority here, but I have hated Boston Rob since the first time I saw him on Marquesas. He ended up with a starstruck tribe who was too stupid to vote him out and challenges that were obviously geared toward what he's good at: puzzles. In fact, the last immunity challenge coincidentally involved a puzzle; normally they end with endurance challenges which he is NOT good at. AWFUL"
2,Sounds good...,"I find the book to be unbalanced. I believe it could be truly damaging to many people to hear and practice the do-nothing teachings contained in this book. That doesn't mean its not a good book for its genre. Possibly I'm like a Buddhist reviewing a Christrian book for example--just because I disagree doesn't mean that I should rate the book lowly. However, I have practiced the highly-related Tolle teachings with some success and lots of hardship. I believe a more balanced teaching would include both active and passive principles--I felt I could not sell this item in good conscious without reviewing it in this way first."
5,Diamond in Your Pocket,An excellent book if you are looking for information on how to live in the now. The best way at looking at yourself and understanding everyone around you. Gangaji is a wonderful author. She writes of her experiences and puts you as the reader in her shoes so you understand her philosophy. A must read for any spiritual person in search of themselves.
5,what your looking for-,For all those who have had a glimpse of what it's all about and who are looking for a way to live what they know... this book is for you. Gangaji has a gift for putting into words what we know in our hearts.
1,Clear as mud,"I do not recommend this book. It is very hard to understand what the author is trying to say. A good writer would make it clear, easy to understand and entertaining. I can't get through this book."
5,Great Story and Well Told,"Great true story, well told. I thouroughly enjoyed this book. Inspiring and image-invoking. The only down side I found with this book is that it was over quickly, and I was left desiring more."
1,The Facts of Death,"Now this is a lousy rendition of 007's life and death adventures. Sure, it's Bond, James Bond, and sure, he arouses basic insticts in women he meets--be them friend or foe--but this tale is surely lacking in inspiration. The author even brought back Felix, and the two spend an extraordinary amount of time drinking. (Can't people enjoy life without soaking up the booze?)The plot: evil doers are sending toxic poisons all over the world in ""live"" sperm cases. They, of course, have blackmailed a young fellow into being a carrier. And, guess what? One of the baddies is a strikingly-beautiful woman, who Bond, James Bond, somehow manages to seduce (What? James Bond the seducer?) one of the prime villans within the first several pages. B-o-r-i-n-g ! (Figuratively, that is.)Charles A. Reap, Jr., author, ""Devil's Game"" and ""My Friend Sam."""
1,James Bond or Austin Powers?,"What can I say about this book other than it is poorly written. The only thing it has in common with the great James Bond's novels of the past, is that Mr. Benson was allowed to use the character name. Benson should stick to writing computer programs.Do not waste your time or money with this or any of his Bond novels."
2,Benson sometimes make me yearn for Gardner,"I don't why so many don't like Gardner. The man wrote more Bond novels than anyone else, and while of course Fleming was the original and the best, Gardner turned out some very good books (as well as the inevitable bad ones.) But he was a good, established writer, something Benson clearly is not. He's just over his head trying to write novels. Gardner was not perfect, heck, he had me wanting something much more plenty of times, but he at least had a good formula going often, which is what Bond is all about in book and film--formula. The writing from Benson is so bad, and his attempts to recall Fleming are almost pathetic. Perhaps another British spy novel writer can take over this franchise, because I do not want to see it in Benson's hands for too much longer."
2,Disappointing,Most of the pictures were produced after 1970. I was hoping for more early color photographs from 1950 and before; of which they were only a handful.
3,A bit upset with season three DVD,"I've been watching Flashpoint on Netflix because I wanted to get caught up and start watching season 4. I missed most of seasons 2 and 3 because I was attending band camp. So after watching up to the episode ""Acceptable Risk"" on Netflix, I decided to buy all three season, because I absolutely LOVE this show! So today, my DVDs come in the mail and I immediately go to the season 3 DVD so I can watch the next episode. To my disappointment, the last episode in the season three DVD is ""Acceptable Risk."" This greatly saddened me and now I have to go find another place to watch the last episodes of season three. :/ If you're looking to buy ALL the episodes from season three, look somewhere else. Although, if you're content with just buying up to ""Acceptable Risk"", buy all three seasons from Amazon :) Nevertheless, I'm glad I now have them on DVD so I don't have to wait for Netflix to load :D"
1,flashpoiont 3rd season,The 3rd season came with the wrong episodes on the disks and had to be returned. I was very disappointed but if I could get the season with the proper episodes I would purchase them from amazon as they came promptly .
4,mixed season,This has a few episodes of season 2 mixed in with some episodes of season 3. I know it had nothing to do with amazon. Wondering where the rest of season 3 is.
