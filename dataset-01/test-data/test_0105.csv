2,Cheap Grifter--Like the Weinsteins,"Part of the avalanche of bad Weinstein productions going on the market cheap, The Hoax is a bit of a hoax itself. Based not on what actually happened (read other reviews) but what the con man Clifford Irving SAID happened, which makes this a lie on top of a con.No surprise that Hollywood sleaze like the Weinsteins would produce a movie about sleaze, but we don't have to watch it--and we didn't, which is why this is under ten bucks."
2,I don't recommend it,"Poorly organized. Useful neither as a field reference nor study manual. Don't waste your money. Much better investments are: (1) Upgrading And Repairing PCs, Field Guide, by Scott Mueller, and (2) Pocket PCRef, by Thomas J. Glover & Millie M. Young.If you're studying for the A+ Exam, check out 'A+ Certification', by Michael Meyers. Another excellent book which goes into greater depth, is 'Upgrading And Repairing PCs', by Scott Mueller."
4,Good revealing title,Do you feel that you belong into the music business and don't know which career you should choose or just want to know what is available out there? Well this guide will teach you more than you need to know about careers in the music business with advice for each career and help you decide what you want to be or what else you need for your business to run smoothly. A great book not only for people in the music business but also for the average person who wants to have an overlook upon this amazing world and how it works.
4,"First rate, but the hearing impaired should take note.","This 1972 BBC production of War and Peace is wonderful. The acting and directing are superb, and the script closely follows the excellent translation by Rosemary Edmonds. There are some important and surprising differences between the DVD's and the older VHS edition. The DVD's contain some scenes that were not included in the original broadcast. I'm not sure how closely the VHS version matches the broadcast, but it seems to me that the pacing is more brisk and crisp in the tapes than on the DVD's. Also, the VHS tapes have closed captioning, which is a huge plus for hearing impaired viewers such as myself. I was disappointed to find that the DVD's do not have either closed captioning or subtitles. Despite the improved image quality on the DVD release, I'll stay with my old VHS tapes."
2,"Only for the ""Bus People""","We just returned from 18 days of independent travel in Alaska. We had three travel guides: Fodor's, Lonely Planet, and The Milepost. Fodor's is the most generic of the three. If you're on a cruise and you only intend to see what everyone else sees, this book is probably ok; otherwise, opt for Lonely Planet and the Milepost. The bulky section on Vancouver and Victoria is a waste. I love British Columbia, but I already have several BC guides and didn't need it with the AK guide. This may seem petty, but the paper quality of this guide is the worst (too pulpy), and it doesn't stand up to too much abuse - it's not good for backpacks. The one bright spot - we found our lodging in Denali NP in Fodor's and it was one of the (many) highlights of our trip."
5,Great Portable DiVX player-recomended to buy,"This is a great Divx player. I bought it in May this year and using a lot at Health Club when I am on a treadmill. It plays all movies with different format and special Divx. I am not really a technical person and can not explain deep details, but from user side it is friendly. I love it and recommended to buy. Will never regret. Thanks Initial for your product."
3,"I say this out of love, Brent.","I'm a HUGE Brent Spiner fan. I'm also a HUGE music fan, and I do have some formal training. Before my training, this ablum was the bomb, but now its about a C. The material is flawless; these songs have withstood the test of time; that's not the problem. The problem is Brent's voice. Either he didn't have the necessary control or his ear was way off then. I think he does a fanastic job as John Adams in the New Cast Recording 1776, but I also think that he had some formal training to fine tune his voice. If you're a big Brent fan, then maybe the CD is worth $79.00, but don't be disappointed about the quality. If you're not a Brent fan, and want to buy the album for the songs it contains, even if it were twenty dollars, you're better off searching for a 40s Various Artist mix."
3,what is that song?????,Can anyone please tell me the title and artist who sings that song when the three are traveling beside the river in their jeepthing after talking to the Sherrif after pulling into town? Please post a response here on amazon. Thanks!
1,"the actors have talent, but nothing to work with. Horrible...","the actors have talent, but nothing to work with. I couldn't make it through more than 30 min.....Horrible, not funny, and at times it tries to be dramatic and an action flick. No way."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:An uninspired comedy, Without a Paddle is not really funny but it's not offensively bad either: you can certainly find better comedies, but this is not quite the bottom of the barrel."
3,Gen X Goonies,"When our main characters discover a map left by a recently deceased childhood friend.. WITHOUT A PADDLE follows three friends down river in search of a hidden treasure. Although this film covers no new ground it still survives thanks to Seth Green, Matthew Lillard, and Dax Shepard. These three actors worked very well together, even half naked in a spoon position. You'll have to watch the movie for that explaination. Also the two bumbling bad guys were pretty funny as well. So if you're interested in a thinkless good time look no futher."
4,Surprisingly-Not Bad,"When my husband rents a movie featuring Matthew Lillard, I usually find some laundry to do, or go balance the checkbook. However, this was not the raunchy teen comedy I expected. Three friends try to honor the memory of a fourth dead friend by going on a camping/canoeing trip he had planned. Of course, the tree-hugging girls and fat rednecks they meet are the basest of stereotypes, but overall it was actually funny - rather than the disgusting sequence of jokes about bodily functions I expected. (You know what? I think Seth Green may actually be able to act. Sshhh - Don't tell anyone.)"
3,Without a Paddle,"When a childhood friend dies, Jerry (Lillard), Dan (Green), and Tom (Shepard) are reunited at the funeral. While reminiscing about old times, they remember a treasure hunt that they were all going to go on. Discovering maps and plans in their now-dead friend's treehouse, they decide to embark upon a quest for the treasure in the deep woods. These city boys are way out of place and soon find themselves facing a bear, and two rednecks that are up to no good.After seeing this, it seems that they movie is trying to capture the sweetness/grossness of the ""American Pie"" movies. The problem is that with a PG-13 rating, the grossness does not reach the hilarity that was in ""American Pie"", and the sweetness comes off as cheesy. These ""serious"" scenes just do not work. My recommendation is to wait for DVD. You will get some good laughs out of this movie, bu not enough."
5,"Funny, Cute, Silly, a good laugh","OK for kids over 10This was fun. Not deep, kinda silly, but I laughed out loud several times, and that is good enough for me.3 best friends go on a treasure hunt out in the beautiful North West, meeting up with a bear, a couple motley pot growers(Abe Benrubi from ER, and Ethan Suplee, from The Butterfly Effect) and a real mountain man, Burt Reynolds.The money is what they're after, but they find more. Friendship, life, and true values, amongst other things.My sweetheart, Norman and I snuggled on the sofa and watched this while eating leftover salmon. Was nice to relax, no swearing or nudity - so it's OK for the kidlets. Probably not wee kids, but, over 10 or 12.Good fun. Not terribly serious, but, isn't that nice once in a while? I think so!!"
5,Excellent fun,"Fairly typical high school and college aged humor and story line. The endless laughs are enjoyable, what else needs said."
3,Quality Poor but Fun Toy,"I bought this toy for my 5-year-old son as a Christmas gift. As soon as we took the toy out of the box, one of the planes was missing some wheels. You couldn't see that the wheels were missing until the box was opened because of the packaging. One week after Christmas, several other space ships/planes have lost their wheels. My son has not been rough with the toys. I purchased two other space sets for him and their durability and quality has been fine. I would consider purchasing the toy again since my son is having such a good time playing with it and since he is able to learn more about space flight as a result of playing with them, however, I think that the construction of the toy in regard to the wheels is poor and needs to be improved."
3,The horror of learning the truth,"The true horror about this book was learning how The National Enquirer, Star, etc. are now not only not competitors, but all housed in the same building. Then it gets even grimmer when you read how The National Enquirer is trying to go legit...It's all so shocking and sickening. Who wants to read about death as a result of idiot guidance and ownership? Just turned my stomach and, quite frankly, made me sad. Honestly, I'd noticed for quite some time that the Star was losing its edge and this book explained why. It's a case of ""fixing something that ain't broke."" The owner and his team are trying to change what the rest of the media is trying to copy. Shadow-boxing with what?"
1,ouch! HORRIBLE BOOK,"im sorry sachar but this book was NOT good at ALL. Even if its a sequal to the famous Holes book, Caveman (stanley) was my favorite character. what happened to him?!And then,what happend to Hector or Zero? im sorry but people this book was not good enough. =("
4,Small Steps,"Small Steps is a excellent book! Its a companion to the book ""Holes"". Small Steps takes you on into Armpits life after ""Camp Green Lake"".If you like adventure and books that make you want to read more and more as you end a chapter this book is definately for you!:D! In this book, Louis Sachar creates a uplifting ,sad, but happy genre. This book shows how Armpit makes friends and how people look at him differently after he comes back. Armpit made one friend that is mental, she has cybral palsy, and she is younger than him. And everyone thinks that he is weird! But the little girl dosen't think that she thinks he is the greatest thing! If you want to Know more ..then you should read the book it's a excellent book and i strongly advise you to read the book if you have not already!"
5,Five Minutes of Fame,"Small Steps is about Armpit after he's out of Camp Green Lake. He is trying to become more honest and save up money. Then one day X-Ray one of Armpit's old buddies comes up with a get-rich-quick-scheme. They want to buy tickets for a Keira Deleon concert. She is a hot new pop star. Then they sell the tickets for more money.I liked Armpit's attitude, but I didn't like how forceful he was. He was very caring and had a good personality. He is always trying to do the right thing. I also did not like that Armpit did not have very good judgment."
4,CJ is in his usual prime form.,"Smooth tracks with great beats blend into another surreal creation by Bolland. Borderline ambient at most points; dance-able, but more suitable for an armchair listen. Well worth it, but the price may be something to consider (I've seen it for under $16). Domestic US versions are available for at least one of his other CDs (Analogue Theatre). Hopefully a US version will come out for the 4th Sign as well."
3,PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE RIGHT-TO-DIE,"Loretta M. Kopelman & Kenneth A. DeVille, editorsPhysician-Assisted Suicide:What Are the Issues?(Dordrecht, Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2001) 235 pages(ISBN: 0-7923-7142-9; hardcover)(Medical call number: W50P578 2001)Collected papers from a conference in March 1998.The doctors and professors invited to speak were already well-knownfor their views on the question of physician participationin the decision to bring life to an end.Most favor allowing physicians to assist a voluntary death.The issues are explored deeplyas they were understood at the end of the 20th century.But no new ground was broken by these contributors.If you would like to read better (or more recent) books on the same themes,search the Internet for the following exact expression:""Books on the Right-to-Die"".James Leonard Park, advocate of the right-to-die with careful safeguards."
5,Kept me up until 3:00am on a worknight,I'm an active duty military officer and I haven't found anyone as technically on the mark as Herman. He sets the standard. He develops great characters with human frailties--but don't get too attached to any of them. A master story teller! This book is best if you read Warbirds and Force of Eagles (in that order) first.
2,Kindle edition needs work,"First let me say that I would give the printed version of the book 4 or 5 stars. I read it in paperback version 10 or 15 years ago, and enjoyed it greatly.I recently started reading the Kindle edition, and I am finding the typos (OCR errors) very distracting. One example is that the word ""the"" was replaced by ""die"" in at least 36 locations (twice in one sentence). ""She"" was replaced by ""die"" once, and ""them"" by ""diem"" once. There are quite a few other individual errors of this type. In most cases the erroneous word is an actual word (maybe a spell checker was used), just not the correct word.Hopefully Amazon will fix the book and issue an updated version soon. In the meantime I hope they offer ""Force of Eagles"", ""Dark Wing"", and ""Iron Gate"" in Kindle versions soon."
5,Mix up the first time but very responsible Seller!!! GRADE A!,I ordered one of the nerfs and received a different one but i didnt care they responded other than other sellers who do not care ( it is good to know they try to reach out to their customers).... so i ordered another one!!! all in all very promising and will be buying from them again!!!!
5,Excellent actionable desc of successful Christian living,"I have taught Bible Studies for 6 years and this book gave me the most practical advice for bringing Christ and the reality of holiness into my home on a daily basis. Each chapter provides a different perspective of your home (i.e., husband, children, cleaning, holidays, etc) that can have a holy dimension, if we only focus. Thank you, Carol Jo, for writing something that has so touched my heart and my applied life. Excellent personal reading as well as Ladies' Group Bible Study material. We hope there will be an additional printing of this book."
4,Fantastic,I love it.I can't believe it is exist. I love it so much. It's a good help to the persons that are confuse about the verbs.
4,Tastes like dish soap,"My friend owns several of these and buys them frequently for friends and family. I purchased the 750ml in Ice (awesome color) and the 500ml for my 22 month old. My older children each have one of these bottles as well. We have not had any leaking problems. In fact, I bought the bottle for my toddler because even supposedly drip free sippee cups still leak all over. The only problem I have is that the bite valve tastes like the dish soap I wash it in. I even tried putting it through the dishwasher but it still tastes like Palmolive. My friend says all of her bottles have that same dish soap taste. Overall, I am happy with my Camelbak."
5,Wonderful bottle,"I drink alot of water and have had this bottle for over 3 years with no problems. I probably use it 5-6 days a week. It has some scuffs, but the plastic is really durable. Sometimes if you leave it in a hot car, it will build up pressure and leak some, but other than that, it is pretty leak-proof. I love it because there is no lid to mess with, just flip it up to open. Make sure and clean the bite valve and straw periodically as it seems to get black mold/gunk buildup. I clean mine with Q-tips and hot water. The only minor problems/annoyances are: It doesn't fit in the cup-holder of the car and the straw doesn't reach to the bottom of the bottle. Nothing to make you not consider buying it though :o)"
4,Love it!,I bought this for my little girl who loves the bite valve. She would drink from ine and I finally bought her one of her very own.
1,Beware: Leaky Bottle!,"I got this water bottle as a present and was initially super happy with it until ...The lid began to leak after a few weeks. It leaked every time it was on its side. I had so many important papers, books, etc. get soaked because of this leak problem. I thought it was just my bottle, but I read other reviews and realized this is a pretty common problem with these bottles. This is a poorly designed bottle. What's the point of a bottle if it's going to leak all the time?!Also when you are super thirsty, sipping water through the straw is no fun. I found myself taking the lid off so I could get in the large gulps of water I so needed. So, into the recycling bin it went. No more CamelBack for me!"
5,Best water bottles!,"Best water bottle you can buy! I NEVER drank enough water but this bottle helps me drink more! It is portable, easy to clean, easy to drink out of.. Shipping was fast!"
3,It's a love/hate relationship,"I love this bottle for all of its functions & ease of use & how much water it enables me to drink in a day. However, I relaized after I purchased it that Polycarbonate causes cancer. (#7 on the bottom) I still use it and am sad that I have 2 more coming that I had ordered for Christmas presents, not knowing that this was the case. I gave it a 3 because of the cancer thing, I verified this with several web sites."
3,its alright,I don't like this stuff.. hard to clean inside of sucker. and a sucker is easy worn out after using a month!
1,Adult Baby Bottle,"I own four of these bottles so I know when I say that these bottles are not as good as the hype. No matter what you're doing, nobody wants to kill themselves sucking water through a straw. The bite valve is also exposed and gets dirty really easy, especially when backpacking or hiking, and it's tough to clean. It also leaks everywhere if it's turned upside down, even if the valve is closed. Check out the Contigo Autoseal water bottles, they're cheaper, won't leak, are much handier and don't take the effort of sucking through a stupid straw. Camelbak I love you guys but this bottle sucks."
1,I do not like chewing the rubber opening,I just want to drink the water. I would prefer a simple straw. For me this product is all wet.
4,Mostly great but has room for improvement,"I have the black 16 oz bottle.Pros:-Convenient-Pretty colors-Easy to drink from, no tipping needed-BPA-free-Durable-Volume markings in both English and metric units-minimizes straw backwash because of bite valve seal-tapered bottom on this size fits into most cupholders-one way air inlet on lid facilitates drinking-no plastic tasteCons:-Bite valve will grow stuff in it if not cleaned out after use, and drying the thing means pulling it off the cap. My clear valve has some tiny black spots that won't come out.-Straw doesn't reach to bottom of container. If they could put a section of flexible tubing on the bottom of the straw, it would help a lot. Fortunately, this might be fixable with a little DIY.-Bite valve, although mostly protected when folded down, is still exposed to microbes and dirt in the open or in one's bag. I would prefer a flip-down lid that would automatically make the bite valve pop up."
2,Who wants to have to bite down on a straw?,"I was looking for a BPA free water bottle that would hold a lot of water but still fit in my car cupholder and that had a straw but was leakproof. I ordered one of Nathan's stainless steel flip top straw bottles and a Camelbak ""Better"" bottle. The Camelbak has already gone into the recycling bin and I've order more of the Nathan stainless steel bottles so that I have them at home, work and in the car. I found having to bite down on the Camelbak straw annoying and bothersome and that no matter how hard you bite down it is still difficult to drink. The Nathan bottle is BPA free, has a wide mouth so it can be filled and cleaned easily in the dishwasher, the straw is leakproof without having to bite down on it, and it fits in my car cupholder much better than the Camelbak. Plus, the design on the Nathan flipstraw allows you to open and close it witout touching the straw which is great for when your hands are dirty."
5,love this bottle!!!,"loved my first one, bought a second one so when one is in the dishwasher I have the other. No tipping the bottle to sip, no spills in the car seat if it tips over, easy to carry by it's loop, or attach by carabiner to you, your bag etc. Takes hot or cold liquids without impacting flavor, I could not offer an improvement suggestion, I've thrown out all my other ""sport"" bottles."
5,Camelback,I use my camelback on a daily basis. Great for kayaking or hiking or having cold water in the house.
2,Beware of branding,I ordered a chili red Camelbak water bottle for a friend. Upon arrival I discovered that the bottle is branded by the company that sells them through Amazon. In big letters across the bottle was the Moosejaw logo (the company that sells the bottle through Amazon) despite the product description not mentioning this. If you don't mind walking around advertising a company you probably have never heard of this review isn't for you.
5,Superb,"As far as water bottles go, it doesn't get much better than this. These are durable, easy to carry and are virtually leak proof."
5,Great quality and service!,"If you are looking for a top quality product that looks and performs great, this is it! Attractive and durable with options for repllacement components as well. The product shipped right away and arrived with no problems!"
5,Great Product!!!,I was looking for a bottle that would fit in my cup holder and keep my drink cold. This was perfect. I am in my vehicle alot and wanted to have a waterbottle to put water in that would not spill when I hit the breaks or accelerated. This was it. I have 4 of them now in two different sizes. I like the 24 oz size the best.
3,Sippin Water Jar,"Love the size, color choices and price. Having to bite the straw, not so much fun. Like that it fits in all of my cup holders."
4,Good Bottle-doesn't leak... easy to clean,"make sure to pull the nipple off, every couple of times you clean the bottle... and make sure there's no water left in there when you leave it to dry..."
5,"Nice size, great design.","I was looking for an everyday, affordable water bottle to use with my R/O home water that was safe for dishwasher and wouldn't leech plastics into what I drink. Camelbak's BPA free bottle was my end choice (after a bunch of research). Now that I use it, I love the design, it never leaks and is a high quality product. It is perfect for keeping me hydrated and not using expensive Stainless bottles or unsafe store bought bottles. The next bext thing to glass and weighs a lot less!"
2,Good at first,Does what it is supposed to do obviously. The top leaks though after a month or two. Also the bite thingy comes off and you can see all the dirt and grime that gets in there. It is pretty hard to clean. I am just going to stick with the traditional screw off top. I wont buy again or recommend to anyone.
5,One of my favorite possessions.,"I needed to drink more water during the day, so I carried around water bottles. The screw-off top ones never helped, because they were too cumbersome to use. My college roommate, now a clinical psychologist, turned me onto this one.She said humans have an innate 'oral fixation' - basically an innate desire to put stuff in our mouths. This water bottle plays on that with the bite valve. Now, I can't write without it next to me to chew on / drink when I'm thinking. I drink water without thinking about it, just because I enjoy using the water bottle so much. I lost my green one and immediately had another one shipped to me because I hated not having it.If you're trying to drink more water throughout the day, buy this. It won't do you wrong."
5,Finally a Spill proof bottle that is really spill proof!!,"The thing I like most about this water bottle is that its truly spill proof! I have had so many water bottles claim they are only to have a few drips here and there. I can throw this in my bag and not worry about spilling on my mp3 player or phone. It's very durable and I love the color.It doesn't fit in my cup holder in my car, but that's ok because again, i can just throw it on the seat and not worry about it spilling."
1,Drips a lot,The CamelBak BPA-Free Better Bottle with Bite Valve is not what i expected. i like the feel and the easy of drinking. But it drips a lot. i am not sure if it is a defect because i purchased 2 and both drip like crazy. Fortunately i only put water in the bottles.
2,LEAKS AFTER 2 MONTHS!,"I purchased my bottle 2 months ago and it is already leaking!! It was great a first, you could even store it upside down and it would not drip. Now if my bag gets slightly tilted it will end up soaked. Bummer! I never put it in the dishwasher or misused it in anyway, not sure why it is leaking.It was a great bottle in design - love the bite valve - although my jaw was sore the first day when I was getting used to it!Also FYI that the 1-Liter bottle will not fit in any cup holder which makes it a hassle - especially at the gym or in the car-the bottom of the bottle is very wide."
5,drink to go,"Smart looking non-leaking water bottle great for on the go. Top needs to be sqweezed to allow fluid flow, so less chance of leaking in your briefcase or work bag on the way to/from work. Dish washer safe [both bottle, top and straw] so easy to clean up/decon after a cold, between users in a family, or if dropped in a puddle."
3,great product but received an old item,"I bought 3 better bottles and this one in particular does not work properly, seems to be damaged on arrival. The bytevalve does not work when fully extended, it has to be opened halfway for it to work properly,unlike the other bottles I bought."
5,Perfect!,"love the bottles! I got one in fire, which is a great color, and one in pine for my boyfriend, and he loves it too!"
3,"The best bottle, but it causes cancer :-(","I purchased 3 of these bottles, one for myself, my fiance, & my father for Christmas. It is a GREAT bottle. However, it got only 3 stars because it is made of Polycarbonate (#7 on the bottom) & it has been known to cause cancer. I didn't know that until after I purchased them. My own fault. I don't know why CamelBak would use a plastic known to cause cancer. I verified this through several web sites. CamelBak makes another bottle that doesn't. I'm disappointed, and still use my bottle because it is so easy to drink out of. Oh well"
5,Happy,I had one of these bottles before but lost it. Ordered this one from Amazon and am very happy. The bottle is the best I have ever used and does not leak. The shipping was fast and easy.
5,Changed my life,"This water bottle seriously revolutionized my life and how I see water. I carry it around everywhere. It is portable and it's so convenient. I drink so much more water now because it makes it so easy and accessible. Not having to tilt it is brilliant! I have to go to the restroom a lot more because it has me drink more, but that just means I'm healthier. It is a great product and has seriously revolutionized how I see water."
5,Great product,I love this bottle. It's fantastic. The straw never falls off like with several other bottles I've had. The loop/hook is very useful.
5,Nice Bottle,Great little bottle price was right at $8 shipped. seems like it will hold up well! Has the bite feature on the spout which is neat
5,Love these bottles!!,"I can't say enough about these CamelBak Better Bottles with Bite Valve -- several of my friends have bought them after my recommendation, and they love them as much as I do! The concept can't be beat. The parts are very easy to clean in the dishwasher, and I haven't had any problems sterilizing them that way. I bought two, so I can use one while the other is being cleaned. No more accidental spills for me!"
4,"Fantastic, but molds quick and leaks sometimes!","I love this bottle, it is great for everything! Unfortunately after using drink mixes it began to mold inside the bite valve, on the underside of the cap (removed the straw and the rubber valve to find more also), and even on the inside of the straw at times.It comes out with washing, but of course thats pretty difficult with the straw. After a few months of use it began to just leak out of the bite valve for some reason and after I would wake up and take a drink it would spill all over! I use the water bottle for everything - its great to fill up for night time drinks too! Just be careful and wash it out often. If I didn't drink from it quickly or there was some left over in the bottom it would began to mold after a day or two. Otherwise great product"
4,Love it!,"It's great. Very convenient especially when driving. I don't have to tip my head back to have a drink. Not much delivery volume, so when you're really thirsty, it feels slow, but that's really a very minor issue."
4,Good value,"I bought a Nathan bottle earlier and was disappointed in how much it leaked. A friend recommended the CamelBak and it is much better. I like being able to see the liquid volumn. I've dropped it several times and it seems good as new. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I can make it leak around the valve if I shake too vigorously, which is really my problem."
1,not what i thought it would be,"it really is not what i thought it would be. its pretty, but i don't think that the bit part will last for long , then how do you replace it."
5,Great for kids. too!,"In truth, I bought a bright pink Camelbak water bottle for my three year-old daughter to encourage her to drink more water. She loves it and caught on to the drinking mechanism right away (biting the spout and sucking). I love it becuase it can attach to the stroller, backpack, etc. with a clip; it's easy to clean, and it has printed measures on the bottle so I can see how much my daughter has consumed. (And, I can ""challenge"" her to drink a measured quantity.) It looks cool and doesn't leak like practically every sippy cup eventually does--no complaints!!! In fact, the Camelbak water bottle was such a hit with my daughter that I bought one for every memeber of our family; the great array of colors insures that everyone can have his/her own bottle--and there's no confusion as to which on belongs to whom!"
3,The bite valve is weak,"Overall it's OK. After about a year of regular use, the bite valves were broken. It seems the manufacture can do some improvements about this weak part. It's no longer looking good when the plastic body showed scratches after about a month."
5,Keeps Me Hydrated,"This water bottle is perfect! It fits in almost any bag and doesn't leak and it's so much fun to drink out of that I stay extremely hydrated, drinking up to 4 bottles a day! I seriously recommend any Camelbak product"
4,Nice,"This is certainly a nice sports bottle (my wife wanted her own after trying mine). It's convenient to carry, easy to hold, and looks good (if that's important). The straw system is clever, but the draw was a little more difficult than I was expecting. It's not uncomfortable, but you have to want to drink; it's not going to come shooting out of the straw.Overall, very nice."
5,The best water bottle I've ever owned,"I got two of these in the 1 liter size and I love it - I use it mainly for my Bikram yoga classes and I like the ability to get my water without having to lift the bottle off the floor while I'm doing the floor series - I would have liked having other color choices in the 1 liter size since one is for my husband, but I just got a pack of 5 different colored valves and I use the pink valve on my bottle - it's well made, very high quality, and I can see I'm going to have this for years - highly recommended"
2,Hard to keep it clean,The bottle is overcomplicated. It is full of bits and pieces which are difficult to keep it clean especially the bite valve.I stopped using after a couple of days because of the bitter taste it had.I reverted to my simple mineral water bottle (free) which is also much lighter as well.
3,"Nice bottle, but for one annoying feature..","I would give this water bottle a five star rating, but one little annoying thing that knocked it to 3. When you flip the spout up to drink, be careful of spill! I got it all over my clothes the first time I tried. To avoid this, I have to unscrew the lid before drinking, which defeat the purpose of having this bottle. Apparently, pressure start building up inside the bottle (spout down or up) and water start coming up the drinking straw. Then when you flip it up, sort of a pumping action, water will come out of the straw. I stopped using it in my office for this reason. I would have return it, but didn't think it worth the hassle.Other than that, it is a nice bottle. Water tasted good, unlike some metal bottle that you always have metallic after taste."
2,I wonder what the title of the album stands for...durrrr???!!!,"This album F or U nlawful C arnal K nowledge is the worst Van Halen next to VH3. ""Right Now"" is the only descent song on it and thats not because they play it on the radio all the time! They tryed to rock harder but it just doesnt do it for me. Hagar has ruined this band. PeeUUU!!!!"
2,Good if compared w/ other Van Hagar albums,"I can't believe how many people are giving this album rave reviews! Although Hagar's lyrics are more mature than Roth's, they are also much more bland. Eddie seems to have turned in to more of a rythm guitarist here as his crazy guitar solos and tapping segments are absent here. I can't even understand what Hagar is saying in Poundcake. Maybee this is a good album next to other Van Hagar music, but compared to the origonal Van Halen, and other relatively good rock and roll groups of the time, this album seems very plain. On the other hand, if you like Van Hagar, go for it. It's one of their better albums."
5,Nancy Drew,"The Nancy Drew FilesMurder on IceCarolyn KeeneNancy Drew books have always one of my favorite things to read. They are very entertaining and keep me wanting more. Murder on Ice is by far myfavorite Nancy Drew book. I love the way it flows and I never gotconfused about what was going on. Nancy Drew had gone on a ski trip withNed, Bess, and George. She met Liz, the ski lodge owner, and she saidthere were some suspicious activities going on. So it was up to Nancyagain. I like how the story's plot is, and how everything seems sonormal, but then something happens to change it all. The events thathappen almost seem real. I can always picture what's going on. And Ialmost feel like I'm there with her.wannabe310"
4,Love this but beware the install...,"My husband and I love this product. If you are considering purchasing this, please beware that the install is anything but simple. In the end we had to have the cart put on a jack, remove the rear tire and install from beneath. If we did not have a friendly neighbor with the right equipment, the install would not have been done. It definitely cannot be installed on the brace as it indicates can be done.When we need to change the water we have to remove our golf bags and make sure the cart is parked where the water can run. There is no neat way to do this so you just pull the plug and let it run.The product works great. But due to the difficulty of the install and cleaning, I can only give this 4 stars."
2,Eh.,"The story, which is rather spare in versions I've read up to now, is nicely fleshed out by Cooper - she's a wonderful story-teller. The art, on the other hand, is absolutely insipid and amateurish, the cover-art being the best of the lot. For me, a picture book is largely about the pictures - if I'd been in a book-store and been able to actually leaf through this book, I would not have purchased it."
1,Not very professional!,"This was very slow moving and didn't teach me anything. Just women wiggling to slow music. It didn't seem to be real dancers trying to teach anything new or different at all. No rhythm, no excitement, no dancing as such. Even my husband was bored. I've done some very basic classes and have seen housewives more inspiring. This will go into our next yard sale."
4,fun to watch easy to learn,this is a good idea if you have no clue on how to give a lap dance.they give you basic instructions so you can catch on easiy.i learned some moves. the instrumental CD was a great bonus.only problem is it only playes in my lap top computer.
1,Garbage,"Don't buy this dvd. All the dancers are horrific. They don't show you how to really stip tease effectively. Anyone can do everything they do and more without any lessons. It is a home video. This is just a warning, we were very displeased with this product."
1,"Trashy, amateur video","This dvd was so trashy, and amateur. Two of the women dancing on the guys totally grossed me out. It was really sleezy. I would never purchase this or recomend it to anyone. Absolutely terrible."
5,Great Keyboad! Give it a Try!,I have not had many Keyboards and read all reviews before buying. I find them to be so helpful and am grateful for all who take the time to write them. As many said before me this one is highly rated nice feel to keys not super heavy. I do not use all the extra keys. Very easy to install. The Price can't be beat!Definitely very happy so I had to write a review!
4,Great Keyboard for the Cost,"Bought this keyboard for it's great/many reviews and it has lived up to them so far. I've had it for about a month now and everything's still working fine, keys are still quiet even after having written several lengthy papers. Very nice to have the wrist support and it's great having the hotkeys (especially the music ones that actually work with iTunes!). The Zoom slider isn't all that great (was hoping it'd do something along the lines of Mac's magnify feature) because there's no option to go back to original size after zooming in/out and it's not smooth."
2,Nice but not strong,"I am glad that this multimedia keyboard has a very good feel and the software worked well without problem. I used this keyboard for both gaming and typing and I really liked it for some time.But only few days after I bought the keyboard, I found out that this keyboard is not too strong; the flip feet underneath suddenly broke and my keyboard cannot stand anymore.Too bad, I see other people with the same keyboard and same problem. Even on one case, some stuffs on the lower part of the keyboard that connected with the flip feet also broke as well, don't know why.The only reason I give this product a 2-star ratting is because the multimedia button, the feel of the keyboard and also the ""problemless"" software.Should be 5 star if the keyboard is stronger, too bad. I am planning to get a new logitech g11 to replace this keyboard, hope it will work well with me."
4,nice and easy to use,"I haven't used all of the features, but I like the way this keyboard feels. The legs to stand up the back of the keyboard are a little flimsy, but not bad, and as long as they are all the way back, it will stay.I went back to a wired keyboard due to issues with my wireless. I ordered this rush because I couldn't use my other. I didn't spend much time testing keyboards like I normally would have. (First time ordering one online, I always go to the store so I can feel them.)I am pleased."
5,I Love This Keyboard!,"From the old school and wanting the basic feel of a keyboard did I ever get my monies worth on this. The keys are designed smooth, fast and has a wonderful feel to them. The newer keyboards make me feel like I'm playing a massive pipe organ with a thousand buttons and wrap around commands. This is straight keyboard with hot buttons that work just great for someone who isn't into a gazillion features but want more than just ABC. It's comfortable to me and I just love it!"
3,Norwegian English pocket dictionary,"Was not clearly labeled as pocket dictionary. It is very condensed, with just the bare translation into the other language."
1,Not a very high quality toy,"My daughter was so excited about ordering this toy, she had a lot of fun with it, for about an hour. Then the music wouldn't play, the key wouldn't work, it just generally fell apart. It definitely wasn't the quality I generally expect from Mattel."
3,CONSCIENCENESS.......,"NOW it IS that kind of work and more.Dying Author John Gielgud reflects with guilt on his long life, which includes the suicide of his wife [Elaine Stritch]as welll as other moments of regret.NOT a depressing work, it's a thoughtful moving moody study of this man and his family. It's a sad work, that has to be visited and revisited, encompassing a grand score by Miklos Rosa, and those unique Resnais touches [the frozen sea in frame, but we hear waves crashing!] - when you recall with specific focus a moment [real and animated]but its surrounded by an immobile, frozen landscape [like ""Last Year at Marienbad"" an earlier and more satisfying work].The rest of the ensemble? Ellen Burstyn, Dirk Bogarde [always spectacular, always taking risks] and David Warner [the werewolf?].Elegant and thought-provoking this work deserves a proper DVD restoration.Also see ""Hiroshima, Mon Amour"" - excellent companion."
1,Horrible...,HORRIBLE... I sent back the item and have not yet seen the credit to my account. The item was horrible. It was discolored and useless. Will never but from this company again.
1,Utter junk,"These are junk, too flimsy and the covers don't stay on if you hold them upside-down. Complete waste of money."
3,Good and Bad,"The Movie in itself is excellent. The DVD, however, jumps tracks and as I threw away the receipt and packing, I am stuck with it."
2,Trash at it's best!,"...The film is 50 minutes too long and it's overproduced and overacted. It's too bad! With a better producer and director, Sidney Sheldon's book could have been great. I've never read the book so I can only imagine that it's better than the movie."
5,Peter Cant rules!!!!!!!!,"Although the content of the film leaves room for improvement, I have watched this movie so many times and i think that peter cant is the greatest actor in it. You are my number one fan, peter!"
2,Love Neil -- Bluegrass Not So Much,"Gee, guy from Texas, Wayne is it? Neil himself would not claim to be John Lennon, but one of the things I loved best about his version of Imagine was this: ""imagine no possesions -- I wonder if *I* can..."" what a simple but significant change from Lennon's lyric ""I wonder if *you* can"" -- which I had not til then recognized for the patronizing attitude it is. I love John Lennon, Paul McCartney, the Beatles, Neil Young, and myriad artists who dare to challenge each other with their music. If you didn't like Neil in the first place, why complain about what you got?"
4,great musicians play Neil Young,"This is a wonderful album, but if you want more, don't look to Neil. Look to recordings by the group as individuals. Listen to David West's ""Arcane"", or the Acousticats, or the Cache Valley Drifters. Or the Transyvania Mountain Boys for Giles Apap. For beautifully sensitive mandolin work, check out Mike Mullins playing on ""Home by Morning"" by the criminally underrated Paul Edward Sanchez from Austin, Texas. Also, even though he's not on the Young tribute, give a listen to fiddler Phil Salazar; all roads lead back to him."
3,"Get ""Hacked Up..."" or ""Chainsaw Dismemberment"" first","The first 5 songs are really good typical Mortician songs. My main problem with this album is the vocals in the last 4...You can barely hear him even when reading the lyrics, and the covers dont even have lyrics! But, on the bright side of those, theyre very loud. I would start off with either Hacked Up for barbeque, or chainsaw dismemberment. In Hacked, you can hear the ""vocals"" a little better. In Chainsaw, it's louder and more distorted."
3,"Brutal death, cheesy drumming","I think this is a good cd for death/grind fans. The only complaints i have are the vocals are way louder than the music and the drumming is done by a drumming machine. I love the vocals but they could be lowered. Extremely heavy and fast, lyrics not for the queasy. Has a Cannibal Corpse-ish touch. Not Relapse's best, but a talented 'band'."
5,Witchy Madge Byrd Loved This Book!,"""Finally, thank the Goddess, a literate, witty, accurate novel aboutmodern day witches and pagans--not to mention one timeless (and timely) vampire. Ardinger has a great sense of voice. Her use of language is pithy and economical; there is not one sentence to skip. If you're prepared to stay up all night, compulsively turning pages, laughing, crying, and biting your fingernails at the suspense, buy this book!"""
1,UNKNOWN CHANGES,"I was EXTREMELY disappinted in what I ordered and what was shipped. Yes, it was the same book (I assume). But, the cover is different. And, the print is so miniscule that I simply cannot read the words.The reviews on this book are great. And, I really wanted what I had ordered. But, at my request two other people have looked at what I was sent and each said they could not read it due to the extremely small print.With prior Amazon orders I might not have liked the publication in part. But, to have shipped something that literally cannot be read is seemingly deceptive on someone's part.I hope Amazon will screen its products better than this one was screened."
2,the goalposts are moving backwards,"It seems every book on evolution nowdays spouts a new version of how we got here. This book is no different. What the authors are doing here is obvious: Because life is adaptive and evolves purposefully, these guys are trying to construct this reality onto a foundation of accidents. It's a truly laughable premise that is so funny it almost hurts. This book is almost worthless. If this book were a political persuasion it would vote ""moderate."" And it's absolutely a joke that any book written on evolution would leave out a detailed discussion of subjects such as epigenetics, horizontal gene transfer, and environmentally-induced gene expression. The last of which touched on in this book, but only fleatingly. This book is good for one thing: taking neo-darwinism one step closer to the trashcan where it belongs. This is one last attempt to save a dying theory."
3,The book is great,"Unfortunately the copy of the book was in poor condition and I returned it for full credit, however, the book was resent back to me. I have no idea of why, and have absolute no use for it since it was purchased as a gift."
2,Taming And Training Cockatoos,"This book don't have much on how to train your bird.It only tell you a few starter points if your bird is wild. Mostly has pictures of different type of cockatoos and telling about them, It also has about clipping wings and nails. If you want the basic of two steps in tamining and training this is the book for you. Too me the title don't go with this book !!"
4,Iraq Study Group,"The first sentence in The Iraq Study Group Report caught got my attention. It reads: ""The situation is grave and deteriorating."" That one statement says it all in my book so I wanted to read on. It's heavy reading if you are not totally literate in this part of the world, it's a way to become knowledgeable. Also includes the maps of this region and a list of those who contributed and background information for each."
4,An informative study of Iraq,"The book is a good way to get to know the culture as well as the political environment in Iraq, not to mention revealing interesting ideas on the US' options in Iraq."
3,Somewhat informative,"If you have an interest in being up-to-date on US policy toward Iraq and that region, as well as some of the thinking that is behind the current US activities, then this book is a worthy read. You'll be able to get through it in one sitting if you want. Obviously, it doesn't have much of a shelf-life, so get it now or consider it an interesting historical document before too long. It's not going to blow your mind, it's rather repetitive at points, but otherwise it's a decent read for someone interested in the subject matter, even if just to reinforce some things."
4,Its time for the healing to begin.,"The publication of this report is a landmark in American history. For too long partisan self-righteousness has ruled over sensible decision-making, and this report marks the momentous reconciliation of the right wing.What you get out of this report depends upon your willingness to keep an open mind and any extremist (both sides) will think this defends their point of view. However, it's remarkable at drawing your perspective closer towards the center.I think the recommendations in this book are spot on, but practical wisdom tells us that about 25% may come to fruition. (That's why I only gave 4 stars)By the way, they even knew to keep it short so George can read it. Just kidding."
5,A book that transcends sports,"Finished The Perfect Mile last night. It's one of the bestsports books I've ever read. You will enjoy it whether you ran track, jog to keep in shape, or just plain enjoy a quality biography. It's very well written and researched. You will find yourself pulling for all three runners in their quest for the four-minute mile (Bannister, Landy, Santee). Do yourself a favor, read this book. It's a must read."
5,I loved this book,If you enjoy running and reading. This is an awesome story. I didnt want to put the book down.
4,"magic, magic where art thou?","Terrin the Texas wizard and his good buddy Myhr (rhymes with purr), are in the middle of being thrown from world to world (like the TV show sliders) when they land in one which quite literally sucks the magic out of people. This is bad news, as magic is how they move from world to world and both of them want to get home!Myhr is half man-half cat and all fun. This is a light hearted romp that takes you to hell and back, but doesn't take itself too seriously in the process. This is a distinct change of direction for the author Elrod who is better known for her vampire novels.If you want an enjoyable fantasy with some interesting and funny characters then this book is a good read."
4,Truth or dare,"I had the good fortune of hearing an interview with the author on NY public radio station WBAI this morning, so it was very interesting to log onto this site to see that the reviews given by Publishers Weekly and Booklist were blocked out. The story is that a mainstream press book critic lambasted this book but the critique's publisher was later forced to retract it because it was full of inaccuracies -- that is, what he was saying to justify his stance on the book was factually untrue....1984 has come and gone, but the Orwellian nightmare is alive and well in America."
4,A 70's flashback,"My mom used to buy me these RCA Camden Elvis albums because they were low priced. So I was ecstatic to get one with Elvis' biggest hit of the 70's as the title track. In a better world, though, ""Burning Love"" would've been saved for an album of all new material from Elvis. Combine it with other tracks recorded around the same time (like ""It's a Matter of Time"", also on this album/cd; ""Separate Ways"", ""Always on My Mind"", ""Fool"", ""Where Do I Go From Here""), and it would be a good, contemporary album of 1972 Elvis. As a budget release, though, this is pretty nice. Sure, a lot of the songs in Elvis' movies weren't top drawer, but the ones here are very enjoyable, even if they weren't ""hits"". ""Tender Feeling"", ""Am I Ready"" and ""No More"" are among his better movie ballads, he sings every song wonderfully, and the instrumental support is always excellent. This is a cd I play a lot, it brings back a lot of memories."
3,Hits from his movies? What hits?,"Of course everyone complains about the fact that he had enough new material to make a really good album, but if RCA was going to release one new hit with songs from his movies then at least pick the better ones. Calling these hits would be a stretch even for the biggest Elvis fan. Some of the selections are descent tracks such as Tonight Is So Right For Love and No More. Seriously though Guadalajara might be the worst record in the history of recorded sound. At times it don't even sound like a song just a bunch of noise. Santa Lucia isn't much better and I Love Only One Girl is pretty hard to get through as well. I don't think their intention was to put hits from his movies on this album but songs that weren't given much attention that they thought should be given a second chance. A few of them they may have been right with but a few of them are really bad."
4,Anecdotal history at its best,"I bought this book thinking that it would be a history of the English country house, but it turned out to be something quite different. Mr. Heald travels around to country houses around the country and interviews their owners. The result is a delightful book that is somewhere between oral and anecdotal history. We hear, first-hand, about what it is like to own a vast estates. Mixed in with the reports of his conversation there is indeed some history of the individual houses.It is sort of a light read, and there isn't really any delving into skeletons in the closet, but it is still a very interesting book. It would make a perfect gift for someone who enjoys country house touring."
4,Very Good Album,"Dexter Freebish, one of the many alternative bands that never really made it, but still found some crowd that likes them, put out a good debut release back in 2000. This is recommended for anyone that misses the simple mainstream music in the year 2000 and wonders where all these artists went (Dexter Freebish just put an album out this year by the way), and you will not be disappointed for anyone who has just discovered this.P.S. Most of the reviews for this album have mistaken this for an album of Civil War era folk music. What's up with that?"
5,Solid First Novel,"Tightly conceived, well-constructed, Los Santos brings to life the greed and intrigue of Peru - both past and present. Written from the insider's vantage point of an American foreign service,the book serves to remind us of some basic human qualities: man's desire for gold, adventure and justice."
4,Pretty Good for A Protein Shake,"I have tried several other whey protein supplements both premixed and powders. This one, along with the Vanilla Flavor is the best by far. The SportPharma brand mixes much better than any of the powders that I have tried."
3,A noble failure,"Director Otto Preminger's stab at the George Bernard Shaw play was pilloried for the miscasting of Jean Seberg in the title role, but she's hardly the sole reason why this well-intentioned film version doesn't work. Richard Widmark gives one of his silliest screen performances as the Dauphin, and many of the smaller roles are quite hammily portrayed as well.Still, this VHS version does include a very well-made behind-the-scenes featurette (for once, you don't have to have a DVD player to enjoy this sort of extra). SAINT JOAN is still worth seeing, if only to appreciate how much more confident an actress Seberg would become in BONJOUR TRISTESSE (also directed by Preminger) and, of course, in Godard's BREATHLESS.(And if you're a fan of this movie or of Seberg in general, don't miss Mark Rappaport's amazing un-documentary FROM THE JOURNALS OF JEAN SEBERG.)"
1,A BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT,"My technical experience with this DVD is best described as that of bitter disappointment. The DVD misfunctioned in my DVD player. I ordered a replacement and the dysfunction was the same. The video skipped and stalled. I cannot understand how Warner Brothers Classics could issue such a product. Also there exists a VHS version which has the MAKING OF JOAN OF ARC as a trailer. I wonder why this format was not duplicated for the DVD version.The film and the subject matter is great. The technical quality of the DVD is bitterly poor, diappointing."
2,UNAPPROPRIATE MATERIAL,I FOUND THIS BOOK TO HAVE MANY RACIAL REMARKS AGAINST AFRICAN AMERICANS. SOME THINGS YOU JUST KNOW AND DON'T NEED TO BE SAID. THE CONSTANT PPOINTING OUT OF HOW MANY BLACKS ARE CRIMINALS AND HOW MANY BLACKS ARE POLICE OFFICERS IS IRREVELANT IN THE STUDY OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE. CRIMINALS ARE OF ALL RACES AND SO ARE POLICE OFFICERS. I WOULD NOT SUGGEST THIS BOOK TO ANYONE WHO WANTS A CAREER IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE FIELD.
3,Nice book but my kids like the CD - and you'll have to buy it seperately,"As a child of the '70s who grew up on Free To Be You And Me, I was excited to learn that Marlo Thomas and Friends had published another collection! This nicely illustrated book includes a whimsical variety of stories, poems, and songs as well as a teaser CD with three of the selections performed by famous people (much like Free To Be You And Me). I was mislead by the discription into thinking that all of the selections would be included on the CD and was very disappointed to find that they weren't. I ended up ordering the complete CD seperately and my kids really do love it. The book is nice but if you have to choose one or the other, I would recommend the CD."
5,The Reivers,The DVD arrived promptly. I assuming it's a good copy as I haven't had the opportunity to watch it. The movie is my favorite from 1970.
5,Vitamin Supplement,I give 2 of these to my large breed dog daily and she enjoys them! I don't have to hide them in food or bribe her to eat them. She loves the flavor and gladly gobbles them up. Excellent source of vitamins for a healthy pet.
4,"If you have doubt, please reconsider...","I have been a long-time fan of Muse, beginning with Absolution, then heading back to ones which soon became my favorites. I loved Showbiz and it's deep mood and the different sound Origin of Symmetry showed. When I heard the single Knights of Cydonia, I was surprised at the difference between it and my favorites. I HAD to buy the record, and after a few tries, it grew on me. I know it's not as hard as Absolution, or as emotional as Showbiz, or as 'scream-y' as Origin of Symmetry, but if you're okay with change and a pop sound, you may like it. Still not my favorite album, but it is worth the money for the few incredible cuts."
5,Muse rocks,"If you already like Muse then you will naturally love this cd, if you don't know them then this is a good one to start out with. They are rock stars after all, so it was fun to see them in the DVD."
4,4 1/2 stars for some big time sounds.,"this is an ambitious, big-sounding swing for the fence of superstardom. and it is really excellent. ""Q"" magazine picked this as the 2nd best album of 2006. that's where i heard of it, and i'm glad i did. fans of ""the verve"" or ""the doves"" should find much to love here. excellent, powerful songs driven by an outstanding job of production. this is music that fills a room with sound. i highly recommend the thing."
5,The best album ever!!,"Muse are the best thing that happened to the music world in the 21st century. They have created something totally their own that no one can mimik, and this is their best so far. It doesn't matter how many times you listen to it, it keeps amazing you over and over again."
3,Is it Muse or Radio Head ?,"Muse is no doubt quickly becoming a sensation in the music world. They have all the elements of a band with a big professional sound. While I give full credit to Muse for all the hard work and passion they're putting into their music, if I didn't know who they were, I would swear I was listening to Radio Head. Does no one else hear the unmistakable similarities between the two bands? I'm a big Radio Head fan, and very familiar with their signature sound. While it is perfectly fine to use influences from favorite bands to help develop one's own sound, the Black Holes & Revelations album sounds like a dead ringer for Radio Head, to the point where it is uncanny, and perhaps inappropriate to call the sound their own.Not to be indignant to Muse, but I suspect I am not the only listener who feels this may be too much of a ripoff of Radio Head. Perhaps Muse will carve out more of their own original sound with future albums."
2,Disappointing!,"I was a huge fan of Muse. That is up until this album came out. To keep this short, I was bored to the point of turning it off. It was repetitive and obviously lacked creativity. If you liked any of the previous ones, don't buy this one."
1,Muse jumps the shark,"As a BIG Muse fan, I couldn't wait for this disc to come out in the US. I even ordered it wihout having heard a single note from it. Unfortunately, I was immensly disappointed. This album is as completely different from Absolution and previous efforts as you can get. But it's not a good difference. There is one, count 'em ONE song on this disc that I'll call Muse-worthy, that being City of Delusion. The rest of the disc is just a god-awful mess, that does not even sound like the same band.Most of the songs sound like depeche mode dance tunes, except for the dreadful ""knights of cydonia"" which, I swear, sounds like Europe. Remember Europe? - ""The Final Countdown?"" Yeah, there's a reason it went away.Damn it, Bellamy - I want my favorite band back!"
3,Absolution was better,"I do like this album a lot, dont get me wrong, but I fear it doesnt quite get up there with Absolution and others. I think Muse's choice of 'Supermassive Black Holes' as one of their singles was a mistake coz i think its one of the worst on the album. There are so many other tracks on this album that are far superior. I do like the song but dont love it. Overall this is a good album tho and if you are a MUSE fan then you have to have it. You wont be dissappointed with tracks like 'Starlight', 'Map of the Problematique', 'Exo-Politics' and 'Knights of Cydonia'."
3,Poor Jodee,"This is an autobiography of Jodee's struggles all through school. She tries to stand up for what is right and gets shunned and ostracized. She keeps wanting to ""fit in"" but doesn't know how without being untrue to herself. Near the end she finally gets some real friends. She takes a lot of abuse from kids who once were her friends, but deals as best she can looking forward to her future at college. It was sad to hear how cruel the kids were to her, but I thought her parents should have helped her by paying for some self-defense lessons instead of taking her to a psychiatrist. They knew she was getting beat up by kids at school and just made things worse. I think teens would especially like this book."
3,"Tough Story, Too Much Detail Remembered???","I read this book because my teenage daughter read it. While an interesting story from a kid who was bullied throughout her middle- and high school years, sometimes it felt contrived - some of her memories were too detailed to be believable."
3,Too many horror stories - but where is the Inspirational message?,"I read Jodee's book and can't believe the torment she went through with her classmates. I know kids tease but what was happening to Jodee was pretty extreme, especially the physical abuse she endured. What was the inspirational message? I could not find it. It was one horror story after another, and then a lot of bragging about her career toward the end of the book. But on the other hand I can see where she is coming from with her bragging, even as an adult, she still wants to be accepted by that 'cool crowd'. Anyway it was an interesting read and I wish Jodee the best!"
2,BAD BAD ENDING,"Ok, the book was good up until the end. I can believe that the same things happened to her at all the schools. I just figure she kept trying to be with the cool kids instead of the regular kids to some degree. She admitted it herself, such as naively taking their invitations over and over again. Why she chose to take gym all of a sudden was weird though. However, I hope no poor kid gets to the end and thinks that gaining the approval of these people at a class reunion is something to aim for. If a kid is being bullied by a large group of people, why indicate to them that some day, even if it takes years and years, you may actually be liked by them? That is an insane message. That's probably why the book didn't do as well as it could have.I feel sorry for the kid who read that book with hope and then got to that ending."
4,Insightful book about bullying,This books gives a good perspective on what is it like to be a victim of bullying and how traumatic it can be for children and adolescents.
1,Just awful,Pure and utter emotional masturbation on the part of the author. I was so excited to see the topic explored in print to just be that much more disappointed at its shallow translation. No insight whatsoever as to the psychological and sociological causes or effects of bullying.Unfortunately we hear story after story of children killing themselves due to bullying sometimes at the tender age of 6. I hope we eventually see a well written book that explores the topic in depth and provides some ideas for solutions.
3,Buy It Used,"Interesting account from a young girl who obviously has very little self-awareness or insight into her own behavior. Too bad she did not see have at least one friend or cousin (with all those aunts, didn't she have cousins??) to tell her to tone it down a little with the self-righteous act. There are some odd thought processes described by the author. Bordering on delusional at times. I'm very sorry that she was bullied, but I think she is incredibly histrionic, and her victim stance may have served a bigger purpose for her AND her family. One has to wonder. She is very black and white in her views of the world to the end, and very naive. I held my breath, as she talked about how much these people had grown, and become such kind, wonderful human beings. So naive, it may never even have occured to her they were being incredibly nice, knowing the book about them was about to go to print. I think her former classmates may have been doing a little CYA. Just a thought ....."
2,Strickly a history book,"Oddly enough, this is a book that kept me up till 2 am, and I didn't like it. I kept thinking, ""Surely she'll get to the meat soon"" and she never did. As one of my fellow reviewers mention there was no introspection here, no thoughts on how to prevent bullying, how to help children deal with it. This book states plainly ""This happened to me"". Having had similar things happen in my own life, it made quite sad, and offered no hope or wisdom to soothe the wound. This was half an important book, but the important part is missing."
2,Problems with the seal,"First of all, one of the 3 bottles I ordered was missing part of the mounting kit. Since I only needed one, I wouldn't bother to return it for that alone. Beyond that, though, the gasket on one of the caps is twisted, making this one impossible to seal correctly (i.e., without dripping). I had this kind of bottle before, and I know it takes a while to get the lids to seal properly, but this does seem to be taking a long time, with resulting floods in my birds' cages. I may end up returning all 3."
4,Lixit bottle for small birds,One bottle works great. The second bottle drips and no matter what I do it still drips! Anyone have any tips?
3,Okay for the price ...,"To be blunt, if I had more than $30 bucks, I'd spend the extra $20 on a better quality mouse.I used this mouse for about a month before it started to show it's true colors, literally ...The skin color (The grayish portions) will start to fade to a blackish, dark metal color in little over two to three weeks.Two months after getting it, it already needed replacement.The presicion was off to begin with, with two months in use, it was no where to be found; this mouse was jumping all over!Finally, I decided it just simply wasn't worth it in the long run.To put it simply, if you want a short term mouse to keep you going 'till you get a better one, this is one of the most afforable ones.I'll be honest, the first week and a half, I had high hopes for this little guy; he got the job done then.After that week and a half, though, you better hope the delivery man is by the door."
4,keep this book handy,This book should be on the desk of every J2EE architect. Not sure if some of the design patterns still apply for JEE5. We'll just have to see in the next edition.
4,A pratical guide for self discovery and success,"This book offers clear and practical reading for anyone interested in taking a quick inventory of their God given abilities and learning how to focus them for a more productive and joyful life. It is concise, to the point and filled with down to earth applications that each reader can grasp and use immediately. In the books 153 pages you will find with each chapter a list of practical questions that will start you on an action plan of your own. For anyone who has been a fan of Dr. Maxwell Maltz,author of ""Psycho-Cybernetics""(who also wrote the introduction to this book) you will not be disappointed with your time spent here. I predict you will add this one to your list of books that must remain in your personal library."
2,"Earth Magic: A Dianic Book of Shadows, A Guide For Witches","I understand Dianic wichcraft to be a tradition based on wimmin's spiritual mysteries. So, it was misleading when I read 'Dianic"" in Marion Weinstein's book of shadows guide. It could be ignorance on my part. Or it could be that I am frusrated by the lack of information on wimmin's mysteries. Who knows?"
5,A novel that shows the end of innocence in a magical way,"This is, with no doubt, the brightest book of this exceptional peruvian writer. Bryce has the ability to make you cry and laugh as you identify your own growing experience with the life of the main character, a little boy named Julius. The author makes us see why some things that have no importance when we are a kids later become the center of our existence, such as looks, political opinion or social status. This novel is delightful and is written with really good taste and sensibility. Since you begin to read it, you will find yourself trapped in a beatiful and sharp story about the social realitys of southamerican countries."
2,Buster Keaton Triple Feature,This is very cheap and when you see it you'll know why.The picture quality is o.k. but the main film Keaton's classic The General has been transfered at the wrong speed.Everything seems to be happening in slow motion.The other two films (The Blacksmith and The Paleface)seem to be at the right speed but The General is the main feature on this disc so I would advise looking for another copy of this classic film.
1,Loved the Movie - So sad they've changed the music,"We rented ""The General"" and LOVED IT! I bought this version and when I watched it I discovered they've changed the musical score. Can you imagine changing the musical score on a silent movie?!!! The music was changed to a classical instrumental score. My 10 year old son, for whom this movie was purchased, was very upset and we haven't watched the nasty thing since. Hello, in a silent movie the music is one of the characters and is just as important as anything you see on the screen!It was disappointing!"
4,Ooooh so camp,"Movies like this always brings back memories, maybe it's just all the sun,surf and tanned bodies. Gidget movies will never compare. I loved the campness,the ridiculous back drops, acting, weak plot, but it's still enjoyable and definately for the older girls!! These types of movies you just can't rent from the local video shop - well not in Australia anyway. Enjoy it for what it is, clean fun!!"
5,"Great product, smells so good!","The S factor line of products is excellent, not only the shampoo and conditioner, leaves the hair looking healthier and it gives shine, plus the smell. Is the best in the market!Johanna"
2,here he is again....,here comes casper again. with his mean uncles.casper the friendly ghost. not as good as the first one.but good enough if your kids loved casper and want to see him again.
4,"I Liked It More Than I Liked The Bill Pullman, Christina Ricci movie!","I watched the original theatrical movie that starred Christina Ricci and Bill Pullman, I watched it on a video tape and while that was a good movie I also liked this prequel movie which I first saw on TV. I actually like this more than the Christina Ricci movie, It is a cute movie and stars two of my favorite actors Steve Guttenburg, and Lori Loughlin and I really didn't find this movie to be disappointing at all. It is totally cute and charming!"
1,A Stupid Begining,"To start out with, this is another one of those typical, cheap, grownups-are-stupid; kids-are-smart movies. This is nothing like the first movie. If this is how it all began then it does not tie in with the feature film Casper the Friendly Ghost.How can a ten-year-old boy, who is in the 4th grade, be smarter than his 40-year-old-dad, who is a successful architect? What happened to Casper's father, who lived in a completely other part of the country, and the big scary mansion? It doesn't make any sense. This is a disgrace to the friendly phantom.The acting in this movie is at an all time low. They got low paid actors for a low paid movie. All of the horrible acting, sets, story, and CG make this movie the definition of a terrible movie. Should you watch this junk you will discover the dreadfulness of this piece of trash."
3,Digestive progressive,"Effectively employing slight complexities to sometimes engaging melodic rock makes this prog-light outfit work, if not require seeking."
3,Unfortunately you're better off watching real surfers at the beach,"It's ok but you learn just as much by going to the beach and observing surfers out there. The main part that I learned was how to sit on your board and how to turn quickly to catch a wave. That part is hard to see from the beach. However, the ""pop up"" is easier to watch actually surfers do it."
4,Flower Fairies Alphabet,This has all the pictures I remember from 30-40 years ago. It's a gift for my granddaughter and I'm sure she'll love it as much as my daughter did.
1,Horribly unscientific,"Pardon the nearly identical review; however, this book suffers the same faults as every other AAT/H book/pamphlet written by Ms. Morgan. Every piece of literature from Ms. Morgan regarding AAT/H is horribly inaccurate, in conflict with reality and contains information that not only is flat-out wrong, but was known to be wrong decades before her books have been published, and pointed out as factually incorrect to Ms. Morgan many, many times. In addition, her citations and quotations are incomplete, altered and often prove the exact opposite of what she claims them to support. Regarding AAT/H she is either one of the most incompetent or one of the most intellectually dishonest researchers out there."
4,A very different view from the traditional.,"The book is arguing that humans, in their course of evolution, had an aquatic stage. It gives many lines of evidence that are in favor of this happening, and even if this didnt' happen it is still very interesting. Well written. It seems a little biased in her view, however, but still an enjoyable read for anyone interested in human evolution."
4,A Bloody Genealogy of Outlawry,"Sometime-journalist, sometime-novelist Wellman's history of bad guys who terrorized the American Wild West from the period following the Civil War to the early half of the 20th Century is excellently written and presented. He very interestingly traces the links -- sometimes by blood, sometimes by mere acquaintance or ""apprenticeship"" -- between the most infamous Western bad guys from William Clark Quantrill during the Bloody Kansas period preceding the Civil War to the death of Pretty Boy Floyd. Highly recommended to fans of Western fiction and general readers who want to know more about Western history."
2,Interesting review of western 'badmen',"While the book contains very interesting material regarding the roots of western outlaws in the years after the Civil War, some individual facts leave a bit to be desired. All in all a good read, but I would encourage further reading on some subjects, or at least double-checking some of the facts used in the book."
4,Very helpful tool,I enjoy looking through the book and getting ideas. I'm looking forward to using it in my next project.
3,Good toy,"My daughter received this a few years back for the holidays. Although she doesn't use it as much, it's still on her shelf and it still works. Requires a good amount of cranking to properly light a dark room but overall, it's a decent toy. No batteries makes it even better."
5,Jorge Federico Osorio: excelente visión de Chávez,"El Concierto para piano y orquesta de Carlos Chávez se sitúa como uno de los más importantes en el repertorio pianístico mexicano. (Otros ejemplos: el de Ponce, el de Rolón, el de Castro, etc.) Jorge Federico Osorio logra mantener en todo momento una visión acertada de la obra, reuniendo de este modo la más coherente interpretación que haya escuchado en disco (checar también la de María Teresa Rodríguez). El Concierto para violín y orquesta, con Pablo Roberto Diemecke es, desafortunadamente, débil en comparación con la calidad artística de Osorio."
4,Good part,"Bought an ACT flywheel, installition was easy, and simply now my little suby gets off the line like stig! Yay"
1,Please don't buy this toy for your tot!,"I TOTALLY agree with many of the other reviewers, but I thought I would type yet another bad review to make the point very clear! My MIL bought this for our son for xmas and we were shocked at the rude voice and comments (""Outta the way!"" ""Fill-er up!"") WHO wants their child to learn to speak that way or worse yet, start speaking that way after playing with a toy you purchased! Sorry, v-tech, we're usually fans of your products, but this toy went right in the TRASH - it didn't even make the bag for donation, I wouldn't want ANYONE'S kids to have it! Save your money and buy another driving toy - we just did!"
2,"Fun for kids, but rude","My daughter loves this toy, as she loves to pretend to drive, but we are really disappointed in what the toy says. The voice is bratty and gives bratty commands like ""Fill me up now""....no please/thank you etc. Also, on one it says ""Slow down little fellow"", and given that I have a girl playing with it, that could get confusing...I would like for toys to think a little more about how we would like our children to act instead of trying to get them to be rude and demanding."
3,It's an Okay toy,"I thought my son would like, but he does not seem interested after a few pull on the wheel - The sound is a bit annoying and very rude. I am glad he does not like it that much and won't pick up those rude remarks - like ""get out of the way!"" when the honk is pressed. I recommend you searched for another toy that has more educational value and more fun."
2,"Kids Love It, I Hate It","It's loud, it teaches terrible manners, and it's not educational. But it let's the baby pretend to drive and has some unique and child-appealing sounds and interesting levers and buttons for fine motor skills, so she loves it. I suspect I will have to get rid of it when she starts realizing it says rude things like ""Get out the way!!"" and the voices are really, really annoying."
2,Sound went crazy within 12 months & rude/aggressive phrases,"We bought this for our son as an infant. It was a lot of fun for him to mess with and hear different sounds etc...The sound went crazy within 12 months (if not before) and was not fixable.Also, the voice overs of the kids (phrases) were not a good example of what you want your kids saying. Quite shocked that this was considered acceptable to the Manufacturers. Had I have listened to this prior to purchasing I would have thought twice!I would not recommend this for kids who pick things (sayings) up quickly."
3,Just an ok toy,"My son played with this toy when he was sitting in his high chair. He liked moving the green stickshift and the wheel. It seemed like once he figured out how to do everything though, he lost interest (9mo).I was annoyed at the sexist comment in one of the songs....it says ""slow down little fella."" In my own opinion, it shouldn't only be a boy's toy, but I guess the VTECH people thought otherwise.Bottom line = Disappointed. Wouldn't recommend purchasing with all the other options out there."
4,Driving Fun,"My son (now 15 months) really enjoys this toy. He says ""Bye-Bye"" to the people in the car when they say ""Bye-Bye"" He loves the horn and making the car ""accelerate"" using the gear shift. My only quibble with this toy is that it is a little ""sexist."" It assumes that a boy only will play with it since one of it's phrases is ""Slow down little fella."" (This happens when the ""police car"" button is pressed. That I really don't want my son to blow the horn and hear ""Out of the way!"" All in all though he enjoys the toy and it is surviving his attention."
3,Need MoreVocals,"Every other cut is an instrumental. I bought this for my kids since they no longer learn these songs in school. While the words to ""Dixie"", for example, pop into my mind as I listen to the instrumental, the kids have never even heard of the song. I'm looking for a CD from which they can learn the lyrics.Otherwise, the CD is fine in a old banjo, fiddle, steel guitar style."
4,BROCCOLI TAPES,THIS BOOK IS ABOUT A GIRL NAME SARA.HER PARENTS WANTS TO MOVE FROM BOSTON TO HAWAII AND THEY THINK SHE WOULD LIKE HAWAII ALOT.SHE DOESN'T WANTS TO MOVE BECAUSE SHE IS GOING TO MISS HER FRIENDS IN BOSTON.SHE ALSO HAS A YOUNGER BROTHER.THEY BEEN LIVING IN HAWAII FOR 5 MONTHS AND SHE REALLY LIKES IT NOW. SHE HAS 2 BEST FRIENDS. ONE OF HER FRIENDS IS TAPE RECORDER THAT MAKES UP HER DAIRY. AND THE OTHER ONE IS A BLACK CAT THAT HER AND HER BROTHER FOUND.SHE SENDS HER TAPES TO HER FRIENDS IN BOSTON SO THEY CAN KNOW HOW SHE IS DOING AND WHAT SHE IS DOING.
1,Boooring.,I have read more than my share of critically aclaimed long novels that other readers give up on and I usually love them. This one is not all that long but after 150 pages it sure felt like it. Tossed it in the trash in the Atlanta airport and stared at the wall instead. Less tedious that way.
2,Not worth much of your time.....,"I read Panama for my high school book club, and frankly found it quite short of my expectations. The writing is very hard to follow sometimes. Zencey goes into these philosophical musings that seem to have very little to do with the subject at hand. Also, the female characters are very poorly drawn. It's hard to see why the main character Henry goes chasing after a woman he only saw twice, and when there also seemed to be little affection or attraction between them. The end is very unsatisfactory - anti climactic in a way. In all, the novel fails to really draw me in, and is not very satisfactorily written. If you are really looking for a good historical mystery, you'd be better off reading something by Ellis Peters or Glen Davis Gold."
2,Disappointing,As a big fan of historical novels I started this book with excitement. I very quickly became bored and found myself seeing how many more pages were left so I could start reading a different book. I'm not sure what the expert reviewers were thinking about when they gave this novel such high praise.
2,NILE RULE! NILE RULE...,"Errr, NOT really, haa! I mean these guys are OK! I really agree with Cemetary E... & Infernal_RItual on their bashing reviews. I definitely think that nile (their name doesn't deserve to be capitolized!) are OverRateD! Come-on, folks, they're not that good! Gee, calm down here, will ya! I know all ov u are going to check *NO* next to me review, but I don't care! Go ahead! U peons! Trendies! If it makes any ov u feel better, I do think the guitars on here sound quite GooD! Be on the look our for Incantation's latest monsterpiece (hopefully!) Infernal Storm! Argghhh! NOW Go and listen to nile like little boys and grrrlllsss..LAterz!"
4,Brutal Egypt,"When I first heard the war march intro to the song ""Ramses Bringer of War,"" I knew that I had bought an excellent album. Compared to Nile's later releases, Amongst . . is a lot more brutal, but at the same time, they still incorporate the Egyptian theme into the music. I do hear from some people that Nile is not brutal enough. Just listen to The Howling of the Jinn or Barra Edinazzu, and tell me that it's not brutal.Frankly, I don't see why this band gets criticized so much. Every metal fan should own this CD. It's a defianate death metal classic."
3,"Iconoclastic, but not necessarily objective","The author has attempted here to put American history in its true perspective (whatever that may mean). He successfully reports SOME of the differences between then and now, but his manipulation of the facts didn't convince me that we've got it better now than before. I grew up in the 50s and indeed DO remember simpler times. While Finkelstein laments our ""limited choices"" back then, and ""black-and-white"" television (oh, POOR US!) he fails to mention that our 'limited' choices were far more than previous generations had. Granted, we have more conveniences now than previously (COLOR t.v.---one-fourth the size of a small room wall, even!!), but we have over-crowded living conditions, deplorably crowded freeways, unbelievably high insurance rates for medical care, and, of course, the threat of nuclear disaster STILL is having over our heads. So, we are living longer? GOOD! But keep in mind that living longer has it's own set of problems. A so-so book."
2,Merely events of his daily life...,"I am a huge Og Mandino fan,but I did not find this book as great a writing as his others! I realize that this is an auto-biography, but I didn't think that it was written with the hope, joy, and courage so many of his other books seem to offer the reader. I was a little bored by the many insignificant details of his day-to-day activities. I assume this book's intention was to let the reader get to know Og Mandino on a more personal level, but as for myself- I have come to know Og on a more personal basis by reading his other books that have offered me principles with which could help me live a better life and that is what helped me to get to know him at a more intimate level."
5,Mislabeled Comedy,"This touching movie, set in a fictitious Arizona town, has been officially labeled a ""comedy"" by the studio. Indeed, Tim Roth's portrayal of the non-committal boyfriend has its grin-grabbing moments: ""Ya looking or buying?""However, this story is much more dramatic than anything comedic. I've seen the movie more than a dozen times and am always drawn to Fonda's loneliness, Roth's apathy, Stoltz's self-assurance, and Cate's empathy.Coupled with a deeply emotional soundtrack, ""Bodies, Rest and Motion"" is a MUST HAVE. It's about time (10 years) this movie was sent to DVD!But, when the studio says that these characters are ""hilariously intertwined,"" don't believe it!"
1,JUNK!!! DO NOT BUY!!!,"After spending nearly $1000 in the original purchase, installation, and repairs, I've decided to cut my losses and trash this dishwasher. Bought this product (or a similar one in this product line) 2 years ago. The user interface broke after only a year (but outside the warranty period). Without the user interface (the buttons used to run the thing), the entire dishwasher isn't of much good to you. After spending $230 on labor and a new user interface panel, the same part broke again after only about 5 months (again, outside the 90 day part warranty). Do NOT buy this product!!! I have always been a fan of Frigidaire for having economical prices and seemingly strong products, but this is the worse product from them I have ever bought, and I may never buy anything involving the Electrolux name (the true brand behind Frigidaire) again! For $1000, I could've easily bought a Bosch, and I will next time before wasting money on Frigidaire!"
4,"Good, but confusing","I ordered ""Island of Saints"", and ""Heart Mender"" and found out they are the same w/ name change. Could have returned""Island of Saints"", but lost the window of time. Great story, but did not need two of the same story. Wish I had known before I ordered. FYI to anyone who follows Andy Andrews."
5,Not your typical Western,"I loved this great spoof of the typical Western genre. Everything was played over-the-top. Every time I watch it I pick up some new detail that I had missed previously, some very subtle. All the actors must have had a ball making this. I particularly enjoyed watching Clint Walker play comedy in the scenes with his ""wife."""
3,Best of its genre,"I watched all the WWII and nazi-related movies and miniseries from the 1980s and I must say this one has stuck with me ever since. Derek Jakobi's performance of Hitler is spellbinding. The scene of him practicing his gestures before a mirror is compelling. Hauer gives a competant though understated performance as Speer. But I must tell you if you watch this movies for no other reason it is the lengthy scene, without dialogue, of Hitler walking through the rooms of the new reich chancellory. The haunting soundtrack music and Jakobi's eyes as he takes in Speer's handiwork are memorable and at the end of the scene, with tears he looks at Speer and say ""Well done."" When I watch that scene, ever 20 years later, it still gives me goosebumps. This two-part movie is definitely a cut above others from the era. Well worth it to watch."
2,Inside The Third Reich,"This has got to be the worst movie on the Third Reich. Dates were wrong, the screenplay was horrible. It was funny that in almost every scene in the movies from the 30's until 45 Himmler,Goering were always there, when in real life they were off doing there own things. Randy Quaid playing Ernst Hanfstaengl that was real bad. The uniforms had the wrong insignia and rank and everything was just a mess. Also you can tell that the whole movie was filmed in th fall and mostly winter. There are many scenes that add to this, such as when Hess flew to Scotland in the movie it was snowing in real life it was May and hot. Also when the attempt on Hitlers life on July 20th everyone is wearing winter clothing and there is snow outside. If Speer wouldn't died before 81 this movie sure would of done the job."
2,Highly Disappointing,"Don't get me wrong, Josh Freese is a fantastic drummer. But that's all that he should do. His meager songwriting skills were first evidenced in Euro-barge by the Vandals (""I am the ambassador of f-in kick your assador""? Give me a break). 'The Notorious One Man Orgy' is more of the same. True, Playboy Mansion is fun to listen to, Men & Women is alright, but the rest of the album borders on straight up stupidity. Lyrics seem like an amateur attempt at the style of humor that the Vandals did so well up through 'Hitler Bad, Vandals Good', guitar is overly simple power-chords (the kind of simple that screams 'I can't play anything else' not 'I'm really good but choose to play simply') with a little help from Warren Fitzgerald, and even the drums don't seem to measure up to his playing with other groups. Overall, I found this album very disappointing, especially because his work with the Vandals has been so excellent."
2,Poor quality,"As other reviewer notes: the image quality is awful on Joyless Street, so dark that many shots are illegible, and the music is completely inappropriate (cheerful Mozart over grim Weimar streets??)."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I like offbeat films, but this one is vastly over-rated. Any comedy in this movie is swallowed by the tragedy. Could barely stand to finish it. Stick with Waking Ned Devine."
1,WAY overrated & hugely disappointing,"We bought this movie after reading all the glowing reviews, and wonder now if the reviewers were actually referring to the same movie! We found ""The Snapper"" a major disappointment, and actually threw it away after watching it once. We'd never want to sit through it again, nor would we recommend it to anyone, so we just pitched it. It took us two sittings just to get through the movie at all -- we all fell asleep about halfway through the first time. Yes, it was heartwarming that the family stuck together and celebrated this new little life, but so what? None of the characters made us care about them particularly, as they showed little depth. The girl's father was implausibly supportive, her mother was strange, the baby's father was totally disgusting, and the girl was just plain silly and stupid. From now on, we'll go back to renting before buying. This was a total waste of time and money."
3,if u ar a college student study at CAL? I ll not recommend this book,"First for all, I like this book. It s easy to read but not a good tool for understanding whole calculus concepts. For me, it is kind of book good for a high school student having AP math. For a real college student, it is not enough.Second, if u dont get a good score at pre calculus, It can help u a lot by transferring to calculus level at the very beginning.Last, I dont know wat math level u need to be, it only covered 2/3 part of calculus one(&#8544;) for college. And it has a long distance to get upper B+ for calculus with this book."
4,Easy fast read.,"Although the book does not cover every subject that you will encounter in calc I and II, it does cover the basics and gives great examples of real world applications. The flow of the book is nice which makes it easy and fast to read. I like the Preface which states that ""we should skip the preface because we're doing math"". Works good as a reference and can not beat the price.A"
2,"Too pokey, hard, awkward","This thing is too awkward for me. Maybe if you're a big buff guy it might be ok, but I'm a kinda skinny girl, and it just sort of hurts. I wish I had gotten the regular ball and not the peanut shape. It just doesn't work like you think it would."
2,Just an overview,"This book is a well-written, great introduction to Win2K. HOWEVER, it is of little help to experienced NT users looking for ANY technical detail about Win2K. I am sorry I bought it without more thoroughly examining it. I (and many other people, I believe) really need much more detail."
3,Nice source for getting knowledge not as a study source,"I bought this book to keep it as a source to depend on when needed, when it was time to use with reading for the MCSE windows 2000 pro exam I did help me to answer some questions that I couldnt found answers for them in the training kit.This book takes u from the basic level up to higher levels of knowledge.In brief good for real problems not so good as a study material."
2,Mastering user side or admin side??,"I bought the entire Mastering Win 2000 Ressource kit in order to prepare for my Win 2K MCSE but when I when throught the table of content and the first half of the book in found myself back in kindergarden with a babysister. this book is almost no use for the Win 2K exam but I think I would good for somebody with little or no Win2K experience. It is more from a user or would be power user point of view not at all from a system admin side. this book will not help you master Win2K with topics like send email with outlook express, use Win2k multimedia capacities and else"
4,Interesting Film - But Forget The Dubbing,"I'll spare you the synopsis and theological opinion and just say that I thought this was a very good film (though not for everyone). The cimematography was great, especially the beach scenes. One comment on this edition (Criterion): Do NOT watch the dubbed version first. I made this mistake. The voices are SO BAD that you lose the entire feel of the characters. They almost become parodies of themselves and the power of the movie is lost. Stick with the subtitles and enjoy the film."
1,Welllll....,"I have to say I did not enjoy this film at all. I wanted to like it, knew some about it beforehand, but still could not get into it. It seemed to be something to be endured rather than appreciated. 95% my collection is foreign language, so that wasn't a factor. Even if you favor odd, eclectic, avant-garde films, I urge you to rent before buying ""The Seventh Seal.""Kudos as usual to Criterion for their fine treatment of this film; I just wish I had cared."
2,Overrated,"The Seventh Seal put me to sleep. I guess Woody Allen saw this one fifty times and the critics thought it was deep man, but I had a hard time keeping my lids from falling. Here is a recreation of medieval life, but then it's trivialized by clumsy visual comedy, a poor man's Midsummer Night's Dream. Shakespeare isn't worried. The theme: is there a God or isn't there: redundant. I liked the Death Man. The movie was better when his black robes were on screen."
2,"As I watched this film, I thought I","was watching a comedy movie. As a previous poster wrote, the acting is poor along with a very uneven plot indeed. We start with Max von Sydow at the Swedish seashore with his squire about to play chess with Death. Just as they sit down, it moves to a completely different scene. We do not pick up Death or the chess match for a while. I have respect for Bergman, but this movie is very poor indeed. I would expect better from the man. The ending is comical as though watching a John Ford pumper as in ""Young Mr Lincoln"" where Fonda is walking up a hill with thunder and lightening going on to end the film."
2,Kind of pointless.,"'The Seventh Seal' was mostly pointless and boring. It has a great reputation in the film community, but there is nothing to get excited about. I think the director was trying to make something profound, but it just ended up being lame. The chess game death is playing with the guy throughout the movie is cheeesy. The last scene looks pretty cool, but doesn't make any sense. See it for curiosity."
1,The Seventh Seal - Criterion Collection,Just aweful! Can't figure out why it's so much talked about! Boring and stifled and far too slow!!
5,One of the best films ever made.,This movie is a masterpiece of cinematography. While watching this movie hit the pause button at any time and you will have a beautifully composed still photograph. I can't help but think that each frame of this movie is a well thought out still photo put together to creae a brilliant movie. A must have for any serious movie collector.
5,The Seventh Seal,I love ALL works by Ingmar Bergman. This film has been a favorite of mine for over 30 years!!! TTD
5,I LOVE IT!!!!!!!,"This book is amazing. I used for the USMLE Step 2 CK and get a 220. I used with the First Aid, because this book has different information than the FA. I highly recomend to read chapter 29-34 a couple of time they are very helpful.Good Luck!!!!!"
4,Very good review - gets most of what you need...,"This is a well-written text with valuable, pertinent sections. Brochert includes a good balance of high-yield sections + explanations, which allows you to avoid repetitively memorizing facts. If you couple this with QBank, and then add a book or two on your weaker sections, I think you'll do well. Cons? I thought the surgery section was a bit lacking, as you'll see a number of abdominal complaints on the Boards that are glossed over in this book. But the stronger sections more than make up for it. Highly recommended.. if you can read it 312 times back-to-back like some of these speed-readers, good for you. If you're like everyone else, having a good knowledge of the info inside will go a long way. Good luck."
3,ONE THAT YOU WILL WANT TO READ,"ICED takes place in Missoula Montana, where Meg Gardner an ex- con turned repo woman, is trying to get her life together. Meg has to repo a jeep belonging to Clay Bennett, the same Clay Bennett that was just found dead. Meg figures that it will be easy to get the jeep back, but once she has it back the trouble starts. Someone else wants the jeep, next thing you know Meg is drawn into a murder mystery involving sex and violence. As Meg tries to solve the mystery she must deal with her own ghosts from her past as well as deal with Russian thugs and Tina Red Dear, a Native American woman who could very well be her half sister. I thought that ICED was well written but left me with to many unanswered questions about Megs past. The mystery involving Clay Bennett was top-notch with plenty of suspense. Meg is a protagonist that really wants to be left alone to live her life low- key with coffee, cigarettes, beer, and burgers in that order."
2,Pretzels Anyone?,"I have purchased Peanut Lovers Chex Mix from Amazon for 2 years. Normally the product is great but this last shipment was not. Over half of each package (in a box of 12) were pretzels - this has never happened and I hope the next box does not follow suit.Chex Snack Mix Peanut Lovers, 8.75-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)"
3,"Good, but I prefer Emer Kenny in this genre","Several people made alot of hype about this and although I had a general idea of what the style might be I felt just a little mislead. I guess I expected this album to be more ambient and deeply mystical. The paper cover on the cd compares it to Andreas Vollenweider crossed with Enigma, and while I do see some similarities to Andreas, I don't see how it bears any resemblences to Enigma - maybe that was just placed on there to draw people to it - but the reason I actually bought this cd was because I was under the impression that it was more of a Celtic harp style mixed with trip-hop beats. It's basically just new-age harp music with some ambient rhythms, not bad, but nothing outstanding either.If anything, I actually prefer the sound of Emer Kenny, and I reccomend anyone who likes ""Moai"" to check her out, similar rhythms and harp playing, but Emer Kenny is more Celtic with ambient pop rhythms and an overall deeper and more sensual sound than Monica Ramos."
5,Wow!,"Andreas Vollenweider meets Enigma. That was the description at the music store, but the music is a lot more than that. It is romantic and sensual, yet also quite relaxing. I don't have the words to describe it, really... but it'd make a good honeymoon gift ;)"
2,Huge Disappointment!!!,"REVIEWER: E-DogI played the first two Harry Potter games for PS2 and loved them! I borrowed this one and was very disappointed. The game is boring and hard. Sure, the graphics are good but I hated the game. It was hard to beat the tasks. Like the first one, the game got harder as you got further into the game. I liked the second one most because it was hard but it didn't get super hard. I wish it was at least a bit more like the second one. Definitely play the Game Boy Advance version or borrow this one first."
1,... um,"It seems these guys are out to mimic Napalm Death and the only thing they picked up on was the 20 second song concept. Not only are they ripping off Napalm Death, they are doing it horribly. Every song sounds the same, there is absolutely no creativity going on in the song writing process. Listen to something with talent, there is none here."
5,Review for Oxo Good Grips Roller Mop Refill,"It arrived very very quickly and in a rather unique fashion (in a good way). The small mop refill came in a rather huge box and made me wonder if I had ordered the wrong thing. Upon opening the box, I found everything intact and in perfect shape. There was no defect of any sort."
1,Flimsy - breaks easily,"The mop started popping out the housing on the first use. After a few uses, the handle came apart and I cannot pull the lever to rinse out the mop. Save your money!!!"
3,"OK, but too much filler!","I just finished the Orchid Theif by Susan Orlean. I really enjoyed the book, being a new hobbiest in orchids, it was entertaining and informative. The biggest problem I have with the book is the amount of details she gave that really did't matter. I was so tempted to go through the book again and count how many times she mentioned ""it takes seven years for an orchid to mature."" It was annoying to say the least. Loved all the history on orchids and Florida, but the filler is sometimes very boring."
4,A fascinating look at obsession.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and I have never had the slightest interest in orchids. It actually reminded me a lot of Tony Horwitz's Pulitzer-Prize-winning ""Confederates in the Attic."" Just replace the male journalist with a female journalist, and trade out Civil War fanatics with orchid fanatics. Both books offer fascinating glimpses into lives of people who fully entrench themselves into their interests interwoven with solid research."
4,my life,excellent movie- michael keaton is in best form!! i am not a n. kidman fan- but she does a good job here.
5,Deserves more attention,"A very moving film. I'm guessing that maybe it didn't get the attention it deserved because it was labeled too sentimental and mawkish-- but there's nothing wrong with ""tear-jerker"" elements that support a bigger point in the story. They do in My Life... and what point could possibly be bigger than ""what makes life worth living?"" (the focus of the film).I agree with 97 percent of comments here on performance. The only thing that I would emphasize is that there are just superb performances by Michael Constantine, Rebecca Schull and Bradley Whitford as the disowned blood relatives. (Without giving up too much, I will say that Constantine's ""better late than never"" line put this reviewer down for the count!)Wonderful film."
4,Good One,I actually was forced to watch this for a class assignment. I bought it for my kindle so I could watch it on my to Louisiana for a family trip. It actually turned out to be a very interesting and informative documentary.
5,An excellent synopsis of the Enron scandal,"I didn't fully understand how Enron had ""cooked its books"" prior to watching this film. The director makes what could be a boring financial story VERRY interesting! The music and the use of images in the film is EXCELLENT and really gets the point across. I watched it three times, and I almost never do that with any movie. It grabs you!"
4,Enron - The Smartest Guys in the Room,"Good story for both Corporate types and the layperson. I didn't read the book since watching the DVD is easier for me. If you are wondering what this Enron thing is all about, get this DVD."
4,Documentary ENRON,At first I thought this was going to be an actual movie with a plot and all that good stuff. Turns out it is a documentary. I learned alot! I had no idea that ENRON was such scum of the Earth. It sounds to me like ENRON is to blame for the recession we're in. Go figure. I approve of this documentary.Daniel
4,"Good, but surprising","Good portrayal of a big business going bad as the corruption grew bigger and bigger.Surprisingly (maybe i missed it), I don't remember Rebecca Mark even being mentioned once throughout the entire program."
4,"Worth seeing, and sharing with a friend.","This is a smart and well-paced look both in front of, and behind, the scene to explain what happened with Enron, and how things went so wrong. I highly recommend it to people who want to understand the perils of deregulation of energy markets, and more broadly about how private incentives for capitalists can be so at odds with the public interest. The simple explanation of how California taxpayers were left tens of billions of dollars in the hole because of flawed deregulation and price manipulation is priceless."
3,Sixth Grade Can Really Kill You,"I understand and can sympathize with Helen and her reading challenges. I am glad that she found a constructive solution. I found it frustrating (and socially irresponsible) that Helen was able to launch firecrackers in school, intentionally damage a teachers' clothing and spray paint the school main entrance signage with little repurcussion. In today's schools, those types of actions would warrant serious consequences."
5,Well Written and Helpful,"Brodow provides a very useful summary for those needing to negotiate - eg. for a raise, starting salary, buying or selling a house or car, etc. Overall suggestions are made (eg. the most important trait is listening, with the ability to ask good open-ended questions also important; be willing to walk away; have a pre-thought minimum acceptable, target, and high target prior to beginning), followed by specific suggestions for certain situations and involving specific personalities.I would suggest giving the book a quick read, then keeping it handy to refer to in future negotiations."
1,Mounnting plate,This plastic piece of junk does not fit the Martin House or the pole. COMPLETELY USELESS. I will not be fooled again by their false advertising.
1,Heath Outdoor BP-15 Mounting Plate,Wrong product for john deere purple martin box I ordered. Returned it. No problem with return however. That's one main reason I order so much from Amazon.com. Return policy is great.
5,Mounting Plate Review,I like the plate. I fabricated my Martin house from scratch about 15 years ago. I was never happy with my version of a mounting plate. This one is light and perfectly suited for my house. It works!!
4,The second great Incantation album,"This band is like the metal underground a paradox: brilliant when at top of form, and listless when not. By my reckoning, they've put out one genius work, ""Onward to Golgotha,"" several excellent live albums and compilations including ""Forsaken Mourning of Angelic Anguish,"" and one solidly excellent but not over-the-top-genre-redefining work, ""Diabolical Conquest.""I like this album. Every song has a collection of solid riffs and some artistic mechanism at its center, whether deliberate or not. Further, there is some experimentation with ambient dissonance on later tracks, and a tendency to seek a higher degree of discernible melody in the context of storytelling songs with consistent punch but not repetitive loops of emotional or musical statements. If you enjoy the roaring extremity of this band, purchase this after ""Onward to Golgotha"" and it will rapidly lay claim to space in your CD rack."
4,WE WILL ETERNALLY LIVE IN SO-CALLED FORSAKEN DAMNATION,"This is more ""evil"" than most trendy black metal bands could ever hope to be. Everything from the artwork to the lyrics to the music itself shows how passionate these guys are about their cause. They're not just some nobody's using a satanic image to sell more records, they mean it all, and it shows. Very powerful, doomy death metal. Far superior to the legions of uninspired bands. My favorite tracks are Desecration(of the heavenly graceful), Unheavenly Skies, and Ethereal Misery. The drumming is very solid, with atleast a little variation between blast beats. I don't remember there being any solos on the entire album,but the riffs are good, and create a feeling of impending doom."
3,Disappointed.,"I was disappointed in the quality of this whisk! For starters, it is rather flimsy when stirring thicker concoctions. Secondly, the wires are so close together where it meets the rest of the handle that if food gets stuck in there and dries even slightly, it will take a knife to dislodge it...I spent 10 minutes trying to get slightly dried gravy out of it even after a good 15 minute soaking! It also won't get into the space where sidewall of the pan meets the bottom, so be prepared for stuck on food in those spaces, depending on the design of your cookware.Next time I will get a solid stainless steel whisk, not one with a ""grippy"" handle."
3,Throw-away Elvis CD,I believe this may have been orignally one of the Colonels' budget albums. I bought it because I needed a few more dollars for free shipping and I think it was marked down to $5. I love Elvis music but wouldn't recommend this to anyone. There's much better ways to enjoy Elvis' music than buying this CD.
1,It Tore Apart 5 days from receivng it!,"Nothing else to say. Two days later, the lid first came off. I tried to glue it it but ist stopped working..."
3,leadbetter golf swing,"too long, not to the point. kind of old dated including all the cloths. more computer graphic will help. Too much talking and not enough action. don't like his british accent neither. Leadbetter never demonstrated a swing. why we want to see some random people's less than perfect swing."
5,great book,bought the book for the wife and she loved it - a lot of great reading and helps throughout its pages.
3,Let's start with the basics,"First book of it's kind I have read or purchased. I am looking to perhaps start a collection and wanted to know where to begin and what type I should be on the look out for.Perhaps there are better out there, I left feeling that much more research was necessary and would have liked it to be a bit more complete."
2,It doesn't smell like the first one I got.,"It doesn't smell like the first one i got.It smell different, the first one I got in chula vista store smell better, I don't know why, the package is the same....but smell different, I have the first bottle and I can compare...Please Amazon ask your supplyer...Was a valentine's gift for my wife, and she open it a month after that day, so I can't sent it back. Is a shame, I love this fragance.I will buy it again in the store."
2,I love love.... not really,"It is an ok perfume. I smelt it and bought it but it is not my favorite. I got tired of it really fast, specially since it doesn't seem to be very unique. Smells too much like light blue, which I hate. Try Live in Love by Oscar de la Renta, it is a far better buy and smell."
5,Beautiful for meditation,"This CD is one of the best meditation CD's I have...the melodies are flawless, It is perfect for connecting to your spiritual side. There is a calming affect as soon as you listen and you feel connected to God...Love It"
4,Cute and Clever,"This is the first Jennifer Weiner book that I've read - I thought it was really cute and clever with some really funny parts. The character ""Becky"" was especially hysterical. Since I don't have kids, I probably didn't appreciate the story as much as someone who's actually been a ""new mom"" --- But I still thought it was a really fun book. And based on this novel, I'm looking forward to reading another J. Weiner book soon."
5,A must read for all new Moms! Excellent!,"A female physician that I work with told me to read this book and didn't really give me too many of the details prior. Jennifer Weiner has since become one of my favorite authors because so much of what she writes speaks directly to me. I have a 20 month old son and as I read Little Earthquakes, I could see so much of myself in each of the 4 main characters who are also going through Motherhood. The experiences that the women have are so true to what Motherhood has brought me, both funny and not so funny.I recommended this book to all of my Mommy friends and am so glad my co-worker introduced me to this author. I am now reading another one of her books and it is fabulous!"
1,"If you are past childbearing years, it is a must not read","I have read Good in Bed, and loved it, read In Her Shoes, and loved it, and totally thought that Little Earthquakes had to be written after Jennifer was in an earthquake and had brain damage. If I sound rude, I am not, I am just annoyed at the time spent waiting for her book to become less trite, less uninteresting, and less predictable. This is the first book that I actually threw away after I was done with it. I did not want to pass it on to anyone.The subject matter might be good for the generation having babies right now, but I am 44 and it bored me. I hope that Jennifer is not getting stale so soon. Don't waste your time."
5,Another winner from Jennifer Weiner,I've been waiting all year for LITTLE EARTHQUAKES and read it all last night. It's a great book that explains what having a baby does to a woman's life. GREAT STUFF.
5,"Perfect Book, Perfect Timing","I've been reading Jennifer W. for years and somehow never got around to this one. I've read every other one of her books and love most of them. This one had the most perfect timing because I have an 8 month old. I don't think I would have laughed and cried so hard a year ago before I became a mother. This book is full of hilarious parenting truisms, as well as heart-breaking ones. There was a little bit of me in the every one of these characters and I never cease to be amazed at how Jennifer W. can suck me in and keep me up at all hours of the night. This is not great for my already sleep deprived existence, but I enjoyed this book so much that it was totally worth it! Highly recommended to any new mother!"
1,Not What I Wanted to Read While Expecting,"I read this book two weeks before my due date. While perhaps the events are a sad part of life the last thing I needed to be reading about was how having a baby negatively effects your life and your relationship with your spouse. There was little emphasis on the positive.The fact that the main character's own child dies a tragic death at 10 weeks was sad to me. Having her stalk a pregnant woman and leave her mysterious gifts is creepy. The way that they became friends is completely unrealistic.Personally, I thought this book was entertaining in a mindless-fluff kind of way, but the characters and their relationships were too predictable, yet unbelievable."
5,A wonderful book that I couldn't put down,"I have read four of Jennifer Weiner's books now and I am always surprised by how much they captivate me. With Little Earthquakes, I literally could not put it down. I am a single women with no children and the stories of these four women really fascinated me even though I could not relate to their lives. I love her writing and find it refreshing amongst the multitude of ""chick lit"" writers. Little Earthquakes is one of Jennifer Weiner's best works."
3,I would buy this book in a heartbeat for all first time moms,"Ms. Weiner is a terrific author and I suspect a really nice person, judging from her website. This book resonates well with me as a mom. I preferred Good In Bed and In Her Shoes, thus the 3 star rating rather than 4 or 5. I've read all of Weiner's literary contributions and I look forward to the next."
3,Very good with fleeting moments of disappointment,"I almost gave it 4 stars, because truth be told, I could hardly put it down and finished it in two days (and I am the mother of an 18 month old.) However, there were just enough moments interspersed to make me say to myself ""oh, I wish she hadn't written that that way.""I lost a baby as a newborn, so the portions of the story dealing with Lia were mostly right on, but again, others seemed completely wrong to me (in particular her spending so much time with women with new babies...no grieving mother I know, and I know plenty, would ever, ever do that. It is far too excruciating.)I liked the characters, laughed out loud enough to plow through it and will read another by Weiner."
5,"honest, heartwarming, overall great book","I loved this book. Even though I don't have children of my own, I found the characters to be dynamic, funny and real-life. It was easy to identify with each of them on some level."
2,Dragged me back to some awful times,"Although I have loved some other titles by this author, I did not enjoy this book. I agree, its fairly well-written. However, the details of the agonizing days of dealing with a newborn are something I would like to forget. This book forces you to relive those awful moments (why won't my baby nurse? How can I avoid having post-baby sex? Will I ever get a full nights' sleep again? etc.) This might be a good book for someone who is closer to those days, but my kids are 10 and 14. I've moved on, happily."
3,Very Creaky,"I purchased this elliptical because it had the best price for an elliptical with the features I was looking for. The only problems I have with it are the amount of noise it produces when in use and a mild instability within the structure when going at a fast pace. Other than that, it's a great machine and produces a great and fun workout."
3,"runs small, don't believe the picture","Very nice fitted cap. Ordered XL, which fits me fine in all the other hats I wear, but this one is very tight. I'd almost think they mislabeled a large. The pictures shows a red cap, blue brim. Mine arrived solid red."
5,One great cap!,"I'm an old Brooklyn Dodgers fan but Boston's caps are close enough. These fit fine with wear and the price, before everyone else wanted one, was perfect! I'd order again in a minute!"
1,Very Unhappy with Functionality,"This bassinet looks great, but is totally unsafe. I wake up every night with my son having moved to the side of the bassinet with his face burried or almost burried in the side. We have the rocker locks on and they do not prevent the cradle from rocking at all, so when he is in there it tilts to either side with barely any force. I am very displeased that this expensive bassinet would have such a dangerous and faulty feature! My son is only 3 weeks old and almost manages to turn over on his own when he is in the bassinet. If you want the security of knowing your baby is safe while you sleep ... DON'T BUY THIS BASSINET!"
2,Not the best,As a new mom I wanted to have a pretty bassinett for my little girl. This one was just that...pretty. That's about it. The pad is very thin and there is only one sheet and it is not very soft. If you have a child like mine who spits up in the night you will be washing this everyday. I also had a problem with the bassinett rocking even when it was locked. My baby would end up smushed against the side if she moved even a little bit. Not only was that scary but she didn't get any solid sleep because everytime se rolled to the side it woke her up. We have since brought our pack and play upstairs for her to use instead and she loves it. Save your money.
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I bought this bassinet because I liked the way it looked. Like the other reviewers have said the music is HORRIBLE and yes, it rocks, as long as you are rocking it. Also, the matteress pad is VERY thin and standard bassinet pads do not fit in this bassinet.It is also very small. If you have a large baby, I don't think they will fit in it for 4 months.I had no problem ordering extra sheets from the company but really, it would be nice if they would include extra sheets with the bassinet from the beginning.With all that is wrong with this bassinet, I still like it well enough and kept it around for baby number 2."
3,not exactly what I expected,I recieved the bassinet for a shower gift and I have ro say i fell in love with it in the store. It is a veery cute looking bassinet but there were a couple things that worried me. The wheels do not snap in they just slide in so if there was alot ogf movement the wheels would come off. also i purchased some standard bassinet sheets which after laundering found out that they do not fit. The rocking mothion of the bed is a couple sways and then stops. And unfortunately the music sounds like a dying out music box. This may all sound harsh but if you can get past the music and find sheets that fit then go ahead but I suggest looking around first!
2,Eddie Bauer Bassinet,"I got this bassinet as a shower gift, and am I glad I did.My daughter loves sleeping in it and it's the right height for me to see her from my bed. She was born premature and has acid reflux which causes her to choke on spit up, so I like the fact I can roll it into whatever room I'm in to keep an eye on her.I would definitely recommend this one."
4,Nice....but no automatic rocking feature,"When we went shopping for bassinets, my husband and I fell head over heels for this one. I love the colors and the storage underneath is wonderful. However, this does not have an automatic rocking feature, which for some reason I thought it had. If I would have realized it before my baby shower I probably would have picked out a different bassinet. My 8 week old daughter falls asleep and stays asleep with a rocking motion, and I'm way too tired to rock her all night. Also, I don't use the music feature, so I can't comment on that."
1,Baby hates it,"We agree with the prior reviewers that this bassinet does not lock. If you have a wiggly baby, like ours, your baby will end up crammed against the side and screaming. We borrowed this bassinet from friends and their baby also refused to sleep in it."
1,Horrible bassinet. Please do not buy.,"The bassinet does not lock into place and my baby always rolls to one side and is flush against the side of the bassinet with her face against the padding. Due to gravity and her still being so small she is unable to push herself back. This scares me to death for fear that she will suffocate and as a result i am unable to sleep and constantly waking up to check on her. For first time moms, this bassinet looks nice but is extremely dangerous. Please do not buy it. You will regret it."
5,most feautiful sounds of christmas from the living strings,if this album is like the spirit of christmas whith the living strings label\album no.rca camden cas 783 then i give it a five star rating.
4,Oldy but Goody,"This a classic with great acting and some light nudity that was well before its time. Worth a watch or two just so you can brag about having seen it. Gene Hackman, Lee Marvin (at the top of their games) and a very young Sissy Spasick- need more be said?The Bobster"
2,Prime Dumb!!!,"I often ask myself how two really excellent actors in their prime would get committed to a project like ""Prime Cut"". You would be hard pressed to find a dumber story, plot line or set of characters. This is almost a purposeful testament to all that was worse with the 70's ""Lew Wasserman"" type production deals."
3,There must be something better?,"I have just begun my studies for the diaconate. I have great respect for Fr O'Meara, but his ability to pull together what he is writing about often left me questioning the use of this book in educating new diciples in Christ's mission. I found it to be one of the more difficut books I have ever read."
4,Simple and strong,"Pros:Made in USAGlass, so no lead in the glaze worries.Lightweight so they are not as hard on the cupboard or the dishwasher, and they are easy to pick up and carry around.Strong-does not chip easily.Microwave safe for reheating leftovers or a can of soup, right in the bowl.Decent size bowl with a nice wide rim that helps prevent sloshing over.Food looks nice in the clear glass.Con:A sticker on each bowl. It would be better not to have to scrape the stickers and glue off of each and every bowl. It's a pain.Other than wishing the bowls didn't have a sticker on each, I can't think of anything I do not like about these bowls."
3,Not Libbey,"This product is made in Mexico, and labeled Crissa (which is apparently Libbey's Mexican brand). Each item has a sticker I had to pick off, which was a pain. The bowls are fine, good size for soup."
3,hmmm,"First of all, Mormons are Christians a.k.a followers of Christ. Secondly and most important ""Utah Mormons"" are a culture and differ from most Mormon's. It is entirely too ignorant to judge/label someone as being something because they are a certain religion. As all religions it is a family and all members of that family are unique. As individuals we choose to do things from our perspective, even under a collective viewpoint we still have many varying degrees of actions, perceptions and feelings. I think this is a nice book, well written and interesting. However I think the viewpoint is skewed as it pertains to ""Utah Mormon's"" which do have a strong culture of their own. Personally I would not choose to approach someone's beliefs based on generalities. How about gaining your own perspective rather than taking someone's word for it?"
2,Mormons Already Believe in Jesus Christ and the Holy Bible,"I appreciate the good will involved in this book very much. But anyone who knows anything about the beliefs and doctrines of real Mormons - members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints - knows that they believe in Jesus Christ as the Savior of us all, and the Son of God, and trust in the Holy Bible as scripture. Our whole faith centers around Christ and His life and teachings, and His resurrection, and atonement for our sins and mistakes, and the knowledge that He will return someday. No one needs to introduce us to Christianity. We share that common faith with all other Christians. The Book of Mormon is a second witness, to go with the Holy Bible, that Jesus Christ lives and will return."
1,Book simply spreads wrong ideas on Latter-day Saints,"The idea that someone has to share Christ with a Latter-day Saint does nothing more than show the ignorance of the author. Latter-day Saints know Christ, love Christ, Worship Christ, and believe in the grace of Christ and his sacrifice. So-called Mormons, are, in fact Christians."
4,Black End Table,"This was nicer than what I thought it would be however, when I went to add the front door panel on, it cracked down the side. Luckily since it is black the crack does not stand out. Other than that, I am pleased with the way it looks."
3,Room for Improvement,"I bought these for my wife last week and they look great.The one problem I have with them is that some of the panels had some minor scuffing out of the box. Luckily it was on the underside of each panel, so it isn't noticeable. There was also an issue of the wood splitting on one of the screw holes, but it was very minor."
4,Better than expected based on negative reviews,"Despite mixed reviews, we ordered this anyway because it was the only black table we could find with a cabinet door. We put it together in 20 minutes with only a screwdriver. Quality of wood is not great, but for the price it suits our purpose. Only disappointed that the price has gone up since I bought it and now I am paying almost double for a second one."
1,Should not have gotten this,"Okay, well.. I don't usually review a lot of things on the ""I hate it"" level. But I do. This is a piece of crap. It immediately started to fall a part. I gave it to my niece and nephews for their tree house. I should have gone to a thrift shop or antique store and found me a real piece of furniture."
3,good night stand,"looks very good but its quality is not that good, but it is good enough compared to the price, which is 25$."
4,Easy To Put Together & Worth The Price!,I am really happy about the quality and how easy it was to put together. I was not expecting it to be as nice as it is for the low price. You cannot go wrong if you want an inexpensive but nice side table!
1,going back,Got the winsome night stand and it was good quality for price so thought this would be too. Wrong. Very cheap. Sides are cardboard and easily would break if a kid kicked them or someone walked into it. Shelf does not sit flat. Cabinet does not work properly. It is going back.
1,CHEAP JUNK,"This item is complete garbage. Arrived with a cracked leg in a perfect shipping box. Pieces were hard to put together, poor quality over-all I would NOT recommend this."
2,Poorly engineered,"I needed a powerful drill and screwdriver to construct this side table. The holes were not deep enough for the screws that were provided and so it took alot more effort to construct that what should have been necessary. Also, it looks pretty decent now, but it is still not as stable as I would like for it to be. I'm pretty disappointed in the product, but since I finally have it constructed, I'm not going to send it back. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
2,Works well for light use,"Bought this for our guest room. I wasn't expecting much for the price, and I certainly got what I paid for. It looks nice enough, the finish is a bit off on the front, there's a cloudy white haze over most of the door which won't polish off, but not a big deal. It is verrrry flimsy, I assembled it in our living room and was concerned it might fall to pieces when I carried it to the guest room (it didn't). Some of the holes are too shallow, and quite frankly I was afraid to take a drill to it. It looks nice in the room and while it isn't wobbly, you wouldn't want to put your weight on it or anything. It's holding an ihome, lamp, and a book or two without a problem and will work well for light use in our guest room. I would definitely look for something a little more solid if you need an end table for daily use. I did notice the gassy, chemical smell others have mentioned, my hands smelled of it after assembling."
2,ughhh,"I was very excited about the price for this item and the fact that it got here within two days of placing the order. However, I should have known something was up when I was only paying $40 for a ""wood"" nightstand. I bought two, and both of them are cracked completely at the legs. Since they are black its not terribly obvious, however, they are no longer structurally sound. They barely hold my lamp. I'd say, if you need something temporary & quickly, go for it. Otherwise, spend the extra $$$"
1,peices did not fir,"0 stars if possible. Furniture needs to be assembled. The two sides should be identical, but were a good 1/4 inch difference making it impossible to put together. Should come with a lathe or something."
4,Great for a small office,I have a small office area and this fits perfect as an end table. Great for the price
2,Terrible engineering,"It took me about 5 hours of work with a drill and special screws to put these nightstands together. The quality is super cheap, the holes for the screws that hold everything together are misplaced. Even if you get them to match (takes significant effort and strength), the holes for the screws are too close to the end of the planks and could end up puncturing the sides. Terrible engineering.After putting them together, they are OK. I use them for small things and haven't had a problem with anything. But it'll be easier to grab an axe, go to the woods, and make yourself a nightstand than put this together."
1,Poorly Made,"I should have listened to the other opinions on this product, but I thought they must have just had a bad experience, however was I wrong. Let alone the paint has already chipped off of the top within 2 days of putting together, some of the wood was discolored already. When screwing the screws in the nightstand, the cheap ""wood"" cracked and one of the screws that they provided for the knob was not even long enough to use it. I understand they were not $100 or $200 nightstands, however I thought they would at least due the trick in the meantime, but not fall apart within the first week. It comes down to the old saying, you get what you pay for and I would not recommend this to anyone, even if you are trying to save a buck or two, since it is not worth it and you will be replacing them."
4,It's cheap but good enough...other reviews are severe,It doesn't cost much and looks fine. I found some of the other reviews quite severe given the price point of the item. They look great in our extra bedroom and were very easy to put together. The only problem is that one of the two end tables came without hardware so I had to call the manufacturer. They sent it without a problem. My bigger challenge was Amazon customer service (such a shame given they're usually fabulous!) They said I'd have to return the whole end table and couldn't coordinate sending me the hardware. That would have been such a pain. They refused to call the manufacturer for me so I took care of it myself.
2,looks nice but...,"I bought this shelf for my bedside, putting it together was rather simple and it looks nice. However after about the first month the back fell apart and broke. Its still usable but only because I have yet to replace it. Also the bottom for the shelf always falls down in the back right hand corner :/"
2,CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP,"Not at all described. lightweight and poorly made, directions hard to follow, very very thin wood, I seriously doubt it will last more than a month. I am not at all happy with this product but it will cost more to ship it back than it will to keep it. I seriously doubt I will be buying one of these again."
4,end table,Just got the new couch and placed the end tables. I purchased matching boxes to put on the open shelf. They look great.
4,Solid purchase!,"This is a great little nightstand. its made of cheap materials but the pieces are fairly sturdy. i like it better than the recycled wooden stuff that most pieces these days are made of. It took about 15 minutes at most to put together and the directions were simple and easy to follow. In all i would recommend this purchase to anyone. My only negative is that i think nightstands should be cheaper than this but in comparison to the price of all nightstands in general this price is worth it. Four stars. Although it is a great little nightstand, i think it should be 35 dollars. that would be the perfect price for this."
5,Great Product,"This product was very economical and well worth the money. Just know that the entire item is not solid all the way around, the side panels are a plywood type material. However, it is sturdy and looks very nice in my in-home office."
3,Quick and easy table kit,We ordered 2 of these tables to use in the home theater. My 12-year-old grandson assembled them in about 30 minutes.They have proven to be satisfactory but we would have preferred a bit larger table for this use.Again Amazon delivered to our door in one day.
1,Total piece of crap,"I was looking for a ""cheap"" night stand not a piece of crap. It came nicely wrapped in a box but when I took the pieces out,one of the slates was broken so I used wood glue. Then I attempted to fit the sides to the back but they didn't match up well - so I used wood glue to help. Then there were missing holes, so I got a drill out (oh, btw, I'm a nurse!). Then I put the front on and the front doesn't match up on one side (you can see when the crossbar should go into the up and down leg but they don't meet together all the way. I wanted to use wood glue but I didn't have a clamp to hold it together long enough! This was a nightmare. I got it together but I am afraid to put a lamp on top of it b/c it might not support the weight (even with all my wood glue!). Bottom line...not worth your $39"
2,It was OK!,"This book is not for me. It talks and obsesses over Native Americans. If you like hearing about many Indian cultures and interest, read this book. But, personally, it was torture. (My English teacher didn't even care for it)"
3,Wanting More,"I picked up this book with interest, enjoying the general topic. Although a short book, it soon became tedious with little movement and much unspoken inferences. Noting it was a classic, perhaps the style of writing was better fitted for readers almost a century ago. The author, obviously an expert in his field, possibly assumed that others had a greater background of information. Therefore, scenes were introducted without introduction, leaving the reader somewhat perplexed. I would have found this book much more enjoyable if the narration provided some background that helped the reader understand the importance of the subtle action of the book. I would not recommend the book, reserving my time for other titles in this genre."
2,Unjust Java.,"First of all, I really enjoyed Van Der Linden's prior book, ""Just Java"". That said, this book's one great omnipresent flaw prevented me from developing a similar respect for ""Not Just Java"".In brief, this is perhaps the least objective book on computing I've ever read. To say that Linden has a prejudice toward Java, Sun, or against Microsoft is a wondrous piece of understatement. I can only conclude that Linden possesses a major block of Sun stock options and has sold Microsoft short. IMHO, definitely NOT a productive or instructive attitude, even from someone who disrespects M$ as much as I.The book badly needs a grounding in fair play. Its lopsided view of the world so distorts its view that the reader cannot escape its reality distortion field. Unfortunate and frustrating, from an author who has proven that he's capable of much better.I truly hope Mr. Van Der Linden's future writings don't continue down his present path, or his next book may be entitled ""Irrelevant Java""."
5,"An Engrossing, Realistic Look at an Ugly Subject: Death","Dr. Bert Keizer really held my attention with this book he is an anwesome writer and I really enjoyed this book from the first page. He is ruggedly honest and fair to his patients, even kind and gentle when they are dying.I enjoyed the humor, the brutal honesty, and the intellectual integrity of this beautiful and insightful book.My only complaint is the translation from Dutch to English is less-than-perfect. It seems that the editor was in a hurry or not interested in the final outcome of this book. But overall it is very great reading!"
2,Too many voices at work here,"This album is a prime example of why most opera singers should keep away from the great American songbook. (And I say vice versa to the likes of Michael Bolton, Barbra Streisand and Aretha Franklin.) Although Price was hard to beat in ""Trovatore,"" ""La Forza del Destino,"" and even some Richard Strauss, this kind of music calls for a style that was foreign to her. The many voices she uses - some unsupported - would have given my voice teacher a heart attack. Often the choice of keys exposes the break in her registers mercilessly. I suppose the varied English pronunciation she uses from song to song was an intentional choice; it doesn't work for me. Album space is wasted on two mediocre, long-forgotten songs by André Previn and his then-wife Dory. This album was a big disappointment."
3,Miles ages,"Not up to her usual quality level.Missed the usual sparkling dialogue between Miles and the enemy, but am looking forward to Miles, the father of two, in her next effort."
3,For diehard fans only...,"If you are not a diehard fan of this author and haven't read any of the other books in the series, I wouldn't recommend this book. This is not true of most of the books in the series. Most of them are fantastic, 5 star reads. I found this particular story to be a bit disjointed and not quite as engaging as the other Miles Vorkosigan books. However, if you have read every book in the series (like me) and are a diehard fan (like me), it is definitely worth reading to continue with the storyline.One thing, the ending really gives you something to look forward in the next book. :-)"
3,"OK, but not up to usual Bujold standards","I was anticipating this book since I finished reading ""A Civil Campaign"" (twice, the second time to see what I missed while I was desperately trying to avoid laughter-induced seizures). However, it seems a little thin in points, especially as the typical Bujold intricate plot unfolds. There are resonances here of current world affairs that it would have been nice to see a post-Sept 11 take via Miles, a nice foil. Also, the subtleties of Miles' peculiar relationship with the Cetagandans (see ""Cetaganda""--the best of the early Miles books, and the series installment with the most bearing on this novel) aren't explored nearly enough for my taste; the ending chapter, with its wake-out-of-near-death to find all loose ends are tied up, really makes this apparent.Still anything with Miles in it, though notable characters are conspicuous by their absence (see Ivan's role in ""Cetaganda"" and ""A Civil Campaign""), is worth reading"
5,Old Home Week...,"In Diplomatic Immunity, in addition to Miles bending his considerable brain power on yet another crisis, we find out what happened to one of Miles' old friends, who is also mixed up in the current crisis.It's Old Home Week in another sense, too, in that we discover what it was that the quaddies did with the freedom they took 200 years ago in Falling Free. The depiction of the society they've built is engaging and fascinating.This is another fantastic Miles Vorkosigan book. What can I say? Read it."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the biggest hunk of junk I've ever purchased. When I bought it at Christmas time, it was $129.99 and even though the price has been reduced an additional $40.00, it's not worth it. This piece of junk stopped playing DVDs a few days after the 90 day warranty expired and last week it stopped working altogether. The unit will turn on but automatically shuts off every time you try to change the channel. So basically, I paid $130.00 so my daughter could watch TV for less than 5 months. Save your money and buy a known brand name."
5,Great for toothaches too!,"My wisdom teeth are growing in and I occasionally have pain while I wait for my surgery. I've tried all sorts of cough drops, toothache gels, and numbing agents, but nothing works better than Ricola on a toothache. These taste soooo good too."
3,SYBIL DANNING'S INCREDIBLE BODY DESERVES 5 STARS,"Video consists of three shows of the old Hitchhiker Series. The one titled ""Face to Face"" with the fully tanned B-Movie Queen SYBIL DANNING is the best. Each episode deals with the moral lesson that when someone does something wrong, it comes back to haunt them."
1,triumph of form over function,"Might be good if someone was never going to use another mouse, ever again. Otherwise, stay away; get a mouse with buttons in the normal locations. Perhaps this style will show up in an Ikea light someday."
5,Great product..,I used this product in conjunction with the door-lock kit to have keyless entry in a 91 Geo Metro.. Worked perfectly !!
1,NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT,"Caution - the instructions and the web site offer technical support - NONE EXISTS! The phone number listed does not return multiple messages (although it says you will be called back in 15 minutes) and emails to the tech support web site are returned as undeliveable.You can probably install it in a ""normal"" US made car but if you have a BMW you may be out of luck."
4,Just what I needed!,"One day, my key stopped fitting in my driver's side lock (I'm pretty sure someone tampered with it, trying to break into my car when I was in the store). I looked into my options, and this seemed like an inexpensive option (and more fun than replacing the lock!). I have a 96 Nissan Sentra, and my Dad (who is an engineer and VERY good at fixing/installing stuff) had it installed in less than an hour. I definitely recommend asking someone who has some experience with this type of task to do it, but its DEFINITELY not worth paying a mechanic for. Since my car doesn't have an electronic trunk button, I couldn't hook up that function, but I still got everything I needed out of this product! Very satisfied!"
4,"Good Price, Average Tech","The price was great on these (around $40), the tech is not that easy to install but the instructions are good and the installation is car specific. The remote unlock button is small and recessed making it not super convenient to unlock the car which is what I mainly use the fob to do. Lock is much easier(larger button). But, the ability this package brings for the price is a very good value if you have pretty good electrical/car installations skills and documentation for your vehicle."
4,Just One Flaw,"I would have rated this 5 stars if the cut with Michael Crawford, creator of the role, were better. The song the producers chose did not showcase his amazing vocal talent. The other Phantoms start to sound alike after a while which isn't bad because they are all terrific, but including a cut that demonstrates his unique style would have made this album perfect."
5,Mary Thomas's Dictionary of Embroidery Stitches,I am just started in embroidering on greeting cards. This book has helped me alot with different stitches than the normal ones I see others doing in this craft.
3,"it didn't work, but maybe it's not gasket seal's fault...","I liked WMF pressure cooker, but after two years, it started leaking the steam between the lid and pan, so I bought the gasket.I don't know why, but it didn't work. I don't see the steam, but just my pressure cooker didn't work.I have Fagor stainless steel pressure cooker. Some steam is away between the lid and pot, but it does work as a pressure cooker."
3,Sea Serpent Review,"I like the book ""Summer of the Sea Serpent"" because it is an adventure. It is the 31st book in the series ""The Magic Tree House."" The characters are jack and Annie. they are young wizards who have to get a sword but to get it, they must answer questions from the sea serpent. Read the book to find out if they got the sword."
5,Great Easy to use belay device,"One of the easiest to use belay devices. Push a loop of your rope through the slot, and clip in your carabiner through the wire loop and rope. Couldn't get any easier to load. Great for single rope belays, and requires almost no effort to stop a fall. Cheap enough to stock enough for Scout Troops without sacrificing quality. When I teach a new belayer, I teach them on an ATC."
1,Don't waste your money,This has to be the worst tarot book/tape I have purchased so far in my quest to learn all I can about the tarot. Unless you are interested in endless rambling that will not teach you anything about reading tarot cards then do not waste your money.
2,SO SO,I bought this DVD because I like Masala Bhagra fitness video. It was difficult to keep up with the twins and not enough room in my living room to do it. Before I knew it the dvd was done. It did get my heart rate up but for only 20 mins I try to keep it up for at least 30-45. Overall it's just another workout dvd in my collection that I probably won't go back to.
4,Fun DVD,"This DVD is entertaining and a good workout. The time really flew--when I work out, I'm usually watching the clock and bored. Today I was engaged the entire time and surprised when the cool-down started--it seemed as if we'd only just begun dancing!Note: The case lists that this is a combination of hip-hop, martial arts, and Indian dancing. I really only saw the bangra in the DVD itself."
3,NO POLAR NIGHTS.....But still a decent Piece of Work,"I just recently purchased this album and much too my disappointment Polar Nights was not on the playlist. I have been a huge Scorpion Fan for the past 30 years but talk about being letdown. Polar Nights is truly a classic song that featured Uli Jon Roth's great writing and gutiar skills. It is very hard to listen to this CD based on the fact that Polar Nights is missing on this CD. Thank God for vinyl, I had to crank up the old turntable to get my fix of Polar Nights tonight.........HS"
5,awesome,the service that I received was amazing cd arrived in very good condition and early. I will be doing business again thank you!
4,Classic Album,Hoyt Axton is a really good song writer. He wrote Snowblind Friend which Steppenwolf would later make a big hit.I got this for my brother for Christmas and he was thrilled.
5,Inspiring and Insightful,Wonderful movie about a wonderful person. I enjoyed every minute of the film and recommend it. Be like water my friends...
2,"Er.. Its okay, I guess..","I was really looking forward to this album, sadly it just didnt stand up to the repeated listening test that all his other albums have passed with flying colors. You can't say this album is bad, I love tricky, but it just wasn't satisfying, too easy to listen to, which isn't always a good thing. The great thing about tricky is that each album is a new experience, and usually takes some work to get in to, which inevitably is worth it, not with blowback. Okay, you have to get it if you've got all the others, but by no stretch of the imagination is this his best work. I wouldnt say steer clear, but don't have great expectations. Song for Yukiko and Five Days are the highlights, maybe even You don't Wanna, but Im sorry I just didnt get Hawkman. Hopefully the next album will be more inventive, less radio friendly, but nevertheless tricky remains one of my favourite artists, and is no doubt a genius, he's just had a bad day!!"
3,OK,I thought that the first 3 or 4 songs were good but after that they became repetitive and irratating.
3,disappointment,"I bought this cd because it is Tricky. I love all his solo albums because they are so unique and challenging. For me I don't like his collaborations and this is no exception. My favourite track is ""A song for Yukiko"" which is the only Tricky song on the album."
2,Not that great,"If you expect this album to be as beautiful and truly genius as Maxinquaye, then you should really think again. Some songs on this album really are progressive and moving (Excess and Evolution Revolution Love) but most of the rest are just so Not-Tricky. He has moved further away from hip hop and is now including singers such as Anthony Kiedis, and is not teaming up with the lovely Martina as in Maxinquaye. One of the most awful songs I've ever heard is on this album, which is a cover of Nirvana's Something in the way."
2,Ok COMPILATION OF FOOTAGE,"This DVD Is just a compilation of thoughts by U2 biographers, not bad if you are a crazy U2 fan, but NOT recommended to de casual fan."
5,"5 stars for price, brand and design","I thought this was a great deal for 12 bowls. These bowls are sturdy like pyrex and for people who like to eat cereal and soup from deep bowls, these are perfect. Everyone in my family prefers (except me) deep bowls but I kept running out of them with my current dish set, so I bought these for a fantastic price. They arrived perfectly intact. Recommend."
5,Great!,"I'm so happy to have more glass bowls. I had 4. When one was broken I bought this box of 12. I have so many other bowls that are supposedly ""microwavable"" stoneware. The problem is, the stoneware heats before the food. Glass is the perfect dish to use in the microwave as it doesn't heat as the stoneware does."
2,Won't stay connected,"This cable keeps slipping out of the socket on my MacBook Pro anytime the laptop is moved--even slightly. My previous cable had metal connectors at the end, which stayed secure when moving the laptop. You can't tell what material the connector ends are made of by viewing the photo."
3,Good for the price,"This item is good for the price, at $99 it is a good value.A couple things that might sway your decision.- It looks a bit cheap in person..- It is a VERY HOT comforter.. It is only on our bed during the day and then its in a pile on the floor while we sleep.- The sheets sleep nicer than their thread count would sugget."
1,Less than I had expected,"I was looking for something to replace Parson's Technology Address Book. This product is NOT it. It is far more primitive, allowing only a single file of addresses and no provision for a return address. This product works ok if you are looking for something very basic. I've deleted the program from my computer and won't be using it again."
3,Just not what I wanted to see...,"I found it very difficult to get into this film. I normally like period pieces and I normally have absolutely no problem with slow moving dramas but this film felt like it was going no where for so long. I will say that after you got passed the first thirty or so minutes it grabbed my attention and kept me entertained for the remainder of the film. While it's not a film I would own or dare I say ever really watch again it's a film I'm glad I saw at least once. Pfeiffer was remarkable here, inhibiting her character and oozing forth with charm and elegance and this undeniable sexuality. Daniel Day Lewis was also well cast as social scion Newland Archer who is torn between his engagement to May (Ryder) and her cousin the Countess Olenska (Pfeiffer). The film was beautifully shot so I will give Scorsese props for his directing, I just wish that it would have really struck me and made me want to watch it again, but it didn't. It's not a bad movie but it's far from great."
5,surprised and enlitened,"The acting was superb, an surprised me, the set decoration was wonderful. The detail of NYC and the mansions, table settings and even the food of that era were terrific. The love story though predictable was very good. I'm ready, take me back the 1870's. Just kiding!"
2,Its OK,This film was good to an extent. The acting and the directing was good though. The film was just boring at some parts. I believe they draged it out alot. I wouldn't buy it. I would only rent it.
2,a gilded age covered up an empty era; a gilded film covers up an empty movie,"god bless martin scorsese for giving it a shot, but short of the exquisite look of the movie, nothing else works. one is prepared for an immature performance from winona ryder (could she give any other type?) but when the likes of michelle pfeiffer and even daniel day lewis [!] appear stilted, something is just plain wrong. i get the impression that scorsese made this movie anticipating it would gain him respect; instead its just one of those occasional blips in his grand career."
5,Very strng but a for-sure favourite!,"As a heads up - If you do not like strong flowery jasmine then do not purchase this product!It is simply not for everyone.That being said, if you love the smell (as I do) then you should be delighted. I stock up on these bad boys for bad days and loooong hot baths. Truly an indulgence!!I have seen a few reviews saying there was no smell, little smell or a strange smell not like in the store - Lush products are made from mostly natural, often organic ingredients. They do have shelf lifes and are not all perfect. Once in a while you will get a dud - This comes from the fact that they are made from REAL INGREDIENTS!!! If you call Lush support or go into the store they are pretty good about replacing a dud or giving you many free samples to try other products!"
1,"Gag! Migraineurs, asthmatics, and sinus headache sufferers beware....","I enjoy hot baths for relaxing after a stressful day and for headache relief. Breathing in hot steam is theraputic and I often enjoy a lightly-scented bubble bath. The scent in this product, however, CAUSED a headache and is overpoweringly obnoxious. My husband has scrubbed the tub to no avail trying to remove any residual ODOR and we have the bathroom vent along with two air purifiers running simultaneously in the bathroom...24 hours after using the sex bomb...trying to rid our home of the fumes. After breathing the thick, contaminated air permeated by this product, we feel like we've coated our lungs with something really, really noxious. Sex bomb? No way! This would make a better BUG BOMB!"
2,not-so-sexy,I LOVE Lush products but this particular Bath Bomb had an overpowering scent that didn't seem sexy.
4,Very good printer,Color photos come out with different color. They look like with more contrast. I wish the auto feeder could support at least 2 types of input such as photo papers and letter size papers. It prints very good jobs except for the photos.
3,Not Bad,"I haven't used the printer that much, but what I have used it for has been good. I'm a college student so i mostly print out text documents. They are not the absolute best quality, but the printer gets the job done. I have also experimented with printing photos. I printed out a photo i got off of the internet on to glossy photo paper and the picture came out pretty well. This printer has 3 individual cartridges for color instead of that one big one. i don't know if this is helpful or not, or if it will cost me more in the long run. The biggest complaint i have about the printer is that if u try to use only a few papers in the paper tray it takes a long time for the paper to feed into the printer, and you may have to help it along. Besides that, its fine. I just needed a realitively cheap printer to bring with me to college. I haven't even tried out all of itz features."
5,A great printer at a great price!,"I purchased this printer to replace an ailing Canon S520. The output is excellent, and fast, especially on color photos. This printer boasts a paper tray that can be adjusted to accept print sized photo stock as well as plain letter sized paper. Of course, to get the best results with photos you must use specialty paper. Amazon had the best pricing and the delivery was quick."
3,Too Produced,"I fell in love with Antje while listening to WERS in Boston and watching her play on youtube. Big Dream Boulevard is good, but I was very disappointed that Dandelion had been redone in a very over produced manner. Where is the depth that I fell in love with? Some songs are too fast and I just wish Antje had left things as is. Get back to your folk roots and you'll be great."
1,WARNING!,"Warning, this is a seriously BUTCHERED version of the film. Disny, in all of it's wisdom, has decided to cut over 6 minutes of the film. Do yourself a favor and get ahold of the fox lorber/winstar release, orif you've got the cash, pick up the criterion edition."
4,One of the best Christian Jazz artists in years,"It is so awesome to have a christian make such great jazz music. As a christian myself, I believe that if worldly people can make good music, then the people of God can make music too. This music not only entertains, but it ministers. If you are a christian who likes jazz, but doesn't want secular music, I highly recommend this album and many more of Ben Tankard's albums."
3,Thourgh a Glass Darkly,"Interesting travel review of Venice, but not much of a mystery novel. Not one of Donna Leon's best. It is a murder mystery, and the mystery does not start until page 167. In ""Death in a Strange Country"", the victim is identified in the first sentence, and the book is exciting to read right from the beginning."
1,Not One of Leon's Best,"I,ve just been introduced to Donna Leon's Commissario Brunettiseries and so far all have been almost ""cant put down"" books butthis one didnt particularly interest me. I am all for saving theplanet and deplore dumping ; it,s just something I do not reallyenjoy reading about in a mystery plus this one got rather boringI thought. Some of her mysteries are among the best written today.Just not this one."
2,Terribly unrealistic.,"This is juvenile alternate history. The elaborate society of conquest driven, slave holding empire Stirling ctreates here is something likely to only entertain the young and perhaps those with an unreflective mind or a poor grasp of basic history. Stirling's Drake Empire is one that employs a massive servile populations, treats them atrociously and then arms them to make them the bulk of the empire's armed forces. The armed helots are called 'Jannissaries,' and a better understanding of the history of slave soldiers, Jannissary and Mamluk, would have benifitted the author immensely. Save your money. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is that to say I hate it would be investing it with more emotion than I am willing to give it."
3,bad ending,"i really hate endings that are thought provoked and just leave you hanging..... all through this movie the director and actors had me so unbelievably angry with this child, and i really did want to see that he had not fooled everybody. hopefully, that was what his uncle's last scene with him was about. that he glimpsed something in the evil little boy...julie from milwaukee"
4,ONE OF THE BEST SERIES TODAY,"STILL ONE OF THE BEST SERIES AVAILABLE TODAY, EVEN DO THE FIRST SEASSON WAS MUCH BETTER..."
5,The Boys Are Out!,"The status quo has radically shifted but the intensity has in no way declined. Prison Break serves as a delightful counterpoint to the numerous Gong Show rip-offs and the onslaught of dramas that resolve all plot points within 42 minutes. With a stellar cast and nerve-wracking cliffhangers Prison Break continuously proves itself to be one of the finest shows on television today. If you are a fan of programs that feel like ongoing movies like Lost or anything on HBO, you will not be disappointed with Prison Break."
5,Prison Break Seasons 1 & 2,"I bought this for my husband and thought it was just a ""guy"" flick. Boy, was I wrong! This is very exciting and kept my attention. Couldn't wait to go to the next disc."
5,Prison break review.,"This is one of my favorite shows, though I would recommend buying the first season (and the 3rd and the 4th) so you know what's going on better."
5,Game Changer!,"This episode is definitely a game changer! Nail biting, dramatic, and yes, shocking. This series just continues to punch you right in the face with great action, writing, and clever twists and turns. You're going to love this episode. I agree with one of the other reviewers, too - this is a great episode to catch up on things. This is like a mini action movie!"
2,Prison Break season 2`,Prison Break is my favorite show so I was ecstatic to buy all of the seasons. My season two came today and I'm a incredibly disappointed. A seller should definitely inform the buyer that the cd's are not in there originally casing. I received this in a plastic covering. Very upset.
2,A big disappointment,"This film is based on a promising storyline arising from true events. However, it has lost its way. I believe the story has been told from the wrong perspective and, although the actors are all good looking, their delivery is wooden and the script is stilted. As a result, it comes out like a B series, day-time soap. Sorry, guys, I tried to like it, but..."
1,Save youe money!,"It was terrible...it was a low budget ""B"" movie...with poor (to say the least) acting.....need I say more? I got suckered into buying the flick with all the pre-relaese hype. Don't bother buying it, come get it out of my trash can."
5,I liked it,"I thought it was a good movie. There were a few scenes that weren't necessary but I think the story and acting was very well done. It mainly deals with coming out to parents. One of the characters in this movie was sent away to an institution when he told his parents he was gay. It's very disturbing to hear what he went through but what is more disturbing is that parents actually do this to their children. These places need to be shut down and any parent who sends their child to one should be put in jail. But anyway, buy this movie. It may open your mind to a few things. It's a shame movies like this aren't more widely seen by the public."
1,not so hot,It is clear in the very first chapter that the writers don't know the difference between sodium nitrate and potassium nitrate. I don't think I have the time to read my copy further as it is sophomoric and evidently not accurate information.
2,Marginal Book of Fact and some Errors,"Some dull facts and trivia about a variety of sports, mostly covering alot of English and Olympic sports. However I have discovered a few mistakes within the book, most of them are wrong years."
1,WORSE VIDEO,"This product was way below par - I have been a coach for 40 years and have purchase many, many books,videos and other coaching products. The quality of this video was horrible. I expect to see players and coach demonstrating or at least a whiteboard. All I saw was this guy Billy Best talking and some (very, very few) grainy footage of Offense vs Defense that looked like it was taken from the next county.I requested a refund but never heard back from these people. Amazon asked me to give them a chance to make it right, but they didn't. DON'T BUY FROM THEM - you have been warned..."
3,Brush is fine,"The bristles on this brush are as advertised and are soft, and hold the oils well. The ferrule on my brush was loose and halfway through my first-time use, it fell off the handle. I used some gorilla glue to re-attach it and it's worked perfectly since. Like I said, the bristles are great, but the workmanship on the ferrule and the handle could be better. I would buy this one again, for sure, since the only issue I had, was easily correctable."
4,"Good book, informative",This is great book for the novice homeowner. Very informative and instructions are clear. Would recommend to a friend. thanks
2,Home Improvement for Dummies,My recommendation would be to not buy this book. Unless you mostly want to read about how to hire a contractor. There are a few books out there much better for the weekend do it yourselfer then this.
3,Where are the five Internet Chapters in Building Kylix Apps?,"I recently bought the book by Cary Jensen and Loy Anderson, Building Kylix Applications, expecting specially for a full coverage on the Indy Client / Server and Misc palettes which I didnt see. There are some pages showing how to develop CGI Apps, Working on Apache Web Servers, amongst few others. The book has really a good covering of database applications, component creation and some other things, but, to be honest, about the Internet Coverage, is not half as I expected."
5,Foyle's War Wins,"This is a great series both for a history of British homeside involvement in WWII and for the mysteries solved with each episode. True, I'm sure Hastings didn't have so many murders or mysterious killings during the war, but then neither does Oxford in the Morse or the Lewis series. Even the accents are understandable except occasionally for Honeysuckle Weeks. Great acting and great stories, what else could you want?"
4,great for dj's and quick info on artist/groups,"This book, as well as Top 40 Hits, are essential for anyone in radio or multi-format disc jockey businesses. I own a disc jockey business and these 2 books are like bibles. Just wished they'd get updated yearly or every other year."
2,these reviews must be written by friends of Jessies,"the guitar work is hit&run soloing and average, the drum machine stinks if you really really loved and still love The Time spend your money, that's all folks"
3,It's OK,"I sprayed the grout with this product, and there was improvement but I think I'll just stick with Soft Scrub in the future."
1,Grout cleaner & resealer TLOSQT-3,"Not worth the money. Wore 2 scrub brushes out, even then it only did a half way job. Awesume from the Dollar Store does a better job. Better yet ""Zep"" from Menards doesn't require all the scrubbing and does a MUCH BETTER job."
3,One Bite at a Time,"This book was recommended to me by my friend - a gormet cook. Unfortunately, I am not. The recipes were nothing I was interested in learning how to cook and nothing my husband was interested in eating. It was too much to think about on top of everything else. If you have a lot of time to be in the kitchen or have been a gormet cook up to this point, I'm sure the recipes are wonderful. I just couldn't deal with it."
3,Cancer and nutrition,"I think the book is good, and the recipes look good, but I wish it included the nutritional values. It will be useful though."
4,Wireless Mouse,"Great mouse - but when plugged into my dell notebook, the screen saver won't EVER start. I always need to unplug it from the USB 2.0 port. But the mouse itself is great."
1,Dying after less than 4 months,"This mouse worked fine when I first got it, but now it's just not functioning. It's so slow to move the arrow, and I have to click three or more times to get whatever I'm clicking on to respond. I've changed the batteries, and still no luck. This is a real piece of junk. Don't buy it!"
3,Not as good as it was....,"I bought this to replace the same model from 2 years ago, which had the jointed receiver, and was beginning to have trouble holding the signal. That was a really good mouse, despite the lack of extra buttons. Now, the range is barely 12'...and it matters if your USB connection is on the left, as mine is. I can no longer use this on a side table, with the laptop on my lap - 18"" is too far. On the plus side, works right out of the box with Mac OS X."
3,workable,"I think this mouse worked fine for a period of time. I felt that it might need change of batteries pretty often, maybe once in 2 months. I play games a lot and I think this mouse lasted for 8-9 months after which it completely stopped working. I think this mouse is functional for a period of time. Sometimes it behaves very choppy if the distance from where it is used is maintained for a period of time."
1,broke,lasted 6 months and stopped working. Seem like a great product from the review and maybe i got the crappy one. I wont buy Microsoft mouse again.
4,Micro-Small,"Would have rated it a 5, however it is tiney. If you have regular sized hands this may seem a tad bit small for you. Comfortable and works well just on the small size. great for a kid or person with small hands."
3,Not bad,"I have purchased 2 of this mice for about 1 month.They are easy to use and free of wire.But you can not get the mice's power off unless you take the sigal radiator off from the laptop then put it into the bottom slot of the mice. or you have to get the battary out of it. otherwise, the light of the mice will always on----wasting of the battary!if there has a button on the mice to turn the power off, maybe better."
4,Microsoft Wireless Notebook Optical Mouse 3000 -Slate,A recommended item for ones lap top computer. Much easier and comfortable to use than the mouse on the key board pad.
5,awesome mouse,"works great. perfect quality, although sometimes i have to unplug and replug in the usb connector in order to get the mouse working. doesnt happen often though."
5,wireless mouse,"This is the first and only wireless product that I have purchased.I wanted a mouse for my laptop and checked the reviews. This unit sounded good and was a great price. It was shipped quickly. I am not a heavy user of my laptop, so far this has met all of my expectations. I am very pleased with this purchase."
3,Not for Big Hands,I found this little mouse to be very uncomfortable for my big hands. If you have small hands I think it would be OK.
3,Decent optical mouse,"For the price, this is a wonderful mouse. We are a small neurological practice, so I bought two of these to help two left-handed workers whose corded mice were constantly getting tangled. One draw back is the USB-design for the mouse. When the mouse USB is plugged into the computer the mouse is on. There is seemingly no way to turn off the mouse other than to unplug the USB and place back into the USB holder in back of the mouse. Ordinarily this wouldn't be a problem, but my two workers are fairly confused when it comes to handling computer hardware, and keep the USB plugged in thus leaving the mouse powered on at the end of the day. Not a big deal for people who remember to unplug their USB and place it back into the mouse when they are done."
5,Perfect for Laptop!!,i HATED using my laptop bc of the stupid mouse pad thingy. so annoying. got this microsoft mouse and it has improved my speed ten fold. it was super easy to set up. although i had a moment and put the battery in backwards. haha.i don't notice any lag although it's not far from the usb port. i can't speak to range at all. but i absolutely love my purchase and of course amazon was super quick to ship!
5,Great for laptops,"I was using a wired USB mouse for my new laptop and the wire was a hassel. Decided to go for a wireless mouse.Got a very good dea lfrom Amazon. and shipping was free!The mouse is perfect. It fits in to my hand really well, very comfirtable. No driver instalation was required, just plug and play. I really like that feature that the USB dongle snaps into the mouse for storage. The range is also very good.Can't comment on the battery life as I've not used it long enough to do so.A really nice product."
1,"Great mouse, for a month.","This little mouse worked great- for a month, until it died. I use a Mac and I plugged it in and away we went. It worked great immediately and really didn't give me any problems as long as it was actually alive. Then it suddenly quit working. I tried all the usual- several different batteries, restarting the computer, re-syncing the mouse, plugging in to all my different USB ports, but no luck. The computer recognizes the mouse is plugged in with the USB key, but the mouse no longer sends a signal when I move it. Sigh. Back to my old trusty Logitech."
2,You get what you pay for!,"I purchased this mouse because of the low price and good ratings. I really don't know how it got the good ratings. I am very disappointed in it. First of all, the USB transmitter is about twice the size of the Logitech mouse that I had. I'm always hitting it with my arm while I work. The worst part is that it keeps falling out of sync with the mouse and stops working, even though the mouse is about 6 inches from the transmitter.It's very possible that I just got a bad one, but I would suggest paying a little more for something that will work well right out of the box."
2,Good mouse but receiver dies in 6-8 months,"I'm currently on my second mouse from Microsoft, and I've had my mouse for about 8 months now, and the receiver has broken on me again.With the first mouse, I just assumed that it wasn't working due to some mishaps with moving apartments, but after getting the second one, I realized that the fault is not with me.It's a shame that they don't sell the receiver separately, because the mouse itself is actually very nice and works very well. I'm currently on my second battery for my second mouse, and while it's great that it's very efficient in its use of energy, it's not worth it in the long run to get this mouse to only have it die on you.I'll never order this again."
5,really good and comfortable,it was good and really comfortable to use. nice shape . fits perfectly. was needed for someone like me whose brain doesnt work with the laptop mousepads. might be few dollars more than I would have liked it though.
1,Erratic Behavoir with Toshiba Laptops - Returning it!,"Tried to use this with both my and my wife's Toshiba laptops. Performance erratic and flaky; stops and starts without rhyme or reason; worked in some usb ports, not in others.Very comfortable to hold and move, but erratic acceleration and performance = pure frustration."
1,It wore out quickly and stopped working,Spend a few more $$$ and get one that will last a little longer. Mine wore out after 6 months of daily use.
2,Ok but not great,"I bought this mouse for my office computer because it was easier for me to use wireless mouse. In the beginning it worked well and I had no problems with it, however, after a while it started making some problems especially not responding or getting stuck. After the first time it did not respond it continued making lots of problems that I had to stop using it and go back to the old wired mouse I had before."
3,Decent/Not that Bad,"I got this mouse at Staples because I wanted a gaming mouse (something so that I could play fast in Starcraft)PROS:I was intrigued by the ""battery-saving"" feature of the mouse....It's smaller than most mice and has very smooth trackingPlug and Play compatible- let it run as USB Human Interface Drive don't install windows drivers- they are crapCONS:However, wireless signal goes bad if you put the mouse at a distance greater than about a footBattery power goes down pretty fast....I went through about 20 batteries in the span of 2-3 weeks i think....and this has an affinity for oil (don't use while eating greasy foods).....I actually had to tear out the plastic covering.....-Wilson"
3,except Vista...,"It works great, I just wish the guy who sold it to me would have given me a heads up to have that I have go to Microsoft for a download for it to work with Vista."
5,Great mouse - the perfect size for laptops.,"I got this mouse for my laptop and it's great. I do have to hit the connect button sometimes when I first plug it in, but that's not a big deal to me. It's a great size, not full size, but not a 'micro' mouse like some of the 'laptop' mice are.Battery lasts ages too - you can place the dongle under the mouse which has a 'shut off' switch so it doesn't waste battery when not in use."
4,MS Optical Mouse,"Purchased this item as a gift for my wife's birthday. She was tired of the ""wired"" mouse she had; it was always getting in the way. So far, this wireless mouse has proven to be excellent. We've only had it less than a month but the batteries seem to be holding up well (a concern I had even tho' other reviews touted their longevity). The only feature I would like is that it could be turned off during breaks away from the laptop without pulling out the USB receiver."
4,Wireless Mouse Review,Works fine with my notebook; easy to install and store; information was extremely accurate and useful.
3,Check the distance of your USB plug and where you choose to use this mouse,"The mouse works fine if you are in the correct range, but you should know that the mouse needs to be 3 feet or less from the USB plug. I have not been able to use this mouse because my CPU is on the floor.I have another wireless mouse that I have no problem with so I am somewhat dissapointed that I won't be able to use this with my desktop."
4,good mouse with little details,"works good,though the range is pretty short and the receiver sticks out of my notebook quite a bit. besides those two details it works fine."
1,Terrible - didn't work right from day one,"The mouse is awful. The range on the wireless is less than a foot, the mouse doesn't always respond to movement and now, it has completely died. I haven't even had it more than 2 months. Terrible product."
5,perfect,"for everyday general use, its perfect. it only takes 1 AA battery and it lasts a real long time. great product, great buy"
4,Very reliable Mouse,"I've bought two of these for my laptops now (I hate not having a mouse for laptop use). This one installs in a snap, and the optical receiver snaps into the bottom of the mouse when not in use, so they arent lost. Nice size -- not as large as a full-size mouse, but also not as tiny as some of the other laptop mouses that are so easy to misplace...good buy for the money."
4,Happy mouse,"I just replaced my wired mouse with this one. At first, I was reluctant of purchasing a wireless mouse since I have a bad experience before where I need to replace thebattery every 2 weeks but thisone it's amazing it's been 2 months now and still haven't change the battery. My only disappointment, i think the product was not new anymore when I got it, it was wrapped in a bubble wrap and there are scratches at the bottom four corners. Otherwise it works very well."
1,Ouch,"This mouse worked great at first..... but within the first week i started having issues. The mouse refused to turn on after I removed the usb plug from the base but after some wiggling of the sensor-switch, i got it to work. Now, sometimes i have to flick my mouse really hard to get it to turn on. even if it turns on, the computer will frequently not register its connection. Based on the reviews, i have an out of the ordinary mouse.... but be wary. Would not buy again."
4,Wish the receiver was smaller,Great mouse expect for the rather larger snap in receiver. High quality stuff from Microsoft.
2,New model not as good,"Unlike the product title, the reviews here are meant for the Wireless Optical Mouse, which looks identical, but not the newer 3000 as indicated by the name. While identical looking, they are vastly different. The 3000 has an improved 6-month battery life (which is the only plus). The new model removed rotatable antenna on the USB dongle, which is really bad. Even short distance, these mice still experience interference every now and then. With the older model, you can rotate the antenna and get a better reception instantly, but with the new model the only option is to try to move it to another USB port. The 3000 model also has ""improved"" tracking precision, which means very erratic unprovoked spantaneous movements of the pointer in real life. Lastly, the wheel is not ""clicky"" as the older model and much tighter. Overall, most of good things which made the older model very popular are no longer in the newer 3000 model."
1,Ok at first but not as hardy as Logitech,"Had 2 MS mice fail this model and the MSK-1058. Neither as hardy, handy, nor feels as good as my Logitech M515. For price not a good value IMHO."
2,Not so Good,Terrible range compared to the other wireless mouse I own. Also the wheel seems real jerky when you rotate it.
2,More expensive than it is worth,"The USA receiver is too big. I bought another wireless mouse made by Logitech at almost the same price, and its receiver is very small and you don't need to unplug it when you put you laptop in the bag."
5,Microsoft Wireless Notebook Optical Mouse 3000 - Dragon Fruit Pink,"i order this product from amazon which arrived in record time, after shopping around for a good price and could not find a better price than amazon i decide to purchase it from amazon. the mouse work very good with my laptop. wireless is awesome, easy to use"
3,Works well with Vista and recommended for ambidextrous people like me,My only issue is that sometimes during use it has to be resynched. I could be typing or surfing the net and all of a sudden it starts blinking. Other than that it's very portable and fits in the laptop case. I like the ease of use in either hand. Recommended for all portable use.
1,Disposable Mouse,I've had two Microsoft 3000 mouses go kaput within one week. The most recent dead mouse lived less than 8 months in light use. I would not buy this mouse unless your goal is to fill up the land fills.
1,Worst Mouse Ever!!!,"I am very dissapointed in this mouse. It is very jerky in its movement over the mousepad, and slow in response. I am so frustated with it, I am going to have to purchase another mouse before I throw this one across the room. I should have stuck with Logitech and spent the extra money.I realized later that this is an optical mouse, and I should have gone with a laser mouse which gives much smoother movement.I need a mouse with a fast response for the work I do, and this one has caused nothing but frustration! I even had trouble getting it to rest over the one star rating so that I could click ""Hate it"". Going to try and click ""Submit"" now."
3,Interference with wireless mouse,"Caution to a purchaser. My wife has a similar mouse. When we are both on our computers, which are about five feet apart, whenever one of us uses our mouse, both mice act erratic or freeze."
1,not happy,As a handicapped user that uses computers quite a bit I am unhappy with this mouse. It is too easy to hit the right button especially when i get weak also the range is a problem. My wife complains often about losing control.All in all I am pretty unhappy with this purchase but there is no place I can go to try out items before I purchase them.
1,Stopped working after less than a month,"I bought this mouse because of all the great reviews. However, I had a different experience. It was great at first, although you couldn't use it on a magazine surface, or on cloth... But, less than a month after I purchased it from TigerDirect, it stopped working! My computer just doesn't recognize it, and the little light on the end of it doesn't light up anymore. Three days ago, it was working intermittenly... and two days ago, it worked the same way... and today it's out of business. What a waste of money. I'm definitely going back to the wire, and staying away from Microsoft mouses. I don't recommend this mouse."
3,The scroll button sucks!,"I bought this today. Overall feeling is better than the Logitech wireless notebook mouse, which I bought and returned.Pros:1. Snap in RF receiver, easy to carry2. Feeling is pretty good for this size3. Left and right button clicks siliently4. Only one AA battery, lighter than Logitech's oneCons:1. The scroll button is worse than Logitech's. It is loose, you can move it from left to right or right to left. Scroll down is fine, scroll up makes a lot of noise. Should not be my individual experience, I actually replaced one and it is the same.2. The driver cannot be installed if you have Logitech's mouseware installed already. I prefer using Logitech's mouse when my notebook is docked, but as said earlier, I had bad experience with Logitech's notebook mouse."
2,"With Microsoft, you get what you pay for","Microsoft makes really solid peripherals, BUT you must buy their high end stuff. This cheap mouse is just that -- a cheap piece of crap. Ours didn't work so we sent it back and bought a decent Logitech mouse."
2,Doesn't last long,This was a great mouse until it stopped working. I got about 6 months regular use and it started skipping. Died shortly thereafter.
5,"Great mouse and sturdy, too!","I bought this mouse for my kids' computer, since my 6 y/o gets very frustrated when a wired mouse won't move where he wants to. Installing this was a breeze, and it worked immediately. (Good thing with an impatient kid waiting.) We've been using it for 3 months on the same battery, and despite being tossed on the floor, whacked with a book and deluged with several spilled glasses of milk/juice/whatever, the thing still works. (I don't recommend trying to repeat our results, however.) I'm so impressed with the one I bought for the kids that I'm getting one for my own computer."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"This is exactly what I was looking for! It's the perfect size for my hand, and fits just fine into my laptop bag. The receiver fits right into the bottom of the mouse which is extreamly clever... I love that. I have never seen such a better value for an optical mouse like this one.The only thing that gets to me is that it's not exactly the same color as it appears to be on the computer screen. It's a little more navy than I expected, but I'm being extreamly picky here.It's also very very sensitive, which is both good and bad. I will have to get used to it, but I'd rather it be more sensitive than not enough.GREAT PRODUCT!!"
3,One needs an on/ off button to extend the useful battery life.,We need an on/off button to use when one does not use the optical wireless mouse. Otherwise it uses up your battery power during not use.Is there already such a feature developed/available in the market for this product? One gets tired of opening up battery section and...to save battery life.
5,Easy and Painless,"I was miserable when I purchased my notebook because the position of my hands was causing me so much wrist pain. The wireless mouse is perfect for me, works great, easy to use, and best of all, no more wrist pain! This is the perfect solution for anyone who spends as much time as I do on my computer and has carpal tunnel problems. Or for someone that is just more comfortable using a regular mouse."
4,Good product,I bought this mouse 3 months ago and it's been great so far. I just changed the battery after 3 months for the first time today and I use my laptop daily so I'm happy with the battery life(1 AA). It's nice that you can put the receiver into the mouse for storage and it also serves as an off switch but for those of us who rarely travel it's not so convenient to have to unplug the USB receiver each time you power down just to save battery life. I wish it had a normal on off switch or an idle timer to power down after inactivity.The best feature for me is that it's not too big and not too small. It fits my palm well and has a nice responsive feel.
3,"Great mouse, but .....","I was very happy with this mouse and did not even consider it when my screen saver stopped coming on. I called ""Dell On Call"" and asked if they could fix it for me. The first thing they asked was if I were using a Microsoft 3000 (or 6000 I think) mouse. I said yes.Turns out it's not compatible with Microsoft XP or Vista in terms of the screen saver. You have to pull out the USB plug to get the screen saver to work. He said Microsoft is working on ""a fix"", but in the meantime if you like your screensaver, steer clear of this mouse.So I bought a Logitech and it works beautifully. I gave this one to my husband who isn't very tech saavy (worse than me) and can live without his screen saver."
1,Send it Back,"So much for this mouse. Used it three or four times, it stopped working. Changed battery. Worked for an hour. Changed battery again. Worked for a couple of hours. Then nothing.Not worth the time it's taking me to write this review.F+ (The plus is for it's feel, which is just right for me and my Sony Vaio laptop.)"
4,Very convenient wireless mouse,My brother in law used this item so when I got this mouse on sale I was quick to jump at it. I like everything about this mouse except battery life. New battery will last about month and a half so I suggest people getting rechargeable battery unit. This is the reason I gave 4 out 5 star. But other then that I like this little gadget.
2,HOLY COW OMW! IT DOESNT RESPOND TO MOVEMENT!!,"Ok, #1. I opened it BRAND NEW...looks great and everything. I then plug it in and use it on my bed, leg, pillow, blanket, pair of pants, skin, AND THE CURSOR DOESNT MOVE! Why?? #2 I click...nothing happens..wtw? I right click, nothing happens, so then I double click slowly, then it decides to do what I say. I was told it's because the settings on my computer for the mouse are slow, so I changed it...still sucks...tell me why these things are happening plz...thankies!"
4,Affordable Wireless Mouse,"I recently bought a new laptop, and I hate using those touch pads. I decided to invest in a mouse, and this wireless one is great. I love the color, it's cute and matches my bedroom. No complicated installing, just plugged it into my Dell laptop and it was ready to go. It does require batteries, but supposedly the batteries last a really long time so not too inconvenient. I like the size and feel of the mouse. It's a bit small. This doesn't bother me at all, but if you have big hands and find small mice annoying, you may want to search for something different."
2,Disposable,"Good battery life, but only lasted 1 year. Loved it while it worked, but after 1 year of use, the scroll roller thingy is completely useless."
1,Very disappointing,"From day one this mouse has been glitchy. While it tracks faily well, its ability to register clicking is arbitrary and frustrating. It will click along fine for a while, and then for no obvious reason, it won't register a click no matter how I try. To get it working again, I have to remove the battery, unplug the usb, reinsert everything and then hope for the best.There are also two design components I dislike about this mouse. First, the usb connector is quite large compared to the connector on the Logitech optical mouse. This one is long, like a large thumb drive, and it's easy for it to get bumped or jostled as it sticks way out of the laptop. Second, this mouse has no on/off switch. The only way to power it down intentionally is to take out the battery. The Logitech optical mouse has such a switch.Owning both the Microsoft and the Logitech optical mouses (mice?), I strongly recommend the Logitech over the Microsoft."
5,Very convenient,"I love this mouse. I have a laptop and travel a lot and I think it's great. I was reading a previous review and she couldn't change the buttons to work for a left handed. By going on the microsoft website for this mouse it does have a software to download to change features on the mouse, although not needed unless you want to change anything. As for a carrying case, there should be one, but I just bought a little camera case and that works fine for me. Overall I think it's a very good purchase."
5,Microsoft has done it again!,"This mouse is a great little add-on for anyone looking for a wireless mouse for their notebook computer. Its light, has great range, great battery life, nice jog wheel for scrolling... no complaints here."
3,Limited Range,"I bought this in hopes of controlling my computer from a distance to control it playing video on my TV through a cable. Sadly that did not work out because the range on it seems to be limited to about 3 feet, and I needed more like 10. The mouse installs effortlessly with no software installation, works fine within the 3' range and seems well designed.One last caveat is that the packaging is one of those impossible to open blister packs which does not open without totally destroying it (which makes returning a hassle)."
4,Nice Product,"I bought this due to my experience with the same model in work. I knew it was a good product, so bought one for my home computer."
2,Good mouse...when it works,"I bought this mouse a few months ago and was mostly satisfied with it. It plugs in and the computer recognizes it in a matter of seconds, which is nice. Sometimes the left click was a little unresponsive, but it never really bothered me. The range is not that great, as the usb had to be plugged into the front of the pc rather than the back to work. Just a few days ago, the mouse completely stopped working. The laser appears to be stuck on and it won't connect with the computer. Microsoft's suggested ""fixes"" sometimes make it start working again, but after only a few minutes it goes back to doing the same thing. I would not recommend this product if it will only work for a few months before breaking."
2,Does not compare with a good bluetooth device on mac,"I did not like the mouse. It did not install on my mac OS1.6 very well; I got a message to call support. Like I'm going to spend hours on the phone for a mouse. It must be used with a mice pad otherwise it does not slide easily. The scrolling and was too fast. IHMO, bluetooth is superior USB for mice. I knew that. Other vendors have a superior bluetooth solution. Why did I waste my money."
3,Too sensitive,"This mouse is compact and installation was easy. The only drawback is that it's very sensitive, which makes it a bit hard to use."
1,Reciever designed by people who don't know design,"I just have a problem with the design of the reciever. I bought this at Best Buys and I returned it instantly. I think people who think that functionality must be incorporated into design and that functionality must be obvious will like it. I rather not have it fold and be so obvious that in order for it to be a proper antennae, it must fold. I think tech geeks will probably think it's cool. I think the folding antennae does add to the reception distance (maybe by inches), but I don't plan on using my mouse 10 feet away from my laptop.Also, I would have liked a rubber scrollwheel instead of cheap plastic.I ended up getting the Logitech V200. The reciever of the Logitech simply is a stub. And it works fine. Looks like a memory stick. No folding, no green light, no moving parts, no odd shapes for it to be bumped in to and break easier, just a simple little stick that protrudes a bit. 1 year battery life on the V200, not sure about the MS mouse."
3,Could be better,"This mouse does everything that it is supposed to do but I think the Logitech M305 is a much better alternative. The features are almost identical but the Logitech receiver is nano-sized and the range/connection seem to be much better and more stable. In addition, you can enable the tilt wheel on the Logitech for horizontal scrolling (good with Excel). So in short this mouse is okay (I've owned two) but I'm sold on the M305 now."
1,This mouse sucks.,"at first this mouse worked great. The problems started to appear on the next start up after I installed the mouse. The new hardware installation wizard started to appear and continue doing so every time I restart the computer. All it takes is just cancel that wizard, but it's annoying.But that's not even a problem. The problem is that the roller wheel broke and did not respond and wasn't making those clicking sounds anymore on the 4th day after I purchased it. I had to take it back to the store and exchange it. So far the second mouse works, but that installation wizard still keep appearing no matter what I tried to do."
4,Great Mouse,"This mouse worked right out of the box. I plugged in the receiver to my USB port and that was that. It has a good feel to it and the wireless operation worked perfect. I am not a big fan of the touch pad mouse on laptops, and this makes life much easier when I use it. There are newer models that have a nano receiver (that I also own), but if that is not an issue or need, this mouse stands up to Microsoft's reputation for quality and ease of operation. Plus, the color is great."
3,Ehh...,It's okay but stops working sometimes for a minute at a time. I would not recommend for people needin mouse to work fully for an hour long.
4,Wireless Optical mouse,"Works great for me.. very convenient, very compact. I have a nerve condition which makes using my laptop mousepad impossible. This is an excellent substitute. In fact, I bought 2 more for our desktop computers. Resonably priced."
5,Perfect 10!,"I have had this mouse for just a few days and it is the coolest thing ever! And the color is great! No worries about hubby borrowing it anytime soon! It works perfectly. Glad I made the purchase and plan to purchase another one soon. Best feature is how the part that plugs into the usb port when not in use, fits underneath the mouse and becomes one unit for carrying. This stops the battery in the mouse from draining. Great idea."
4,Nice but short range,"Nice design and feel, single AA baterry is an advantage, the only 2 things I didnt like about it were: the USB transmitter, its large for a tiny mouse like this & it has a short range (in case you connect your laptop to your TV to watch movies, you wont be able to keep your laptop away)."
4,good awesome,"i was impressed htat the climax that Avant made from his other album. a great buy, with a traditon of good and soft beats that keep you poppin'. a great album!"
3,A MEDIOCRE ALBUM,"This was Avant's third album.With this one you get a kinda good kinda not so good album.some of the lyrics are really really cheesey (eg.""Flickin"",""You Got Me"", ) just to name a couple.The song ""Dont Take Your Love Away"" shows that his voice has improved from when he first entered the bizz. The lead singls ""Read Your Mind"" is nice but once he gets to the bridge it sounds..well...cheesey!!!!The songs ""Have Some Fun"" and ""Phone Sex(Thats Whats Up)"" Their beats sound like a vidoe game but they are ....alright...Another song that is good is the duet with Olivia..""Seems to Be"" it has a nice beat and the lyrics are tolerable..Overall he came with a nice album but next time he cant do better...Waiting for album Number 4.................OVERALL GRADE 80/100 = B"
2,ABC and 123 LYRICS!!!!!,"The album is almost great. I like 12 out of the 16 on the album 75%. Avant has a great voice the production is excellent, but he has no song writing talent period. Avant lyrics are VERY elementary. Its like listening to a nursery rhyme. (example. "" come to my place so i can see your pretty face.) Come on get more creative. Avant wrote the album in his shower. It's a good album other wise."
5,ONE OF THE BEST,"I have been listening to Straight Company for many years, growing up in the Church of Christ.. If you haven't seen them in person, what a treat you are missing... jesse and all guys and girls do a great. job... i really miss pops, the older man that song with the group"
4,Latin Jazz Greats,"Live in Manhattan Center Studios, New York City,Very few Latin jazz videos are produced, so snatch this one up right away. Song titles include: Bembe, Straight Street, Suite 925-2828, Five Beat Mambo, Everyday I Have The Blues On Fire, Rumba De Cajón Musicians include: Juan Pablo Torres - trobone Dave Valentin - flute Hilton Ruiz - piano Eddie Palmieri - piano Tito Puente - timbales Johnny Almendra - bomngos Richie Flores - congas Giovanni Hidalgo - congasHoracio ""El Negro"" Hernandez - bateria Charlie Sepulveda - trumpet Jillian - vocal Michel Camilo - piano David Sanchez - tenor sax"
2,A very patchy album,"I've no idea why fans of Chapterhouse rate Whirlpool as their best album. Blood Music is much more consistant, the tracks are stronger and well produced, and it has also aged much better than Whirlpool.Whirlpool to my ears always sounded like the work of a band who didn't really know what they wanted to achieve, and consequently they made a bit of a dog's dinner of their first album. Admittedly there are some great moments; the obvious examples being Breather and Pearl. But there are some very weak links too, where they really do sound like just another derivative shoegazing band trying unsuccessfully to rip off a few My Bloody Valentine riffs (and the lesser moments of MBV at that!)If all you've heard is Pearl amd you liked it, then I think you'd be happier purchasing Blood Music first. Don't be distracted by the new version of Whirlpool with the bonus tracks from the early EPs; those songs are just as hit and miss as the original album tracks."
5,"""Oceans of fantasy"" Boney M CD","Great band, great songs. The delivery service was very fast, did not have any problems. Very satisfied."
3,"You might like it, you might not","This is one of those books I have had for a long time, and started to read several times, but never did until recently. The book is described in quite a bit of detail by others' reviews, to I won't repeat that. I found this book interesting not so much for the story as for the description of frontier life of that time, and the conflict between what the Priests were trying to lead the Indians to belive and what the Indians actually did believe. This was culture shock and misunderstanding at its finest. This was actually a good book once I finally set down to read it, but I wouldn't rate it a 4 or 5 just because it isn't a book I could do without. If I hadn't read it, I don't feel I'd be missing anything I haven't or wouldn't come across somewhere else. That said, Brian Moore is a great story teller and I don't think many will be disappointed in the book. If you are shocked by profanity (""bad"" words that is), however, you might pass this book by."
1,Black Robe,"Extremly hard to follow, and very dull book. A jonny come lately approach to writing about the American frontier. I suggest something with a bit more adventure, and a touch of reality like ""Vinncennes Portal to the West"" I can't believe anyone would go to the exspense of making a movie from Black robe, and not about someone with flare such as George Rogers Clark. A book like Black Robe will some day come in handy if there is ever a paper shortage, I think you know what kind of paper I'm talking about!"
4,"Cute, fun, and girly","This is the same review I posted for the rainbow colored collar. What I expected-- a cute, fun, and girly party collar for my 10 month old puppy. She doesn't mind wearing the collar and the rhinestone ends add sparkle. Some of the rhinestones have fallen off, but I expected that. Only a few, not enough to affect the overall look of the collar. Overall, a recommended buy to dress up your girl dog. Too girly for a boy dog."
3,Book,The book just gives you general ideas on how you can make fishing lures and other fishing materials. I really wanted a detailed plan that came with templates I could directly copy off of and apply.
3,The INCOMPLETE Book of Tackle Making,"I ran a tackle making facility for three years, so I have a lot of insight into tackle production. I also have taught tackle making to kids at summer camp through the Fish Tech program.The book is ""complete"" in the sense that it touches on nearly every area of tackle production,, however it tends to take an over view approach to each area. There are a few well-thought-out suggestions and creative solutions to problems in this book. It's failings are the lack of specifics.One of the many areas I was disappointed with was the crankbait section. Here it encourages you to COPY an existing design, and doesn't give you the knowledge or tools to develop and create your own. There is no information about the hydrodynamics of lips and thier design or placement. Lure ballance isn't even talked about.I would recomend you add it to your library for reference, but only to get added suggestions after using another guide."
2,Incorrect Facts about Montenegrin Ethnic Background,"The historical and ethnic setting of the novel is at least disputable. Montenegrins have their own identity, and they call themselves Montenegrins, not Serbs similar as Austrians are not called Germans, and Scotsmen are not Englishmen.Ethnically, Montenegrins are similar to Serbs, but to put the sign of equality, even for the fiction, hurts the ethnic sentiments.Perhaps, it tells more about the source of historical facts Mr. Lawrence used than about his intentions to promote any view on Montenegrin ethnicity."
5,Roots - the next Generation,"My mother (she turned 90 on 1/4/02) and I recently re-watched this series, after we re-watched ROOTS. It/they meant much more to us now, looking back through 20+ years of our own experiences along with recent history. The casting was superb, as is the story, even though a lot of it was ugly. It evoked very strong emotions. The different time periods were recreated realistically. I was sorry that Alex Haley is no longer alive. I would have wanted to contact him. I can only hope that he was aware of the power and depth of the legacy he left. Such important works. Mama and I vowed anew to remove hate (ignorance) from our own lives and in our circles."
3,This is not as good as the original roots,"This isnt as captivating and as interesting as the Original Roots, I struggled to stay interested at certain parts of it. Sometimes I think they shouldnt have filmed The Next Generations and should have let it end with the original. Some parts of this seemes a bit too long winded with too many new characters to keep up with. The original with Kunta Kinte is the best and will forever remain a classic american story."
4,Bird Feeder,Great solution to feeding the birds. This product has now been in use over 2 years and still works great.
4,Works Well.,"This is the third 2 in 1 feeder that I have purchased. The only thing I've had an issue with is the plastic lid. It strips out the threads easily and will crack, making it useless. My birds love it though."
5,WOW,"This book pretty much has all the answers on every level in the current existence. It has the feel of unpolluted truth, especially if you skip the commentary half (which is very good by the way). It is not what it appears and simple interpretations will not do it justice. Pick it up in the different phases of your life see what new secrets you unmask."
3,Great B side,Worth it to the diehard Sisters fan for the hilarious B-side in which Herr Eldritch demonstrates his groupie techniques.
3,another negative,"To be fair, I've only gone through chapters 6-13. This book is probably an excellent review book for someone already well versed in mathmatics but as a text for undergrad classes it misses the mark. The author assumes a level of proficiency higher than the intended audience has generally attained. The book covers a lot of material and the explainations are are full of the jargon usually found in math texts. If in previous classes you only touched on a subject or perhaps completely bypassed it then this book will leave you unenlightened as the examples are sparse and are full of intuitive jumps that undergrad will most likely find difficult to follow. On the material better covered in previous classes refering back to those texts will be beneficial since they will probably go more into depth on the explainations and examples."
5,An excellent book!,This book is EXTREMELY well organized! I really appreciate how the author introduces each math topic with its prerequisites. An overall outstanding math reference!
2,Not worth the money,"Well, well...there are lots of people who say this is a ""GOLDMINE"" of knowledge, is Comprehensive, blah...blah...blah.This book, simply put, is not worth the money you need to pay for it. It tries to cover too much, and ends up being unable to do justice to anything . You can, however, use this as a reference text. It has something about everything, but when it comes to details, you need to go to some other text.""GRADED EXERCISES"". Well, they sure are, but most of the problems are far too simple, and almost all of the same kind. The author explains a problem, and then gives 20 probs, all of the same kind, but with slightly changed numerical info. So if that's what you want, go ahead, buy this book."
4,The Bible of Engineering Mathematics!,This is the book I used as a student and a graduate student and it is still the book I use as a reference book as a doctoral student! It is the complete reference textbook for any engineering mathematics student (and any student of applied mathematics). Though it is more difficult to use than Stroud (hence only 4 stars) it covers each topic in much more depth and also covers topics which Stroud does not even in his Advanced volume. I would recommend using Stroud first to learn the topic and then this book to master it. For the more advanced topics such as partial differential equations and advanced vector calculus this book is matchless. A must have reference book for any engineering/physical sciences student/researcher.
5,Wonderful,"I used Kreyszig's ""Advanced Engineering Mathematics"" and Thomas and Finney's ""Calculus and Analytic Geometry"" to cover most of the first year mathematics requirement of a physics undergrad. Both were fascinating and opened my eyes to how enjoyable and satisfying the study of mathematics can be. Both books and particularly Kreyszig's, require a strong background in high school Mathematics (a background which, I suspect from reading the American reader comments, is not provided by the American High School system). If a student is not adequately prepared, then of course they will struggle with this text. However, to blame Kreyszig's book is not the problem, but rather the system that left its students ill prepared to study it."
1,Quality that Doesn't Work,The cable was well built... Too Well Built. It seemed that the end connector on the 6 pin side was so well built that it had too much rubber on the end. It wouldn't allow the connector to fit properly in a normal firewire port. Luckily I bought the SIIG Firewire 800 9-6 Adapter. It worked perfectly. Fit into the MACbook Pro perfectly and instantly worked when I plugged my 1394a cable into it. I am very disappointed with the Cables to Go version. Sent it back for a refund within an hour.Buy the SIIG Firewire 800 9-6 Adapter and don't waste your time with Cables To Go 50704 3M IEEE-1394B Firewire 800 9-pin/6-pin Cable!!!!
2,The most faithful to the source,"This badly dated film is the most faithful adaptation of ""I Am Legend"", a short novel written by Richard Matheson.But, sadly, that does not make it the best. It does, however, make it more worthwhile than the waste of time with Will Smith, ""I Am Legend"" from 2007. That movie basically trashed everything good about Matheson's original story in favor of 'been there/done that' zombie nonsense.""The Last Man On Earth"" features a poorly cast Vincent Price (in a downright woeful performance) as the only survivor of a plague that has either killed everyone or turned them into vampires. Price is terrible in this film. He portrays Robert Morgan (Neville in the book) in the most one-dimensional way possible.In case you are wondering which adaptation is the best, it is ""The Omega Man"" starring the late great Charlton Heston."
4,A Classic Sci-Fi movie,"I saw this movie as a 7 year old & could not get it out of my head, when I saw The Omega Man in the Theater with my older brother I told him about the movie being about the same thing. Every since the advent of VHS I have been trying to locate this movie I will certainly get it and tell others about it."
3,"A classic, yet chilling B horror movie that won't let you go","This movie has been out of circulation for years now, and I am glad amazon.com has found it. I remember this movie from my childhood (c.1980) from the days before VCR's when local stations bought movies and showed them every couple of months late on a Friday Night Horror Theater. Ok, the movie is a B horror flick, but once you have seen it you can't forget it. Price's haunting narration , the story told in flashbacks, and the realistic possibilities of a world-wide plague pull you right into the story. The directing is very good for the genre and keeps the movie flowing. The best reason to watch this movie is that you just have to know how it ends--you'll never guess."
3,Cambodian jungle adventure,"This was set in the 1970s shortly after Pol Pot and his charming Khmer Rouge cohorts took over Cambodia. Casca is recruited by a Chinese family to rescue trapped members of their family deep in Cambodia's jungle. Hot on his heels is a Colonel intent on securing prestige by capturing the Americans and the story involves the rescuers being one step ahead of the chasers through much of the latter part.A one-off adventure story, I found some of the dialogue heavy going and the characters close to Casca too predictable and one-dimensional. The pace of the action was familiar Sadler and he felt much more at ease with the description of the environment, and you could clearly see he'd been there."
3,easy listening/inspirational,"Not to be stereotypical,but I was pleasantly surprised when I heard this.My first from them but not my last."
3,Not worth the price,"If I would have seen this item in person, then I would have laughed at the price and moved on - $20 would be more realistic. The pictures really aren't accurate to the color of red (since the two pictures were quite different) - it's definitely red, but a more subdued red. The color started to come off the piece when I wiped it down with a damp cloth. Not all of the silver posts are aligned quite right so they're at an angle. It also doesn't rest evenly on the counter, so I had to use museum putty to keep it from wobbling. The lack of decent packaging led to the item arriving scratched/dinged. From a distance it looks like what I'd been hoping for - especially now that it's filled. Would I purchase this again or recommend it? No. But I didn't send it back. Having looked back at this review I'm sort of surprised that I didn't."
4,Why did I wait so long,"Super product...had my eye on it for years and thought it would be too big with not enough to put into it. So glad I finally brought it . The only difficulty it that there is too much space for rings. Oh well, I guess I will consider that a buying opportunity. Everything is now at eye level which makes it easier to make selections...great for costume jewelry collections. Bracelets are harder to store because of their width."
4,best cargo box,"It was everything I thought it would be. Big cargo space and easy to move and handle on and off the car. Only down side, was the licence plate light is broken when i got it out... still working the problem."
5,Saved me from buying a Minivan!,With two dogs a wife and Child my 2003 Nissan Xterra was getting way too crowded on our road trips and it was either sell the most reliable vehicle I have ever owned and buy a Minivan or come up with another option. Thank God I found the THULE 684 it was like adding an additional trunk to my vehicle. I was fairly simple to put together and came with all the tools you need to put it together with the exception of the license plate holder. Once it's on you do not even notice that it's on the vehicle while driving and had no affect on my gas mileage since it's behind you and not dragging air on the roof.The only two cons are it can be hard to take off and on by yourself and it takes up a bit of space to store when not in use. Other than that I couldn't be happier with my purchase! I would also recommend buying from Amazon they had the lowest price and I also didn't have to pay tax or shipping.
4,Old Does Not Mean Generic,"So often, once people retire and age, they seem to become part of a great, gray mass. Younger people are known by their work, which is usually public. Old people become somehow anonymous, and that must be one of the greatest tragedies of growing old. This witty book illustrates nursing home residents as individuals who can only be known with patience and by observing their ""work."" The style is kind without a drop of sentiment. Nobody wants to be in a nursing home, and Kidder reminds of why, while reminding us that life, at all stages, is interesting, rewarding, and that all people, whatever their circumstances, experience happiness, grief, anger, frustration, and love. I listened to this book on my MP3 player, and didn't find its pace too slow, maybe because it simply felt like daily life. I felt compelled to create this review because I recently read ""The Sweet Bye and Bye"" which seemed too sugary and reminded me of how much I'd enjoyed Kidder's book."
3,Pretty good until the end,"Written in 1927, this book is one of the lesser known novels that deals with the life and times of mountain men. Personally, I was disappointed in the ending. The character turned out in a way that most (if not all) readers would never have guessed. I hesitate to tell more since I don't want to give the ending away. However, religion does a play a part. I wish I could write more but really don't want to ruin it for potential readers. But if you're like me, your religious views will influence how you feel about the ending."
4,A must for guitar players,"This CD is a great example of raw, old time guitar. It is hard to imagine the sounds the ""pickers"" were able to produce with less than quality instruments and rudimentary mechanical recording equipment. It is a pleasure just to listen and imagine yourself in this era. The selection of songs is good, a broad range of pickin styles.If there is a downside, some of the tracks appear to be a deriviation of the same song, but not to the point of being a distraction."
1,NOT A GOOD DEAL AT ALL.,"Folks, there is a good reason that these are so cheap; actually...come to think of it, there are several reasons for the low price.First: These are extremely small; not really large enough to get the job done.Second: These scrubbers are cheaply made. They come completely apart within a couple of days; indeed, a couple of pot scrubbings. They are almost completely worthless.Third: Before you order here, do be sure you check out the S&H; very, very carefully.Forth: There are quite a number of like products out there that are so very much better and only cost a wee bit more.It is truly a pity a product such as this ever saw the light of day. We bought some of these things a few months ago and it was truly a waste of money to say nothing of the frustration they caused.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"
4,Great Value,I shopped around and found no better case for my GSG-522SD rifle. Given the price this product is highly recommended if you plan on purchasing a collapsible butt stock.
5,As advertised,Well made and functional. Excellent value and useful for organizing tools (drills for example in main compartment and side compartments great for storing bits and drivers) as well as guns.
5,!!!,"This is some of the most beautiful music I've ever heard. Anywhere, anytime, with these tunes on your mobile audio device playing, secure the earphones and just close your eyes and follow the music to a beautiful place...enchanting!"
1,Very Confusing,The writer's way of telling the story was confusing .Like when Bee supposely sees jacky being mauled by a bear and then we find she imagine it.The book is very difficult to follow and at times very fustrating.For Me this was a very disappionting read
5,Leaf Genin vs. Sound Ninja Four,"The best out of the box series! Here is where I gain my respect for Shigamaru (sp?). Every battle was detailed and I like how they made ever character, even Chrojji seem so important! This set has more action than any of them, as they struggle and luck out some, in there quest to try to get Sasuke to return to the leaf!If your not a fan, and think Naruto is annoying as hell, then you should watch this set, because this is where he is most serious!Only thing I hate, is the communist price that Amazon.com has put on this series! Set 9 and 10 are the only one s worth this price! Come on Amazon, give me a break!"
5,naruto uncut box set nine,rhe disc are in excellent condition. There are no scrtches on the discs. The anime came before the date release. Thank you for the anime box set.
1,Sometimes I wish I wasn't a Bela Lugosi fan,"Bela Lugosi was a wonderful actor and he always put his heart into his performances, regardless of the film's quality. But there are times that I wish I wasn't a Lugosi fans, and one of those times ws when watching ""Murder by Television"". Apart from Lugosi, this movie has nothing going for it. It is dull, even at less than one hour, and the plot is completely uninteresting. And even Lugosi's performance isn't that interesting, since he's given no opportunity to show what he's capable of.Save your time and money. Re-watch one of his other movies instead. If you really need to see this movie, it's in the public domain and can be legally downloaded for free."
4,Enrique's Journey,Fascinating story about a boy of 15 leaving central america to find his mother in the United States with just a phone number on a piece of paper.The story coninues on after he finds her and the difficulity they have after re-uniteg was heartbreaking.The writing was not stellar but the story overcomes the writing.Well worth reading.
2,Enrique's LONG LONG LONG Journey,"I had to give up on this book as I felt like the author was just never able to advance the story beyond Enrique's multiple attempts at trying to enter the United States. Definitely compelling material but Ms. Nazario's inability to move the story along, in my opinion, left me feeling like the book was a really awful Groundhog Day that just kept playing over and over and over again. Maybe I'll try it again in a few months but definitely left feeling letdown that the book could not live up to what I thought would be a great piece of literature."
3,Tell me there is something better out there,"Okay, I am a stay at home mom who does not have time for a CPR class but would like to learn how. So you think a DVD like this would be perfect. First off it is a bit confusing and lengthy. They don't do a good job of teaching you in a way that you can remember. I actually think I have already forgot everything I learned from watching it. ALSO, I am not sure how current this type of CPR I learned is. I would recommend researching it a bit further than I did."
5,Gets to the point,"I thought this video was good. It gets to the point and lets you stop and rewatch things. I don't need lenghty explanations on how and why, I just want to know how to save a life if I need to. I am buying this for myself and my children's grandparents because I think the video is to the point enough to keep the grandparents interested in watching it all. Not too long and boring."
5,Precursor of things to come,"This, after ""1984,"" is my second-favorite Eurythmics album. None of the songs was a hit here, but give a listen to ""Take Me to Your Heart"" and ""Revenge"" (no relation to the later album of the same name) -- this album and a few singles off it could have been re-released after ""Sweet Dreams"" came out, to make it immediately clear that Eurythmics were not a one-hit wonder. Some synths, some sweet guitar work, and Clem Burke of Blondie on drums! Could you ask for anything more?It's a crime that this is only available as an import, but snap it up anyway to finish off your Eurythmics/Annie Lennox collection."
5,Sweet Starfire and Crystal Flame,Jayne Ann Krentz under any name is well worth buying. Each book is fun reading.A keeper to reccomend to one and all
1,Not Fragrance Free,"I have very sensitive skin and when I opened it the smell was very strong. I did not even try it on my skin since mine reacts to any type of fragrance, had to return it for that reason alone. But found a great alternative, from the Earth Science line, Clarifying cleansing lotion, Apricot night cream, Fragrance free moisturizing lotion etc. These products are a little cheaper and they are on Amazon, but if you look up the website for earth science, they offer FREE SHIPPING for orders over $25. Well worth trying. Or find the products at Fred Meyers."
2,Keeps freezing! Doesn't reconize camera's,Once the installation was done ; wich was easy!The hole thing worked good.Then the fun starts the next day when the computer is left alone all night..Minimize wilife to bottom of screen the day before then try to open it again the next day it opens right away but camera screens stays blank..You try to find my cameras again; one that is in the same room 12 feet away and it won't.. It ask if you to do diferent things to find it wich I try still no good..Finally uninstall the program completely then reinstall it and again works like a champ! Right away everything works well!!Next day same problem!Over and over again!You guys need to fix something on this one..Easy to install yes! Hard to keep going!Rob
2,"You can't ""realy"" view over the web:-(","Not worth the money.Very easy to install.Can't plug the cameras into a power strip or ups.You can't upload to ""your"" web site.You can only upload to ""their"" web site.This makes these cameras almost useless.Not a good picture quality.Great that the cameras are ""inside"" your home looking out of the window so they can not be messed with. Bad you can't up load the video to ""your own"" web site.If you have no desire to view your cameras over the web, and you don't need power strips or ups great buy.If you want to view your cameras over the web or need power strips don't buy these cameras."
5,a serious album that deserves eternal respect,"incredible album, honest, dark, open, willing, dwelling,haunting,sad,passionate,hard rocking. I will Never get over the opening track............................................"
5,Music to Break Up to,"Know how, when your relationship has gone sour, you look for just the right music to help you wallow in your misery and simultaneously climb up out of the muck onto your own two feet once again? How you're looking for just the right music to help you vent your anger -- at your ex-lover, for how he or she screwed you, and at yourself, for how you screwed up? This is that music. This is not punk, nor blues, nor grunge. This is catharsis. It cannot be compared to the Jayhawks or the Counting Crows (good God, no), as a previous reviewer tried to do. This is a unique band's catchy, loud, angry rock music. If you like Beggars Banquet-era Stones, or Tim/Let It Be-era Replacements, this album is for you. If you don't own it, you're missing out on something special."
3,It Does the Job...,"What more can you say about a sink stopper?! It does the job. These have a ""hollow"" underside and I prefer the ""solid"" stoppers as these have a slight taper to the sides and when pushed into the sink opening they don't really ""hold"" the way solid stoppers do."
5,Great disc for metal fans of '06,"I am deeply sorry I found the great price on Amazon after I bought the damn thing in a store, good lesson to be learned Amazon buyers! This is simply the most hard pounding disc of the year so far, there is a power metal-prog-thrash mix like none other on Mask of Anger. I am really impressed how this band manages to sound raw, but yet refined and crisp, great buy, pick it up!!!!!!"
4,"Formerly ""The Underground Wedding Book.""","First published in 1973, the 1984 version I read is still very 70's. However, it's also very practical and frugal. If the 1987 version was actually a serious revision, I'd suggest it for people who can't get their minds around an out-of-date planner.This book includes suggested themes to help pad your ceremony and reception when money can't, clever recipies (cheese and onion pie, a punch that reportedly tastes alcholic, etc.) and a general sense of fun that's missing from many modern planners.Hunt around for it. Its refreshing."
5,ATi X800XT AIW,"Amazon markets this card as pretty much a dedicated TV device. This card is a 3D monster. Look up this card or it's brother ""X800XT"", and you will see that these cards are beasts in the 3D realm. A whopping 2 cards are better for 3D gaming in my opinion. nVidia GeForce 6800 Ultra and ATi Radeon X850XT PE. But they also cost US$500. And they don't do all the nifty TV functions."
1,Been an ATI customer for many years but disappointed,I have always used ATI video products for all my very high end gaming systems. Usually I have retired cards after many years of service. This card worked fantastic for a month then after playing a game for several long hours (outputing to my HDTV and an LCD monitor) the card made a popping sound and shorted out. My power supply shut down my system. My system is ok and I am using my old ATI 9800 card again. The x800 lost two coils off the board and luckly the high end power supply I used in my system saved any further damage. Not a safe product.
5,High Quality Card to revive your AGP slot,"I bought this card to replace a 6600GT card in my Athlon 64 3200+ PC. I didn't want to change motherboards for a video upgrade, but I wanted some more frames out of my games - especially Everquest 2. So, what seemed to be the best deal for an AGP card was the AiW X800XT.I couldn't have been more impressed. What I thought was getting, was a small upgrade for my gaming experience. What I got, was a huge performance boost for my money. Frame rates jumped way over anything I got on a 6600GT. I am able to set my texture resolutions to maximum and enable features I never could before. Well worth the pricetag."
2,Cory Monteith,"The film begins well, the idea is good, but on the way the writer and director are lost.If the writer had tried to make a science fiction movie or a thriller and not a horror movie, would have a great storyacting.I only recommend to view Cory Monteith act"
3,LFC Live in Atlanta,I love this choir but like their later projects better than this one. I did like some of the songs on this recording.
4,A look at the dogs who run on the Iditarod,"This not a serious book, but shows the dogs at various stages of the Iditarod. Fantastic pictures of these dogs who are ready to run any time...Dogs of the Iditarod"
3,Aging & Addiction,I bought this for a friend who had a serious alcohol problem. Can't rate it as positive or negative as the person wouldn't read it.
1,Pallywood strikes again...,"This is yet another example of a completely biased view of the israeli/arab conflict. The movie claims that the wall is a barrier to peace and a land grab etc, it however does not mention the motivations for the barrier. There have been countless terrorist attacks into Israel over the past 40 years. The nature and extent of these attacks are gruesome and I dount any country faced with this on a daily basis would do anything less than build a wall (and probably do a lot more).Israel, just like any other sovereign country, has a right to defend itself and the wall is completely justified. There has never been a state of palestine and so the claims that this is a land grab are complete fabrications."
3,At least check it out,"I am a big fan of Philip Whalen's poetry, so I was very interested in this book, one of his few prose publications.It is rather interesting, yet the narrative constantly jumps around and nothing really seems to get resolved at the end. One can tell he is a poet making a foray into prose writing.It is certainly worth checking out, but it in no way compares to Whalen's wonderful poetry."
2,B-O-R-I-N-G,"I did not chose this book, it was required for a writer's workshop. When I sit down to read a detective novel I expect it to be about detecting. In The Devil Knows Your're Dead I was not the least bit interested in the personal issues / problems of the main character of this novel. The murder happens on page 17 of 316 and there is absolutely zero progress on solving the crime until about 231 pages into it. The intervening pages are mired in musings about alcoholism, transexuals, the morality of suicide, yada, yada, yada. B-o-r-i-n-g. I guess there is a market for this type of mystery (...) but give me Christie, Stout or Sayers and I'm happy. You can keep Block all to yourself."
4,White Boy Blues,"This disk consists of a series of remade blues songs. None have ever sounded quite like this. Most have smart, rocking arrangements that on first impression sound like Sam Coomes is dabbling, which sound better and better with repeated listening.The third cut, Black Cat Moan, takes the best of what made Led Zepplin great and squeezes it into three minutes of pure pleasure. It's my favorite new song in about a year.The album is kind of a new generation of white-boy blues but purer and with more emotion than you'll find with Jon Spencer (where it's a joke) or the White Stripes (where it's a pose). Plus the sax solo at the end of the disk is terrific."
3,a bit skimpy,"These ran right to fit the chair, but the sections were narrow, leaving a much bigger gap between the seat and the back."
3,Beware: No page numbers,"The book itself works very well as an e-book. It adjust so you don't have to scroll, you only flip pages. This creates a problem though. If your teacher wants citations or references page numbers, you are out of luck."
4,Buy the separate safety holder!,"As the Amazon.com review states, these people stupidly packaged the safety holder separately, which makes the price of this wave slicer look cheaper. Hence, 4 stars.Anyway, apart from that it's a great product, and easily slices to make wave fries or crinkles.Many mandolins do not include a wave blade, and they're way more expensive than this anyway, so if you're looking for crinkle cut fries or seomthing, this is the wave to go."
4,Good and Useful,"I bought this book to find recipes to use for a large weekend-long event and it was extremely useful. The recipes we tried all turned out great and were relatively easy to make, and people loved the food. It was like having Grandma in the kitchen!Everyone has their potluck favorite food that they've grown up eating or making, and this book contains variations of quite a few of them. I would have liked at least a few pictures, but I guess not having pictures keeps the price reasonable.I would definitely buy this book for my friends who cook, especially those who throw big parties or organize large events."
3,Fun In Film,"You have a couple of choices when viewing a ""light"" comedy like Amos & Andrew. Number one, you can watch the film and look for something that really sticks to your ribs (and not find just that), or, you can sit back for an hour and a half and have a little fun! I suggest you try the latter and have yourself a few genuine belly laughs! This movie is fun, well acted and a nice ride through the early ninetys attitude change on the race issues that are rapidly changing in todays vast movie field."
3,MMMMMMMMMM,"FOR A BRAND NEW BATTERY, IT DOES NOT SEEM TO LAST LONG. I BOUGHT IT CAUSE MY FORMER BATTERY WAS OVER USED AND IS AS POWERFULL AS THIS ONE. I WONDER IF THIS NEW BATTERY IS REFURBISHED?"
4,Prepare to have your heart touched.,"Kevin Costner portrays an escaped convict who, for all of his shortcomings, has not lost his sense of humanity and compassion. Taking a young boy hostage to prevent the boy from harm the two become inseperable. A convict who hated his father and a hostage who never had one, a relationship blossoms between them. A good date movie."
3,I've never cried so hard.,This movie is perfect for people who like a good cry. My boyfriend says I have a heart of stone because I don't get all teary eyed over sappy movies. This movie was different. I couldn't bring myself to see it more than once. The movie and these characters are so endearing that it draws you into their world. Sometimes the bad guys aren't all bad and sometimes the good guys aren't all good. The consequences of their mistakes are heart-breaking.
4,"Good acting, interesting plot, real sense of 1960's Texas",I could never understand all the excitement regarding Kevin Costner in his heyday but he is absolutely great in this movie. He manages to make an escaped convict both realistic and sympathetic. The child actor playing Phillip/Buzz is also wonderful. Clint Eastwood is Clint Eastwood and though I have never been a Laura Dern fan she does well in her role as a criminologist. The script is not perfect and the movie is over long but still compelling and very watchable. The movie is set on Halloween and the couple of days following in 1963 Texas. JFK's upcoming Dallas trip plays a small part in the film and helps anchor the setting firmly in the viewer's mind.
2,Dismal movie,"I'm surprised that others have reviewed this movie with high rankings. It's basically a mediocre movie, with not much of a story, nothing much that is enjoyable or uplifting, and some questionable content.For most of the movie, Kevin Costner's character is chain-smoking cigarettes, cussing, and generally being a bad influence in front of the young boy he takes hostage, as they travel across Texas evading the law and breaking the law together. There's nothing of value that comes out of this movie. I'm glad I only paid a small amount to rent it, and not blow more money and time in the theatre."
5,Dynomite,"This is as good as Jamaican Music gets, it skates from Reggae to Soul to Funk as if they were all the same. Also check 200%,300%and400%...all stellar! Great sound quality...a must for any Rock Steady,Soul, Funk or Reggae fan."
3,"Poor Substitute for ""The Hills""","I really wanted to like this series because Whitney was a favorite character of mine from ""The Hills"". The storyline of all fashion was just not compelling enough, and wasn't that believable. The characters were quite one-dimensional. It is watchable only because Whitney is a very sweet and good person, and you want her to succeed, but it isn't likely that such a sweet person would succeed in such a dog-eat-dog business of the fashion industry. Where are Heidi and Spencer when you need them?"
5,Borner Food Safety Holder,I purchased this safety holder as an extra incase the original one was damaged. It has a slightly different feel to it as I used it - it fits my smaller hands in a more comforatble manner without reducing its food holding capacity.
5,Absolutley Great Lens,"The Sigma 18-50 f/2.8 EX Macro is an absotuley great lens. Is it perfect? No. Is it as good as primes in the same range? No. But it is darn close to those primes. I have seen and used the Pentax 16-50 and if you need that little bit of added width from 18mm to 16mm, and you do not mind paying another $500.00 for it (and the silent focusing, but not any faster focusing), then buy the Pentax.This lens gives the photographer sharp photos throughout the range and a fast 2.8 to boot. F/4 and above give the sharpest photos, but even at 2.8 the photos are still very good. Well worth the money I paid for this lens. I would but again if I were to lose this lens or have it stolen (God forbid!).dwj2045Ventura, CA"
5,Second only to Grant,Excellent piece of literature. My wife is a direct relative of this man. A fitting way to honor such a genius!
4,Nilsson schmillson,"Buy this album for sheer variety. ""Without You"" ""Jump into the Fire"" and ""Coconut""...all different sounding songs. Of course there is ""Driving Along"" ""Early in the Morning"", and ""The Moonbeam song"". Richard Perry did an excellent job creating a wonderfully full sounding album. Harry Nilsson succeeds in being his own brand of music."
1,Not worth it. save your money.,"First, it is tiny, about 2 by 3 inches, making it hard to hold on to. It takes a long time to ""grate"" a clove of garlic on this and then it is just mush. But so muchy that it hsa no substance and you can't get enough of it together to actually use. I have turned to my microplane grater which works very well. (the micro plane grater can be used to grate lots of different things making it multipurpose)"
2,Disappointing garlic card,I found that it did not work. It was hard to keep the garlic clove in your hand and the end result was not garlic pulp or juice. It was difficult to get the finished product from the card.
1,This book is real bad!,"I am embarrassed that I did not look at this book long enough to recognize that the author knew nothing about NT and IIS before she started writing and almost nothing after she was finished. The publisher should be ashamed of releasing this book to the public. It is an example of greed. It was available to hit the shelves before nearly anything else on IIS 4.0 so those of us who needed to master the newest version of Information Server had little else to choose from when I bought it in April, 1998. Now I would say that absolutely every other book available is a better choice. I wonder what it feels like to offer something this bad to the public. I hope I never find out."
3,Very limited,"The good thing about this book is that it helps you to break the barrier between you and the things that you can do. This is the real point that I got out of this book. Otherwise, it is very limited in many ways. It is of much less value compared to ""Self Publishing, Writing and Marketing Your Own Books and Booklets"". The latter one gives you both the spirit and the knowledge required to get it done."
1,Returned because it did not work,I purchased this amplified phone for my hearing impaired father. The phone was returned because it did not work. The phone buzzed or hissed or did not work at all. Pushing the audio amplification button caused a loud buzz that might just cause hearing impairment rather then help it. I then purchased an amplified phone by Uniden that is working well.
3,Dark Short Stories,"This collection of short stories was surprisingly dark - well-written, but quite dark. Short stories are really not my favorite thing to read, and this was unfortunately no exception. Some of the stories were more engrossing than others - but those were frustrating, too because they left me wanting more... I guess it is the format that really disappointed me the most. I should probably stop trying out short story collections - the only one that hasn't been a disappointment was _Nocturnes_."
5,Quality that they don't make anymore,"It's actually strange to review a product that is no longer being manufactured. Hp would be bankrupt if they would have kept up the quality of this printer with their new products. Mine is TWELVE years old and used almost everyday for basic tasks. Making their (HP) money on ink these days, we are getting ripped off with coded cartridges and 'cartridge empty' messages and an average printer lifespan of about a couple of years. The HP DESKJET 840c is unbelievable durable and mine has also never required any repairs or such.Aside from working with all linux distros and up to windows xp, this printer has gigantic cartridges that usually last me around 1/2 to 3/4 of a year. No code no message and of course, I only buy generic ink.I love this machine so much, that last year bought another -brand new one- via 3rd party merchant in texas. Package was a bit faded but original and printer absolute pristine. I am a happy customer!"
5,Best of the early years,How this (vinyl) album rocked me through my college years. I believe I was the only one who had it in 1980. Mine has a different cover (scorpion on a woman's thigh). Scorps got no airplay then. This is a cult classic along with UFO's Strangers in the Night. Schenker Brothers Rock!
3,"Interesting, but confusing!","This book was very confusing for me at times. However, I felt so bad for the poor victim. I do not have multiple personalities, so perhaps that it why I had such a difficult time following the story. This book is certainly worth reading, nonetheless I gave it three stars due to confusion following the ""troops""( Trudi's personalities) dialogue."
2,She has amazing courage to write this but....,In my personal opinion this is not a healthy book for suvivors of childhood sexual abuse to read. Nor helpful to those with Dissociative Identity Disorder. I found the book to cause flashbacks and increase my PTSD symptoms. I had to stop reading the book. I admire her for putting her story out there...but this book was not for me.
3,This book left me blank........ what can i say?,"The book isn't terrible, but reading it right after ""Sybil"" (a fantastic book), i think, made it seem much worse than it probably is. It was definitely poorly written. By the time you finish a chapter, you're thinking, ""What was this chapter about again?"". This, in addition to poor transitions and terrible character introduction, definitely left me confused at times. I know... I know... it was written by ""the voices"" within Truddi Chase, but come on... why didn't anyone edit it?? Perhaps the manuscripts could have been rearranged in a manner that could make the story more easily understood. i don't know. In comparison to ""Sybil"", it was just boring. However, if you would like to learn about an unconventional case of dissociative identity disorder, I would recommend reading this book because Truddi's case is much different than that of Sybil, Billy Millligan or Eve's."
3,when rabbit howls,"I'm yet to read this book,the print is alittle small,and i dont think i'm yet ready to enter into this book as i feel it will be powerfully written,and with D.I.D. sometimes you have to take good care of yourself and i think this book will open more wounds than i'm ready for.but it will stay on my bookshelf waiting for my time when i'm ready to read it."
3,"Lady gets 5+ stars for her journey, book gets 3 stars","Kind of confusing to read and follow, there are many names and things going on and changing frequently. A glossary or guide of some sort may have helped. Interesting journey (and a sad one too) for this lady. I never knew about MPD before and learned a lot about it after reading this book. Some of the abusive things were hard to read and I was/am completely full of anger and rage at her abuser and people like him. Kudos to her for being strong, whether she had MPD or not!"
2,Falls flat,"Someone in my high school psychology class had read this book for a project and gave it a good review, so, five years later, I decided to give it a try out of the blue. And I really did give it a try. I read over 100 pages into the book, which I think gives a book more than a fair chance to grip the reader, but it didn't do it for me. The writing is confusing, albeit I tried to be patient with that because of the different Troop members talking. But the narrator kept alluding to something huge that never happened. It was always, ""she would learn about this in time."" A few times of building up suspense like that is fine, but it kept happening over and over again with little to no information revealed to the reader. I just got tired of it. Maybe someone with more patience with information being VERY slowly revealed will enjoy it, but it's not for me."
1,A Very Dull Howl,"The writing in Truddi Chase's book is almost unreadable. You would have to be awfully interested in how she perceives herself in order to follow the ins and outs of 92 alters, all reminiscent of made-for-television scripts. The book opens with a screen-play like reportage of a deeply significant conversation at which the author was not present - several such occur in the book. The author also mentions that her mother said she ""lies a lot."" It ends with her stuffing homegrown maggots up her putative abuser's nose and feeding him tapeworms (provenance not mentioned). In this environment, even though we are told that 20% of children are abused, her accusations of incest take on the character of those in the Salem witch trials. Also annoying is the author's insistent self praise -always in the third person - ""the woman"" -this tall, willowy blonde has achieved insights given to few mystics, is exceedingly articulate, etc., etc. Ugh."
2,Not as bad as Ten New Songs but close,"That's about all I can say about it. I've managed to listen through to the end (which I couldn't with TNS despite trying twice) but it left me cold. There are real instruments this time; but it's still essentially a poetry reading to a background accompaniment.I read with astonishment a reviewer of TNS, who suggested that the new stuff is as good as the old and that the first few albums were not LC's golden age. (S)he is so wrong. Admittedly, as a 17 year old when The Songs Of LC was released, my recollections of the album are inextricably bound up with Saturday evening parties and the mysteries that I discovered there. But anyone, who grew up with the early Cohen albums (up to and including New Skin I would suggest), will remember the impact they had and the feelings they aroused. I defy any teenager to make out to Dear Heather."
4,Beautiful!,"An experience that will totally fill your soul. Pure darkness althrough the CD, like a black rose...Don't miss it."
3,Not that bad...really,"Believe it or not, I found these at a local dollar store. They aren't as bad as I thought, but other people who think the sound is booming, lower your expectations NOW.Pros:- Good traveling headphones.- Fairly good sound suprisingly since they are earbuds and other bad reviews on Amazon.- Good carrying case.Cons:- Not so durable. One headphone broke and I had to buy a new pair.- Amazon's price is very high.Overall, these headphones derserve a try, but remember to 1) lower your expectations and 2) not buy them for...let's say... more than $5.00."
1,HORRIBLE!!!,I bought these headphones at a sam goody. I wasnt expceting an amazing sound but a descent one. When i plugged these into my cd player it sounded TERRIBLE!!! they sound extremly flat and no bass no treble no nothing. it was like i was listening to air i say that save some money and buy some sonys or spend all your money if u live in the L.A. area and leave a dollar so u can go to your local 99cent store and buy some that i guarantee will sound better and last longer.
2,"Too many breaks, not a continuous workout","I don't like this video. I thought it would be a good cardio and strength conditioning workout, but it isn't. My heartrate hardly increased, there were too many breaks, it wasn't a continuous workout...between each segment, they stop and pose and then move on to the next segment. They strength conditioning, and ab work is between two cardio segments...it's just not a good structured workout. I like the Bellydance Fitness for Beginners: Slim Down by the Belly Twins better...it's a continuous cardio workout that will increases my heartrate and has me breaking a sweat...although, I did buy this a while back on VHS; however, the DVD should be the same."
5,Antidote to Fancy Nancy,"Don't get me wrong....I find the Fancy Nancy books adorable, especially since my oldest granddaughter is definitely a little princess. That's why this book makes a good duo with the Fancy Nancy books. It provides a measure of ""all around girl"" to the Princess Craze. There's also one about kissing frogs and another about scraping knees."
2,Not for properly set up for Kindle/e-reader!,This is a cute book but I don't think anyone proofed the e-reader version. Some entire sentences are missing spaces - not useful for a new reader and the page sequence does not quite work. These are easy fixes. It seems like a computer is spitting out e-versions of books with no human proof reader.
4,A fun book!,"We bought several of the books in this series for our granddaughter. Lots of action on the pages, a fun read."
5,My two year old daughter's favorite book,"My daughter loves this book. The line or two of text per page is perfect for her, and she loves the illustrations. The second to last page is counting sheep, and she likes to try (I don't think there are actually 500, but she can't get past 20, so it's a moot point). The book has a great positive message too (though I don't think she's picked up on the vegetables are good part)."
1,extremely tiny rele not hppy with item,i thought this item would be near size or normal statue espcialy for such high price i was expecting much better instead i got tiny little statue that my necklace is even bigger than!
4,Through it all,"Been there, done that, as they say! I started reading the book and could not put it down until I finished---laughed so hard. I can identify with just about everything Cindy said--it's all true, and her honest, down to earth way of telling it is great. This is the perfect gift for friends who are out there in the working world. Cindy has a natural talent for combining humor with honesty, and I can't wait to read her next book!"
5,Wonderful writing,"Although I have not read the whole book, the stories in it are superb. They each have their own comical sense, but behind them there is a greater meaning. They reflect so much about Communist Russia, while being still enjoyable reading. A must."
2,Beware! 2 out of 13 episodes have been taken out!,"I am a fan of this series and when I found out that the DVD was out I immediately purchased it. Unfortunately, I was completely let down. There were way too many commercials and the 4 dvds only comprise of 11 hours as oppose to the 13 hours of the original series. The original series had 13 episode but the dvd version only has 11 episodes. They are missing episode 13 which is suppose to be titled ""Legacies"". This was an extremely important episode that should not have been taken out because it was the final conclusion. It's like watching a movie and missing the last showdown. There is also another episode that was taken out but I don't remember which one."
5,Buying books from Amazon.com,"I ordered 2 books from Amazon.com and was Amaz-ed at how quickly they arrived and in perfect condition! Have been back shopping for other items and have always been happily satisfied with everything I have ordered. Have full confidence that when I order I can expect nothing less than fast delivery and exact items ordered, no swapping out a 'like-item'. I am back again shopping for an item that is not available in stores locally, nor regionally. So glad that Amazon.com is there to put a me at ease in shopping in a virtual environment. Thank you."
4,Decent Book,"I like Jesse Gress's work. It's often simple and to the point. There are a lot of lick books out there to choose from and I think that this one is good because it provides not just licks but a variety of phasing options and rythmic patterns to try them on. This helps jump start you on adapting the lick to yourself. The only thing I don't like about this book is that it's not wire/coil bound. If you're gonna buy it, immediately take it out to and get it re-bound with wire or coil. It will make it much easier to work with."
4,awesome mouse but..,"I like the mouse, it gets the job done. I just hate the big antenna for the mouse it gets annoying wish i paid attention when buying."
3,"""wireless""?","the mouse itself has worked fine for me, i use it for my laptop. but i was expecting something WIRELESS. a friend of mine has a mouse that just has a stick-like receiver that plugs into the USB. this has a receiver as large as the mouse itself, and a long cord, so it's not really any better than your typical corded mouse. its actually like having a second mouse sitting around. it DOES work for me up to 6 feet away. i was only dissapointed because i was expecting a completely wireless mouse, but it was very cheap, so you get what you pay for!"
2,One blind mouse,"This mouse sucks! That is the nicest way I can put it. I would have given it 1 star, but it does technically work. I hate the way that it feels. I know that this is personal preference, but my husband and my daughter do also. It is hesitant to move around the screen, but the worst part is the scroll function. Maybe I should rephrase that and call it the scroll malfunction. It takes forever to get from the top to the bottom of the page and you have to keep clicking it. That is the most irritating part of using it. Mine had to be directly in front of the receiver in order to work right and for that you might as well get one with a cord. Basically this thing had to go. I replaced it with the Logitech MediaPlay Cordless Mouse and it is doing great. All of the features function perfectly. Take it from me, this one is not worth the trouble."
3,Slow shipping,"GREAT album. I love Jefferson Airplane and I just got a record player for Christmas so I bought tons of records and this was a necessity for my new collection. The reason for the missing stars is because the seller took FOREVER! I ordered it on Christmas eve and got express shipping. Now I realize UPS doesn't ship until later, but it was supposed to get here the 28th of December and it JUST came in today, January 2nd! Really aggravated about the because I wanted to listen to it a few days before I had to go back to school but I got cut short. GREAT ALBUM but awful seller..."
4,"Cedric and Lucy make a great, fun team","I enjoyed this movie, and I'm surprised this is getting such whack ratings. Cedric is a funny comic, and he pulls this one off very well. While it is somewhat predictable, it really isn't quite as predictable as most movies you see out these days. Who can really turn down a flick with Lucy Liu? It's a fun time, I'm surprised some people find this boring. Then again, I wasn't really anticipating an intellectually stimulating thriller. I was looking forward to a few good laughs, Lucy Liu, Cedric, and Lucy Liu...I wasn't disappointed."
3,Worth a rental,"You have to be a strong fan of comedy to buy it, but it is well worth a rental. Good acting, story, action, and effects. A black man has amnesia and wakes up next to a dead FBI agent and a quarter of a million dollars. He must figure out who he is, how the agent was killed, and what to do with the money. His flashbacks lead him to believe he is some type of special forces agent, but his waitress girlfriend tells him he is a janitor. Good adult entertainment."
5,Very insightful.,Reading this book has helped make nine very enjoyable. This series of books is great. Understanding the different stages takes out the frustration and makes watching and helping your childern grow and develop a JOY.
3,befor i buy i have a question,someone said it dosnt cock from the side then where is the action to cock it located and also is this worth it to buy?
3,pretty good gun,"this is an okay gun , ive had this gun for about a month and i dont know if its me but the hop-up doesnt really work on my gun i also dont know if its that all of these guns are like that or if its just my gun because when i shoot the gun the bb goes straight for about 20 ft. then after that the bb just dives in the ground. i think the best time to use this gun is at night with the laser and the LED light they work really well i prefer using this gun at night...but thats my opinion"
2,Too Much Set Up!,"I have been practicing yoga for several years and never in my life (pregnant or not) have I ever spent so much time with set up. There was no flow to this program, every position required folded blankets, bolsters, straps and no sooner was I in the position then the screen faded and moved to the next position with a chair placed over a sticky mat with two bolsters on it. My husband was scrambling to help me place the props and finally I was so fed up that I couldn't continue it! I have ordered a different prenatal DVD and hopefully I will have an easier time of it."
4,Great Music by Ernest Gold,"In 1960 some films featured music of great quality. One of them was ""TheAlamo"", soundtrack by Dimitri Tiomkin. The Academy of Motion Picture choosed ""Exodus"" for Best Original Score, and I agree. For the ""ExodusTheme"" is one of the most beautiful melody of all time. It received lyricsby singer Pat Boone and became a great success world around. Another trackthat deserves attention is ""Karen"" a tender theme for the character playedby Jill Haworth. Later she became, if I am right, the principal actressin Cabaret (stage version, before the film with Liza Minelli)."
5,The most hauntingly beautiful Theme Music EVER,The title tells it all for me. Once heard you will never forget it. Did not care too much for the movie itself - horribly miscast (with the exception of Paul Newman) - but the entire production was worth it for the music alone.Understand perfectly how Gold won the Oscar that year.
5,A SCI-FI ADVENTURE!,"I really love this movie, it's one of my favorites. It is a sci fi movie about a man who has to be put in a scientific experiment gone bad. This movie is very interesting the whole way through and I would reccomend it for anyone looking for a great time."
2,average film,though there are some moments this film is pretty predictable in spots. I just happen to catch it on the other night.there were some laughs here&there.
2,Kind of like a trip to the doctor's office...,The authors sterile approach to HTML made me think I was in a white-washed doctor's office. Everything the authors discuss seems to come at you in a droning monotone. Even the figures and examples become tiresome after a while (not much in the way of originality). A much better book on HTML (and everything else you need to know about web publishing) is William Stanek's Web Publishing Unleashed. Do yourself a favor and buy that book instead... Tia Whit
2,"Incomplete, poorly organized, with a terrible index","I expected this to be a solid reference of HTML 4.01. What I got was an incomplete guide, ambiguous attribute descriptions, an organization that requires one to constantly look in the index to find anything, and an index that gives multiple page references with no indication on which page an element is defined. This book provides neither guidelines on how to use HTML nor a reliable reference to its linguistic characteristics. Pass it by."
1,Mediocre footstool; Horrible ref book,The book is too thin to be a good footstool but that's just about the only useful use. The book is so far out of date it is surprising it is still in print. I wouldn't use it even if I got it free and I did. I recommend Liz Castro's HTML book.
3,good book... for a specific group,"This book is wordy and has partial script, just to demonstrate a concept of a keyword. i don't think a beginner could learn from it although it's very html detailed. it should only be used as a reference. impatient people who wants info straight to the point will find this book slow and frustrating, like me."
4,"A Good Coverage, but less example","The book shows a good, complete coverage on HTML 4, and its implementation on IE and Netscape. A very comphrensive guide which should go better if more example (especially color) are available.Good for intermediate which would like to learn further. This book is bit tough for beginner which need to scan at least 488 page to learn html."
5,"The HTML reference I reach for, but it's not for beginners","I have been using HTML: The Definitive Guide as my general HTML reference book since the first edition; it is the book I reach for when I want to check the use of some obscure tag or attribute.That being said, this is not a good, general introduction to Web page design. Rather, the book works best as a reference for those with a solid, intermediate knowledge of HTML who want to contextualize what they know and move on to the next step.This is a book about HTML, and it does not cover all aspects of making Web pages. Such things as DOM, DHTML and JavaScript are really beyond the scope of this book, and are covered in other, also excellent, O'Reilly publications.If one is serious about Web design then one needs to learn HTML and code it by hand; The Definitive Guide is an excellent resource for this."
2,Get Web Publishing Unleashed Professional instead,"For the money I found Web Publishing Unleashed Professional to be a better value. The book is thorough and enjoyable. Out of all the web books I have purchased in the last few years that book is the only one that I use regularly.As for HTML: The Definitive Guide, you definitely cannot say it is thorough and enjoyable. It is a reference book that is not entirely thorough and certainly not enjoyable to read. It is not a tutorial either. I bought the book but I never use it. It just gathers dust!"
2,As Good as Jefferson Starship Got,"As one of the earlier reviewers pointed out -- it ain't Jefferson Airplane. It is not even close. But, as far as Jefferson Starship goes, ""Red Octopus"" was as good as they got. For mid 70's arena rock, they were still better than most of the bands out there. If you want a Jefferson Starship album -- this is the one to get. Then do yourself a favor, get the old Airplane albums and find out what the real deal was."
4,Good album from old geezers,"Though they were still relatively young at the time of the recording of ""Red Octopus,"" the members of Jefferson Starship had already been recording in various guises for close to a decade. Giving up the adventurism of the former Jefferson Airplane, they went instead for a more pop oriented sound and largely succeeded. ""Miracles"" was a massive hit (the best the band ever produced), and other strong tracks like ""Fast Buck Freddie,"" ""Get Fiddler"" and ""Play on Love"" abound. In fact, Jefferson Starship would never again come close to being this good."
2,Red Herring: Dead Fish,"This is Grace Slick's worst effort in the studio, but listen to the cuts; maybe their for you. Nothing close to Surrealistic Pillow, et. al. but a nice round out if you've already purchased Freedom at Point Zero, Dragonfly and Modern Times."
1,The Album That Made Me Write Off Jefferson Starship!!!,"Man, I loved Jefferson Airplane. While ""Dragon Fly"" retained some of that spirit, Red Octopus was such a horrible sell out that I just wanted to puke. Need I say more? I really hated to see Paul Kantner get caught up this embarrassment. Luckily, he did exit some albums later."
3,Good Deal & Quality,so far it hasn't broken. I've had it for only a month. I very much doubt it will grind up ice cubes for slushies without seriously damaging the motor. Just mixing whey protein powder with skim milk seems to put a strain on the motor.
3,I guess it blends.,"I've owned this blender for about a month now and I'm still able to use it each day. So, every day i use this to make smoothies mainly with just frozen fruits and it sucks because it takes some time to break the ice. Be aware! Don't add too much at once or else it will stop and just lag the whole thing It sometimes makes this screeching noise and you will have to use a spoon to move the ice and frozen fruits around if its too crowded. I like that it is small and portable and also easy to clean but it doesn't have enough power to break everything and make everything smooth fast. I guess this blender is good for anyone that just like drinking smoothies daily and doesn't have a time limit. Be aware that its not very strong and only for single serve but its good enough for me since its pretty cheap and haven't broken down on me or anything."
5,Oh this sucker rocks!,"Got it to make protein shakes in my office. Works like a champ, drink from the blender, rinse, done. One shot blend."
5,Coolest appliance ever for me,"I had always wanted to make my own smoothies and since I only make it for myself, I have always hesitated in getting a big blender. After reading quite a few of the reviews, I figure it's only like $16, I would give it a try. I got my blender yesterday and I used it twice already and loving it. I put about 1/3 ice cubes and half an avocado, a cup of almond milk and some guava and the blender effortlessly blend them into the smoothies. It takes less than a min and it's really easy and it took the traveling cup with me to work so I can drink my breakfast on my way it. Way cool. Works really well for me."
5,Great little blender,"Works great. I haven't used it much yet but I did make a smoothie with it. And I mixed up a terrific salad dressing for my Christmas caesar salad. As some mentioned, you may have to use a spatula to push things down from the sides somewhat to get everything mixed but a small inconvenience. To clean it, you just put in a little dish detergent and some water and turn it on for a bit and it comes out clean as a whistle. My large blender will probably never come out the of cupboard again. I liked this so much I gave another to a friend for Xmas."
2,Taking Mine Back to Walmart,I bought mine at Walmart and paid about $9 for it but when I tried to make a salza with Romma tomatoes and onions it failed miserably. It might work good with just liquid ingredients but it does not work with vegetables at all.
1,broke after one month of daily use,"I used this blender for my son on a biomedical treatment. I bought two so i could one container and then use the other. The first container started leaking in less then a month of daily use. I ordered another from Hamilton Beach (worst customer service, sounds like they answer from there own house). I had to pay for shipping that was half of the original $12 I paid at Walmart. I got the second one in and the first night of use it starts leaking. I am return all to Walmart and I am going to get my shipping cost back. Horrible product. Dont have time for crap like this."
5,love this little thing!,It works great for quick shakes! I have even used ice and frozen fruit in it and just 'pulsed' it until the ice or fruit is crushed. Works great for me!
2,You get what you pay for...,"Read reviews of this item here on Amazon and decided to purchase it while at my local Walmart since they had it and it was cheap ($15.88). Well, you get what you pay for; the lid is cheaply constructed and doesn't fit tightly, also the ""travel lid"" which is the actual lid, has a slider to cover up the drinking hole, between both of these the lid leaks like a sieve. Also the blade is molded into the cup so if you take it with you and break it, you are out the cup and blade assembly not to mention you can use the thing if it's in the dishwasher. Overall the unit isn't very powerful, hardly creates a vortex when half full of plain water. Also in the instructions it says not to use with hot liquids or hard foods such as crackers, nuts, etc. This is going to be going back to Walmart in favor of the Tribest Mason Jar Personal Blender and Grinder here on Amazon. I only gave it two stars because it is cheap but you get what you pay for..."
2,OK Book for Practice Tests; no review,"This A.P. preparation book is not the best book I've ever seen. Unfortunately, I only purchased this book as a sole review shortly before the test and was disappointed. The practice tests in the back are great and there are four full example tests, therefore, I must give them some credit. Overall, would not recommend this book as a primary resource for studying."
2,"Good for practice tests, no review","I expected more out of the cliff notes ap us history book. Upon opening the covers of the book, There were key terms and definitions, HOWEVER, the review itself was not helpful (no real review)! The only reason that i could ever imagine why anyone would buy this book is for the 4 practice tests at the back of the book.Dont Buy this Book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!However, If you are an ambitious student and are hoping to earn a '5' on the exam, then listen to my advice..."
3,Made to rent,"It was one those movies that was ok, but it was an rental and not one go would pay to go see at the movies."
5,Futuristic Ambience Techno,The best so far from this Madrid based electronic music group. Mario and Coco perform outstanding sessions of the purest Madrid ambient techno. Sit back and enjoy the ride...
5,Bono Rocks (and the Queen's smokin' too!),"Bono is doing a great job bringing Africa into the spotlight. This is one of his latest attempts to draw more attention to the neediest continent on the planet. All in all it was a well done issue. As for this particular cover, I got it mainly in hopes of getting his autograph someday :)"
2,Poor Quality,"Ordered two 9542 dimmer switches. One switch worked OK, the second did not work. Tough to trouble shoot since it took a while to validate there was no issue with the wiring. Lucklily, I had ordered two and finally could test each switch in both locations and validate one of them worked ok, and the second did not. Not able to exhange via Amazon, only return and then go out and re-order another one."
3,somewhat helpful book,"The book helped me with a lot of simple words. However, some of my turkish friends who viewed the book found quite a few errors with words, spelling, meanings, etc..."
4,Sound Great,These sound great - no complaints except for the exposed speaker compnents. Could easily get damaged if kids or other users mess with your speakers.Sound great and look sharp in white and silver.Good range (bass and treble).
5,Great Speakers,"Everything about these speakers are great. I can turn the volume all the way up and there's no distortion. Subwoofer can shake the floor so much the people living downstairs feel it. Logitech really made an outstanding product. You won't be dissappointed, I wish I had ordered more."
4,Nice sat of speakers on sale,"Found this at a good bargain. Installed easily and works very well. Am not an audiophile, but this one has a good bass and a good range."
4,"Design of Sites: Patterns, Principles...Review",I purchased the book while participating in the remodeling of a client website. The book is formatted in such a way that you can review only sections that relate to your project or read for overall background on web design. Our team found it to be a useful tool.
3,Some of the music is great but some of it is very dated.,Some of the music is great but some of it is very dated. This album really marks the end of an era.
3,My favorite JA,"Not one of my favorites out of all the Jefferson Airplanes, However, one of their more unknowns I would recommend more, which is ""Bless Its Pointed Little Head"" after they became starship they lost there core hippie base if you ask me."
3,Not a good primer for the subject,"This book is very thorough in its content, and the information is laid out very nicely, and easy to find. However, from a non-information theorist perspective it is not a good introduction. It covers the theory very well, but is light on the practical application (which is what drew me to the subject). This book requires a solid foundation in probability."
2,"Few laughs, if any.","There's not much to say about this book except that all of it is written in the same style of "" Hey! im f-ing incredible ! i'm ready to tear this bar apart with my bare hands ! Do you think i'm joking ? I'm heroic in my own mind ! blah blah blah"" (that's not in the book but EXACTLY how every single part is written)To me anyone could have written this simple book. I think the ideas don't stretch as far as the sphincters who wrote it. It could have been detailed a lot more and made funnier with cruder observations. It seems to be written in an innocent way that can be absorbed by ""anyone"" so they could possibly cash in on the general masses . If you like cynical humor and are truly misanthropic this book really lacks anything laugh out loud worthy. Simple observations for simple minds. Waste of money for the most part."
4,So true,Great book and I found that I agreed with all the views on these people we all truly love to hate!
3,"Meh, kinda decent",Story a lot like the self gloating tales of Tucker Max but not nearly as entertaining but none the less I finished the book. 50/50
1,Letter Expansion Pack Not Compatible with Current Fridge Phonics Products,"Although advertised as compatible with ALL fridge phonics sets, I was dissapointed to open the expansion pack on my son's birthday and discover that the letters did not fit his fridge phonics word builder or magnetic alphabet set. A call to Leap Frog to try and resolve the problem was unsuccessful. The company does not seem to understand the meaning of the word ALL. They claim that the phonics products I have are new and the expansion pack is old therefore negating the compatibility. The packaging does not list any product age disclaimers. Luckily, Amazon accepted the return easily."
5,lowercase letters are important,"My children 5 & 3 both use the lowercase letters with the Word Whammer. Uppercase letters are everywhere, games, toys...but you hardly ever get you hands on lowercase letters & they are important.Anyway, the product is great! Very educational. Good to get ready for school.We LOVE LeapFrog products!!!!"
1,Beware! front wheel may rear up causing fall.,"My mother purchased this walker (from in town store). She loved it as it would get around in smaller apartment doors, etc. After a while, she got very comfortable with this walker and pushed down on the handles too much, the front wheel reared up causing her to fall and break her hip. I believe that this is a great walker, but extra caution MUST be used when using it. My brother was using it to get it from one place to another in the hospital. Not thinking, he put too much weight on it and the front wheel reared up with him. When she went into rehab, they would not allow her to use this walker and we had to get her another. Younger users would probably do great with this handy walker, but when the elderly are using it, they must be very, very careful."
4,Grrrr Marketing again,"I love Sharpe films. On the whole they have good plot and fine acting. My only Gripe is,When DVD's first came out here Sharpes Rifles was one of the first films avalible. Since then no more have been released untill now. But this means I have to order them from americaI say again Grrrrr"
2,Great adventures spoiled by poor transfer,"Whoa! What's going on? Have all these reviews been written by the publishers marketing department?These are great tv adventures. If you liked the Hornblower series you would like these but................unlike the Hornblower series these are poorly transferred, little better than below average VHS. A great shame."
3,stars of yesterday,"Tunnels was also released on video as Criminal Act. The picture is crisp, but the audio is fair with most of the dialog coming from one channel and music from the other. The plot is basically the story of two female reporters trying to blow the lid off of an underground slave labor trade. There is very little action in this movie, but does occasionally inject some humor. This was apparently made for TV. The highlight for me was getting to see some of my favorite veteran TV actors from the 70's and 80's. The movie has a decent plot, which moves kind of slow, but should not be classified under the horror genre. Only see this if you are feeling nostalgic and can't handle too much excitement. It's a decent way to waste some time on a Saturday afternoon."
5,Red Clay to Richmond is Right On,"I am not a historical scholar, but I do know a good book when I read one. I have read thousands of books about battles and wars and this is one of the best. Most books about war glamorize the battles and heroics. However, very few deal with the cold hard reality of battle and the personal events and emotions that soldiers must face. It is this unique perspective that makes Red Clay to Richmond so rich and compelling. John Fox has done a masterful job of researching the events through countless personal letters and historical battle records and then putting them in the context of the specific events and activities of the time. This is such a rich read - I couldn't put it down!"
3,Good but....,A good story but the broken sentences made the book annoying and distracting. It would have been much more enjoyable if written in regular prose.
3,"Haunting, then Hopelessly Obvious","It's fantasy, it's a mystery, it's a romance. Actually, The Seduction of Water has elements of all three, and while it began with a beatiful, even lyrical, tone, and the folktale woven into the novel was haunting and beautiful, about halfway through it became hopelessly obvious what was going to happen, and who people really were.It could have been an amazing story, with life parallelling a folktale, and the tale being woven into the novel within the novel. But I, at least, never really empathized with the main character, Iris. True, she's a bit older than I am, but she seems so wishy-washy, never standing up for herself. She falls into the mystery of her mother's past unwillingly, and seems to think solving it is more an obligation than a true quest for knowledge or peace.This novel could have been amazing. Instead, it's a great afternoon's entertainment, with some vivid scenery, and some nice language, but a flawed plot and characters that never truly breathe."
4,Important Insights in leadership,"""A Passion For Faithfulness"" by J. I. Packer is not an exegetical study of the book of Nehemiah. It is not a commentary either. What Packer discusses are a series of principles of leadership and church-building that Nehemiah can provide for the modern reader.Dr Packer provides for us many years of study and application of the principles that will change a person's approach to ministry. He discusses theology of the Church, Type and Typology, Background to Nehemiah, Prayer, Work, Battling Enemies, Management, Leadership, Call into Ministry, Covenant, Vision Casting and Obedience. All of this is done by Packer with wisdom and experinence couched in real life experiences he has been a part of.I highly recommend this book as a stand-alone study for the average Christian or in suppliment with Williamson, Fensham, and Kidner for the Teacher and Preacher."
1,Not worth 15 minutes,"This book is a huge disappointment. There is nothing new in it. The narrative is disjointed and starts with Yankee history, wanders over to President Carter, then back to Mayor Lindsay, adds a couple of cheap shots at other sportswriter (who Kahn objectively tells us are poor writers), knocks the Times, describes some mid-season games in excessive detail and continues on and on with bloated text, self-importance, self-righteousness without the semblance of structure, wit or storyline.The 1978 Yankees were a mess, but they were winners. This book, unfortunately, is just a mess."
2,It had potential.,"This book is good when the author sticks to the Yankees and his characters. Kahn comes off throughout as a petty, bitter, insecure man who has to constantly put himself in the story.Then there are bizarre and gratuitous cheapshots directed at other writers (his competitors),Kenneth Starr (whatever he had to do with the 78 Yanks), and others. In my opinion, the good parts of this book were somewhat tainted by the unnecessary cheapshots thatdidn't have anything to do with the storylines. It would have been a much better book if he took the high road and stuck to baseball and kept his personal vendettas against the Starr's and Schapp's (and others) out of the book. There is also a bit of revisionist history- he clearly has an agenda."
4,diverse,first i have to say that i don't listen to any sort of metal really. my introduction to linkin park was collision course (the cd they did with jay-z) i loved it and asked for this cd for my birthday.it took a while for me to get into it but now i love it. i love how catchy it is. my favorite song is faint because of the strings. i also love somewhere i belong and nobody's listening (the flute is amazing)you really have to listen to the album to get it. there is no filler.
4,LP freak,"Lp rox. no matter how much other people hate them, they will still have me as a fan. Hybrid theory the cd was better but I gotta give this cd street cred. they have the talent to mix in some different cultures with rock. Hybrid theory is only one small step above Meteora."
1,Ach!! This CD is not a bringer of hope!!,"I bought this CD in search of hope after Hilary Duff failed. I thought it would be nice, soft music to bring me hope after I ran away from my hometown. But ah, did I think wrong! This is extremely loud music. Do not buy this in search of hope.Sincerely,Thank YouP.S. I am putting my sister for sale. Two Cents. Good day. Godspeed."
5,Best album rock of the year,"This new Linkin Park release is following the rock-style of Hybrid Theory. The cool songs are: Don't stay, Somewhere i belong, Lyring from you, Easier to run, Numb, and the entire cd.Buy now! is really great!"
4,GREAT CD!,"heres a review for each songForeward-just an intro, nothin speacialDont Stay- one of my faves. its very good, the chorus is really cool.Somewhere I belong- a very good song but for the first single gets old so i usu. skip this onelying from you- interesting sound, its very goodhit the floor- cant explain it, but its fit to be in an action movie, its a school songEasier to run- okay i hate this song, im sorry but i think it sucksFaint- i love this song, the begining is kinda wierd. lol. but its an awesome songFigure.09- awesome song, its one of my favoritesbreaking the habit- ok songblah blah, the rest are good and i really love numb. i would reccomend this CD to anyone. u mite not like it @ first but it grows on ya!"
1,Tacky Nu-Metal pap milked again!,"Their mix of Lunatic Calm keeps that track sounding fresh again, it'll be interesting if that makes it to Spider-Man 2 trailers. Other than that sadly, it's just the same, PREDICTABLE pulp all over again. I find this band extremely insincere. I hope they and others like them, (and those who like them) go away and never come back. :D"
2,Not the worst CD ever...,"It really took me a long time to find something I liked about this album, but after a while, it grew on me, and while I doubt it'll ever grow on me to the point where I give it any more than 2 stars, it's got good points. It unfortunately suffers from an overreliance on programming and a stray away from the band's already-minimal metal influence, but somehow or other, they manage to pull the synth and guitars in enough to make a decent product. I can't really say it's an improvement over their first album; it's got more good songs but also more filler. Basically, the tracks on here are either good or garbage. Nothing great, but also nothing mediocre. Unfortunately, the bad outweighs the good, and there are some tracks that are almost entirely hip-hop. Hardcore Linkin Park lovers will probably like it, but if you just use LP for an easy-listening deal, then you might want to think twice before investing in this one."
1,What a Disappointment,"When Meteora came out, I went crazy. I was obsessed with this album. Linkin Park finally gave us some completely new songs after what -3 years? But over time I realised the truth. What did we get? An album repetative in song style, with teen-anst driven, watered down lyrics, and increddibly simple instumentals (especially the guitar). It's the start of a great band just losing it. Hybrid Theory an HTEP were always and still are some of my favorite albums but Meteora was just sad. It's the start of a once awesome hard rock band going into the MTV-pop genre. And now releasing singles such as Numb and Breaking The Habit is only going to bring more young fans who share their love of Linkin Park alongside their other favorite band; N'Sync."
3,Respect their effort,"You have the admire the effort that Linkin Park puts into their albums. Yes, Meteora does sound overly produced, one can say the vocals are timed too accurately, there is nothing raw about linkin park. Their lyrics are solid, they flow well and at time sound flawless with the melody. If you are looking for meaning in the lyrics, look else where, Linkin Park's meteora is targeted for 13-16 year olds. Besides all that, this album is enjoyable. You can listen to it from start to finish..when I first got it, I listened to it time after time. The best tracks are: Dont Stay, Somewhere I belong, Faint, From the inside, Session and Numb...As you can see there are plenty of great songs on this album...if you like radio-friendly music and like Hybrid Theory I would recomend you pick this album up."
4,Not better than Hybrid Theory,"this wasnt as good as hybrid theory because it had 2 much rap. But, This was a cool cd I listen to it now and then and it's just sumthin I like to listen 2. Favorite Track is 5 Hit the Floor it's a cool heavy song and i can play it on the guitar."
3,Monomania,"I like the music a lot. Thanks to my kid brother who bugged me to get it for him, since music is not part of my world and i tend to listen to whatever friends recommend. It surprised me because i don't normally enjoy songs that involve the vocalist screaming, either. The instrumental track's sort of interestingThat said, this album's monomanic. The songs all have the same theme: singer escaping from someone who's been controlling him. Kurang variety.(And if anyone feels like attacking my review for lack of insight, i freely admit that i know nothing about music. Totally word-oriented.)"
3,Wahahaha!,"It's a step down from hybrid theory but still good.Songs to check out-Faint,Figure.09,From the Inside, and Numb(the best song on this album)."
3,Meteora's tank is on E.,"Linkin Park, anyone? After a wildly successful debut album, the heir apparant to rap-rock's combustible formula is back with an LP for all the kids. And although Linkin Park's ""Hybrid Theory"" was lambasted by both purists and critics for not taking enough creative risks in it's production, the complaint seemed forgivable considering the fact that what the band did produce was good, enjoyable music. In ""Meteora"", Linkin Park restricts itself again, methodically allowing only tested, acceptable guitar riffs and chords to be played in their studio. The end result is a disappointingly poor second album, devoid of any creativity or original expression. The three stand-out songs are ""Lying From You"", ""Somewhere I Belong"", ""Faint"", and even these three are comparitively weak when heard against the stronger tracks of Hybrid Theory."
3,Meteora - Can it live up to the Hybrid Theory,"Listen, Hybrid Theory was by far one of the most significant productions released for the rock genre in a long time. It took leaps and bounds over the competition. Now that Meteora is released I have found musically that the cd contains the same great samples and lyrical content; one thing is missing. The length of the overall cd encompases roughly 36 minutes which falls short of even a ""short"" cd's length in general. Basically, Meteora is simply too short and does not leave the listener with a sense of completeness and Hybrid Theory did. Both of Linkin Park's cd's are musically fantastic, however, Meteora lacks the overall completeness that is severally required. They took two years to produce and record this cd, why in the world would they feel that 36 inutes is enough. Thank you for your time. Tampa represent."
3,Hybrid theory was much better,"This is just a rip-off from their first album Hybrid theory. HT had a new sound and every song was diverse enough to be good, but the songs on Meteora are either a rip-off of the HT ones or very uninspirated. Hope to see more original stuff in their next albums."
1,Perfect for slumber parties and bake sales,"Me and my Girlz love to get together and talk and dream about guys while listening to the Linkin boys. They are so HOT!!! And oh my are they talented, they really know how to play guitars!! The songs are SO hard to play. I have been playing guitar for 2 months and I can only play half of the songs, I can't figure out how they move their fingers so fast. Anyway I had the best time at our last slumber party listening to Meteora while painting toenails and eating cabbage rolls and cheese brodies"
4,What I think.,Ok I think that the CD is good But it's lame that you can not play it on your computer.
3,Garbage,You know I had high expectations for Meteora. I absolutely loved Hybrid Theory. I was very excited about Meteora. However after listening to the whole album. The songs are just plain horrible. This is another example of a band with a new album and only a few tracks are worthy of listening to. Everything else sounds the same which is a shame. Maybe next time Linkin Crap
1,Nope.,The first 20 seconds of Black Dog by Led Zeppelin blows Linkin Park's entire catalouge out of the water.
1,LIMP BIZKIT Suck or is this the other crap band,linkin Park are the 2nd worst band in history only beaten by the great crap bizkit. F**k rap metal listen to hard rock grunge or punk just not this crap. Do yourselves a favour go to a store Buy NIRVANA - NEVERMIND LED ZEPPEILIN - IV AC/DC - BACK IN BLACKif you want something newer buy Foo Fighters. You will never be the same again
1,You call this rock,"I will tell you LP fans like it is, this is not rock its not even rap. This is just techno with more words.If you want a REAL album get PANTERA,METALLICA,NIRVANA,ALICE IN CHAINS, OR DISTURBED.NOT THIS GARBAGE. All you Limp Bizkit Wannabes can't keep up with the words so u go to this pansy music if you want HIP HOP/Metal go get Rage Against the Machine."
2,Nu-Metal? More like spew metal!,"Ok..sorry about the title, but seriously, i can't listen to this band without feeling like running to the bathroom and letting it all out. The whiny voice is so anoying, i guarantee it will anoy the hell out of you. What anoys me is, that people think it is metal. i bet 50 % of the instruments aren't real. It just sounds so fake. The drums, guitars, and the bass isn't plugged in. Just so fake, and MTV-ish. They're even worse live..let's not go down that road. If you want good music, please don't go for this, please. There are plenty of better bands worth your money."
2,Formulaic.,"I really liked Hybrid Theory. It was fresh, it was original, and it was everything I liked in a CD. Meteora, however, was none of these. It was a great disappointment.Each song by itself is actually pretty good. But when you look at the CD as a whole, each song sounds incredibly similar. EVERY SINGLE SONG (except for the 13 second intro...why wasn't this just combined with the second song into one track?) has a sampled intro that soon ends with a heavy guitar riff. After that, it's mostly the same: Rapped verses and screamed choruses.Linkin Park's musical progression has been close to 0 in the almost 2 years since Hybrid Theory was released. It's clear that they'd rather stick with the Hybrid Theory album-selling formula rather than make interesting music."
3,Not their best,"I've heard the album. I was an avid fan of Hybrid Theory. But even that grew old rapidly. There were many problems with this CD. Most noticeably was that it was unbearably short. Some songs were good, others, bad. But overall it was a good album. If Linkin Park does anything good, it'd their fairly original way of intergrating rap and rock. Although it sounds a little overproduced.Bottom line: if liked the first one, you'll like this one. If you don't like sugar-coated rock with some mediocre rap that is bound to be discovered by MTV, the stay away.Also, maybe people should stop handing out 5-star ratings like Try AOL 8.0 discs."
4,Nice,"Even if it is lame as some people are saying, I enjoy hearing it. Something about it is very soothing. And they still sound like lil' boys. LOL You will feel younger while you listen."
1,even makes a crappy coaster,"linkin park. combining the worst of the worlds of ""rock"" and rap, i cant understand how they can brainwash people into buying their stuff. the vocals cant get any more emotionless, between the monotone rapping and the dull singing, you wont find any energy. needless to say the guitars absolutly suck, it seems like these guys are thrilled they can play a couple lame riffs. and seriously, what kind of band has like 20 people in it? yeah, spray paint is pretty cool. my brother likes spray paint. hes in 6th grade. linkin park is group of 30 year olds in a ""rock band."" enough said. if you want some rock, dont buy this cd, and if you want rap, dont buy this cd, and if you want a hybrid, definetly dont buy this cd. like i said, it even makes a crappy coaster."
3,not to bad,"I find it quite interesting to see all the reviews with people saying that LP are metal or hard rock. They are neither but they are an excellent angst rock band. Although LP is aimed at teens, a 22 y/o bloke like me can get a lot off. their not original, their not gods of metal but for what they do their is no other band that can beat them."
1,Same old same old...,"Haven't we heard this tune before? Rap, screams, guitar riffs so dreadful they are incomprehensible, and the drumming, terrible. The lyrics are plain and sound like a 15 year old would like them, but judging by all the ridiculous five star reviews on here, I guess that is the case. Every song seems to be about the same thing and the songs seem to lack the conciseness of hybrid theory, also the production is a step down from hybrid theory. Hybrid theory was a breath of life into a dying genre, this is just noise, pure noise, the mere sound is stale, i was really looking forward to this album. Linkin Park jumped on the rap metal train to late, they won't last long, but then again, i guess thats the only time they have a chance to be big, when the other monsters of the genre are taking the hint and evolving or fading away. take the hint LP, go away."
2,Missed the boat!!,"I like Linkin Park's first release. It was good, catchy, I could maybe believe the manufactured angst in the songs but all in all it was a good CD with many high points. Meteora just doesnt have the same spark that kicked me in the pants that their first one did. Sure the songs are more well crafted with keyboards and such but it seems to me that they dont have that same motivation. Where as the angst worked the first time around, this time I just dont believe it. Maybe it's their sudden rise to success, but one things for sure, Meteora is certainly a more commercially appealing radio-friendly CD. Too bad. I think it could have been much better."
1,GO Away!,"This music suckz, they suck, they cant play music or do anything, there music video consitsts of people standing around trying to look cool. I hate them, they shud stop now! There music is just plain crappy!You smell like cheese!!!"
1,What is This CRAP!!!!!!!,"First off, linkin park sucks!!!!! they are little posers who can't sing play guitar, drums, or turntables. It's disgusting to see these people rank #2 on someone's BEST BANDS OF ALL TIME!!If you want REAL music, go get a real rock album.The best bands in the world are listed below....go pick up 1 0f there albums:1. NIRVANA2. MetallicA3. KoRn4. Led Zeppelin- YES... Even 70's rock is better than this5. System of a Down6. Black Sabbath7. Pearl Jam8. Stone Temple Pilots9. Offspring10. Green Day"
2,"Chester, get a voice","Ugh. I won't spend much time on this review, simply because it isn't worth my time. Let's get a couple things straight : Linkin Park's biggest downfall is their vocals. Sure, they're arguably decent musicians, but if you can't sing, then what's the point? Chester's voice is scratchy and painful to listen to, and it totally butchers potentially good songs. It's the kind of voice where you know he hurts afterwards. That's probably why this album took so long to make, because after they recorded one song Chester most likely wasn't able to talk for the next two weeks.Anyway, the only reason I gave Meteora 2 stars is because of 'Faint', which would be a great song if not for Chester's nasty vocals, so it's only decent as it is.Do yourself a favor, save the 15 bucks, and go by Evanescence's Fallen instead, or even Avril Lavigne for crying out loud, it's better than this. Evanescence actually have someone who can sing, and beyond that too."
1,No Originality,"I've been a Linkin Park fan since the early days of Hybrid Theory and I just want to say this album is a carbon copy of Hybrid Theory.Don't Stay = One Step CloserEasier to Run = RunawaySomewhere I Belong = In the EndFaint sounds like something a bunch of pre-teens would be jumping around singing and the ""melody"" in Hit the Floor is just irritating. They could also work on their vocabulary a little more."
1,The Most Terrible Album From The Most Terrible Band,"Linkin Park is the embodiment of everything wrong with modern music today. The musicianship is nothing that any gang of angst-ridden teens couldn't throw together with the right equipment. The lyrical content is simply an unintellegent pity party. If you are thinking about purchasing this CD, it'd be a wise idea to reconsider. If you really like music letting out anger, frustration and sadness, get it intellegently and with some decent accompanying music, like Beck's ""Sea Changes""."
4,METEORA has hit...,"This title left me wondering when I first heard it. Named after a formation of rocks in Greece, ""Meteora"" is a wonderful sight to behold... as is this album. This is a big step past ""Hybrid Theory"", and was worth the wait the fans have gone through in order to get this album in their hands... The album has an edgier feel than Hyrbid Theory and Reanimation. This album is a welcome addition to any fans of rock and hip-hop. This is an amazing album and worth every penny you will pay. Although it isn't related to the music, the 40-page booklet enclosed with this album is absolutely amazing. If you loved Hybrid Theory, you've got to at least check this album out. You will not regret it..."
3,Big Hype Yet Same Sh**,Linkin Park has potencial to becoming great i think if they toned it down more and made some acoustic songs they would be more than just Linkin Park they would be unforgettable unfortunatly this c.d. doesnt quite deliver i heard all this on Hybrid Thoery it sounds the same but i still give credit to Linkin Park songs like Somewhere I Belong are great and songs like Faint are as good as well yet i feel they are getting a bit repetive
4,"Tak out the bogus rapping, and this might be the best ever.","Linkin Park has the tightest beats, no doubt about it. However, the emo rapping just destroys some amazing songs. I am a big fan of hip-hop, and let's be honest, Linkin Park is not rap. The little dweeby kid who talks about ""erasing his pain"" should be kicked out of the group so that people above the age of fifteen can also enjoy these ridiculously good beats. The guitars are sick. Amazing drum loops. Every track starts off being better than the next, but then here comes malibu's most wanted rapping about his painful existence. His existence is painful to my ears. Check out the song with no words, (I think it is eleven or twelve) that and numb are the two best songs on the cd because that moron doesn't get to ruin them. If there is a cd that is just the instrumentals, I would definitely get that instead."
2,Stunning melodies,"Lyrics & melody really make this CD upscale-the group has the potential to explode onto the charts. They can do that by losing the rap on all the tracks. This noise abrades the otherwise very fine tunes. ""Breaking the Rules"" demonstrates the really fine music Linkin can produce."
3,Not Bad...,"Not the best I've ever heard either. I'd give it more like 3.75 stars if I could. The cd trully is way too short to justify the cost. I actually thought something was wrong with my CD changer or the CD...Maybe if it were [cheaper]I'd give it an even 4 stars. Still one shy because the songs are decent, but the sound is familiar. Reminds me of many of the other singing/rapping bands..."
4,"Good, but not as good as Hybrid Theory","It took them 2 years to put out another 14 track CD that lasts 35 minutes, but it's an awesome 35 minutes. It's a little bit harder than Hybrid Theory, but it does have a soft and slower song. Over all, good CD!"
1,Meteocre,"Dear Linkin Park:Thank you for developing another mind knumbing talentless album such as your previous two realeases. Meteora, much like your other records, is void of anything creative or inspiring, or even remotely interesting. Meteora plays on the concept that radio LOVES sameness and uninteresting music, as do kids who dont understand the value of difference and the power of following your own path. Meteora is the XMen of music, lots of flashy stuff but offering little in talent or value. Perhaps most depressing, Meteora drains me of hope for any kind of heavy metal talent coming this year or any time soon, this fact enforced 100 fold by the fact heavy metal sellouts Metallica will be assisting in the sale of Meteora."
2,"Same crap as Hybrid Theory. Which, by the by, sucked as well","Linkin Park. How can I describe these guys? I'll do my best here ....""Whiney, corporate-created Top 40 pop-rock.""That about does it. Linkin Park is talentless. The only band member with some promise is Bennington. He actually has a decent voice. The rest of them blow. Simple power chords, simple drumming, simple bass, et cetera. Indescribably simple songwriting. I mean how many songs can a band write that goes Verse, Chorus, Verse, Chorus, Break, Chorus. Christ man. Learn to write something else. And for the love of God, please stop whining about how bad your relationships are, how no one loves you, how you can't go on, and so on.And to whoever is classifying this band as metal, please, educate yourself a little more thoroughly.By the way, the only reason this thing got 2 stars (and that's stretching it) is because of ""Lying From You."" I can actually tolerate that song."
1,N'SYNC with screaming.,"Ho - Hum I reviewed Hybrid Theory ( NO BASS, NO FEELING) and gave it 1 star. I would give this nothing if I could. I find it funny that this realesed about the same time as Deftones new album and all the teeny boppers and Backstreet Boys fans went out and bought this album instead of a good one. But hey I am not surprised, this is just a happy meal, mass marketed overplayed, overated, plastic junk. If you are 13 go out and buy it, who cares. AHHHH."
3,Better Than Hybrid Theory...,"To be fair, this album should get 3.5 stars or so. It's loaded with tracks (like ""From the Inside"" and ""Hit the Floor"") that are good dance tracks (or headbanging songs, whichever you prefer...) and ""Breaking the Habit"" and ""Faint"" are both catchy songs--the kind you get stuck in your head and listen to constantly for about a week and then never want to hear again. ""From the Inside"" is the only musically interesting song on the album. It puts Japanese flute music into a semi-hard-rock setting, which makes for a pretty unique feel.Basically, Meteora is a must for a Linkin Park fan, and a decent album in general, but there are better ways to spend your money..."
5,This aint CRAP!,"The ppl who are writting all crap about how Linkin Park is over rated are just lost. They dont know what they stand for! Anyway, intense music, good sound, rock on!Though, it is not better then Hybrid Theory!"
4,"Fairly good, actually","This was one of the first rock albums that I ever bought, I instantly loved it, it was hard, it was angry, it was everything a teenage boy could want. But then after a while of getting into better music and starting to play music of my own, I lost interest. It didn't seem near as interesting. But then I picked this cd up again and listened to it and actually thought that it was pretty good. Yes, the guitars sound the same for the most part and lyrics are kind of childish, but I like Chester's voice and I am a fan of using a dj, though i think Incubus does it better.Overall not a bad buy if you are able to look past a few things."
4,REALLY GOOD!,"Meteora is a real good heavy rap metal album...their debut HYBRID THEORY was a world hit, and this one brings other great songs like FAINT, SOMEWHERE I BELONG and HIT THE FLOOR...actually, all the songs are nice if you like rap with heavy guitARS...IT'S SAD THAT AFTER THIS THEY BECOME A EMO BAND ON mINUTES TO MIdNIGHT..."
4,linkin park is back and still very impressive,"This cd is exactly what i expected from lyrical genuises Linkin Park. Once again they grab you with incredible songs that grab you and have you begging for more. Like hybrid theory, every song on the cd is great. The cd could have been longer but i just find myself listening to the entire cd over and over again. ""Dont stay"", ""Lying from you"",and ""From the inside"" are easily the standout tracks but the entire cd will have you singing out loud enjoying every minute of this great band. Good job guys keep it up with the next album. I have already reserved it."
5,Wow....wow...wow....YEEEAAAAAA,true rap/metal...LP lives up to our expectations...mines...don't know about the other fans...but excellent sophmore album...keep it up Linkin Park...
2,Not Real Good,"This is a real electronic sounding band that has no guitar solos or good vocals. Infact they are not real good at all. All they have going for them is the lyrics, and they are getting old. They are so simular to the Hybrid theory. All of the songs sound genaric and not real fancy or hard to do. Its all in the synth. I cant say I love it, or even that its just OK. I owned it for years but I finally sold it, thank god."
4,Who doesn't like Linkin Park?,"Buy it. You'll like it because you like LP. It's quite a bit different from the first. It's got a lot of string samples and techno beats something not really found on the first. Could REALLY do without track 9. Very short is my biggest complaint. It's not a Hybrid Theory or even Reanimation, but it's LP..."
1,What the hell?,"1 star is too high for rating this cr@*, but unfortunately there isn't an option avaiable to give it 0 stars.It's incredible this music (can I call it so?) became popular.Every song by LP is repetitive. They play 3 powerchords over and over again, add some dull screaming to it and effects.Who listens to Linkin Park? Of course people with no good musical tastes. And those are mainly 10-years old kids who wanna be ""cool"". Oh, they may be a bit older. It means they just didn't grow up.Want to listen to some good, i mean GOOD rock music?Check out those...Led ZeppelinAerosmithQueenPink FloydCreamAC/DCGuns N' Roses... and many more! STOP LISTENING TO THIS ****!"
1,Lincin park all the way,"come on guys. why did you give this album a bad review? lincin park is the shiznig. they're so hardcore and in your face when they scream about how tough their lives are. any one who can't handle the screams and hardcore lyrics are stupid. yo guys, lincin park all the way"
1,"Not good, always sucked","I think linkin park is a very crap band on all of their cd's. Out of every song they wrote the only one that I think is at least a little bit good is the Breaking the Habit song and that is the only one, all of the other ones are mostly in a rap form. I hate it when people say that this band is a hard rock band when I would say it is a band for little girls that are under ten years old and have no example of what real rock is like. This band has childish lyrics for simple-minded people, I think bands that are actually good would have to be the black metal bands."
2,they're not angry anymore,Sounds like the angry young men grew up and reached their goals. All the rage and angst is gone - and so is the impact of their music. Blah. No offense to Hahn - but give it up and go back to the turntables.
2,Reanimate This,"So this is what happens when an artist is told they are great so often and they start to believe it. The result is Meteora. The first single is true-to-form Linkin Park with a great melody and hook. The second track is also pretty strong. Whatever happened to the rest of the album is a mystery. Perhaps Linkin Park should have taken a little longer in putting this album out to come up with some better material. The lyrics are completely cliche and uninspired whereas the first album had words that made you think. A CD with a run-time of 36 minutes is pretty poor as well. Linkin Park, if you are reading this: do a reanimation of this CD...it could only be an improvement."
1,a quote,"david cross once said, ""these guys sound like they stood outside of 7th grade girl gym locker rooms and wrote down what they overhear and put it in their music"" david, thank you for summing it up in an easy understanding way for all of us"
1,Linkin Park sucks,"Whiny vocals, pathetic rapping, same lyrics and riffs repeated all over, no creativity whatsoever. Phil Anselmo outscreams that whiny loser Chester Bennington, and Evan Seinfeld and Billy Graziadei can outrap that donkey boy lookalike Mike Shinoda anytime. You want REAL metal, listen to Biohazard, Machine Head, Pantera, Slayer, old Metallica, Sepultura, Soulfly, Superjoint Ritual, Chimaira, Down, Killswitch Engage, Shadows Fall, Children Of Bodom, Iron Maiden, Iced Earth, Mercyful Fate, King Diamond, Testament, Deicide, Cattle Decapitation, and Cannibal Corpse."
1,"dang diddly dang, they suck so much d*ck!!","man, these guys are the definition of suck. i wasn't even going to waste my time bashing them except for the encouragement of another LP-basher on this site who encouraged me to go ahead, let em have it. rap rock sux, nu-metal sux, so i guess combining the two is ultra suck? i dont know, but when i hear their whining singer and lack of instrumental capabilities on the radio (if someone else has the radio on, because i won't) i dont know whether to laugh or cry. long live michael romeo, death to these jokes."
5,Linkin hits one out of the Park,If you liked the first you'll love the second. No sophomore slump here!
3,Don't Try It,The writing is excellent. Ms.Brown makes a brilliant argument as to why you can have it all but if you sincerely try to do exactly as she reccomends you will be a burned out wreck. One of the best days of my life was the day I threw this book away.
5,John P. Kee is truly anoited,"I can do nothing but listen to the CD day in and day out. Each song holds a special place in my heart, they are my inspriration to press forward in the Lord. No matter what the problem the Lord will be there to pull me through. Thank you so much for allowing the Lord to work through you to be a inspriration to me."
4,Good Value for the Price,"Ordered this comforter set for my daughter. She loves it. It is a good value for the price. Sheets were a good fit for the mattress. If she loves purple, this is the set for her."
5,Moral Gestapo,What a hot cover. Pure genius. Of course small amerikan minds will find it offensive.....lol.......z
5,BELAFONTE AT HIS CALYPSO BEST,"now i have heard better calypso recordings, but this one will do just as well. i think that belafonte and the producers got the true feel of the islands on here. i would've liked to have heard more upbeat material, but i cannot deny the tropical feel of the album as a whole. this is an essential 50s album. what amazes about this album is how long it stayed at #1 on the album charts...........especially considering the fact that it was done during the early days of the rock 'n' roll era."
1,Too Ostentatious,"Too wordy. His sentences ramble on and on and on, changing subjects and stuffing in as many big words as he can. I had much more respect for him before I read the book. I am sure he has a lot of valuable insight to share I just wish he could get over himself so I could stop falling asleep throughout the book."
1,Silly,This book is poorly done. Spend your time reading something better. It was hard to even get through this but I did because I wanted to like it.
1,Total Fiction!!!,"The longer this two bit dictator stays in the oval office the more we learn about the man! There is just too much inconsistency in the book (aside from the drug use)which makes the readers head spin. His stepfather never fought the Dutch and was never a pow under the British. This is just one instance. There are several more. This whole book is a lie!!!!Oh yeah, if Amazon does not post this review so much for the First Amendment."
1,False Advertisement,"Do not buy from this seller. This product was advertised as a new book, but it was not. The seller claimed the book that I purchased to be a new copy, but it was not. Not only was my copy used but it also contains writing in the pages. The writing is that of a reader marking parts of several pages with pen and pencil. It also had sidenotes on some of the pages. This seller is not to be trusted or relied on. Also, the book is a re-print, don't beleive them."
5,Dreams from My Father,"A book I enjoyed immensely. My grandsons will read this book. Every fatherless boy of color should make this a ""must read:"""
5,We Did Overcome,"This book gives a foundation to understanding our next president. It is a remarkable testament to ""We shall overcome!"""
2,Book report on Dreams of My Father,"Purchased as I was curious about this guy and what kind of person he might really be, and the book was cheap. However this book made me very uneasy about having this man as our president."
2,"I admit, I struggled to get through it.","I bought the book because I really wanted to know our president. It was an ok read, but got very boring at times. I am glad I read it to truly understand his background, but not the greatest read."
2,Dreams from My Father,"Boring, amatuerish.However, the book reveals much of why Obama is such a liberal and pro entitlement programs."
2,A racist book,"Obviously, I only bought and read the book, because Mr. Obama is in the race to become the next President.The book is easy reading, the story he tells is interesting enough so you will not put the book away because you are bored. The father he searches for was a gifted man, who wasted his gifts, became an alcoholic and an abuse, yet is Mr. Obama's eyes, he had one redeeming quality - he was BLACK!The book is full of racism! Not the ""Red neck"" kind of dumb racism, but a more sophisticated one - YET STILL RACISM!After having read this book, it is easy to understand, why Mr. Obama had such a difficult time to separate himself from Reverend Wright - he simply believes the same racist agenda, Mr. Wright does!Being a German national, the question of who to vote for does not arise, but I certainly feel, those Americans who contemplate voting for Mr. Obama should read this book."
1,another version of the fascist pigs agenda,this is another exmple of the fascist pig barack hussein obamas socialist anticonstitutional manifestos. to quote one of the greatest men alive. my cold dead hands. thats where my guns will remain for life. we kill must barack remember obama we now have the power to dethrone dear leader within all of us we are the power that is now able to correct this mistake. my fellow patriots unite. uncle ted your awesome my favorite role model. keep preaching the word of truth an justice. the us constitution protects us we must use it now. rise up and overthrow this usurper. freedom. get this illegal alien out of office.
1,Dreams from My Father,"If people knew all these things about Obama, he would never have been voted as president of the United States. I believe everyone should read this book before the election in November 2012."
4,The Personal Side of Barack Obama,"When I purchased ""Dreams from My Father"" I was looking for more political firepower from the US Senator. At the time of my purchase I did not realize it was written over ten years ago.While the book fails to provide what I was looking for in making a selection in regard to the presidential elections, it did give excellent background to this accomplished man. Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) tells his story with such eloquence and passion, and provided excellent reading material.""The Audacity of Hope"" helps to solidify the Senator's political positions, but his storytelling technique makes ""Dreams from My Father"" the better of his two books and one of my personal favorites."
3,Beautifully Written,"This is a beautiful book.I wanted to learn more about his life as a law student, how and when he met his wife Michelle, and to see a photo or two of his extended family.But what really upset me is that Senator Obama puts teachers in the working class. Teachers are NOT in the working class!!!! Not only must they meet increasingly burdensome requirements (as if teachers are the source of every ill in the public school system), but they are required to earn master's degrees just to keep their licenses! And his state, Illinois, has some of the most burdensome requirements for teachers anywhere in the U.S. As an organizer who worked alongside teachers, I am really disappointed to see that he's one of those politicians who degrade teachers."
1,The entire book is fiction,"The content within this book has been proven untrue, this is not about Obama's family or his life. The girlfriend in the book doesn't even exist, the story having to do with the theater and they argument he said they had never happened. The magazine he claimed to have seen about the black man dyeing his skin out of shame was not true and the article doesn't even exist. From beginning to end the book is not about his life or his family, it is a collection of fairy tales and should not be taken seriously."
3,Who is Obama?,Anyone interested in knowing more about a person that may be our next president would benefit from reading his own written material. I do not think he is qualified to be president but I wanted to know the facts and skip the rumors.
5,Dreams from My Father,"This is the most extraordinary book I have read in years! It is a magnificent autobiography, beautifully written and absolutely fascinating! It should be required reading in every school in the nation, and I can't see any teenager procrastinating about reading it once he has read the very first page."
5,would be utterly fascinating even if he weren't president,I would have found this book utterly fascinating even if the author did not happen to be the President of the United States. Obama's quest to understand his rather complicated multicultural background and deal with the baggage that came along with it is vividly portrayed here in prose that are of a caliber one would expect of an acclaimed memoirist. The book is invaluable reading forThird Culture KidsandGlobal Nomads. It is also valuable for community organizers such as those who read Paul Loeb'sSoul of a Citizen. The book raises many deep questions regarding cultural and personal identity. It also provides a glimmering of the invincible aspect to Obama's personality that enabled him to rise up out of all the confusion and instability of his upbringing to become a world leader and a source of inspiration for millions.
1,Boring and not worth the shipping cost,"Talk about self-absorbed! Stuck in a self-centered identity crisis that he doesn't seem to grow out of, Obama let me down in this book and I couldn't force myself to read the last section. I ended up selling it at Half-Price Books."
5,Dreams from My Father....,A very well written book in Obama's own hand telling his life's story and how he arrived at some of his visions for America.
4,Insightful Portrait,"I thought this autobiography was a very insightful portrait of the President as a young man. I thought, given the groundswell of controversy surrounding him and his Tea Party perceived hatred of white people, it was revealing to see how conflicted about race Obama really was/is. I particularly enjoyed the fact that the book was written and published before he ever held office, so some of the less flattering details about his life were also on display without the benefit of a political spin team varnishing away the rougher edges."
1,Garbage,Does not work on the phone that I have. Claims it was defective but I believe it is just after market garbage from foreigners.
5,As expected,Left my charger behind on a trip; couldn't find one locally so I turned to Amazon. The charger worked just fine and the service was great.
2,PAINTED SKIN : THE RESURRECTION,The DVD played to about 3/4 than started to pause picture; finally played the last portion of DVD. Very poor recording due this flaw on the DVD. The movie if I could have seen the jumbled portion would have been a fine 'Chinese Movie'.
5,Alternadad,I can not count the number of times that these words made me smile. This was a wonderful story from what seems to be a guy that's got it together (whether he knows it or not). I definitely reccommend this book to anyone who needs a light read or anyone who's got the heavy burden of parenthood looming in the future. Kudos!! :)
1,"Fast Delivery, Poorly Made","We bought 3 of these quilts and they are already coming apart... 2 of them after I washed them and I thought maybe my washing machine was too rough with them, but we are using the 3rd one now and that one is starting to come apart as well with out being washed."
5,Goes with the Stock Market Course Book,This workbook should only be purchased if you buy the main book. It is designed to test your knowledge after reading the Stock Market Course book.Great idea. Helped me refine my knowledge.
5,Great for hiking,This product was great on the hiking trails and I had more than enough water to last the day.
2,Not a self study book,"If you are hoping to learn new strategies, this may not be the book for you. Though there are explanations given, the teaching is not detailed enough to teach someone who is not already familiar with the material. I do think that it would make an excellent question bank for someone who has a grasp of the material already but is looking to sharpen his/her skills."
4,A terrible movie with heart. Highly enjoyable.,"Robot Monster is one of the legendary so-bad-it's-good classic sci-fi B-movies. I have watched it twice and appreciated it more the second time, but my fiancee and the friend we watched it with both hated it. I guess you just have to appreciate bad science fiction in order to enjoy it. Yes, this movie is badly made. The special effects are terrible, the dialog is corny, and a 10 year old could come up with a more interesting plot. But the movie is actually quite good once you realize that the whole thing is in the kid's mind.This DVD has no special features at all except for a trailer. Although all the cover artwork is in color, the film itself is black and white. I found this DVD on Wal-Mart's website for significantly cheaper than Amazon has been selling it."
1,THE WORST EVER - A MUST-OWN MOVIE,"If you're a fan of really horrible movies, you cannot get any worse that Robot Monster. The plot is preposterous, and the acting is, by far, the worst I have ever seen in a commercial film. Supposedly it was produced for less than $16,000 but not a single penny seems to have made it on the screen. Even the hybrid gorilla with a diving helmet, was done because the costume shop had lost the head to the gorilla. The amazing part is that the music was composed by Academy-award winner Elmer Bernstein, who was the next-door neighbor to the producer-director Phil Tucker. Beyond belief."
4,There Is No Escape Hu-Mans!,"Classic example of a movie that's soooo bad it's good. I dare say, as much as I howled at ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"", this was even funnier! Between the cliched family cast, the oh so state-of-the art special effects (like when the orbiting platform gets blown up, the hand moving it thankfully was unharmed, and of course, that infernal bubble machine), the Ro-Man's dialogue has got to be the most hilariously classic textbook example you'll ever find of ""I will destroy all of you and rule the world"" silliness. The late great Elmer Bernstein provided an appropriately hokey sci-fi musical score just adding to its hilariousness. And of course, the completely arbitrary and bizarre cutting in of fighting dinosaur footage, WHAT WAS UP WITH THAT??Great fun if you need some popcorn and a good laugh!"
4,ROBOT MONSTERS AT 3AM FREAKED OUT,"I rember I saw RM late one night on tv.about 3 or 4 am.and good gawd ,it scard the bejeezus outta me!!watching big bear-type-bodys w/ tv's as heads.and also the ending.just thinking about if evernlate at night makes my flesh crawl.if you never hear or seen the movie,oder it ,when recieved watch it LATE AT NIGHT !!! IT'S MORE FUN .IF YOU DARE!!!!!"
3,not very good,It wasn't that great of a cd SAVE YOUR MONEY DONT BY IT!!!!!most of the songs where just insterments play really bad songs but there where a few songs that i liked but like i said before save you money and dont by it
5,Nice set,"Good quality, looks great, decent price. All you need for a cocktail party! I would have preferred the set without the ice bucket (not sure how necessary this will be) but it is a great gift for a guy - and it is hard to find good gifts for guys :-)"
5,If you catch me in the mood .....savage,"This remastering is as tight as the REVENGE release. It is thrilling and still shocking and gorgeous. The most fully realized album of Dave & Annie's partnership - it may be too sophisticated for the casual listener, however this is a masterpiece that deserves repetitive listening. It is frightening in it's unfathomable beauty. I recall when this came out and I was blown away listening to it on a cassette in my sony walkman - a lifetime ago. SAVAGE is still relevant today. A precurser to Annie's ""Diva"". True gem. Add to cart."
4,This is a machine for the classic espresso lover,I have had other espresso machines but none compared to this one for a classic espresso. Follow the directions very carefully and be especially careful that the frothing jet device does not get lost when cleaning the filter and basket. It is a shame that a spare is not included because it is such a small part. No problems with delivery and set up. The Gaggia met my expectations for a solid performer.
5,Fantastic.,"I bought this used and my husband could not wait to try it on Christmas morning.We were shocked that it did not work,the light do not come on,it was not getting any power.It looked perfect but we were disappointed to say the least.After investigating on the internet he found out out to remove the cover and located a wire that had become disconnected. I am not sure if that is why the product was listed as used or what?To make a long story short, he connected to wire and it worked and is working perfectly. We love the espresso it makes and seems like a luxury to have such great espresso whenever we want."
2,"Cool, but cheap","This could have been nice glasses, but they have been made so cheaply they are just not worth the price"
5,"Rugged, waterproof, and long lasting","I've tried 5 different kinds of lights on our dog when we walk him at night. This one works the best so far. It is light, powerful, rugged, and waterproof. It is better than the bike lights I'd been using as the batteries seem to last a lot longer and are easier to change. I'm also a scuba diver and they work great as tracking and emergency lights on night dives too."
3,okay read,"This book started off really good but couldn't keep the pace. It was interesting to see the love triangle byplay, but it also put the hero in a bad light because he looked like an idiot for being in love with the un-worthy other woman for most of the book. She seriously made him look like a fool. I see that some of my friends have this book on their cheating and rake shelves, but there were no cheating in this book and the hero was definitely not portrayed as a rake. The kiss that took place between him and the other woman was forced upon him by her. He was just an honorable man that was still in love with his ex, but in no way was he a rake or cheated. I guess if you count emotional cheating as infidelity, then yes he was guilty of that. It was my first DP and an ok read for me."
1,::yawn::,"This is the type of music you'll hear while walking around in K-mart, Target or any grocery store. Very dull and lifeless."
5,Their best,"The time apart must've helped; Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart have made the best album of their association together. In place of the sometimes tiresome histrionics Lennox would go into when singing in the past, you get vocals here that sound assured and full, brash when called for and moving and soulful the rest of the time. The songs are SONGS, thank goodness, and the arrangements take full sonic advantage of your ears without pummeling them into chutney. This is one of the best albums of 1999."
5,Eurythmics Best CD Ever!!!,"Eurythmics have created many excellent albums. This new album takes the best of Annie & Dave's talents in every way and creates a fantastic new recording!Great songwriting, Great production, and Annie's soulful voice make for perfection.This CD ranks not just as one of the best Eurythmics albums but as one of the best albums of this decade.And it's what this decade needed for a finale.Annie & Dave thank you for sharing with your fans!Mark"
1,"STUNNED, SHOCKED, AND UPSET! THIS IS TERRIBLE!","Oh, how I was waiting for this CD to come out....I have been a Eurythmics fan since the beginning ""Sweet Dreams"". ""Peace"" is a boring, dragged out CD. Obviously their worst yet. Everysong just runs like a slowwwwwwwwww boring song on Muzak. The only song that brings anything to the forefront is ""Power of the Meek"", otherwise this CD is just a pitiful shame....Annie Lennox stay on your own, you were doing fabulous.....A total disappointment."
3,The Nineties have not been kind....,"I don1t know where to begin.... I1m not entirely convinced that this is a Eurythmics album. It1s a good record - for a band releasing their debut, but we have come to expect so much more from the Eurythmics. Where is the magic of songs like There Must Be An Angel or Savage? A solid, well-produced effort - but a disappointment, none the less. Grows tiresome quickly."
4,beautifully conceived peice of work,"well, i just saw EURYTHMICS live in Sysney, Australia.and it was the BEST ever concert i've been too. PEACE is, as u all know by now, not filled with a lot of techno-driven pop tunes. instead, it's a warm, tender, angry, ironic look at life and is presented in a more subdued musical coating. annie's still a drama queen, and i love it. buy it NOW"
3,"Not their best, but still....","... an OK album. I got this album when it came out. The album is diverse, and kind of blends the Eurythmics sounds with Annie's solo sound. Songs like the gorgeous I Saved The World Today and I've Tried Everything sound like they could have been on Diva, and I Want It All and Power To The Meek have a We Too Are One feel to them. Still, it sounds dated now, and I never return to this album I must admit. Savage and In the Garden remain their best!"
4,A nice record,"There's nothing on here that's going to win them a new generation of fans but if you like the Eurythmics you'll enjoy this record. Annie's voice is probably stronger and more nuanced than its ever been. I was listening to my old Eurythmics tapes and realised that their albums were always 1/2 brilliant, 1/2 forgettable. This CD too is not brilliant but it is enjoyable. It is a good starting point if this band has indeed reformed for a second go-round."
4,niiice,"Slower than almost everything else they have done, but the songs are much more melodic and the most of the songs are much better written"
3,"Different, yet good","BLS is one of my favorite bands, Zakk is without question of of the greatest guitarists to ever live. Although this is not the best BLS album, it's still certainly enjoyable. This is more of a 3 1/2 out of 5 star album than a 3, I don't want to be hard on this album. While I enjoy Zakk's voice and his acoustic tunes, I took of one star because, while the 1st 3 tunes kick major ass and are downbeat and depressing, the rest of the album is more upbeat brings to mind a ho-down in rural Arkansas. They're not bad at all, I just enjoy the downbeat, mellower acoustic work. And I took off another star (or half star) because BLS is modern rocks most straight foward band. We now have to wait another year for a kick ass BLS album. But overall, good effort by Zakk, showing how versatile he really is."
2,Not the hard rocking album I was expecting!,"To each is own.... I guess. I heard some of the other B.L.S. stuff on the radio, and with Ozzfest in a few days, I finally decided to pick up one of his CDs. WOW! What a disappointment. I was ready to f#$cking rock and... NOPE! All the songs on this disc are slow, moody and pretty lame. I'm sure there are die hard fans who love this disc, but if your are a B.L.S. first timer...DO NOT BUY THIS DISC! I know, opinions are like blah blah blah.... That's just my 2 cents."
2,Weak album from a great band,"I don't mind athat the album is soft I just mind that it's not very good. Zakk isn't the best guy to be singing slower songs anyways, great guitarist but a crappy voice. I love other albums from BLS but this one was extremely disappointing. Crazy or High is one of their best songs ever and there's a few other decent ones but overall very boring album."
1,Not time release-INACCURATE PRODUCT TITLE!!!,"This is NOT a time release formulation. It is Nature's Bounty product no. 7900, and if you check on their web site you will see that it is not time release. I was not able to find ANY time release melatonin on the Nature's Bounty web site at the time of this review."
3,It is very good comedy movie,"India's underworld is ruled by Don Tony Fernandez and his brother Tiny. Tony decides that he has had enough, goes to confess in a Church, kills one of his men, and then gets himself killed via a car bomb. What the Indian authorities do not know is that Tony is alive and well, living in style in Bangkok, Thailand, along with Tiny. Then on a flight to Bangkok, a man named Dholakia, fearing that the plane is going crash, confesses to a priest that he is Tony, which is overheard by two sisters, Preeti and Piya Malhotra, who are headed to Bangkok to do a song and dance show. Tony kills the priest, and the police arrest the Malhotra sisters, and if found guilty, both will hang. But Tony is not taking any chances, he asks Tiny to ensure that the two sisters are killed. But hilarious chaos reigns when two former Bollywood stunt artistes, Pyare, and Mohan, intervene to save the Malhotra sisters. The only problem is that Pyare is blind..."
4,Thoughtful and Inspiring,"Another good book from Yancey. In Rumors of Another World, Yancey uses artful, thoughtful, contemplative language to show us what we are missing in nature, people, cultures,and sex.Some people may find Yancey's writing style laborious, however, I find it refreshing. The book is divided into 3 parts; What we are missing, signs of disorder, and two worlds. His chapter on designer sex is refreshing and thought provoking. I really enjoyed the numerous stories of people and his analogies. It impresses the reader to really open their eyes and see God.This is a good book to walk through the borderlands of belief. I enjoyed this book and Tim Keller's book, The Reason for God-Belief in the Age of Skepticism. The writing styles of these books are like left brain and right brain. Each book gives reasons for belief in God but they write about those reasons in completely different styles.Rumors of Another World is thought provoking and enjoyable."
4,A fresh look at Religion in today's world,"This book is a refreshing view on religion and our cultures in modern society. If your an Atheist, a Christian, or a Methodist, you will find some interesting information and a new point of view in this book. It is a no holds barred book for any type of person."
3,Still shedding,"These towels were nice and big and thick, but after many washes they are still shedding little fuzz balls everywhere. I find them in the bathtub, floor and on everything they are washed with."
2,Started unravelling almost immediately,I ordered these bath sheets and started using them. I immediately noticed threads floating around. I thought it was just left over strings. Then I found otherwise. These were the threads that sew the end part of the towel together. So half of that end cover part was already hanging off.They will still make a nice drying towel for when I wash my car.
4,"Good Quality, Good Value","I was quite happy with these bath sheets. They are nice and big, and very soft and absorbent. There was a bit of pilling after the first few washings, but nothing excessive. For the price they are a great deal. The color and detailing were just as pictured."
4,Well worth the money,"The bath sheet set, though not as plush as some other {much more expensive brands} is well worth its $9.99 price. Unfortunately, it and the bath towel/wash cloth set are no longer available at these prices, according to the current information on the Amazon.com website. My only qualms about the bath sheets involve quality control. While my set arrived in perfect condition, another set I purchased for a friend at the same time had many lose and overly large loops."
4,Fun,"I brought this product for my daughter christmas and i must say she loved it, and i think it is a very good product. When i attached the windshield at first it kept coming off but the thing is, you would have to force the windshield into the slot provided very hard and it won't come off again, cause ours haven't. The only reason I won't give it five, I don't think that everything is perfect just that I didn't have the problems like the others."
3,track,"It worked like it should and filled a need we had. Could not find it elsewhere.However, the postage cost as much as the item."
4,Loved it then and now.,I saw this film when it first came out in the early 70's with my wife in connecticut. We didn't know what we were getting into but this movie was great fun with non-stop good music and featured Richard Pryor and other great black performers.
4,Great 70's movie,"If you like ""that 70's show"" you should like this movie. It is a great 70's era movie. I consider it a comedy classic."
1,Don't waste your time,"This is perhaps one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Unless you like losing precious time in your life, don't bother with this movie."
1,"Great movie, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD","Carwash is a classic film in its own genre. However, the DVD version is cut. If you watch the Television broadcast version (Such as on BET: Black Entertainment Television) you will see the original scenes that were in the original theater version. For instance, the scene with Danny DeVito in a jealous rage with his wife is NOT on the DVD. Nor is: The Hooker watching the apology; the extended bus scene; and NOT EVEN THE TOUCHING ENDING WITH MARSHA (Melanie Mayron). I strongly encourage you to act on this DVD deciet by contacting Universal @ DVD Manufacturing 10 Universal City Plaza Universal City, CA 91601. You can't email them because they don't recognize Carwash in their online library. Another note; The ""Widescreen"" addition is NOT widescreen."
2,ugh!,This is one ugly top! I have never worn this and never will. The neckline is way too low for work and I hate the fabric which is some type of nylon more suited to underwear!
5,Great way to learn Access,"I am a VB programmer but I never used Acess before. I just picked up this book, and within 3 days I was building complex Access apps with SQL and all. The book skips all the BS and get straight to the point with what you need to know."
4,Prepares well,This book prepared me well for the AP exam so I would and did recommend it to friends. Cliffnotes makes a great study tip but be warned of the mistake in the court case review. It's Map Vs Ohio not Illinois. But that's the only draw back.
5,Great Study Tool!!!!,"I used this to self-study for the AP US Government exam. I know if I had read this book cover to cover, I would have excelled on the test. Still, the book was an enormous help to me. In the back of the book are the important Supreme Court cases and a glossary, among other things. I highly recommend this book! Good luck studying!"
5,DID MONTY PYTHON READ THIS???,"This book, like many of Harris's, is anthropological popcorn: It is delicious stuff that you can quickly devour. This collection of essays is very important and interesting. It includes his very influential expanation of the sacred cow in India, as well as analysis of European witchraft, cargo cults, and more. The most amazing thing in the book is his argument that Jesus was one of many messianic revolutionaries running around Israel during the Roman occupation. Read this section, and then watch ""The Life of Brian."" Monty Python got it right on the nose. The parallels are amazing, rival bands of revolutionaries all seeking a messianic figure...really great stuff."
4,Very Interesting Study of Culture,"This is a very interesting book. It explains some of the most strange traditions & habits of cultures other than and including our own. This book explains that all cultural traditions evolve from very real and material circumstances. Sacred Cows, Love/Hate of pigs, Military Messiahs, Witch Hunts, it's all here. At some points, however, the book does get self-righteous, especially when Harris just starts attacking the Counter-Culture and the New Age movements. Also, it doesn't really explain how or why the figure of the witch is making a ""comeback"" in today's society. But still, it's a very informative & entertaining book."
5,Second Decade,Love this... Michael W Smith is an incredible artist and a true worship leader. I so enjoy all his music
1,Horrible,I purchased 2 because of the good price BUT the one cartridge didn't even work/register with my computer and the other one worked with the printer but the ink wouldn't come out!!! So needless to say I am VERY frustrated!!! And I still can't print anything!!
5,great family game,must have if you or your little kids are into math. I let my 5 yr old do all the Math and he had a blast.hope they have something for multiplication and subtraction as well. will look it up in a few yrs.
5,What a wonderful game!,"Our son loves to learn using games so we've learned a lot about what makes a great game and what doesn't. A great game:. Sturdy in construction. Easy to set up.. Easy to understand instructions.. Capable of being modified as your child advances.. Teaches what is claims to teach.. Teaches without drudgery.This game scores 100% (got to get some math in there) on all counts.It is a simple, sturdy game which teaches kids through visualization (as the pieces move) and some competition. By purchasing a simple pair of dice with larger numbers, this game can be used to teach addition/subtraction with double digit numbers as well.A great deal!"
5,"Really educational, fun game","My 1st grader has struggled in Math all year long. I'm not going to say that this game has turned that around, because it hasn't, but it has got her doing Math willingly, albeit unknowingly! It's a lot of fun to play with her and see if she is picking up on addition and subtraction. A lot of games seem to wear off, as if the novelty of them goes away, pretty quickly. This one, however, is one that we play on a weekly basis and have since she got it for Christmas. Great for a kid that may have some issues in Math, or for kids that excel, as it can only boost their self confidence."
5,sum swamp review,"This is such a great game. I bought it for my grandchildren. It is so easy to play, and is understandable, without lots of directions. The 5 year old was playing and my youngest son (10) came up and decided he wanted to play. I thought it would be too young for him, but we both had a great time too. The 5 year old requests it every time he comes over. Great value, worth the money, and is a great fun learning product."
5,Great Game!,I purchased this game for my 5 yo grandson. We played it together and he really likes it. The board is sturdy as are the game pieces. And it's a great tool for teaching a child addition and subtraction.
4,"Good listening CD, also good for choral use.","I really like this CD. Particularly like Richard Smallwood's style. The music is quite diverse, from the more classical to upbeat gospel. Only disappointment is that the written score is not available at this time, which means I will have to put pen to paper if I want to do any of the songs with my choir. I have a pet peeve in that I feel that albums and CD's should not be released unless the music score is available. Not everyone has transcription skills even if formally trained."
5,Spiritual,Excellent music from an anointed musician. Excellent Christmas music. Had to learn several songs on this album for the Christmas concert at the church this year. Very exciting.
1,Does not relate to real test,I read and took the practice exams several times. To the point that I did not miss any of the questions. However the actual test questions were not even close. This was not a help.
1,Ugghhh!,"I bought this book about 5 weeks before taking this test. I studied it over and over almost every night a section at a time. I took the pretests and passed all of them with 60 or better. Well low and behold I went to take the CLEP exam today and failed. Almost all of the test was on child development and the book vaguely covered this material. DO NOT waste your money on this book, find another alternative if you can. Almost everyone that I have talked to that passed this test has said they did so by just having a psychology course. Of course this was not the case for me. Good luck on this test, it is a tough one!"
1,Music Professional from Spain,"Pretty young Dominican girl, it seems she won some contest so she decided to release a few albums ""De Pata Negra"", ""T.Q.M."" and ""Muevete"". It is unfortunate that she has neither the talent nor the voice to go very far. She certainly will never make it in Latino (or Spanish music), kind of funny because she tries to sing in Castellano in a few of her songs. Very few latino artists have succeeded in crossing over from Latino music to Spanish music and those who did succeed were already superstars like Shakira, Thalia, JLo and Ricardo Arjona. Perhaps she should try singing pop music in English where neither talent nor a voice is required, she could make it on her looks alone. Her sound tracks are quite good, if her band found another singer they could probably go far. I will give one star for her band."
4,Better than Rock n Roll Animal,"Oh Jim, Sad Song and Satellite of Love, as played here, are three of my fave tracks of all time. The twin guitars on Oh Jim are just incredible. Yes, it's a shame about the sound quality but if, like me, you grew up listening to a scratched second hand vinyl version maybe you're just grateful!"
3,gems amidst the clutter,"Most of the songs on this album aren't very exciting, but the few exceptions make it very worthwhile. ""Of A Dropping Pin"" is an undiscovered gem that sounds somewhat like fast-paced Moody Blues songs, ""Undun"" is generally considered by musicians to be one of this group's best, and I much prefer this alternative version of ""No Time"" because the strummed acoustic guitar chords are clearer, the guitar solo is extended, and the ending is more climactic than in the Top 40 version of early 1970."
4,Quite good.,"I haven't got that many guess who albums (3+2 best of albums), but I think this one beats American Woman. It carries a better variety of stuff, with a better version of No Time than on most other collections and American Woman itself. Key is a great song as well, with an amazing drum solo, longer than the song proper."
1,Destination Vegas,I have bought a number of Elvis products and this this the first one that was a huge disappointment. I would not recommend it. Sorry
5,Addictive,"This game was highly recommended by a family member, and it delivers--all ages enjoy this challenge! Warning: addictive to some."
4,Paco Rabanne XS,"I have been using this for sometime now and not only was the price great, (it is much cheaper than duty free stores), but the delivery was faster than promised."
3,Loved his other books but. . .,"This book is very good like his other ones, BUT he chose to use language that I consider foul several times in this book. I bought this book for my Mom and 3 other friends but am going to return them. Unfortunate because we considered buying in bulk and passing out to mothers at church on Mothers day. In my opinion he could have made his point quite clear using words that the average mother uses and want their children using."
4,A pretty good flick,"I love Emmy rossum in ""Shameless"" that's why I got this movie. I thought it was a good movie. Worth watching again."
5,A Great Direction,"This is Martin Scorsese's magisterial account of Dylan's early years. It includes extensive selections of previously unseen interviews with Dylan. Izzy Young is a real standout, though at least one of his pungent comments was cut from the film. Allen Ginsberg is characteristically perceptive.Some of the Newport footage has been superseded by the release of ""The Other Side of the Mirror,"" but there is a lot of exciting concert material here. Scorsese's real triumph is in the editing. He makes the story exciting and moving. There is a mass of material to work with, so that kind of achievement is extraordinarily difficult. Using Dylan's tour of England as a framing device, the film is a drama of the rise and emotional collapse of a great artist. The film, that is, is more than a document. It is a moving human drama.--Lawrence J. Epstein, author ofPolitical Folk Music in America from Its Origins to Bob Dylan"
5,What a great film,"I loved this movie! So much information, put together in such an interesting way. Martin Scorsese really gathered, and made, the perfect footage to tell about Bob Dylan's amazing life. And Dylan is a great interviewee. I was so entertained, I am just glad that it had two parts."
5,Gives you shivers,"What a scary experience this is, seeing Dylan's life as practically single train of thought, from the early days all the way to an early peak in his career. When you see what an elfin, vulnerable guy he really is it makes the story all the more amazing. He was no more ready to stand up to the onslaught of criticism than any of us, but somehow he withstood it and came out stronger. Dylan was a hero of mine before this; now even more so.Can Scorsese do no wrong? Take a look at Last Waltz if you haven't already. Dig Dylan in that snappy hat!"
4,Grade A+ for Scorsese . . . Grade F for Paramount,"Martin Scorsese gets an A+ for this excellent portrait of Bob Dylan's early years. The film also presents a unique historical view of the '40s, '50s and '60s music scene.Paramount Pictures gets an F for force feeding previews. Many DVDs allow you to press Menu and bypass the previews. Not this one! So every time you want to watch the film, you have to waste time with the previews first. I find this captive audience tactic a despicable marketing ploy."
5,Follow the drugs,"This movie is great & Bob is special. No doubt. So here's my problem. The movie wants me to believe that lots of people turned on Dylan just because he went electric. But if so, Bob was writing for an audience of total imbiciles - and what does that make him? No mention here of the new lyrics which were a little dark. And then we all had a big psychic crash, which hasn't ended yet. Blame Bob?"
2,Item received damaged,"I received this item BRAND NEW for Christmas and the tabby things that hold the DVD in place are broken. I'm going to try to get a new, undamaged copy, but we shall see...."
5,A New Direction Home,"Dylan has always been an elusive subject. Myth and fact cloaking him well on his long journey, and it seems the more we know the more complex the man becomes.In this 3 hour+ documentary Scorsese weaves a wonderful mixture of archival footage and interviews, with Dylan's insightful narrative, creating what is both an exploration of a career and a keen account of the 1960's music scene.No Direction Home helps explain the fascination with Dylan as visionary poet and prolific musician.Scorsese manages to convey Dylan's impact on the folk/rock/country/blues scene illustrating how his mastery of tradition fueled and informed the progress of the genre.It's a great in-depth look at a long and complicated career and it only covers up to 1966!!And in the process of telling Bob's rich tale Scorsese reveals, more than a little, of just how the 'star-maker machinery' turns a man into a myth."
4,Dylan Finds His Direction Home,"Bob Dylan - No Direction Home is a great DVD for anyone interested in creative process. For those who are unfamilar with Dylan it provides a fine summary of his early days in NYC and shows his impact on the music of the early 60's. For Dylan fans, it provides rare footage of the young Dylan and shows his struggle with the image that the media had created for him. As with all great artists Dylan had to find a way to be true to his muse while being thrust into the media spotlight. Unlike many before him, Dylan seems to have been successful."
3,Good writer but a little silly.,I'm a writer myself so I can be extremely picky--especially when it comes to romance. No faults found in the writer's talent itself. I just couldn't get into it. It felt contrived and silly--something a 13 year old me would have enjoyed more than the 35 year old me *shrug*
3,War from a woman's perspective,"Ms Givens writing is wonderful. Her characters are rich and her descriptions pull you into each setting, be they beautiful or barbaric. What makes this a unique find is that this gruesome tale of the barbarism of history's final Viking raids is told from a woman's perspective.It was simply too much for me. From the beginning to the end of the book was one horrible tragedy after another. For those who actually lived through these times I am certain the reality was far worse than even this book details. But the graphic descriptions of the terror and slaughter had my stomach rolling and my heart heavy."
1,Faulty machines and sellers,I ordered my first electronic organizer and was very disappointed that I couldn't get it synced with my computer. (and neither could any of my computer friends or anyone at handspring) Then it stopped holding data all together and I sent it back to the Richard Weize who has not refunded my money (it has been four months).
4,Great teaching tool,"I used this DVD for my Anatomy and Physiology class. It is a great tool to use as an opening discussion starter. It does not go into great detail but as an overview, it's great!"
5,Certainly puts me to sleep......,"This product definitely works as advertised.It certainly puts me to sleep.It helps me fall asleep within an hour taking it, and it helps me stay asleep.I only regret not using Melatonin earlier in my life to help me sleep.I would recommend that you give yourself at least 8 hours of time to sleep, before taking this product, because it will knock you out. You may also experience grogginess the next morning, as I do.But it's worth a try to see if it can help you sleep."
1,Too Much History,"I really found the Casca books entertaining and I was intrigued that Sadler was the author of these books. However, a few times he just went overboard on the history. This and THE MONGOL are two of the worst in that respect. There just isn`t enough Casca. All Sadler has done is stick Casca into the middle of a history lesson."
3,Try the New Cast Album,"After I saw a small revival of this show in a small theatre, I was determined to find the soundtrack or die trying. I had absolutely loved the show, loved the cast, loved the score. However, when listening to the score, you can see why the original cast flopped. The cast was far too young to play disappointed 40-year-olds, and was probably too young to even play the 25 year olds. Many of the best songs are heavily in need of the revision that was given to them (Rich and Happy, which was rewritten as That Frank years later), or just missing (Growing Up). The plot was also in need of the revision James Lapine would give it later. This is an interesting recording for anyone interested in the evolution of the show, however, as it has one song not included in the New Cast Recording (The Hills Of Tomorrow) which wasn't bad, and one can see how the show was rewritten. If you can get the New Cast Recording instead, please do."
3,Readable but strange and unsatisfying,"This is a very strange book. It begins in a world that has changed from ours: Europe and vicinity has changed from what we know to a strange jungle populated by plants and beasts never seen before on Earth. We join an expedition to explore this jungle, then suddenly are fast-forwarded billions of years into the future, where our distant descendants have created an archive of their history that is being corrupted by dark subsentients for their own survival. It becomes apparent that we're not on the real earth but are on the one in the archive that has been corrupted and that recovery is dependent on how the characters from this expedition behave. One first refuses to help, then finally has no choice about it. It's a strange, mindbending sort of story with a not altogether satisfactory conclusion."
3,Has been done better by others,"Intriguing premise, strong characters, weak conclusion. The best books have multiple climaxes throughout the story with interludes to develop character and build wonder. Unfortunately, this book doesn't create any tension or excitement in the reader.While there is a reasonable message built into the story . . . what it means to be human, the value of life and why it's worth living, etc., there isn't much support for that message during the book. It makes sense given what the main character has gone through but it isn't particularly powerful.If you want a book that combines a powerful concept, an interesting, sustainable alternate world and terrific suspense, try Holdstock's Mythago Wood."
3,"A good book, but not one of the ""great"" SF books.","The starting premise is relly interesting, but has lots of flaws. First, dealing with the omnipotent is too difficult for a novel... Everything gets trivial too soon. And there are lots of things that are simply ilogical (I will try to describe a few without spoiling the novel): what is the basic motivation for the ""ghosts""? if everything is virtual why the battles are so ""real""? why they did not use futuristic weapons, or simply a-bombs? RCW avoids writing a pure adventure novel (as it appears to be in the first chapters) to write somthing more deep, but at the end, he sacrifices again avery sign of coherence or logic to include a ""final battle"" that is too incredible... Not a bad novel, but it could have been much much better."
2,Could have been a lot better.,"I found this book to be very disappointing. The first hundred pages or so were great and really caught my attention despite the pretty skeletal plot and characterization. Once Wilson introduced the whole Noosphere idea, the book fell apart for me. It got super vague, disjointed, and ugly with regard to writing and I really doubt this was meant to parallel the lives of the undeveloped characters in the book. All in all, I can't say I'd ever recommend this book to anyone. It had its good moments, but really fell short of the award winning mentioned on the cover."
2,"Good Premise, Bad Book","This book started out with a good idea, but soon flopped. I was looking for an alternate history novel, but this is more science fiction than anything really. I like the fact that Wilson covers a wide range of history in this novel, so I gave it a higher rating than I would otherwise. The scope of the novel is it's only redeeming characteristic. If you wish to try this novel, I would recommend that you request it from your library, so in the likely event that you do not care for it, you may return it quickly."
1,....,"This book started out as being good. I started reading it and I thought it was going to be about some explorers trying to survive in a strange alien world. This is what the book started out like. Then it suddenly turned into stuff about alternate lives, gods, etc, etc. Just [not good]."
2,Use it if you can't find anything better.,"How should I start? The book makes no mention of the fact that the DAT is now completely computerized, there's basically no science review, and there's no difference b/n this book and the 1999, so the rip-off just gets re-packaged anually. I'd recommend getting an MCAT prep book for the science review, and some old DAT practice exams."
3,Fun but bulky,Our family truly enjoys the Rush Hour game and tried this one as well - it is bigger and bulkly and convenient for travel. I alos find the puzzles to be a bit easier. The pieces don't slide as well as Rush Hour.
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could,"First ex-president Hillary writes a book. Now its ""Slick Willie's"" turn. I checked this out of the library....do you really think I would filter out hard earned money for THEM?????Why would ANYONE???? I only checked it out because I was curious. Once a liar, always a liar. How does he account for all the mysterious 'deaths' that occurred while he was in office??? The WORST PRESIDENT THIS COUNTRY HAS EVER HAD. THE WORST BOOK IN THE HISTORY OF PUBLICATION, NEXT TO HIS WIFE'S DIABOLICAL TRAVESTY RELEASED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO! This man may have smooth talked a lot of ignorant, naive people. I may be ignorant and naive, but I'm not stupid enough to buy into all the lies and evil this man and his wife have done. They will someday be held accountable for all they have done. They won't make a penny off of me, that's for sure."
1,Boring and deluded,Bill Clinton's so-called life is nothing but cop-outs and an inability (even w/ghost writers) to make his book interesting. Save yourself this misery and read a good book...almost anything is better than this doorstop.
1,"Not Refreshing, Not Candid","Appears to be written more to sell books and, again, to milk the American people of money and attention, than as a literary work that produces anything of any consequence."
2,Style is too elementary for this genius,"Mr Clinton has had an interesting life.. this we already know. I frankly fell asleep many times reading this. Not because of the content, but because of his style of writing. I felt like it was targeting fifth-graders. I would give anything to have him back in the White House, but I was disappointed in his explanation of the whole Lewinsky scandal. He did his obligatory statement of accepting responsibility for his stupidity during that event, but he couldn't leave it at that.. he had to spend most of his energy on that topic blaming Ken Starr. If you want to read a better-written book on a Clinton, read Hillary's book ""Living History"", or better yet, wait for Chelsea to write a bio!"
5,Such a Pleasant Reminder,"I only recently finished reading this. What a pleasant reminder of a great time for America. He has always been a charming communicator and has a folksy way of speaking to his audience, not down to it. He touched on the highs and lows of his term, which took me back to a more simple time, so long ago those 10 years seem. As dreadful as his opposition was, Clinton offers forgiving words and makes the drama come right off the page. The current opposition to the current president somehow makes Gingrich and that group seem reasonable. Clinton gave us a great economy and victories in the Balkans. I'd like to thank him someday for his classy and strong leadership."
3,Interesting BUT TOO LONG,"While I found some of the book extremely interesting, wading through the names of every single person he ever met was tedious. He is obviously a talented polictican with the ability to push most of his agenda through a Republican House & Senate. His travels & dealings with foreign leaders were insightful- he was able to establish a rapport with all of them - and his desire for peace in the Middle East came through loud & clear. On the whole it's worth reading, but I must also say Hillary's book was better written - a real page turner."
3,I'm idealogical...,"Hi, I'm the idealogical american thoroughly ready to waste my time fighting the opposite of my ""beliefs"" to lend my life meaning. I haven't read this book, but if I had I would REACT to it. I love outdated cold war binaries. Yes, the political spectrum really is the maoists vs the free market utopias. The biggest indicator that our country is doing horribly is that this stupid bickering is what defines us right now...best of luck, keep putting Bill O' Reilly and Micheal Moore on the top. Gee, maybe we can debate the gay agenda(either side) because it really has made a huge impact on my life. PATHETIC"
5,Great!!!,"For those that really like and appreciate Bill Clinton will love this book. Many of the other reviews written say that he drops too many name; I like reading about all of those who had impacted his life, I was always curious about this. The book was not at all boring he brought up his past with current issues. GREAT READ!!!! Gosh I miss him, *sniff, sniff*."
4,Worth the effort,"This is an enormous book and very detailed - sometimes tedious with so much detail. But if you appreciate Bill Clinton as President, you will be very interested to learn so much about his history as a young man and politician in Arkansas. When you look at how little is getting done in Washington today with a President and Congress of the same party, you marvel to recall how much was accomplished when Bill Clinton was President and the Republicans were in control of Congress. This man is as complex a person as Lyndon Johnson, was very effective as Johnson was with his domestic agenda, and certainly did a better job with foreign policy than Johnson. He is also fairly candid about his public shortcomings, and thoughtful about how his weakensses and strengths are interwoven."
1,>> Clinton Needs Much Help >>,"Bad Title, Poorly edited and much too long (over 970pgs) for the content.The central attraction-Lewinski- seems a new/improved story.Publisher should not promote this as ""Clinton comes clean"" Mr President should've came clean UNDER OATH, in 98!I dont think this is a Tell all, as much as its a -Sell new.Theres good points but too few, the Foreign Affairs make great reading. And his Arkansas experiences give insight into the boy who would someday take the worlds most powerful office.The story about therapy/counsel offers relief to readers who find themselves worried for the man. I also wish President and Mrs Clinton would find the peace that good Christian living offers. Koodos to Hillary Rodam-Clinton for her strong position , as Solomon once said "" A Good wife, is better than riches."
3,A Politician's Story,"Was Clinton a great president and a bad man, a great president and a good man, a bad president and a bad man, a bad president and a good man, or all of these things to different people? This isn't a diplomatically correct story. It is Clinton's story in his own words. I was hoping for a more firm stand on actions - accountable without appology as Rikki Lee Travolta did with the classic ""My Fractured Life"" from which Clinton took the title for his memoir. Clinton never really captures that same voice that Travolta does though. His story is interesting, but it is still a politician's story as told by the politician himself."
1,Pathetic Revisionist History,"It is amazing how any brainwashed fools would buy this book, especially knowing that Mr Clinton was barred from practicing law, was impeached, and so thouroughly disgraced the office of the President of the United States through his sexcapades & lying to defend it. The book is full of cr@p."
2,The covers are too far apart,"What promised to be an interesting look into a contemporary president turned into a bloated and undisciplined collection of ramblings. Clinton could have well been one of our best presidents, yet he allowed his poor judgement to place him in positions that afforded his detractors ample targets for ridicule. Clinton could have written a book that offered insight to his political process but chose to recount the trivial and gloss over the essential."
3,missing 64 pages,this book was missing 64 pages so i could not start from the beginning. the rest of the book seemed pretty confusing because of this. i rated this 3 starts because i ordered 4 to 14 days and it came in about 3 days
2,Life Without Soul,"Perhaps what makes this book so fascinating is that these 900 pages comprise the historical according to Bill. Despite Dan Rather's enthusiasm, The Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant, this is not. I won't join the partisan cheerleaders and detractors among the reviewers here. I will say only that I was disappointed. My Life is a triumph of spin over substance. I have a recommendation. Read Chuck Pfarrer's WARRIOR SOUL, The Memoir of a Navy SEAL. Tell me which was the life better lived, and tell me who is the more honest man. Pfarrer was one of the servicemen who carried out Mr. Clinton's often contradictory foreign polices in hot spots all over the globe. (Remember Somalia? Remember Rwanda?) Chuck Pfarrer was a man who lived at the end of the spear, and Bill Clinton a man who lived by opinion polls. I can hardly wait for the movie. Pfarrer's movie."
1,Bill Clinton loves Bill Clinton,"As you read page after turgid page, the only insight you find is that this man really loves himself. If you like him you fall in line with his adoring FOBs, if you don't like him then you're part of the vast right-wing conspiracy out to ""get him.""And, if you're one of his Bimbo Eruptions, he'll only mention you when he's caught with you--and cast blame on everyone else. What a bright, cheerful disgrace.How did this man get to be president? How can people still fawn over him?"
1,"Bad Book, Great Cover Shot","This book is so dull and boring, but the cover shot of Clinton is terrific, he looks so handsome. I guess that's all that really matters -- the picture."
4,Better than I thought.,"I really enjoyed the first part of this book,which rebukes the notion that he was born of a privledged class. But the second half sounded like a bunch of stump speeches about ""The environment, education and welfare."" His perspectives on the Supreme Court decisions Gore v. Bush was interesting."
4,You Have to Read it in the Right Frame of Mind,"Don't read this book as if it were a history book or even an autobiolgraphy. You will go crazy as Bill prattles on about Elvis movies he has seen and play by play descriptions of Arkansas/Texas football games. Pretend, instead, that it is a hot summer night in Arkansas and Bill has invited you to his place. You are rocking away on his front porch nursing many drinks while he talks to you. Once I got into that mode, I really started to enjoy this book."
4,Veronica Diaz-Martino,"In his book, Bill Clinton tells us many stories about his life, particularly, his moving account of the period before the public life. True to form, the former president is charming and infuriating, with some half truths and omissions and always accommodating and aiming to please."
1,Self-serving junk,"This book is a complete waste of time to read. It offers no new information not available elsewhere and Clinton admits or describes nothing new about his sins and foibles. Its mostly a rant against Ken Starr. He doesn't even really describe Hillary very much. He is in love with himself though, that's obvious. I want the hours I spent reading this insufferable tripe back. Take my advice, DON'T buy this book, mine is now residing as a doorstop."
5,Must reading for any patriot,"What a relief and a revelation to encounter once again a president who is intelligent, literate, self-analytical, and profound. Listening to Pres. Clinton read his book on audiotape is a mesmerizing experience, one I highly recommend to anyone who has a patriotic concern for the dangerous direction this country is now taking under the current president. The chapters on his childhood and youth are particularly affecting and well-composed. In addition, Clinton is a surprisingly effecting reader, capturing the moment with his tone and modulating his voice to create a most beguiling word picture. Highly recommended."
3,"Could have been better, but...","This work is basically a standard work of political biography, a bit more open than some, but basically a postive reflection on a long political life, punctuated by descriptions of failures, in both politics and judgement. I doubt any political autobiography, Republican or Democrat, will be less than positive about its subject.As an earlier reviewer noted, it is not as good as Grant's autobiography, but he had Mark Twain to help. I did also not the omission of a better discussion of Somalia, and I would have liked to have seen more discussion on political strategies and NAFTA, industry and unions as well.What is disappointing are the reviewers that cannot separate hatred from a book review, or that mention claims with no substantiation. Review the book, not the person. If you point to an error in the book, substantiate it. Empty talk is just that. Otherwise apply for Novak's now empty talking head seat."
2,Charisma Doesn't Come Thru,"Clinton was a good President and leader because of his incredible charisma. It doesn't come thru in this book at all. He's also not much of a writer or at least the ghostwriter he used (if he used one), isn't. (Maybe Clinton went cheap on who he used because he was saving his money for possible legal issues.) I like Clinton alot, just not this book. I agree that he should talk more about his mistakes. In fact, that's part of what makes him charismatic when he speaks; he talks about making mistakes, he seems real, not someone trying to present himself as all-knowing, like Bush. Maybe Bush wrote this book. It seems like he could have."
2,Typical Clinton,I was anxious to read this book - - BUT it's just typical Clinton-ese: long-winded and vain-speaking. Don't bother.
1,too bad,It is really too bad that most people work so hard each and every day for whatever they earn and then there are people who sucessfully crap all over the office of the US Presidency and make millions telling how he got away with it. Not to mention you all are eager to eat it up.
3,Way Too Long!!,"As much as I like Bill Clinton- this book was WAY too long! I thought the structure of the book would have been different. It was ALL about politics. I mean, in the beginning it told about his background but I feel that most of the book is pretty much boring."
2,Der Schlickmeister Strikes Again!,"I guess if you're a Left wing Liberal Democrat (I'm not) you'll probably lap up everything this twisted, sick individual did (or didn't) write about.Is there anything really new in this book? As far as I'm concerned, there isn't. It's just more of ""Himself"" being himself as narsacistic as ever (Ron Burgandy aka Will Farrell, move over).This book reminds me of an irritating neighbour you're trying to forget but can't because he just won't go away! $30 wasted except for the fact that I read the book so I have the right to comment.Clinton's next book will likely be ""My Next Life"" (husband of the President)."
2,"Good narrative, so-so story","Clinton reads well, with inflection, but the story just doesn't hold my interest and was incomplete. Why was the part about Somalia cut out, for instance?"
3,"An incredible life story, told without brevity","There is little doubt that the story of the former president's life is an incredible, often inspiring, one. Born to a widowed mother in Arkansas, Clinton fights his personal demons, which include his stepfather's alcoholism and physical abuse of his mother and younger brother. His public face reveals little, if any, of the inner turmoil, as he uses his many gifts to become a leader.The mistake of this book is asking the reader to wade through some 1,000 pages. While the book is well enough written, so much of it is anecdotal and seemingly of little consequence that many readers will find themselves getting impatient. To be fair, the gritty details are important to Clinton and he seems to have made an honest effort to explore the reasons behind his personal failures, which nearly ruined a brilliant political career."
4,Revealing but at times skims the surface,"I think President Clinton should have produced his bio in a series of volumes rather than crowding it all into this one book. I had a natural curiousity about how Bill would have discussed his affairs with the several women he had affairs with. He discusses and defends each one of them from a point of view that he was just about falsely accused. This leaves the reader, justifiably, with the point of whether or not his personal life should have been exposed as much as it was. Does the President have to admit wrong-doing in his bio? Maybe not.The photos included are a inclusive snapshot of some of the major occurences of his administration.The last 4 chapters are too quickly discussed. A paragraph to some very major events which could have been a book onto themselves.I recommend this book. It is extremely well written and flows smoothly."
1,Caution to Sight-Impaired Readers,"My impression of this Large Print edition has nothing to do with content -- it's a terrific book. Rather, Random House appears to have cut corners by producing a SINGLE volume that tips the scale at 6.5 pounds, and is nearly 1,800 pages. Even at that, the paper used is so thin it is easy to tear a page by just turning it. This book should have been produced in TWO VOLUMES, and a higher quality paper should have been used. I feel shortchanged. Yes, I did send the publisher a note of concern, but no response has arrived. Yes, I called Mr. Clinton's office in NYC to let them know the book is not only unwieldy, but poorly presented. Try lugging this tome around -- you could sprain a wrist. Shame on Random House!"
2,This guy will do anything for money,"Isn't it interesting how despite repeated complaints from Californians about then governor, Grey Davis, Clinton never made a move, showed any interest, didn't even respond. BUT...how quickly did Slick Willy run to California to assist Grey Davis as he was being recalled.Over the years, Clinton refused to talk about Ken Starr, but LOOK at how open he is now that he has a book out and can make some money on the deal. Where's your values Bill?Personally, this guy makes me sick. He would make a great used car salesman and I'm looking forward to seeing his late nite informercials air very soon.I hope you are proud of yourself S(L)ICK WILLY!"
1,disappointing,"It is surprising to note that the author of this book had written published items before. Firstly the book takes forever to get through, it just plods on and is not well written. It is completely and horribly disappointing a book. Most of the book is conjecture and no real proof the authors' assumptions are given. She jumps from one area to another and the writing is completely disjointed. I recommend saving your dosh for a book that is more historically accurate and a better read. I could not wait to finish this book, and not for any positive reason. On one page she even contradicted the dates regarding the same item. Her conjecture is ridiculous and makes no historical sense at all. She would have been better writing a fiction novel, for that is what this truly is."
1,Biased Writer,"Alison Weir is the most biased writer of history I've ever read. She constantly slants things to conform to her own ideas of what ""really"" happened in history. I find it ironic that she goes out of her way to prove Isabella's innocence after the hatchett job she did on Richard III. I don't enjoy her writing style either. She rambles on from one thing to another and quite frankly, she's boring. I could not even finish her ""Mary Queen of Scots and Lord Darnley"" as fascinating a story as that is. I won't be reading any more of her books."
5,Jazz Heaven,"This is a great album! Between Benny Golson's tunes and Milt Jackson's playing this thing really achieves liftoff - it'll carry you right to jazz heaven if you listen. Afternoon in Paris, Whisper Not, and I Remember Clifford are especially soulful - I think this is a candidate for being the definitive version of Golson's tribute to Clifford Brown. Milt Jackson's solo is straight from the heart and totally captures the feel of this piece. Brilliant and moving. With Bennie Golson, Paul Chambers, Connie Kay, Art Farmer, and Tommy Flannagan - what a lineup! A classic late 50's Blue Note album."
4,"Great product, especially at this price!","I bought the Visor to get organized. I'm a big fan. It works great. Positive attributes: * High contrast for easy viewing. * Lots of great software available on the web for download. * Date Book Plus has many ways of viewing your schedule. * Expandable! * Dependable customer serviceSome things that you should be aware of: * Separate cover takes a little bit to get used to, but it snaps onto the bottom and is fully out of the way. * Top corners of screen may seem a bit loose when you press on them with the stylus. * Active area for the calculator icon extends above icon area and can be hit inadvertently when trying to press scroll down icon used in the lower right corner of some software screens. * Certain games can be addictive and consume more time than should be spent playing/solving them."
1,Be careful with your handspring!,A word of advice for handspring buyers - BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR TOUCHSCREEN! I had one break while it was in my pocket - literally. Only to find out later that the touchscreen is the only thing not covered by their 1 year warranty. It therefore will cost me a hefty $85 to replace it.Just an FYI. I'm not bitter or anything.
1,nice,"broke 30 days after the warranty, and they don't stand behind their product surprise. how many of us in the real world can make something that last for 13 months and have a job. if it was a fluke it would have been fixed."
1,Doesn't Compare to Palm V,"I was very excited about buying the Handspring Visor. However, twenty minutes after I bought it I started having technical difficulties. The screen would lock-up, and flash back and fourth on its own. I have decided to return it and go with the Palm V. Not only did the Handspring Visor dissapoint me, but the tech support line is long distance, and you wait at least five minutes before anyone answers. Also, you have to buy an additional serial port to send information back and fourth from your computer to your Handspring Visor. That costs an additional $30 shipping not included. When you add everything up it is just not a wise investment. I would strongly agree on purchasing the Palm V. A more reputable product is always the best choice."
3,Windows 95 Users read this!,"I ordered this product and it's great - however, if you have Windows 95 you HAVE to buy the serial cradle separately to use the sync capabilities. I didn't want to invest another $30 on top of the cost of the PDA since this is really a ""toy"" for me. The product seems great, and easy to use, but beware on the sync for Win 95."
2,Did not work for me,"I needed composter mostly for kitchen scraps and grass. When the composter arrived, I filled in up with green stuff, turned regularly, but it did not compose at all and it only smelled. I called the company after couple of months of waiting for my compost and they told me you need to add 2/3 of carbon rich stuff in (hay, dry leafs etc) together with the green stuff so it can compose. I do not have hay or dry leafs during most of the year! Obviously, this composter will not work for me. Returning it was easy. I am going to try something that can compost kitchen scaps only."
3,Nice compact unit.,Size and general quality of unit are just right for small-time composting. One flaw: Barrel sleeves threading does not match bolts supplied with it. Had to drill out to use nuts and bolts from local hardware store. You'd think company would test this stuff out. rpc
2,Think twice and then go to your local ACE to purchase a composter.,"Took us three days to figure out how to put the whole thing together. Needed to bring out the entire tool chest to do so and make one trip to the hardware store for parts.Item looks like the picture, however, it is heavy plastic and feels ""cheap."" We have no confidence that it will hold up for long even though we are only a three person household contributing to the compost. The door is precariously attached with plastic ""nubs"" which are just crying to break off after a few uses or removals.I would not buy this again."
2,Not very thorough,"This book is anything but a comprehensive guide. The author fails to go into verbose detail on almost every problem, leaving you guessing how she came to that conclusion. That would be fine if this was an advanced trig book, but it's the DUMMIES guide and as such I'd expect to be taken through every step of every problem. There's plenty of room for this; there are huge margins which could have been used to fill in more detail.It also completely fails to explain trig identities in a sensible way, which if you're a student struggling with challenging trig identity problems, this book won't be of any help."
2,Are you kidding??,"18 pages in, and I find an egregious error:Page 18:Example: Find the area of a circle if the angle between the two radii forming the sector is 80 degrees and the diameter of the circle is 4.5 inches.1. Find the area of the circle.The area of the whole circle is A=''(pi)r = ''(pi) (4.5) =' 3.14 20.25 = 63.585, or about 63 square inches.Now, either this is poor math (by not converting the diameter into radius), or poor editing (by meaning radius as opposed to diameter). Whichever it is, it doesn't instill a lot of confidence in the book."
1,Battery size is wrong,"The size of the battery at a glance looks OK but it has to be forced into the Nikon battery charger and to remove the battery from the charger is even more difficult. It has to be pried out!!To make things worse, initially there was an adhesive lable wrapped around the end of the battery that made it impossible to insert the batter into the charger. Worse yet the lable was difficult to remove. It came off in very small pieces and there was a very sticky residue left on the batter that was also very difficult to remove.I will never buy another battery from Battery-Biz!! A VERY BAD PURCHASE!"
3,Advertizing not correct,"The movies are great! but they are advertized as a 4 musical Pack, but in reality it has only three movies, this is the only negative thing I found out, other wise they are worth it."
5,IF YOU HATE EITHER/OR QUESTIONS,"Many of the clients I work with are Renaissance Souls (people with too many interests to pick just one.) They hate having to choose because picking one thing means giving up a whole bunch of others. For this reason, they hate taking the standard Myers'Briggs test where the choice is either this or that. Tieger's book avoids that problem by skipping the either/or questions and letting readers place themselves somewhere on a continuum in each area. This makes so much more sense and makes such a difference!"
5,Do What You Are,"I have used a version of this book before, but this one is expanded and I am loving it."
4,Advisable information,"Well this book is good but not good enough. Because it truly puts you in a category and provides you suitable careers according to your personality type, i.e., what careers you'd possibly find enjoyable based on the functioning of your brain.But each type offers varied fields of career. For example, as in my INFP type, you could be an actor as well as a psychological counselor. That means you have to pounder into what your abilities and interests are before you can find the right career.Thus I worked with ""Discover What You Are Best At"" by Linda Gale, which shows your aptitudes(abilities) to narrow the focus. And now I've found the right direction thanks to both books."
2,Perhaps I had overly high expectations...,"While I am aware that no career book is going to be a holy grail, this one in particular seemed rather useless. ""You are an INFP. You feel fulfilled by helping people, so go find a job where you can do that"" was pretty much the extent of the advice it offered."
1,Its Junk.,Sorry to say but this is just junk. When we opened the package we couldn't tell what was what! Very skimpy and poor quality. At least Amazon accepted the return. Looks great on the model but she would probably look good in a burlap sack!
4,Yes God is more than Enough,I loved this book by Tony Evans he did a wonderful job with this book! I found this book to be very well written and easy to read as well as understand! I really felt the lord truly made it possible for me to review this book. The book hit key points over and over about a lot of items going on in my own life! This is a great and easy read enjoy!!!!
5,Fun for outdoor play and letting your imagination wild.,"I bought these for my nine and eleven year old kids to play with. They love them. The bow is easy to use, and the arrows fly high far and well for foam. We highly recommend these to anyone who wants to play Robin Hood, or just take aim. The shoulder harness keeps arrows handy, and after several months, we have yet to have any injuries or broken toys. We just purchased another for a friend. Great fun!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"Our 9 and 7 year old boy's received these bow and arrow sets for Xmas and quickly learned they aren't at all what they expected. The item description states the arrows shoot over 100 feet and it doesn't even come close to that. First of all, it's hard to set the arrow up and align the bow w/ the string. It almost seems to flimsy for the arrow to stay straight and hold position. If and when they were able to get it set, once they shot the arrow it basically fell in front of them. Big dissapointment and waste of money. Neither of them have played with them once since Xmas morning."
5,Wonderful,"My 9 year old opened and was ready to play right out of box. No hassles or directions or putting together. He loves carrying around ""arrow"" in it's stringed holder. Dart ""arrows"" seem sturdy and don't have to worry about him breaking or hurting but still has powerful shot. Got in his Easter basket."
2,You get what you pay for.,"I took a chance on this set, buying it used, at a really low price, through an Amazon Marketplace reseller. A few of the movies are old classics, and were OK. Most are suffering from poor image quality and sloppy, unprofessional transfer to DVD. There are sound problems, ranging from very weak to loud and crackly (from over driving the audio input while recording to DVD). Many of the movies are outright ridiculous, being too lousy to classify as a B or a C film to begin with, let alone with the image and sound quality problems. I watched the set once, then gave it away. If I hadn't found someone to take it, I'd have tossed it into the trash. Believe me, you DO get what you pay for with this set."
2,ok,I don't care much for Spagetti westerns and this was ok. not great. It was tolerable to watch but I would'nt order it again
5,CLEP Analyzing and Interpreting Literature,"Excellent! I passed all the practice tests with a scaled score of 60 (50 is required) and was extremely pleased to pass the actual exam with a 65. Well worth purchasing. In contrast to some other reviews, the CLEP I took had several questions on the terminology, so I found the terminology review extremely beneficial."
4,CLEP Analyzing & Interpreting Literature with CD-ROM (REA): The Best Test Prep for the CLEP Analyzing and Interpreting Literatur,"I have been out of school for a long time, the extra help and test this book provided readied me for my exam and I passed with a B. I only studied for a few weeks with limited time daily. I would definitely recommend this book."
3,CLEP Literature Study Guide - Used it for teacher test in English,"I used the CLEP Literature Study guide as my main tool to study for the Colorado teaching test in English (the PLACE). I passed the test, so I guess it worked pretty well. It would have been nice to have more practice exams included on the CD, though."
2,The CD does not work,"I should start with the disclaimer that I have not actually taken the CLEP test yet, however, I am frustrated with this purchase. I read the review in the book and then took Practice Test 1 on the CD. When I reviewed the answers I got correct and incorrect, they were not accurate. I know the score the CD told me (though passing) is not accurate as the answers it says I chose I know are inaccurate. In addition, the CD does not match the book, so it makes it difficult to analyze your answers. In theory this is a great idea, however, the CD does not work correctly. I would not purchase this for the CD. The review was an easy read and probably gave some good information in terms of vocabulary. The written practice test was also helpful, especially with the explainations. But the CD DID NOT work accurately."
3,About the cd,Well...the cd arrived earlier than expected. I thought it would be in better conditions.Anyway it was very cheap so still worth it.
2,Packaged Together?- A Rip Off,"This is a great show to be certain but all this item is is both boxes shrink wrapped together in one order for $48. If you take the extra minute to do both separately, then season one is $13 and season 2 is $26. That's only $39."
4,Loves Comes to th Executioner,"I received my disk sooner than expected, which was a nice surprise. There was no damage to the disk or it's cover, as expected.I love the movie. It is an Indy film with a little of everything in it. The cast did a bang up job in their delivery of their performances."
1,Good Coffee Expensive Repairs,Do not buy this machine for long-term use as it is mechanically unreliable. Owned it for 3.5 years and had to have it repaired at 2.75 years for $190. Broke down a second time at 3.5 years and estimated cost for repairs again $190. It is going in the garbage and I will never buy an fully automatic Gaggia machine again.
5,Turn back the years naturally!,"I highly recommend all of Norman Walker's books. Although written many years ago, I think they are even more relevant in today's world. It is an easy to read book with information that will have you wanting more even information about the subject. Also, please read all his other books."
4,Good Book If...,"Juicing has long been a viable practice to restore health. But this book takes the concept of juicing to another level by explaining which juices help what ailments and so forth. I'm a big fan of Norman Walker, but what I've found is that there can be blood sugar issues with juicing - when you remove the fiber, and if you're sensitive to sugar (diabetes, hyperactivity, candida), you can have some serious problems with this approach. Great information but it should have come with a note explaining this approach is not perfect for anyone. That seems to be the raw food movement's big hand up - they refuse to realize that we are all different and need different or ""custom"" approaches."
5,"Great reference guide, again and again","We received this book from the Reverend who married us and have referred to it several times since our wedding day. It is practical, kind and a great resource when you can't seem to pinpoint ""what's wrong."" It is more about understanding your spouse and nurturing a healthy relationship, than trying to find a ""solution"" to everything. It is well-organized so you can skip around the topics, but it is also quite beautifully written. Makes a *great* wedding gift, too. :-)"
1,Once Upon a Time There Was a Good Company...,"Once upon a time there was a good company called Handspring. I think they hired a bean counter or they got greedy or both. Customer service from this company is better described as customer disservice. The product itself is okay but not spectacular. It will get the job done but you will, if you're anything like me, find lmitations that really could have been ironed out with a little more r&d. I bought the device based on the customer service. That customer service is no longer available. I HIGHLY recommend one of their competitors."
5,Handspring Visor Better Than the Palm,"I have been using one for over a month now and I love it, having previously used a Palm Professional. It is better than a Palm for less money.The advanced DateBook gives me the important list view of all my appointments. The advanced calculator is useful too.I recommend the JOT handwriting program to allow use of the full screen for writing, the backup module to get a full copy of all contents; synch does not back up everything. I recommend books from peanutpress.com; I love being able to carry a book with me on my Visor. I did not find the memory expansion module to be very useful.I use the leather belt clip carrier made for the Palm Pro. That way I always have my Visor with me. Most people just think I'm wearing a cell phone.Knowing that future capabilities will be made available on new springboard modules is a plus.Overall, a great buy and highly recommended."
3,Metabolic Thyrolean,"I already knew the product and it was only a new purchase. My doctor recommends, but I don`t see the effects. Another point is that although the delivery took place on the date scheduled, the time of delivery is too long. If you travel in the USA, as was my case, there is a risk of not receiving the product on time you need."
4,Underrated. Cool Giant Scorpion Monsters !,"Id call this an underrated movie. Im a little biased since I like monster movies. This really is very entertaining with large scorpions terrorizing the population. There are other creepy crawling monsters as well. The effects are by Willis O'Brien, and while not up to King Kong, this is still really good. They kept repeating a close up of the scorpion drooling which I didn't need. This is as good as Tarantula, not as good as Them and way better than the Monster from Green Hell. The DVD transfer from Warner is excellent too. If you like bug monsters, give this a shot.."
3,Gwangi in a scorpion suit,"Yep it is the standard big bug 50's sci-fi with a Mexican twist.We start with the obligatory narrative and a description of what may come. The narrator thinks that volcanoes are evil and bring destruction to farmland. To this land comes a pair of archaeologically strange doctors. They discover a fallen girl (that was just horsing around) and one of the scientists falls in love. The other states ""man is born single.""I will not reveal the ugly threat that you already see on the cover. However, I think they used them again in ""Attack of the Crab Monsters"". In addition, it is fun to look at the technology of the time; they use huge walkie-talkie's, flash cameras (out of flash range), and Bakelite phones. The annoying part of the movie is the kid that will not stay in the car; we all hope he is eaten early in the story.Attack of the Crab Monsters"
3,Typical silly 50's scifi with uneven special effects,"I bought this dvd only to get the only remnants of the 50's movie ""Animal World"" which has dinosaurs, which I remember being thrilled with when I saw it as a kid in the mid 50's. The Black Scorpion wasnt too bad as these giant insect/reptile due to atomic bombs experimentation, etc...The scorpions were sometimes animated in the Ray Harryhausen style and other times by some lousy cartoonish method, probably when they ran out of money or schedule.The girl was hot though, as usual she becomes a love interest for the guy who figures out how to kill the damn things.Lessee, kill a monster, get the girl (kinda like knights slaying the dragon and getting the chick in distress).One hilarious scene is when the giant scorpion decided to derail and bust up a train. I did a video capture on it and found printed on the locomotive tender.......Lionel Lines...So you get the picture.Fun to look at but only once and for laughs."
2,Expensive derivative for Play-Doh,"I was expecting the same Knete (clay) Faber-Castell is selling in Europe which is wax based and does not dry. However, this version was apparently made for the American market and essentially resembles Play-Doh - just for a much higher price and without the container which protects it from drying out.There is one advantage over Play-Doh which is that this doh, I do not want to call it even clay, sticks better together. Actual Play-Doh does hardly stick together which makes it difficult for children to model with it. In my opinion, the air dry feature is not even a feature. If you want to preserve your kid's art, then you are better off with Fimo. If you are looking for a fun and messy time with doh, you just get one of those large and inexpensive original Play-Doh sets."
5,"Miss XENA? Then come, Camrado -- LIVE THE LEGEND!!!","Now that Xena's dead and Buffy's working for Chickie-Beef, what's a girl to do for some butt-kickin' fun? Read The Warslayer, that's what! Get past the dorkie cover -- this book is great! Glory MacCardle is a gymnast-turned-TV-action-star, swapping kicks and punches with evil in ""The Incredibly True Adventures of Vixen the Slayer"" -- a show that owes lots to both Xena and Buffy and makes no bones about it. Then one day Glory gets tapped for a bigger role than mere leather-clad-icon -- a role it takes Vixen the Slayer to fill! I won't spoil the story for you, but trust me, The Warslayer's the most fun I've had since Xena turned in her chakrum. There's also a series guide, so you can argue over the respective merits of the various Vixen episodes. IS ""Mommy for a Day"" really the worst Vixen episode ever filmed? Decide for yourself!"
4,bible study,"We started this bible study at church it is a video style I was haveing some problems following. He goes very fast and very college lecture type, but I would read through the book and it seemed to make easier to understand. So if you do this study by video it is a good resource book to help follow along. It comes in kindle version which I really like."
1,If you were raised by Ladybugs and can't speak or read,"this is the eBay book for you. I recommend reading the tutorials on the eBay site for 10 minutes rather than buy this over priced rag. This is NOT an informative book in any sense. It's the size of the free coloring books they hand out to kids, trust me a kid and a red crayon will get more use out of this book than you will."
4,easy to read advice,"Got this for a friend who was out of the country for a while, so I ended up reading it first :) Good, easy to read advice to boost your self estime and help your drive towards success."
2,Honestly Not Worth The Money....,"Don't get me wrong, the selected tracks are good tunes, but the way the album is pieced together is a disappointment. The problem is that too many songs are being forced into one collection, and in order to allot for every song, most are edits. I don't know about you, but when I spend the kind of money I did for this CD, I want to get my money's worth of song. My advice: buy a compilation from Cream or MOS."
4,A Great Introduction To Trance,"This album is great. Since I got into the trance scene a little late, I wanted an album that would review big songs from the mid-90s and up. This compilation did that. Both CDs flow beautifully. The most appealing aspect about this album is that its great just to sit and listen to. I love trance for its build-ups and vocals, and this CD has a plethora of songs which encompass that. I would most recommend this album to those who want a well-rounded intro to this form of music."
2,a dissapointment...,"I don't quite understand why so many people gave this CD such high marks. There are a couple of good tunes. However, most songs sound kind of the same. The new Alice Deejay's album got lower ratings, but it's definitely much better (and cheaper)."
1,Terrible.,"This book is terrible. Unless you want to read a noncredible, very boring bunch of blabber from some lady who thinks she knows more than she really does, you will hate this book. If she were having a conversation with me, I would leave. It might be of some use to you if you have lived in a box your entire life and don't know a single thing about what the words ""sex"" and ""woman"" even mean. It's common sense 101 that will have you rolling your eyes. It is also very focused on older women who have given birth. I highly regret ever picking this book up and would not recommend it to anyone. Don't waste your time or your money. The end."
3,Chart reading confusion,"Lots of great stitches with pictures. I wish there were directions on how to read the charts. Since I am new to machine knitting, I struggle with how to make sense of them."
4,Great for Ground Coffee - Poor Coffee with ESE pods,"Gaggia 31001 Tebe Espresso Machine, GrayI researched many brands to replace the machine we had in the office. I wanted a machine that worked equally well with ground coffee and ese pods.Both Amazon and Gaggia said the Tebe worked with ese pods. It does not. The filter basket that comes with the machine permits too much water to go around the coffee pod, producing a weak espresso. I wrote to Amazon who deflected to Gaggia who did not respond to my problem. I googled the issue and found that I was not alone. I was able to purchase a shallower filter basket that make a good espresso with the ese pod. It took two weeks and nearly $20 more to resolve the issue. Customer service seems to be taking a back seat to profits at Amazon and Gaggia."
2,uncomfortable,"They are soo cute but they squeeze my toes so much I can't wear them. Also, I am normally a 7.5 - purached an 8 and they still were ill-fitting."
4,Cover to cover!,"This book was not easy for me to find, when I found it here I was very happy. Being interested in Christian history, this goes places many books leave out. The full color maps in back are very nice as well as the end notes after every chapter. My only complaint is in the quality of my copy. The binding tore out in back and for some reason (printer) much of the text in the index looks as though it has a drop shadow or something? This is not normal as I have seen other copies not like this. Unfortunate for me, but a great book worth the read/purchase none the less."
3,Eye found a decent band,"I'd have to say this album is pretty good. It certainly won't be my favorite goth-rock/metal cd, but it's not bad. The band just drips with the influence of The Cure, Type O Negative, and the Misfits. They give a blatant throwback to Christian Death with the cornily titled song ""Christina Death"". Oh Well; still not a bad album."
4,OK except for some missing text,"I like this book as it has a very good study in the book of Romans.the problem I have noted, especially in Chapter 7 which has 8 separate studies. When the number shows for for each of the 8studies, the subject text is all pushed to the right side and not complete,When going to the next page it starts with the Study andthe balance of the subject text never shows up. Not a real big deal, but it should be corrected."
3,its alright,"This CD is alright. There really isn't anything special about it. yeah its got kids songs, some you know and some you don't know.the songs are really short."
4,Cute CD of Classic Kids Songs,This is a great collection of songs for toddlers and my son enjoys most of the songs on the CD. The only downside of the CD is that after a while it can become a little boring to him and me compared to his other CDs like the Wiggles. But if you are looking for some classics mixed in with some christian favorites for a cheap price then this is a perfect cd to add to your collection.
4,very nice,"It is cute, up beat and Faith, (my daughter), really likes this CD. It is also very easy for me to listen to. My only thought is that it would be nice to be just a little bit more varied in the beats or the tone or instruments or something, from one song to the next. My daughter always enjoys when I put this on for her...but after a while she is a bit disinterested and has me switch to another CD.All in all I think it is a good CD to own and I enjoy the Christian quality."
4,NO MORE INKJET CARTRIDGES OR STREAKING ...,"Pros: Love this printer. Great color. No jams on different weight media. No more inkjet cartridges!Cons: If there is a way to delay the time before the printer goes into 'wait mode' which requires 'warming up' and slows print of first page, I can't find it. The printer driver is very basic lacking enough control over the printer from the PC."
4,Only one main complaint...,"I think this is a great safety gate, especially for the price.We bought this for the nursery, so we can leave the door open but keep the dogs out of the room. The gate installs really easily -- it took my husband a few minutes max -- and it looks better than some safety gates. The auto-close feature is a good idea for a safety gate, but it would be nice if you could disable it somehow. It does get annoying if I am just running in and out of the nursery and don't want it to close behind me.My biggest complaint, however, is the thumb latch that opens the gate. It's not the easiest to use. You have to slide it back and pull upwards at the same time, which is not impossible, but sometimes it feels 'stuck' and you have to do the motion again. It is not a huge deal, but it does get annoying.Even with those complaints, I still would recommend this gate -- especially if you are going to use it for a room or doorway that you don't go in and out of very often."
3,I CAN go for that...,"Continuing their comeback from a late 70's slump/rut, the duo follows up the success of Voices with this smash LP, their highest charting album to date (#5 on the Hot 100). Private Eyes yields two #1's (the title track and ""I Can't Go For That (No Can Do)""), plus the top ten ""Did It In A Minute"". While the title song sounds simliar to ""Kiss On My List"" from the previous album, ""I Can't Go for That"" has a unique R&B flavor to it and would become a hallmark track for H2O (get it...""Hall""-mark!). The album (what we used to call it) does have several weak tracks, as most do, but with the full-length version of ""Can't Go For That"", two other bonifide hits, plus the catchy ""Your Imagination"", it's basically a solid album overall. Also, as recording technolgy improved year by year, we hear a cleaner, sharper sound in this collection...something which would only keep expanding with each album (louder snare drum). Incidentally, I possess TWO copies of this LP on vinyl. - Fred"
5,Perfect!,"I ordered this for my young children to have some Christian Christmas music to listen to in the car. They are picky - but love this. I love it too, and am sure I will listen to it still, after the kids are grown. The singers are children, but not cutesy tiny kid voices. Just nice children's voices."
5,booya!,"yes, Yes, YES... that's all i was thinking when i first heard this album. all the songs are well thought out and executed beautifully. much more aggressive than recent albums (reminiscent of frigid forms sell, and even future isms) but with epic song structures (ala anaesthetic). probably the biggest surprise was return of ben davis to the fold. yes it's true, newton is not in the mix... but, with the resurfacing of davis it leaves me thinking ""roby who?"" old fans should not be disappointed, and new comers will hop on the milemarker wagon."
4,A good addition to Charlie and Lola collectors,"Cute story about Charlie and his little sister, Lola. Probably more amusing to those already familiar with this series and/or new TV series. This story about a playdate with a shy boy will appeal to parents who want to provide an offbeat story about getting along with those who are slow to warm up."
3,A good solid primer of state logic,"I found this book to be extremely helpful understanding the nuances of ladder logic. The book extends out past mere Allen Bradley standard ladder logic, and also covers Siemens and others, a good reference."
1,Not worth it,Even worse than his lectures. Thank god I stole this book instead of buying it. I don't think any real effort went into this. He doesn't care about accuracy.
5,Great Shoes,I own two pairs of Columbia Thongs myself. This pair was a present for my mother. She really loves them and would wear them all the time if she could. The price was great! Ordering was easy.
5,Very comfortable sandal,I love this sandal. It's so comfortable that I'm wearing them this winter as slippers in the house. Great item and fit.
4,Stanley SAE Metric Hex Key,"I wanted a system so I could just pick out a quick Hex easily in lieu of looking through my bag of Hex Keys. This a good product and I give it 4 stars. Once you use this, you will not go back to individual Hex Keys. And, Amazon's price is super. Hope this helps."
5,What A Wonderful Book,I enjoyed reading every page of this book as it gives good insight into Dr. Silkworth's contribution to the early days of A.A. Don't pass it up.
5,BrewStation,Certainally as good as the much more expensive versions. Does a very good job at a fraction of the cost.
4,Good Coffee-Great Coffee Pot,"We love the coffee. Hard to read to fill up the canister and it doesn't have a very wide opening for filling the canister, but the design is still good.Yes, I would buy it again and we have enjoyed it. My husband loves it."
2,"Good pot, til it breaks.","I loved this coffee maker, until it broke. One day it just started pouring coffee all over the place. I contacted Hamilton Beach and the only solution was to replace the entire tank for $19.99 (plus shipping) so for over half the purchase price I could ""fix"" this item. I will be purchasing a coffee maker from a different company. I am very disappointed to have spent a lot more on a ""quality"" coffee maker only to have it break."
2,LEAKS!,"This is our 2nd brewstation coffee maker and everyday we have coffee all over the counter from this leaking!(both of them leaked in thesame area) It must leak from the back or the bottom because I don't notice anything outfront of it leaking. Also, after a while it starts coming out slow. I think we will just get a normal coffee pot next time. It was a great idea just doesn't work that great."
3,Coffee just doesn't taste that good,I've had Hamilton Beach coffee stations before and been quite satisfied with them. But for some reason the coffee from this one just never tastes very good and I don't know why. I've tried several different types of coffee and that makes no difference. All types of coffee just taste weak regardless of how much coffee grounds I use.
2,Worked for two years.,"This worked great for two years. I used a water filtered pitcher to add the water to the hard-to-get-to water reservoir. My coffee was always hot, unlike some reviews.CONS:The buttons are too easy to bump into, and change the time.Without a pitcher, it is hard to get water into it.The coffee reservoir is hard to clean. I used a stiff brush.After a while, it started leaking into the insides by the heating element.Soon after that, the rubber gasket fell off and leaked coffee all over my counter and floor.I really enjoyed the carafe-less maker, but like so may others, this is a disposable product."
5,Works Great The best,This is the best coffemaker we have owned. Coffee tastes better..no pot to clean. I find filling the water reservoir to be no more difficult than other conventional coffee makers. No leaking issues either.Was a little hesitant to purchase due to some of the negative comments posted here but I have no complaints. No matter how good a product is someone will always be unhappy with it. Steve P
4,Works like a charm,We purchased this as a replacement for a regular coffeemaker with a glass carafe. The coffee stays very hot throughout the entire two hour holding period and it helps the coffee retain its flavor. The dispensing mechanism allows us to dispense into paper cups as well as into regular mugs or travel mugs. The footprint is slightly smaller than a traditional coffee machine and it looks very nice on the countertop. We recommend this product.
5,"Great item, great price!","I bought this Brew Station about 4 years ago. It is a great coffee pot. Makes a great cup of coffee, no broken carafe's to worry about. It is still running strong, no problems. Definitely recommend this product."
2,A bit of a one sided rant...,"I'm not an expert on the subject so I can't really comment on how acurate the information is, but my gut reaction is that it's very one sided. About half the book is taken up with information on Islam, and when the author IS discussing creation/evolution he implies that every evolutionist is out to trick the general public, and is knowingly involved in an intricate plot to dishonour God."
1,a ridiculous book to please the ignorant,"This book is ridiculous and completely nonsense. It is an impressive example of how the principles and evidences of a fully scientific theory can be distorted, to ""let the God enter from the back door"". The book is unobjective, unscientific and useless."
1,Pandering to the uneducated,"This book is horrible. Even as a work of fiction (which it most certainly is) it fails. I am a Christian and a PhD neurobiologist. Lying about the well evidenced theory of evolution only makes us believers look foolish and deceptive. How anybody with any sort of background (take our MD/PhD reviewer...please) in biology could find this ""book"" compelling is beyond me. Yahya demonstrates absolutely no knowledge of his subject matter. In fact, his glaring ignorance is perhaps the only thing that prevents me from calling this book an intentional act of deception. AHA! Now I get it. This IS an intentional act of deception. The title isn't actually referring to evolution as being a deceit, but rather the contents of Yahya's book are the deceit. How clever! Unfortunately, this irony will probably be lost on the majority of its readers."
3,Disappointed,"This book may cover lots of ground, but it seems that I can not find anything in the companion CD. The book lists code fragments and refer the complete code to the CD. There is no src for chapter 6 (DOM). Src list is incomplete for chapter 7 (DOM).I have not found a DOM API, I have not found an evaluation (or recommendation) of DOM parsers. The book may be OK, but the CD is horrible. The web-site is lot much better either."
5,Clear and rich examples,"This book is filled with really interesting examples that go way beyond your average XML book. The bad review I saw here mentions a bug in an example (something you are likely to find on any XML book), but what it doesn't mention is that there is a complete website of errata and additions to the code in the book (something you are not so likely to find), and the example was a really innovative and complex one: creating a JPEG image out of an XML file that describes colored areas. This book is more packed with interesting and useful examples for XML apps than any other I've seen. It has errors like many other books on new technologies, but they are publicly fixed and the information within is well worth looking."
2,"No Surprises, Unfortunately","The writer is decent, and not a bad book if you're completely out of other things to read. It's a formula. I knew the murderer right away, thus the rest of the book was just trying to get a hint as to why the person was staging these elaborate murders. The author takes (drags) you through chapter after chapter, only to give you a reason that is so tired and predictable that it made me what to toss the book in the trash when it finally reached the end."
5,"Tornadous , Keep You Up Nightmare , Page Turner","Someone is murdering people during tornados , And is doing it in a freaky way .Charlie Grover is the small town sheriff with a lot on his mind and alot to handle as he also has a unruly teenage daughter that....Theres the storm chasers , the scientists , and a small town sheriff whom was in a horrible fire as a child and was scared for life now he has to deal the the Tornado killer/ killers , and try to save his daughter , and he also has a struggling relationship with his father .This book has it all ... The weather (tornados) , and the storm chasers , A sheriff with the unruly daughter and the father that he dont care for ,light Romance And of course all the mystery one can handle . It will keep you up late turning the pages , Truly a great ending !Can't wait to read more by this author . 5 stars all the way !"
5,Brilliant psychological thriller,"Alice Blanchard is one of our most gifted contemporary writers, and her latest book, The Breathtaker, is psychologically complex, thought-provoking, and exquisitely written. The characters are sympathetic and intriguing; the plot is rich, with unexpected complications and revelations, and the book itself is impossible to put down. After you read this book, read Blanchard's first suspense thriller, Darkness Peering, another masterpiece. Then read her extraordinary collection of short stories, The Stuntman's Daughter. I'm waiting with bated breath for Blanchard's next book!"
2,Too many pages,When you read a book that could be written in half pages its original size it's a waste of time reading it. The main plot -if you can find it - is fairly good. At the book's end you'll find many loose ends in the family plot as well as the main plot. If you don't have anything else to read as some times happen read this one otherwise I don't recommend it.
2,"A high at the beginning, but mostly lows","I enthusiastically purchased the CD after hearing the first song, TO LET MYSELF GO on a music blog. That song is incredible, despite the limited lyrics. However the rest of the album made me drowsy, and never did much to hold my attention. I imagine she is captivating live, and her music is well built for small clubs, in basements, with entrances in the alley, but it doesn't hold an album together."
2,POOR DVD,THE SOUND TRACK SKIPS. THAT MAKES IT HARD TO FOLLOW ALTHOUGH THE STORY AND ACTING ARE VERY GOOD.IT ALSO IT TOOK ALMOST A MONTH TO ARRIVE WE HAVE WATCHED 4 FEATHERS ONCE.
3,A Good But Flawed Movie,"Four Feathers is a good movie and will appeal to anyone who likes the ""British Army take on the bad guys"" type of movie. Heath Ledger stars as ""Harry"" the soldier who becomes too scared to fight for his country, receiving 4 feathers as a sign of cowardice from his friends and fiance in return. Well done flick, but the scene where Ledger's character gets scared and leaves the army doesn't make any sense; ditto for his solo journey to rescue his doomed comerades. Why doesn't he want to fight? What happens inside him to allow himself to overcome his inner demons? The book probably provided the answer, but movie audiences don't know and that's the big flaw. Everything else is well done, though, making it worth watching."
1,Pathetic,"Four Feathers is one of the worst remakes of a classic film ever and I regret the time and money wasted viewing it. This version, by director Shekhar Kapur, not only lacks character, it virtually lacks a storyline for anyone not familiar with the history of the period,much of which is discreetly missed or misrepresented, anyway.The remake is even more pathetic given the availability of the technical advances in movie-making since the 1939 version, but possibly not advances in actors. As for the actors themselves, there wasn't much there and Kate Hudson was almost embarrassing to watch with her phony accent and complete inability to act.Contributing the movie's failure could also be Kapur's long-winded style of directing.I highly recommend the original, The Four Feathers (1939)."
2,Featherweight,"Watched this one, FOUR FEATHERS (2002), in anticipation of the re-release of the highly acclaimed 1939 version. This one is ponderous, slow, and undercooked. It contains one good battle scene, plunked in the middle, which is surrounded on both sides by an extremely plodding story of redemption. Even the exciting battle scene is undermined by the film's insistence on casting its slow-mo eye on the superfluous.1939's FOUR FEATHERS comes highly recommended and this one hasn't scared me off of it, but it certainly caused me to lower my expectations."
1,Video Quality,"This is not a review of the show but of this DVD release. Bandai Visual USA essentially put zero effort into this ""remastered"" three disc-set.There is a thick white line that always runs down the entire left side of the frame and there's a thin white line that sometimes runs down the right side of the frame. There's constant video noise that mars the image (not film grain, mind you, just video noise). Worst of all is the near constant frame judder. The video jumps constantly and almost never stops moving. It's extraordinarily distracting.To sum it up, this release has the quality of a bootleg at best - only it's priced ridiculously high instead. What a waste of money."
3,Blue Skin,"As good as others available at lower cost, but not in Blue. Evidently this supplier can take advantage of others not having this color. So buy elsewhere if you don't need bright blue; otherwise does the job"
5,"Invaluable Gadget, Great Price","I've had my Visor Deluxe for almost two years and I still use it every day. It's much more convenient than the paper organizer that I used to use, and after I started to use my Visor, I said that I would never go back. Even though newer Visor's have come out and more powerful Pocket PCs (such as the Compaq IPAQ) are available, I saw no reason to spend the extra money when my Visor served its purpose. The only thing that I think it lacks is rechargeable batteries, but those can easily be bought. The fact that the screen is not a color screen, doesn't matter to me because I have been using the black and white screen for so long. If you don't have a PDA, the Visor Deluxe is a great investment, and if you decide that it is not for you, the investment is not a large one."
5,nice gadget,"my only regret is i should have bought the ice model rather than the blue...sadly after only a few years of service, this gadget packed up. lost all my data. very annoying. decided not to replace it, too."
4,very good,"This is an excellent product that is both aesthetically pleasing but also functional. It has an excellent, crystal clear screen.Pros: Good screen, USB port, pretty (not as professional as the Palm V, or as compact for that matter), lots of spaceCons: Limited number of cases/accessories avaliable (yet), Certain programs will make this unit crash, bulkier than palm 5, ""Date Book +"" is absolutely useless because you can not back it up w/ palm desktop. World Time is nice, however, it is possible to get the same program for free."
1,Watch out with Handspring Visor Deluxe,"Cool colors, cool price (compared to Palm products), but WATCH OUT with the Handspring Visor deluxe... I bought two of them plus a phone modem... the Modem and one of the Visors was totally defective (they replaced them fast after months of tech support calls). But WORST OF ALL was the non functionalality of wireless modems with the Deluxe models (you have to buy the new Platinum or Prism models). The main reason I bought two of these was to use the PROMISED springboard wireless modules... but NO CIGAR on that one... now I'm ""dead ended"" with these ""DONKEYS"""
3,It's Huge,"I bought a Sony HDR-HC7 camcorder and bought this bag for it. This bag is HUGE. I planned on using it only for my tiny little camcorder and it's just way too big for it. I mean if you're going to stuff this thing with countless other things, you're going to run out of space with any bag. This thing measures about 1 1/2 foot long and 1 foot tall. Measure this out and you'll see how big it really is."
4,Sony camera bag,"This bag is built very well. The quality is top notch. There is sufficient padding to protect whatever one puts into this thing. It is, however, a bit on the small side. It can fit a small camcorder, power adapter and a few accessories no problem. But that is about it. The latch mechanism is a bit odd though. It may look cool, but it can be a pain to close and it does not really seem that secure. As a testament to its reliability I have had it fail on me once. That is why from now on I use the shoulder strap whenever I carry the bag around. But for what little I gotta carry around in this bag it is near perfect."
4,Vintage BBC,"The Moonstone is classic vintage BBC from a time when there seemed to be much more interest in portraying 19th century literature for eager viewers. As a great fan of Robin Ellis (Poldark) I have been wanting to see this production for quite some time. The production values, acting and story were all quite wonderful with one exception: the costuming of Mr. Ellis was quite horrible. Although probably historically accurate, the plaid suit, bow ties and round crowned hats were less that flattering, and gave him the look of a 10 year old school boy. As the major love interest and hero of the story, a more mature look was essential to his characterization. Call me superficial, but as his sweetheart I would have had to laugh at his clothing choices and wonder aloud at his level of romantic sophistication. Other than that, it was a great show to look forward to. If only there were more on the way...."
3,Not what I expected,"When I went to the movies on April 5th I expected sheer thrills and suspense with a good storyline. I got one and some of the others. The acting was very good, but could've been better. Jim Caveizal throws down a great performance as the husband of an attorney, cheesily acted by Ashley Judd. Morgan Freeman does very good as an old drunken attorney and Amanda Peete puts contributes with a fair wild sister. The storyline was great, but the filmed dragged on. Yet, it results in a surprising ending that chilled me through."
3,When Mediocre Movies Happen to Good Actors,"Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd are two of the best character actors in the business, and their chemistry together can be phenomenal, as the pedestrian ""Kiss the Girls"" demonstrates. ""High Crimes,"" however, is a movie that is simply not worthy of its stellar cast. The plot is pejorative, riddled with holes, and at times quite boring, and the denouement is incredibly trite and predictable. The story is semi-interesting, but is nothing you haven't seen in a Lifetime movie, and it makes you wonder why the two leads signed onto this project at all, other than the chance to work together again. The movie is supposed to be a mix of drama, suspense, and action, but in its attempt to incorporate all three, it falls short in every respect. Definitely a movie to rent, and not buy."
3,So so movie.,"It's not a bad movie, but not an outstanding one either. If you're a fan of Judd or Freeman like me, watch it. If not, skip it."
3,Too many sideplots create gaps...,"When a successful defense lawyer's husband is accused of murder by the United States Marine Corps she faces the toughest time in her life. The military court system is different from the civil court system, her husband is assigned a young military lawyer without experience, someone is trying to stop her with the use of violence, and she finds a recovering alcoholic to help her present the defense for her husband. Meanwhile, she is trying get pregnant while her sister has been evicted from her apartment and is dating her husband's young, naive, military lawyer. These plots among others ends up turning the film into a story that has too many holes and makes the whole film experience rather unbearable."
3,IF IT WASN'T......,"for Freeman and Judd, this film would have been a flop. The plot was alright but I had the feeling from the beginning as the story unfolded, that the poor husband was in fact the guilty party. So the ending was no surprise to me. The military courtroom scenes leave alot to be desired, were weak and tedious.I bought the DVD but sure would have been satisfied just to rent it."
1,Waste of Time,"HO HUM! We found the plot and characters to be completely unbelievable. Glad we didn't pay the ticket prices to see it when it first came out as I don't think I could have sat through it. At least being able to check it out from the library, we didn't waste money!"
3,A waste of time,"A defense lawyer's husband is arrested by the FBI for crimes he supposedly commited while in the military. He's been living under an assumed name. He assures her he didn't really do it, he's being framed. There's a huge coverup. And she defends him.This could have been a good movie, except there were so many pieces of it that didn't tie together. Most of the subplots did not weave neatly into the main story and the main story itself lacked punch. True, we have this wonderfully (or horribly) surprise ending, but that is the only twist the movie takes. And I did not feel that one twist redeemed the viewing experience.The acting is all right, but most of the characters are poorly drawn, and the plot muddled. High Crimes leaves you feeling empty and dissatisfied."
1,Actually Distracting,"Sounds of Nature: Ocean Waves sounded like a good CD from most of the reviews. When it started up, the pounding of the surf was wonderful. And then...the seagull started. The bird cries seem to be dubbed over the ocean due to their startling clarity. Plus the bird was obviously perched on top of the microphone because it was so loud. No dopler effects from distances, no multiple calls, just a single bird. And the bird keeps jumping from side to side (left speaker to right and then back). Perhaps other birds join in later but I didn't bother waiting to find out. The purpose of the CD was to drown out office noise and allow me to concentrate. Instead I found myself flinching everytime a bird call came. The earphones came off and the CD is gone. Don't bother with this one if you're looking for soothing ocean sounds."
4,Just what my daughter needs!,I love this book. I have a 6 year old with whom I experience the same thing as in the book. She's constantly ranting about wanting her hair to be straight like mommy's and she HATES getting her hair washed & braided. So I thought I would find African American books in regards to her hair texture to help her understand this is natural and something to help her be proud of her heritage. She loves the book!
1,Empty like northwest China,"This movie is like the expanses of northwest China where it occurs, nothing is here. The dialog is sporadic. There are times of no dialogue where next to nothing is occurring. There is an attempt at being mystical that produces just plain dullness. I have watched many Asian movies the past few years. Some like ""To Live,"" ""King of Masks,"" ""Eat, Drink, Man, Woman,"" and ""Heaven and Earth,"" I have watched many times because of the high quality of screenplay and acting. ""Life on a String"" gets my lowest rating of any Asian movie I have seen."
3,Koldborn ~The Uncanny Valley~,"Koldborn are a death metal band from Denmark that appear to pull as much from their hardcore influence as they do their death metal roots. The band has created a modern death metal album that strays from the tried and true Gothenburg movement in favor of an old school thrash and groove style with brutal riffing and guttural, unrelenting growls. The band is not overly technical but they have a tight song writing style that will keep anyone looking to stay away from metalcore and the pervasive Gothenburg sound happy."
5,"The video worth 1000,000,000","This video is great! I mean, not only is Bean one stud of a cartoon character, the comedy content is wicked! Some of the faces he pulls are just sooo wicked, and it's all down to the animators. There's a wide spread of characters in the film, and I watched it over 20 times the first day I got it! I know go round quoting the hilarious dialect and witty comments to myfreinds, who love it just as much as I! A good start to any manga/anime collection, or even if your looking for something interesting to watch, Riding Bean is the one for any occation."
2,"Victorian romance is perfect, the modern is.... just awful.","I really wanted to love this movie. A romance featuring a modern story, a victorian one starring Gwenyth Paltrow and featuring Jennifer Ehle sounded very good. But everything that happened in the modern romance was just awful. I really didn't care about either of the main characters. I didn't care if they got together, I didn't really care about them at all. Except when they found new information about the Victorian romance, which is a wonderful story.I really wish this had just been a movie about Ash and LaMotte and their relationship. The modern story is just bad. But the older one is very good, well-developed and interesting. Jennifer Ehle is stellar in this movie, while Gwenyth delivers a very, very poor performance."
4,Classic,This movieis classic Paltrow! The plot was wonderful...full of surprises andI would recommend to anyone that enjoys that period in time.
2,Toby Stephens Fans - save your money,"Toby Stephens barely appears in this film. He's supposed to be a villian but you see so little of him he hardly registers.The film itself is well-plotted, well-shot, well-acted but very poorly written. It's about poets (a take-off on the Brownings' story), but none of the characters says anything remotely poetical or memorable. You would have to care about the characters to swallow the fantastical story, and unfortunately the characters are such stereotypes that it just doesn't hold together. If you're hungry for romance read the Brownings' letters -- pure sugar cane as opposed to this way over-processed stuff."
4,"Believe it or not, Victorians DID have steamy sex","...which is more than I can say about the modern couple. If you expect to see Gwyneth Paltrow take her clothes off, don't bother with this movie. She plays a frigid arrogant scholar, which is not too much of a stretch for her. In my opinion, she is not romantic damsel-in-distress material. She's much more interesting when she plays cold and cynical characters. Jennifer Ehle, on the other hand, shows quite a bit of skin. The clandestine love scene between the two poets still stands before my eyes.I read the book, so I could tell that the movie left too many loose ends untied. For instance, it's not clear in the movie why Gwyneth Paltrow's character is crying."
5,Always great,"I bought this for my dad, he has always been a fan and the sound quality is great, he was happy to hear it again after having gotten rid of all his records a few years ago! Fast ship, great transaction all around."
5,New Folks a Comin',"One great book I've read is Rabbit Hill by Robert Lawson. It contains advernture, expression, and animals. There's a skunk (who eats garbage), a red buck, a fox, a mole, fieldmice, a cat, dogs, rabbits, and new Folks. The new Folks don't set out traps, poisons,etc., but grow extra fruits and vegetables for the animals! The new Folks even put up a sign that reads 'Please Drive Slowly on Account of Small Animals'.(Talk about nice!) There are food problems,tragedies, and other plots (such as the main character,Little Georgie, being hit by a car, will he survive?). I enjoyed this book because the plots weren't too serious and they weren't difficult to figure out. If you like stories with happy endings, or stories with animals, you will enjoy this book!"
5,pure chaotic sanity,The world is screaming to the top of itself in this outlandish God-search by His quartet and many more. The most intense musical experience there is.
3,Cool but could improve on quality,"I recently bought a blue Visor Deluxe for my wife (she liked the color and was tired of waiting for the Palm Vx to come in stock). As a long time Palm III user, I too was swayed by the expansion port and the lower price and even thought about switching myself. Now that I've seen it though, I'm holding out for the Palm Vx. It works great and my wife loves it but I find a noticeable quality difference between the Palm and Handspring products. The Visor's case is a bit rickety, it's awkward to put in its cradle, and the writing surface feels scratchy and has a weird ""give"" that bugs me. If you've never used a Palm (like my wife) the Visor is a good bet for expansion and economic reasons. But for those used to the sleek Palm feel you may be disappointed."
4,A Great Read,"This is an excellent book: A gritty account of life on the road with my favourite band. If you like the Ramones, you need this book."
5,Baby Lamby,"This is our 4th lamby from Bowron. LOVE them. And so have our babies, niece and nephew. Great price and shipped quickly. Couldn't be happier!"
4,Good,"Lloyd Banks - Hunger for More is definetely worth the money. Even though it only has 14 songs, bout 12 of them are bangers. Lloyd Banks is the best lyricist of all 5 members of G-Unit. Some beats aren't the best but are still good, plus the lyrics make up for it all."
3,Expecting More Later.....,Lloyd is by far the best lyriclly but i guess i was just execting more tracks. You really should get the album to support g unit it is worth it. Maybe next time but it did do good on the charts and thats a good sign!
2,Get off His Nuts,"I was expecting A LOT more from Banks. The songs on this album are mediocre except for a select few, including Warrior, Work Magic, and On Fire. Those are pretty hot.His punch lines and lyrical flows on this album are NOTHING compared to what he's showed on mixtapes and features. His lyrics just suck next to his usual.The beats would be good if they didn't have the same grimey NY sound repeated all through the album. I expected more variety since I've heard him spit on so many different types of beats on mixtapes.It's a short ass disc, too. He claimed to have 18 songs already done before he was to officially start his album... but there's only 14 on the regular copy and 15 on the collector's edition."
3,I'm not impressed,"Right now I'm tryin 2 find more to be excited about on this album. The good songs are his solo ones like ""Die One Day"", ""Til The End"", and ""South Side Story"". I like the original ""Warrior"" more than the part 2 with Em, 50, and Nate Dogg, which looks like a great song but is really nothing special. I wasn't about to give this album anything less than a three though. This album is pretty good, but it's way too short and his bragging songs get annoying in the end. If there weren't this many guest appearences, this album might possibly be a classic, but it sadly let me down.was this review helpful to you yes or no"
2,he doesn't want much,"this album is horrible. obviously banks belly is already full. but let's keep it real. this album will sell because of the g-unit affiliation. hip hop is in a bad state right now beacuse instead of being a good mc you just have to roll with the right people to move units. most people probably will say this review wasn't helpful just because people are on a g unit high right now but eventually that high will come down. examples:ja rule,vanilla ice,m.c. hammer,etc. all those guys sold millions of records(separatly) but now people diss them just because and i feel most people will buy this album just because. not necesarilly because it's good but because he rides with 50."
5,Help,"Can someone plz post the real tracklistings of the album. Some says there's 15 and some say it's 19. I got 15 songs from the internet, but i don't know if i'm missin any. thanx."
1,horrible,man i almost feel asleep listening to this crap!! this cat is all hype with no substance!! i only like two tracks on here!! im so sick of these gunit cats!! i definetly recommend you save your money and go buy something else!!
4,More To Come From Lloyd Banks.,"Being a huge Lloyd Banks fan i thought he could of done better on some of his beats in his songs and come up with better songs..but his lyrics are amazing, so thats why THE KID didnt get 5/5..Overall this Cd was a 4 stars fo sure..And for people who think hes garbage..hes only 21..and he is the best lyricist in rap TODAY...Only bad song on the cd was Karma, I have no clue what he was thinking with this song..Take it out and its a Bangin cd..Best songs were Playboy..Warrior..Im So Fly..Warrior Part 2..When the Chips Are Down..Southside Story.."
1,Another G-Unit Production,"Well, anotha G-Unit Produced CD...dont u think dat it should b simlar to otha lyk 50 or Beg 4 Mercy? newyz...althou banks claims himself to b on fire..it may b only for awhile bc u can get sick of dat song so easily n plus wit da help of a bro(50) den people will listen. A CD not worth buying, most of the songs need more work and lyrics are terrible in some that u mite have heard elsewhere. Banks mite b lookin goo, howeva not so long if he sticks wit this kinda BS that he cant make it no betta.To compare wit other CDs this year, u guttah stick wit Twista, Usher, Kanye West, Jay-Z"
5,Another classic from Aftermath!!!!!!,"i order this cd the day it came out. i had high hopes for lloyd banks cos i had listened to Beg For Mercy and Banks was great on it.all the tracks on The Hunger For More is great. The beats are truely gangsta except Karma, which is a love song (like 50 cent's 21 questions)All the guest appearances are great. ""when the chips are down"" features The Game. This is 1 of the best songs on the album.""if you so gangsta"" has a EXTREMELY catchy chorus and has tight lyics.""southside story"" is a story about when Banks was still in the hood, great lyrics.The worst track is ""i get high"" i know a lot of people will disagree with me but i can't stand the chorus.Overall this is a great album from a talented rapper. I can't wait for his 2nd album."
2,Pretty Gay,"Lloyd banks pooped himself on this mutha cuz it sucks, only decent track might b warrior pt. 2 yeah lloyd, go clean yaself up, youre finished boiii"
1,egomaniac,"if you heard hot 97 when 50 said lloyd banks is lyrical, banks was telling himself ""I'm a Beast"" ""I'm a Beast"". Please, have any of you brainless teenagers heard KRS-One Spit?? have you heard Nas Spit?? and you call Lloyd Banks a beast??? who wants to look up to a gay guy who talks about himself and him getting money and doing hoes and being better than you. whatever happen to speaking for the people?? and whats 50 Cent's comeback after someone disses him about that? ""O i sold more records"" ""O i have more money than you"" HE SOUNDS LIKE NELLY!!!! remember nelly's verse on nellyville ""I'm tired of hearing whats real hip hop, but there album flops!"" you see i rank 50 Cent right next to Nelly. i used to have love for 50 cent when he was hard and didnt make love songs, but now.....Candy SHOP!!!!???? Disco Inferno?????????? GARBAGE!!!!"
4,The Hunger for More,"The highly anticipated solo album from G-Unit's own Lloyd Banks is solid. When reviewing anything, the best way to go is to give the good & the bad, so here we go.The album starts off with Aint No Click with Tony Yayo. I'd heard this prior to buying the album and i think it's pretty good. G Unit is known for their street anthems so this one definitely was more of what i was expecting. Playboy is a good cut, more of Banks giving his fans what they know him for, the playboy of g unit with the slick punchlines. Warrior is another banger, already popular for it's catchy lyrics. On Fire was a hit single for a reason. I Get High was one of my least favorites, but it's decent. The best songs on here are Warrior Pt 2, Southside Story, When The Chips Are Down, Work Magic & Til The End. The rest are decent songs, with I Get High & If U So Gangsta being the weakest but still OK.Overall the album is from a 3.5/5 to 4/5. Solid debut album from Lloyd Banks."
4,"Good CD, considering....","Typically, I'm a fan of more meaningful hip-hop by artists like Mos, Talib, Common, Blackstar, and Kanye, but I'm definitely liking Lloyd Banks a whole lot. I bought the CD because I was really feeling ""Smile,"" but it's not on this CD anyway. In fact, a lot of the songs that are listed on the Amazon Track Listing aren't on here, as has been mentioned before. I'll be honest and say that the only songs that I have really listened to in-depth on ""The Hunger for More"" are ""Warrior,"" ""On Fire,"" and ""Karma"" of which I prefer ""Karma"" the most since it's a lot more reminiscent of ""Smile"" than any of Lloyd's other songs. But, I've heard everything on here at least once, and they're all good. I also really like ""I Get High"" (with Snoop & 50), ""I'm so Fly,"" ""If You so Gangsta,"" and even ""Warrior, Part 2"" even though I'm not too into Eminem. ALL of the beats are on point on ""The Hunger..."" and Lloyd's flow is as well.4 of 5. Good CD."
2,Hunger For More,"i just bought the hunger for more lp and to me its garbage, lloyd is coming harder on his guest app. and mixtapes then he is on hunger for more.as for the tracks there okay but mostly soft and wack hooks and the beats are below average, lloyd comes a little soft on this album, but yayo tops it off with one of the worst verses in history, i guess being in jail didnt give him enough time to write a verse that held any weight.the rest of the cd is okay warriors 2 is kinda hot eminem comes off boring again , its like hes not moved by hip hop anymore likes it not fun for him, im not feeling eminem right now,to make a long story short lloyd banks hunger for more gets a total rating of 3/5..."
2,NO WAY,Definelty was expecting better....this was a total dissapointment. I thought LLoyd was gunna bring it better but i guess not. He has alot more hype and i thought he would give us a better cd but i find my self skipping many songs on this CD u gotta love lloyd but its only worth a burn...maybe not even...oh well total dissapointment
3,No Diss,I love G-Unit but some of the songs on this album has to be filler. I love the song I'm so fly and Warrior pt2 and Karma.
1,Puhleeze!!!!,"This LP is garbage. Snoop's rhymes in ""I Get High"" are the only solid lines in the entire cd. So if ur considerin' buyin' this cd, i would advise u 2 d/l it instead (if u wanna waste tha time) since there are only 2/3 replayable tracks at most. But if u want a HOTT summer LP go on and pik up Lil Wayne's ""Tha Carter"" because unlike ""Hunger 4 More"" it won't disappoint."
5,The Huger for more!,LLoyd bank$ is one of the best new rappers right now. He's so good I have become speechless. Bu thtere is one thing I have to tell you the best three songs on the albem are On Fire Karma and Warrior.
3,good album by Banks!,"Lloyd Banks is one for the future, his lrics are great and his rapping skills are good too, but it's too early to say his a great rapper because this album is not that great. I like 'warrior part 2' 'i'm so fly' 'when the chips are down' and his lyrics are great great in 'till the end'. I'm not really a big fan of 50, or in this case g-unit, but Banks is a good rapper and he'll be great in the future. Tony Yayo is good too and his new album is coming in may, so watch out for that one."
1,Disappointed,I was so disappointed when I heard this album. I think Banks could have done so much better. I would rather listen to his old mixtapes than this garbage. This is not a CD I'm going to be playing much this summer!
2,"All the hype, and mediocre at best","After all the hype about Lloyd Banks, the ""Hunger for More"" is mediocre at best. For the last 6 months all I have heard is how great Lloyd Banks is, but his first cd hardley delivers on the hype. The first single ""fire"" is basically your generic club record for the ladies, as is the awful ""karma"". I find it quite humerous that G-Unit used to make fun of Ja Rule for doing RnB flavored records for the ladies, and it seems that the last bunch of G-Unit singles have all been on the ""thugs-in-love""/Ja Rule level. Although there are a handful of tracks that deliver on the hype (ie Warrior), Lloyd Banks has trouble holding down a whole album with his monotone sounding flow, which gets tiresome after awhile. I am sure this album will sell based on popularity of G-Unit, however, this is hardly the Classic that was talked about. Furthermore, it hardly lives up to the massive hype that Lloyd banks has recieved."
1,TERRIBLE,"If you want to go deaf listining to garbage this is the album to listen to. The only thing woth hearing is ""On Fire"" and the best track on the cd ""Let Me In"". Dont by this cd, by straight outta cashville by Young Buck!!"
5,An amazing account,Awesome to step into the aura of an amazing and colourful woman so full of life. A descriptive and frighteningly personal biography
3,"Mibro 8"" Dado Set","This set works quite nicely. I had occasion to use it on very hard wood on a large cabinet for my wife. The dadoed walls of the wood required very little touch-up. Having always used a wobbler dado I found this one a little difficult to get properly sized using shims and making sure the kerfs were not touching. The carrying case fell apart after just a few times of opening and closing it. But, that is a small matter since I didn't purchase the unit because of the box. However, not being engaged in production woodworking, it may take me years to really see how it does with all the different materials I use for custom projects. Given the reasonable price for this item I feel I got what I paid for."
5,HAPPY CAMPER DUDE,wow what a great deal i looked and could not find anything in my price allowance then this so i bought it and boy i am so happy i did excellant product see ya steve
2,Worthless,I have to say I regret this purchase even though it is so cheap. Cross grain dados are HORRIBLE. Tons of blow out. Straight grain dados are better but there are so many ridges on the bottom that it is a real time-waster to clean them up.I don't want to spend $200+ on a set but in the big picture they may save you a ton of time.
1,Another Stakeout,The disc of this movie that I received could not be played on my DVD player. Aparently it was some type of european (or other foreign) production which could not be played on an American system. It was returned.
1,blue ray,I ordered the blu ray in error. it did not work.It cost me 1/2 the price of it to restock the movie. I won't make that mistake again.
2,No fan of THIS Bali bra,"I am a loyal Bali Bra customer. I thought I'd give this style a try. The front ""loops"" cause the bra to stretch lower than it should (after only a few days of wear). Also the nylon lining was itchy. I don't recommend this particular style to anyone."
3,not much variety,"The instructions are clear enough, however I was hoping for more size varieties, 4"" - 20"". I am still looking for a tiny knitted bear pattern.I also deducted points for the author's insistance on one yarn, which not everyone has ability to obtain. I think an improvemnet would be using generic terms for yarns, baby weight, sport weight, 4 ply, that sort of thing.I hope that these tiny complaints will not stop others from trying this author's patterns. The one I am doing now is going together well and it is very very easy to do."
1,Way Too Fragile; Disappointing,"I purchased the visor deluxe and found it to be a handy tool until one day it dropped lightly on a carpeted floor within its case. This happened about one week after the purchase. The LCD screen shattered rendering it useless. I contacted the company and they warrant all parts EXCEPT the LCD screen for one year. I own many electronic products, which do not break when dropped lightly on the ground. It is for this reason that I cannot recommend the Visor. They need to make a more durable product at the prices they are charging."
