5,Truly extraordinary post-Swans masterpiece!,"Not at all what I expected, this release took me completely off-guard. Extremely personal and stunning..... Just buy it!"
2,"bad baby, bad!","Okay, it's not high art but this film has something to say all be it in a round about fashion. It does make the viewer wonder about modern medicine and how it can possibly affect those who take it on a regular basis. On the other hand, the film lacks true suspense. I was hoping for an explosive opening scene when the baby is first born and instead was offered a yawn. The baby itself is about as scary as fozzy bear and while there is some blood flow it is kept to a minimum. The pacing is too slow at times and it just doesn't stand up that well today. The actors who took part in this didn't go anywhere say for the father who went on to appear in the sequel. Why there was a sequel is beyond me. I recall how frightening the commercial was for this film when it first came out but I was only five at the time. At the most this is a rent not a buy. I guess good for it's time but perhaps a re-make would pump some needed life into the story."
2,Awful but cult,"I had to watch it because I had seen the original in the theatres in the '70's. Better fx than the original and just as bad. A must-see but remember it is awful. It's just such propaganda it's almost cult, like Reefer Madness was for pot, this is for medicines. Hippie greenpeace liberal puke."
2,DOESN'T QUITE LIVE UP TO THE LEGEND,"As a kid I'd always read and heard about how scary and horrific IT'S ALIVE was supposed to be. One lonely night I managed to catch IT LIVES AGAIN: IT'S ALIVE 2 on late night tv and found it to be rather frightening. So when I finally got my hands on a copy of Part 1 I was ripe with antici...pation. Unfortunately, I found much of the film to be either long-winded or funny. There was a tiny bit of suspense and two or three scares, but overall I was mostly bored. The killer babies are freaky, and it does offer a good dose of 1970's social issues and morality plays, but for the most part I just wasn't into it. (Though I must admit I was thrilled to see one of those Letter People ""Mr. M"" used in a kindergarten classroom sequence.... memories....)"
2,Dullsville,"I was really disappointed in this movie. I have heard so much about it, but it was just a let down. ""It's Alive"" is so unrealistic, I would have actually liked it better if the baby was normal and running around with a knife! It's funny to watch the mother just casually say ""it's time"" when she goes into labor. I have been around women when it starts and there is some screaming and stress involved. People wish leaving for the hospital was that pleasant. You barely get to see the monster and the movie itself is dull. I almost went to sleep watching. Needless to say, the box of the movie with the cradle as the picture is way scarier than the film"
5,great old 70s flick,"if your a fan of the 70s horror flicks with their subtle way of scareing you then youll love this flick,"
4,"With my luck, my kid is going to end up like this...","It's Alive is a Classic B movie from the 70's. What's it about? Two words: Killer Baby. Despite you ever getting a chance to see the baby, it's a rather interesting film that is done pretty well. Take this movie for what it is. It's a B movie with good acting, hilarious storyline, yet manages to take itself seriously. I was surprised by this film. I thought it would have been pure crap, but it was carried out rather well and seriously. I really enjoyed the movie as I am sure others do too. I wouldn't advise buying this movie though, just rent it instead or get it for a cheap price. It's not a film you will watch often, but you will find yourself telling your friends about it. Rent it, laugh a bit, and enjoy it. I sure did. My favorite scene was when the killer baby attacks the milkman, it's awesome."
3,EVIL NEEDS SOMEONE TO DO ITS JOB ...,"Sometimes evil needs someone to to his dirty job. In war, there's no quarter given or taken. Arthur Harris was C-in-C Bomber Command in WW II, and he led RAF bombers to destroy German cities, with never regretting. In doing so, thousands (almost 50%) of RAF's aircrew perished or were taken prisoner, with what gain? Even today the answer isnot clear. What is clear to me is that Harris never once lost his sleep for the thousands of people (British and German) that his orders sent to die, always under cover of ""Orders are orders"". He apparently felt joy doing his job."
2,Poor Quality recording and sound selection,"Not to impressed with t5he video quality and song selection here, seems to do a great talent an injustice"
3,Not quite as pictured,"I purchased this based on the picture. I do not have a big car, a Toyota Solara 2 dr coupe, and the shade does not come all the way across, or up and down like the picture shows. My visor barely reaches it to hold it in place. I wish it was larger, but I still like it."
3,"Limp shade, otherwise good","Very reflective (diamond plate) and nicely insulated, nice cutout for the rear view mirror and even folds well. The problem is that when I leave it at work in the sun for a few hours the shade gets limp and starts to fall down. Happens more the hotter it gets. Major flaw, but if that gets fixed it would be a 5 star sunshade by me."
4,Childhood memories,"My memory may be jaded, but I have nothing bad to say about this album. Put this CD on while you make your kids do the dishes. They won't remember how you tortured them, only the great and humorous tunes. Great for a family sing-a-long!"
5,Very Best of Les Paul & Mary Ford,Great collection of music. I had forgotten what wonderful music they produced. Brought back fond memories.
5,A Must Read For Everyone,This book is a must read for everyone who loves (or has ever loved) an animal. This book proves that you can do anything you set your mind to and hopefully will encourage people to volunteer to help animals (like these) in their own area.
5,Best concert film ever?,"Forget for a minute that the Sex Pistols play an amusing and fulfilling set in this one. This film is greater than that. The editing, photography and sound are an incredible achievement. It's a shame this isn't even listed in imdb's database because it holds its own as one of the crown jewels of rock 'n' roll film."
4,Good product as a first MP3 player,"I purchased this product online as my first MP3 player after reading the high reviews from CNET and Consumer's Digest. I'm not one to follow the trend of buying the Ipod or Zune because of their popularity I prefer getting the best product for the best price, and I have no regrets. However a few months of having it, I had to upgrade it for the new Zune because it couldn't hold all my music, plus at the time I purchased it, the wall charger was not available so I could only recharge it through my computer's ethernet port. Overall a good MP3 player, I would highly recommend it for preteens..."
2,It was great until it froze.,"I was really enjoying this player. I brought it to the gym with me and played a recording of my white noise machine so I wouldn't have to listen to Fox News. However, it froze on me today. I suspect the reason is because the audiobook that I downloaded from my public library had expired. Why this should cause the player to freeze, I have no idea. I use the paperclip thing and turn it back on and it says restoring library but then goes back to the same picture of the expired library book. Also, I can't seem to charge it now either. Well, my wife and I have used it for 2 years, so I guess that's it. It was fun while it lasted."
4,nice sound,"Really will hold about 300 songs at very high quality of sound. Pretty easy to use once you get it set up. I use rhapsody service and it functions well with that. the ear buds are a bit large, but have great sound. There are some times when it will have to be reset, and if you are using rhapsody ""to go"" you will have to ""relicense"" any tracks that are from that service. Really just involves hooking it up and then right clicking on the zen icon on left and only takes a few seconds, but won't work well if you do not reacquire license occasionally. Biggest complaint is that if you are impatient it can freeze up. I have since learned to not be impatient with it and it works much more smoothly. Holds a charge pretty well by my account. You really should go to amazon and purchase one of the skin/armband combos that go with it."
5,Great for exercise...,"I've owned about 10 different MP3 players over the years, and have sent a fair number of them to an early grave due to exercise-related stresses (meaning impact, repetitive-motion-injury, or water/sweat damage). I've had the new Zen V for a few months now, and it seems to be the best bet so far based on small size / light weight, solid state memory rather than hard drive, excellent sound quality, and some of the most exercise-friendly controls I've seen. The battery life isn't stellar, but given the size of the unti it's better than you might expect. If you are OK with the 2/4 GB storage capacity, I would recommend this player without reservation."
2,"Warning, Device Contains Cancer Causing Agent,",his is the exact warning description written on the 4th page of the use manual:Warning: The cord(s) included with this product may contain chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. WASH HANDS AFTER HANDLING.WTF??! Why isn't this warning listed on their advertisement? I would not have bought it if I knew about it. Do not buy this product if it is a concern to you.But Overall it is not a bad MP3 player.
4,"Fun and Functional, but...","I really like the features and interface. I wasn't happy about the number of new software programs put on my computer and I didn't know what they were until it was finished.However, I had it less than 24 hours when the joystick broke. Honestly, it seems almost too light and flimsy to last very long. My camera has a joystick about the same size that is much more robust and has worked for almost 2 years. I'm getting the MP3 player replaced, but... that doesn't help when the joystick is still apparently quite flimsy."
3,"So far, not good","I do like this little player, if I can get it to work on Vista. I've tried for days with tech support and good-old-stand-by google with no luck. It works great with XP. Then after 5 days of ownership, it just went dead. Nothing. It won't wake up or take a charge."
5,Buy It,"Like I said with the larger version, all creative products outperform all I pod products and cost so much less, and are still packed with great features, for the money you can't do better. At the time of this review I have owned 6 creative products and have never been let down by any of them."
2,You Cannot Replace this Battery,"Upon recieving this unit I noticed that the case appeared to be sealed. I was going to purchase a seprate battery so I had a backup when not near AC power or a computer.Any battery replacement has to be done by the factory. This is a horrible alternative and puts this unit at the bottom of my list.Who wants to send in a device to the factory for something this simple. Unless you are willing to put up with not having your unit for a period of time, paying shipping, paying the service charge, and not having a backup on hand, do not buy this."
1,not worth it to me,I bought 2 of these for my daughters last Christmas. Within 6 months my oldest daughter's screen had gone completely black & as of today my youngest daughter's is 3/4 of the way black. I would not recommend this item. It was going to cost more to have Creative repair them then to just buy new ones so I opted for the Sony. I'm much more pleased. I will not purchase another Creative MP3 player.
4,Good little player,I like that I can store so many songs on it. It was easy to set up and use. The only thing I don't like is that the battery needs to be recharged quite often.
2,Joystick...not on an MP3 Player,The little joystick that is used to scroll through the menus is too delicate and breaks under regular use. I used my fingernails to scroll through the menu while jogging and it broke. Now I can't scroll down.
4,Not bad.,"This is my first MP3 player, so I have nothing to which to compare it. However, it does what I want it to: play the sound media that I put on it.Downsides:*Ear pieces are rather uncompfortable - but I imagine all are.*The controls are tiny - I have to use my fingernail to change tracks.*The charger is through USB, so you must have the computer on to charge it.*The text doesn't wrap on the screen so for very long title, you must wait for it to scroll to the right for you.Upsides:*Despite what the included literature says, you DON'T need to install the irritating software. Instead, simply plug it in to a USB, and it gets treated like a drive - I like that very much, as it keeps down the amount of software I need.*It is small (though not as small as the Nano, which is good. As it is the controls are too small for me."
5,great buy for the price,"This is the second Zen I've owned...hope someone else is enjoying the first (lost it on a flight to San Francisco). For a non-techie like me, I find it easy to use, 2 GB is more than adequate, plays for more than 12 hours on a charge, and the radio is a plus. Interface with the computer is super easy. I can't bear the thought of a workout without it, or a hostel stay as I can drown out the snorers. Definitely recommend it for the money."
2,Great player until it died at 4 months of use,"I loved it... until it just plain died. I used it with Rhapsody, and I loved the freedom it gave me to select any music that I could possibly think of.But, it died after 4 months. R.I.P.I think I'm going to try the Sansa."
2,Save receipt,"I bought this about 4 months ago, and it no longer works. I liked it for ease of use and sound quality. It had to be reset frequently, and after the last reset it remained frozen, and then, just died. I checked and the warranty for labor is good for only 90 days. I've lost the receipt, but since the labor warranty is only for 90 days I doubt it would be worth fixing. I replaced a Creative Zen Touch with this. I had the Touch for three trouble-free years. This is much smaller and much poorer quality. If you buy it, save the receipt because you'll need it."
4,Creative Zen V Plus 2 GB Portable Media Player (Black/Green),"This product is good so far, but it is to early to give an appropriate review."
1,Do Not Buy,"This is the first time I have been inspired to write a review for any product. I bought a Creative Zen V Plus for my wife as a gift on our wedding day. It was about the biggest waste of $102.00 ever. The player constantly freezes. We've sent it back once to be replaced (and of course, that took 8 a solid weeks). Since we got it back, it has frozen three more times. Twice we were able to let the battery run down and it would turn on again after charging, but once we had to reset the whole player and reload all the music onto the player again.Overall, the product is a waste of money and time. Buy whatever kind of mp3 player you want, but I would not waste my money on this product."
4,Early Greene crime novel captivates,"The assassination of an influential public figure leads to a complicated web of betrayal and murder. As the double-crossed assassin hunts down his former employers, a policeman and his fiancee find themselves on opposite sides of the fray. Graham Greene's writing style is very cinematic here; many passages played out effortlessly in my mind's eye like scenes from a vintage film noir. It almost makes me think that it may have easy for Carol Reed to direct the classic ""The Third Man"" (also based on a Greene story). Greene is not satisfied with simply providing an involving plot; he gives his characters depth and dimension and interesting dialogue as well. Recommended."
2,Should have read the reviews first....,"I gave this 2 stars because after all, I really like these songs!!Otherwise....I had this cd in the mid-90s and I LOVED IT!!! I purchased this download because it has the same ""album cover"". I should have taken the time to listen to the clips and read the reviews. For the songs that are my faves, they ARE NOT the same versions that were on my cd.Definitely disappointed... but at least it was only 5 bucks.If you are considering this purchase and are already familiar with these songs - PLEASE listen prior to buying."
1,"""Dont let me get this DVD!""",What can i say about pink?you see her enough on MTV so why whould you buy this DVD single?
3,author messes with reader's mind,"Having already read most of Vidal's novels, plus Palimpsest, I was a little baffled by the time I'd reached the end of Two Sisters. The basic plot is that the narrator (V) is reading through a film script and notes written by a friend from the past (Eric); V realises that he didn't know Eric as well as he thought. Along the way, the usual Vidal subjects appear: death, sex, history, the decline of the novel... What is baffling is that at times V seems quite clearly to be Vidal himself; at others, we are assured that this is a work of fiction. I found myself distracted by speculations as to what was ""real"" and what not. Presumably Vidal's point, but ultimately it did hamper my enjoyment of a thoughtful, intriguing book. (Incidentally, readers drawn solely by promises on the book's cover of ""scandal"" and ""taboo"" will probably be very disappointed)."
2,"A good book, now ruined in latest edition.","Why tamper with a successful work? Why, for reasons of political correctness, of course. I like the way they snuck that in in the introduction to the current edition."
5,recommended,"Ignore the pseudo-intellectual ""descriptive linguists"" pandering to the illiterate. (Pseudo-intellectualism is a form of anti-intellectualism.) If you want to learn to write well follow the advice of two who write superlatively well themselves. Get hold of ""The Elements of Style"". Read it through. Keep it for reference.Also recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
3,Not enough detail coverage for animation,"Animation is not just about moving the character, but adjusting his or her emotions. While I find the book useful, it lacks the full description of walking you through to do a full character animation (including voice, movements, using the cycler, expressions. It should explain how to measure the walk or run sequences, timelines, non-linear animations."
4,Great Note and References but is there better,"I bought this Bible after owning a hardcover NIV for some time and Do like Ryries format and layout. The maps, charts, and background info is very nicely organized. The notes are not 75% of the page as in other Bibles and hit most of the issues however are lacking in some areas. Two of my major quams are the fact the margins are almost non existant and writing in it is very difficult and the back contains a thick section of Ryries Theology notes. My opinion, if it is a study Bible make room to write in it and make notes. And if you want Ryrie's theology, buy Basic Theology. I have heard of another NASB that has both strongs and vines and is comparably priced. But still not bad for the value."
2,"Don't buy this cd, you'll be disappointed.","Considereing myself I fan of both punk rock and hair rock, I must warn you, this album is neither of the above. I'll give the artists credit for putting very unique spins on the songs, however, I really don't want to hear lounge and swing version covers of these rocking songs, from some of the better punk bands around.If you want a good punk cover cd check out Punk Goes Metal (which is unbelievable) or Before You Were Punk 1 or 2."
3,DVD convenience with VHS quality,"The price is right so I guess I can't complain too much. For me this is a guilty pleasure sort of movie, and it was finally time to upgrade from my VHS copy to the high quality of DVD. The only problem, my VHS copy is higher quality than the DVD picture and sound. I gave this film 3 stars because its still funny and the price is very good, but the quality drops it down a couple of stars."
4,Outrageous TV parody,"This movie is nothing but pure outrageous tv parody. By today's standards it's relatively tame (with the exception of the politically incorrect themes),but that's because television has changed. When KFM was released it was dead on target and one of a handful of tv parody films. The first film by the guys responsible for the Airplane! and Naked Gun films, it was a preview of things to come. Unfortunately, in these PC times films like this can't be made. And I think that's a shame. Somewhere down the line we forgot how to laugh at ourselves. Have a good laugh."
5,Old Classic,"This was one of my favorite movies as a teen. I watched it with my 20 something daughters, and they thought it was a hoot!"
5,If you have little or no taste THIS IS IT!!!,"I can't tell you how hard I laughed during this movie. It's not really a movie though. It's a bunch of skits. Some are only a couple minutes and some are like 15 mins. If you're looking for a movie that is assured to make you laugh so hard you can't breathe, this is it!"
5,A Beautiful CD!!!!,"This cd is exciting and fresh. Tracks such as ""I Want to Kill You"" give you the chills beacuse they are so haunting. Other Tracks like ""Spoiled and Rotten"" as well as ""Cocoon"" are so amazing that you can't forget them! The Lead singers voice is so unique, and the bands music is a cross between alternative with a mix of arabian. All the songs here are really great, and this cd is worth every penny."
4,good book,"I would say that, sure this is a good book to buy. We haven't used it yet, because it didn't come with a wine label remover, which is the only thing I would suggest changing. Make it a package deal with whatever the product is to remove labels. Have fun drinking your wine and filling up the book!"
3,Different,"The CD has a wide rage of music,very creative.My only regret is that she did not use more producers."
1,the voice has moments but overall the material is lacking,"caught out there shows something, but her voice overall is being played to the same old current beat.the material is what is hurting her here.i like her edge but the concept overall is being done to death."
3,2/14?,"For some reason my CD player would not play all the tracks either there is something wrong with it or it has an high sense of music...I opt for the first. Having read some of the reviewes I was amazed to see how much she is appreciated, I can only think that much of it is in the way she apprears and not based on her music which I find a bit repetitious. Don't get me wrong ""Good Stuff"" and ""caught out there"" are among the best tracks I have listned to this year but for the time being that it : ( ""wouldn't you agree"""
5,Olivia is TOTALLY HOT!,"This was Olivia's very first attempt into the real pop world,and she entered it with great sucess. Remember such great hits as""A little more Love"",Deeper Than the night"" and ""Toatlly Hot""? All eventually became unforgettable hits.This album shows a more daring,a more raunchy side to the""cute""Olivia Newton-John but she sure proves with Totally Hot that she is as capable with Pop as with Country and love ballads.The album also includes a few songs that Olivia wrote herself,she proves to be quite talented at writing too:))"
5,Olivia's best work!,"'Please Don't Keep Me Waiting' is, I feel, Olivia's best song. I love the eerieness, pure 70's. This album shows how Olivia can sing anything; rock (A Little More Love), country (Round and Round), and everything in between (Totally Hot). Love this album!!!"
2,Nope,"My baby likes the mac n cheese in the jars. So, when I couldn't find the jars at the store I was at, I tried these mac n cheeses thinking they were the same. They are not. She doesn't like these. Maybe it is a texture issue mainly as these are much runnier than the jar kind. Looking for more mac n cheese jars."
4,Informative,"I'm a swing trader, so llistening to other traders and their experiences is insightful. As a trader, I constantly educating myself to sharping my skills and give me the edge."
3,A humorous read,"The book ws fun to read. Nothing serious, just a lot of humor in a fantasy story. It was exactly what I thought it would be when I bought it. Silly, fun and nothing serious in a little fantasy tale. The write up called it that, and I felt it delivered that."
1,NO NO NO,the episodes are not really good and they have no importance at all... i didn't like it and nobody among my friends did either... not recommended
3,"Looks good, works good, Lasts one year.","I have a lake front rental place in the Poconos(PA). I buy this cover every year. The Pedal boat comes out early Spring(April) and get put away late Fall(October). And by late Fall the cover is ripped. I'd like to find a longer lasting cover, but I have no guarantee that a cover that is 3 times more expensive will last 3 times longer."
2,"Almost works, but not at all waterproof","This cover does stay on pretty well on my Dolphin Sun Slider 5 seater, but its only slightly water resistant and not even remotely waterproof. Basically when it rains, the water pools up in the recessed areas where your feet go, below the seats. The problem is that the water that pools up simply leaks right through, and fills up inside the boat. If it rains heavily, the material simply loses any water resistance and becomes soaking wet like a wet towel. I'm not talking monsoons that last for days, just a typical rain shower that lasts less than an hour.This cover basically falls under the ""you get what you pay for"" category. If you can store the boat out of the rain, it works well for keeping dirt and debris out of the boat. But if it rains heavily, you will get water inside the boat. I don't recommend this cover if you want to keep your boat both clean and dry. I'll be looking for a replacement to this cover."
5,products from amazon,i recently purchased the pedal boat cover and i was very pleased with this product. it fit my boat perfectly. i now have 2 more orders from amazon and their price is very reasonable. i am well pleased with amazon and i will continue to purchase items from this company
3,Paddel Boat Cover,Works good as long as you have it tight or have something in the seat to keep the center up. During hard rains the water likes to puddle on top of it and it will leak threw.
4,worth the price,"Good material, keeps boat dry, blew up an oldinner=tube to put in the front seat to keepwater pockets to a minimum.Cover did blow off in a rather high wind.Will try a Velcrol fix as another reviewer revommended.hilcntry"
2,paddle boat cover,"Very light weight, and not very strong. As I recall it wasn't very expensive, so I guess I got my money's worth, but don't expect more than one season out of this cover."
3,"Classy, erotic, and naive - in black & white!","Fourth Sex is the true gem of the Metzger canon. It has two genuinely erotic dance sequences that'll rate high to fans of tiki culture, as near-nude actresses bop to bongo jazz. One's in a net hammock, the other's a jungle gal who tosses her hair a lot. As is typical for low-market art house fare of this sort there are stock footage cram-ins that have zilch to do with the ""plot"" but are delicious accent pieces. Gratuitously inserted are clips of two French pop bands lipsynching twist numbers so chewy they'd gag Austin Powers, and a riot at a French concert (Stones? nah - too early). The aforementioned ""plot"" has to do with arty decadents who paint each other in the nude, have a toga party, and natter interminably between flashpoints. For those who feel culturally aligned to Betty Page, Martin Denny music, and port wine cheese, this film's a major buffett."
5,Great kitten food,My cats just love this kitten food. It doesn't upset their bellies and has all of the nutrition they need for a good price.
3,a turn for worse,a great humorous profile about a recovering alcholic.i did not have many burst of laughter but was on the edge of it.a novel about think before i leap.
3,greed fails in the end,"mystery house by kathleen norris is a rather low-key story about the whereabouts of a priceless diamond(the ""ked anna"" diamond-it is called). it belonged to a very wealthy woman who,may or may not be the person she seems to be and the ""mystery"" of mystery house is revealed at the end of the book. there are several characters in the book that i have seen before like:older female companion(losing her looks and grip with reality),the handsome doctor/boyfriend who has all the answers,and the mentally unstable/misunderstood distant relative seeking acceptance.(yes,i have read this before)and as with her other books,kathleen norris is a good writer-this book is no exception. a good book for a rainy afternoon."
1,Wrong movie sent by 2 different suppliers,I ordered this movie from 2 different suppliers and in each case I received a movie called Everybody Sing with Judy Garland. Which has Fanny Brice in it but no Hedy Lamarr...
3,"elitist, misogynistic and dated, but if you can get past that...","It's like plucking through a blackberry patch on a too-bright day, plenty of juicy berries if you don't mind the burrs. Gardner has a lot of valuable advice, both concrete and abstract, and can state them in a clear and concise manner, but you have to disengage from the fact that he is product of his time, a time that allowed the denigration of women as intellectual and creative beings long after racism was no longer acceptable. He also states as fact that genre writing isn't worth anybody's time, so if you're writing science fiction, mystery, horror or women's fiction, you might want to steer clear of this one. However, if your skin is thick enough and you have a keen enough sense for separating the helpful from the not so much, there are some words of wisdom in there."
4,Great insights and counsel to writers,"Gardner comes across as a realist and an inspiration to writers. This is not a step-by-step book about how to write a novel. It is more of a big picture approach to developing the mindset, skills and discipline to become a novelist.Gardner illustrates the ingredients to writing novels and to being a novelist. His examples of his own writing experiences are the crux of this book. He has been through the angst and exhiliration of writing and shares his insights in this book.He clearly conveys that writing takes discipline, skill, perseverance and teachability. He elaborates on these areas in the book.Overall, the book is inspiring and educational. It is not drawn out or wordy. He gets to the point and keeps it short, so it is very helpful throughout."
2,"Only good for large, heavy, sturdy packages","I run a small home business where I sell vintage clothing. I prefer to ship in boxes rather than padded envelopes and hate wasting time fighting with tape and scissors. I thought this would be handy but it did not meet my needs. The gun when loaded with tape it very heavy (and huge!) and if you try to use it on a standard, small, or non corrugated cardboard box you will just completely smash the box. This is great if you are moving or frequently packaging stuff in large, sturdy, corrugated, heavy boxes that can stand several pounds of pressure. But since I use smaller light weight boxes, I found myself still using scissors and this was reduced to a very expensive tape dispenser. I'm back to square one! Two stars because it can be useful for big heavy boxes but that is it."
2,pretty lame,"CH knows about descriptions. and some of the ideas can be good. but all in all, this doesn't deliver. there are three stories here worth reading. otherwise...no. there's some blend of horror and humour, good details and lack of details. CH should have focused on writing less and better stories, and keep a thread, humorous or horrible. some of the stories are even lousy, no ideas or descriptions. it's not enough if your father is a vampire. it's not a story. something else must happen."
2,"No picures in kindle version, very disappointed","Everywhere it should have a picture in this book on the kindle version it has a note: ""To view this image, refer to the print version of this title"". I thought it was a problem with my book and went on a chat with Amazon, they told me it was a decision of the publisher to hold the content from the kindle edition. I think this is absurd since kindle books aren't exactly cheap. Now I don't know when I buy a kindle book exacly what I will receive and Amazon (at least in this chat) said they are not responsible for what they are selling.This review is not about the book content."
3,Text as Interesting as Title,"This is a book that is a good starting place for students of comp/rhet. It gives a fairly accurate feel for the discussion of the last 37 years and introduces the major voices of the comp/rhet movement.That being said, I have to note that it is one of the dullest reads I've encountered in a very long time. Harris spends so much time detailing every voice and every argument since 1966 that he loses the energy that is evident in the writings of authors such as Elbow or Hacker or Bean.This is really too bad, because comp/rhet studies is a challenging and growing field that more writing students and teachers of writers should be aware of---if for no other reason that it impacts the whole system of learning to write."
4,Works fine.,"I ordered this for holding my Coffee Pod filter packs. I make mine stronger than some others may, so the holder doesn't hold as many as it said it should, but that's fine, I can get about a dozen at a time. The only other issue I have is the little wire rack that you use to lift the filters out is pretty flimsy, and it has no side support for the filter pods, so if you lift it up too high out of the canister, the pods tip over. Not a deal breaker for sure, and it looks great next to the My Invento Coffee Maker that uses these pods. Great price, and was received quickly and in perfect shape."
2,hole is too big,"I didn't cut the prongs at all but the kibble falls out too easily. I recommend the waggle toy instead because the hole is smaller and kibble is a little more challenging to get out. This does look slightly sturdier than the waggle toy, but we've had the waggle toy for months and it's holding up fine."
5,Samson Loves It,"Our big baby (85lb Labradoodle) has a tendency to get bored in the evenings when we get home if we don't give him enough attention. This can be especially annoying when it's dinner time. Fortunately, we just load up a few treats and dog food into the squirrel and he's good to go for a little while until we can give him the attention he needs. We ordered the large for him and it's just big enough and just hard enough to keep him interested. We're on our second squirrel because we weren't careful with the first and Samson took it off somewhere never to be seen again. We're being a little more careful with this one and making sure that he doesn't take it outside."
1,My dog has no interest in this,My border collie is not amused with this particular product. Not like a kong where I can smear PB in it for him to get out (and occupy his time so I can get things accomplished. He does like the other Busy Buddy toy where he pushes it around with his nose dispensing the food. I can't recommend this product but the brand has other choices that were better for my dog and I.
4,Great for power chewers,"We've had this for about six months or so and both of my super power chewers, a Lab mix puppy and an adult German Shepherd both love it. They have a tough time getting the treats out so it keeps them busy far longer than any other treat toy that we've tried. It's also the only toy that has shown no damage in all the time we've had it. Toys typically last 5 mins to max a week in our house, and don't keep them busy for long. The only downside is that because it is harder for them to get treats out, they tend to get bored or frustrated and give up after a while unless there's something extra special in there. Overall it's one of the best ""busy"" toys if you want to keep your pups occupied for any length of time and it's very durable."
5,One of the best dog toys I've ever purchased!,"We have a 1.5 year old JRT. She absolutely loves this toy. The best thing about it are the little prongs inside the inner hole. They make it difficult for treats to come out. She has to work to get the treats out, and it keeps her busy for hours on end. We've purchased other toys; IMHO, this one is hands-down awesome. She throws it up and it wobbles across the floor. It's a bit noisy, but that's alright with us. Sometimes, a treat falls out; usually, however, it doesn't. That really gets her motor revved up! ;)"
1,never received,I was required to pick a star for rating- so I picked one but I did not get the product-I had ordered the toys for my dogs= days later received a message that the items never shipped and a refund would be made to my account. NO explanation was ever given- no opportunity to substitute another product.
1,Total frustration for my dog,"We bought Squirrel Dude and the Waggle for our 30# dog. She is TOTALLY FRUSTRATED with trying to get the treats out and now won't even look at the toys. Putting her kibble in there is pointless - she's not interested in working this hard for food that she gets daily anyway. I had to use tweezers and my arthritic fingers to get the treats out, and they were small treats.I really want my money back. My dog looks at me like she's been duped and I feel the same way.Maybe this works for LARGE, BIG TIME CHEWERS but sure doesn't work for my dog."
2,Dog doesn't like it,"Unfortunately, my 7-month old Weimaraner hasn't taken a liking to this toy. She loves her Kong toys, but for some reason, she has no interest in this toy, no matter what I put in it."
3,Not so good for lazzy dogs,"I was very excited about this stuff for my dog, but I got disappointed. My dog is very lazzy so he loves to bite the squirrel 2 or 3 times and that's all. He tries to get the food moving the squirrel but he get bored soon. I think it is perfect if your dog is more active than mine :("
5,Fun and Satisfying Chew Toy,"In my estimation, the Premier Squirrel Dude is the best designed treat filled toy. The plastic is strong enough to withstand strong and extensive chewing and the hole which has three little teeth (that can be trimmed if necessary) keeps all kinds of kibble treats from just falling out. With other toys like this I had to resort to expensive fillers or high fat substances (like peanut butter) to keep our Jack Russell from emptying the toy too quickly."
2,In little pieces all over my house,"My dog is a powerful chewer. I thought this toy may be tough enough for her, I was wrong. I keep finding little pieces of purple plastic all over my house."
3,Squirrel Dude,These are a nice alternative to a Kong. You can adjust how fast the treats come out which is great for many dogs. They also bounce and roll great!!
2,My German Shepherd won't even touch this,"I hate to give such a negative review, but this was a waste of money for me.The toy has a terrible oil/baby oil/rubber-y smell to it, no matter how many times I've washed it (and I've tried washing out the smell a lot!)I've tried stuffing it with treats, peanut butter, cheese, etc, but my dog won't touch this toy at all. He does have a super-sensitive nose, so maybe that's why???I'm disappointed; I'll stick with the black Kong toys from now on."
3,Its ok,"At this point in the game I know what I want in a book about uniforms.This really isn't it. Sure it has high quality photos and rare examples but It just isn't what Imlooking for. My interest is mainly combat, camouflage and field-made items. This only has a few combat uniforms and They are very ""by the book"" if you will.Overall this book didn't do it for me but this authors other book about the Waffen SS is much better. Check that one out."
5,this product...,i cannot live without patchouli. i would die without it in some way or form. this is the only thing that actually treats patches of dry skin and clears them up. thanks.
3,Patchouli perfume oil,"I love patchouli in general, but for whatever reason I'm not totally in love with the scent of this particular oil. That's not to say I dislike it, and I wear use this perfume oil regularly. I'm just not sure I would buy it again, maybe I will try a different scent. My only other complaint is that the color of the oil seems pretty dark, I'm sometimes worried it will rub off on light clothing."
3,Does what it promises but the smell = (:'-O),It's wayyyyy to floral for me. Sharply so. This doesnt smell very sexy in my opinion; it's a nice smell but way too sweet & flowery- Even after I rubbed it into skin & let it sit. I even put it on my armpits lol (that was the best smelling option :X) long lasting & noticeable but not overpowering.
2,I wanted to love this Soo bad!!,"I had read So many positive reviews on the Egyptian Goddess"" scent,and it sounded so enticing!While it arrived very quickly,..as soon as I opened the bottle..I smelled what seemed like a pine sol scent or some kind of cleanser,I had also read in some reviews that the bottle just might need to be exposed to the air a little to really bring out the true scent,I gave it 2 days on my skin,which you can not get off for about 2 days any way,even after scrubbing in the shower,..seemed to just keep getting stronger and started to give me a headache.So as I really tried and wanted to love Egyptian Goddess,..it was just not for me.""as I sit here still with the scent on my wrist""unable to get it off "" took another sniff, and ugh.."
1,disappointed,This product was very disappointing to me. The smell is light and does not have that musky smell of sandlewood. It took a hot shower and lots of scrubing to remove the oil from my skin.
2,I should have listened!!!,"I read the other reviews stating that this perfume was too faint, and that you couldn't smell the fragrance. I should have paid attention to it. But, having said that, I am also one who likes a strong fragrance. This one is extremely mild but pleasant. It's a pleasant fragrance, I just should have saved my money. I just assumed maybe it was just the difference in chemistry and maybe it would work for me....it didn't."
5,Hands down THE BEST!,"There isn't an essential oil out there that can beat this one! I've been wearing Egyptian Goddess for over a decade, and I never get sick of it. Once you try it you'll agree."
1,Smells like old lady,Thought it would smell musky vanillaish but I was wrong it smells like old lady perfume and is to strong
5,yummy,"This scent is absolutely delicious! Auric Blends is my new favorite brand, all of their perfume oils are amazing and they mix beautifully to make your own signature scent, but they also work wonders all on their own. This one is a white amber musk combination, its fresh, and has soft floral notes of Egyptian Goddess (my #1 fave) and also slightly spicy but sweet base notes of sandalwood. It's worn well in the summer because your body heat changes it quite a bit to make a lusciously sweet and sexy, truly unique fragrance."
2,Disappointing,"The scent is barely detectable. It's as if I'm not wearing anything at all, and I have a very sensitive nose. The ""oil"" is very sticky/gummy on the skin too."
2,Artificial Strawberry,"I bought the vanilla scent and upon opening it for the first time, I noticed a pervasive artificial strawberry scent, similar to that of the original Strawberry Shortcake doll made in the mid 1980s. I could still smell the vanilla fragrance under the strawberry, and I thought that maybe the scent was from the packaging rather than from the oil so I applied some of the oil. The strawberry scent was still present, and did not fade with time. Just to be sure I wasn't imagining things, I tried the oil again today and it still has the artificial and unpleasant strawberry scent."
1,Defective,"Honestly, you can tell it's a nice-smelling perfume because of the occasional hints of fragrance that come out of the bottle, but they're so rare that you're really left with what some other reviewers described as car oil smell, which I guess is like the basis oil the perfume uses. I don't know, I threw it out. Not buying any more Auric Blends."
3,Could be better,Initially smells like rose. Didn't seem to last very long on the skin. Maybe need to use lots of it. I only rolled on a little so as not to be overpowering. Could be good for someone.
3,Was not crazy about this one...,"I expected a calming, natural smelling lavender and this isn't it. I think it's either missing something or has something else in it besides lavender that I don't like.I LOVE Auric Blends though. My favorite scent from them isAuric Blends Egyptian Goddess Roll-On Perfume 1/3 oz.If you're looking for a calming, night time lavender smell to relax you and put you to sleep, this is not it. This is better for an everyday perfume if you just like the scent of lavender."
2,not so tropical...,"So I just received my blck coconut roll-on, and was so excited to try it because I LOVE all things coconut, and I'm disappointed to say the least. Its almost sickeningly sweet, and I really don't sense that much coconut. It almost smells syrupy. I put it on though because oils can smell different on the body then it does in the jar. 4 hours later and its still pretty sweet...not as bad as it was when I first put it on , but definitely smelling even less like coconut. I thought I would be getting a true tropical warm scent from the description... (pure coconut with a bit of spice) but, alas, I go right back to the bubble_gum scents of junior high when I smell this. Does anyone have any recommendations for a TRUE coconut scent? (Nutty,creamy, musky, and warm smelling) I'm willing to try anything! But id rather stick with the all natural oils for their longevity ."
1,"Bottle leakage, grrrr","I love the smell of this perfume, but I am very unhappy with the product I received. I have purchased Auric blends at my local Whole Foods in the past and wanted to try the ""Love"" scent, so I ordered it from Amazon. I am deeply disappointed by my purchase. It seems as though there was manufacturing error with the bottle (perhaps the rolling ball was too small?) and over a couple of days the entire contents of the bottle leaked out into my purse. Now my purse smells nice, but I have an empty bottle of perfume and a large oil stain on my bag. Not happy at all. Hoping the company will replace the bottle with one that doesn't leak. If only they would replace my purse as well. Ugh."
4,Easy To Take With You Anywhere!,I heard about this product in a magazine article somewhere. I was pleased with the price and was thrilled with the wide selection. Decided to go with what I am familiar with and love it. I take it with me to work out. It's strong enough to rid me of any sweaty smell (no time to shower) and is so small I can take it anywhere.
1,forbidden desire; YUCK,'forbidden desire' reeked of old lady smell it was horrible! but Im interested in trying 'egyptian goddess' does it smell bad too??
1,NASTY,This stuff doesn't smell anything like sandalwood. It smells like old 1970's Avon thats been in storage for 40 years. GROSS. I would give it zero stars if I could.
1,Bad bottle? Smells like rubber.,"Maybe I got a bad bottle? This smells like plastic or rubber. I smell a faint musk underneath, but the predominant note is rubber. Too bad - after all the great reviews I was thinking that this would smell wonderful. Maybe it just doesn't mix well with my body chemistry, or as I said earlier, maybe I just got a bad batch."
1,yuck!,"This product arrived open and had leaked out on everything else in the box. It smells like old lady perfume and is very overpowering. I had to throw the whole bottle out and wash my hands several times to remove the smell. It also gave me a headache as soon as I opened the box, it even stunk up my whole recycling box!"
2,Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess,"I don't like it at all, it has a good staying power though but is a flowery scent, not very strong but you can feel it. If you are into flowery scents then try it."
1,THIS DOESN'T CLEAN,"THIS PRODUCT IS SO OVER RATED THAT IT'S FUNNY!!IT DOESN'T CLEAN ANY BETTER THAN WATER!!I TRIED IT ON THE CAR AND THE HOUSE WINDOWS AND THEN THROUGH IT AWAY!IF YOU WANT A SUPER GLASS CLEANER,GO TO; [...]YOU WILL LOVE THIS!"
5,Magneto and Professor X both read it. You should too.,I hope that the use of The Once and Future King in X2 inspires a lot of new readers for one of the greatest fantasy stories of all time.Rick Norwood
3,"Great book, but don't buy this edition!","Search here on Amazon for ""The Once and Future King, Complete Edition"", and buy that one. It's the only edition that includes ""The Book of Merlyn"", the fifth volume that T. H. White intended as the conclusion of ""The Once and Future King""."
5,A great read,This is the kind of book that should be read at the different stages of life. It has something different to offer everyone.
5,A classic,"This is the book that turned me on to history, fantasy and classical literature, and I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for it. The second half however, is depressing, dark and grim. If you can find it, TH White also wrote a book called Mistress Masham's Repose that I highly recommend."
2,Don't buy into the hype.,"Coming into reading this book I was under the false impression that it was going to be an enjoyable read. That went out the window rather quickly. I might have liked this book, had I been born in England 60 years ago and had an intricate knowledge of obscure old English references concerning their medieval period and items contained within. However, I have to say that I read through a few chapters of White's novel where I was left with no sense of what had just happened.He goes into intricate explanations of scenery, events, and items that last for pages. This in itself is not bad, however, White seems to have been going through the Old English Book of archaic terms while he was doing this. Not a fun read, you might as well break out your dictionary and thesaurus because that's the only way you're going to understand what White is describing."
2,Longest Book Ever Written (Almost),"The First Chapter went pretty quickly; however, the second was the longest and most boring chapter in the entire book- it took me at least a month to finish the first few pages of it. It becomes very complicated and confusing and I had to read it over and over again to actually understand what was going on. Of course, my opinion is biased because I am forced to read it for school for the summer. But anyway, it seems like a fairly good book. I gave it two stars because Chapter 2 was awful."
2,Don't read unless you are a SERIOUS READER,"I read this book when I was thirteen and it was way over my head, It wasn't as much that the context was to hard, I just didn't have the attention span to read to much detail about certain things. I also found the book very uneventful. However, I could see how someone at a much higher level of reading would enjoy the book. It offers great in detail writing and can be a good read. I would not read it again till I am at least 18."
4,Excellent Book!,This is a great book that can literally take you back to the time of King Arthur and Sir Kay!
2,I really didn't like this one,"It all starts out with King Arthur's child hood. He wasn't really a king when he was seven through sixteen. It was just him playing around with his friends like normal people, they did not get into trouble a lot but there were being pretty good kids. The book has a lot of details about medieval life. More details than I care to know.The real story starts out with the sword in the stone. No one could pull it out but Arthur. Then he met the Queen of Air and darkness also known as Morgan le Fay. Arthur goes through a lot like the Ill made Knight and The Candle in The Wind. I think it got a bit more interesting by then, but I really didn't care about the characters. I really do not like the book because I am not that interested in medieval things. I think the author needs to rephrase most of the book. This book wasn't to my tastes at all."
4,I couldn't put it down even if I wanted to,"This story is I think one of the best reads I have ever read. It was definetly not the kind of book you could put down or read half way through and stop. It's the kind of book that urges you to read more and you do. Once and Future King was full of everything from action to adventure to even comedy and drama I found so many different genre in this one book. I liked this book because it took a boring subject like the life of King Arthur and made it come to life with jousts, magic, quests, and a love triangle that will make your head spin. Though i will admit it does get slow at some parts but once your past those your ok. This book is a must read and should be on everyones shelf."
5,Arthurian Fantasy at it's finest!,"This is a book on my list of my favorites of all time! The first time I read it I fell in love with the crootchety Merlin, the bumbling King Pellinore, and (most of all) the young, naive King-to-be, Arthur (or wart!). This is a must-read for every fan of the Arthurian legends! Definately a classic, and the only book I've ever read for a class and loved!"
3,Not too bad,Not the best I have seen......but definetely not the worst. A good value for the price.....with much more actual street racing then all the rest.
5,I love it!!!,"I loved this unique, and spiritually enriching album. The album will lift you up on any bad day and is relaxing on any good. I think anyone could get into this CD with open arms, and be a better person because of it."
5,Too funny,I love Adam sandler movies. I can't believe he went this far in the movie but it was pretty funny. Definitely a bit ronchy...even for an Adam sandler movie
1,That's My Boy,"Very ruanchy and lame New York style humor, don't waste your money, this is one of Sandler's worst movies yet."
2,annoying,"really just a boring, brutish movie. i think it was trying too hard to be funny. maybe it's meant to appeal to the 14-year old in all of us but it just didn't do it for me."
1,The worst,"If I could rate this zero stars, I would. This video is juvenile, moronic, vulgar, and lame. A number of scenes were just plain disgusting. Honestly, I don't know why I rented it, except it was .99 cents. I don't find Adam Sandler funny in the least. I was tempted to end the misery midway, but I did pay for it, so I stuck it out. It didn't get any better. Do yourself a favor, and save the rental fee for something - anything - else."
3,AAHH,Its alright. I still watch any Sandler. You never know what will hit. I hate when he does this voice too long but the story is pretty funny.
3,a little disappointed,Both actors are great and I think movie could have been a lot better...Sadly it COULD have been and wasn't. It felt like they were trying to be as off the wall as they could and when they couldn't be as off the wall as they could someone else was...the hotel room...come on...really? It was worth the 99 cents I paid Amazon to rent it....I wouldn't pay more.
1,bad,"that was a horrible show ,I want my two hours back.THose are two hours I will not get back... Adam bad"
3,o.k.,"movies was not as good as the previews,adam sandler is the man of comedy films but this just o.k. to me"
5,Nice,I like all Adam Sandler movies.. and this one was pretty good as well.. Its funny and worth watching ...
1,So stupid it was painful,"This movie was so incredibly stupid that I can't believe it was even made. Adam Sandler has gotten less and less funny over the years and more and more of a sellout than anything. Worse acting, worse performance he's ever done in his entire career was this movie. Even though we've reached an age now where even criticisms are being criticized, I honestly & truly dgaf. To sit and listen to how he talked throughout the entire movie was like sitting and listening to someone scratch a chalkboard for two hours. To applaud this movie you're more or less applauding statuary rape & incest & for that makes you a sm."
2,Disappointing,"Although it had a couple funny moments, I would say all in all, pretty lame. Glad I didn't buy it!"
2,Same old same old.,What can I say Adam Sandler using the same voice the same body movements the same ridiculousness that he always does. It's a great movie for the unintelligent masses of sheep who will laugh at anything.
1,Raunchy,"Disappointed in Mr. Sandler would let his comedy go to this level. Always enjoyed his movies that as they did show some class, not this one. Raunchy nasty and sick."
2,Strike Out for Adam Sandler,"I am a huge fan of Adam Sandler so when I saw this film I was shocked. At first I did not understand it than it started to make sense. I am glad that I have Amazon Prime and only paid 99 cents to view this film.My opinion, do not waste your money buying the DVD.Sorry Adam."
2,stupid,"Adam sandler is loosing it with this movie. Every time he was on camera, i wanted to punch him in the face with how idiotic he sounded in the movie. I love adam sandlers moves but this one is a flop."
1,content about children not funny at all,content about children not funny at allcontent about children not funny at allcontent about children not funny at all
3,Funny,I laughed a pretty good bit! I wouldnt say it was his best movie but compared to some of his last disappointments it was a lot better. I would recommend!
3,Crude humor,It was a typical shock comedy movie. I like Adam Sandler and have purchased most of his movies. Don't watch this with your children though.
3,Just average,"The movie was ok but nothing special.If you have a few extra hours with nothing else on it is worth watching, otherwise it can wait until you are bored."
3,It was alright,"Maybe I've just outgrown Adam Sandler's comedy. I'm not sure. But I thought this movie was just okay. It had some funny moments but overall, it just seemed like it was trying to hard to be raunchy. I'd still recommend it if you like his movies though."
2,first time I tried thompson: not so impressed.,"first time i tried this brand. seems like it may meet average user standards: I prefer Twin Labs though as I can feel the difference in my system after taking it. With the Thompsons brand, I did not notice much of an impact. fyi: I am taking this product for pain and nervous anxiety associated with long term recovery of a serious accident and so I may not be considered an ""average"" user."
3,not what you might expect,"When I heard the add for this book I expected it be a Christian version of ""What Color is your Parachute,"" helping me to decide what to do with my life. I ran right out and bought it without even checking the inside! I NEVER do this. I usually just check out books from the library! The title and the ad were misleading. I see this as a fine daily devotional, especially for serious business women like the author. I have been a stay-at-home mom for 17 years and could not relate that well to this author. I was also surprised that she never shared why she never married seeing that the topics she covered were so personal."
2,Not for guys or non-businessy people!,"When I saw this book, i thought it was a good book for me. but when i began to read it (after i bought it), i noticed something that i hadn't before: this was a woman's book. and not only a womens book, but a businesss womens book. i am not a woman, nor am i a business person, so i couldn't relate to the author AT ALL. So, I wouldn't recomend this book to boys, guys, or men; nor would i recomend it to women that can't relate to business-type stuff (which i can't). i feel bad that i wasted my money on a book written for the oppisite sex, but oh well... it was bargain price! My ratings is innaccurate for the appropiate adience of this book, though..."
3,Edgy,"Back Cover description: ""He's something of a catch you know"". Eloise was told about the handsome Dr. Timon van Zeilst. ""But no one's caught him yet."" Eloise felt quite sure that it wouldn't be her. Why should he look twice at a plain English nurse with the beautiful Liske around? And Liske had claimed she was destined to be his wife. It was no good telling herself not to care, because she did--even if he was the most infuriating man she'd ever met!This was somewhat typical of Ms. Neels plots; doctor, plain nurse, female villain and misunderstandings. In this story however, there seemed to me to be a little more tension/edginess to the story than I usually get with Ms. Neels books. I liked it, just can't put my finger on what was different."
5,Seven Stairs,a charming book! I gave it to two book dealer friends for Christmas and kept one.If you are into books and /or Chicago lore this is a perfect choice.
5,A book and author that will carry you away in greatness!,"This book will give you thrills, chills, and a new way of seeing horses and books. Misty of Chincoteague tells about 2 children learning the ways of life and death. With one blink of an eye you are in a non-stop excitement. Once you read one of Marguerite Henry's books you can't stop. Then you should read Stormy, Misty's Foal. Then Sea Star. And last, but not least Misty's Twillight. Each book is outstanding! Never for a moment you will be bored. Hopefully this helps."
5,Great Seller,Thanks for the prompt shipping. My kiddo will now be able to finish reading this summer project on time. Hope he remembers what he read after spending all that time at the water park.
5,"Misty of Chincoteague,a true classic.","My first pony came from Assateague Island off the coast from Chincoteague. The wonderful book by Marguerite Henry, Misty of Chincoteague is one of my favorites and I still treasure my hardback copy of this book that I received over 40 years ago. I wanted a hardback copy of this book as a gift for a young horse lover friend of mine and the one I ordered from Book Rescue was just perfect. I highly recommend this seller. Foncie Bullard, Point Clear, Al."
4,Nice box for fans,"First, for the reviewer earlier who couldn't get a disc to play, one is a DVD, not a cd, is this the problem?I'm a fan of interesting packaging of boxed sets and a fan of Magnolia Electric Co so this item was a double dip for me.The box its self is quite well made, somewhat along the line of the Great Goodbye Babylon set from Dust-to-Digital a few years back.The music is typical Magnolia fare, you either love it or leave it,maybe not as immediate as some of their other releases but a definite grower and keeper.My only real gripe is with the inner disc packing, it would be nice to have the tracklisting on the cd paper cover rather than have to hunt through the box to find the relevant card.Not much to complain about really."
4,Another top-compilation from Strictly Rhythm,"Among the profilic mega-house-indies since the early 90s, Strictly Rhythm always manages to produce massive club-tunes with no effort. Number 5 in the series of breath-taking house-compilations is literally the icing on the cake. Well, how could you go wrong with artists like Mone, Barbara Tucker and Roger S? Sometimes when you have a weak moment you might start to think something in the lines of ""Gee, this new Take That really gets me going!"".. Luckily there's a remedy called Strictly Rhythm to get those appalling ideas from your head. 100% N.Y. House-Music, killer!!"
1,This book has been censored!,"Under threat of a lawsuit from a Native American group, the publishers of this book physically cut the Epilogue from 10,000 copies, over the protests of the author of this chapter. This overt censorship is an act of politcal correctness which must not be tolerated."
5,We're pixies!,"This movie is the greatest fairly odd parents movie yet. The pixies try to take over fairy world again. This technically is a musical because of the songs. My favorite is ""The Pixie Rap.""Wanda and Cosmo's love song is one you might want to fast-forward through. Suprisingly, Cosmo can sing and Wanda is horrible. Overall, this is a great movie! BUY THIS MOVIE NOW!"
1,Not Rated does not mean Unrated,"One star; just because of the lost 6 minutes of the movie.Why don't the studios let us see the movie as the director has intended to show. After all this is a 40 years old art movie, not a porn flick.I will never buy a Koch Lorber film again."
2,"The ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" of Art-House Films","Unintentionally hilarious; so pretentious and poorly made that I was strangling with laughter several times. Jesus/God/Satan has sex with every member of a cartoonish bourgeois family and ruins their lives in various side-splitting ways. The maid becomes a saint who eats nettle soup, cures scarred children, and floats in the air. The wife bites the side of her finger, has sex with random strangers, and screams with all the authenticity of a teen in a slasher flick as Mozart's Requiem thunders in the background.The movie is technically inept and badly written. Any randomly chosen film of Bunuel or Almodovar will have more to say about sexual politics than this Pasolini fiasco. Recommended only for connoisseurs of the atrocious.Two stars for the ""So bad it's good"" factor."
2,"Good writing, but Ms. French tends to ""over-kill""","Although Ms. French had something worthwhile to share with the public, she overdid it. I started reading, page by page, but soon got bored with the ""over-kill"" at every turn of the page. I worked outside of the home for 15 years in various administrative positions, so I know that the things described in the book do happen: we women are definitely mistreated, underappreciated, underpaid, not shown the respect we deserve (even by fellow women), etc. But, please, enough is enough. I agree with the reader from Quebec that at times, the book read more like a male-bashing piece of fiction. And, definitely, Ms. French could have gotten what she wanted to say in less than 1/2 of the lengthy novel that was her end result. The quality of writing is there, even though more quantity than necessary was used."
5,Amazing Classic...,"every time I read it, I find new things, especially now that I'm old enough to be facing some of the choices of the women of the book instead of being the idealistic college freshman I was when I first read it.I still wish the ending had turned out differently, but it's still a pretty unerring portrait of our mothers and grandmothers and the world they came from."
1,AWFUL! AWFUL! AWFUL!,"This book is not only badly written (I just could not plough my way through the whole dreary thing) but also unbelievably irritating. Each and every character in it needs the biggest slap imaginable. All right, the men are awful - but the women are even worse. (And I'm a woman.) Why did stupid Mira take up with her stupid husband in the first place? This book would have you believe that any sort of valuable and precious relationship between the sexes cannot exist. Even in 1950 I refuse to believe that some men were not intelligent, interesting and compassionate. Stupid Mira should have had the sense to wait for one of them. Although she sure as hell didn't deserve one."
3,The bridge between Pablo Honey and The Bends.,"The ""My Iron Lung"" E.P. is a must-have. It features some great songs. Includes the classic ""The Trickster,"" which is a fave of many fans, yet was only played live once. Also ""Permanent Daylight"" and ""Punchdrunk Lovesick Singaglong,"" truly great music. The last track is an acoustic version of ""Creep"" snagged from the ""Creep"" import single. If you like Radiohead, this mini-album is definetely worth your cash."
4,A wonderful story,"This graphic novel tells a haunting, beautiful story. The look of the book, done entirely in black and white, is stylised and reminds me of the works of Tim Burton, such as *The Nightmare Before Christmas*. The writing and art are both elegant and deceptively simple. It is a science fiction story, with robots and futuristic settings. It has elements of Gothic fiction, with its dark towering castles and eccentric characters. It is also a fairy tale, using an exotic setting to tell a human story.Now, this book is not perfect. Finicky readers may quibble about plot points, and there are some spelling errors, which I myself only noticed on the tenth read. But so what? It still broke my heart, in the best possible way. If you are a fan of wonder tales, gothic horror, anime, or comic books that are just a little different from the norm, this book deserves a spot on your shelf."
4,First 5 songs are great...,"I knew this album when it first came out, so I have respect for it. I love the first five songs, but after that, I end up turning a deaf ear."
1,How to make your brain die,"The first half of the book discusses how 'exercising' your brain keeps it healthy. This section is mind numbingly boring. It glosses over the science so you will learn nothing new and merely repeats the concept that exercising your brain keeps it fit, over and over and over. The second half deals with the actual mental exercises or `neurobics'. There is nothing new or exciting and it is repetitive to the point where your brain is begging to be released from the mental torture. Let me break it down for you in a few of sentences so you can save yourself ten bucks. Use your less dominant hand to do things. Use your senses in ways they are not accustomed. For example, try to perform a task by feel that you normally do by sight. Finally, have new experiences. Here is an actual moronic example from the book: instead of a bagel and coffee in the morning, try a muffin and herbal tea. Your brain will be much healthier if you do anything other than read this book."
3,It works,"Purchased the sunshield for a Toyota Highlander, which it fits almost perfectly (still some gaps or overlapping if you are not careful to install correctly). Very large even when rolled-up tightly for storage. It does the job, which is to keep the car cool. My wife finds it annoying and doesnt use it, so it's not as useful as I would like."
1,"I thought this would fit our 15 inch baby doll, but it's way too wide.",This is going back to the seller. It's cheap and doesn't fit our baby. It comes in a box too - overpackaging is not something I appreciate paying for. It's not stylish. It was a mistake to buy it.
5,Smells Great!,I love this perfume. It is so versatile. You can use it for going shopping or working out. Caution: Don't put on to much thinking you can't smell it because it is really strong! Buy this!!!
5,Very Irresistible Indeed,I love the way I get so many compliments from this. Layer it with the very irresistible perfume and you have a scent that lasts all day! Worth every penny!
1,Looks like costume jewelery,"It looks better in the photo than in real life. The sterling silver looks more like plastic than anything else, and the quartz stone in the middle looks like a plastic bead. If you look at it from the back it looks like something out of a crackerjacks box, complete with what looks like superglue holding the stone in place. I bought it for a gift, I ended up buying another item elsewhere since I was too embarrassed to give it to her.Bottom line: Good for a Halloween costume for your 9 year old, too tacky for an adult."
5,SO Celebrity...Yet So down to earth,I've always been a fan of Jessica simpson and everyone ive ever met has a different opinion of her.Personally i think shes hilerious.Yes shes naive and has no real clue about the ins and outs of the simple side of the universe but thats not the point.Its great to see a celebrity not living up their own ass for a change and i would recommend this dvd to anyone.Not only is it entertaining but nick and jess make the sweetest couple.
3,"Re: i still ""live"" newlyweds anyway...","According to the Newlyweds page on MTV.com, there are 3 seasons of Newlyweds, not 4.Link to episode guide:http://www.mtv.com/onair/dyn/newlyweds-nick_and_jessica/episode.jhtml?episodeID=80865"
1,where's my review?,I reviewed this film a couple weeks ago and I am wondering why it hasn't been posted. Please post my review I feel it is important for people to know more than one persons opinion.
4,Declarer play clearly explained,"This book explains gradually more sophisticated principles of declarer play in a clear, concise manner. I'm a recreational player trying to succeed in local ACBL club play, and this book teaches a progression of skills to understand and incorporate into my play. For me, the detail, number of examples, and chapter quizzes are about right. Understanding the principles and actually applying them in competitive play are two very different things, but this book clearly shows me the path I need to follow to raise my game."
5,a Great Treasure,"This is the first VH1 Storytellers DVD that I have purchased and I have to admit that I am with truth greatly pleased. The setting, the directing, the music and Alanis herself all give off this vibe that relaxes you and alleviates you of your stress. Alanis' beautiful and captivating voice makes me smile as well as cry. I found it to be a great treasure to watch her engage in conversations with the audience. It's really interesting to hear what she has to say, even though her songs speak for herself. Alanis with truth knows how to pull in an audience and she knows how to offer a great performance. I cannot wait to see her live someday in my life.Set List:Hand In My PocketYou LearnThank UUnsentYou Oughta KnowThat I Would Be GoodStillUninvitedHead Over Feet"
5,Gullo is to diet what Gunnar Peterson is to Fitness,"If your ready for real permenant change, this book is for you. Not only will Gullo give you the tools to lose weight, forever, he'll help you to face your food history. This book isn't for those that want to lose a quick ten pounds, this book is for women/men that want real permenant change. As a lifestyle and beauty reporter, this is the only book I have ever given 5 stars in the diet category."
3,Enjoyable and lively,"I'm not usually a big fan of teen books, but I had to read a few contemporary realistic fiction books for young adults for a graduate-level University class recently and picked this one. The dialogue was quirky and fun. The plot was true and the plot unfolded in an interesting way. I especially felt the details about the kiss was funny and great!"
5,The BEST long underwear for kids who don't like a tight fit!!!,I love this brand of long underwear. The relaxed fit is PERFECT for my kids who hate a tight fit. the fabric is very soft and comfortable to wear under clothes. They have been worn to outdoor soccer games (under uniform) and skiing. LOVE THESE!
2,Disappointing - I felt cheated with the ending,"My father told me that most of the old Sam Spade-type of books were of the same ilk as this one. They're certainly not bad, but they leave something to be desired. ""Death"" seems to be written with great care and attention as the murder happens and the mystery begins, but then it just ends. It seems to me that the author was given a page limit and once he reached it, he simply ""solved"" the crime. The criminal isn't necessarily someone we've ever met before, it isn't someone integral to the plot, it doesn't make sense - it just is.Zubro made me feel cheated. I was teased with an engaging read, only to be left unfulfilled by the outcome. When you read a mystery there should at least be enough clues for the reader to make some viable guesses at who the murderer is: that just isn't the case here."
5,I never imagined marriage could be so wonderful,"This was the first marriage book I was able to read without becoming angry about all the things my husband WASN'T doing. Instead, for the first time ever, I suddenly saw the things I WAS doing to push my husband away from me, to crush his spirit. God truly used this book to show me His amazing and perfect plan and order for marriage, and my life hasn't been the same since. And when I changed, made the decision to honor my husband, he became everything I had hoped for without even trying or realizing. We are best friends now, not antagonists to one another. I never dreamed marriage could be as wonderful as mine is right now."
4,fun but really strange,"This is one really strange film. The people who made tried to make humans into cartoon characters through the application of pounds of makeup. Everyone has the look of a postnuclear mutant tribe. The dialog was really hard to follow because of the way they talk (I can't even describe it). Its almost like a warhol film from the 1960s. Everything about it just seems strange and off. But for whatever reasons, its compelling to watch. One virtue is that its not boring like other adaptations of Lil Abner (the musical in particular) and there is always something stranger to see every few minutes.I think the film as a film probably works better with people who understand the source material really well. If you don't know it, its really difficult to follow whats going on.But regardless, this film will be an interesting experience for almost anyone. I dont think its ever shown up on DVD unfortunately and the VHS print isn't all that great."
3,Strictly for beginners,"While Chris Carmichael and Lance Armstrong are without any doubt two of the most interesting people in the cycling business to ask for advice on training issues, this book is a terrible letdown for any advanced cyclist. While it provides loads of usefull information for someone who is just about to start with cycling, any longtime cyclist will be very disappointed. More than half of the book delivers information of the ""I've known this for years"" kind, while the other half gives extremely compressed information for advanced cyclists that is in no way sufficient for the serious cyclist. I highly recommend this book for beginners who need some basic information on cycling and who want to play around with the concepts involved in serious training without actually training seriously. For all others there probably still exists no alternative to Joe Friel's Training Bible (which on the other hand is a book, no novice shoul lay his hands on)."
1,Fluff Piece,"What a disappointing waste. This is not a training manual. It is a fluff piece about Lance. I love both Armstrong and Carmichael but this book is not worthy of them. If you want to learn about Lance read ""It's not about the bike"". If you want a training manual look at some of the other Bicycling Magazine books. And feel free to send me a dollar for saving you this money."
2,Not a good slasher.,"I didn't really like this movie at all, it's a slasher with very lame kill scenes, a lame story , horrible acting. The only thing that improves the movie was the last couple of minutes with the twist on the identity of the killer or killers but other than that stay away. No scene selections and no special features. There's another thing i would love to note is that the dvd cover makes no sense at all why is there a SCREAM ghostface mask on the cover, the killer never wore that mask, but don't be tricked its nothing like SCREAM movies."
1,Pathetic Anime,"This is one of the worst animes out there that is available for purchase. The purpose of this anime appears to be to attract male viewers with poorly drawn-ugly girls who spend a lot of time in the nude. There is no story, the dialogue is crappy, the acting is bad, and the so called humor is lacking. ..."
4,They are nice enough for the price,"The stones are on the dull side while the setting is very bright and shiny. Also, the stems are VERY long and really pierce your neck if you have to cradle a phone. But, for the price, they were a good deal."
1,Had to choke it down...,"I don't mean to offend the author, for I haven't read any of her other writtings as of yet, but this book spoke highly of one that was thrown together on a one week deadline.The writing was poor, the plot rambling to a climax that never happened, and an ending that left me wondering what the point was, I feel this book is one of the worst I have ever read.I've very little doubt that the author was forced to conform to the standards of the Shattered Light Game, which in itself was a dull, confusing, lifeless piece of work with a small following.To the likes of Jordan, Brooks, Goodkind, and Feist, I easily say that this book is it's complete opposite."
2,This book was really boring....,"Let me start by telling you a brief summary of this book. Billy Caldwell is a 16 Year old boy who travels with an Indian Chief name Tecumseh. Billy ventures out with Tecumseh and fights the Americans. Now, I'm not a big war fan. This book is really slow. It took me 1 month to read. This book starts too get a little better toward page 185 out 227. That's 185 pages of boring. I like books like Harry Potter that aren't so real. This book is like Indian Captive. Be warned. You might like it, you may not. The names are very hard to pronounce."
3,I sit on my tractor and cry.,"This isn't one of their better albums. But ""Daddy Was a Preacher but Mama was a Go-Go Girl"" is great."
3,impressive but.....,"I'm a Lauryn Hill fan and I purchased this DVD cus of the positive reviews posted this site. She's really good, no doubt about that. Her voice was cracking a lot of times though. You could really feel what she's saying. Not bad with the guitar also. When the track starts, you'll get into it, after a while you'll loose focus cus there's too much adlib. I'm sure the audience felt the same way. Some were already out of it. She's really good but there's too much adlib. She also talks too much in between tracks. An hour and 45 minutes with only 13 songs..... go figure"
3,"Good price, but","Plus:- Good deal on the price and love the convenience of free delivery.- Subscribe and Save saves money.- Son ate it.- Not always in stock at stores so online good buy.- Like the 8 ounce size containers.Minuses:- Son gets constipated with the Rice cereal, the Oatmeal is much better.- Uses to much breast milk when mixing together.- If you mix by directions won't be the right consistency to feed baby.I would buy one package first and see how your child reacts to the Rice before you buy the pack of 6 like I did."
5,My baby loves this!,"I have been giving this rice cereal to my now 10 month old daughter since she was 6 months old! She loves it! She loves it plain. I did buy Happy Belly brown rice cereal but she doesn't like it. Also Gerber mixes really smooth, Happy Belly is very lumpy when mixed. I will be buying this again!"
4,Could be better,"I bought several case of it, thinking my little baby girl will like it. Nope, she does not like it mixed with water or milk. It does not mix well with soup. Since it has a mild sweet taste to it, it will ruin the flavor of the soup. She is picky, what can I say.Finally, after many tries, we finally figured out a way to feed her the cereal: mix the cereal with formula/milk; pour into a pan and warm it up on the stove; while heating it up, stir constantly to ensure they are mixed together; once well mixed, let it cool and then pour into bottle to feed. I had to cut the silicone nipple in order to accommodate the thick liquid.We feed her this mix once or twice daily. As she grows, formula/milk alone do not last as long as they used to. To keep her stomach content, night time feeding is essential, so she does not awake from hunger in the middle of the night. A bit of work, but I think it is worth it."
1,I prefer box cereal,I switched from the box cereal to this particular kind thinking it was better and it made my son have diarrhea!!!! I'm switching back to the box cereal.
1,6 month old vomits after eating this,"My sweet 6 month old might have food allergies - he's thrown this up about three times now (last time I'll try with this.) He's been exclusively breastfed until now, and I've introduced sweet potato, pears, applesauce, squash, carrots and mixed veggies with no drama. I've noticed that this ceral not only contains rice, but soy, tuna, and pork-based gelatin. Going to a pediatric allergist tomorrow to check out what's going on. Poor baby! Would love to hear if anyone else has a similar story."
2,anthology of post nash era,"i picked this up after getting the 'epic anthology' disc. while i don't think this is cover to cover good like that compilation is, it does have it's merits. the first song sounds a lot like a rewrite of long cool woman but it's still a pretty cool song. transatlantic westbound train is another great track. the low point in this collection is anything done after about 1979, without nash's replacement terry sylvester, who was a great foil to the hicks,clark,elliot triumvirate. and even the track from the eighties have those great hollies-style harmonies that can make the synthesizer drenched crap sound decent. i would like to point out that vol 1 & 2 are far superior to the volume three installment of hollies at abbey road. you can probably just download the good tracks on this somewhere else versus investing in this collection."
3,missing parts,"got the back pack did not get the water bottle as in the ad. would have liked to use the water bottle seeing how i paid for it. like buying a car without the tires, yea it looks good sitting on the rims but would like to take it for a spin. oh well live and learn"
4,this was fun,I got this because Lou Diamond was in it.I had no idea what it was going to be like. I was tired of getting movies that were not any good so I was looking for stars that I enjoy.I was so surprised. LDP plays a bad guy and does it so well.This is one that turned out to be fun and I am so glad I bought it.I always like Robert Forster and He was great also.
3,Shoot out the Lights: a so so cd that I bought out of curio,"I am not a huge Richard Thompson fan. I really like his acoustic work and so I picked up this cd. If you are a real fan of his bitter lyrics and pounding beat you will like this. If you prefer his lyrical songs such as ""1952 Vincent"" you will be pretty disapointed"
3,"Please,no more sponges!","If you can make it through the first half, you will enjoy the second. It was like the book had two authors. I feel I know more than I ever wanted to know about ""sponges"". Enough, Already with the sponges. The diving history was very enjoyable, but I could have done without his personal experences."
5,Wets Your Appetite,"My girlfriend gave me two Christmas presents - both designed to wet my interest in diving. Admittedly, I was initially much more taken by the other present - a fish tank screen saver. However, in no time flat, the little fish ceased to dart around my screen and I turned my attention to this book. SO GLAD I DID! Ecott's descriptions of his underwater adventures kept me turning the pages and, better still, propelled me into the nearest dive center. What a revelation. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who likes water ... or even just a shower. (And don't buy those screen savers)"
4,Sobering epic movie,This was a very good movie. I had seen it before and second time around it was even better.
3,finding the life of love.....,"most of the world of asian life is totally love of the family. in this movie "" to live"" tells it all, no matter how tuff the life falls upon you. the more love you carry the stronger you are. the intenational film makers, are showing the world."
4,Like Clift's Notes in Shakespeare class,"For an electrophysiologist in training this is like ""Clift's Notes"" in Shakespeare class; everyone has it, everyone has read it, but nobody admits to it!For any cardiology fellow interested in EP fellowship, or who wants to get the most out of an EP rotation, buy this book and read it over the weekend. THEN buy Zipes or Josephson and quote from one of them.I recommend this as a starting point for those interested in EP fellowship, or as a good overview for those who are affiliated with EP and want a better understanding.I only give it 4 of 5 stars, because the author occasionally gets opinionated, but at least his humor is refreshing."
2,Only volume 3,"Please be awared that this is only volume 3. It wasn't very clear in the product description when I purchased it, and then I had to return it."
2,A Barely Mediocre OVA series,"Ok..I know that I'm not exactly a fan of the Sega game, but I need to warn others who are not fans of it. I don't want to be REALLY mean to the existing fans of Sakura Wars, but this OVA is extremely unfulfilling. The characters have no true development, the story goes nowhere, and the animation is ok. There aren't even any good fight scenes in it! I watched the first tape of the OVA and thought to myself, ""Wow, this is going to be good!"" Then I saw the second tape and could only feel disappointment. (Sigh) There was so much potential in the OVA, but it never came out. I don't think it's worth your money to actually pay for this OVA unless you're already a fan of the game. If you're still interested, I suggest that you rent it first!"
3,Finally,Glad to see the character that almost made us give up on this otherwise enjoyable series is gone.We're looking forward to purchasing any upcoming Sumire-free disks.
2,Boring!,"I've not seen the TV series at all. I saw the preview of this DVD on Last Exile (which is a pretty cool series) I was attracted by the excellent detailed animation in the 2 minute preview. I couldn't find a review on it so I went and bought it. Unfortunately all this movie has going for it is the animation. Which personally I think is superb! The story is sorely lacking and the translation must be way off, Heck I don't speak a word of japanese but I can even tell I was missing more to the story. There is no explanation to any of the characters nor why they are there except there deamons attacking Japan. No explanation on the demons at all. Plus the movie seems skip alot from scene to scene without explaing any of the event. To top it off you have an ending that makes no sense. You don't even know what exactly is happening. I advise just to rent it and if you do put it on mute and just look at the eye candy."
2,Another case of Style over Substance,"Short review: Sakura Wars has some of the most beautiful animation that I've seen in an anime series. I was really struck by the use of color and detail in this anime. Unfortunately, that's where my enjoyment of this anime ended. I found the story to be very tired, and the characters about as interesting as drying paint. Too fluffy for my taste.If you like ""You're Under Arrest"" then this might be along your line of anime (...but maybe not). If you like Eva, Lain, and Bebop; then you probably wouldn't get much our of Sakura Wars. I recommend renting it before committing your hard earned cash."
4,"great stories, overly gory","Love the interesting stories and the characters; plots, pacing, and suspense are all great; but the series is overly gory, ER is mild in comparison. That's one reason I like the dvds so well, I can fastforward right through the gory parts, plus miss the commercials; or rather, I don't miss them. Like the fact that the film stars in this series don't consider it beneath them to do a tv series. The mix of personality is good in this, would probably like a little more love interest stories added to this, but that's from a gal's perspective."
5,CSI the first season,"Like i sad in when you see it on tv you willnot get anove of it so i watch the first,secondand thirt season and i am about to get started onthe fourth season"
1,Would have 5 stars if it were in it's original 16x9 aspect,First I'd like to say that I am really impressed with this show. I would have given it 5 stars except for on thing......the show's aspect is 16x9 widescreen and the DVD is fullscreen.I'm guessing that the boxset is fullscreen for one reason....Warners Bros went the lazy route on this because the DVD set was actually produced over a year ago and they don't feel like re-mixing it. FYI - This boxset was released in the UK last year. I hate the fact that companies like Warner Bros don't condsider what the fans want. Considering how popular the show is you would think that they would have made both a fullscreen AND widescreen version. I give FOX kudos for releasing 24 widescreen. Why can't Warner Bros do the same?I'm also betting that Warner Bros will release the show widescreen when HD-DVD's become popular in a few of years from now. At least it will be widescreen AND in high definition then.
4,C.S.I. Crime Scene Investigation - The Complete First Season,"Waqs a present for a friend, they thoroughly enjoyed watching this"
5,Inspiring,"Inspiring and lovely. Several beautiful selections to listen toover and over. Good price, and fast shipping."
2,A plagarism,"The author of this book has ""Karen"" give the SAME EXACT PHILOSOPHY that you would find in ""Our Unseen Guest"", written over 50 years before this book was published!"
1,Not worth it,"Japanese soft core. Full of pixilations to cover up ""the good stuff"", and kept crashing in my DVD player."
3,"OK, but there's been better","The premise is old and has been done better before - ""Watchmen"" comes immediately to mind. Compared to the thoughtfulness and attention to detail in that milestone work, the ""Powers"" universe feels very hastily thrown together. Cheap tricks, like a barely explained ""light"" that nullifies super powers, provide easy plot devices and eventually weakens the already predictable conclusion to the book's title question. The main characters are vaguely interesting, but are fairly one dimensional - We've all seen the hard-edged detective with a secret and his unwanted, but scrappy (female) sidekick as well as the stereotypical Mark David Chapman type ""crazed fan"" killer they hunt. On the plus side, the art is great and the book itself is printed on high quality paper with loads of extras - including the full script of the first issue."
2,Not what I expected,"I got this for my son when he was 12 months old thinking he would like it. I was wrong, it is for babies who can't walk yet. My son lked the music it played and the lights but that was all. Total waste of money."
2,Not as fun as expected,It doesn't even play the whole take me out to the ball game song!!! It is not very heavy so it gets knock down very easily. My 1yo doesn't care for it. We will see if he plays with it more as he gets older. I usually like Playskool stuff.
3,He can kick it!!!,"Great toy if only it were taller. He loves the lights and sounds, but he is much too tall for it. I am wondering at what age he should have gotten it because it's so small that he can kick it now and he's just now learning to swing a bat. The pictures are a little deceiving."
4,Great for any little slugger.,"Right now, my 8th month old is just able to push the ball, hit the plate that makes it light up & makes noises and suck on the bat! He loves it and smiles alot. I love that you can raise it up, for taller toddlers. I can't wait til he can stand and practice hitting the ball to get ready for the big leagues! I wish the bottom was a little heavier, but it doesn't have a problem with tipping over. Overall I suggest this toy. I think it will make my little man have great hand eye coordination skills!!"
3,Annoying toy,"My son does seem to like this toy, but as the other reviewers said he recieved it as a gift at 1 year old and he was already to tall for it. It is very annoying b/c it says only like 3 or 4 phrases over and over! And it is random so if you hit it hard it may not be a homerun, it will throw out random phrases like ""you hit a double"". It is a decent toy I guess b/c my son likes it alright, but watch out as a parent it really gets on my nerves! :)"
5,Works Great!,"We have used this tray for the second year in a row to keep food warm at our Christmas barn party and it has worked wonderfully. They're fine to leave plugged in, but once unplugged they keep food warm for about an hour. I am going to buy a couple more for next year because they work so well. I will definitely buy the 4 plate, because as others have said it only comfortably fits two of the larger dishes."
4,A fine piece!,I love this pendant! It is a very nice size and very gorgeous. I haven't worn it yet though because now I have to purchase a chain.
5,God must have spent a little more time on Justin!,"The cd was really good! I loved it. My favorite songs are Kiss Me at Midnight and Merry Christmas, happy Holidays. So if your thinking of buying the cd, DO! Oh and Justin is FINE!!!!!!"
2,its ok,this losses signal at any point you put it in it doesnt screw into both vga cables and its not yellow
4,Laughed throughout the book,The book had some really funny moments and was delightful. So far I've liked all of her books.
5,I loved this book!!,"I laughed so much during this book! It was great a must read.Lord Bannor the Bold is the pride of England and the fear of the French. So what could someone of this reputation fear? Why his dozen unruly children of course. Not knowing what to do with them or how to handle them he sends his steward out to find him a mother for his children. But there is a condition to this bride search. The lady in question must be maternal in nature, unattractive and too plain to tempt him in matters of the flesh. His steward brings Willow who is not maternal in nature in fact does not like children over much since she had to raise and take care of her step sister and brother and who is far form unattractive. As a way to pay her new husband back Willow joins forces with his impish children to teach him a lesson that he will never forget. That is the lesson of love.Don't miss this one if you love to laugh while faling in love."
3,not that good.,"I don't think that this book deserves almost 5 stars. The story was pretty predictable and while the characters are cute, they weren't memorable. This is the my first Medeiros book and I hope her other books are better because I'm not impressed."
2,Super silly!!!,"I just could not finish it, it was absurd, woring and i read like 65% of the book untill I finally gave up that it was not going to get betterI am a romantic fan and this was not romantic at all. It was not realistic and it was silly, silly. I just do know understand all the good reviews it got, perhaps I was not in the mood or reading that days."
5,"Hilarious, tender, and touching!","I've loved all of Ms. Medeiros's books, but this one truly shines. It's funny and tender at the same time. It made me laugh and cry and taught me some poignant lessons about life and love. If you've been waiting for that special read to come along, wait no more! This book is destined to become an instant classic."
4,Simply Charming!,"A lovely and quick read. I admire Medeiros's humor and romantic tales. She didn't disappoint me with this novel. It's definitely a Cinderella story. Acutally, it reminded more of blend of Drew Barrymore's ""Ever After"" with the wily kids from ""The Sound of Music.""This book made me laugh and the romance was sweet and witty."
4,Very insightful about causes of eye problems,I particularly liked the information about specific eye problems and how they are related emotionally. The exercises are excellent and each eye problem has exercises specifically for that problem
1,Not working anymore,"Used it for a couple weeks, now it does not ignite anymore.Amazon tells us to ship it to the manufacturing facility, but where the heck can you find it?Not happy... Don 't know what to do, I do think that 35 bucks is not cheap for a lighter that looks good bit does not work..."
2,Stormproof Lighter,I loved the lighter when I received it. It worked great. Then it suddenly stopped working. I had the lighter three days and used it only once before it stopped working. I did return it and Amazon did give me a credit on my card.
4,"tank is a bit small, altitude not a problem","This is a great butane lighter, after trying both zippo blu and a zippo third party butane insert this is the first one that lights every time at first try...Although the flame shape is a little unorthodox it lights things well and has a good temperature.The manufacturers of the other 2 lighters i tried excused their missgivings on the altitude where i live, but this lighter has no trouble with it, ive even been hiking higher than where i live and it still lit first try inmidiately.The only thing i would have to complain about this lighter is the tank size, i would estimate the full tank can power the thing at minimum flame for 7 minutes of contiguous burn... not great when the zippo blu (after lighting on the 9th try) could burn it's tank in 25 minutes ""just an estimate though""Great buy all around."
1,Major fail,"I loved it at first. Showed it off to other people, many of whom bought one. Recently the 'rubber' cover has started to break apart. It had not had hard use, in fact, little use. It does not get exposed to temp extremes nor physical abuse. Coating just started breaking off. Very dis-satisfied."
2,cheaply made piece of junk,"fell apart on me three days after i bought it. made of cheap plastic, comes empty, very difficult to get it to fill, will not fill all the way or even close (i got it to about half full and it would not fill anymore), does not always light on first try, annoying to open, bulky for the size of the actual lighter. save yourself some money and go with a nicer lighter."
1,not very assurring,"Received the lighter, filled with premium butane - it lit once and then refused to light. I drained it and tried again. Still no luck. I sent it back to the manufacturer for service/replacment. We'll see. I'm not fond of emregency gear that doesn't work."
5,wind and water proof lighter,It works great! If you like boating or going to the beach you need this lighter it works under any weather condition.
1,"Actually, no warranty","I have had 3 of these. They work great for about 2 years and then fall apart.They will repair the lighter if there is proof of a ""manufacturer defect"" and proof of purchase. But, you must send it to them and include a check for $20 for the repair. Bummer."
1,This ligher is an absolute POJ,Right out of the box I could not get it to work. I tried every configuration and adjustment. At it best it puffs and goes out like the candle on a birthday cake. Poof. It does make a good paper weight.
4,Great but difficult,"Quickbooks for Nonprofit does a lot of great things. Just what we needed. However, it was extremely difficult to get started with. We can understand why QuickBooks markets their software support as another profit center - they know you will be calling them for help!"
1,"No, there is NOT ""one true way"", as Russo claims.","Do not waste your time on this book. Russo ""explains"" other religions but with a heavily-biased Christian viewpoint, which is completely unfair. If Christianity was the only ""Way"", as Russo claims, then why would other religions exist? Consider this question, and do not buy this book."
4,Brutally honest,"Recomended for all seekers of the truth, U G here explains with brutal honesty what it is to be awakened. You won't find white lights and bliss in this book but you will find out what it is really like and may want to rethink your intentions. For serious seekers only!"
3,It's ok,"It's ok. It's good to see it, but it doesn't go any deep. It's just some demonstrations on what you can do to your lover."
2,Disappointing Thompson,"Any recent convert to Richard Thompson's music will find this album disappointing. It's not bad, but he finds no real groove, and the somewhat clumsy tunes range from pretty good to lifeless. Probably his worst post-Linda album."
2,"Buen diseño, muy mal funcionamiento.","Es un reloj con un diseño exelente, pero consume mucha batería y a cada rato se resetea y pierde la hora. No lo recomiendo."
3,Very Helpful,"This book is very helpful for a quide in identifiying shorebirds but still can't figure out what the shorebird with a dark head, light underneath, and a straight bill is."
5,Great for first grade,"This might not be a thesaurus for older primary students; but, it is a wonderful resource for first graders. Very easy to use and great presentation for children who are new to using a thesaurus. I use this thesaurus in my classroom and my students love it!"
2,It sucks,"It broke in 2 weeks, but it was pretty cheap, i guess it lasted longer then i payed for it."
1,this product seemed like it was done in a home garage.. it's not as advertised. if you were this product people will think that,this product seemed like it was done in a home garage.. it's not as advertised. if you were this product people will think that you made this in your own home.
3,A little thin,They are good. Nice soft liner. The saw as most in stores. But they could use a little more padding def wouldn't think of throwing them in the back of my truck.
5,Good product at great price,"I bought this to store my helmet instead of keeping it in the box it came in.When it arrived it was bigger than I though but this turned out to be an advantage as I can store not only my helmet, but both my summer and winter gloves, glove liners and next protector, and it looks good enough that my wife doesn't mind it sitting in the dining room."
4,Great sewing book,This is a very good book for some one who is just learning this skill. Also lots of more advance techniques.Only problem is it could have better illustrations.
5,Just ordered,Just ordered yesterday does anyone know if the fit over glasses glasses am going to use them for airsoft. I'm sure they will be great
4,Pretty Good!,"I wasn't expecting much from this DVD, but it was surprisingly pretty good! I did the routine last night and my buns are hurting today! It's not a killer workout, but it seems effective. I like the fact that they mix a bit of aerobics (warm out), kickboxing, toning with weights (mainly squats), and yoga stretches. I think they cold have done the yoga part a bit more challenging.... overall it's an ok DVD for lighter days. I see myself doing this one when I feel kind of lazy!"
4,Good workout,"This DVD was pretty good. I bought it after I'd gotten the ""Slim & Sleek Fast,"" with Ellen Barrett as the trainer. The lady on this one is Austrailian I think, so there was a bit of difficulty at first understanding her. Overall, the routine is effective, but the trainer isn't as good as Ellen."
3,Didn't make it any smaller,"I gave this one a few trys since I really wanted to like it. These Self DVDs always seem to hook me with their covers. This one did not really feel that it was going to bring about the changes I am looking for. I have some of their other workouts and honestly I don't really feel they do that much either. But then, I am already pretty fit so maybe for someone just starting out they would be okay."
2,Fan,The fan guard cover is almost impossible to install. It is the worst design I ever used. The air flow is not spectacular.
3,"3 Stars from Mom, 5 Stars from the Reader","It must be the generation gap setting in - I don't much like this series, but my 8 year old has just about eaten up the series. I like books with more of a plot, and a little bit deeper - but everyone needs a good 'escape' read every so often.On the bright side, these are a short read for kids. There is no violence, although it seems pretty clear that their teacher is a vampire since she comes from Transylvania and talks with an accent.The other up side is that if we read these together (which we like to do), we can each try out the Transylvanian accent.If you need books to read by yourself (for those under 10), I'd say go for these. Parents can rest assured that these books are a nice adventure for the kids."
2,Don't get excited about this one.,"This is an average commentary. The style is easy to read. However, if you are looking for a scholarly or deeply exegetical volume, don't look here."
2,"Nothing very special, just a junky mystery novel...","I read this book and _Abra Cadaver_ (also by Tucker) while on vacation and snowed in for a couple weeks.I was initially quite interested in the book, as the first few chapters happened quickly and the protagonist (Merlin, again) is a likeable guy.The rest of the book, however, is just not too well written, and not too believeable. The plot devices are unimaginable, the dialog is choppy, and often times the author forgets to inform the reader of crucial details.After all, a murder novel isnt a mystery if the author has not posed the ""whodunnit"" question with any talent; it's merely an obfuscated tale of events.Skip this book, or pick it up second-hand and read it on a long plane flight. Its not particularly entertaining."
5,Great Movie!!!!,I've watched this movie years ago and it still has the same effect on me now.It's chilling to watch what happened to this young man.I won't spoil it...but it will keep you watching...waiting to see what happens next andwhat this family has to struggle through even after the conclusion.No family should have to go through what this family did.
1,Pitiful & disappointing,"The subject matter and amateur film footage leant itself to a fun documentary, but the ""host"" & ""hostess'"" were unfunny & annoying.The same raw material could have been turned into something decent, even with the same host but not his ridiculous companion), by a competent documentarian."
2,disappointing,"Two people give us a tour of the locations where the soprano's were filmed. Pizza parlors, the Bada Bing club, the restaurants, the pork meats store. Current owners are introduced. Some footage of poor quality videos made by fans that filmed some of the shoots have been made available for this production. But the overall quality of the content, and post-production, is quite low. It could have been made into a much better production."
1,Dizzy ditz tours various locations,"When I put on a video I almost always watch the whole thing, even if it takes me a few sittings. But for this one, I stayed with it less than an hour and gave up. It is pretty awful.The title Sopranos Unauthorized made me think that there would be some interesting and revealing things about the show. There aren't any of those. It is mostly just looking at locations, like Pizzaland, or the Sopranos home in North Caldwell, or Satriale's pork store. It's like taking one of those boring tours of stars homes. I've never done that and never will.What's worse, there's a lot of what passes for comedy but is really unfunny. Someone plays the dizzy ditz, and she isn't the least bit funny or entertaining. She just plays a caricature, and it isn't worth watching.This is one of the worst videos you can get on Amazon."
1,Is this a novel or an investment book???,"Very dissapointing. I don't know if this book is a novel or an investment book...It's just like reading a story book... It's a joke....I almost got nothing from this book...Nothing about the covered call detailed in this book.A good investment book on covered call should consist minimum: How to choose a good stock, how to choose a good strike price, how to pick an expiration date, and most importantly how to manage your position if the market goes against you. You will not get these topics in this book..."
3,Good quick rampup to learning about Covered Calls,The author does a good job of conveying the material is a simplistic manner. Knowledge and experiance with buying and selling stock is definitely a prerequisite. I learned many useful tools in determining the right stock to sell calls on while meeting my risk level.I recommend this book to those who are just getting start with covered call writing.
2,Read this book only if you have no idea what Covered call is,"This is a book that tell me nothing new about covered calls.It only explained what is covered call, never provided any good strategy or method.If you are know nothing about covered calls, then read this book, otherwise don't."
5,Buy this BBV,"John C. Reilly is an amazing actor. If you didn't know he was an actor, you would swear Steve Brule was a real person. He is so believable! What a comedic genius! The only parts I don't like are the weird Jani stuff. I love the space episode haha."
5,Check It Out You Dingus!,"Is there Life on Earth? How do you make a friend? Should we be afraid of pruppets? These and many other fascinating questions are explored in great detail by Doctor Steven Brule on this BBV. But don't be a hunk you dummy, just wait for the VHS or Bru-ley release for Denny's sake! Told ya! For your Horse!"
2,Frankenlamp,"I would have given 4 stars if the first one had not been missing a shade. I would have given 3 stars if the second one had not shown scratching around the base. I ordered the first one to arrive just before I needed it, so used Prime Free Two Day Shipping. When I found it was defective, time was short and I added another $3.99 to get the second quicker. After combining the usable parts, I have a working lamp but still have to repack the other and take it to the post office. I guess it comes down to, are you feeling lucky? After saying all that, it is a very attractive and functional reading light for two, placed on a table between the sofa and chair. I used two 27 Watt (actual, not equivalent) CFL, and my wife thinks it's almost too bright. (I don't know why anyone would expect a lamp of this configuration to light up a whole room.)"
2,"One of their lamer features, but Julian Wells is hot","Obvious spoof of the gameshow that kind of came and went as a pop culture icon. If you're used to Seduction Cinema product's, you may be disappointed, as the concept and production here are pretty pedestrian; a cheesy tv set and not the usual vain attempts at storytelling you get from them. A couple of the girls are hot (especially Julian), the girl/girl stuff occasionally rises above Skin-a-max level (not enough pink, unfortunately), and I find Julian Wells to be one of their best attresses. She is not a silicone sex bomb, but she's attractive, blonde, seems bright and is game in attempting to pull off their lame attempts at comedy. Spider-Babe is a better Wells flick, and you get to see her with Misty Mundae, who's always a 10 on the peter-meter!"
4,Thompson's Greatest Hits?,"The most cost-effective introduction to the cult of Richard Thompson, SMALL TOWN ROMANCE draws on all areas of his career, up to the time of it's release. You get the great hooks ( ""How Many Times"", "" I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight""), the great heartbreak songs (""For Shame of Doing Wrong"", ""Small Town Romance""), and a rare live version of the non-sentimental sentimental song ""Meet On the Ledge"". The warts-and-all approach ( a few missed notes and audible throat clearing) don't diminish the music in any way - any fan of folk, great guitar playing, and first-rank songwriting will lap this up like a thirsty pup. Although ""Watching the Dark"" is a more comprhensive overview of his career, SMALL TOWN ROMANCE is a wonderful alternative to plump for."
2,disappointing,"Got this book from Grandma for my 8 year old. She is a great cook; everything she's made from other books has been delicious. While this book has beautiful images and very reasonable portions, for some reason everything we've made from it was a disappointment. Cookies had an off taste, frosting was drippy, etc. Last night, we decided to give it one more try. My daughter tried to make cream puffs and they came out like little crepes- dough was too runny. I know that it may have been cook's error, but when I handed her ""The Joy of Cooking"" and she looked up the cream puff recipe there and made flawless puffs (with NO help from mom), you've got to wonder about her track record with this book. We finally decided to throw this book away. Too bad."
4,Nice Gentle Yoga,Very gentle easy yoga. I was looking for something for my mother who is 75. This will help her maintain and increase her flexibility. Poses start with wake up in bed and move to standing and chair. It's perfect for her. It's easy to follow and has a variety of stretches. It's a good beginning level especially for first timers.
2,Misses TOO Much,I got this hoping it would help with the puzzles. Now there must be at least 2 versions of the Silent Hill game. As this book only has 199 items listed as the total. and there are actually 204 + Hidden Items.This guide helped through some basics but had bad info too. Like the turnstile puzzle it was wrong. It was NO HELP with the piano.And did not have full item & weapon lists. Like it did not even mention the Hammer which is like the most wicked thing in the world.The maps were totaly excelent. But alot of stuff wasent marked. Or was labeled in the wrong place. Like the steel pipe & some ammo & drinks ect.This book is great for maps and some tips but thats it.It only has 2 locations for the channeling stone.All in all this book is quite dissapointing =(
1,"In a word ""$#!^, well you know what I mean...","This book doesn't offer all the info a startegy guide should. Not to mention the fact it didn't even provide a complete list of the weapons/inventory in the game. I am utterly and bitterly disgusted with this ""stategy"" guide...to put it another way kids, DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I fully agree with most other reviewers. The guide for this game has got to be the worst I've ever used. I definitely have the feeling that the publishers rushed through this project. Truly a shame as the game itself is the creepiest of the survival horror genre. There are a number of items the guide misses like extra weapons, alternative areas of exploration and an alternate ending. You'd do better downloading a guide for free from one of the many gaming sites."
1,Terrible,"Yep, hip-hop is dead & this fool helped kill it. Give your money to charity instead of making this knucklehead rich."
1,This should have only cost 50 cents,He should have spent more time in lab with this one....The cd is atrocious....And to think he made fun of Ja Rule ....He needs to spend money on a new ghost writer...
1,"""Curtis"" is garbage","if you seen the music videos you already heard the best tracks. i get money obviously the best track. followed by ayo tech. but pretty much everything after that all sounds like stright to the bank. all the beats sound so similer. and he is still rapping about his ""gangster life"" cars, and women. its getting really old, but atleast there isnt a referance to being shot 9 times. ""curtis"" makes kanyes album look like a classic. seriously. dont waste your money. you'll do better downloading a mixtape."
1,Garbage,To put it in the simplest terms; I should have waited a day or two to download it or copy it from some other idiot who was dumb enough to buy it. There is no hardcore left in 50. For someone who wants to make money he must not care about making it with his music. Mainstream got a hold of him and he'll never produce another quality album again.
1,Garbage in Garbage out,Garbage just like the rest of hip hop. Lets sample other peoples work and sing nursery rhymes about how tough we are and how we deserve more than the next guy...does he look like an ape in this pic?
3,Better than The Massacre at least,"50 Cent's latest efforts have you thinking it was average. Most people now hate his music more than ever but this should have been his second released instead of The Massacre. There are some addictive tracks like ""I Get Money"", ""My Gun Go Off"" and even the radio hit ""Follow The Leader"" are what got me into the album but some tracks feel tedious enough for you to push stop. 50 Cent had yet to reach the potential he had on Get Rich or Die Tryin'."
1,"Like Lebron... all hype, no ring","50 cent talks about how ja rule is a singer and make girly music but 50 percent of the songs on this album are for ladies. 4 singles and only 1 worth listening to(i get money). This album laks what it could have been. The 1st couple of songs gives u that vibe u got from get rich or die tryin', but then falls off into some pop bullshh in the rest of the album. 50 cent aint a real n*gga. u cant run new york if u dont live there. His album cover best explain how u will feel after listening to currrrrrrtis!!!"
5,One of the principal books about the modern economic growth,"""Endogenous Growth Theory"" by Philippe Aghion and Peter W. Howitt is one of the best book about economic growth theory who I've seen. This book together with ""Advanced Macroeconomics"" by David Romer and ""Economic Growth"" by Robert Barro and Xavier Sala-I-Martin are the principal books about all the modern economic growth theory. I recommend very much this book."
5,Simply Awesome,"This CD was well worth the wait. This CD will help you along your spiritual journey. I was a little skeptical after the last album, but Yolanda is back in full form. The music, lyrics, and beats are uptempo and enlightening. Thanks Yolanda and God bless you."
4,Something is Missing !!,"I personaly dont feel this album is as goodas ""Mountain High Valley Low"".Something isjust missing.I really do like ""Someone watching Over you""which she sings beatiful,also ""Tonight"" isgood,""Lift Him up"" will have u joyfuland one of my other favorites is ""Better than Gold""which is song from her heart.I was looking fora little something more,I am listening to CeCe'snew one right now which I got earlyand on her album I do not getthe feeling that somthing is missing.God Bless"
5,Yolanda's Day by Day,"I a very pleased I purchased this CD.It has given me a lot of inspiration, and moments of reflection. When I'm stressed, it helps to calm and assure me. I highly recommend this CD!!"
1,"john cassavetes must have still been getting over being blown to hell in ""the fury"" when he made this turkey","john cassavetes was one of our great actors and film makers but this piece of junk he must have made to pay for one of his own directed movies ,at least i hope thats why he made this sick horror movie about demon rape and killing. it's just the worst ,not one good scare or even good scene.. a total waste of time and talent!"
3,Better than the Blair Witch Project !!!,"This early 80's indy horror classic holds up surprisingly well. Sure its pretty low budget but John Hough's brilliant direction and creative camera use makes the most out of a so so screenplay.The Incubus isnt shown until the end of the film and the Make up on it is pretty Cool looking. John Cassavette's performance is pretty solid and darkly brooding easily over shadowing the lesser acting talents here. I dont want to give away the cool twist ending but,they should have shown Cassavette's ripping some sh_t up after the revelation of the Incubus!!! That would have rocked...;)"
2,The movie is better,"I had recently rented the movie version of Captains Courageous, and it occurred to me I had never read the original book, and would like more of the background and details of the characters shown in the film. Don't bother. The movie is much better for modern audiences. I found the first part of the movie followed the book fairly closely, but the last half deviated significantly and was much more interesting. Many of the attitudes and prejudices of the late 19th century figure prominently in the book, and trying to read Kipling's attempt at writing in various accents was difficult and confusing."
5,Don't disregard the Classics,"I have been a skeptic regarding the classics. But I have had a renewal of interest because if this book Captain's Courageous. The story is beautiful and it is well written.The author tries to give some language ""flavor"" by spelling words as they would have been pronounced back then which makes the word meanings a bit tedious, but one soon gets the hang of it. It is a delightful story which I would encourage all to read, but especially teenagers.Dr. F.J. Trapani"
1,Out of Touch,"I really went into this book with an open mind and was let down. McCain is out of touch. These stories are not his own, but are just a retelling of the good works of others. In his introduction he shows how out of touch he is by telling a story about how he and his family drove through a bad neighborhood in Mexico and that somehow taught him a lot about human nature."
5,A book about character from a man of character.,"I was browsing this new book by Sen. McCain at my local bookstore and after thumbing through it, I had to buy it. In fact, I am adding it as an accessary gift at weddings and will be giving it away for Christmas as well.Sen. McCain is a man of character. His message is urgently needed. I cannot recommend this book highly enough."
5,Great book for young and old alike,"This book profiles courageous people throughout history in small distinct biographies. It's aimed at a young audience but I enjoyed it and learned a great deal reading it. During the summer, I had my sons read one each day and then we would talk about that person at the dinner table. We all enjoyed it and it kept them polished on their reading and their history through the summer."
4,The musical has improved from the Washington DC opening,"I saw this musical on opening night in Washington D.C. three years ago. In my opinion, the musical itself has been improved since that time, although I don't think Marcus Lovett can match Davis Gaines in the role of The Man. There is, as a previous reviewer has mentioned, great similarity between some of the songs in this show and Lloyd Webber's earlier shows. Vaults of Heaven and When Children Rule the World are enjoyable. However, I bought this album for one song alone, the beautiful ""If Only""."
3,"""Dear Jesus"" or ""Good Heavens!""","If you come from a personal place where all musicals are interesting, you should listen to this album. The accents ARE a bit iffy, but the singing is more than satisfactory, and the music pleasant. The enormous roadblock is the story. Escaped murderer mistaken for Christ by socially and economically disadvantaged children is hidden by them in their family's barn. Faith is tested - although it's hard to decide whether the children or the listener's faith is tested more. Without access to the book or stage directions or a synopsis of some sort, it's difficult to figure out exactly what happens at the end. Despite the superior quality of some of the songs, it is impossible to figure out what this musical's point is."
4,Andrew Lloyd Webber has changed!,"A new style, a breathtaking new style, has inspired my sudden interest in his music. Never a fan of Webber, I discovered this musical on a trip to London. For all Webber fans, it is a must. For non-Webber fans, try the highlights. It's worth it. It's a change in his music."
2,Who is that KID??,"Listening to the cd Whistle down the Wind, I noticed a boy, I think it was a boy, who sings the lyrics: I got a glass of fyreflies, they make amazing light.. I really think that he has got a beautifull voice. Well, that's it actually. Goodbye."
2,Disappointed overall in this expansion set,"We love our Apples to Apples party box and were excited to add this expansion pack to it. However my family was disappointed overall in this set because most of the cards are combos containing ampersands. For example noun cards include fame & fortune, bells & whistles, arm & a leg, etc. Adjective cards include plump & tender, hail and hearty, rough & ready, hit & miss, fast & furious, etc. My teenagers were especially annoyed by these cards because many of them are just so vague. We've tried to mix them together with the cards in the party box so that nobody gets an entire handful of them again (lots of moans when that occurred) but it'll take some time to get them all evenly distributed. I hope that expansion set 2 does not contain so many cards of this type and I'll ask around to make sure before I purchase it."
3,Game Makes Getting to Know Other Better Fun,"I have now played this game on 5 occasions with different combinations of people, some of whom I knew well and others I was just beginning to get to know. A to A made getting to know them better fun. It provoked both soul searching and laughter."
3,OK British Caper Comedy,"This film was a slight disappointment to me. I had always heard that it was a classic comedy from the Ealing Studios. I'm aware that the film won an Oscar for it's script and that Alec Guiness was nominated for his efforts here. The film is mildly engaging but seems to me a rather routine caper film. Guiness and co-star Stanley Holloway have a good chemistry. It just didn't live up to my expectations. A possible detriment is the Cockney accents of alot of the characters is rather thick and you have to strain to figure out what they're saying. On a trivial note, Christopher Hewitt, who played Roger DeBris in Mel Brooks' ""The Producers"" and the title role in TV's ""Mr. Belvedere"" has a small role as a constable."
4,The Lavender Hill Mob,This old classic movie is wonderful- the black and white photography just adds to it.If you are an Alec Guiness fan you'll love it!!
3,Too Hard!,"Wow. I hope some day to be at the level these people are! I am a moderate exerciser, not over-weight, and was only able to keep up for the first 5 minutes. The rest of the time I spent jogging on the treadmill, using the video as inspiration, telling myself that they are working much harder then I am. Some leg moves I couldn't even attempt without almost falling off.May not be a good idea if you are uncoordinated, out of shape, or overweight. Not for the novice!"
1,This is way out there...even for me,"I have a very open mind and am interested in paranormal events, but this was just unbelievable. It's embarrassing to have the book around. If someone were to pick it up and read some of it, they'd think I'm a loony tune. Sorry I bought it."
5,Darrel - life long astrology student,"Ms.Simms book is an excellent introduction to cosmobiology and uranian astrology. She explains the logical reasoning behind cosmobiology and uranian astrology in an open, honest, left brain and right brain manner. She makes the subject utterly logical and enthralling. I recommend anything she writes."
4,Practical information for those starting out,"This book is a great resource, especially for those just starting out and looking for a general idea what they'll really need to get rolling. Not a lot of meat for someone farther down the road to their dreams, but good pointers (like using a portable welder as your generator!) that save you time, money or hassle.This book is a nice change from the ""every will be rosy"" starter manuals... you know to expect problems, but that they aren't insurmountable with a little patience and ingenuity."
3,"Grat album, Mastered a little too loud","A great Frank Sinatra album at his best vocally. Being a sound engineer I must admit a bit of dissapointment at the Re-mastering of this CD....Why push the volume up so much on these old analog recordings...I understand that everyone wants to be as loud as Diana Kralls last CD, but they souldn't do it at the expense or the overall sound....Fortunatly Sinatra's voice wasn't affected much, but the big band sometimes sounds a little distorted...I'm sure it didn't on the original LP.I'm sure that most folks don't even hear these things....But there ya go."
5,Great,"This was well packaged, not damaged by post at all and was exactly what i was looking for. Just great."
3,Be careful,"I don't know if this is a lesson not to buy books on Amazon, or not to buy books online in general. I ordered it new. It got here with smudges, nicks and dings. That is not new."
1,"THE BIG BAD, MEAN AND NASTY SON OF MOTHERLESS CHICKEN WOLF?","Mr. Bruce lee is a tremendous martial artist but when it comes to filming sction sequences, he looks like a pile of conjiled sugar, whew! Hot damn! Jackie chan is better, he kicks yo mamma 'round the de world! ANYWAY BRUCE SHOULD, I HOPE HE DOES SOON!"
1,Not a movie,"When I ordered this, I thought I was getting the movie along with the additional information about Bruce Lee and the making of the film. But it was just a documentary featuring Linda Lee. Not what I wanted at all! Buyers beware!!!"
4,Present,I bought this for a friend and he loved it. He's a big Bruce Lee fan so I thought I would surprise him and he loved it.
5,ENTER THE DRAGON,THE DOUBLE DISC SET IS GREAT. IT GIVES A LOT OF BACK GROUND INFORMATION FOR THE PERSON WHO WANTS TO KNOW MORE.
5,The only watchable Bruce Lee movie,"Skip Fist of Fury and his others and buy Enter the Dragon. For one thing, it's not badly dubbed. It is almost like a James Bond movie. Lee travels to a mysterious island to fight in a martial arts tournament and bring the owner of the island to justice for various crimes. John Saxon plays an American who goes to the tournament for the money. This has Bruce Lee's most iconic moments like the room of mirrors and the tasting his own blood thing. This is one of the best action movies of the 70s so I highly recommend it."
3,Okay for a newcomer to Bruce Lee,"I don't remember ever watching Bruce Lee before and don't watch too many movies, but think this movie was decent. The acting and voices were a not very good at times and the video quality was not very high.However, it was nice to see a classic movie filmed 40 years ago that everyone praises. I liked to see how different Martial Artists live and different cultures"
5,The Movie that started it all,This movie started Kung Fu ( martial arts ) mania in the US. That pretty much says it all. Still one of the seminal martial arts movies ever. A classic you must have in your collection.
3,Good martial art but not worth fro blu ray,"good action, legend! but whether it worths to buy this in blu ray or not, i have no ideas yet.....as i dont see much different...but well,,,after all,even just 1% improvement...still u see this legend slightly clearer, a closer touch to the legend..."
5,Excellent,"I have watched this movie so many times that I stopped counting. First time was at the age of 15, but I still enjoy watching it today (being a `grown up'). One of my favorites. It is not as sophisticated as today's movies, I admit, but definitively a classic and a must for any martial arts enthusiastic."
5,Bruce Lee at his finest,"Bruce Lee is totally awesome. This movie has has everything from him applying his Jeet Kune Do philosophy to different occurrences in the movie all the way too those high pitched shouts while crushing his enemies with such ease and grace. There are even several espionage scenes that end up in mind blowing fights. This movie never lost my interest for a minute, and from this movie I learned of who this mighty Bruce Lee was and why he was the best of the best. Every moment just draws you in more and more. Without a doubt in my mind this is the greatest martial arts movie ever made!"
4,Legendary,"Just based on the number of times the plot from this movie has been copied you know it has to be amazing. A rare mix of excellent martial arts action and a good plot. Bruce Lee is a likable protagonist, the villain is obviously evil. The part that makes the movie interesting is the number of ""grey"" characters who are neither. Do yourself a favor and watch it if you've never seen it. Only downside is the 1970's attempts at visual effects by changing the frame rate a few times during a fight scene."
2,"Chris, Colorado Springs","Vunaks pretty good. I just find some of the things that he teaches a bit lacking in the sense that there are better methods and explanations out there. I think Vunak is pretty good though. I'd suggest borrowing this instead of buying though.I read the reviews and someone was from Colorado Springs! If anyone is looking for the best instruction they can get in Colorado Springs, I'd suggest the defense institute. They are top notch. Look them up and see for yourself."
1,No cigar,"As a martial practitioner since childhood, I only find a mixture of Wing chun labelled as Jeet jun do, half baked grappling and bits and pieces of phillipino martial arts in this book. There is no comparison to the latest proven Brazilian jujitsu books currently available in the market. Spend your hard earned money into an author or an art that is well proven. Do not believe in anyone of the self proclaimed street fight experts who has never put his art in open competition but rather hide it in the dark alley."
5,A great book,"Paul Vunak wrote a great book on street fights, the one the real man has to deal with, not the... ""all hits banned"" he may find on a dojo mat.When you're on the street you simply have to do one thing: NOT GET HURT, and you may do this only having developed your ""killing"" istinct, i.e. that state of mind in which you've reprogrammed your istinct not to be a bunny-hearted loser but a fierce fighter, a 21st century warrior.Vunak, coming from his vast experience with SEALs and martial arts helps the reader to handle tough situations reacting well. As a self defense instructor I found that all the principles shown in this book are the real ones you use in a real fight, so I suggest all people, both unexperienced and skilled martial artist as well as women, to deeply read and understand and so APPLY those principles, if they don't want to hardly and painfully discover that real fights are mayhems and you can get badly hurt unless you fight for life."
2,Foolish photos,"This book contains photographs of some of the women I admire most. Unfortunately, the women are posed holding a large sword as a prop to indicate their fearlessness.I suppose that this was the feature that ""sold"" the book idea, but I would much prefer portraits of my heroines without the sword. The sword is a symbol of much more than fearlessness, and detracts from the book. It makes the book corny.My husband bought it for me for mother's day last year; I'd guess from an amazon recommendation -- but it was a most disappointing gift -- one that I would never leave out for others to view. This wouldn't be true if the swords weren't in every photo."
5,"on the track, leon redbone",I used to have the record. Oops that dates me. Good to listen to Redbone again.
5,PERFECT,"Rachel is somewhat annoying with all of her faces expressions...but I tell you what! This DVD and all of signing time volumes are excellent source of learning ASL! My son had speech issue and he was already 22 months. I got the DVDs because i heard it can help them communite and improve speech. He went from babbling to speaking and signing everything he saw on the DVDs in just 2 months. And this is 2 months of watching several volumes not just this one! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND GETTING IT!! The way she teaches makes them stay interested. Its not just her, she have her daughter and many other kids to sign, which makes it easier for your child to sign because, every kid have their own easier way to sign it. I am so glad i got it...we are slowly buying the rest of the volumes. SO WORTH IT!!!"
1,wrong item,"this was a repeat of a lot of the parts on the real volume 2. I'm upset b/c I realized when looking at the official website that Volume 3 is actually in a blue box and is called ""a new day."" I think this may be an illegitimate volume?"
5,My Hero,"This is a great selection of earlier ""Hoppy"" films.Echo Bridge did an excellent job of re-mastering these films especially considering that they are all over 75 years old. Almost as old as I am. The one thing that they messed up on was listing who the supporting players were. Of the 8 that they list only 1 is actually in this selection; Russell Hayden.George Hayes, who I consider the #1 all-time favorite, western hero's ""sidekick"", was omitted from the list and he is actually in all 10 of the films in this collection playing several different roles.My message to all Hopalong Cassidy/William Boyd fans is that this is a ""must"" collection that you need to add to your DVD library."
4,Not bad at all,"The diamonds in the picture are nothing close to the size they look in the picture but the ring is awesome and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone for the price. Hands down, no doubt. The ring looks amazing for the price. Just don't expect the diamonds to look as big as they do in the picture."
3,A thinking man's Haddaway,"Having high expectations, anticipating something new and something that would blow me away, I was a little dissapointed in this CD. What could have been a sensual and mood-inducing dance album is totally ruined by annoying rapping thrown in every now and then. ""Shining Iron Face"" is really good though. But either than that, I would classify this with c+c music factory or 2 unlimited...dance music cheese"
3,It's heavy,I bought this product because of excellent review. Here are some comments after using it for a few months.Pros- Heavy duty- Perfectly sized for me (not too big nor too small)- Universal utility blade. Can be bought from nearby storesCons- It's heavy. I never used the belt clip. Pulls my pants down because of its weight. There are lighter steels that can be used.- Does not fold completely (180 degrees). There are about 20 degree angle left open.- Not impressed with the patented locking mechanism
5,Buy this knife,"This is the best utility knife I've ever laid eyes on. It was love at first sight. The knife exudes top notch quality and durability for many years to come for the price of a buffet lunch. Pros are as follows:- Looks and feel high quality and durable, wood grain handle is a nice touch- Clever blade release/locking and folding mechanism- Price is good- Easy to change blades- Slim and compact, doesn't get in the way and gets in more placesI only wish there was a place for an extra blade or two, but the knife is so compact its understandable that there isn't one."
3,Nice and well built,"I have owned this knife since june of 2009 and it still works well.The only problem is finding blades that fit right.The Stanley 11-921 heavy duty are just a lttle too long but they do fit inside the slot,but the lever that locks it down will not close right,you have to force it closed with pliers.Need blades that fit properly?"
1,VERY HARD,"MY DD has trouble with solid foods but loves the puffs. I ordered this to get some variety from the standard gerber puffs/ sticks. Unfortunately I ordered a pack of six thinking that these would have a similar texture to the other snacks. These snacks are hard for ME to chew and actually cut the roof of my husbands mouth when he tried them. At first we thought it was just a bad canister, but when we opened the next canister... same issue.IF your child is to the point where they can chew these... they certainly are not in a stage where they need puffs anymore!Would not recommend."
4,Smelly Kid!,"My son, age 2, loves this line of products from Gerber. The only bad thing about this particular product is that he REEKS of maple syrup the day after having these for snack (no more than 1/2 cup size serving). It is a 3 feet away and can smell maple syrup type of odor - even after wash hands, face, and taking a bath."
1,Painful to listen to,"This collection has many great songs, but the sound quality is disappointing. Madacy encoded each track with an encoder called UV22. It makes the music sound like it's being played through a cheap stereo with the base and treble turned all the way up. The sound quality is grainy and the detail in Kenny Rogers voice is washed out. There are many Kenny Rogers collections available. I recommend buying one by someone other than Madacy."
2,Defective,Unfortunately it looks like a I got a defective one. The actuator appears to have a mind of its own. It opens and closes the rec-door after I turn the engine off but it does't do anything when I press the button for the rec-door. Hopefully I can get a replacement soon.
1,ONLY BUY IF YOU HAVE NEVER PLAYED THE LOTTERY,I WAS LOOKING FOR SOME TIPS ON THE LOTTERY-DIDNT FIND IT IN THIS VIDEO-THE VIDEO IS A BASIC DESCRIPTION OF DIFFERENT LOTTOS AND HOW TO MARK TICKETS ETC.- II WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED-HE SHOULD HAVE PUT FOR THE NOVICE OR BEGINNERS ON THE COVER-SO I WOULDNT HAVE WASTED MY MONEY.
4,A good starting point,"To the author's credit he has atleast shown the way to a VM design, even if the design has some problems. If a good enough programmer gets his or her hands on this book, they can build on it and take it to the next level with some effort. The book is not meant to teach C or C++ and that is not the intent of the book either. Consider the code accompanying the book as the first iteration of a VM that needs to be refined further."
2,Come on. Virtual Machine and C/C++?,"This book is more about ""actual"" machine emulation. The so call virtual machine in the book is awfully close to a real machine. The idea of building a virtual machine is to have an higher level of abstraction. Virtual machines are usually designed with a specific kind of programming language in mind. Virtual machines are designed so language designers can build their language on top of a higher level of abstraction. What's the point of building a VM that looks like x86?I skim through the book, and didn't find any information that could be useful for the VM I was building. It talks a lot about how a real machine works and how to simulate it in software. The C/C++ code in the book is not that bad, but I guess we should expect a bit more from someone who wrote a book with C/C++ in the title. There are plenty of bad examples in the book that may mislead novice C++ developers."
1,Nice for beginners,"When I read about this book, I thought it would be *the* reference on virtual machines. Quote from backcover: ""Discusses in detail (...) --everything expected from a commercial run-time system"". It is true that some interesting features such as multi-threading and garbage collection are *explained*, but NOT implemented. The author writes he wanted to keep things simple. These features are quite important, and also expected from a commercial run-time system. The VM that results is quite simple, and could be easily programmed by any programmer with some experience and insight. For people who are looking for much detail on threads and other interesting stuff, go look for something else."
1,worst technical book I ever bought,"A vanity book that no decent publisher should print.Material about the stated subject is so outdated to be laughable.Otherwise filled with totally irrelevant, ill-informed, pretentious material. Mostly useless code listings."
2,Nice idea but limited durability,"I've got a collection of Keep Calm stuff and thought this was an ideal addition - unfortunately within a couple of days the front ""Keep Calm"" emblem fell off. Thanks to Amazon's stellar service they sent me a replacement, but it's still going to happen because the emblem is just stuck on the metal bottle opener with glue."
4,What could have been,"Like some of the other customers have already said. I think shorty was definately an up and coming artist, that could have had a successful career with the right label support behind her.I remeber watching the slow down video, at the time i was 13 in the 8th grade. But even back then just seeing shorties style and swagger gave me some grown man desires. She definately had star potential, a beautiful voice, as well as beautiful physical attributes to match.That i think would have combined to make her an up and coming star in the making. Its crazy because at the time Tyson Beckford was just an apsiring model in her video, now look at how things have turned out so differently for the two of them."
5,Tennessee Ernie Ford Sweet Hour of Prayer,"This was purchawed for a 93 year old lady and she was most excited to receive the C D, every song on this is truly wonderful as good Gospel music should be and by one of the legends of Country Gospel."
4,Great product,"I really like Vaseline Lip Therapy. It does a great job keeping your lips smooth. I re-apply it every hour or so which is the case for every lip balm I have tried. The only downfall is that it does not have any SPF , otherwise a great product."
2,Not much of a book,"I was very disappointed in what little there was in terms of content. For the amount of money this bookcosts they could have put in more things relevant for a baby, not their parents."
1,do not buy,"The top did not fit into the stand...it was loose therefore useless.could not tighten it...problem ""Made in China"" Do not buy this item."
1,Lucky it was the final voyage.....,"Some people like ""B"" grade movies.....but not when they have so little action or romance to offer. The cast are so wooden, that even Ice T can't liven things up.Erika Eleniak has obviously struggled since Baywatch and will not get many offers after this.Imagine ""Speed 2"", but worse."
3,Giant Gaping Hole,"The orangutan looks exactly like the picture, and our 3 year old nephew loves it. However, when we got it there was a huge hole in a seam on the back of the orangutan. It was pretty easy to sew back shut, but seriously? Kind of curious if this orangutan made a quick trip to Columbia and back before being delivered to us."
3,I hope you don't have nipples,"I'm a usual 38D, but I ordered a 36D for the support. It's fine along the ribs, but still leaves a lot of bounce. Also, trying this on indoors, I was a bit horrified to see it didn't do anything to conceal nipples. It isn't cold inside and I'd say I'm average in that department, but they were... Very showcased with this sports-bra. Hoping it would go away once I put a shirt on, I tried. No avail, though. I have never once had this problem, but it looks the same as if I hadn't worn a bra at all."
3,High impact?,"This bra is tagged ""high impact"", which is why I ordered it. I run, do kick boxing, aerobics and fast walk. I was excited to open the box today and put it on. Very pretty shade of blue. Looks nice on. Very flattering. Extremely comfortable. Easy to put on and adjust straps. However, when I stood in front of the mirror and jumped up and down for the ultimate test, I saw bouncing. I'm not that big (32D), but want the ""girls"" to stay in place. So, I would not consider this bra for high impact. I like it, but will only be using it for pilates. Unfortunately, I'm back to the starting line in finding my second support bra."
5,Fantastic Sports Bra,"This is the best sports bra I've ever owned. I'm a 40DD and it is impossible to find a bra that is supportive, comfortable, and doesn't squish the girls. The Fiona bra does all of this. I use it for running, playing football, weight lifting, biking - it's great for both high impact and low. It's more comfortable than any of my other bras. I highly recommend it for anyone who is well endowed!"
5,Love it. Very Comfortable. Very helpful as a sports bra,"This is the best sports bra. It's cute, since it looks like a tank top. It works!! Very supportive. Best Part...it's super comfortable. Love it!"
5,Best sports bra I've every worn,I love this bra. It has great support without being too tight and difficult to put on. In fact its worked really well so far in my pregnancy as a day-to-day bra in which my shape is changing. I think this would work well as a nursing bra.
5,Love this sports bra,"I love these sports bras. They don't bind, chafe, the girls feel safe and secure and for a DD that is IMPORTANT!!! I run streets and trails in these bras and don't have one complaint about them."
5,Amazing support,"I ordered two of these in black and white 36DD and WOW. Got the girls packed down, very comfortable, and minimal bounce! I jumped up and down in front of the mirror and was astounded by the difference they made. I'm used to struggling to find good bras for my bust size. These are solid. The shoulder strap is highly adjustable with a velcro bottom that simply sticks and stays stuck to the material at whatever length you choose. At the price I paid on Amazon, this is a steal; half the cost of my Victoria Secret bras, way more supportive, and sleek looking to boot. I just may convert to these as my daily drivers!I bought these for my Appalachian trail thru hike. I have yet to try them out at the gym, but I'm confident they will hold up great."
3,Opinion,This is a comfortable bra that stays in place. I would purchase it again. I purchased it after a surgery and have been pleased.
3,Not Great For Elliptical Training,"I had researched many sports bras on Amazon, as well as on other sites before deciding on the Fiona. I had high expectations, but was disappointed with its performance. I ordered the 36c, which is my normal size. The fit was snug, which I had expected. The fully adjustable straps were wonderful. When I began my workout on the elliptical, I noticed there was still considerable ""bounce"". I tried to make the straps shorter, but that did little to help, and the bra became uncomfortable. I decided to keep it and wear it under a bra top for my workouts. Perhaps it wasn't the appropriate bra for my figure type. I am in my mid-forties and I will leave it at that! I would suggest giving it a try though, as it has several features not found on most other sports bras."
3,Won't get fooled again,"The picture makes it look like it is stiff, but it is not contoured at all. Just made of stretchy material."
4,Very pleasantly surprised!,"Great bra for larger cup sizes. I was skeptical about a bra without an underwire, but this bra was comfortable and provided very good support without quishing. The only complaint is that the dark color bled a little bit onto my tank top after a sweaty spin class so I recommend washing a few times before wearing. I will be buying a few other colors."
2,reeeeally tight,"i'm actually not a 32B but am a 30B/C, and got this thinking, sports bras are usually too tight so why not try the next size up? well, this was so tight i had to return it. i could barely breathe with it on, and it squashed my chest without supporting it. felt like one of those chest-binder things. the good: it's clearly very well-made with high-quality fabric."
2,Absolutely NOT for larger cup sizes,"Despite the Moving Comfort ""bra finder"" on their website giving this bra as an option for a 40DD doing high impact activities such as running, I found this bra to be almost completely lacking in support. By the end of my run, I was clutching my boobs in my hands to keep them from knocking me unconscious.Additionally, the lining is only stitched to the body of the bra at the edges, so after wear, the bottom band has rolled up so much that the lining is all but hiding the main fabric.It looks like Enell is going to be my next stop."
4,Best full-bust sports bra ever!,"I just Love the features-closure in back so you control the fit, adjustable velcro straps in front so you control the lift, ribbed band at bottom is comfortable yet supports. Had problems locating the item locally and when I did, my size was not available and the retail price was $42. I got em at Amazon for $29 and in my size!"
3,Its okay,The Bra squishes the chest giving a uniboob look. I wear a 34D so this was not the greatest for me. If you want a better bra that separates the chest try lululemon's boob's on a wire bra. Best i had worn so far.This Bra is still good if you want to do weigh training or non aerobic workout. It'll get the job done.
2,Not comfortable at all,I read the reviews and ended up ordering this bra. I'm a 40D - this thing was not comfortable at all. Sure it had support but I ended up returning it.
2,far from great,"If you're a petite woman, I do not recommend this bra. To achieve any control of the bouncing at all, I had to pull the straps so tight, that the bra almost cuts into my armpits, because it's sides are too wide."
1,Strange fit,"I returned this. Even though I ordered the same size I ordinarily would for a sports bra, it was a very strange fit. The band was fine, but the cups were too big. I've had trouble with this brand before & will not bother trying any of their other styles."
3,Too tied to the philosophical argument,"The book starts off great with the apple and ends well with the potato. But in the middle Pollan loses what makes his books often so interesting. I enjoy Pollan's personal telling of the narrative. How he inserts himself into the history of the plant he is discussing. I also enjoy the quirky details he relates in the history. But he really pushes this Dionysian vs. Apollonian ideals concept throughout the book. At points the book, especially the tulip chapter, seems thin and heavily molded to this ideals debate. I didn't gain too much from this thesis and actually felt a bit beaten over the head by it. I get wanting a unified theme but it just came off as a long winded lecture that did little to illuminate the best portions of the text."
3,A good read for the non-scientist,"As a botanist myself, I applaud any book that leads others into the green world around us. As has been mentioned in other reviews, however, the accuracy of much of what he says - from a scientific point of view - is to be taken with a grain of salt. Horticulture and agriculture, for example, are intertwined in a way that is misleading.His forthcoming PBS special of the same name should be interesting and enjoyable for all of those who love gardening, taking walks in the park, and stimulating to those who simply like educational programs in general.From a botanist's standpoint though, his ""argument"" that some species use or manipulate people to ensure their own survival is nothing new - it's been argued and pointed out for over 100 years (at least) by biologists and ethnobotanists.I'll enjoy watching it as well, and I encourage other interested in nature to read his book and watch the PBS special!"
3,"Good read, but not Pollan's best work....","Having read and enjoyed Pollan's more recent works, I looked forward to reading this one. While it was a worthwhile read, I did not find it as informative or enjoyable as his other books.The book tells the story from the point of view of the garden rather than of the gardener. Pollan speaks for 4 plants (apples, tulips, cannabis, and potatoes) that have quite successfully recruited another species (us) to spread their genes across the globe. Historically informative (who knew that Johnny Appleseed was more interested in Apple Jack than Apple Pie), at times humorous (Pollan's own brief career as a cannabis grower is hilarious), and even insightful; Pollan is certainly a gifted author telling an interesting story. I believe I would have enjoyed it more had I not already read Pollan's other books."
3,Botany of Desire Review,"There is a lot of fascinating information in this book, but I won't lie-- it's extremely hard to read and doesn't at all capture the reader's interest. Pollan rambles on about unnecessary information and takes many pages before getting directly to his point."
4,Fantastic Journey,"This book was written like a romance novel with twists and turns all along the way. The author uses deep and rich imagery to entice the reader. Although I'm not an apple connoisseur I was thrilled to learn there are so many other varieties to explore such as a purple apple. I was fascinated to learn about the virus that causes tulips to ""break"" and display stray streaks of color. Although potatoes are not a staple in my diet the author's store about its history and how it brought people out of and back into poverty was fascinating. I highly recommend this book. A fantastic journey through the history of our intimate relationship with plants."
1,Misleading information,"I, like some of the others, purchased this product with high expectations. After spending close to two hours preparing for installation, I realized that there was no audio input thus my TV cannot be connected. Bummer. Also, the only wireless speaker is the rear one. Also, the FM tuner will not receive any stations. Do yourself and your customers a favor and pull this from the market. I will be returning it."
1,Stay away from this dog,I cannot warn you enough to NOT buy this system. It only includes one rear speaker although Amazon's description says it comes with two. It does not have any outputs to connect to your TV so you're only limited to having surround sound when watching DVDs (and when listening to the the built in radio tuner that didn't work for me at all).There weren't any reviews on this page when I just bought this a week ago and I wish I didn't break my own rule of always reading reviews on a product before buying it! Don't make the same mistake that I did - you can get a lot more bang for your buck with other systems (I ended up picking up a Yamaha YHT-160 and I love it!)
2,Buyer Beware,Not real happy with this purchase. The pots were scratched and the quality was not good. It looks as though there were areas that had rust marks or problems and they were scratched away. I guess this would be an o.k. starter set for a young person but not good as a gift since these pots were badly scratched. Think twice befor buying.
5,The #1 TOMB RAIDER III Strategy Guide.,"Ahh, Lara Croft. Ever the adventurer, ever the explorer, and ever the game-maker. And for her latest adventure, you need this strategy guide. Kip Ward is the best authority on the Tomb Raider series, and the screenshots and comprehensive hints will make you pleased about your purchase. If you're having trouble beating that level, or can't seem to find that darn key, the TOMB RAIDER III STRATEGY GUIDE by Kip Ward will have you finished the game in no time, and then some."
3,The secrets are kept a secret.,"This book is...ok.The only quam i have with it is, there's about 6 secrets that aren't even put in the book. And for those of you who do know, Tomb Raider III contains a secret level called ""All Hallows"" which is accessable only if you find all 60 of 59 secrets. (no, that's not a typo.)...ok four. Now let me think...There's 1 missing in ""Temple Ruins"", 1 in ""The River Ganges"", 1 in ""Mudubu Gorge"", and if you're going crazy trying to find that one in ""Aldwych"", its in the same room you get into with the ""Ornate Star"". Just turn around and look up.The only reason i did this is because we're waiting patiently for the ""Angel of Darkness"" to come out. But if you get bored...try getting all the secrets, because ""All Hallows"" is kinda fun.But yeah...the book gives good hints and tips on how to get through the game, and places to find medi-paks and ammo and all that good stuff.So, if you're buying a used one, i'd definately recommend it."
4,Take this Prima Strategy Guide for all it's worth!,"This guide has some pitfalls, but all in all, I think it has every thing a kid needs to complete TRIII. By the way, I am an old guy @ 38 years. I've been playing TR for 2 years now and have followed Laura through thick and thin. I also have the cheat codes for TRIII, TRII and TR. Without these, you ain't gona make it. Also, most kids are not patient enough to complete the levels in the TR series. My persistence is what got me this far along with Prima's Guide!"
5,A guide for those on the path,"This book is amazing. If you find yourself on ""the path,"" this is a must read."
5,"Killer, Fresh, Heavy Metal!","Angra.....What can I say? They are a fairly new group to the metal scene, but, these guys know how to R-O-C-K! Angra brings a unique quality to metal that may be compared to groups like Fates Warning & Helloween, but they are NOT a copy of these groups. They are Fresh, they are talented, and they are a group that needs to be heard! Each song on the cd is terriffic. Not a cd that you will be dissapointed with. If you like great guitar playing, killer vocals, and if you like great progressive metal, these guys are for you!"
4,Excellent potential......,"Fireworks is definitely Angra's finest work to date. The vocals need to be toned down a bit and the drummer should not abuse the double bass so often though. I think if these fellas relax a bit they could put out a CD that would match the quality of Dream Theater, Fates Warning or Enchant."
2,Toshiba SD-V394 DVD/VCR Combo,The vcr was broke after 1 week of owning it. The company did replace it and I didn't have to pat for shipping it back.
3,There's a new player in town,"This is Bryan Smith's 2nd novel (the first House of Blood I also reviewed and enjoyed) and I think that he is a new and fresh horror writer. This book is about Hannah Starke a young woman who's marrying the love of her life Mike and has everything going for her. That is until she is killed and becomes the first zombie brought to life by the Deathbringer. The book is fast and it gets right to the point in the first chapter, no long introduction to the walking undead. I think that Smith shows a lot of promise as a horror author, although I may have enjoyed his first book just a tad better. But still I think Deathbringer is worth reading, it is gory, visceral and a fast read."
1,go back to truck driving.,"cause you cant write. again i read these reveiws and wonder what book they read? i read this book and was just amazed at how bad it was. impossible storylines, weak characters that you hope all die. i read the freakshow after this and decided then and there that i will never read another book by bryan smith. and wont trust these amazon reveiws either. how in hell did anyone give this 5 stars?? its horrible. boring and ......eh!"
1,Juvenile and weak,"I just tried to read death bringer and made 300 before I just started skimming and skipped to the end. The book was rather dull, needlessly gore (the scenes of violence added no sense of fear and where just way over the top), predictable, and worst of all just plain boring. I hate writing a poor review of someone's hard effort and I am sure the author is a talented and hard working writer but it does not show in this book. Furthermore based on the number of high reviews for this book I was just surprised about how really bad it is. I wonder if I just have way to high standards or if the other reviewers actually read the same book as me?"
4,Cesar Romero,"Obscure horror period piece. Poe's wife Lenore, after taken for dead and almost being buried alive, is committed to a mental hospital where something sinister is afoot. With Robert Walker, Jr. as Poe and Cesar Romero as the sinister Dr. Grimaldi, also with Carol Ohmart."
4,"""More than this""? Of course!!! But not in this CD...","First of all, I like Roxy/Ferry, but I can't believe this cd does not include wonderful tracks like ""Lover"" (remember MIAMI VICE?), ""My only love"" and ""Bete noire"". However, it has the rest of the good ol' ones. Buy it"
5,really great.......,"How does this chocolate differ from other bars? For starters, it's South American (Venezuelan, to be specific). The Cocoa level is about 80%. This is the real deal! This bar is more chocolate, than anything else. It has a wonderful, bittersweet quality, and is very distinctive. I feel like I am tasting the Cocoa plant for the first time, and it isn't cloyingly sweet, like some bars. This is definitely for chocolate snobs......specifically, dark chocolate lovers......."
1,Misleading,"I know there was only one review on this product and it was positive.The description says that it will learn most codes through the otherremote. I tried ""learning"" with a Sony DVD player remote and a GPXboombox remote. Neither one worked. I had to return the product.Very dissatisfied."
4,Getting There,"There isn't as much of the thrashing that dominated their good - not great - first CD. There are, however, signs of actual hooks that indicate the band is capable of doing more than shredding guitars, unleashing guttural screams and slamming away on the pads. Get this as a warm-up for Silence."
2,This book is very distrubing and is not very satifying,"This book was okay. I tells of a girl named Tish who is sexually abused by her step father. This book really told me about what sexual abuse does to a person. It was very informtive and full of emotion, but the ending was very unsatisfying and the book itself wasn't very good. Cnythia Voigt is my favorite author and I love the Tillerman cylce, which I sugest you read, but this book disapointed me!Chesley BurrussThe American School In JapanTokyo"
4,A great book about parenting!,"Aside from the title, this book is great. Kids, as the author points out, aren't inherently ""bad"" and I think many parents who could benefit from this book won't pick it up because their kids aren't ""delinquents."" Anyway, I liked the messages and it was an easy read...why hasn't Hayes written more?"
1,A Disapppointing Biography,"These biographical vignettes surely represent the experiences of many immigrants to the US. But they also describe the problems faced by most families as they struggle with the challenges of personal differences, adolescence, bad luck, and poor decisions. As a result it failed to inspire either my sympathy for the characters or a sense of need for immigration and/or social reform. Sadly, it is boring. The style is not professional; it is not even ""good writing"". I expected a story of hope and inspiration or a call to activism but was disappointed. I regret my reaction. Perhaps it would have been different had the story been told by a seasoned author."
1,What a load of Rubbish.! There is not a no-star category,This is an incredibly badly researched book with so many mistakes. So Sad.
2,Power switch problem,"I only had this case for about a week and the power switch gets stuck. It seems that the manufacture is using faulty springs. This is a simple case, but most important you need to turn the power on."
4,4 stars is true,"the wizard's convention is a correct name for this album, it features ex deep purple members such as Ian Gillan, David Coverdale, Glenn Hughes, Tommy bolin, Ritchie Blackmore, and the related musicians like DIO, Bernie Marshden who had worked with some DP members in the past. Very good combination! this is a ""Must have"" for DP fans around the globe."
5,You must read this book before you die!,"As it says on the jacket (or sleeve?) of one of these 3 books, it is dangerous reading on a bus because its nearly impossible to not burst out laughing. I was waiting at a bus stop recently in San Francisco and a lone young man reading a paperback book was unable to suppress his laughter. I took a surreptitious look at the title and I wasn't suprised to discover that it was 'Side Effects'! I treasure my copy of ""The Complete Prose.."" and I highly, strongly recommend it to everyone! I've given it as a gift and the recipients have always been amazed at how incredibly, ceaselessly, mercilessly funny it is. READ IT! READ IT! READ IT! -the empress of adverbs"
1,Not impressed by book contents,"I was holding my breath to finish reading the book. Unfortunately I was so disappointed. The book doesn't talk FEA in manufacturing applications at all, all info is so obsolete. All contour plots really tells nothing technically. Hope it should be revised soon."
5,A must read,"I read a lot. My favourite genre is short stories, and this is a collection not to miss. In each story the narrator is so compelling that you need to read to see what happens to her. The voice of each narrator is strong and true, and even though she may be flawed or merely an observor of a bigger story within she speaks authentically. All the characters drawn around the main character are sometimes given only the briefest of qualities yet those are the very qualities needed to bring the story to life. I am writing this review before I even finish the book because I do not want to finish it. I want it to last. If you have time to read one book this summer, read this one. You will not be disappointed. This is one gifted writer."
1,"Great artist, but unforgivable CD error","I was furious when I bought this CD! To add to what has already been said, I owned the 45 way back when, and there was NOT a ""single"" version of the song ""American Pie"". The whole 8+ minutes was on the 45 record, unedited, but split between side A and side B (and labeled part one and part two). Only part one, the FIRST HALF of the song, is on this CD. Really unbelievable. The rest of the songs are really good, but, as has been said, don't even bother listening to the title track!"
4,"Up and Down, but mostly up","Most of REM's greatest songs are here, but you must also wade through a few too many clunkers."
3,Disappointing!,"Compared to the earlier Northern Exposure stuff, 'Expeditions' is too repetetive. The balance is toward beat rather than melody. All in all a decent cd... but nowhere near as good as Sasha & Digweed have done before. The only standout track is Mike Koglin's ""Enjoy the Silence"" on disc 2."
3,Great album !,Can somebody tell me why the last three songs on the first disc of my Expeditions album are different than the track listings on this web page. I was looking forward to hearing Sarah McLachlan's vocals from Delerium's silence. Please email me at Brandaman3@aol.com if you can answere this question or tell me where can get the copy that has that song on it.
4,Good starting place for solo career,"While this recording may not be as eye opening, or as melodic as her album, it still marks her potential and also the simplicity of her message mixed with the difficulty living out her romantic life. I find that there's just enough substance on this to keep me coming back to reiterate the messages. Of course two songs on this made it to the album, but they are different versions and these are more subdued and minimalistic so they're interesting to listen to. ""These Girls"" is a great and somewhat cynical song that works well off of the tragedy in ""Would You Please"" right before it. Vocally, her maturity is right on for this, but the music has the electronic influence Beth Orton and others and it doesn't really sound as if Rachael is comfortable with that, which is the only reason that I'm giving the Ep four stars instead of five. Otherwise, it's pretty good, but not genius. I think she'll have plenty of time to show us that later."
3,A great read for any recovering corporate stiff,"I found this to be an engaging story of the rise and demise of a corporate workaholic, but happily without the objectivist one-way ticket to true oblivion. In addition to a hard-to-put-down story line, Reider's protagonist has something for everyone -- the archetype of ""poor kid makes good and becomes modern successful company man"" with a mythology that reasonates sometimes too close to home. Don't expect any how-to, though; whatever your profession, behind this story are the clues to your own destiny, and maybe a wake-up call to yield to it and find your own ""footpath back home."""
3,"Love the show, but the DVD...not so great","I love The Girls Next Door, I have all the seasons, watch every episode, its a really fun and entertaining show. But the dvd...leaves something to be desired. Its really cheaply put together, not a box set, just three discs in one container. The commentary has a lot of reverb, and sounds like it was recorded in a tin can. Since this is one of the last seasons with the Girls in the Mansion, I wish this dvd set could have honored them better with a little more quality. If you like the show, get the set, but don't expect too much."
2,really not what i was expecting,"I have the first 3 seasons already. They come in these really nice boxes with a sleeve for each disc. SO, I was expecting to receive something similar. Unfortunately, this season the discs come in a cheap plastic holder with 3 spots to hold the discs . It just looks really cheap. I love the GND but this season dvds looks really cheap"
4,For Colored Girls,"Good showing on DVD. I had heard of the play and never had a chance to see it. This was a very good movie, clear and concise."
1,Don't waste your money,"I agree with the other reviewer: it's too small, hard to clean, and my handle won't stay attached to the basket. I wish I never bought this deep fryer. It also takes forever to heat up. It would only be worth the money if it cost less than $20."
5,Dr Hook cd,"CD was received, good condition, in a timely manner. I am very satisfied. I would not hesitate to do business again with this seller."
2,Grammar deserves better,"I am using this booklet to help me study Romanian.Grammar is explained but, as a book for learning, it lacks a lot of text. I blame that on the publisher as well as another point of criticism: Romania had another spelling reform. Time to revise, Hippocrene!!For all the work done on this special language a 'well done' to Christina."
1,written by a child?,Another silly language/grammar book... Who can make good use of it? Who wrote that?
1,Software -C at best,Not well thought out and many features that are on the PC version are NOT on the MAC version .. I'd rate it a -C.
1,Terrible Program!,"I used 3D Home Architect for years on a PC, going back several years. I finally found this program for the Mac, and was hopeful, but the program is useless. The interface is not intuitive, and nothing seems to work the way it should. Even simple features like copy and paste seem to fail. What a disappointment!"
3,Great Features - Could use a Tutorial,"This product has everything I am looking for to play around with home remodel ideas, but it could use a basic tutorial that demonstrates how to draw a house and the property landscapes. I am trying to draw a simple ranch with an exposed basement and cathedraled ceilings. Where do I begin? The book is useful, but I've made a lot of mistakes trying to do the simple basics of a house. Besides, who wants to read with today's technology. I still haven't figured out how to walk through the house. Thankfully the fly over view works. I'd pay for a simple tutorial."
1,"Bought It, Hating It","I bought this because I'm trying to go ""all Mac"", and I had enjoyed it's PC-based predecessor. But this version, for the Mac... I get errors when I try to print a model to assemble. There's no framing editor, and no lumber estimator! Worst of all, when my architect friend asked me to export into DXF or DWG format - these are industry-standard formats - that is when I found out 1) Punch! does not export to either, and 2) no other commercial app reads ""Punch"" format. So frustrating!"
2,Intuitive Home Design...,"I've used Punch! Super Home Suite for years (on a PC) so I figured the learning curve wouldn't be such a big deal for Home Design Studio. I was so wrong. Apparently by ""intuitive interface"" they mean you have to be a psychic intuitive in order to figure out how things work. There were some improvements made from earlier editions and definitely more features - still limited to only 3 floors though - and some things that should have been simple - intuitive even, were unnecessarily complex multi-step procedures (like the second floor automatically sitting on top of the first floor.)The short and simple of it: I was disappointed."
2,Not Ellen's best...,"As a discliple of Ellen Barrett I was fairly disappointed with this video. The moves just aren't as measured and graceful as in her other videos.It also pains me to see these fair skinned girls squinting in the sun on a beach as they work up a sweat. I think the producers thought this would somehow be soothing, but it drives me crazy.Furthermore, I did not enjoy the Conde Nast advertising. ick.Buy Ellen Barrett's ""Crunch"" dvd's. They're fabulous."
5,Great Ellen Barrett aerobics DVD,"One of my favorite Ellen Barrett fitness DVDs. This workout is almost entire aerobics, with a brief toning segment at the end."
5,Awesome!,"This CD totally blew me out of the water. I ordered a bunch of old Eurobeat CD's from Amazon the other day, but this one was the best of the bunch by far. By the fourth song you'll be tempted to go back to the beginning and start again before you finish the CD...trust me, this is THAT good. This is money well spent if you like 80's dance music, but with a 90's remix feel to it!"
5,FUNNY STUFF!!!,This movie is hilarious! Anyone that puts Chevy Chase into a movie is just a pure genious!!!!!!!!!
3,Norman Rockwell meets Steven King!,"What always gives me a chuckle is the town of Rosebud, a beautifully quaint village populated by such despicable people! Not the best comedy in the world, but underrated."
1,Disappointed,"When we viewed this movie on TV, it did not contain profanity. We purchased it because it was so funny, and we wanted to share it with our grandchildren. That will not happen. Your review should have stated not appropriate for children because of language."
3,"Bad tittle,something a Chevy Chase fan would like!","The Name Funny Farm is quite un-atractive it seems that there was quite a struggle to the writers whean it came to nameing wise..Like I seiad it is something a Chevy Chase fan would like, I also see why Blockbuster doesnt even have it!. I think the only reason some people like it was becuase it stared Chevy Chase. I think I could have add-ed a little more humer to it or atleast make it more enteraning it seemed that the writers keep that it was a comady in the back of there heads instead of trying to write comady all over the movie!The DVD is quite poor to Just LAnege selectionScene Selection and interactive menuNot even the trailor to the movie!but it is quite doubtful that Warner Brothers would want to make a special edition on this movie."
3,Funny Farm DVD,It's kinda funny if you think about how screwed up some neighbors can really be. Sometimes you have to laugh at things like that to get you through the day.
2,language,Was disappointed when I watched it. I did not remember foul language when it was aired on television.I'd like to sell it.
5,Great Movie. Let it Grow on You!,"When I first saw this movie, I thought it was pretty bad. But I wasn't paying attention and over the years this has grown on me. There aren't any real belly laughs. But this is a very funny movie nonetheless. Chevy Chase doesn't go over the top and doesn't fall into any of the vacation facial expressions for laughs. All of the characters are quirky. A nice fish out of water story where the lead character finds out he's much more out of his element than he expects."
4,Chevy's Best Movie,"I'm not a Chevy Chase fan, but this is one of my favorite movies! I can't understand the one-star reviews (obviously bored teenagers with no imagination looking for an ""Animal House""-type movie). The last 20 minutes are classic!"
3,Spelt Which Way??!!?,"God help me, I live in Cincinnati, Ohio, one of the most...interesting...lively...ahh, places, ah, in the nation. Not much goin' on here...The Stiff box contains the original version of what they spell as ""Cincinatti Fatback."" Great song. Reviews below say that the version here ain't the same one as appears on the box.Question: is this the correct spelling of the song title, or is the Stiff box correct. In other words, is it right to spell it wrong or right to spell it right? Get me?Wonder if anyone has lobbied for this tune to be the official city song?"
4,An Eye-Opening Account,"My view of the homeless people I encounter will change as a result of reading Stringer's tale, and I suppose shattering the ignorant, apathetic, uninformed myths I believed is reason enough to read it. Stringer forces the reader to view the homeless as real people, with pasts and stories to tell and reasons for being in their predicament. He is sharp and creative in his attempts to stay fed, clothed and sheltered. He must be. He shows hope, which I once believed many homeless men and women to be without. He describes the homeless as people desperately trying to be alone, which is one of those nuggets that makes you put the book down and really think it through. Bravo to Stringer for not only showing the world what he has been through and overcome, but for doing it eloquently and firmly. My only real criticism of the book is its length (or lack thereof). For twenty bucks, I'm expecting smaller type, smaller leading and, in general, more."
3,Insightful but romanticized!,"The author is definitely a writer that hasn't missed his calling! However, his treatment of this topic tends to romanticize it and create a ""fantasy"" of the harsh reality. This may make the topic of homelessness and life on the street more palpable to readers and so serve a valuable purpose."
3,"Great writing, rushed story.","I was surprised when I bought this book to see how thin it was. But I was enthusiastic nonetheless and set out to read it. As I finished it, I sat there questioning what just happened. Mr. Stringer is a wonderful writer, I will give him that. But this, his first novel, seems rushed and underdeveloped. I bought this book in the hopes of finding out how he changed his situation for the better. The only explanation we get is that he started writing. Well, that information is in reviews and overviews of the book, so what else is learned from reading Grand Central Winter that isn't foreshadowed in the synopsis?I am still glad that I read this book. It gave me insight into an issue that is often overlooked or discarded as not important or easier to pretend it doesn't exist. I commend Mr. Stringer for his strength and I look forward to hearing what he has to say next. He has the raw potential of being a strong new voice in the literary world."
1,STINKS!! AND STINKS SOME MORE!!!!,"No season play, no uniforms, HHOORRIIBBBLLE GRAFIX... you can barely do anything @ all. *********WARNING:********* DONT BUY THIS STUPID GAME!!!! EVERYBODY LOOKS THE SAME - A BUNCH OF CLONES!!!"
3,This album is mostly for long-time Fairport enthusiasts,"This album has come out in a few different versions. I have the one previous to this; two additional songs have been added since then. The album captures the ""Full House"" lineup--the hardest-rocking of the many Fairport lineups--during a 1970 stand at the Troubador in Los Angeles. There are some good moments, but if you're looking for a live Fairport album, ""Encore, Encore"" and ""The Cropredy Box"" are far superior. The take on ""Staines Morris"" is a highlight. If you're already a big Fairport fan, you will find something to enjoy here, but if you're new to Fairport, this isn't where you should start.(1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal)"
4,They really are still here!,"I cannot believe that this group is still around. Back in my teen years (early eighties) I found the band 'Nighmares in Wax' who later turned into 'Dead or Alive', I brought every release up until the Album 'Nude' and then never heard from them again as I had lived and worked abroad.Since visiting Amazon I have found that the band are much more Alive than Dead and have invested in new CD formats of their stuff!, this remixed version of YSMR has brought back a lot of happy memories from my teen days.I await eagerly for my delivery of Dead or Alive's 'Fragile'and older material which i ordered yesterday from Amazon."
5,Borneo Horns with Lenny Pickett,"My man Lenny,Right on. That is an unbeliveable example of music know how. I really enjoyed it. I only wish that I could play as well as he does. It took me a long time to find this album and I won't let it get away from me.Best wishes to Lenny Pickett and the Saturday Night Band, you guys are the best!Dominick DOnofrio"
2,to each is own i guess,i for one couldn't stand this album. the vocals sound cartoonish. the riffs are dull. the songwriting overall lacks creativity and passion. the whole album comes across as very safe and sterile. about as vicious as a wet noodle.
3,"Great product, but not very sturdy","My daughter and I loved this product. We would have people walking down the street stop and ask where I purchased it. Because I have to take the stroller in and out of my truck and I didn't want to remove the toy tray every time, some of the bottle holders broke off. Eventually I had to throw it away."
1,"Sparkler, no.. Greaser, yes!","Sorry, but I was told the smell was great and it does smell good, but my goodness, just use a little bit, otherwise you'll have a greasy mop!"
2,WOW! WAS I DISAPPOINTED!,"I downloaded 'Trying to Make a Fool of Me', their 1969 hit. It's not the original version, and it's really poor quality. I love the Delfonics, but hate this version! Sorry."
5,Italo Disco does not get better than this!,"Ken Laszlo had some popular hits a few of which you can find on Amazon mp3 as remixes, but these where not the songs often played our heard back in the days of folded over and tapered pants. In my opinion the whole album is great but Don't Cry and Tonight are probably the best."
3,not original recordings,"""Hey Hey Guy"" is not the original version that I remember with the phone call at the beginning...none of that...it has a whole different feel. So because of that I have to take 2 stars off because that is my favorite song by him. The rest of the songs I am not as familiar with and so the updated sound (louder and more bass) are not as annoying. In fact, some of them sound pretty good."
3,Wolf Earrings,The only thing I was disappointed in the earrings is the size. I thought they might be a little bigger. I love the details in the earrings. I would highly recommend this seller to anyone who loves wolf jewelry like I do.
5,terrrific value at terrific price,We use multiple Magnums and finding a source of parts with great prices and very timely service is just what we wanted. We will ot hesitate to use this source again.
5,fast delivery,I can't believe how fast and fresh the chilli was when I opened it. And I live in the boonies. I would definitely order from them again!
4,Mild taste. 3 of the 6 bottles leaked in the box making a huge mess.,"I have really enjoyed Hoisin sauce for years. There is a tremendous difference in the taste of various brands. Some have almost no 'Hoisin flavor' and some have a lot. Some are spicy and some not. To me this is non-spicy, which I like because I do not tolerate spicy (hot) foods. The 'Hoisin flavor' is mild. It tastes like sweet and sour sauce with some added 'Hoisin flavor'. I like it but wish the 'Hoisin flavor' was stronger.I first ordered the 3 smaller bottles and they arrived fine. 3 of the 6 larger bottles leaked in the box and made a big mess."
4,Ultravox - The Island Years,"Finally, most of the John Foxx-era Ultravox tunes are available on one CD. The Island Years features all the great, long-unavailable early tunes."
1,Don't waste your money,"This book is worthless, it conveys little information and is horribly organized and jumps all over the place. I bought this as an e book for my Kindle, and all the diagrams are too small to read. The pictures are unclear, small and useless. The type looks like it was written on a typewriter."
3,"This one is ok, but their first two are better.","Yes, of course, the Why Store has an amazing energy. They are a fabulous band. I have seen them play numerous times over the last four years, and indeed, they get better every time. Yet one thing that is not conveyed on Two Beasts is their energy. The original versions of When You're High and Everybody are much better than these new polished versions. Where is the energy? Where is the powerful bass and drums? And what's with the keyboard. Listen to the first two Why Store Cd's, and then listen to Two beasts. You'll know what I mean."
3,A good sampling of English music,"Although the selected English literature is an excellent sampling of the English choral tradition, it does not do the literature justice; the reason for it being so may be, in part, due to the recording methods that were employed for this particular album, or it may be simply the quality of the performance. Nevertheless, the choral performance on this album is satisfactory, but it is a very unbalanced group, tending to be heavy on the higher side of the ensemble. The lower parts are often drowned out by the overwhelming treble sound. Aside from these things, the recording is one that any person seeking to sample choral literature should consider."
3,"Just ok, but good extras","This DVD was good, but could have been better. I did enjoy the visuals. The music is mostly Drum-n-bass, which is ok, but not really my style. Putting the DJ intreviews in the DVD was a nice bonus. I hope this studio will do more of that with there future releses.My rating sys-5*=best,4*=Great,3*=Good,2*=Just ok,1*=Run away"
4,Worth The Wait,"Disney has at last released one of its Classics.I enjoyed this movie as a child at the moviehouse. And it took me a long time as an adult to locate the video....all be it with the video editors cuts !!. But this dvd version restores the complete movie. As with dvd , the photography is truly excellent. And the sound track with the restored songs just great.The Portobello Rd scene sticks out in this respect. A movie I look forward to sitting down with my Kids to watch"
5,As described by seller,The movie was in good condition. It shipped on time. I could not ask for a better transaction.
4,Fun fun fun!,"I watched this for the first time the other day. It was pure fun. Such a great movie, felt like a wonderful escape from the real world. Funny, enjoyable and so original. I loved it, I can't believe I had never watched it!"
4,good,"product arrived timely, and was as described. i would definitely order from this seller again. great classic disney movie, probably recommend for younger ages...not as good as i remember as a child and it seemed to drag on"
1,Possibly the Worst Disney Film not to be a sequel,"This Film has little in the way of a plot the acting is bad, the animation is bad, this film is TERRIBLE! I sat through this peice of shit simply because I'm a Disney fan and thought I should see all of there no sequel movies. It wasn't worth it. Don't waste your money!"
4,Great!,"This DVD was shipped timely and received in good condition. The quality of the picture is very good, but the sound quality is a little low, despite turning up the volume. I figured this is so because it is an old film. All in all, you will not be disappointed with your purchase. Great vendor, great movie... a fantastic purchase!"
3,Dubbing & Subtitle Problems,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!Problems with this remake:--Several of Prof. Browne's dialog bits are not in-sync.--Only some of the German was subtitled. I definitely remember more.
5,Teaches the right form!,"I learned to use chopsticks as a young child, because my parents loved to go out for Chinese Food. My mom had these little brackets with rubber bands (it was the 70s) that worked fine, but now as a mom, I know they were probably a pain. I got the combi sticks for my 4year old son, who loves them. The palm nub teaches the right form for using chopsticks alone- which he can do a little now. Eating with chopsticks is like holding a pen still and wiggling another pen back and forth next to it. This is what these sticks mimic. Unlike the one piece pinching sticks I've seen for kids. I'm ordering some more to keep in the car for last minute trips for Japanese!"
2,Don't bother with this one.,"This slim volumn of large print (I'm sure in order to expand the page count) was an easy read, I finished it in less than an hour. It probably took a little longer to write. The author is a journalist and he wrote it like an opinion piece. I learned nothing new and consider it a waste of time. Certainly not worth the price."
2,Not as good as I remember,I heard the last track on this CD on Aural Moon Progressive Radio. I really liked it so I ordered the CD as soon as that song finished playing. The rest of the CD however is a bit shaky. Not a real fave. Track 4 was worth multiple plays but that's about it. The physical quality of the product was adequate - no scuffs or scratches that might have hampered its play. I really liked Billy's collaboration with Chris Squire and thought this might be an extension of that sound and there were similarities but overall it was a hard listen.
4,Amazing!!,This autobiography is full of the most amazing stories from the first western person to permantely live with the Inupiat Eskimos of Alaskas North Slope. A worth while read for some great real life adventure.
3,Laptop a little disapointed,"I recently purchased a compaq laptop and the unit itself was fine, but all the extras that came on the laptop has giving me a lot of problems. I believe there is a software confliction especially with Vonage. Vonage took forever to delete because it is scattered across many files. I don't even know if it is still gone. The worst problem is the laptop will not turn off with shutdown. When shutting down it automatically restarts. I beleive this to be associated with the software conflictions. Other than that it is a great laptop for the money. Very lightweight and easy to use!"
2,I wish they'd start packaging them separately again!,"This product works fine; the problem is the way they market it. You used to be able to buy the wheels and the fluid separately. However, this package is like bundling a pack of 10 hot dogs with 8 rolls, and forcing you to buy them together, always. At least before you could buy an extra wheel or two before if you had fluid leftover; now I've accumulated tons of fluid that's just going to go to waste, because I can't buy the wheels separately any longer. A way to waste money buy putting it into the manufacturer's product for no good reason. C'mon DI; let us buy the accessories separately again!!!"
4,Ferret and Lapis pendant,"THe product arrived looking identical to the advertisement. The silver was substantial and well detailed, the lapis was of good color and consistent markings. Great for anyone who has a ferret, or a fondness for minks, weasels and similar creatures."
5,Addendum to previous review,"Just an update here for anyone who may want to buy a copy of this terrific album. It turns out that a remastered, slipcased edition is now available from Fledgling Records in the UK. They may be releasing it through license with Island, but at any rate the CD is available for pre-order NOW at amazon.co.uk! Your regular amazon.com info will transfer over when you log into the site, so ordering a new and superior copy of ""Human Fly"" will be a breeze. It comes out on July 5, so pre-order your copy today, and definitely don't buy an overpriced used copy of the disc."
5,Excellent!,This book helps you pick apart and interpret the Jpanese sentences better! I don't know what I would have done without it! It's really easy to understand and goes into great detail to help you learn1 I highly reccomend!
2,Least interesting Marillion album.,"Of all their albums, this one I find least interesting. Not only does the band now seem to have run out of ideas completely, but the sound is a mess, too. -Or rather, the mix. Hogarth's vocals, as great as they are, dominates the picture, almost drowning the music. Like with the previous release, ""Brave"", trying to be Pink Floyd doesn't suit them; some faster songs would've.(And a better album front cover.)"
4,"Slinky, soulful and funky","As a long-time fan of ""Brand New Heavies"" I thought I would give this album a try, and I was not disappointed. The album is not only a showcase of N'Dea Davenport's vocal skills, but a pleasing combination of styles that flow smoothly from tune to tune. There is a whole range of jazzy, funky song styling that is lacking in so many R&B performers these days. The lyrics are fine, but it is N'Dea's harmonizing on top of the soulful beats that makes this an album to add to your collection. A bit of acid jazz, a smattering of Drums & Bass, and a whole lot of soul."
3,Not This Time,"Her voice is as great as ever on this one, but the material isn't nearly as strong as her first two releases. Most of it falls somewhere between country & soft rock, & she completely abandons the bluegrass elements that spiced up her previous albums. By far the two best tracks are the uplifting, up-tempo ""We Must Be Thinking Alike"", & ""A Great Disguise""."
2,Full of Generalizations,"Though the book certainly had some pertinent points, such as fathers deserving equal consideration in child custody cases, it is full of facts which are not backed up by data. For example, Farrell states that 73% of male murderers come from single mother families. He, therefore, concludes that the mothers are responsible for their sons becoming murderers. He never states why the mothers are single parents, which is pertinent to the argument he tries to make. Are the mothers single because the fathers were abusive or criminal?? If so, it is pertinent information. The book is full of this type of generalization, and therefore must be read with an open mind to alternative explationations for the statistics quoted."
1,Not a good buy,I received the mask but no filters.I am disappointed that I can not get the filters and that my only option is to return the mask.Definitely not good buy or good options for a resolution.
2,Not a good cd single,"The remixes are terrible, the only good song is the album version & video. The remixes don't even come close to the album version its to dancey. So don't waste your money unless you want the video its the same one they show on tv"
2,Didn't Hold Up,"I knew this was a cheaper version of 'The Rabbit', but I still expected it to last a bit longer than it did. After about 25 uses, the corkscrew no longer works, although I sitll have a fantastic bottle stopper and drip ring. This product is not recommended."
3,Disappointed!,"I got this CD because I wanted the song ""Touch the Rainbow"". I thought it would be Studio cut, rather it was live. In addition the sound quality was poor. :(. I like the band though. I would not recommend this CD because the sound quality is not good as most live performances are."
5,JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR SHOULD ORDER-FOR HIMSELF!,"THIS BOOK IS FABULOUS, A MUST READ FOR MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND PERSONNEL. DESMOND UNDERSTANDS PATIENTS' NEEDS AND FEARS ONLY TOO WELL AND PASSES THE INFORMATION ON CLEARLY AND CONCISELY. I RECOMMEND IT FOR PROSPECTIVE PATIENTS (MOST OF US) SO THEY WILL BE ALERT FOR POSSIBLE PROBLEMS AND MISCOMMUNICATION. BRAVO TO THE AUTHORS!"
4,These Colors Won't Run: A Veteran Tribute,I was pleased with the selection on this CD. What more can be said...God Bless the U.S.A. The freedom we have is taken for granted and abused. There are men and women out there standing for the defense of this freedom and making sacrifices. It is time they are honored as well as the families that stand behind them and support them.
3,Three are re-recordings made in the 50's - Not as Good!,"I'm a younger Andrews Sisters fan. I was first turned onto them when I heard ""Rum and Coca Cola"" - did I want to hear more after that! This is NOT the great version I heard!!! In the 50's they re-recorded their hits for Capitol and 3 of them are here - Rum and Coca Cola, I'll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time, and Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy (the rest, however are originals, Begin the Beguine is super.) You've never heard these songs until you've heard the originals. I'd stay away from Captiol CD's or compilation CD's which include Capitol re-recordings of the Andrews like this one. I also bought and recommend ""The Andrews Sisters - Their All-Time Greated Hits"" (MCA/Decca) - sold here at Amazon too - it is packed with all original versions and has really great liner notes. The original Rum & Coca Cola and Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy are pure magic!"
2,These are not the originals - Capitol re-recordings,The below review was supposed to go with another CD. NONE of the ones on this CD are the originals!
4,Rick Derringer Guitars And Women,"This bloke is an unsung hero. A guitar virtuoso, I heard 'All American Boy', Ricks first solo album, and was hooked. Great songs, a great cast of musicians, and a brilliant album. This one, Guitars And Women, is equally as good as his first. Once again the band is solid, 'Something Warm' is one of those HIDDEN GEMS, and Ricks remake of 'Don't Ever Say Goodbye' outdoes the original by a mile. It's a shame that this bloke never made it in the MAINSTREAM big time, like he deserved, but I take a certain pride in introducing friends to a little known musician who made some great albums back in the 70s and was a fantastic AXEMAN."
3,a classic for any Rick Derringer fan,"Some really good songs, some fluff.If you like Derringer, you'll like this album. Some songs were written by Rick Neilson from Cheap Trick. Derringer fans have been waiting for this to come out on CD for a long time."
3,Have Gun Will Travel,"Thank you for prompt delivery big problem DVD wont play on our Samsung machine here in Australia on the bottom of box you have written for playing in America and Canada wont play in Australia. Do you have disc made to play in Australia if so I would like this matter cleared up, before I will consider buying any further series of Have Gun will Travel. Sincerely Walter Beal.PS Hope to hear from you soon."
5,Have Gun - Will Travel,Great Paladin flick. Brings the early days of adult westerns to life. Have Gun - Will Travel will take you back to the early San Francisco barbary coast westerns. Richard Boone has a style and poise that are extremely realistic. Takes you back to yeaster year. Great pick.
1,Have Gun Will Travel - The Complete First Season,Its been over two weeks and I still haven't received this order or an email saying why!
3,Pikaru's review,The recording needs a lot of improvement. There were some episodes that were not viewable. I suggest that the master be remastered and try again. I still like the item and can't wait to get the last 3 seasons of the series.
4,Get wired,"Fans of intelligent Westerns shouldn't miss Paramount's resurrection of ""Have Gun Will Travel."" The show, which ran on CBS for five seasons beginning in the fall of 1957, starred Richard Boone as Paladin, a badass do-gooder who ran his one-man mercenary business out of a San Francisco hotel.Unlike most TV Westerns of its time, ""Have Gun"" still plays wonderfully thanks in large part to its savvy scripts. Quite a few were written by Gene Roddenberry, exploring some of the social themes he continued with on ""Star Trek."" Boone looks great, fashion-forward in all black -- hip, intelligent, deadly. Bernard Hermann contributed the swelling music.The six-disc Paramount set has all 39(!) episodes from the first season of ""Have Gun,"" with guest stars including Jack Lord, Charles Bronson, John Carradine and Warren Oates.The black-and-white images look OK but can be distractingly dark. Audio is undercut by a fair amount of hiss and boom."
4,Still Some Uncollected Gary Cooper Out There!!!,"Always glad to see some new films being released by major stars. I had no idea a film had even been made of Peter Ibbetson, let alone with a major star in it. I'd like to see two of my favorite Gary Cooper films come out on DVD: The Fountainhead and Bright Leaf. Both have sultry co-stars--Patricia Neal and Lauren Bacall, respectively. The Fountainhead can be found on VHS for a rather high price, and I don't think Bright Leaf ever even made it to VHS, to my knowledge. It was an excellent film, with Cooper playing a tobacco plantation magnate whose greed and bitterness takes over everything in his life. I can only hope that someday we'll see these two gems in a nice DVD release. Yup!!!Addendum: The Fountainhead has subsequently been released on DVD, but still waiting for Bright Leaf as of 7/08!"
3,my review,I tried this product once. I did it by myself but I don't see any difference from the way it was before. I have short curly hair. I was nervous using it so I probably didn't use enough of the product in my hair because I had a lot left over. I may give it a try again later.
5,Sounds Awesome!,This product sounds really cool! I wish to get it soon and i think i will really enjoy it. I am a big fan of nintendo products so i am really excited about this one.
1,"Books Are Good, Practice Exams are Utterly Error-Riddled.",Read the books: they're easy to read and explanatory.If you're hoping on practice exams buy from another publisher. The ones provided my Measure Up are full of errors. The font size they use is tiny and not resizeable.When asked about the errata for the practice exam I was told by Measure Up to just look up microsoft kb articles to check the validity of the answer -- when I said I shouldn't need to look up the questions to be able to trust their validity the customer service agent basically told me I'd only need to do that if I was knowledgeable.I'd really stay away from this if you want it for the practice exams.
4,Well worth the money!,"Having been in the industry for several years, most IT books are dry, boring, sleep reading. The layout in this set is easy to read and comprehend. The examples are practical and useful. Only drawback to this series is the explanation of the pictorial network configuration errors."
4,strainer pot,"This pot is very convenient to have as i have several friends that drink tea and it is perfect for that purpose. Of course it is great for all the other drain/water off products too, in small quantities. The only thing that i can find wrong is that a water type of mark stays at the bottom of the pot .... sort of a rainbow type stain..thought it might be from the boiling of hard water. The rest of the pot remains with the highly polished look //// good for the money...........Gail Napolitano"
4,Christmas Glory,"It's just great to have that deep, rich voice floating around a house during Christmas. This CD is perfect to play during Christmas dinner!"
5,The Legend And The Holiday Songs,"There is no doubt that Frank Sinatra is a legend. Every selection in his recording of ""A Jolly Christmas from Frank Sinatra"" recorded in a solemn and traditional way, makes you feel the real Christmas spirit. This is the first time I ever owned this CD, but I've heard the songs from an old record many times before. This CD is a classic and definitely my favorite of all Christmas songs ever recorded."
5,Wonderful book.,"This book is very enlightening and worth study, I would recommend it. I think that Every library should have it."
4,Tracey can sing!,"Fun album. I never cared much for Tracey's comedy or her show, but, man, can she sing! Who knew? (Well, I guess a lot of people did by now!) The song that enticed me to buy this album was 'They Don't Know.' It's great."
5,6GRADERS DATING THROUGH A NEWSPAPER? COOOOOOOOL!,IT'S THE COOOOOLEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ. IT'S FUNNY THE WAY JANET GETS WINSTON (OR WAS IT LILA WHO GOT WINSTON?)& JESSICA GETS AARON. FIRST SHE FIGHHT WITH HIM & THEN SHE GETS HIM AS HER DATE. ISN'T IT AWESOME?! I JUST LOOVE THIS BOOK! I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR AAAALL SWEET VALLEY FANS. THOSE OF YOU WHO'RE CRAAAAAZY ABOUT SWEET VALLEY CAN CONTACT ME AT THE ABOVE ADDRESS.
4,Arrived quickly but case looks cheap.,The product looks great and arrived quickly. I personally don't care what the case looks like but it did look kind of cheap.
2,The Greatest Hits is not so great.,"To begin with, the song ""The Very Thought of You"", one of his most beautiful songs, is not even included. Then, ""Nature Boy"" is not the stereo version, but a 1940's mono version in inferior sound. The whole cd is badly produced. After I bought this cd and found it sadly lacking, I purchased the cd titled ""Unforgettable Nat King Cole"" (on Capitol,released 2000). It has all of the great hits in stereo and in perfect sound. It should receive the 5 star rating. Why people should rate the ""Greatest Hits"" album 5 stars is beyond me. It should get at most 2 stars. I'm sorry I was snookered into buying it. I can always use it as a coffee coaster."
5,My First Taste Of Mr. Cole,"This was my first Nat King Cole CD. I am only 18, and most guys my age listen to rap (as do I) or rock. This is such a healthy departure. His gentle voice seems so comforting. Songs like ""You Call it Madness..."" and ""Mona Lisa"" almost always remain in my mind. This CD is not only great to listen to, but it opened me up to Cole's other work. Great Collection."
4,The star of this movie is the car...,"Yeah, that luscious maroon roadster that purrs along the back roads of the atomic testing ground we now know as Dreamland is the real babe in this picture. Everyone seems to whine about the heavy handed plot, but am I the only one who appreciated Chaz Palminteri's masterful death scene, the subtlety that Michael Madsen (yes, Madsen) brought to his role, and the absolutely fabulous, pull-out-all-the-stops scene where Melanie Griffith discovers her husband has cheated on her? Anyone who overlooked Griffith's performance in this movie was out buying popcorn. Sure, there are some slow moments here, but it still remains a highly watchable, entertaining movie."
5,FANTASTIC,Great movie! Well done! Takes you back to a time and feeling of old Los Angeles and its beginnings. Well worth the money!
2,Too advanced for kids,"The best knitting and crocheting instructional books I've found for children (ages 7 and up) are the ones published by Klutz, complete with detailed colorful drawings and close-up photographs of each step. This book is a nice idea, but missed the mark in my opinion. Also, the patterns provided aren't really what most kids would be interested in making. Unless your target audience is NOT a beginner, this book will likely fail to spark an interest."
3,Wonderful acting,"Once a classic always a classic; if you ponder on this you might get explanations why new inventions on improving vehicle mileage, alternative energy devices have been suppressed by the powers that be."
5,perfect size sinks - feel and look high end,used 2 of these for a bathroom remodel. The bathroom was fairly small so we decided to expand it by taking some space from a nearby closet and add a small 2 sink vanity. These sinks were the perfect size and looked gorgeous mounted under a carrara marble slab. 5 stars!
4,Thunder Cats:Spitting Image Vol 3,"I love the thunder cats!! I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it only has one episode instead of two. In this Episode: ""Panthro is spreading destruction across Third Earth. Good ol' Panthro?!? Well, it's not really him... but a deadly clone Mumm-Ra has created. But where's the real McCoy? Trapped in the Bottomless Chasm, Panthro soon has to face ""himself"" in a battle to the death!"" I highly recommend you buy this video and others if you can. They're only out on VHS and are really hard to find."
3,What is the name of that song????,"Does anyone know the name of the song that is playing when Josie is remembering the time she was going to the prom and Billy throws eggs at her. Some of the lyrics are...""In the midnight hour, I can feel your power. I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there..."""
4,what is that song?,"funky song played when josie walks thru the halls all perky, everyone is calling her a loser cuz the ink from her stamp got on her forehead and it reads ""loser"". the lyrics to that song go something like ""mirror mirror on the wall.."" does anyone know what the song is called or who it's by????"
3,Re : Song Playing At Prom,The song that pays when the Aldys and the denominators arrive at the prom in their double helix costumes isRiot Nrrrd by 2 Skinnee Js
3,What Is that Song?!,"Hey! I can't figure out what the name of the song is that is playing at the dance! It's a slow song and the only part I know is the part that goes ""mmm mmmm"". It's been reallying bugging me I can't think of it. Can someone help me out?? Thanks!"
4,the wrong song given to us.. but a great movie and MU,"First of all, the song by the Cardigans isn't ""Easy/ Rewind"" it is ERASE/REWIND.. Now, I don't know about you but I absolutely loved the movie!It made me laugh, cry, it even got me happy and sad! And I just love all the teeny bopper movies.. I think that the Cardigan song is the best song on here because it was the best part of the movie, at the prom, and they played this song!I think you should really get this movie on DVD! I cant wait to own it and see the Deleted Scenes if they have them! Get this Soundtrack!"
4,Kate and Anna McGarrigle,Beautiful songs sung with intricate harmonies. Had not heard them for many years and was delighted to come across them again.
5,perfect debut,"The sophistocation of this record belies the fact that it was the soon to famous sisters debut album. For years I have listed to this record and never tired of its singing and songs. Misleading to call it folk because at its outer edges it is dressed up and ready to go to town pop, while at its core its lovingly, over the top sentimentality of the sweetest kind. From the opening headiness of Kiss and Say Goodbye to the closing, sing a along Gospel bonanza of Travelling on for Jesus, this record never pushes the same buttons twice yet it all hangs together in a way that I don' t think any of the McGarrigles other albums have quite managed. Hard to catergorise as some of the best and most original music is, this is a record which is as fresh and tangy as ever."
4,sisters in harmony,"This is the sister's oldest album and it is one of their best. Without complex instrumental backing, the emphasis is on the lyrics and the simple melodies. The lyrics range from humourous to melancholy and the harmonies (as always) are magical. The cafe stlye music of this albums sets an idle background for the sister's unusual voices, displaying them to their best advantage."
2,Third prize in the Creative Writing Class,"An earnest effort but if you want good, cliché free writing, engaging and well drawn characters and an interesting plot line you'll need to avoid this little oddity. Okay if you're on holiday in another country and it's the only book available in English."
1,Scam,I want a refund. This product is a scam. You do not get any product you wanted. You do not get anything of value.
2,swimming pool,"It was easy to set up and fill. The problem was that my pump did not fit the pool. My pump and filter is for a 12' by 48"". This pool was 12', 36"". The height difference made the pump incompatible. I gave the pool to a friend. I hope that he gets some use out of it, and I hope he was able to purchase the proper pump and filter."
2,Would not recommend,Wasn't what I expected. Within less than a month of purchase the water drained out of the pool. The sides were not very strong.
3,Good!,Magic Mozart is another of the Mozart Effect tapes. I think I now own them all. It is done as well as any off-the-net Mozart classical CDs available for a few dollars less. It is a nice addition for variety sake.
1,A guide to joining a cult and to throwing away your identity,"This book seemed a little to ""fly by night"" when reading it. When I took a class with Charna Halpern she couldn't stop quoting it. It made me sick. It seems that Truth in Comedy preps you to join her cult of young actors that think they will be discovered at her ImprovOlympic, which seems to actually be losing money by the year. How can one make brave moves in improv if they're constantly talked down to, in print and in person?"
4,just an old fan,"ive had starlancer for many years,i love it. i just wish freelancer was up to specs with it. i also wish there were more addons and/updates on another note starlancer will run on vista ultimate 32 bit but it wont run on 7 64 bit. i dont know what happened to the space sim market(may still be there,just no action from the programers)but i sure wish it would return"
4,I just loved,"I saw the movie few days ago and remembered the soundtrack.. man, it's just so cool, actually it's the perfect music for the kind of movie that it is.. I really recommended if you like rock"
4,"Cat loves it, and keeps skin nice!","One of our cats has a tonne of dandruff. Had, I should say. We switched from Science Diet for skin to the Royal Canin, and her dandruff isn't completely gone, but it's definitely better! Plus, she finds it to be YUMMY :)"
5,Hiliarious,"I dont usually watch the blue comedy tour or any comedy station for that matter but a friend gave me a cd of bill engvall and i cracked up....this guy is hilarious! So it was no surprise when i went to the store, saw this dvd, and immedialtly bought it. If you love comedy you'll love Bill engvall, he's smart talking and his jokes are side splitting...you cant resist him. One thing dissapointing tho is that this disk doesnt contain any extra features besides a still gallery which isnt all that good, but it does contain 72 minutes of comedy fun you'll be sure to enjoy. Buy this disk, you wont be left wonting."
2,Title misleading,"We thought we would hear more of Bill's well known ""here's your sign"" routine - what you get in this DVD is some stand up routines with the last 5 minutes or so ""mentioning"" the ""here's your sign"" lines ... very dissapointing. Would not recomend to those looking to here his well know routines."
4,"Great movie, bad director's commentary","I saw this again after many years and it struck me again how powerful it is: an amazing movie, particularly considering that it was the debut of 26-year-old writer/director Steven Soderbergh. The cast is fantastic. I'd forgotten Laura San Giacomo is actually a very good actress, and James Spader is simply brilliant as the outsider who brings his sex videos into a rather dysfunctional family -- and changes the group's lives.The only disappointing aspect of the DVD is not the movie itself, but the director's commentary. I'm sure Soderbergh had fun chatting with Neil LaBute, but they often talk about everything but the movie, and it can be quite frustrating."
5,fascinating,some of the most mesmerizing dialogue in movie history-also see teewillers review near this one-what a marvelous writer and review this is-you ought to do this for a living-the people who do this for the la times arent nearly this good
3,no longer ground-breaking,"In 1989, this movie might've been way ahead of its time, but in 2009. the film hardly stands out among movies dealing with relationship crisis. The movie has good. solid performances from the cast, particularly Andie MacDowell, but no one performance is extraordinary."
5,From Movie Stars to TV Stars,I saw this movie years ago and forgot about it. I fially found it on Showtime On Demand Saturday May 14th 2005. It is amazing these people went from this sexual film noir to eventually do streamlined tv programs. James Spader now does Boston Legal. Peter Gallagher does the OC. Andie macDowell does lots of tv especially the Hallmark Movie with Rose Odonnell. And the San Giacomo chick has done sitcoms. I find the whole thing amazing!!
3,interesting movie,"When I saw this the first time, I had really liked it. So I purchased it. Seeing it the second time I was not that impressed."
1,"Psychology 101 - A limpid, uninspiring, facile flick.","I have endured this movie many times, each time straining to eek out some enjoyment or interest. Each time failing and wondering more and more what the big deal is. The story is child-like in its conception and I understand why it took Mr. Schoderberg so few days to write. I can only compare this film to Flatliners in its inability to produce a coherent and stimulating script. To those who loved the film, I suggest they get out more and even read a few books. 'My secret Garden' by Nancy Friday would a better start than this woeful effort."
4,Wicked Book,"Flight 116 is a totally wicked book! Caroline B. Cooney, author of many great books, describes the charaters and the settings. She puts you in that action. All of her books are great, but this one is probably the best out of all I have read!Flight 116 is about a 13 year old girl who trys to save lives after a plane crashed on the family's property she trys to save as many people as she can before the plane explodes. How many lives will she save, or will she lose her life to save somebody else? You will just have to read the book to find out!"
1,flight #116 is down,I don't think this book is that good because all of the book you know there is going to be a plain crash and when it happends it is no big dell.Then you know just like any outher bad book the to mane people fall in love.This book was a big wast of my time it was so boring I wanted to burn the book.If it wasen't for a grade i would have through the book away after the first page.
4,A great surf movie,"Beautiful surfing scenes. but there's one default : only spanish subtitles available, it's a real shame"
3,It missed the mark... just another 5 Love Language Books,"The back of the book makes it sound like a good book... but after inspection inside, it really missed the mark.While people may be looking for one type of Apology, we should not direct our Apology to that type, but we should be using ALL 5! A true apology should require and entail ALL 5 of them!That is why this book missed the mark... it based it upon the 5 Love Language which says to hit their language of the person you are trying to love...But to do so with Apology, we are really trying to get off the hook from being truely repentful which would require ALL of the steps, not just one of them!"
3,OK Book,Some good stuff but some of it is psycho-babble that only exists in the minds of the authors.
5,one of my all time favorite albums,"I love this album so much that when I went to live in France and didn't bring any music, I was forced to go out and purchase a copy in France for about four times the price I paid at home. Today I own yet another copy on CD, and when I listen to it, it sounds as fresh and authentic as it did the very first time I heard it almost thirty years ago. Amazing talent--also true of their ""French Record"" and self-titled album. And of course, with time they've also provided for our future, by giving us Rufus Wainwright, whose music is as astonishing in its own unique way as was the McGarrigles. BUY THIS ALBUM--I've never played it for anyone who didn't LOVE it--I can't imagine a regret!!"
2,Okay toy but not as good as it looks,"Seems like a good idea, but pricey for what it is. The string is not long enough. I know you have to worry these days about safety, and everyone is out to protect children and all that, but that means sometimes toys are just impractical. Make the string a few inches longer so you can actually hold the magnetic pen properly and you can actually reach all parts of the toy !The carved out wooden channels are also too wide and you can almost move two balls through them at once.My 2-yr old tires quickly as he quickly figures out puzzles - this one was just boring to him."
2,Better weights available.,"The swing sock--like other golf club weights--is used to smooth your swing and help make it more accurate.Unfortunately, the sock will only fit on regular irons--not on drivers or hybrids. Because it only fits on the head, you do not have the flexibility to put the weight on different parts of your club for a variety of exercises.It works for what it does--adds weight to the club head of some clubs. However, there are other products that can do that and also fit on all your clubs and put the weight in various spots for warming up and improving smoothness and accuracy. The extra price is worth it for the flexibility and usefulness that you don't get with the Swing Sock."
2,Hit&Miss Album,i was hyped with the Debut Album from AudioSlave. Chris Cornell vocally is still on point. Always have dug Cornell since the Soundgarden days. Tom Morello strong Guitar player as well.but this album is very middle of the road. it sounds like they are just going through the motions at this point. it's just a ok Album on a whole. nothing really stands out to me.
1,My revelation: Audioslave's Revelations dissapointing,"Ahh Audioslave. Chris Cornell, former members of Rage Against the Machine, over the top vocals, guitar driven anthems, relentless bass, foot stomping drums. What's not to love? That is until Revelations. On this album, it seems like Audioslave abandons everything that makes them the awesomeness that is Audioslave in favor of songs that are less than stellar and not even memorable. What's worse is that Cornell's ""I hate the President"" attitude blatantly rears its ugly face. You know what Cornell? If you dislike George W. that's your right as an American. But putting in your lyrics really makes lousy music."
5,It still sounds like Rage,"I do indeed like Rage and Tom morello, so this album makes a great album for anyone that enjoys the talent of Rage as much as I do!! Chris Cornell is a great addition to the band, too bad they split up. It does sound a little poppish sometimes, but it is really enjoyable!!"
3,Ok,Audioslave has a good sound but this is their weakest album so far. It may just be that they over extended themselves in their quest to produce a new album every year. Take some time guys and wait for the good stuff to congeal.
5,IGNORE THE EDITORIAL REVIEW,"This album is great! No ballads fall ""painfully Short"" as the editorial review states! It is a funky rock album with so many great songs. Audioslave delivers meaningful lyrics, awesome guitars,and a driving percussion- the more you listen, the more you'll love. Too hard to pick favorites, but from the first song, revelations to the last song, Moth- you will enjoy this. Each Audioslave album has been different from the last- if you appreciate lyrics,and songs with meaning along with a great band to back them up -thats what you get! Buy this now!"
5,This movie rules!,"I loved this flick, even though it was done before in the Naked Gun Movies, Loaded Weapon has it's moments also, with a slew of cameos, and the hilarious leads, this movie is entertaining through out."
2,I fell asleep,"Emilio Estevez is a riot but even he couldn't save this film. Though it had a couple of funny gags, the rest of the spoof just felt silly in an unfunny way and mostly on the boring side. Sam Jackson was hit or miss in this, and all I have to ask is, what ever happend with the whole microfilm thing?? All in all, just plain weird and not so funny."
2,You Can Find These Songs Anywhere,"I'm 12 years old, and I ADORE broadway, and opera. I've starred in some musicals and a few plays. If you know broadway... then you know these songs from many dvds, and musical soundracks. The songs are excelent, but there's nothing special about this album. (You could probally hear (and see) these classics on every other cd or dvd that has ""Broadway's best"") It might be worth buying if you're not familiar with musicals. Makes a great gift! I reccomend buying Broadway's Lost Treasures, edition 1. You can see all of these performed live!"
3,"good, but not enough sondheim","A good CD for people who are just starting to appreciate broadway. the first CD is pretty good, but the second CD falls down. I think that their should have been less Andrew Loydd Webber and more stephen sondheim. I like that they kept to the original cast. One of the reviewers said that there were only two recordings that didn't have original cast. Well how about liza minnelli, or did you just forget about Jill Hayworth. favorites include (onc in love with amy, people,I'm not going,if I loved you, and try to remeber"
2,NOT WIDESCREEN or Up to Disney Standards,"The product is listed as widescreen; it is not. The other games and cartoons are grainy and not up to what we have come to know as Disney standards. There are a lot of people in this world you can't trust, but I always figured Disney was above all of this...well Walt Disney was.Now everyone is just out for as much money as they can get. Re-releasing this cute movie as a 45th anniversary special DVD is nothing more than trying to scrape in those dollars. Even at $20.00 it's not worth it.And just for general purposes, I'm sick and tired of buying any type of DVD, Movie, Video that contains ads to buy even more of their products. Most people just fast forward through them anyway.We are inundated with commercials on TV and now on movies we buy. I would love to put in a DVD and have the movie start without seeing all the hype. It's sort of like paying tons of money to go to the dentist just so he can cause you pain. It just doesn't seem right."
4,"a great disney movie, King Aurtor disney style","This is a classic for the disney collector. I am not a huge disney fan, but I do like king arthur movies, so this movie is one of the few disney movies I watched when I was younger. Of course, their are many legends of King arthur and many a film about it, and Disney's version is slightly different as well. But, it is a fun movie and has a great theme, Brain over brawn, knowledge is the key to suceed. The animation in this movie was good, although it has a somewhat different feel than some of the orininals disney films such as dumbo and snow white, but very lively colors and excellent quality animation, again good for it's time. A good one for anybodies collection, and definitely a great DVD for the disney collector."
4,sword,This is a great movie. I remember watching it as a child and loving it so I had to purchase the DVD. It arrived quickly so I could watch it :)!
3,cute,This is a cute movie that I remember watching when I was a kid. It was a solid movie then and it's a solid one now. And even better was that there were no strangely offensive tropes that seem to pop up in a lot of old disney films.
2,NOT an Audiobook!,"They make this sound like it is an MP3 compatible file that you can listen to audibly on an MP3 player. IT IS NOT! It is a file that you have to use their player to listen to, which can only work on devices which are capable of running programs, eg. NOT simple MP3 players! So while this is something you can listen to, you need a reader device such as kindle or tablet to listen to it, which then means you are better off saving the money and getting a regular book to begin with!"
5,Must have item for your car,Have this flashlight for over 5 years now - continue to work after a few cranks =)
4,"No wobbling from Watkins with ""Bold as Blue""","Top British Keyboard player Watkins has finally released a follow up to his well previous album with the Dominators.After years of playing on other peoples records (notably Edmunds and/or Lowe) and subsequently with Van Morrison and Paul McCartney, Geraint shows what he himself can do.No Alligator/Cajun stuff just excellant songs, very well played by himself and a few chosen friends (including Nick Lowe on Bass). Mostly crooning, rolling Fats Domino like songs, they are a joy to listen to and appreciate, as is his piano playing (but then again he is somewhat special on either piano or accordian). Particular favourites of mine are ""It's a wonderful life"", ""Don't Stop"" and ""Big Bad Dog"" but there isn't a bad track on the CD.You never know, he might return to do ""Another Avergae Night in Wingrave"". Now that would be special."
5,A totally hot dance mix! She's done it again!,"I was a little worried about a ""new"" mix of ""Physical"" being released, but what a great surprise! This release has totally different vocals than the original! It's lighter and upbeat (duh, it's a dance mix!) And even includes a new part to the song that shows off Olivia's sultry voice! Hope to hear it in the dance clubs! Maybe it'll prod Olivia back into the pop market!"
4,Definitely worth $20.,"Comfortability - 8Sound Quality - 9If you want the bigger, over-the-head style, headphones and don't want to pay a lot of money, these are perfect. I got them for $20 at BestBuy, so you know you'll find a similar price at most stores."
1,Very poor sound,I bought a pair of Philips behind the neck headphones and I had to trade them in. These were the only other pair they had that weren't the in the ear kind. I figured for $20 I'd get a decent pair but when I put them on they sounded horrible. There is pretty much no bass response so everything sounds like it's coming through a broken pair of speakers. I've only had them for like 10 minutes and I'm going to trade them in and hope I can get something better.
4,Excellent headphones for the money.,"Bought these headphones for use as with a guitar amplifier and they sound better than expected.The low price makes them well suited for use as studio monitor headphones, if the guitarist breaks them you aren't out 200 dollars.Wouldn't recommend them for professional DJ's or vocalists, but for mono instruments they work very well."
4,Christmas with the Chipmunks,It was great for the kids at Xmas. The order came packaged well and on time. Amazon does there business well.
5,Blondie Atomic Very Best OF,"I think this is a great album by the band to own if your a big fan of the band all the songs really sound cool,it's worth having in your collection,this is one of my favorites by the band I'm a very big fan of Blondie from the beginning."
4,"The Rock sound of CD1 is not welcome, but CD2 is nice.","I've been a big fan since 1999 with Movin' Melodies which is still one of my favorite albums. I have all of ATB's studio albums and he remains one of my favorite artists that I listen to almost every day. However, I don't like his ""The DJ in the Mix"" series.Sticking to ATB studio creations, I bought Trilogy to get more of the same great trance. In CD1, I only enjoy listening to Justify repeatedly, while others are just OK. The distinct rock sound blended with the some trance feels like bland pop-rock.CD2 has really grown on me. My media player seems to love it, so I've been listening to it often while doing homework and was really surprised when I checked and found what album the songs were from. I enjoy CD2 more than CD1.In the middle of all 95 tracks, Trilogy CD1 tracks stick out like a sore thumb. When the distinct rock sounds come on, it feels like I've already heard the style from a real rock artist.I give 3 stars to CD1 and 4 stars to CD2."
1,Are You Kidding??,"I thought I could count on Andre for inspired and soaring synth riffs (i.e.""In My Dreams"", etc.) I feel completely ripped off by this album. He has always been my number one trance artist, but now I feel like this God is dead. ATB is now ""A Total Bore"". Save your money...this album sucks."
5,Nice People,"I ordered a VHS from Lone Star by mistake. They not only contacted me within an hour of my placing the order to point out the format but, when I told them I could not use the VHS, canceled my order and suggested other sources. They were very nice and helpful. I can see why they have five stars. I will look for them as a seller in the future."
5,THE BEST--SO FAR!,"I GOT IT BECAUSE I LIKE THE REMIX OF ""LIES"". THE OTHER SONGS ARE JUST A BONUS!EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT ME THAT SOME VERSIONS THAT WE HAVE FANCIED ON VINYL BECOME QUITE ""ORDINARY"" WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE ON CD.I THINK WE SHOULD SOMETIMES JUST ENJOY WHATEVER'S AVAILABLE ---INSTEAD OF IMAGINING THE GLORY OF THE PAST!NEVERTHELESS, I DO ENJOY AND BENEFIT FROM OTHERS' VIEWS AND COMMENTS."
5,Beagle Plush,"Got him for my wife. That way she is happy. I am happy, no walking, no feeding and no picken up poop"
5,Too Bad It Had To End,"When you read the brief description of ""Beyond the Shadows Of Summer"", you might mistakenly think that this is a story for adolescents or teens, but you'd be wrong. This is a book for men and women, boys and girls of all ages. Whether you're a teenager that can relate to the book or an adult that has this book conjure up memories, it is for everyone.This is a story about first love, the tragic loss of a loved one, and the life altering experiences that you can go through due to both experiences.The book, at 188 pages, is a quick read and after the first few pages, you'll be surprised at how quickly you get to page 188.Having a teenaged son, I'm a few years removed from a lot of the experiences that the main character, James goes through...but thanks to the fine writing of Mr. Zemsky, I felt as if most of these experiences happened only yesterday.The only negative I can think of, is that the book had to end."
3,Beware the packaging,"The card seems to work OK. It comes with a coupon for 20 4x6 prints at Target, bring in the digital pictures on the card and save $5.80. (Since I don't have a camera that takes Smartmedia, I will have to transfer them from my computer to the card.) My gripe is with the packaging. The plastic is really tough and you can't open it up by cutting along the top or sides. The bottom has a ""--- Cut here ---"" line, and if you follow it exactly... you'll chop off the bottom of the card. Luckily, the part that got chopped off on mine has no circuitry and the card still works. (But if the card had slipped down a little more, it could easily have gotten ruined.)"
4,"alright album, but not THAT good..","if you prefer more accessible, dance-ish music, go with fun with knives. otherwise i would reccomend calling ov the dead. calling is by far velvet acid christ's best. the highlights on here are the title track, icon, and speedball o.d. slut has to be my favorite though, i am a big luxt fan as well and anna christine of luxt provided vocals for that song. overall this album was good, but not the best. it would be better without all the samples. the samples got to a point where they didn't enhance the music...they just became irritating."
4,VAC has done better. This is standard techno/electro,This album is really worth the buy. However it is not nearly up to par with what he has done in the past. The production level is much more solid and he's using better equipment but it doesn't have the same intensity that Calling ov the Dead and Church of Acid had.
3,What should I expect from the French,"yeah, this company is cheap, but it is cheap like how things in Japan in the 50's-60's were cheap. not trustworthy and has some issues with the pins not seating correctly or getting stuck. it was fine for a while and was cheap and that is why I give 3 stars"
3,"hot action, hot storyline, hot babes","Bought this totally on recommendation of a friend. At first I thought I had been misguided, but as the story unfolded, and the babes got hotter, I really began to appreciate the action and storyline...oh, and the babes helped too!!!"
5,Great Writing,"This is a collection of Capote's shorter non-fiction works first published in 1979. The contents include:I. Music for ChameleonsOne. Music for ChameleonsTwo. Mr. JonesThree. A Lamp in the WindowFour. MojaveFive. HospitalitySix. DazzleII. Handcarved CoffinsA Nonfiction Account of an American CrimeIII. Conversational PortraitsOne. A Day's WorkTwo. Hello, StrangerThree. Hidden GardensFour. Derring-doFive. Then It All Came DownSix. A Beautiful ChildSeven. Nocturnal TurningsAll of these works are enjoyable, but ""Handcarved Coffins"" stands out from the pack. A true masterpiece that will keep you sitting on the edge of your chair and that you'll remember forever. It alone is worth the price of the book."
2,Basically Worthless.......,"I ordered this answer key/solutions manual to go along with my textbook, right? Well this is the worst excuse of a student's aid/solutions manual I have ever seen. It is only about 1 inch thick while the actual Giancolli textbook is 4x this size. Definitely disappointing. There are only about 5 to 10 solutions from the back of each chapter when given like 50 - 100 per chapter in the text book. How do you solve the other problems like it listed in the text book? You're on your own to figure that one out. Because the answer key is very limited on their choice of problems to show. Now, the ones they decided to show were helpful, they did not make it confusing, which is a plus, but that's the only thing I find helpful from buying it. To sum it up, don't buy this manual, you will waste your money. You're better off searching online for a posted manual with similar problems online for free!"
5,Great Fun,"I bought this toy for my 2 and 1/2 year old; she loves cake so I thought this will be a good toy for her to pretend with. She plays with it everyday and gives everyone a slice of cake. Sings happy birthday, and pretend to blow out the candles."
4,A perfect birthday gift for a 3-6 year old,"When my granddaughter turned 3 I gave her this toy made by Melissa and Doug. I have purchased several of their toys in the past, both for her and for some of my friends children.This one was a big hit due to the fact that my granddaughter is just beginning to understand concepts such as special days and special foods. Shortly after the party every adult was served a piece of Sasha's special ""birthday cake"". She paid extra attention to the candles as well as explaining the significance of them to each guest (in very impressive 3 year-old-speak).I am a fan of Melissa and Doug's toys but I am a little concerned about the peeling paint issues that some have complained of. I have encouraged my daughter to keep an eye on the finish just in case. So far a great toy for a 3 year old!"
5,My daughter LOVES this toy!,"My daughter received this for her 3rd birthday and was obsessed with it right away. She plays with it constantly and due to the fact that the pieces all velcro together, only a couple have been lost. I actually just ordered her the Pizza version of this. I definitely recommend this, it's a fun toy that teaches counting!"
2,No Thanks...,"One of my children was given this as a birthday gift, and while the kids like it okay and do play with it some, I have a few issues with it. First, as others have mentioned, there is no lid to the box. Annoying! Secondly, the paint does come off the pieces! Of course, being ""food"", kiddos are going to put pieces in their mouths to pretend-eat it. (Even though I always tell them not to!) It is very obvious which pieces have been in kids' mouths, due to the paint chipping and wearing off. Even if it's lead-free, it's not a great thing to have happen! Third, there are just too many little pieces for this mom's preference and I end up finding them strewn all through the house. And finally, it's just odd to me that the two of the cake toppings are jelly beans and gumdrops. Overall, I do not like this toy and would not recommend it to others."
4,A little gem of suspense,"This early novel by the creator of Horatio Hornblower is a little gem of suspense. Nicely done, in a spare style, this moves along a nice clip. Hitchcock might have done a good film of this - attention filmmakers - it's not too late. Of course it would work best as a period piece, set like the novel between the wars. No spoilers here - just a nod to a terrific writer near the beginning of his illustrious career. Ignore the naysayers - you'll like it."
2,why did i buy this cd?,"what ever could have possesed me to do such a thing? this cd is pretty much horrible. the mxpx song is a pretty shoddy recording (even for live) but the good point is lagwagon. the rest is pretty much not so good, all/descendants has a pretty bad song, and that is the negative conotation. dont buy this, save yourself a couple of bucks."
4,Decent product,"I'm currently fixing my nephews' Ice Age movie. Slowly but surely, it's improving. With every resurfacing, the skipping is getting better. The scratch is pretty deep where it skips, so it's taking a few times, but it is a lot better.The only problem is that my computer's DVD drive doesn't like the disc anymore, but my DVD player reads it just fine. That may be the problem that other people have - they have a player that doesn't like repaired discs."
3,"Not bad, it works","If you have very, I mean very light, and faint scratches, then this will buff it out,and your cd or dvd will play!"
5,Great movie!,"A fun movie, even if you think you do not like Britney -- you will after you see this! :)"
5,Britney's movie DOESN'T SUCK!!!!!!!,"CROSSROADS is one of the coolest teen movies I have ever seen.This movie is so touching and the cast is great.Britney proved those anti-fans who said that she couldn't act wrong!!All those negative reviews come from people who didn't even see the film!I think that CROSSROADS is great,and Britney fans seem to like it allright!"
1,A good laugh!,"I must admitt the only reason my friend I saw this movie was for a good laugh. And boy did we get a good laugh. During emotional times we could not help but laugh. Lucky for us so did everyone else, except for those ""Brittany is the best"" wannabes. The movie seemed to last forever. Brittany is done with high school, Brittany is in a car, Brittany sings, Brittany has sex, and then she sings again. Sounds like a Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen video gone pg-13 (because it is).I give this movie a one for poor acting and a dumb plot; Five stars for all the middle school boyfriends and girlfriends, and a great laugh. Only see this movie if you find Brittany really hot, or you wannabe Brittany. Otherwise, skip spending your [price]."
2,Not that Bad...right?,"This movie was good for Britney. If any REAL actors were to be in this film, their careers would plummet big time. The movie is quite unrealistic and Britney is seen dancing in her bra and panties within the first ten minutes of the film and then again at the prom!! The DVD specials were boring, so I just turned it off! Please, don't count on seeing Zoe Saldana, Taryn Manning and ESPECIALLY Britney in any movies soon. I didn't like it. I mean, who would take a road trip with two people they didn't like across the country? I'm not raising my hand, are you?"
1,Worst movie I have ever seen!,"This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. It's enough to make you snooze during it! The plot just made me sick, and you can tell that they just threw very unrealistic things it in without even thinking about it or using common sense just to push the movie on, and basically forgetting about a plot. I could have made this movie when I was 8 years old. I give it two thumbs down, and if I had any more thumbs i'd put those down too. This movie really only appeals to 13 year old girls. So choose the right road when you think about seeing crossroads."
3,Kool Movie,"I think that this movie was pretty kool. Britney is not the best actress in the world, but that's alright b-cuz she rockz anyway!"
1,I went to see this with my Girlfriend and uhh..,"This has gotta be one of if not the worst movie ever. The plot first off is weak, so it might not be all of Britneys fault. Although, she does not add anything to this film. She should stick to music..well she should stick to being half naked because she acts about as well as she sings...BAD! This is supposed to be a coming of age chick flick for teens, however I have a feeling it is only liked by hardcore pop music fans that are 12 since nobody over that age is really a pop fan. Other than them, this film should have no fans and the fact it has 4 1/2 stars makes me sick. I feel sick that I have to actually rate it 1 star, 0 stars better desribes this film. VERY VERY VERY HORRIBLE MOVIE!"
1,still figuring out what Britney Spears does well???,She ain't much of a Singer much going on Live on stage&also as a Actress? Naw.this is lightweight stuff&even on that Note it's still greatly Corny.She looks Good but aside from that i still haven't found what She does that well.this Film is a dime a dozen.
1,Too terrible to be boring...,"Too terrible to be boring, this is one of those movies where you get transfixed staring at the screen wondering what in the world everybody thought they were doing. Every cliche in the book is used here, as is every corny line, scene and sentiment. This is only the most recent example of how Hollywood has resorted to blantly exploiting teens by feeding them this (stuff)!Oh yeah...just a piece of advice if you do happen to get stuck watching this film. It's so bad it begins to parody itself, so you may get a laugh or two out of its sheer stupidity.The last word: a waste of celluloid. Enough said."
5,As Described. Great Deal,"I was very pleased. I got exactly what I ordered, All in the original box, No scratches on the Disc, Perfect condition. I definitely recommend this seller.:)"
2,this was an o.k. movie!,"hello, i have seen the movie crossroads and i'm not impressed. first Britney Spears cannot act whatsoever. (nor can she sing). if you want to see a pop star act. you should check out "" A Walk To Remember"". Mandy Moore does a GREAT Job in that movie."
5,very good,it was very good i would tell my friend's about it i think my friend's should get this movie to
2,This loyal fan doesn't like Crossroads.,"I'm a loyal fan of Britney's since Baby One More Time, and I do not like this movie. It is boring, cheesy, and talks down to her fans. Far from Mandy Moore's A Walk to Remember, which was worth, well, remembering."
4,I love the movie!,"This movie is cute. I saw it because I'm a huge Britney fan and, after viewing this movie, I'm an even bigger fan! Britney is a pretty good actress, not to mention she looked beautiful in the movie. Taryn Manning was cool. And Kim Cattral from ""Sex and the City"" should of been in it more because she's a terrific actress! Give this movie a chance!"
1,"bad, less than one star","...This movie isn't apropiate for anyone, and all it's about the things you need to stay away from, likehow its ""uncool"" to still be a virgin before you're married, getting drunk, and dating guys you hardley know. Moms, don't let your kids see this movie no matter how old they are."
1,May be the worst piece of cinematic trite I have ever seen!!,"First of all I want to say that I have been a Britney Spears fan from before she became god's gift to pop music, so my view is fairly objective. Secondly, if I could give this film 0 stars, I would. The acting in this film is deplorable, the characters are a bunch of talking heads, and the story is far past the point of ridiculous. Britney and Anson Mount have zero chemistry in the love scene in the film. Perhaps the best part of the movie is in the beginning when virginal Lucy (Britney's character) and the scared high school boy (obviously also a virgin) who wanted to sleep with her after the prom were fumbling around in a hotel bedroom. At least that part came off as funny, because the rest of the film was trite."
3,Pleasently surpriesd,"All right.......it wasnt too bad......Britney did a fine job of acting......she Looked great.....she surprised me in this movie. I was really curios to see how she did. HEr friends did a great job as well. The best acting of course in this was Dan Akroyd. FINE JOB AS Britneys father. And for u fans of the TV show ED......JUSTIN LONG......is in this........Still plays his Warren Cheswick character.........that guy is great........But......I cant leave this out.....just watch for the 2 scenes where u get to see how Britney ""Looks"" what a great body she has. So I was pleasently surprised with the movie"
5,Great Movie,"I usually don't like movies like this, however, this is such a lighthearted movie that it is so easy to get through. I really liked the actor's choosen, as I said, this movie is very lighthearted and easy to get through. It is a good movie for all ages!"
4,Before Sunrise,"Ok - this was a pretty good book. The cool thing about it is the male lead, Cortez, a stoic and intensely private Comanche with waist length hair, who is working and/or has worked for a number of governmental agencies in some possibly dubious capacities. He in turn is strongly attracted to a blond, blue-eyed anthropologist from his past that has stumbled upon a murder on an Indian reservation. Some of this story is predictable and I've read other of Palmer's books that practically smoked from the sexual tension, however, this book definitely had its strong points as well."
1,Memory Mixer 3 Software,"As far as I can figure out, this product which advertises itself for the Mac, does not allow interface with the Mac's IPhoto which is where the digital photos are stored on a Mac. So what good is Scrapbooking software without pictures?"
2,Not Quite As I Remebered It,"I tried LaPerla once while shopping in duty free. The fragance is not quite as I recall it. While it has some pleasant undertones, it is quite harsh when first applied. If I had to do over, I would not order this product."
3,Basic concepts ONLY here,"I guess I was just hoping for more than just basic ideas. I've been photographing people and families for about 5 years (casually, not professionally) so I'm not sure what I wanted, but the book left me wanting more. I wanted more insights, I guess; more direction; more specifics. Too basic. A quick read."
2,The worst album Richard Thompson ever made,"I personally think there is no real defending this album. Rt is right that this is a flat out bad album. Restless Highway sounds good at first but it really is a poorly constructed song. Don't Let a Thief Steal Into Your Heart is a good song but not on this release. The band that backs Thompson up here is more of a country-rock band which does not fit at all. Plus, there is a lot of filler. Sweet Surrender, Layla and Pavanne are all throwaways. The only song of any significance is House of Cards and by the time it arrives, one has given up on the album entirely.Overall, this felt like a quickly rushed album that really doesn't need to be heard except for die-hard Thompson fans (like the ones reading this review). This release can be found on cassette but don't expect much. I guess no artist can be perfect as, in my opinion, this is the only flat out bad album he ever released."
2,Very Good. But.......!!.,"I bought this book 2006, it was already out of date. I was overwhelmed with the amount of data, but actually was more than I need as a simple user. Still thinking it is the best book on bryce software.Pros -->Only well informative book on bryce software.Cons --> So bulky & so heavy (1072 pages ).Out of Date."
1,Ignore the Liar: The Answer Book is BAD,"Obviously someone with a vested interest in promoting this book is making ridiculous comments about how great the answer book is and how they got an A+.Bullcrap. They are all written by the same person.I have this book and the alleged ""great"" answer book. It IS full of mistakes. It's typeset in the most ridiculous way. Hello publisher. It's past 2010. You have no excuse for not using typeset that I have in microsoft work. That this publisher gets away with selling that sloppy piece of crap as an ""answer book"" is offensive.Oh yeah. I got an A in the class but the ""answer book"" was as much of a hindrance as a help.Thanks for taking my money Pearson. You suck."
4,"First Nine Songs Are Cool, Rest Are Boring","I'm pretty happy with this CD. I think the first nine songs are pretty cool and enjoy dancing to most of them. These first nine tracks have very upbeat rythms. However, the rest of the songs are older and more boring. Perhaps it's just because I'm young, but I find myself skipping through those last several tracks. To be honest, if the last 7 tracks weren't as boring, I'd give this CD a higher rating.I think it's cool that this CD has the Austin Powers theme song (track 9, ""Soula Bossa Nova"") on it. Yeah baby!"
2,Needs to be cordless,"This wreath is pretty, but the outer perimeter was smashed down so it could fit into the box. And ... just where are you supposed to plug this thing in when it's hanging on the front door??? With nowhere to plug it in, the lights had to go unlit, and we had to tape the plug onto the back of it so it wouldn't show. Pretty wreath, but stupid to not make it cordless and battery-operated. Even if we had an outlet anywhere close, the ugly green cord would be unsightly against our red front door. Disappointing, especially for the price."
1,Poorly Written,"I have used the book to prepare for the PT licensure. While the review may appear to be very helpful, the information directly contradicts itself. While taking the written tests, questions will have an answer that is different from the exact same question in a later test. I do not recommend the book to anyone if this is their only guide. These problems have been verified by at least 8 other people who have taken the licensure exam and failed. While the review has great potential, at this time it is more of a hinderance than a help."
2,I felt the content review was not very thorough,"The chapters of review material did not seen very thorough to me and I actually purchased a different book with a better review of the material. I thought the practice exams at the end of the book was excellent and found the questions very thought provoking, providing a good review."
2,The worst in the series....won't get your party jumpin,"For the most part, it's like a DJ invited you into his room and began playing you repetitive filler beats and rhythms. So boring. One of the new mixes of Ultra Nate adds some vocal flavor, and finally, much later on, He Gives More lures you into thinking the party has finally begun. On the brightside, this Billboard Dance Chart club hit runs over 7 minutes. Then, to put a club anthem like Joint Is Jumpin on here in a 4 minute dub medley with another track just goes to show how badly they missed the mark here. And finally, the last 2 vocal tracks remind you what this mix COULD have been. Track times:1. feelings (5:39)2. Destiny drum (3:59)3. Free (5:10)4. Oh yeah (5:54)5. a better world (4:41)6.

1,Incredibly Boring,"I think that once Fish left, they should have changed their name to Ambien, because Steve Hogarth puts me to sleep. This album is SOOOO incredibly boring and dull and I can not get into to it, and its supposed to be best of the H albums. Today I tried, for the third time to get this album to click, but turned it off in the middle of the 7th song. I can not make it from beginning to end, no matter how hard I try.You would think the whole band left when Fish did, since this sounds nothing like Fish-era. There's no energy, or charisma or balls. Its so bland, passive and wimpy. I seriously think I hate this album, but that is just my personal opinion. I know a lot of people love this album and I respect that. I just wish I could be one of them. I love Fish-era Marillion passionately and its a true Prog crime that he only had 4 albums with the band."
3,GOOD CD - BUT NOT A MASTERPIECE,"THIS CD DOES GROW ON YOU - THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THIS ALBUM IS THE MOST ""EASY LISTENING"" OF ALL THE MARILLION ALBUMS - A CONCEPT ALBUM THAT IS MOSTLY QUIET THROUGHOUT - THERE IS SOME GREAT SONG WRITING ON THIS CD, BUT I DON'T FEEL IT'S A MASTERPIECE - THIS CD SEEMS TO BE MISSING SOMETHING MUSICALLY - I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST ""EASY LISTENING"" MUSIC, BUT FOR MARILLION IT'S TOO MUCH - AGAIN, OVERALL A GOOD CD, BUT THERE WERE BETTER CD'S IN THE HOGARTH ERA THAN ""BRAVE"""
1,horrible!!!,this album is made for the little girls! it isn't rock! this is one of the worst albums ever! no worthy! no worthy! the vocals are too peaceful!
5,It moves you,"I've been a prog rock fan for quite some time now and heard many concept albums from bands like Pink Floyd, Rush, Dream Theater, Genesis, Yes, etc.But if I had to pick 1 album to listen to for the rest of my life this one would be it. It's quite dark but that's what makes the music so rich. The musicialship, especially the guitar work from Rothery is inspiring. Before I ever came across this album I placed Operation: Mindcrime at the top of my list of best concept albums. It just got knocked off."
1,Product was discolored,"I always buy these same shoes for work. They are supposed to be bright white. The material on the shoes are discolored . It appeared that they might have been damaged some how, maybe buy extreme temperatures. I'm not sure. But I'm sure I will buy these shoes again. But I will not buy from this seller."
3,Not so comfy anymore...,"I got these shoes in 2 days ago ... I had to place a pair of Heel insoles in them for a little more cushion, but over all they are great!!! Paired with the insoles, they are like walking on a cloud - the shoes are true to size.2/18/13 - So Fast forward a few months - These are not what I thought - no more walking on clouds - I had to put insoles in them after the 1st month and they squeeze the top of my foot too tightly- Have not been wearing them in the last month and 1/2. Purchased Sketchers Go Walk to replace them - Have insoles in these too for the heels, but It's more like walking on air and my feet can breathe."
4,Has fixed hundreds of my store's game and movie disks over the years.,"This product works great if you use it properly. Follow the instructions, and you will be very pleased. Just make sure you polish the disk after you resurface. Most people who have problems have them because they fail to adequately polish the disk after resurfacing. I recommend rubbing alcohol to make the disk more shiny. I had problems when I first started using it years ago until I figured out the importance of polishing afterwards. Now I NEVER have a disk come out worse than before treatment. The fact that the included buffing square DOESN'T do a good job of polishing after treament is the reason I give this a 4 instead of a 5."
4,Really good,This is my first Fairport convention CD and I'm hooked.Love the wide range of places they take their music.
3,Not their best...,"I'm sorry, I love the Fairports, but after 'What We Did On Our Holidays' this album was a disappointment to me as a 16-year old schoolboy in 1969. There are 3 brilliant tracks (Genesis Hall, Autopsy, Who Knows Where The Time Goes?), one track that would be great if about 6 minutes was chopped off (A Sailor's life), three mundane Dylan covers and one awful Thompson filler (Cajun Woman). I still play the album often (am listening to it now) but thanks to modern technology I can now skip the lemons. Thank goodness it was quickly followed by 'Liege and Lief' - one of the greatest albums of all time!"
4,Styrofoam - The Point Misser,"Styrofoam's debut, THE POINT MISSER, is a small album, but is full of melody and variation. The short, cutesy melody of ""The Sign Only Points One Way"" gives way to the longer, heavier and harsher ""Heaven Is Burning, Pt. 1."" The thick layers on ""Words Never Spoken"" allow for a density of feeling to ooze through, while ""Future Debt Collector"" is much simpler in structure. ""It Was the Earth He Was Standing on That Was Moving"" carries a melancholy quality to the deconstructed vocal elements, underlaid by a resonant drum hit, while ""Dead Air"" has a glacial stateliness to it. Even if you miss the point, you can't miss the music here."
2,Not pleased.,Very flimsy and cheap looking (though don't know what else I was expecting for the price and number of things included). I don't recommend it.
4,Funny and a great way to get off your butt,"I'd recommend this video for anyone wishing they could do more on the dance floor than sip rum and coke. The instructor is pretty damn good and quirky as heck. You may still come out of it looking like Carlton from Fresh Prince but it's definitely a lot of fun. I'm still working on the Windmill, but I have the Cabbage Patch down pat!!"
1,Not Great,"Our 3 year old quickly lost interest with this leap pad book, but found the Dr. Suess ones to keep her attention much longer."
2,Language,"the language is a lit' bit confused for non-native english reader. I don't know about you guys, I cannot even digest the first 50 pages."
2,Bloody Yorkshire,"A churned-out provincial English dreary type of mystery, with an artsy and distracting side-plot that could well have been omitted to the benefit of the novel. Pointless literary psychologizing seems deliberately designed to slow the pace down and prevent the book from having a satisfying ending."
2,"Beautifully written, but flawed","The writing and characterization are superb. This is probably the best book in the series when it comes to portraying the Dalziel / Pascoe relationship. However, the mystery is nonexistent and the side-plot, annoying in its own right, is so blindingly predictable! All in all, a disappointment."
1,MSN Support,"When I purchased my Blackberry 8700G, I was told that I could receive my email from MSN. It worked a couple of months, and then all of a sudden I couldn't receive emails. I spent 10 hours on the phone trying to get this resolved, and was finally told that T-Mobile didn't support receiving emails from MSN...even though that is what the saleslady told me. I asked to have the device replaced with one that I could receive emails and was told by T-Mobile that they couldn't do that. So now, I'm stuck with a $300 device that won't perform as it was sold to me. Be aware... I've been a customer since 2000 and they won't even try to accommodate me, even though they weren't truthful when they sold me the product."
3,Boring Book,"Intro is somewhat interesting, but the rest of the book was hard to get into. I felt like it was a struggle to enjoy it and understand it. However, what I did get out of the book was useful."
1,Eeeeek.,"Just take a look at the drawing on the cover. That should tell you something. As someone below said, this book might be okay for someone who REALLY doesn't know how to draw (as opposed to the beginning student). There are some people who really are visually challenged, but guess what, they belong in a class where the instructor can push every visualization technique in the book at them. The funny thing about this book is how many of the ""before"" drawings, as inept as they are, are better than the slick easy cheesy ""after"" drawings. At least some of the befores have some charm. This book is a true disaster for a creative artist. We all know that real work leads to great drawing and the ability to see. The left brain-right brain is a lot of hooey."
3,The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"Looks like a very good book to have with good instruction and exercises to follow, there is a lot of text also in the book which the basic learner does not always want, most of the books I have bought previously have been more for the beginner with more step by step instruction but this is definitely not a book I would give away as I can see plenty of value in it."
5,The Best Book to start learning drawing,"Hi,I purchased this book for my 17 years young son who is preparing for design institute's entrance test. After going through the book I can surely say, "" anyone who wants to learn Drawing must first read this book from cover to cover"".As this book rightly says "" seeing is more difficult then drawing"" and the book also teaches you how to observe.I suggest this book for anyone who wants to learn drawing."
1,BAD NEWS,I seen a lot of good reviews but bad results for me. I stuck with it for a week but progresivly felt worse each day with increasing pain. Maybe helps some people but not for me.
4,Definitely the greater,"The Greater of Two Evils is the kind of book only horror fans like myself can hope for. The killings are gruesome and exactly how I like them, being a fan of Richard Laymon. The characters are so described that I found I could identify with them and I even found myselfsympathising with the killer! The book starts of slow and goes into alot of detail even though the chapters are short, but works up to a great finale.One thing is for sure and that is that even greater evils can be expected from this author."
5,Flicka movies,"I love horses & will watch any horse movie, Flicka was a favorite as a kid & still is, so I had to have Flicka 2.Love this movie."
3,Why use Machiavelli?,Well worth reading for a layman interested in problems of political leadership. But The use of Machiavelli seems to me inconsistent and sporadic. It is not enough just to use a number of quotations. I bought the book because I expected a serious description of Machiavelli's relevance. In that respect I was disappointed.
2,not what I expected,"This product only plays the three disks that come with it. The songs are just music no singing. Easy to use though, my daughter figured it out in about 30 seconds."
2,It's junk and annoying,"My 4 year old daughter was excited to get this as a gift from an out of town Aunt. She was very disappointed when she heard the ""music"". Not only is it not music from the movies, the songs are horribly done, sound cheap and play too fast.The cell phone covers don't stay on.We can't return it so it will sit, unused....until it's pitched."
2,junk,the cd player has no volume control. needs headphones. the phone that comes with it has 3 plastic earpieces that have fallen off and won't stay on it since day one. very disappointed from disney princesses. waste of money.
5,An old friend by the second listen.,Somehow he manages to keep the emotion without falling into navel-gazing sentimentality.
4,ripoff!,"helloi just bought this dvd and on the back it says:EXTRASExclusive InterviewsExtra MatchSpanish Audiofirst of all, there is no extra match.they lie to us.on the back of survivor series 2004 it says bonus matches.but theres only one match.they mislead us.theyre ripping us off.this is whats on the extras:Promos of some matches you saw on commercialsthe buildup to the triple threat match and history of the royal rumble which you saw on heatDVD exclusive extras:after the royal rumble : here cena just shakes batista's handteddy long offers batista a contractJBL interview, raw 1.31.05 - everyone saw this on raw.so where's that extra match that was promised? huh? RIPOFFSi even checked that there's not even one easter egg in the dvd.anyway, the rumble was good, but there was never a spot where it would many guys brawling,usually its about 7-8 guys in the ring throughout the whole match.casket match was good,so were the others.but im really mad about how the wwe rips the people off"
5,Great portable speaker for the ipod,"I purchased this for my husband for Father's Day 2008. He loves it! He uses it outside in the backyard, camping, on vacations, etc. It is a great little system. It charges your ipod and comes with it's own travel bag. He was amazed at the great sound for such a small unit. Great purchase. Highly recommended."
2,Very disappointed - poor sound quality,After all these great reviews I expected at least decent sound quality. Instead the speakers sound as if they are blown. Sending it back ASAP.
3,Quite please,"I use this product at work. Everything about it is wonderful except 1 thing. When you first turn on the speakers it is very loud. So loud in fact that co-workers give me dirty looks. It does not matter what the volume is when you turned it off last or if you push the volume down bottom before turning it on. No matter what I have done it does not work it is always blasting loud. It is hard to tun down anyway so when your franticly pushing the down botton and it does no good, well I just want to hide. I would not have purchased this item if I had known."
3,"great features, but problematic popping sound","I really liked the features on this speaker -- the international plug set and that it would charge my iPod -- and those features are great. The plugs are very well designed. However, two successive units made a popping sound, sometimes quite loud and frequent, when playing some (not all) files. The vendor took the first one back perfectly happily, but after the second one, I got fed up and just kept it because I wanted the plugs and because it doesn't always make the sound. But because of the popping I will probably get a different speaker unit to use around the house."
2,Beep Beep,"I replaced my original AFI below deck horn on our Cobalt with the Phase II hoping it would be louder and have a less embarrassing tone. The new horn is no improvement. The tone is very high pitched. It doesn't sound any louder than the original. It sounds like something that should be on a kid's bike, not a boat."
2,Useful Book.,"This is an interesting,informative and useful book. I used it for school and it will be one book that I keep. Great case studies."
2,Employment Law,"I think the book is so liberal and it advocate large government. Freedom is not through following the forced laws like affirmative action, ADA, etc. but having a choice especially in employment. Employer should have the say on what they want and who they want to work and not work. The book pretty much tells you that this is the law and its good for you ,so follow or else.That is socialistic.We are giving more power to the government to tie us down with more laws and regulation. Their responsibility is to protect the citizens and not to do business. That's for the private sector."
4,"What do we do, Mr. Chisum?","Chisum is a well-directed, well-acted western based on the 1878 Lincoln County War in New Mexico. Duke dominates the story, but Geoffrey Deuel gives an excellent performance as Billy the Kid, and Ben Johnson provides enjoyable comic relief as Chisum's foreman, James Pepper. The movie is even somewhat historically accurate, although Brady's successor as Sheriff was not named Dan Nodeen. Who cares? Good plot, enjoyable characters, and plenty of action make this a must for any John Wayne fan. There is one thing about this movie that puzzles me though, why would a fine young woman like Chisum's niece (played by Pamela McMyler) be interested in the affections of a killer like Billy the Kid?"
3,"OK, but not his best.","This DVD was good quality, but the actual movie is not one of Wayne's best. It is not one that we wanted to watch over again."
4,Another Great One,"I get a charge out of this album. After the departure of the great Sandy Denny, Fairport continued their concentration on British roots music. Even the original numbers here sound like traditional tunes. The band displays a somewhat more muscular approach; the instrumental rave-ups are particularly compelling. Although the band was left without a strong vocalist at this point, the harmonies are very well done, and Dave Swarbrick, handling most of the lead vocals, does a fine job."
2,Same as above,"It was a good picture but not sound,it was very low on talking and a lot of back ground noise in back we had to turn the volume all the way up in order to hear at all!"
4,"Good, but not veyr slimming.","This product gives energy and speeds digestion, but it doesn't really do too much slimming, justa bit. I would sill recommend it though, because I feel that it improves health."
1,Garbage!,"It's going back! I ordered this product and put the cupboard box together and then all the drawers. Several hours work. Then I found that the drawer heads were not only warped, but the three drawers on both sides don't have enough clearance. No real way to fix without considerable shaving and trimming. Way too much for a $699 Cupboard. Very disappointed. Drawer heads were only oiled on outside which lets moisture enter the backside and warp. I expected more from Sjoberg."
5,Great book -,"All indications from the secret negotiations between the Americans and the Japanese and, retrospectively, from the complete devastation of Japan point to Dr. Alperovitz's claim: The atomic bombs were unnecessary for the war's conclusion.Given the fact that more than 200K civilians were specifically targeted and instantaneously incinerated in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, this book leaves me the following thought: What a dreadful sin we have committed ..."
3,"""Fast, Entertaining Read.""","Once again another quick, entertaining story from Mack Maloney. I liked the concentration on the dilemmas of the secondary characters like Frost and Fitz as they try to survive in an America under the heel of Neo-Nazis. As usual in Wingman, the bad guys are sadistic and perverted. The United Americans come up with some pretty elaborate schemes to battle the Nazis. Final battle was pretty good, though the fight scenes were not as awesome as in previous Wingman stories."
5,Worthy indeed - a gem,"I cannot disagree with ""A Music Fan""'s panning of this CD. Having first purchased the Hearing CD which he/she references, I reached the conclusion that Rorem's music was too knotty and ""20th century"" for repeated listenings and enjoyment. This CD with Susan Graham completely reversed my opinion. The songs are indeed chosen to be accessible, but they are much more than that. They are, simply stated, lovely. This is a disc I will play again and again, and has caused me to investigate many other Rorem CDs. I just came on line to buy it as a gift for a friend. Rorem deserves his due, and this disc gives it to him."
5,Simultaneous Lovi'n baby,"I love this song! If you are a big fan of South Park or Issacc Hayes you have to get this single. It is the perfect blend of comedy and 70s funk. There are two versions of the single however. There is the two track version wich features the songs Simultaneous and Kyle's Mom (Heard at the end of Mentally Dull). The other version contains the songs Simultaneous, Cheesy Poofs (Not featured on Chef Aid), Come Sail Away (Episode clip), My best friend song, and Stinky Britches (Both not featured on Chef Aid). Different artwork may be used also. The promo single wich includes just Simultaneous has Chef on the cover in a pool with a bunch of women and the retail version has chef on the cover sitting in a lounge chair being pampered by women. Any version you get will be good."
3,Someting Blue could be Something Brown,"This reader appreciates the author's writing style, and would label as quite eloquent. Unfortunately, the story line quickly becomes typical and predictable. In real-life and in fantasy, its your everyday small town girl who marries get guy, great guy fools around, girl leaves boy to start new life. This was just another face; in another town; and getting there via different roads.On a positive note, the author kept this reader's scant interest and did exit the story with the dignity to not send Nick and Judy off into the sunset (at least not in diction)."
5,Something for everyone!,"I just finished this book, and must say this is a very fun and entertaining book. I like how different things are incorporated into the story such as recipes, and they are blended into the short story to go with the plot. He takes very unusual storylines and make's them work in a very funny,quirky way.I recommend this book, give it read, you'll be happy you did."
1,Poor Quality,"I am thoroughly enjoying reading this novel that I did not even know existed, but the Kindle edition that I received has many typographical errors. So many that it is distracting. Not for someone who is not an excellent reader."
1,A toy for older kids,"We just bought Little touch leap pad for our 8 months old. All that I can say is that I do not see why the company was allowed to market this toy with a 6-36 months age range. Even 8 months is way too early. Number one, I thought that the toy will actually be geared for a baby and will have a lot of music and songs. That is not the case. It is largely based on the book asking you to press on a certain button (and you have to press pretty hard!) and also asking for example to find pairs of things, or point to a blue colored piece of clothing, etc. All that on the ""first"" setting. How would you imagine a baby doing that? This toy is definitely for older children, in my opinion at least a 2 year old. I think just reading baby books so far will be much more beneficial for a baby. For us Little touch leap pad was a waste of money and we are taking ours back to the store."
2,Don't waste your $$$,"The concept of this product is great. However, it is too hard for a smaller child to use. Ex: you have to press the green ""go"" button everytime you turn a page...my two year old doesn't do that and it completely messes up the purpose of the game. He will be on a page of ""blue"" pictures but since he didn't press ""go"", the page is telling him that the pictures are ""red"" because it is still on the page from before. If I use it with him it works great, but he cannot play with it by himself. We purchased this as a toy for the car because we travel frequently, but it is of no use to us in the car. If LeapFrog could improve on the ""green go"" button, it would be much better."
3,Not age appropriate,"I thought this would be a great educational toy for my 15 month old. However, all he wanted to do was turn it on and off and pull the book out. We have put it away until he is old enough to understand it better. Fortunately the pages are very strong and did not tear even with his galant effort."
2,Good toy but what were they thinking!!!,We love the leap Frog toys we bought this for our 2 year old son thinking he could use it in the car or mommy and me time but I was so wrong all he wants to do is turn it off and on they really need to put the botton in another place so it is not right out infront of the child.
2,Not that great,I bought this for my son for christmas when he was 14 months old. He never really liked it. You have to push the pages to hard for them to say anything. my son is now 2 and he still cant really get them to say anything. I think Really an adult has to be the one to push the buttons so that makes the kids upset because they cant get the book to say anything. I really would recomend not wasteing your money on this. It is kinda expensive.
1,Not for 6month olds,"We saw this and thought, ""how neat, we can get our 6month old interested in reading and it will be a cool sharing time"". We were naive. Our 6month old, and now 10month old, just doesn't get the interactive book thing yet. She is however very interested in pulling the book off the LeapPad and putting it in her mouth. She also likes to bang the LeapPad with other toys. My recommendation: wait on buying this item. It's just not for 6-12 month olds, no matter what the box says."
4,She Loves it!,"My daughter received this as a gift from her Grandfather for her first birthday- and she loves it.We opened it early (her birthday is tomorrow) and she has absolutely no problem touching the pictures and playing with it. She loves the music setting, and also enjoys having her Father and I read the books to her. She even enjoys looking at it with her 4 year old sister. I am giving this 4 stars, because of the on/off button being on the front. She loves to push it on and off, but once we start reading the story, it's not a problem. Parents should realize that even though it says 6+ months, you do still need to help with the toy .The point of the toy is to help you introduce reading to your child, along with music and simple games-not to teach your child for you. I think it is wonderful, and I have recommended to many of my friends just in the past day! Overall- it is a great toy!"
3,Look at the books more than use the Leappad,"I bought this for my daughter when she was 7 months. She is now three years old and can finally push on the pages hard enough to make it work. She actually spends more time just looking at the pages than actually using the Little Leappad as it is intended. We now have a second daughter who is 12 months as she has experienced the exact same thing.We do play together with the girls using this product; however both my children are quite independent and want to do this for themselves. When they can't get it to work - primarily because it requires to hard of a touch to activate - they get frustrated and move on to a new toy.I am a huge fan of LeapFrog. However, must admit I am disappointed in this product. It is not their best. Due to our experience with this product, we have opted not to purchase the Leappad for our daughter and instead went with a competitor's product. Hopefully, we will have better luck."
1,All my daughter does is turn it off and on,"My 18 month old daughter all it does with it it's turn it off and on. You have to start all over again once it's turned off, so it is very anoying!!!!!!!They shuold have not left the on/off button so visible for the children. It is very irritating. You have to be with your child at all times while playing with it, because it makes them frustrating not to be able to star it again once they turn it off."
2,Too hard to operate,"I bought this for my son's 1st birthday because I thought it would be a great educational toy. I found it to be very hard to operate. It took alot of pressure to push the buttons. I would think if a 6 month old is suppose to be able to operate it, then the touch pad would work with a feather touch. You really have to press hard to get it to respond. Also, as other have said, the books are paper. My 1 year old will destroy it in a heart beat. Needless to say, I am returning it."
2,You can wait for 1st Leap Pad,"We bought this for our son at 6-months and then it it was nice because it was great for story time to hear music and soundscapes. However, it was no more fun (or animated) than when we read our paper books with lots of sound effects. Now he's 16-months and only turns it on and off because the touch pad is too difficult to activate for little fingers. His favorite book to hear is ""Mr. Brown can Moo can You"". This is a great book with lots of sounds but my son can't get it to work on his own. So this toy is only good when I am playing with him. In that case, I prefer to cuddle up with a good old fashioned hard bound Mr Brown and make my own ""Moo"". I should have waited for the other leap pads. I hear they're great."
1,This thing sucked,This thing is the worst toy EVER invented. I wanna teach my kid how to read by myself instead of watching her by herself. She had nightmares for 8 WEEKS over that thing! NEVER BUY THIS!!!!!
2,"Umm, yeah, it's an ok, but spendy tool.","I agree with many of the other reviews. My 21 month old only pushes the on off. When I get it out he asks for other books. I am starting to try in with my 6 month old, though so maybe she will get the idea of it sooner. It's quite an initial investment and new books are about 13 dollars. Also, now it comes in pink and blue so if you are color trendy, you may have to have two if you have a boy and girl!! Also, Leap needs to MOVE the on/off button to the back and make it a switch. This is the most dissapointing of all my Leap toys, and I can't wait for my son to ""graduate"" to the next pad."
2,Not what I thought,"I got this Leapad for my 18 month old. Because she loves reading and me reading to her, I thought this would be great. When we sit down to use the leapad she trys to sit on it. I think she likes the little pillow because she turns the toy over and sits on this side too. The go button must be pushed when turning the page, but my little one hardly lets me help and turn the page. She does however enjoy the cards that come with the toy defining numbers, colors, etc. I use them without the leapad and read to her myself. I was very disappointed."
4,Great toy,"It did take a while for my first son to get into this. The pushing the pictures on the pages and pressing the green go button was a bit challenging at first.However, my son is now 4 and still LOVES this leap pad. He is getting a Leap Pad for Christmas this year and we'd love to pass this one down to little brother but it has honestly been ""worn out."" We still have all the books so little brother is getting a new Little Touch for Christmas this year.If you are looking for independent play.. like so many moms commented on. First of all...9 month old babies don't ""sit"" and play. They play by exploring. Nothing is going to keep their attention for long.I think this is best suited for 18 mo and old crowd, especially two year old that want to sit and play, independently or with their parents. This is a great learning tool!"
3,Not for ages recommended,"My daughter now almost 17 mos has had this since last Christmas, then almost 6 mos. I was a teacher (preschool and 1st grade)and we were very excited to get it. Well...all she wants to do is turn the pages back and forth...not gently either. The pages are very flimsy and would not last long if we used it often. I don't like to tell her ""no"" when reading, so we just don't get it out much. If they could figure out how to make a board book for this it would be awesome. I think we'll use it around 2 or so when she can understand more about taking care of things. Even before she turned 1, she grabbed the pages all the time. Some are even ripped now...and they're not cheap! Great buy for the older toddlers."
1,too complicated,"The books are not fixed, the sheet overlays rise up because they are bent in the middle, have to 'touch lightbulb' then 'touch start' to play then if the child hits either one of these 2 it stops. I bought this for my son's 1 yr birthday and turns 3 this week, he hasn't played with it for more than 5 minutes ever. I keep it hoping he will like it sometime. He's a very bright child but would rather take the book off the pad and ""read"" it."
1,waste of money,"This is a toy we never play with! My daughter received this for Christmas last year when she was 1 1/2 years old. Now, at 2 1/2 she is still not strong enough to push the pictures to make the sounds. She pushes the on/off button a few times and tosses it aside. Keep your money and stick to good old fashioned books!"
2,"Good idea, poorly made","I have to agree with most of the parents here. I bought this product when my son was around 7 months and he didn't take ANY interest in it and still doesn't now. he likes to listen to me read to him from other books and even turn the pages (he's 1 now), but this one just doesn't hold his attention. I believe the pages should be heavier (a 6 month old can not turn flimsy pages!) the buttons have to be pushed pretty hard as well and small hands can't do that either. leap frog seriously needs to work on this product and offer a call back or refund on this product."
2,I was a nice thought,"The thought of this toy is great my daughter, 1 year old, and I could interact with the book and have fun. Well all she want to do is press the on and off button. Also it is very awkward to use. If you touch the wrong part of the page the computer will think that you are using a different book, and my daughter is constantly touching the wrong spots on the page. It needs to be more user friendly.For us it was a waste we never use it."
3,"A decent product, but...","My only complaint about this product is the lack of corresponding materials. But this is a huge complaint! My son loves the animals book but the others are not exciting enough to hold his attention. Also, all the character books (Wiggles, Dora, Elmo, Dr. Suess) only come for the My First Leap pad. When we are in stores, he shows a lot of interest in these other books. Had I been aware of this, I would have skipped this step in the leap frog path."
1,Far less fun than board books,"My son received this present for his first birthday and it was way too advanced for him. It is difficult for him to push the pad hard enough to get a reaction. Only the on/off button seems suited for baby use. A friend and her 18 month old tried it also - I was desperate to give it away - and they refused it for different, equally problematic reasons. My son loves board books and being read to but he has no interest in this. Since then I have tried to give it away to other moms, but all of them agree that it's highly user unfriendly and don't want to waste time with it. I guess my son will continue using it as a stepping stool to reach objects on his toy shelf. It's a waste of money. The Leap Frog company should be held accountable for their slick and misleading marketing of this product."
2,TOO hard for the age range,"... A toy sold for 6month olds should not require 3 steps to start it and the keys are way too hard to for them to push. They get frustrated when not able to turn the pages and have the toy work. Not to mention the on/off switch which is fun to play with but you have to restart the toy with three steps everytime they turn it off. The system does not have an auto shut off if not played with. The pages are not durable enough for 6 month olds. Good toy for a 3 year old but not the ages they advertise. And I do sit a read to my child but it is hard for me to get it to work!! ANd they should have time to explore toys themselves, not be spoon fed all the time."
1,Disappointing!!!,Read a real book to your kids it would be more entertaining and educational. A book that has noises or flaps is cheaper and more fun for you and your child. for many resons - keep reading the rest of the reviews- this toy isn't worth spending money on. I do love all the other leap frog products. Very dissapointed leapfrogger!!!
1,Not Made with a Baby in Mind!!!,"Although the this toy sounds like it would be great. It's not! First the book has paper pages. Not the shiny coated paper, but regular thin paper that will easily rip. But the part that gets me the most is the age range is all wrong. In order to make this work, you have to push 2 different buttons on seperate pages so that the leap pad knows what page your on. My toddler sure doesn't understand that. Plus you have to push really hard to make the book respond. I have a 10 month old and a 2 year old who both get so frustrated with it. The 10 month old becuase she can't make it work, and thhe 2 year because when he touches things, it always says the wrong thing because he didn't press the 2 bottons first every time you turn the page. I can see a 3 year old playing with this maybe, but the 6 month-2 year age recemendation is all wrong!"
2,Not impressed,"We bought the Little Touch for my 11 month old, and of course he wasn't impressed with the story, he wanted to tear up the books. My main problem is that our books don't fit into the console. Every one of them except the book that came with the product fall out. It is very hard to have story time with him and he can literally pull the story out."
5,We love it!,"I have debated on purchasing this since my son was six months old. I was really concerned with some of the reviews, but kept coming back to it in the stores. My son is now 17 months old and is borderline obsessed with books. I took my husband in to look at it two weeks ago and we decided to give it a go. I couldn't be happier! We all love it! I thought the button pushing would be more of an issue, but to my surprise, he is able to make it work most of the time! When we brought it home I couldn't figure out how to make the activity card work, so I called customer service. It turns out that it was a silly overlook on my part, but the service was exceptional! It was fast, friendly and very helpful...which was great with an inpatient toddler waiting. Thanks leapfrog for such a fun educational toy!"
4,Quite Enjoyable,"We received this as a gift, and we rather like it. Right now our son, 6 months, enjoys destroying the pages. I love the fact that they don't rip (but they do get quite wrinkled)! I love the fact that the different levels change the story and sounds, so as they grow, so does the story. The books pop in and out easily, and are hard for my son to take out. My one downfall is that I have found it rather difficult to find books! I know I can find them online, but in the stores it has become rather challenging. Hopefully this is just because the Holiday rush has taken them all."
4,How to Be a Rapid Reader : 6 Steps to Increased Speed and Co,"It's a basic level book about speedreading, but helpful."
1,Spider-Man 2 for kidz!,"Seeing the screenshots, videos, and general art direction of this game got me quite excited. What I was expecting was an update to Spider-Man 2 with cel shaded graphics and new moves/secrets/characters/etc.What it boils down to is a very short and repetitive experience with little to no replay value unless you like looking for little tokens in a huge, ugly city. If you're expecting the fine tuned controls and moves from Spider-Man 2, you'll be disappointed. You can do anything from the very start of the game, and it's very little.I wouldn't even recommend this as a time waster, it's just an excuse for Activision to rake in some cash."
4,"Good game, lame graphics",This game was good but the graphics were pathetic. The game was a little confusing because of bad directions. It took me about 2 months to figure out one part! But overall this game was awesome.
3,THE CONTROLS ARE HIDEOUS!! JUST RENT IT!!!,I am huge Spiderfan and am willing to forgive almost anything a game does wrong as long as it is fun. Unfortunately the controls in this game are god awful. I was able to beat the game and knock out a good chunk of the unlockables in two sittings and all the while I fumbled about like a complete idiot thanks to the lousy controls. Plus every single boss battle and story mission is precipitated by or consists of a pointless and frustrating chase. The game looks great and truly does feel like a comic book which is cool but Spider Man 2 is still a much better game. Not worth owning even for die hards.
1,Dont waste your money,"I feel really stupid for buying this product. What do you expect for this low price. Junk?Well, that's what you get. The ink didn'tlast at all. I went through these cartridgesat a rate of about 4 to 5 times quicker than. theManufacturers ink.."
3,Good Savings..Despite,"These cartridges represent quite a savings when using frequently for gardening photos. We have had a occasional cartridge that will not be recognized by the printer, but at the price we pay, we can still save money despite the occasional malfunction. Just ordered again.Recommend the printer be cleaned frequently.Never any problems with the black color. The last goof was on magenta. Before that, a bad yellow cartridge."
1,Leaky mess,"These cartridges worked fine the day I installed. The next day they wouldn't print until I ran through a clean cycle. The next day no go again, changed to another one of these and it worked for a day. Found ink all over my hands and ruined my good shirt. Replaced with Brother product and have had no more trouble.... Don't waste your money on this product."
1,Simple Minds,"This book is simple minded and redundant. Two mice sniff out the cheese in the maze of life, one elfkin human refuses to look elsewhere when it runs out, the other finally takes a risk by doing so. I agree it's a stretch to call this a book. It is a quick and easy read even for a ""look-say"" reader. If you feel compelled to read this go to the local bookstore and read in it the aisle. You would get more entertainment and a greater life lesson in value from lighting the cash this book costs on fire and contemplating what you've done while watching it burn. This is by the wrong half of the One Minute Manager writing team. If like me, you are in need of directed ""self-help,"" skip this pablum and read something with useful application advice like, Eat That Frog by Brian Tracy."
4,be adaptive or extinct,"yes that's what ""who moved my cheese"" intimates to the reader. the author must've taken a lot of pain to bring such simple facts of life in a simple language. the book differs from other conventional ""moral boosters"". it really keeps the reader interested in ""what next"". here he took ther example of two mouse and two small people. the principles of the story are narrated in simple and interesting way.the book can easily be corelated to day to day life"
2,The Authors Moved My Cheese !!,"A pretty simple concept written in a fictitious form talking about ""Changes"".... Don't fall into the trap with the name of the book, if you like cheese.I wonder why a book with such a simple concept, like this one, can turn into such a huge success (this pure means the number of copies sold and the money earned over the last few years). I even bought some 40+ copies for my staff and counterparts even before I finish reading it as a good friend advised me so. I swear I won't do this again without myself reading the book first.I definitely know now it's Spencer Johnson and Ken Blachard, the two authors, who moved by cheese BIG TIME !! I actually gave them a big loaf of my cheese. Do you want them to taste your cheese? It's your choice !!"
2,Not what I had expected...,"My broker purchased this book, & loaned it to me. I was really excited about reading it. Once I started, I must say it wasn't what I was expecting. Of course I understood the moral of the story, but it just seemed a little silly to me. At best, I guess I could say, it was a ""cute"" little story. Wonder if the author could write another version, maybe for the ""grownups"" this time? J.F. Lyles Eddyville,KY."
3,Another Cheesy Little Self Help Book,"that will sell a bazillion copies and become the guiding light to a generation of corporate types...until the next gimmick comes along.Ok, that's the negative. The positive side it, it's really fairly good! Johnson makes some good points. ""What would you do if you weren't afraid?"" Is a powerful self-assessing tool. I've been thinking of that statement ever since reading the book.It's definitely formulae-based, it's definitely a gimmick. But doggone it, I've had my cheese moved before, and on some level it did speak to me!It's definitely a worthy read. Cover price of (...) NO WAY! It's more of a pamphlet than a book...you can read it in a solid 45 mins to an hour. Amazon's price is in the ballpark.Better yet, your boss could buy it for you! But watchout, he may have his fingers on your cheese!"
1,best seller? only proves that americans are lemmings....,"I found this book to be irritatingly simplistic and didactic. Yes, it's supposed to be an allegory, but it's too heavy-handed to be cute or impacting. Don't waste your time or money."
2,"Sorry, folks; this one is just ok.","Very much skewed to the corporate mentality, I read it in a support group for adults ""newly alone"" thru death and divorce. Admittedly, my perspective is probably not the one for which the book was written, so take my lack of rabid enthusiasm with a grain of salt. I object strongly to the two ""mice"" and their stereotypical characterizations. Hey, move your own cheese. If I had known what it was about (ones persective on change and challenges is what makes the difference), I wouldn't have schlogged thru it. Rave reviews? Sorry, folks; this one is just ok."
2,"Good metaphore for chnage, but...","The two mice and two little people characters of this book show good metaphores for change. However, the story and the premise needs more to be practical in the business world today. After you have read this book, you do feel ""comforted"" that there are individuals like you, but the issue is that the change that happend to YOU is very unique, and this book does not deal with that."
1,Absolute rip-off,"Change happens; deal with it. That is the total wisdom you will gain if you waste your money and an hour to read this grossly overpriced book. In 94 small pages of large type and full-page, repetitive illustrations, there is nothing useful. I have found more actual wisdom in a single Dilbert strip. The last several pages are nothing more than a blatant attempt to persuade gullible managers to buy the book by the ton. Apparently, that tactic has worked very well. I am not sure what that says about American business education, but it can't be good."
1,Welcome Back to 3rd grade,"very simple reading and possibly an effective starter book for those who have not been in position to require any motivational skills. the book, however insults the intelligence of those who are the least bit aware of ethical business practices."
5,Radical,"First, let me say that my life was changed by this book. I stopped whining, I grew up, and I gained a mature perspective on my life. This book is incredibly instructive and valuable to anyone who wants to face life head-on. Two enthusiastic thumbs-up from a man turning over a new leaf!-Bean"
1,Who Moved My Cheese,"It is a shame there's not a ""no star"" rating for a book like this. In all my years in business I have never read a book with so little to offer. Not only is it written for the third grader, it is packed with such infantile and hackneyed platitudes that it's demeaning to the serious reader.If this is considered a""hot"" business book, the future of our business community is in serious trouble.Try writing a book that challenges the mind, not one that numbs it."
2,Book that explains why change is good,"I quick little book that explains - thru a fable of mice and cheese - why change is good. In today's fast moving world, change happens constantly in both our personal and professional lives. This quick read teaches readers on how to adapt, change and accept to the everchanging world around us. If you do not wish to read the book, simply take note of 7 rules of change that books is trying to address: change happens, anticipate change, monitor change, adapt to change quickly, change, enjoy change and be ready to change quickly and enjoy it again & again. This short introuction could save you an hour of fairy tale read. I guess most people must like it simple. This book was - believe it or not - a bestseller."
1,A Red Flag if you receive a copy,"I once worked for a bank that ordered copies of this book* for their IT department.The bank subsequently outsourced their IT operations to EDS.Enough Said.I ditched my copy a long time ago hoping this book and the industry built around it would fade away. Unfortunately, this industry is still active and I'm now compelled to give my two cents on this fad-that-wouldn't-die.If you receive a copy from an employer, look for a new job. If you are invited to a seminar featuring the ideas from this book, save your money. If your company brings in a ""who moved my chesse"" consultant, call in sick.Imagine if the founders of this country received this book from King George--we'd still be a colony today!* the HARDCOVER edition--the bank didn't skimp!"
5,How to deal with change.,This book helps you understand your own reaction to change in your life. That knowledge helps you deal with the future changes.
3,Good Read,A nice short read it took a very short time to catch on to what it was about. In the end I was surprised.
5,NEW CHEESE IS GOOD FOR YOU!,"""Who Moved My Cheese?"" is an enjoyable quick read. It offers the reader tools to motivate the spirit. New chesse is good for you!"
5,Most Useful Book I've Ever Read,"sure the book is about something you've already know, but yet of all books. it was the only one that helped me so effectively and instantly, and probably the smallest one too!I can see why it wouldn't get 5/5 ratings from everybody, since it's such a tiny little book and it talks about sth that's almost close to common sense.but if you're having trouble dealing with changes, and need something that will help u instantly and effectively, this is it."
3,Changing World Requires Changing Thoughts,In this changing world this book will give you a great perspective on looking at your career and where you might be headed. Now is the time to make sure we are all on track so we can best manage our jobs and life in general.
1,Shallow and simplistic,"A big disappointment! The author tried to use a metaphor to explain how to deal with change in life but I didn't see any explanations in this book, just a shallow story. The message he tried to convey could have been written like this : 'Accept change or else', no need to read the book to understand that. I don't understand all the hype around this book, I certainly don't recommand it to anyone!"
5,I no longer fear change,"I have been through 2 site closures in 15 years. Now, last Tuesday the company that I have worked for for 14 months announced we have been bought by Motorola. This time I was able to recognize the writing on the wall and am anticipating another site closure. After reading this wonderful book, twice, I can accept change. My future holds a new adventure of looking for ""New Cheese"". Thank you Dr. Spencer Johnson for helping me to face what I use to dread. CHANGE."
1,A very superfacial book,The only thing creative of this book is its attractive title. There is no substance in its content. The author kept repeating a few obvious points in the book. Not recommneded.
4,An Easy and Informative Read,"I thought that Johnson did a great job turning a clever little parable of mice and ""little people"" into a very easy read that also incorporated useful lessons in the real world. You can apply it to all walks of life, and people of all ages and places in their lives should be able to related to it."
3,"""Very"" simple reading ...","This is an example of the type of books that make bestsellers today: very simple reading for people that not only do not have the time for profound reading but do not have the ability for profound reading. It is very sad. The final message is nice, though, even if it is so obvious. I guess Dr. Johnson knows who are his target readers."
3,Worth a quick read,"One of those ""must read"" (as they say) books that's a quick read. I did like it, but it wasn't overly profound or groundbreaking. It had good messages and good cliches to follow. I'm sure it would benefit many people, though."
1,Oops! We fell for the hype!,"My book club, usually an astute bunch, decided to read this book because it was on the bestseller list so long. Big mistake. It was available at our local bookstore only in hardback, so we paid nearly $20. for it--it was discounted a bit, and we like to support our local store on occasion. We felt like idiots--and you'd have to be an idiot to call this book ""amazing"" and ""life- changing."" The only life change I experienced was my wallet being $20. lighter. The author should be ashamed of himself, though I suppose he should be commended for coming up with a remarkable marketing ploy. I won't even put this book on my library shelf--and I certainly won't waste a bookplate on it. We will stick with books that inspire, teach, and motivate us from now on. That doesn't need changing!"
1,Just be a good little employee.,"Don't question the change. Just accept it, no matter how wrong it may be. People who stand around thinkin' are just chumps.If your boss wants you to read this, be suspicious.Here, I'll save you the ten minutes it'll take to read this dumbed down, insulting, 10,000 word volume: Change? It's good. You should embrace it, not fear it.Anybody who didn't already know that? Hmmm, nobody! Anybody who thinks it's always that simple? Hmmm, nobody! Interesting."
4,"Simple, but profound concept of change!","This book is very simply written, however contains a profound lesson of change. Change is the only inevitable part of life and to be able to flow with change and use it to our advantage is the great challenge of successful living. Embrace change in your life and immense rewards are well on their way.Author of Your Daily Walk with the Great Minds of the Past and Present"
4,Who moved my cheese,Quick easy read. The book helps you to see how it's story/ideas play in your daily life.
5,A Parable (Actual Story) for the Buisness World,"This is a quick read, but it is a very useful book. We are constantly faced with changes, both in our professional and social lives. We need to recognizite change, cope with it, and manage our lives around it. I have survived 2 rounds of layoffs and one merger, which helped me relate very well to this story.Most of us will relate to the ""mice"" in this story. Some of them remind me of my coworkers and family members. Sometimes humans have a hard time coming to grips with the obvious and they need to be ""shown the way.""This book is a must read for business people, although everyone will enjoy it."
1,Apparently there is a need,"This is another study from The University of the Bloody Obvious. It is a long winded and silly way of saying. ""To succeed in life you must change with the times"". But apparently there is a need for this today. My son is a business consultant. He produces miillions of dollars revenue for his firm by telling people at large old companies that they must change there operations to meet competition and market conditions."
1,"Drivellll, complete bore this guy should be punished","More utter drivel from an other bs artist. This book has reccomendations for doing things in your life that ""up your sales"" and avoiding ""ruts"" and repeated behaviors that you feel should [who feels this way] yield results when the game has changed....Its like the guy is a classic ""master of the obvious"" Save yourself some money.. don't buy this patronizing essay designed for managers who want to simply dull and blunt the brains of thier inferiors...sure to be a best seller at business schools for that exact reason...n don't think...thats what otehrs do....read Winning through Intimidation by Ringer instead....Real Politique still rules the world...."
4,Changes happen in the workplace and in life. Put your faith in God.,Have faith in the Lord. When changes occur do what you can to make it through the storms of life. Admit things have changed. Believe God will see you through. Keep the faith and be ready to deal with unforseen changes. Most of all believe in Jesus and keep the faith. A better day will come![...]
5,A Thinker's Book,"My advice is simple: Try this book. Its a one-hour read. However, don't undertake this task while your brain is relaxing. Those that don't take something away from this book are either unfocused or require that a book meet the ""weight test"" to measure up. Don't allow yourself to be fooled.Sure, this book's ""story"" is about 4 rodents, a maze and their quest for cheese. But the concept is much, much deeper. Personally and professionally, the concept rings true. Those looking for the easy path, the ""tried-and-true"" path, the concrete path, will never reach new heights. The book's parable leads the reader through the maze that is life, again, your personal or professional life.I'll not go any further with the concept or the story as I believe each reader should experience the book and decide unilaterally. A warning: be prepared to THINK and focus on the concept. You'll not be disappointed."
5,Postive learning (self help),"I really enjoyed this book. It teaches you how to deal with changes going on in your life. And how to look at change in a postive way. It's not your every day ""self help"" book. It's very easy to understand. I think most people will enjoy it."
4,Finding the Cheese!,"I bought this book for a friend who does not like to read nor does he like to accept help, from a book or person. He has been going through a rough time, both in his personal life and at work. He needed to figure things out for himself, but really didn't have any idea where to begin. He is a businessman-he wants the facts upfront and easy to understand. I read the book before giving it to him and while I found it somewhat elementary, it did get its point across, loud and clear. It truly is perfect for impatient people, like my friend; it gets to the point very quickly and the metaphors make it easy for anyone to understand. It has become my friend's favorite book and now, when I have a problem, he even quotes passages from the book to try to help me figure out what to do. It is a great book and I would recommend it to anyone to read!"
1,Premise flaw dooms this book...,"The fatal flaw of ""Who Moved My Cheese"" consists in the fact that at no time is the maze in which the characters run viewed as being dangerous. Without this factored into the allegory, it bears no resemblance to real life. Therefore, it cannot be applied effectively.People are often hurt in the maze of life attempting to get from one point to another. If that element of life could be removed, then life becomes as simple as the story in Johnson & Blanchard's book."
5,A life changing book,It is one of the best books I have ever read. Should be read by everyone. It's like placing a mirror in front of you and daring to look. Sometimes the image isn't that flatering.
1,This book is a JOKE!!,"The point of the book is don't resist change. Learn to adapt and move on. Good. But, it also says don't think about the change. Just absolve yourself of any moral responsibility and go with the flow. Not Good. The model employees are rats with no emotions; they just do what they are supposed to do. Great if you're a manager, not if you're an employee. It's books like these that lead to Enron disasters...managers figure out how to make more money, employees just do as you're told!"
1,Drivel,"Life is tough. It takes thought, consideration, deliberation. What is worth striving for other than a centered authenticity?I'm pretty sure human beings can adapt to almost anything, and this book will encourage you. Do you need that sort of encouragement?"
1,Why Read This Garbage,"This book is not only a GIANT waist of time, but is also a way for someone in charge to try to convince you that you have to live with their change. I was given this book by my principal and was ORDERED to read it. After this we were instructed about all of the ""wonderful"" changes that we would be honored to be a part of. Less planning and lunch time and more responsibility outside of the classroom. As a added bonus, we were going to be reviewed in the classroom by a set of new and unproven standards made up by people that had never taught. All the while being reminded with the mindless and gutless performance of the rodents in the book. If you receive this as a ""gift"" never turn your back on the person that has given it to you. They are looking for a way to impose their mandate with the least amount of challenge as possible."
3,Not what I expected!,After the many raves and reviews I received from friends I thought this book would be a little more exciting. It was still a good book and I learned a little from it. I think I'm more of a Haw
3,A Good Value,"While it is true that much of the information in the book is nothing new, I think those that pan the book on that basis forget that knowing what to do is only half the battle - the other half is actually doing it. What then may appear to be a negative as far as simplistic dialogue and small size becomes an asset in the rereading necessary to change ones habits to incorporate the wisdom of these few pages. Change is the one constant after all, so dealing with it is crucial as the book makes very clear. It's an excellent brief parable."
1,Someone please shot the Mice!!,"Life changes. Those who adapt, survive better and are happier.Please send me $5.00 for this point of wisdom as that's what this book is all about."
2,Not exactly motivational,"I understood the concept of the ""Cheese"" and I don't think I'm above adapting to change, but that is just it. The book doesn't really give you ways of dealing with change, and it doesn't really motivate you to change. It basically tells you ""Change or Die, it's your choice"". It's basic point is what everyone knows and hears day in and day out and that is that ""Change is Good!"" Thank you - next book please."
3,This Book is For Idiots...I Should Know,"This book is a useless waste of time. I read it carefully -- believe me -- I have the mental scars to prove it.CHEESE prepares each reader to become a mindless, unthinking automaton. The book should be avoided at all costs...unless, of course, mindless automatism is your kind of thing. Then, by all means, ENJOY!"
5,LIFE CHANGING - AWESOME!!,I highly recommend this book to anyone. I started hearing all these great leaders mentioning and then friend and family and so I got it on Audiobook from Audible.com and listened to it twice in one day then bought the book to give to people. It's such a small book and short / easy read that you just can't imagine the impact it will have on you.Enjoy!! and I would love for you to comment and let me know who you think you are in the story ;)
5,A good slap in the face!,"This book is an excellent quick read for everyone. The analogies utilized remind people how to properly, and improperly deal with change and are superb.It details how even people afraid of change can come around and embrace it.A must in the dealing with change, for all's business library."
2,book = not compelling; ideas = helpful,"The book itself is really simplistic and not particularly interesting. In fact, I was quite bored for about 1/2 of it. However, when Haw finally starts to take action, some of his insights are fairly inspiring. There's really nothing new here, and certainly not all change is good, so don't take the message TOO seriously. It's not ALL attitude, but much of it is. For example, sometimes life just throws stuff at you; when that happens, your attitude does make a difference. The best parts simply encourage you to face your fears and find the good stuff, the silver linings. Make lemonade, to use another cliche.You can easily skip the discussion at the end, and probably the intro as well. Don't expect anything earth-shattering. It's a pep talk, no more, no less. But it can certainly come in handy for that. Best use: Take the best thoughts/quotes, print them out on your computer, and put them up where they'll inspire."
1,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible","Sickeningly trite and condescending. Shame on Dr. Spencer for writing such drivel, and a pox on Putnam for publishing it."
4,Good Message,"Change is something we all have to deal with on some level and not everyone is going to deal with it in the same way. Some change we can fight, other change we cannot and it is good to know the difference. I loved the writing style and think it was an interesting was to present this message."
3,ACCEPT IT,"ACCEPTANCE is actually a good lesson to learn. It allows for patience, and how many of us have tried to rush something to find themselves back to where they started. Sure its great to fight for something you believe in but how much power do we have to really change the things we can't. We need serenity to have acceptance. And for those that ""believe""...how often have we been taught to step aside and put our lives in His hands. We cannot be the master and the servant at the same time. Just be aware of whom you are serving? Who's the big cheese? Damn, I need to read this book! (it sounds exciting)In all, we should not look to literature as a basis of our lives. Those of you that don't want to feel offended or cheated by a book, should stick to stuff thats a bit more lively-read Harry Potter!"
5,Change is a good thing!,"For anyone who feels stuck in a rut, unable to change, afraid of new challenges or opportunities, this book is for you. In a lovely parable, the author demonstrates the pitfalls of stagnation and how change, particularly when you play nice with others, moves life in a positive direction. This book is more than a business book. It's a book about life. I would also recommend these two other books about life and embracing change: Vita's Will: Real Life Lessons about Life, Death & Moving On and The Goddess of Happiness- A Down-to-Earth Guide for Heavenly Balance and Bliss."
3,"Review of ""Who Moved My Cheese?""","This is a useful if general book. The advice is often hard to argue with, yet still important if only because this advice is good but often ignored. This book helps in transmitting the need to consider options of paths in improving our lives. ""Who Moved My Cheese"" tells a parable about how mice, accustomed to conquering a maze where cheese is hidden become so adapted to the routine path, even reorganizing their lives around this path, fall apart when the cheese location is moved. The morale of the story is we must learn to adapt to change. Indeed, especially in these vibrant times, we must prepare for the inevitability of change, recognize when important elements are changing, and properly react to these changes. This book aptly describes common sense without prescribing specific techniques. To the degree many have forgotten coomon sense, this book serves to remind us and wake us to realizing that common sense should prevail."
3,Food for thought !?,"First off, it's a extremely easy read. I found it entertaining and I believe I'll remember the concepts and think back on them through the years.But, ""Move in, consume all, move on"" -- this is more a set of guidelines for locusts than ideals for healthy living to apply widely. I have found it didn't apply well to MANY aspects of my life/relationships, while the story hints it is a universal truth to be applied to almost anything we deem ""Cheese"".I agree with some other readers that it definitely talks down to us, but that's expectable from a parable about 'cheeze'."
3,Good for Self Improvement,"Good Motivational book. Yes, very simple and straight forward, but one can learn lessons and a bit about mindset reading through this very quick read."
2,A waste of money and time,"This book didn't live up to the hype that caused me to order it, nor the continued self-indulgent hype at the beginning of the text. I forced my self to read the whole book in the hope I would find a nugget of worthy advice, but the ""epilogue"" only reinforced the vanity of the author."
5,A Parable for Modern Life's Challenges,"This short and easy to read book is deceptive in its simplicity. Less of a time investment than a typical business meeting, this parable for the challenges of change allows readers to identify traits within themselves through its characters. A series of ""Aha!"" moments again and again. A great tool for expanding one's thinking and perspective."
2,Over Rated,"The actual book is only about 30 minutes long and has a long, drawn-out introduction.Given the media hype associated with this book, my expectations were much higher.The book could serve as an encouragement for someone who has recently lost their job and is seeking employment, but I don't recommend it beyond that.I think the authors are deceived if they think these principles apply equally to relationships as they advertise."
3,Obvious,It is hard to face changes and this book makes the reading about it very easy. The style is one of its strenghts. But then the obvious comes too often and you may soon find out that you are reading what you already know. And you may be pretty right.
4,Powerful Message,"This book articulates a simple yet powerful message: The most competitive people in society predict and adjust to change early. If there is something in the road a mile ahead, change lanes now. Otherwise, you might become part of a twelve-car pile up! The style of presentation is unique and the messsage is simple. This is why readers tend to either love the book or hate it."
1,Who is Making All the Bread,... It is written on a first grade level. I feel if the reasons for change are logically presented and employees have some input into the ways changes are made most people will adapt very well. Change for change's sake is not always good.
1,a miracle of marketing with little substance,"This is a slim volume, containing a fable within a story (i.e. a lot of verbal packaging). Bottom line message is that if you want to survive you need to be flexible ... This was not explored or elaborated in any detail beyond noting that a flexible approach will get cheese for a mouse in a maze. The group discussion ""wrapper"" around the fable appeared to be barely edited notes from a consulting session and carried no further enlightenment on the subject. A much more interesting story is how you get to publish such a management science best seller with so little content."
3,Required to know,"This book is the businees Best Seller for long time. If you are in the business, or management field, or even MBA student, you are required to know this book. It is a very good story with perfect characters. Nobody can denies the ideas and lessons of the book. Because they are so obvious. Also, it is true that you see Hem and Haw, Sniff and Scurry characters around you all the time. What makes this book so popular, because it is very simple and fun. You can read the entire book less than a hour. Read this essential book and joined the endless discussion of Change. And I wish you good luck to find your Cheese, if you have one!!"
1,Complete and Utter Pablum,"Don't neglect the utility of this book! When your manager hands this out, mark it down as a red-letter day. Years later, you can look back on it and say, ""This is when my company crossed the line from common, every day idiocy to stupidity of truly titanic proportions.""So, when your manager hands you this book, you can translate ""this is a book about accepting change"" as ""this is a thinly veiled effort to get you to willingly submit to the next reorg/round of layoffs/drastic, arbitrary change"".Those who love this book praise its use of a simple, parable-like allegory to convey its point. More rational observers would realize that it insults the intelligence of adults to believe that a book about mice is the best way to make a point. The people who pass out this book lack either the good sense to realize this, or the courage to present their employees with the truth.Save your cash folks -- this thing isn't worth 14 cents, much less the ... the publisher wants for it."
1,A little too slick for me,"I found this book to be glib and paternalistic. The reason so many companies bought this book for their employees is that upper management wants to encourage that ""sheep"" mentality among their employees. So much easier for them when the worker bees are compliant! I disliked this book so much that I actually resented throwing away 20 minutes or so of my life to read it."
3,Borrow This One or Get It From the Library,"This book deals with change and how we respond to it. Told in a parable format and short enough to read in about 45 minutes, I thought this book provided worthwhile lessons on dealing with change in life. Worthwhile read, but for entertainment purposes only.I got this book when it was the ""corporate fad"" and couldn't be handed out fast enough. Many books like this take on the life of a fad and people believe it is a new answer to the same ""self help"" questions they keep asking themselves every day year after year. This book is entertaining to read, but one should finish the book asking themselves if it fits their life.---**** THE BOTTOM LINE ****---1. Borrow it - even at a $12 price tag.2. It takes about 45 minutes to an hour to read at a comfortable pace.3. Small book, large typeface, lots of white space, less than 100 pages."
1,"Even if you win the rat race, you're still just a rat","The analogy of mice and little people trapped in a maze is a sadly accurate, insulting, and condescending one. An unintentional commentary on the fuedal system that is corporate America. So the moral of the story is, the powerless need to stop whining and accept whatever those in power choose to do to them. Don't think. Don't question. Don't hope.Don't buy this book."
3,A useful beginning book on change,"This short book starts with a story to help people understand that change is natural in the Information Age and how to best deal with it.Rather than being a victim, one learns to anticipate change and to even embrace it.This book is best suited for those just learning about change in their lives. For more sophisticated discussions about change, one will want to look for meatier sources.Another good point is that since this is told through a story, people are less likely to feel attacked by the story and what it teaches compared to someone telling them that they're wrong and need to change their lives."
1,What happened to sympathy?,"The message from this books is: If you are stupid and have no individual thought processes, you will survive in the corporate world. If you have feelings, morals, and care about your fellow man, you could very well lose your job, or your cheese.It is a pretty sad state of affairs when the message of today's corporate world is look out for yourself!No one else matters! Don't be loyal to the organization because the organization doesn't care a hoot about you!I can't reccommend this book."
4,Laugh at Your Own Resistance to Change,"Having lived through about a dozen reorganizations - either new management, acquisition or reverse take-over, I know first hand the issues businesses face in implementing change. I've also recommended this book to colleagues in order to give them a sense of perspective during such chaotic and turbulent times. The book makes us laugh at ourselves and the way we humans behave. Christine Brown-Quinn, The Female Capitalist (TM), Author of ""Step Aside Super Woman""."
4,Clever book on dealing with change,"In the world, we are dealing with incredible amounts and speed of change. This book through its clever story gives some good ideas on how to deal with change. Some of the reviewers have faulted the book on being overly simplistic, but I believe that is where its value is. The book is not a boring diatribe that few can get through, but instead a short story that most anyone can get through."
1,Great reading--If you're 12!,"This book contains some of the most banal prose I've ever read. The book reads for a sixth-grade reading level. Then there's the obvious theme: accept change. After living in the real world for the past 20+ years, who doesn't know that s/he must accept change? I'm saddened, because of the high sales of this book, to wonder about the literacy level of many managers."
1,Who Moved My Cheese- Skip it!,"The book seems geared for children, maybe teenagers. The message is simple, the world doesn't owe you anything, well duh! I would be mad if a supervisor gave me this book, and any company that has handed it out, needs to make some changes of their own. A much better book is Leap by Rick Smith, check it out."
1,A kid's book that office managers forced us to read,"This would be a great book for an elementary school class to read for some light homework. The fact that thousands of US corporations bought up this book in bulk and required their employees to read it shows how dumbed-down America has become, and what low regard office management holds its employees.That's the only reason it was a #1 bestseller for almost 2 years, it became the trendy thing for office managers to do, then onto the next management 101 fad. Read the other reviews, over and over again it was an assigned book!There's nothing in this book that any adult shouldn't already know."
4,"Good, but borrow it if you can instead of buying it.","There's a small dinnertime story in this book which is valuable for most prople who are going through change in their lives, be it in the home or on the job. However, there is not much meat and the book is way overpriced for the amount of material that it presents.This also sounds a lot like ""corporate brainwashing"". Ie. if your boss needed you to accept a change, he might give you this book.Mr Johnson presents the picture that we are all ""mice"" running around in a maze where someone else/inevitable situations move your goals/money/cheeze around.Luckily I borrowed the book at a library and did not buy it, cos I would have regretted buying it. I also asked my wife to read it.Recommendation: It is a good book. Read it with your mind open. Borrow it if you can."
2,Cheese? Oh please.....,"Somewhat entertaining overview of the rat-race as we know it. The message ""Who Moved My Cheese"" sells is ""Pay attention and Adapt"" Around my office, people seem to read this book just to be able to discuss it with others who've read it.Could have just as easily written a book called, ""How to take a novel five-minute dinner story and turn it into a boring, drawn-out, condescendingly irritating book."" My recommendation: Borrow it and save your $."
1,It's a pity to call this boys tale a book,"People are not mice. They can not be prompted by cheese. If what this tale wants to support is that a worker always must be profitable and his past services are not worthy any longer, that is not new nowdays. Each one must try to update his knowledge everyday to be profitable, but the company also bears some responsability. It's easy to get the maximun outcome from people, not investing on them in their training on new tools and years later discover that the worker is outdated. Then simply replace them for ""updated ones"". It's so easy, but at least do not blame on them as lazy ""little men"". Not to mention the application on private lives. Must I replace my wife if she is not wearing sport shoes?."
1,"Its a joke, right?","I think this book must be a hoax. The basic premise is so thin it could have been written in a single page. To fatten the book into handbill size, the margins and type are nearly right for those who won't use their reading glasses and print notes beside their favorite passages. A great book for lazy thinkers and non-readers who want to claim to have read a book."
3,Shows the pitfalls of complacency and the liberating...,"effects of embracing the concepts of change, development and curiosity. This is particularly true insofar as career and financial well being are concerned.Although it seems to me that the lessons being taught within should be readily apparent to any student of history and even more currently anyone who has lived through the downsizing revolution and the transition from the industrial age to the age of service and technology.The sad thing is that the truths expressed within are elementary and adults shouldn't need to have a childrens story approach with regard to these teachings.If people were actually paying attention to the world they live in a book like this wouldn't even sell a single copy.Wake up!"
1,Pretty Pictures But No Instructions,"Every person that reviewed this book said it is a must have book. Well, I thought I was ordering the perfect book. If you just want pictures it is perfect, but for someone that needs instructions on how to sew window treatments this is not the book. There are no directions at all. Now I have a lovely book of pictures and still don't know how to make any of the window treaments in the book. What a disappointment."
1,Which Pernox to use?,"What is the difference in the 4 oz tube of Pernox and the 5 oz bottle of Pernox Lotion? They both say scrub, but the bottled one has ""lotion"" tacked on. Which one of these products is everyone using?"
4,Lovely Roses,"A great primmer for the care of rose bushes. This book provides many tips; how to combat pest problems, proper irrigation, and pruning. An easy read..."
1,Disappointed,This was so cheap! I was embarrassed for my friend to see it when he started to put it together!! My three year old grandson thought it was a playhouse. So misrepresented!
2,"Gorgeous, but...","I was torn between giving a two star or a three star rating... Yes, the patterns in this book each and every one are absolutely gorgeous BUT choice on sizing absolutely sucks. I am a good knitter, but cannot rewrite a pattern myself. Therefore, not a single clothing pattern worked for me. My daughter fell in love with the ballet top but I cannot make it for her because she isn't a size 2/3 or 4/5, the ONLY choices.Highly anticipated and equally disappointing... just because I'm big doesn't mean I don't want to knit and wear something gorgeous. It's being returned."
5,"Easy to install, good value","I installed this filter in our BlueAir 403 in just two minutes. After removing the old filter and vacuuming out the interior per instructions I slid this new filter in the slot, aligning the arrows as directed. It is a snug, perfect fit which allows for maximum filter efficiency. Although not inexpensive, this filter, and the system in total has vastly improved the air quality in our bedroom. The plastic-wrapped filter was packaged in a rigid cardboard box which was then placed in a large shipping box; there was not a wrinkle in it. BlueAir filters are advertised to be environmentally friendly, decomposing into carbon dioxide and water which was a plus."
4,The pictures swing this book into action!,"We just love the cheerful and happy illustrations that make this a really meaningful Judith Viorst book. Here, the beautiful pictures' exuberant humor, joy, and color add another dimension, almost another story, to a tale of how different 2 sisters and a brother can be. They really do embody ""the genuine spirit of animation, the breathing to life, the swing into action,"" that Maurice Sendak says he considers ""an essential quality in pictures for children's books"" in ""Caldecott & Co.,"" his book of essays on books and pictures. In fact, the pictures are so wonderful that you should look at the charming, wordless books Robin Preiss Glasser, the illustrator of ""Super-Completely,"" has made with her sister: ""You Can't Take a Balloon Into The Metropolitan Museum"" and ""You Can't Take a Balloon Into The National Gallery."""
4,nice space saver in kitchen,"easy to handle, saves room, only need one instead of several different sizes, perfect for anyone doing a lot of cooking"
3,Graphic SF Reader,"A young bloke has a destiny to be a hero type, complete with tiger warrior companion and babe pirate type to look after his amulet of power.Throw in a turtle wizard, an evil dark lord kid, some opposition bad guy warrior types, and some hilarious frog soldiers, and you have a aimed at the young audience fantasy adventure that isn't too bad.Even has dragons, griffins and frog shadow ninja."
1,horrible,after a a few months of use the bottle startred to leak oil and the cap broke on the inside. i was mad and threw it in the garbage.
3,pepper mill,I purchased this mill for a person with arthritis who was having difficulty using a hand powered mill. I purchased a salt mill at the same time and am very happy with the salt mill. I am satisified with the performance of the pepper mill but an disapointed at the rate it uses up batteries. I'd seen the reviews and knew that batteries would be a problem. The first 6 aaa's lasted less than a month. Suggestion - what about a rechargable?
4,Works great.,"Took a bit of help to figure out how to assemble, and it is way too tall. Just fits in our cabinet."
4,Great gift for those cooking enthusiasts,"For the price, this is a good buy. Very convenient that it comes with peppercorns. Not very thrilled about the fact that it uses so much much batteries!"
4,Really like this pepper mill,"Great peppermill. Works great - exactly like I expected. Just two minor negatives...it could hold more peppercorns, and it is not real easy to refill since you have to take it apart from the bottom. If it had been refillable from the top, I'd give it 5 stars."
5,Outstanding,"This is definitely for the lazy person. You simply turn the pepper mill upside down and you have your pepper. It's easy to adjust the grind size, too. I simply love it."
3,Works well but grinds slowly,"Grinder works just fine. In my opinion, it's a bit slow and takes much more time than a manual pepper mill. For those using this to mill a good amount of pepper per use, you might grow impatient."
1,Minnella's guide to photo copiers and fax machine(6 edition),i just want to know the price of the book given above and the purpose of the book.
1,Total Nonsense,"The conspiracy theorists have been hard at work with this book. The evil scenario hypothesized here is ludicrous and would require the cooperation of tens of thousands of health care professionals for many decades. None of the author's claims hold up. Meanwhile, community water fluoridation has been providing safe and effective protection against dental decay. Children have never better oral health than they do now, thanks to the benefits of fluoride."
5,Sandy Denny,Excellent remastering from vinyl to digital. The additional tracks are a welcome plus - the solo version of Like and Old Fashioned Waltz taken from a BBC broadcast complements the studio version nicely. And her Until the Real Thing Comes Along is the best version of this old chestnut since Fats Waller's.
1,Genisoy Soy Nuts,I ordered this product based on Nutrition Facts posted on the website. The facts on the packages are different - specifically:Calories - Web 120 / Package 130Total Fat - Web 4g / Package 6gDietary Fiber - Web 5g / Package 2gI'm very disappointed by the discrepancy between the web presentation and the actual product.
3,"Big performance, bigger price, even bigger heat.","Good performance, 8800 Ultra line is pretty solid even still.The downside to these cards is the price, and the ABSOLUTELY ABSURD amount of heat they generate. If you do not intend to go with a aftermarket cooling solution (waterblock) be prepared for one or both of them to turn themselves into a very expensive paperweight after awhile under heavy load.nVidia as usually is pretty spotty on drivers. SLI generally is...troublesome at best to get functioning properly for some or most games."
3,Ok but dated,"The worship maze is a good primer for those getting into the topic of worship styles. The author does a good job making people aware of important elements viewed from specific faith traditions and the logic behind their approaches. I found that the author was more informative and accurate regarding traditions that have an extended history such as liturgical, revivalist and traditional. Some more contemporary elements discussed are very dated and it is obvious the text needs to be updated to reflect changes in worship styles over the past twenty years ie. nothing about emergent, praise and worship is considered part of ""pentecostal"" phenomena which it clearly is not. Overall the author writes simply and descriptively to get some key points for further research. There are better titles out there that discuss more recent approaches. A fair, evenhanded work with some flaws."
4,"Annie, Honey, Go Git Yo' Pistola & Sing","The CD has surprises. Tom Wopat can really sing---on key. And Bernadette Peters is the sexiest Annie Oakley, this side of Calamity Jane. Her vocals stand up to the past 20th Century Annies of Betty Mutton, Mary Martin, and Ethel Murmur. The updated CD sound is crisp, and the silly outdated Indian tom-tom songs (like, ""I'm An Indian, Too"") are thankfully eliminated. If you don't like soundtrack, at least you can gawk at Bernadette Peters' CD cover portrait."
5,"Reinventing ""Annie,"" Peters is Brilliant","If, like I did, you grew up listening to the Ethel Merman recording of this incredible show, track one of this CD will enthrall you. By the time you reach the end of this superb recording of the 1999 Broadway Revival, the only question in your mind will be ""Ethel Merman? Who's that?"" Bernadette Peters took a role forever associated with Merman, and didn't simply recreate it, she stole it. Reclaiming Annie Oakley for Broadway and the world, future generations will remember this show with Ms. Peters' name attatched. Perhaps Merman can still be remembered for a little show called ""Gypsy,"" but Annie will be Peters' territory from the moment you hear her sing."
2,Infinite bore!,"Highsmith's Ripley series is charming, intelligent and, most of the time, thrilling. However, this is a clearly dissonant note: ""The Boy..."" never reaches the surprising heights (or depths) of psychological insights of her earlier books. It lacks rhythm and consistency and its characters are not less than unbearable. In one word, this book is a terrible bore!"
4,JESSICA DOES IT AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The only flaw in this book, which was pretty good, was Jessica. I like her sometimes, but most of the time she just acts like she doesn't have a brain, like in this book. Well, the book was pretty good, anyway."
4,NOT realistic AT ALL...,"okay, i'm about to graduate from 7th grade and let me tell you, this is NOT the real way it works. maybe it's just that my experience is different, but it seems more like high school or something. however most of the stuff in the earlier SVH/SVT/etc. series' ys unrealistic anyway, and it's still entertaining nonetheless. I prefer the more modern Sweet Valley books though =)"
5,I give funimation credit,"In Tokyo of the future, there's major crime issues around every corner. Kyohei Tachibana is a student at a culinary arts school, with dreams of someday becoming a pastry chef. The next step is to travel to France for some studying, but there's just one problem. HE CAN""T AFFORD IT AHHHH! Instead of giving up his goal he gets a part-time job as a cook to four girls."
3,Good toy with one huge flaw,"The Positive: The dog loves the sound these make...although your neighbors will not. It's loud, high pitched, and sounds like it's dying. Good for the dog though.The Negative: Every creature in the lineup has some sort of rubber piece that the dog will snap off within 30 minutes. The elephant has a trunk; the dragon has a tongue; the octopus has tentacles, etc.Trust me: These do not last long if your dog is moderately curious (40 pound Basenji mix here). But...they are fun while they last :)"
3,Way to small,The picture makes it look bigger than it is. Think it's to much money for the size it is. It's for really small dogs.
2,Blown seam,The kids loved it...until the seam blew out...no way to fix it. Lasted a few days. Very sad kids.
4,O.K. game,"This game brought some stuff from the movie. The Graphies are bad,the story good, and the script and the vocie work Good!! Rent, see if you like it. If you do, buy it."
3,Formal versus Normal,"I bought this Japanese Bible for a Japanese friend. Her English would be considered ""Intermediate"". After reading part of Matthew she told me the Japanese is of the older, more formal style. She sometimes had to refer to the English to understand the Japanese (remember: she is Japanese). I read part of the English and it is excellent for someone who is learning English.The Japanese Scripture translation should have been a simpler one."
4,Cheap alternative to food saver electrical appliances,"I've used this product for about 3-4 years now and it shows no sign of wearing out. It works quite well for vacuum sealing in jars but not so well in bags. It is still available on its own web site (do a search) for about $30. The advantages are that it takes little storage space, is lightweight, and cheap. See [...] for some instructions on how to make your own seals. I have 2 - 1 in my office to vacuum seal coffee and 1 at home. I've taken it on trips as it packs easily. It is not hard to use and is actually faster than using the electrical appliances. I could not get a seal using a ziplock bag so I don't recommend it for that. But then, I'm trying to store as little as possible in plastic (chemical leaching, ya know) so the jars are better anyway."
3,Not for the faint-hearted.,"This book is almost unreadable. Without a solid background in literary theory, deconstruction, death of god theology, Heidegger, Nietszche and other postmodern methodologies and persons, the words used are too big, too abstract, and too specialized to make any sense to a general readership. I sense that Winquist has something relevant to say, but it's going to take me quite a while to get a grip on the language. Winquist's co-edited 'Encyclopedia of Postmodernism' would be minimum background reading before even thinking of getting into Epiphanies. Perhaps the reason Death of God Theology never took off was because nobody could understand what it was saying !"
3,Old memories,This album brings back old memories of the days when Tanya was a rising star. Simple songs for in a happier time. .
1,Advertisement for Kolman,"I bought this book because of my interest in the subject.Ze'ev Kolman may be a wonderful healer. I have no first-hand experience of him so I cannot comment on that.However, I was very turned off by the writing of Hans Holzer.The book reads like an infomercial.I wanted information; instead I got a very long and not terribly useful advertisement for Kolman.We are informed how to contact him for healing at very high prices.Actually, there are many wonderful healers out there. I have worked with some of them or met them. They are people of integrity in most cases.None of them commissions a book to hawk themselves like a product in the marketplace.This book does a disservice to Mr. Kolman if, indeed, he is as great as Holzer claims."
3,What the...?,"Well, I Really wanted to like this book. In fact, I gave it 5 stars even before I finished it. But then I after I had read the whole thing I had to change my rating because I was so disappointed. There was no good wallop at the end that brought tears to my eyes, etc, etc. How did Imogen find out about Rafe? There was never any indication she knew what was going on. She wasn't Ticked Off that she'd been tricked? Mr. Spencer & Miss Pythian-Adams' romance was almost better. Don't get me wrong, now. The first 3/4 of the was pretty good, but then, WHAM! it's completely concluded in about two paragraphs. Oh well, you can't have a stunner every time. I still love Eloisa James."
5,loved the story,"I absolutely loved the story of how Rafe and Imogen finally got together after their love/hate relationship from the previous books. I enjoyed reading and seeing in minds eye the transformation of these two for the better.I thought it clever to have Rafe in disguise of his brother Gabe to see how far things would progress with Imogen, if she really was intent on making Gabe her lothario, or if she really had it in her to face the fact that she was falling in love with Rafe."
3,Was the Duke tamed,"I have read some of the other reviews and I do agree. More should have been told about how Imogen felt about Rafe. Your are left guessing about her feelings, and for that matter Gillian's. You got the idea she liked Gabe but not till near the end. More romance should have been involved with both Imogen and Rafe and with Gabe and Gillian. Some parts were to formal for a romance novel. Here is another question? Did Annabel ever have her baby?"
4,Chuscales is the real thing,"Comparing Chuscales to Jesse Cook or Oscar Lopez is an unbelievable insult on many levels. First, out of the three, Chusco is the only real flamenco guitarist. Second, as a guitarist, his technique and tone are far superior.For someone to write that his traditional flamenco has no rhythm is laughable... perhaps the rhythm of flamenco is too complex for this person to grasp the beat. What is boring is an entire CD of rumba rhythm with the flamenco name.If you are ever in Santa Fe during the summer, do yourself a favor and catch Chuscales live. You will be amazed by his abilities."
4,Pretty Food for Thought,"This book is a very good introduction into herbs and flowers that can be eaten as well as used medicinally or as garden plants.It is very basic, and will be of little use to the experienced herb gardener or kitchen herbalist. There are about five paragraphs of information for each of the 50 herbs listed; background, how to grow, how to use, top choices, and hints and tips.Where I found this book excellent is the colored photographs and the Latin names make plant identification very easy. Basic information for drying, candying, and other means of preservation and propagation is included, and there is a zone map and an excellent index.Beautiful in its simplicity, this is a very good starter book, and recommended as such."
3,Get the original hardcover,"I just received a couple of paperback versions of The Boy, Me, and the Cat. I was disappointed that the paperback doesn't include the delightful drawings and photographs that are included in the hardcover copy (Fifth Printing, 1989 and copyrighted 1961). It is amazing how inferior the paperback feels. I love the writing and the story, but the drawings are precious. Get the hardcover with the drawings."
5,What A Powerful Read,"Laurie Hunter-Gilbert did an awe-inspiring job in writing her story ""I Just Want To Testify."" This was a very powerful read as the author conversantly writes to her readers about her love battles, life struggles and hurt of loosing love ones. But, the terrific part about this book she also tells the readers what she learned and how she grew through every experience she endured; more so she's not ashamed to reveal the mistakes she made as many of us have buried ours. I recommend every woman and man to click on the purchase button now, you will find that there's something everyone can gain from reading this book. Don't allow yourself to miss out on a treat, because it's non-fiction and you are accustomed to reading fiction. You will not be able to put it down once you start reading."
3,A False Language Workbook,"""Sentence Structure"" should help us become familiar with English morphology. Nigel Fabb addresses those who are still unaware of terms like 'sentence', 'noun', 'article', 'adjective' etc. And still, the book is ambivalent. On the one hand, it is a false language workbook. I personally deal with morphology in four other languages, but I doubt that a newcomer would easily find his way here; Moreover, about half of the tasks included in this book do not have an answer key. On the other hand, 20 pages out of 104 are dedicated to comparative sentence structure in Korean, Madi, Malay, Tamil etc.Before publishing the next edition of this book, I think that the editor should take a painful decision:(a) Is this a course in comparative morphology?(b) Is this a language workbook?I think that in 104 pages one is too ambitious to try and do both.Raluca Zakheim, MA Comp. Lit, Israel"
2,Didn't like the start of the plot,"Brianne is asked to return to Griffin's time with the knowledge that his wife, Florence, would die of a miscarriage and then they would die just before their own wedding. She goes back in time hoping to change things. Her cousin Florence is such a nice devoted wife but shy of her wifely duties. Griffin is fond of her so they can't act on their love for each other behind her back but we have to read about their going without each other until she dies. I couldn't enjoy such a plot. Then we have a flu epidemic, his saving captured slaves, and a villian's revenge."
5,The Truth At Last!,"As the parent of two adopted children, I would like to commend the authors of ""A Peacock or a Crow"" on their uplifting view of Romanian adoptions. The book is well written, easy to read and full of information. I feel that so far all that has been published is negative information, if only for the reason that it attracts more attention. I would strongly urge any parent of internationally adopted children or anyone considering international adoption to read this book first! Romanian adoption is not, as some would have us believe, all gloom and doom."
5,Love it!,"I just purchased my first road bike used, and the decade old tape that came with the bike was damaged and had seen better days. I purchased this tape in Carbon Black, and couldn't be happier. It made the bike look so much better, and feels absolutely wonderful! I am new to cycling, so I really can't compare from tape to tape, but I don't think I will be buying anything different since there is such a large color selection, and I have absolutely no regrets about this purchase. Definitely recommended!"
5,A treasure trove of insight into the western esotericism,"Interesting how a modest historian should happen to write a book of such critical interest to students and practicioners of the western esoteric traditions. Sheds enourmously penetrating light, especially in the first part of the book, into the people and historical events that shaped the powerful undergound traditions of independent spiritual philosophy-- what we now know as Magick or Magic, both high and low, alchemy, illuminisms of various sorts, and the whole spectrum of western metaphysics."
5,My baby loves this stuff!,"I was looking for an alternative to fruit juice for my son as a treat. I bought some of these for him to try. He's 10 months old and totally inhaled them. Problem is, I can't find them locally--I have to get them on Amazon!"
1,Careful with this one....,"This is the kind of thing that really burns me with CD reissues. Amazon offers a $4.99 version of this issued in 2009 on the label ""SBME Special Markets"". The sound quality was awful, and I kicked myself for buying a budget version when an outside seller was offering the original 1999 CD on the original RCA label for $18. I figured that one had to be closer to the original sound than a budget knock-off, so I bought it. It is exactly the same CD. Shame on Amazon.com for printing misleading label information and leading people to believe there are various versions of CDs available when in fact there is only one. The music is terrific, but if you're looking here, you already know that."
3,pulse stomp odyssey,used in music class after studing sound. Students love stomp and this just as good. It shows music from around the world. It comes with an online lesson plan that follows the CD.
2,Not what the name implies,"When you think stomp, you think high tempo, creative ways to make music. This is more like the roots of stomp, folklore music. It's ok-- but not what I envisioned by the title."
5,Great Rugged Tow Truck,"My son loves this truck - it is durable, works great on carpet, wooden floor and he enjoys playing with it in his sand box as well! Well worth the money spent on it!!"
1,Don't buy this,"This tow truck is awful, one of the worst toys I have ever seen. The truck comes apart too easily, and doesn't attach to the car (being towed) well. All I hear from my son when he plays with this toy is , ""I need help! I need help"" and I have to constantly put it back together again. I am considering throwing it out."
4,Very good,"Even though this is Sandy's first solo effort, she was far from a novice at this point. Having been in the Strawbs, Fairport Convention, and Fotheringay, she had pretty well demonstrated she had the chops and talent to venture out on her own. Still, this album features most of her Foteringay alumni, so in many places it sounds like Fotheringay II. It has more of a folky feel than her later albums (in fact my favorite is the lone traditional ""Blackwaterside""). With songs like ""Down In The Flood"" and ""Let's Jump The Broomstick"", she began to stretch out.I like this one a lot, but think that her next two efforts (""Sandy"" and ""Like An Old Fashioned Waltz)compell me more. But having Richard Thompson playing throughout, you really can't go wrong. The bonus tracks are good, too--especially the rocking ""Walking The Floor Over You"".Overall: recommended, 4 stars."
4,The best post Fairport,"I am going to say what no one else wants to- after Sandy left Fairport (Liege n Lief), she was just never the same on vinyl. The Fotheringay album was interesting, promising, as was her effort with Fairport when she rejoined (despite Glynnis Johns putrid, pop style production). But compare that stuff to her work on ""What We Did on Our Summer Holidays"", or just listen to her sing Genesis Hall on ""Unhalfbricking"". Her voice went downhill- why, who knows? Probably drinking, smoking (I actually don't know if she smoked), having a good time, etc. You can't be 21 forever you know. All that said, I love this album. There was something about Sandy, a style, a presence, the way she could deliver a song when she was at her best, that is still unmatched. She was the real thing, the genuine article, and the material on this album is the best match of songs to her style that she ever got (at least on vinyl) after Liege n Lief."
5,The Book of Household Management,This book is a real gem to have - thankfully I did not live in that era.A delight to read and actually has some good old world advice and recipes. In a number of cases it made my really laught and a great book to talk over with friends.
4,Another Nas delivery!,"Another track from Nas that doesn't excel at anything he's done before. Yes, Nas has dope lyrics and a super-tight flow... but this track sounds too much like his acclaimed ""Illmatic"" debut. Typical ego boosting rhymes laced with star studded production is all you'll get from ""Nas Is Like"". DJ Premier gets the nod for this one."
4,Very good cd and i`am glad its Heavy as F#%K !!!!!,What can i say about this Great band and rocking cd ? GREAT JOB BOYS !!!!!!!!!!!
2,vailtrail.com/ weekly shuffle/ CD Review by Samantha Donen,"SevenDust, NextSevenDust's fifth album, Next, is a disappointment, a somewhat supercharged power rock album that fizzles out like a discount firecracker. Next begins, back to back, with heavy hits ""Hero,"" ""Ugly,"" and ""Pieces,"" and should have carried on from there (or the band should have just made a three-song EP). The melodic and slow songs entailing the rest of the 11-track album are boring in comparison, and all sound alike. If I wanted to hear a boring rock album, I would have bought Default. As the name implies, wait for the ""next"" album. Web link: [...]"
4,good book,"Interesting book; it gives useful insights in how to teach.Low information density though, it could have been more focused.Nevertheless, it's easy to read and informative in general."
3,Report on Recent Research,"Mr. Bain's book reviews his continuing study into what makes a good colledge teacher. However, after finishing the book, you are still left puzzling over the ultimate description of a good teacher. His research indicates that various excellent professors utlize differing techniques to both interest and enthrall their students, but there is little in the way of common threads that can be pointed to with certainty. The central message is that good teachers create an enthusiastic desire to learn, act more as helpmates than teachers, and manage to convey the feeling to their students that they can all not only succeed, but excel. Perhaps trying to define a good teacher is akin to defining good art--you either responed enthusiastically or you don't."
1,Extremely vague,"This book presents itself as a serious source of ideas for becoming an effective college progessor. However, it is extremely vague to say the least. The author indicates that it is the product of 15 years of research but no serious data are provided; it's all anecdotal. For a better coverage of effective college teaching read ""Saints and Scamps"" by Steven Cahn, which is shorter and far deeper in its coverage."
3,Fair but not Good for Multi-section courses,"While I found Bain's book interesting, I came away from it with little useful material. The book mainly deals how instructors develop and teach single section courses for interested individuals. However, my teaching world is the antithesis of those course.I teach in mathematics in a community college where the material covered is defined and the students are at best neutral to the subject matter. However, the students are required to take the course before they can start their desired curriculum. I foundHow to Teach Mathematicsa far more useful book. It deals with exactly the problems I face and presents multiple solutions from different educational philosophies by advocates of those views."
5,The Courage to Grieve,"Great for lay people. It covers everything. It even treats life after the death of the loved one really well. It's short on the spiritual aspects of grief, but then that is not its purpose. I will recommend it to bereavement group members."
3,comfy butthey wear out fast,"I wear slippers quite a bit at home instead of shoes or socks. At least for just lounging around. These are quite comfy, and they do keep you warm. The only issue I had was the liner started to peel back inside one of the slippers up by the toes and wore down to the rubber within 2 months. Granted, that is 2 months of daily wear, but still, I expect them to last at least 6 months. So based on your wear needs and use level, you can determine just how good these will be for you. Biggest issue - I want the hi-top type slipper and for men this is difficult to find. I mean, what's the point of a slipper if 1/2 your foot is open to the cold!! And in Wisconsin, it gets COLD!!Good luck."
1,Chemical smell...Made in China = Nervous!!,"These sneakers feel good and are warm. However, I'm very concerned with the materials and checmicals their made from. With the many disasterous products coming out of China. I have never smelt anything like this and its still so strong, months after my purchase. How might we have this tested??"
1,Di,They have a very narrow toe area and my instep is to high for the opening. I was scared of tearing the stitching out putting them on.
3,"Too tight, too small, too bad.","Really nice feel and look, but dang these things are WAY small. I took the review advice and went for a full size larger (12 instead of 11), but I should have also gone for an ""overwidth"". The amount of shearling inside the boot eats up at least a full width and length size. Only trouble is, once that stuff is tamped down, you'll probably be swimming in the things. Then it would be time to buy another pair (one year later). Could be that's the whole marketing ploy in the first place. Couldn't wear 'em......just too darn tight. Go big (full size more, length and width) and you should be okay. Just going over length wont' cut it."
3,Missized width,"I ordered a size larger, due to the warning in another review. That worked fine. However, I also ordered their ""EEE"" width, and the slipper is just normal width (sole marked ""W""). I made a stretcher to widen it, and now it fits fine.The slipper seems of good quality, and is warm enough."
5,Wonderful!,"Very warm, exactly what I was looking for. I bought 2 pair and now, 1 year later, I'm buying another pair."
4,Slippers run small,"Luckily I read the other reviews before I order my pair of slippers. I normally wear a size 9 and I bought a size 11 and they are a little snug with socks on. Otherwise they are comfortable and warm. I know in time I will stretch them out, so I am happy iwth my purchase. They are good looking slipper the only issue is getting the size right."
4,Interesting mystery!,"This is the third Lawrence Sanders book I've read and I enjoyed it. The investigator is a likeable guy, the story is suspenseful and the characters are very real. Most of Sanders' lead characters have a cheeky, kind of sarcastic/funny way about them that's drawing me to his writing. Humor and suspense - a rare combination that is refreshing. Some of the medical terminology was too detailed, but otherwise a good, quick read."
2,"Merry Christmas, Ho! Ho! Ho! Reissued","~ This CD is simply Lou's classic Christmas recording of 1967 re-packaged and re-issued. Except this time they left off two tracks. Although the music here is great, the two star rating is because you can get more music with better sound by going to the great Lou Rawls Christmas CDMerry Christmas Babyfrom 2006. That CD contains all 11 tracks from ""Merry Christmas, Ho! Ho! Ho!"" plus nine more tracks. See my complete review of that CD here on Amazon."
4,Eat in Season,Simply In Season (World Community Cookbook)I purchased this book after seeing it at a sustainable agriculture conference. It has some great recipes for eating foods that are in season.
5,All I can say is Oh My Goodness!,"I purchased this book knowing somewhat about this princess from hearing about her on Oprah. As I read the book, I couldn't believe that women were so oppressed in Saudi Arabia. The sexual prowess of the men is so accepted, while the women are treated as possessions. I would like to think that things have changed in this area, but am not naive enough to truly believe that. Princess Sultana, wheter an actual character or a combination of many, is truly a tribute to women in her country. May her quest for equality and freedom from oppression be successful."
3,The first book in the series isn't too bad but leave it at that,"I read the first book and was appalled (although not surprised) at the treatment of women even within the wealthiest of households in Saudi Arabia. In fact, I read all 3 (because my Kindle makes it easy to just keep going!) - and by the time I got to the end of the trilogy and found the tone so saccharin and phony that I couldn't finish the third book. Princess Sultana emerges as a spoiled princess with an artificial sense of her own enlightenment."
5,A MUST FOR ALL WHO ARE INTERSTED IN HUMAN RIGHTS,"I read this book about three years ago and I thought that it really described the princess' life. I could not believe some of the stuff that she had to go through. I brought the book without knowing what it was about and have read it again about three times! I have read both sequels to it and thought they they were as enthralling as this book. The princess herself is not a perfect Muslim and she knows it, but still you feel for her. If you have any sense (and money! ) please buy it!"
3,Behind the Hype,"I give this book three stars solely for its entertainment value. It reeks of yellow journalism, thinly ""veiled"" racism, and schlock. If you really want to know about Arab Muslim women, take a trip to your local mosque and ask around. Most Arab women are treated royaly. I should know....I am one."
3,Interesting at first but. . .,"This book certainly exposes the hidden life of Saudi princesses. Initially, I was intrigued by her story and, at times, horrified at the treatment girls and women receive at the hands of male relatives. However, I started to get annoyed with this story in that the protagonist does nothing to alleviate her plight. I found it hard to have sympathy for someone describing her emotional hardships all the while having her feet massaged by a Phillipine, female servant. She is a self-described rebel but when it comes right down to it, she is unable or unwilling to unsettle the status quo. Now if she had taken action to improve the status of women, this would have turned into an extraordinary story. . .as it is, it is merely a cautionary tale"
5,Must read!,This book is incredible good! I read it all in one day. Couldnt put it down. Really opens up about what life is like for women in Saudi Arabia. Sultana is an opinionated women who must live a submissive lifestyle. It discusses about how she hopes to change the life for future Saudi Woman. This. Is. A. Must. Read.
4,"Jewels, clothes and wealth not worth this sacrifice","It is appalling that in this day of age, women are suffering such extreme oppression in Saudi Arabia. Women are treated as objects, yes, their men, if wealthy lavish jewels and clothes on them, but, their sacrifices are great. They have no freedom, not even in their own home. A female child born to a couple is an unfortunate event, at times, the infant is murdured because she was not born male. The circumstances in this country are shocking and this book shocks you into awareness."
4,Very worthy story! Buy it!,"The stories of this royal princess regarding women's lives in Saudi are shocking. What she has witnessed, learned and experienced is overwhelmingly distressing compared to America's generally good treatment of women. I shared it immediately, among my other office readers after, first, making my teen daughters read exerpts that I marked. All women should read it to be aware of the differences of female lives in countries that believe people are property. It truly educates on the different practice that women are private property versus those that are constitutionally held as equal citizens.Good for book clubs, high school English or college sociology classes. Highly recommend this book!"
3,True story? I don't think so!,"An ""OK"" story about 'Princess Sultana,' a real Saudi princess whose name was changed by the author to protect her identity. Book was written by Jean Sasson who used the diaries provided to her to show how Muslim women (and female children) are denied human rights. Some are tormented, beaten, raped and some have even been stoned to death.Some who've read this book claim the story was contrived. It seems to me that the author used a gimmick to tell her story. It seems unlikely that the real identity of this princess could be kept a secret. I mean c'mon!The writing is not that good but the shock factor is. Even if it really were just a novel it is based, in part, by some truth. Not for the faint of heart, in any case.I give it 2.5. I read it before I knew much about the subject......right around the first Gulf War."
2,try to study ISLAM..without fence.,"i read this book.i found that the auther isn't looking for the truth.because she did not use a sientific way in studying and searching.i'm looking for the truth..that means i should study the sociological,economical,and biological studies and relationships.i want women to get their rights but with RESPECT THE RELIGION.islam is different because i can't find a disagree or wrong orders..i studied sociologically islam..i respect it..and i want to be a good muslim one day..stop fighting islam because it has a good popularity ..i see peoples want to be muslims every day..sooner or later i would be a muslim .. if any body want to know about woman's rights in islam..it may i could answer it ."
2,too general,"I appreciate the efforts that went into this true story but, I found it too sketchy. I never felt as though I was there with the author. I was hoping there would be some other stories and facts from other women in the royal family. This is an ok book for someone that wants a quick read without much detail."
4,Living in Darkness,"I think this book was very informative of the women who live in Saudi Arabia. I had trouble putting this book down, yet I found myself horrified of thinking of what was going to happen to this princess next. Reading of how women are sold into marriage and having to obey the religious laws was shocking! After reading this book, you may realize that your life is not so bad."
5,So sad but true.,"This story was so educational, but at the same time so good. The story behind the veil is one that I will never forget. I learned so much, as I fell in love with Sultana and her prickly ways. This is a MUST MUST MUST read..for any woman or man. The book has many truths, some that are harder to imagine then other."
4,Another easy read... and happy ending,This author writes very well about early life in the US. All of her books add a romantic twist and usually have a happy ending.
3,Last Days of the Spanish Waltz,"These are actually a large range of colonial musical hybrid forms from Trinidad with the hypnotic, African stick fight rhythms surgically removed as to not spook the society dames and bow tied gents who went to the dances in old time Port of Spain. Listening to these tunes gives you that very pre-war, stride piano, jazz age, lets put a good show on for the yankees feeling. Yet, even with that wiff of cultural repression, this is an indispensible recording for anyone who can't bear to leave the missing links in Caribbean music un-collected. It is positively riveting, in a rubber necking sort of way, to hear accomplished Calypsonians doing everything from Spanish Waltzes, called paseos or pasillos locally, to Jack Teagarden and Bix Beiderbeck type ditties. Buy it just to gawk at the cross-cultural spectacle."
1,Horrible design,"This is a horrible design because its not sturdy. After putting my DVD's and Games in it, the cases was always was falling out when I removed a DVD or Game cases. When I needed to move the stand it broke."
2,Avoid this product if your goal is to put DVD's on it.,"I was sorely disappointed with this item. I knew it was cheap, but I did not know it was going to also be horrible at holding DVD's. It was pretty easy to assemble. Good luck trying to put DVD's on it and having them stay on there. The bottom lip of a ""shelf"" is SO SMALL that one minor, tiny bump to the shelf while placing a DVD on it, or removing one, will cause many, many to fall off. Once you spend a very painful amount of your time to fill the whole thing up, it gets a little better at holding them on there, but only because there are so many on there. Remove one the wrong way and boom, there you have many on the floor again. This would have been a MUCH better product if the lip of the ""shelf"" was say, at LEAST ONE INCH for the DVD to rest on. Two or three inches would have been a GENIUS of an idea. Oh well.. Final word: AVOID"
5,dvd rack,I gave this as a gift but since then I have checked with them and they are very pleased with this product.
1,cheap and ugly,"This item was very annoying. My roommate purchased it while in college. It was ugly, and fell over all the time, even though it was on a tile floor. It was hard to keep the dvd's standing up straight. In my opinion a worthless piece of plastic. Spend the extra money for a bookshelf style dvd holder. You will be glad you did."
3,spend the extra few dollars,"Seriously. This shelf is easy to set up, holds the DVDs and DVD box sets I put on it. HOWEVER, it's a pain in the butt to put the DVD's onto the shelves. There are these annoying little ledges that they have to rest on, otherwise they sit all cockeyed. It also seems that the stand will topple over any minute. I would recommend spending the extra 5-10 dollars on a better one, in the long run it will be worth saving you the inconvenience."
1,NO,Too many pieces to put together. Not what I had expected. Did not look strong enought to hold DVD's. Looked good in the picture.
2,not what I expected!!,"This I suppose would work great for someone who had time to assemble it but for me there were to many pieces!! Sorry, otherwise, mailing was fast!!"
3,Not Up To Shane,"I watched this movie last night and though a good family movie with very good actors and actress, it reminded me too much of Shane. The story was about a fathers love for his son and what he would do to restore his sons voice. I thought this was a little overdone, but that is just my opinion. Olivea de Havilland plays the female rancher who comes to love them both. I am a romantic so like happy endings and was not dissapointed. A good movie for the time you want a family movie for all ages. Don't expect it to have the power of Shane."
2,A Little Background Would Have Worked Better,"I found myself really confused about the premise of this novel. Like the person before me I had to let it go 3/4 of the way through. Was it really necessary to set this in the future? I didn't even realize that it was meant to be futuristic until I got to chapter 2 and found myself pretty mixed up about some of the terminology. What exactly is polystroob? The author has a way with writing, but I felt that she should have let the characters be the main focus and not the futuristic stuff. I was greatly disappointed in this one and tossed the book into the trash on my way out the door this morning."
1,Terrible Book,"I read exactly 30 pages of this book before I put it down in disgust. I was actually disgusted before that but I always try to give books at least 30 pages. I don't like sci fi/futuristic books, so my post is probably biased. I found the author's writing style to be confusing. I did not believe the characters were real. I did not believe in the future that she had created. I will never believe that humanity will end up like that. People will always have faith in their different religions which is why the world will never become so bad that people approve of their young daughter performing sex acts on robots to win beauty competitions. It was ridiculous to believe that teachers would be allowed to shock students as a form of disipline. The boy gang was stupid too. I guess we won't have law and order in the not so distant future according to this author. Avoid this book at all costs. (...)"
4,Excellent overview,"This is a straightforward, clear overview of document control. I think it is especially useful for presenting document control concepts to those whose primary function is not document control but who are being asked to comply with such a program. The book was shorter than expected, and one may need to look beyond this book for more detailed instruction in implementing a large-scale document management or document control program."
1,Too simple for the topic,"I was excited to see a book on documentation and made the mistake of ordering it without seeing a few reviews from other readers. 68 pages is barely enough for a couple of chapters, certainly not enough for a $20 book. Save your money and wait for a better book to come out, or read ""Business Process Improvement Workbook"" from Harrington, Esseling and Nimwegen which I would give 5 stars. This is the most disappointing business book I have ever purchased."
1,Disappionted,I gave this kit to my son for Christmas. He used the soldering gun to put together the kit and then used it for one other small kit( voice changer) and the soldering gun quit working. Since the kit part was put together I was not able to return the gun. I did not know I was buying a disposable soldering gun. Very disappointed!!!
5,Better than expected,"The iron that came with my kit was better than the one pictured. The construction is of medium quality and it WORKED without any problems. I bought this kit as a gift (along with the Elenco holder for about $5) for a my nephew (instead of a video game) for his birthday. Nice change of pace from video game addiction. He now has a new skill; he is 11 and was able to make most of the connections on the PCB after little instruction. The included instruction book (full size 8.5x11) teaches resistor codes but the resistors are attached to a labeled card so you don't have to spend time decoding them. Great kit. (I suggest active ventilation nearby to remove flux fumes readily, but not a big deal.)"
4,Terdkiat Limpeteeprakarn,I found exactly what I am looking for.Word with its example and how to use it.
3,mistake in explanation,"I liked the book except that the author made a major mistake, legally speaking when explaining the difference between civil and criminal litigation and discovery."
4,Its the 80's,I purchased this mainly for Tony Thompson we played in bands together and went to the same school. I enjoyed the interviews and behind the scenes stuff. The music is total 80's and speaks for itself. The world lost a great drummer when Tony passed
2,Power substation,"""Some Like it Hot"" is a great single. But listening to this album one gets beat over the head with a whole lot of drum. Too much drum. ""Murderess"" is a better song than ""Get it On"" (I never saw the fascination with Bolan's orginal version), but both are drowned in bass-beats.The lyrics on most of the album are of a smirking sexiness that laughs at it's own jokes. While that shtick worked for Robert Palmer, Power Station tried so hard to be serious. Except for horn lines and Palmer's giggling in ""Some Like it Hot"" Power Station seen unable to really let loose and rock.""Go To Zero"" and ""Harvest"" are an lp's equivalent of Hamburger Helper. And every song named ""Communication"" has been dreadful. If you buy this, you will listen to it once every four years because you caught the last chorus of ""Some Like it Hot"" on the radio and the stong got stuck in your head."
5,A great Christmas Gift!,This was a Christmas gift for our grandson who loves the Avengers. It is from the show with a lot less violence than the movie so it was acceptable to give as a gift.
2,"Be Warned, not whole season","The show is awesome, the DVD's are good and shipped quickly but I was disappointed to find out this was not a whole season but 6 episodes from the 1st season. Ouch for the money you spend. I bought this and the 3rd DVD for my two sons and we are not happy. It should be clearly marked in the description of the DVD that is is simply 6 episodes from season 1. I hope by writing this that no one else makes my mistake."
2,Widescreen? hardly...,"First, I have to say that I absolutely love this movie. I bought the VHS when it was first released as a rental copy. The DVD version of this film states that this is a ""widescreen"" or ""letterboxed"" presentation. I must say however that what they call ""widescreen"" is little more than the original VHS presentation with black bars cutting even more from the film! This is a ridiculous concept to me. The film on this DVD has been chopped on all sides from the theatrical version."
5,This is the reason movies are made.,"Buffalo '66 was easily the best film of the year. It is completely real and naturalistic. The writing is economical and extremely fluid. There is no hollywood fat (or, should I say fluff) to cut through--there is just a simple, engrossing, funny, sad story filled with wonderful characters. Vincent Gallo and Christina Ricci are marvelous and their development from strangers to ? (I can't completely give that away) is just great. There are a lot of really nice supporting performances including a plum role by Angelica Huston. Watch this film--you'll be delighted!"
4,I liked it,"This is a good movie to watch when it's 3 AM and you can't sleep. It's thoroughly entertaining, I wish there were more movies like it."
2,Disappointing!,"This film is an awful mess! Vincent Gallo directs as well as stars in this indie production about a released convict who looks for revenge against the man who put him in prison. Though Ben Gazzara is great as the father, I honestly though the story was pretty stupid! Gallo's characters are total ""nymcompoops"". Could have been better!"
4,Lovely and Crazy.,"I liked this movie, but at the start of the movie, it nearly put me to sleep. About 25 moments into it, I started to warm up to the movie, though. Ricci was very cute with her fake blond hair and chubby legs. And Vincent was hot looking in a crazy way. I would tell my friends to watch this one."
3,Fans Only-this is desktape Qualitly,"What Can I say-this is a great set but was never intended for official release,if you are a cUnleashed in the Eastasual fan buy Unleashed in the East, This recording is a bootleg copy and does not translate well."
5,The ONLY TRUE Hope,"In an ever turbulent world, our hope AND faith can be shaken at any given moment. ""The Reason for My Hope"" is one of the most powerful books I've read. It not only brings you face to face with God, but it can transform your life by giving you TRUE hope. This is one of Charles Stanley's best! If you're looking for encouragement and strength, this book will definitely give it to you! Most importantly, it leads you into the arms of a loving Heavenly Father, where ALL TRUE hope resides. This is a wonderful book that is to be read over and over!"
3,The Breakfast Club,"I like the new re release of The Breakfast Club. It's great that it is in dolby digital sound and dts. But what the hell happened to some bonus features. I was expecting one or two deleted scenes;maybe an audio commentary as well. I know there are different scenes in existence, since i've seen them on some of the edited for t.v. versions. Those are the only things I didn't like about the DVD"
3,Lots of Buffering,"Had to restart a few times, it would freeze up and it would buffer. Finally got through it. Great movie!"
4,"excellent deliver, good service",thanks for the fast service. dvd arrived on schedule and was new as stated. will look you use you again in the future
5,One of the best!,"This movie totally rocks! I just saw it on television and had to buy the DVD so I can see it in full. I really enjoyed it and let me say it is 300 times better than ""The Lost Boys"" who people seemed to think deserves the attention that the Breakfast Club got and still receives. Get this DVD, you will not be disapointed!"
5,Good retro,Always a good movie to show your children once they are old enough good memories and to see how young the actors are that are now old enough to have their own children
3,stuck in detention,"I saw this movie at school a few weeks ago,i think it's pretty cool and stuff.Kids in the class laughed and everything,well i didn't luagh that much tough because i've seen funnier ones like dumb and dumber.If your a serious person, don't watch this movie becuase you'll get bored,and if your going to watch it two times make sure you bring a pillow."
4,A good quality 80's movie,"This movie is a pretty good portrayal of young people; i.e. parties, drinking, mixed up emotions, detentions, etc. and also shows the faults of all the stereotypes; jock, nerd, little miss popular, weirdo, and rebel. I had to watch this movie for English class in preparation for a Cause/Effect paragraph and I would have to agree that there is a lot to cause some effect; i.e. kids annoying the crap out of each other, kids embarassing each other about sensitive topics, and corrupt principal being his usual self. There's many hilarious lines as well. So, overall, excellent!"
4,Best Teen Movie Ever!!!!!!!!!!!,"In this very realistic teen movie, we find 5 teens at school for a Saturday's detention. At the start we se very obvious examples of different levels of high school. The outcasts on the bottom , and the popular at the top. As the movie develops so do the characters. This movie delivers laughs,tears,joy,and sadness. It features some drug content, language, sexual dialogue, and thematic elements. I recommend it for middle to high schoolers.The reason I gave this movie 4 of 5 stars is because of the lack of features, I mean come on! They could have put at least a few deleted scenes or a ""making of"" documentary. There isn't even a trailer!!! I'm getting the high school reunion edition, atleast it has a trailer!"
5,GREASTEST MOVIE OF THE '80s!!!,"omg i love this movie!!!i saw it about a year ago when me and my mom went to the movie store to get a few movies we went diff. ways in the store and met she had the breakfast club w/ i thot for sure it would be a stupid 80s movie but i loved it!!!i am too a little disappointed that there werent any deleted scenes as judd nelson said ""there was over 4hrs of the movie to where it was more like the breakfast and lunch club!""..."
1,Who eats breakfast anymore anyway?,"OK in all seriousnessity...this movie has a misnomer. It really should just be called ""The Lunch/Snack Time Club"" because did anyone but me catch the fact that all the significant events occurred..DURING LUNCH/SNACK TIME?? helllo! it wouldn't even qualify for the brunch club! Nice try guys..but I totally picked up on this little mistake. Better luck next time...IF YOU EVER GET ANY FUNDING FOR ANY MORE MOVIES!J/K..it wasn't too bad. but really...lunch/snack time guys..come on."
4,Great Movie,This is a classic from my childhood. Great cast and a good story. HD and sound has good quality for being an older movie.
5,the princess,"I myself can identify most with molly ringwalds character claire.she is viewed by the others as having the perfect life,but she has her own problems.just because her family is wealthy,and is friends with the 'in' crowd doesn't make her life any easier.the others in the movie (in the beginning)only see her as a princess, but by the end they see her and her problems.this movie really teaches that no matter how you appear on the outside you can be a whole different person on the inside."
2,This CD is missing to many good songs.,"For a greatest hits album, it is missing many of their greatest hits. Infinite Dreams, Flash of The Blades, Wasting Love, and Flight of Icarus to name a few. They again if maiden did put out a album with all their good songs it would probably be about 4 CDs in length. Don't buy this CD, instead buy all their actual albums, you will enjoy them more."
4,Still missing something,"This album got some very good Maiden hits, but it lacks on the real cool ones. First 'cause it don't have any song with Paul Dianno - I think he is a great singer and some old classics as ""Iron Maiden"", ""Prowler"", ""Killers"", ""Wrathchild"", ""Phantom of the Opera"" etc. should be on this album. Second, they didn't put here some of the songs that made me listen Iron Maiden for a long time, such as ""Powerslave"", ""Where Eagles Dare"", ""Heaven Can Wait"", ""Moonchild"", even ""Wasting Love"" that was the first song I ever learned to play it whole in my guitar. But, the album still doin' once it is a Maiden one, and I really can't remember a Maiden album that disappointed me. So good that they didn't cut out ""Hallowed be Thy Name"" and ""Aces High"". UP THE IRONS!"
3,A good album for those interested in Maiden.,"If you're a long-time fan of Maiden then you don't need me to tell you that the track listing of this album is totally inadequate. This is for listeners unfamiliar with the Maiden experience. If you like what you hear on this, then you MUST get the full studio albums. This is only the tip of the iceberg; there is so much more great stuff of theirs. Start with the 80's stuff first.For those who want a best of compilation, there is a 2-cd version of ""Best of the Beast"" that is a lot better but is still missing a few key songs. The 2-cd set seems to have recently gone out of print in America (as of May,2000) but you may still be able to get it at Amazon.co.uk. Also, look at ""Ed Hunter"", it costs a bit more because of the game, but it may be perfect for you. Otherwise, you should put together your own compilation."
4,Paul Di'anno no show on Best of the Beast,"First off, this is a GREAT buy to start you off on Iron Maiden. It features the band's best hits with Bruce Dickinson at vocals, and a couple of songs with Blaze Bayley. ""Aces High"", ""The Trooper"" and ""Hallowed Be Thy Name"" are just some of the great hits on this record that keep me and million other Maiden fans faithful to the band.The only REALLY BIG problem with this album, which is also the reason why this album doesn't get a 5 star-review, is the absence of the hits from their first two albums, which started them off on their journey! Sure, Running Free"" is on there, but hits like ""Iron Maiden"", ""Prowler"", and ""Sanctuary"" (just to name a few) were all classic tracks on the albums that started Maiden off -- ""Iron Maiden"" and ""Killers"".Still, this compilation is a GREAT BUY for those just starting on Iron Maiden, and those who have been fans forever, like me."
1,How to Say It To Seniors,This book was written more for business and professional approaches to seniors that for day to day interactions with family. I found it very unsatisfactory and threw it away.My husband's 94 year old mother has come to live with us. She is in very good physical condition and fair mental condition. We struggle with what we thought were normal ageing issues but the book provided no help to us.
4,torn,"3 years ago i first heard ""inside"" while at work through our aei music service...about this time karen ramirez, olive, mandalay, mono, bertine, etc. were all creating a new world of music that took me from my 4AD days into the present. ""inside"" from terra deva is la bagnole of the type..later i discovered the cd was recorded in san francisco where i soon left, pulled apart became my theme cd. it's still with me, changing and current/relevant... all i want to know now is, when is she back in the studio....?"
4,Decent Deal,"I think BJs has a better deal on mixed fruit packs by Gerber, but if your child really loves peaches, this is great!"
1,Did not receive the correct product,"I cannot actually rate the quality of this product as Amazon did not send me the correct one. I ordered the one above, with lavender and chamomile, but received a different one. Amazon will not offer a means to exchange this product, only the refund. I should have gone with another seller/company."
4,Charles Aznavour - 20 Great Songs in English,"I ordered it and hope I like it. I've only heard him sing ""The Old Fashioned Way,"" which I love, and hope it's on this album. It would be nice if Amazon would list the songs on the CDs they sell. I was close to not buying it because I want ""The Old Fashioned Way"" and don't know if it's on this CD as I haven't received it yet. However, I know he has a marvelous voice, and feel certain that the songs will be winners.Can't rate it until I hear it.-Barbara Woodward"
5,This book's title is right on the money!,"I expected that a book on business leadership published by the Harvard Business School would be solid reading and I was anticipating the traditional 10 Best with honorable mentions. I was very pleased to find MUCH more - 10 chapters reflecting the 10 decades with excellent insights to the world at large and how people thoiught at the time and looking ahead.This book describes 100 people in many different roles, industries and with varying perspectives. Well done!As always, comments are appreciated and welcomeJohn Hogan, CHA CHEHoganHospitalityHospitalityEducators"
5,A cartoon series worth checking out!,"This is a great cartoon series. My son who is 3 and I both enjoy these cartoon episodes. My daughters (8&5) really enjoy them also. Great characters, great story lines, and great animation. Of you our your youngsters are into superheros and haven't checked this out yet you need to. It is well worth the 10 bucks!"
5,"I laughed, I cried, I reminisced","It was an absolute page turner. The characters reminded me of firends that have been with me since the day of time. The tears, arguments, relationships, everything. I highly recommend this book, and after reading, loan to a good friend."
4,Frienship is an awesome gift,"Better than I know myself started out slow, so I was feeling a little tired of it, however I'm certainly glad I didn't put it down. This book was excellent!!! The bond between these three friends was so real, the characters reminded me of my own life,my friendship of 20+ years & the trial and tribulations we go through(and have been through). Carmen was the strongest of the union, she faced the most childhood issues. Regina was the sassy cool girl who turned to the ""street"" and what it had to offer. Jewell was the rich and well off that had ""skeletons"" laying in her closet and under her bed. Please read this book, you wont be disappointed."
2,Grandeur delusions,"Plodding, self-consciously classical arrangements hamper any residual compositional fortitude inherent with these acoustic sketches ala the classical guitar intros found on a few Genesis tracks."
2,retrocedamos 150 años,"!Que manía la de todos los rockeros que abundan en el mundo clásico!. Es increible que Vaugah Williams, Elgar y demás tardoromaticos ingleses sigan siendo, más de 100 años después, el referente de lo que es la música clásica para todos los rockeros que se meten en camisas de once varas. Paul MacCartney, Tony Banks o, ahora, Steve Hackett encabezan una larga lista de músicos que parecen olvidar que tras aquellos maestros ha existido el siglo XX. Ligeti, Stockhausen, Lutoskawski, Webern o Messiaen parece como si se los hubiera tragado la tierra. No es que me parezcan malas las composiciones de este Metamorpheus, lo que me parece es que influencias más ""modernas"" no habrían estado de más. Yo no digo que HAckett se ponga a hacer música concreta, pero, vamos, un poquito más de contemporaneidad y algo menos de tardoromanticismo no le vendría mal"
5,Too funny,Very funny love it can't wait till next year to get it back out. The kids really enjoyed this at christmas
1,What is the song in the final credits?????,I looked up this soundtrack hoping to find the name of the 70's song they played in the closing credits. Much to my surprise and many others (I'm guessing)...TPTB decided no to include it. Can anyone help???
4,Helpful Guide for Art History Students,"Head of the Department of Fine Arts (art history) at the University of Hong Kong had all of us first-year students buy this book. It is permanently stocked by the campus bookstore.It is a very good guide, with actual examples of short essays by students. In my opinion, one of the examples is a tad un-scholarly, using the first person and personal anecdotes in what is otherwise a formal essay. Some professors may not approve... mine did.I read this short book and used it; I am sure it contributed to my high GPA."
5,Mind Blowing,"This book was amazing it grab my attention with the first sentence from there I was trapped. I couldn't put the book down and every chance I got I was reading. I am 25 far from a mother and not even married and this book kept me on my toes waiting to see what will happen next. It puts out there that these ""stay at home"" Moms have alot of spunk and want to have fun just as much as I do. In all Nelsie Spencer first novel was a hit in my books and I would love to read the sequel to this book or any other novel she plans to write."
2,Definitely not worth it,I was really excited when I saw this book and decided to order it. Honestly though it doesn't talk about Nick Carter that much. Mostly it talks about Jane Carter. She does discuss Nick Carter but we learn more about her and his family than him. It was boring. I couldn't keep reading it. I had to take breaks because I kept falling asleep. Save your money don't buy this.
5,This book is a really great book to read,I think that this book is a really great book especially if you like Nick Carter. I liked this book because it told about all the stuff that Nick's family went through to get him where he is today. It also talks about his siblings and how supportive they are of him...I think that this book is worth more than 5 stars because to me Nick is worth more than 5 stars.
4,the nature and limits of prudence,"Books by Trollope that are not part of the two series (Palliser, Barsetshire) tend to be neglected. This one deserves far more attention. It is Trollope at his best. The structure is intricate, the characters superb, the pace brisk. the wit and satire sharp . No dry spells, no simpereing Victorian maidens. This has a Balzacian flavour to it; there are a number of characters looking for the main chance. Caroline is one of his most interesting creations. There are three plots which are both parallel and contrasting: George and Caroline, Adela and Arthur, and Sir Lionel's search for a rich heiress. I would say the major theme of the book is the limits of prudence. The scenes in Cairo and Jerusalem add color, an exotic quality, to the story. A delightful read."
4,A departure for Turow,"A WWII novel by Scott Turow is a real departure from his legal-based writings. He proves that he can spin a tale in many genres. This book is well written although the jumping back and forth between the present and the past is sometimes distracting. The plot of a son trying to find out about his father's military career and his court martial after his father has passed away is very moving at times. It explains to the son why his father was the personality he became and his refusal to talk about his military experiences. He also learns much about his mother and her background during the military years and journey.I enjoyed this book, especially the war scenes as depicted by Turow through the eyes of the father. The ending is rewarding as it explains why the court martial took place and the importance of the father's decisions leading tothe court martial. It leaves the son proud of his father and mother, ordinary people who became heroes."
4,Very Very Good,"This video goes, in a word, HUGE! Monster park kickers, sick back country kickers, plenty of urban sequences, and some big-mountain to top it all off. The Jeremy Jones footage, especially the on board ""experience"" stuff is incredible. The Cinematography is exceptional and the use of Heli's and angles are amazing. Music and transitions could be better but the footage makes up for it. If you're like me, the lifestyle is an important part of snowboarding and that's the only thing I felt this video lacked. Hope it helps..."
4,"Expensive, but great footage","This vid is put together well. The footage of Jeremy riding the edges of this epic spine are crazy. Hip hop ish soundtrack, good heli camerawork."
3,Lacking Bass,"Little disappointed in the unit, hoped it might have a bit more bass. BTW, there is no ""Mega Bass"" circuit you can ""kick-in"", as the product description says; there is a Power switch and a Volume control, and that is it. I have to think you can do better for $60. They are easily portable, however, and far better than most laptop's speakers (though that is really not saying much)."
3,I Don'T Think So,"Not long ago, I gave away a cassette of Glen Campbell's greatest stuff; it had ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress"" (I think) and ""I Knew Jesus Before He Was a Superstar"" along with many of his standard hits. The non-hits (represented as hits) spoiled it for me; if I want to hear just the hits, I don't want to hear something else. That is what this CD is about. I'd like to meet the person(s) who titled this CD. The same HIT songs you can find elsewhere; if you'll listen to anything by GC, then go for it."
5,Glen Campbell 20 Greatest Hits,All I can say is wonderful! I love this man's voice and style in the late 60s and it still stands up as good work now.
4,A majsetic dark wonderland.,"This is one band I totally respect! Fantastic arrangements, multiple layers of instruments come together to create a strong dark journey that takes you back into time and explores a variety of musical ethnic backgrounds. This CD is a collabaration of their works from past, a good way to get a good idea of thier history and a great starter Cd for this band if you've been wanting to check this band out but not sure where to start."
5,Nice Classic Hawaiian Music,"Great CD! Very nice classic Hawaiian music. Where did they find this great classic stuff? 20 of the 22 tunes fall into the 1929-1939 time slot with two nice 1954 Tau Moe tunes thrown in. Extensive liner notes on all the artists. Two VERY minor criticisms/comments: The volume level on a couple of the tunes seems too high and causes minor distortion. 1930s recordings what should I expect? Second, a mistake in the liner notes, one song omitted and an extra song not on the CD listed. This is a nice classic Hawaiian music CD, I thoroughly enjoy it."
2,"Great 1st disc (all available elsewhere), mediocre 2nd disc","I fell for the allure of a ""foreign"" release and half-way wasted $... for this compilation. 1st disc is full of great classics, but 2nd is all rock-funk marginal-at-best material. My suggestion is to find the classics on a $... single CD. I'm going to throw away the 2nd disc in this collection. Aretha, like Streisand, has recorded the best and worst ends of the music spectrum."
4,Stereo Spector & more,"These are the stereo mixes for the 5 Spector songs. I don't know if this is the same remaster as the ""Universal Masters"" CD? The same 18 songs are on this release."
5,Rhythmic Intensity,This single is a must for both Chemical Brothers and Underworld fans. Underworld Mix 2 is absolutely intense - Darren Emmerson has excelled himself once more.
3,Copper Birdbath,"Beautiful birdbath with a copper finish. Note- finish. This item will rust with regular use and that isn't great for birds. If you have a protected area to hang it, can clean it regularly, and want a pretty accent, this is great to buy. Just toss a few stones in the bottom for birds to stand on."
4,Want to Sell Book? Must keep up with times!,"Granted, the book was published a while back, but the material is still a windfall. The CD that comes with the book is for older computers. So one must convert each letter that is in txt format to doc. It was worth it."
1,San Fran cisco Jazz,"I am rating t Excellent although I havs not listened to it. I bought for a friend who is a ""student of jazz.""She seemed to be very interested when she received it. i am sure she will enjoy it ."
4,"it is far better than the latter ones,unique sound","i get quite disapponited after my great expectation of the latter projects of This Mortal Coil coz they can't never reach the prime time in [It'll end in tears],which's so beautiful like a work from otherworld,maybe the main reson is that the best song in the album is featuring Liz from CT. but Kangaroo is also gorgeous."
3,"New, but not really","This is not a new album, as shown in the Amazon specs. This is a 1998 re-release of a 1984 production. Still, very nice. We all wish they made more. It goes to show you how far ahead of the times TMC was in 1984."
5,I use a little bit of this in every conversation.,"I had already read several books in the category of body language, reading people, word analysis, et al, when I got this one. I was pleasantly surprised, then, to find material here that had not been presented in the other books. Further, it was very insightful, realistic, and highly useable information that I've used since in a variety of conversation settings. I've read the 48 Laws book, which advocates deceipt, and found this one parallels some of the same points, but takes them in quite different directions. It equips the reader to recognize deception rather than practice it, which I've found renders much more power in either a business or a personal situation. I've given this book to several friends to read, and they all come back with the same feedback: Fantastic!If you want to hear what is really being said by others, read this book!"
4,Great Book!,"This book really gives a lot of insight on the world of deception. This book really helps me to pick apart a suspects statement. It really helped me to detect those words and phrases that help me break a lie and feel confident when doing it. All in all its a good tool to have, and acts as a great prop when its siting on your desk and the suspect notices it;)"
5,FANTASTIC!!!,I have used this machine for 4 years. I am a reseller and have found this to be the best machine on the market. I purchased another machine for $1000 and returned it as I found that this one worked better. Great product!
5,A pedophile's dream come true.,"In the DVD, you get to see how an adult man has gained a pre-adolescent girl's total trust by being her supervisor and could abuse it whenever he pleases.It is about Henrietta, a preteen cyborg assasin with a heart of a young prepubescent girl. She uses guns and kills lots of terrorists with little or no remorse. She can kill a man with her bare hands. She speaks three languages. She does bleed but her pain goes away. But when she reaches puberty, she begins to experience young womanhood, lust, love, jealousy, affection and femininity, etc."
1,VCamNow Digital Video Camera Stinks,"This product worked for approximately 30 minutes before breaking. It was overpriced to begin with ($159), cheap in appearance and the electronics were not durable. The camera stopped functioning after about half an hour of gentle play, nothing rough at all. It would be better to buy one of the many $99 videocameras they have out for adults. It would probably last longer."
4,A Great History of Scotland minus a few people and events,"I am very glad I read this book. It was a very readable and enjoyable history of Scotland. The book was so good, I am tempted to make a return trip to Scotland. This book was that inspiring.I especially enjoyed the chapters on the Romans in Scotland, William Wallace, Robert the Bruce, and Bonnie Prince Charlie.I was a little upset as to the lack of information about the enlightenment in Scotland. But other than that, this was a great book.It was very readable, with new information, and some great quotes.This was a great book, I wished it had more, but none the less, it was a great purchase and time well spent."
2,Wow. That's a lot of detail....,"If you are not Scottish (or a learned scholar on the topic of the History of Scotland) I would recommend that you put the training wheels back on your bike and read something a bit easier than this...This page-turner was intended for the advanced reader. Lots of reference to Scottish cities that you've never heard of...or worse yet, hills outside of cities that you've never heard of....This isn't a book for someone trying to learn about the Country."
5,Ambient Goth,A slow lingering polished project of fathomless melancholy. Mystified storylines of love and tragedy beautifully presented yet somehow pleasantly disturbing. Gothic storms and effervescent fires slowly burning through the ages. One cannot escape being drawn in deeply by songs of sad happiness and mysterious emotional landscapes. A skilled production by Ivo & Frye. This was the second of three such productions and the masterwork of the trio.
3,Now it's really ending in tears,"For me at least, the woman pictured on the cover is staring forward aghast, saying to herself, ""What the hell happened?"" You (and I) can interpret this in two ways: (1) that this record is really a descent from its predecessor, It'll End in Tears, and (2) that the goodness of Filigree & Shadow itself actually falls off as one nears its end. It becomes overwrought, and at times I don't know if I'm hearing something from 4AD or an... impersonation of Culture Club. I'm also told that Blood is even more disappointing, so head for the origin with this series, folks."
5,"Excellent, for beginner and up","I read this book with a view to priming myself on the mathematics of economics for my work and for anticipated future studies in economics.I found the book to be delightfully clear and free of sticking points - this latter point is very important for those who, like myself, are learning independently.I look forward to reading Chiang's ""Elements of Dynamic Optimization"" next."
3,Luna has passed its prime,"Luna hit their creative peak several albums back with ""Penthouse,"" which is an absolute masterpiece. Since then, their albums have had their moments, but just aren't nearly as interesting. Highlights from their lastest include ""Superfreaky Memories,"" ""Math Whiz,"" and an absolutely ace cover of Guns'n'Roses' ""Sweet Child of Mine."" The latter song has the advantage of not featuring Dave Wareham's lyrics, which range from the incomprehensible to the outright dopey. Overall, not bad but you could do a lot better with ""Penthouse."""
2,Shostakovich Concertos on Apex label.,"Shostakovich: Piano Concertos Nos. 1 & 2; Sonata No. 2This product as recorded by Apex is inferior and completely unsatisfactory. The CD itself has periods when there is no sound, frequently. The interpretation of the music is reasonable but does not compare with more accomplished artists such as Marc-Andre Hamelin."
1,Mardi Gras Massacre,"If you love cheesy horror flics this is for you.If you liked the films shown by ""Elvira, Mistress of the Dark"", or ""Chiller"" then this is what you want. If you can't see the humor in a really bad low budget horror film, then this is not for you."
4,well i liked it...,some of my metalhead friends complained about this album. personally i think its great. its complex and its alot to take in. but all the albums worth buying are that way. my favorite song is the invaluable darkness. the clean vocals are still caught in my head from this album. and the riffage in this album are amazing. i recommend this album to anyone who likes their music to be challenging. my only beef is the instrumental. it felt like filler to me. other than that its a great album.
5,Soft velvety horses!,These adorable horses are made of plastic & coated with a velvety texture. Many have rabbit fur mane and/or tail. Herd a whole corral of them!
1,cheaply made - with low quality sound issue.,Too bad because otherwise the concept is great.Basically they used the cheapest possible materials so this may not be durable. Also the recorder is not great.
1,Piece of crap,"Bought these for 94 year old Father so he could make notes to himself. One for home and one to carry in his pocket. Opened the package and put the batteries in and neither one of them worked. All you could get was static when trying to record. MADE IN CHINA, now there's a surprise. Returned them to Amazon with no problem, the only bright spot with this purchase."
3,ok,"This was ok... one of those moments that you get what you pay for... it wasn't bad, but it really wasn't good"
3,A Story About a Rich But Boring Family,Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward are always wonderful. This is a story about a rich but boring family. Each member of the family is fighting to fit in as the world changes around them during the 30s and 40s. I kept waiting for a heroic moment. There wasn't one. I believe that may have been the point.
3,Mr. & Mrs Bridge,Just watching both actors is always a joy. Paul Newman plays a totally different charactor than any of his others
5,Lots of fun to watch!!!!!!!,"Stumbled across this movie one night right around Aug. 2012. Gotta say it's a great comedic twist to a side of Elvis few may actually know. Very entertaining and cleverly funny to the point where you ask yourself, ""what in the world is he going to do next!"" I am a big Elvis fan and there are times during the movie when I want to believe things happened exactly like the movie suggests with regards to Elvis' humor, wit, and generosity. A great movie and fun to watch."
2,dissapointed,"i received the perfum after 3 days of ordering it. i was amazed by how fast i received the package, the problem began when i tested the perfum, it smells like pure alcohol, i am very dissapointed of the quality of the product, it seems like a cheap imitation that i can easily find on the streets for 10 dollars or less,i had the original ferragamo before and the one i received is nothing compared to the original ferragamo, i am very dissapointed"
2,Can't play the DVD in my car and hang after play at the end of espisod,"Lousy and poor quality on DVD. I can't play finish on my DVD player.. Besides, i try to play it at my car DVD player, always gave Disc Error. Sad on it.. If not my youngest son like it, i will return it immediately."
2,Pretty choppy and weak,"There are a few interesting Biblically-based thoughts in this book, but the format and syntax can be summed up in two words: wretched poetry. The free-form is atrocious and choppy, and the organization is servicable. I've read serious books that discuss the life of Jesus and Christian faith, and I've read solid free-form poetry. This is pathetic in comparison. I can't help but wonder why something of such low caliber would even be published.It may be somewhat suitable for the junior high youth group crowd, but it is far from a sounding board for deep, mature, articulated discussion. Whatever you are looking for, be it an acocunt of the life of Jesus, apologetic discussion, or info on Christian faith, much better can surely be found elsewhere. Skip it."
2,Damaged,Item poorly packed. Mirror frame attachment broken and had to repair. Overall quality fine. Could have included extra slides. Price was decent but I'd rather spend more and get better quality scope.
1,well...u should play underwater in the carribean,"ok for some songs but others stink...altogether, itsa horrible album...not worth buying, only, on this, there is no 0 star rating...good effort to the artists, though..."
1,1 and a half stars would be better,"Eeeeew. It's no surprise that this album hit 12x platinum here in the US prior to ""Oops I Did It Again,"" I give her credit for her success, but it's all Backstreet Boys/N Sync/Christina Aguilera/soundalike material designed to help young girls get out of the hardest things in life. There are so many better artists out there, listen to any one of them and you'll soon notice what's missing in her."
3,Used to be good,Britney used to be known as the best teen pop singer. This album proved that she could sing. She also started a trait of upcoming singers. Christina Aguilera. After this album everyone can tell that she gave up. although Christina's debut album was not as successful as Britney's it was clear that Christina had more vocal abilities than Britney. This album is okay I only like #1 & #2.
2,2 stars for only 2 good songs,The first 2 songs are good but after that all the rest are so bad. Those 2 songs are the only ones that really get you up and moving.
1,Downright Tripe,"Possibly one of the worst albums of the year. Britney cannot sing worth anything, and any vocal skill she has is not displayed on this album. The dipthongs are flat-out annoying (for example, the awful mispronunciation ""...oh bay-buh bay-buh...""). Perhaps if she could actually pronounce words correctly this may be a slightly better album. But not that it matters, since she didn't actually write any of these songs. The songs aren't actually about anything important anyway - they all have the same, 'gee whiz, boys are fun and I'm an idiot' type lyrics. Britney is a mere flash in the pan, reminiscent of the Tiffany's and Debbie Gibson's of yesteryear. This album is awful and a pathetic attempt at pop. Puh-lease, ""E-mail My Heart"" ? How can anyone take this seriously? For real pop fun, try the pop-punk band Mr. T Experience, for real clever lyrics and savory pop melodies...that's my two cents."
2,Disappointed listener,"""Baby One More Time"" is a disappointment to pop fans. The lyrics are so sugar-coated and Britney exudes no vocal range or depth whatsoever. The only decent song is the title track. Her videos are attention-getting and she may look good, but strip away all of the image and all that is left is stale music. Sorry, but I regret listening to this album."
1,I wish I could rate this lower,"DO NOT BUY THIS CD! It is a waste of money. I am advising everyone who even thinks that they want this CD that Britney is a manufactured ""singer"" and she doesn't deserve all the credit that she gets. Grammy? I don't think so Britney. Better keep on dreaming."
1,Someone hit HER,This CD is the most annoying CD I've ever heard. I actually gave it to my sister....the only bad thing about that is now she plays it all the time! If you're older than 12 chances are you won't like it....I definatly would most waste the money on it!
3,Not bad,"There's a few great songs, but there's also some bad ones. And there's too many remixes of 'Drive Me Crazy' that I think it'd be better if they didn't put them on. If you like catchy tunes like BSB, N'Sync, etc., this CD is worth it."
1,More of the same...,"This is just more of the trite, bubble-gum, producer-driven crap with a pretty face to sell it - same old stuff the music industry has been spewing out lately. Nothing even remotely imaginative from an artistic standpoint. There's so much studio ""sweetening"" on this CD that it is impossible to tell what her voice really sounds like under the dozens of additional tracks of instruments, synths, backing vocalists and effects used to draw attention away from the fact that she just isn't that talented. At least Debbie Gibson can actually sing... let's see Ms. Spears do Broadway, then we'll talk."
1,SO SAD SO TRUE,"Well nowadays pretty much every child icon is familiar with the voice and face of Miss Spears. She has made a name for herself, but is her talent in reality worth record breaking stature? Honestly NO, society is deprived of a young female role model, so the first one to enter the late 90's pop sensation time period, everyone had choosen to jump the band wagon and idolize her. True she does conatain more talent that the average Joe, but all the publicity she has recieved had been unbelievably exaggerated. During live performances Britney is repeadly booded off stage for singing incredably horrible. The type of songs this young lady sings are in my oppinion not all their cracked up to be. They are the types of songs you can not stand, but you know every single word, because the music is so catchy. The music on this CD is not #1 on Billboard material. If you are a true music lover this is NOT the selection you should choose."
3,Well...,"This album is not that bad..But it's just one of those pop albums which is really common... I like ""Baby one more time"" and ""sometimes"", but after you hear them so much you get really sick... She's doesn't really have a great voice like Whitney Huston or Mariah Carey.... she just vibrates her voice too much... to just sound alike them... but I think she desires to sing like them so I give her credit for effots! keep up good work, Britney... ONE OF YOUR VIEWERS...."
1,YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i dont understand how people can advritise this stuff you are supposed to be promoting music not crap!!!! first of all she cant sing and second who does she think she is to be dissn' the Backstreet Boys when they didnt even want to put anything (recordings) on her album it was her choice and the record label's choice
2,"Britney Spears is cool, but she is getting annoying!!","Everybody thinks she is so cool, but her voice drives me crazy now! Hit me baby one more time... that is all you hear on the radio now a days. I think she has a good talent, but this hip hop music is starting to all sound the same."
5,Britney always remember no one will be better than you!,"Britney if you have read some of the bad comments, well...let me tell you this, just don't listen to them, they are the ones who sucks!"
4,"Catchy Tunes, But WHAT is ""E-Mail My Heart""?","Britney Spears' songs are catchy, but I have one problem that brought my rating down to four stars. WHAT is ""E-mail My Heart""? Who sings about e-mail, much less e-mailing to an inside organ of the body? Otherwise, she has good dance tunes that you're bound to like."
2,"Brain-less, Soul-less and Emotion-less","Britney has wonderful looks and she dances very well. As a singer, however, she leaves much to be desired:1. Unlike some singers who're not blessed with a great voice but who know how to make wonders out of it, Britney is neither gifted with a naturally beautiful voice nor does she know what to do with it.2. Some of her songs have very good beat and are great for dancing - but that's all you can get out of them. The lyrics are ""blah, blah, blah"" and there's no substance to ANY of her songs. No emotions, no depth, no meaning. If you want something that is totally drained of anything but has a good beat, Britney is a top choice.In a word, this is a CD that you'd buy and listen to a few times, and then take to the Princeton Record Exchange."
3,NOT THE GREATEST DEBUT,"NOT BAD BUT NOT GREAT. THE ONLY SONGS I LIKE WEREBABY ONE MORE TIME,CRAZY,I WAS BORN TO MAKE YOU HAPPY , AND E-MAIL MY HEART.HER VOICE ISNT A STAND-OUT SHES PRATICALLY VANILLA (PLAIN) WELL SHE BETTER WORK ON SONGS THAT ACTUALLY HAS A MEANING TO IT, DESPITE HER 13 MILLION COPIES SOLD IN THE U.S, SHE STILL NEEDS TO WORK ON EVERYTHING"
2,"Oops, she did it again....","I have heard britney's new song on the radio (and who hasnt), and I find it to be the same beats and form that was in ""Baby one more time"". A good quality in a singer should be the way she matures and molds her music into a something worth listening to. I must admit that I have been caught singing britney's songs, but they are really catchy. Sorry brit, try again. Also, what's with the CD titles? You think she could at least think of something better than the name of her first single since she doesn't sing that well, dress nicely, or write her own music. Sorry britney, but Christina Aguilera can sing AND she has a nice body (but it has no silicone)."
4,I like the CD but not the person.,I loved the music but...i think Britney spears looks/dresses like someone on 54th st.
1,Good if you're 8 years old and don't know good music from your A**,"This music is crap - how can one listen these wimpy arrangements and candyfloss melodies without bursting into laughter or losing their lunch? It sounds like radio jingle music, not music you would actually listen to and enjoy. The NASA-produced vocals and 128 tracks of cheesy keyboards might sell Pepsi and Disney, but will never pass as real music."
2,a little disappointed,after the first song i was waiting to hear something else good but only came across pathetic songs with repetitive tunes. i was really disappointed with this cd...i thought it would be better.
1,this sucks!,"I heard the C.D. from my friend and don't want to hear it again. The songsw, all except SOMETIMES, are horrible! If you want something good, try the Backstreet Boys."
2,COME ON PEOPLE! I MEAN REALLY!,Many people say she is sweetness well these people are messed up this Cd only has 1 good song that gets ssssssooooooo annoying after a while and thats U Drive Me Crazy well lemme tell u somthin' peoples THIS CD DRIVES ME CRAZY GET A LIFE BRITNEY SPEARS!
