2,GBH,Not sure why the double kick keeps appearing. I wish they would make a record w/ out all the group chants and big double kick drums.They are great at punk rock and they stumble a bit at metal. Pass on this if you like the early records.
5,The Game Of All Games,"When I played this game at my friends house, I loved it and played a long time. As soon as I got home I was on the web trying to find it for dreamcast. As soon as I found it I was begging my mom to get it and making deals with her to get it. I haven't gotton it yet but when I do, I'll be the happiest person on Earth."
1,Awful!!!,"This product is SO cheaply made! I am an amateur swimmer who purchased them as a requirement for a college swim class, but even I could tell that it was a terrible product! The black foamy material ripped off within a week! The lenses got WAY too foggy too quickly, and the goggles let water in like it was nobody's business! I had to purchase new ones within a week! (3 classes!) DO NOT PURCHASE!"
1,Not what they used to be,"I've bought the Speedo sprint goggles before, and they lasted a long time. Not any more. Six months, max - and the foam gaskets ripped off the lenses. I was taking really good care of these, too."
3,not lasting,it was pretty good at first but then the foam thing started to rip off so i don't think you should buy this product
5,CD and Text,"I have read the print book and listened to the 4 CD set a few times. I am more partial to his earlier recordings, but the notion of ""future lives"" is progressive in terms with keeping up with the times!"
1,A great illusionist,"I could have forgiven all the shortcomings of the style, if not for the fact that Brian denies Jesus in this book.Brain is so marveled with his own power to affect people's minds that he is seeing himself almost as a new grand prophet. A chapter where he talks about Jesus is completely inappropriate.I used to find his work fascinating but after reading this book think that he is just a great illusionist."
4,A lot to think about,"This book was written 24 years after Weiss' first encounter with a past life regression. In this book, he summarizes all he's learned from taking patients into their past, and also with some patients who seem to be describing future lives. For the most part, Same Soul, Many Bodies is a synopsis of all he's learned about why we live our lives and what we need to do to continue forward in our spiritual growth. Even if you can't believe anything he's saying, which will be difficult because he's got lots of data, you'll learn a lot about how to drastically improve your life. Enjoy!"
2,Nothing to shout about,"I completely enjoyed his Book ""Many Lives, Many Masters"" where he regressed people into past lives so I thought I would try this book where he also progressed people into their future lives, but I was wrong.Maybe it is just me but it just didn't interest me and sometimes I got a bit bored when he would break from his patients and talk about the process and such. In his first book I also enjoyed when he or patient would talk to the Masters. Not really sure if he did that towards the end of the book because to be honest at about 3/4 of the way, I gave up on it due to lack of interest.Just my point of view."
4,Fast Service,"Good quick service, DVD was here within a couple days and in the condition that was presented."
2,The best of?,There are too many Gems missing to be considered the Best Of. There are many compilations out there that are better than this one.
5,Awesome,"This sauce is the best I have had for a very low sodium sauce, however, the shipping from this particular company cost more than the sauce itself. Other sauces I have ordered did not charge a shipping and or was very reasonable. $7+ for shipping one bottle of hot sauce was a huge factor as to why I wont buy from them again."
5,great sweatshirts,"bought several of these sweatshirts in different colors, for christmas gifts for my grandkids. Brilliant colors, very good prices!"
3,bango tango,"I recently purchased the two beautiful creatures cds. I really liked these cds so I purchased this bango tango cd. Its a pretty good cd, but its not one that I would listen to over and over again. the music is just a lot more mellow than the beautiful creatures cds."
5,A BOOK YOU REALLY NEED,"The first edition was excellent and now this 2nd edition is outstanding especially with the book for on the go. All the main wholes are now filled in and with the downloadable forms-- that saves me and my staff time and money. I is airtight with excellent writing and gammar usage and skills. I woud reccomend this book to any one not just in the grant. business, but in the corporate business. The sales and consultantswrite grants every day to win over clients, but no major book covers that topic and the business topic at one time that and that is a big market to fill and this book has the material to do the job. The American Marketing Associations gave it a strong backing at one of their meetings, and told members that proposal writing is not just for grants, etc, but for the businesses of today and tommorow and to give them a head start. Find the best books -- not just the simple ones, but the good ones and go with it.I wish you all good luck on your projectss>"
5,Painful To Read But Worthwhile,"First of all, I'd like to thank Brooks Brown for sharing what is probably the best picture of Klebold and Harris that we are going to get.While we may never completely understand every single reason or every single factor that led to this tragedy, Mr Brown helps to answer at least some of the questions."
2,"A disappointing ""thriller.""","I'm a longtime Garwood fan, but this book was a disappointment. The ""bad guy"" character was unconvincing and there was very little of the classic Garwood romance wound into the story. It was either a bad romance novel or a very bad murder mystery -- take your pick. Garwood should stick to the historical romances, her true forte."
2,Disappointing,"Being an avid fan of Garwood's, I was terribly disappointed in this book. I would wait for months on lists at book stores for my copy of her next book to come in, eagerly awaiting day. However, this book lacked all that her previous ones had. There was no passion, depth of character, and none of the famous humor I had come to expect. Her past books made me smile, laugh out loud at the antics, and always had a lot of thought into them. You cared about the characters. This book had nothing to offer. I can only hope that her next offers more."
4,YES!,"I'm pleased to see Ms. Garwood branch out into this genre. I used to read her historical romances years ago, I finally got burned out on her Montgomery lineage of characters. I recommend this book to all readers. The book has a good mix of the suspense/drama/romance storylines currently popular. The characters are well fleshed out, and their personalities come across effectively providing believable situations as the story unfolds. I enjoyed the book tremendously, and would enjoy seeing a sequel with the Noah Clayborne character as a follow up. Are you listening Ms. Garwood?"
1,Heartbreaker,"Typical mind numbing romance, girl meets boy, course she doesn't like him very much , but end up together anyway , romances are so stupid., can predict the outcome without even finishing it. Wouldn't have read it if not for bookclub. Thank god we don't read this trash as a rule."
2,Electrifying?,"A blurb on the cover of Heartbreaker describes it as being ""electrifying"". Not to me. I like my thrillers to thrill, my romances to be romantic, and my suspense novels to be mysterious. To me, this book was none of the above...I found this book very boring...None of the characters add thrills, suspense, or romance to the story. And, never for a moment, was I excited, terrified, or immersed in this book.I've read Ms. Garwood before. Her male characters are usually charismatic, her heroines entertaining, her love scenes, sexy. I saw none of that, in this book. To me, two stars may be high. But, the book has a good flow, and the writing itself, is fine..."
1,Dissapointing,"I usually love her books but this one left me dissapointed. Where was the spark between the hero and herione that you usually see in her books? Sorry but this one left no impression on me at all, usually after I read her books Im sad to say goodbye to the characters, this book though...I cant even remember the main characters names!"
3,Disappointing,"I just finished the book this morning. I am somewhat disappointed. After reading Ransom, Heartbreaker was a let down. I didn't find any dimemsion to the two lead characters. Usually, I am able to empathize with her main characters, but this time, I could not. Nick and Laurant seemed so ""blah.""I did, however, like Noah. He seemed far more interesting--especially given his last name (but I don't want to give anything away). There were a couple of good scenes in the book, and they usually involved Noah.Ms. Garwood usually develops the feelings of her heroes and heroines better than she did in this book, and perhaps that is why this one feels so flat.I might suggest this book to a fan of modern romances."
3,So close,I am sad to say that this game was ALMOST awesome! It is a lot of fun for a few weeks but there are just too many things they did not do right to make this a long term game. If they had just done one or two things better then this would be one of those titles I would not be able to put down. Maybe The Guild III will get it right.
1,Sony DVD-R 100 pack consistently fail during burn.,I have two 100 stacks of Sony DVD-R 4.7GB discs which all consistently fail during burn in my I Mac computer using Roxio toast. The discs make buzzing noises during the burn and fail before the burn is halfway through. This discs even have difficulty ejecting from the computer. You would think it would be a computer problem. I've been using these Sony discs for a few years. But when I substitute Memorex discs of the same type they run perfectly.The Sony discs were made in Taiwan. One Sony 100 pack was purchased months apart from the other but they both present the same problems.
1,So far no good,"Got the disks in today, ordered so I could do back up disks for a new system and so far only one out of ten disks have worked. Got 40 more to try with the hopes of at least finding 2 more acceptable disks."
1,dvd-r disks not recognized by sony optical drive,"I tried 3 out of the container and they all failed to recognized by my Sony drive; ""please insert a compatible disk."" I had no problems using the fuji, memorex or Staples disks."
4,"Pretty good product, occasional bad disc",I've had better luck with the Sony DVD-R discs than any other brand out there. My only gripe is that there is the occasional bad disc(s) in the spindle.
5,I burned 28 out of 28 perfectly!,"Purchased a 25-Pk Spindle of these which included 3 Bonus discs making a total of 28 discs. They burned perfectly, not even one coaster; zip, none, nada - I got 28 out of 28 using my Panasonic recorder at 16X and they played fine on every component I fed them to! Will buy more.Pros:*Value*Quality*Speed*CompatibilityCons:*None so far"
4,Nice gift for a casual cake bakers!,"The set is good.. with all its tips, it is a good start for a casual cake bakers to decorate and get trained. I would say it is even good for a small cake business owners. 12 tips, 2 plastic coated cones and cleaning brush... wat eles u can expect for the money... Don't forget, they also provide a small booklet to kick start with that little cake gadget."
5,"PERFECT, BETTER THAN THE LEADING BRAND","THIS SET COMES WITH TWO COUPLINGS, AND TWO BAGS, THE BAGS ARE WASHABLE AND SEEMS DURABLE TO ME, AND THE 12 TIPS JUST OK. BETTER THAN WILTON."
2,periodically disconnects and reconnects,"At first when I got this USB hub, it seemed to work fine. But after a while, I noticed once in a while it would disconnect and reconnect all of the attached peripherals. This is not that bad for mice and keyboards, but is catastrophic for external hard drives, which is what I was using it for. Maybe it's just that I got a defective unit, but I would not buy this one again."
1,Not Another pat on Hanoi's back from a guilty American!,"If I am forced by my college professor to read another book by a journalist who went back and saw how great life is in Vietnam because America (and the South Vietnamese people) lost to Hanoi, I'm going to puke.If you want read a book by a person who actually lived there for three years after the Communist took over, and doesn't replay every played out how great it was that North Vietnam was ""united"" with South Vietnam, then read Shadows and Wind.If you want to get a real understanding of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people (this is a Vietnamese writing), then read The Bamboo Chest: An Adventure in Healing the Trauma of War. I think you'll find it very refreshing: unlike Mr. Graham who almost didn't survive the experience, I don't recall Mr. Lamb ever having spent eleven months in a Hanoi-run re-education camp to get the truth about Vietnam!"
1,Do not buy!,"Very disappointing. The size was significantly smaller than the other size 6 briefs I've bought, so it isn't comfortable. The figures are not the ones from the movie Happy Feet. Don't buy."
1,Outdated,"This book is written by an American in 1968. This means American brands, firms and addresses of more than 30 years ago are being used. It contains only 7 drawings, 46 low-quality black-and-white photo's and 4 low-quality colour photo's. There's loads and loads of text with hardly any paragraphing which makes it very hard to read.No doubt this book was a very good book at the time and it has clearly been written by an enthousiast with great knowledge, insight and experience. But nowadays you can choose from many other books with far more and better photo's and drawings containing more general and up to date information, which are much easier to read."
1,The Virginian,"I received the book and found that the last few pages were missing. I contacted the seller and was told to returned the book for a refund.I returned the book, received a nasty letter from the seller with no refund. The seller Jo Ann Tonks is not a honerable person."
4,handicap user of Dragon dictate classic 3.0,"I have used dragon dictate classic for over 6 years now. I am dictating this review as I must; being a quadriplegic without use of my hands. I have been very satisfied with this software and continue to use its features daily. Extremely good product with great voice recognition system and simple to train. I will upgrade with Dragon dictate products, the pause between each word does slow the dictateing speed, however, accuracy its great. Hopefully dragon dictate will integrate the ""command mode"" into their naturally speaking products. Once that's accomplished dragon dictate will be close to a perfect voice recognition system."
2,Too much science fiction,"I expected the books to be more like a Cussler novel, this was my first time to read a Rollins book. I found it too unbelivable and had too much science fiction in it for me. I have a few more books of Rollins that I was given, I will be reading those to see if the same style follows."
2,Ya...Right???,"One word describes this book:ridiculous- Deserving or inspiring ridicule; absurd, preposterous, or silly.In all fairness to the author this is the first book of his that I have read and perhaps I should have investigated more into his writing style. This book reads like a silly Hollywood movie. Most disappointing is that the story line and conceptuality of this book was very good but Rollins wears the reader down with absurd coincidences, unlimited resources and unbelievable creatures. Had he been more realistic in these areas this would have been an absorbing read."
2,Am I missing something?,"After reading 'Black Order', I feel in love and decided I wanted to read all of Rollins' books. I chose 'Amazonia' next based on its good reviews. I feel like I am missing something from this book that most of the other reviewers loved. I found this novel to be incredibly boring and cliched. A lot of the story, writing and dialogue was so cheesy. For example- there was one part where someone tossed something (can't remember what or why) to another character and when they caught it they said something like ""Junior year- varsity baseball"" I have heard this dumb line in so many 80's movies it made me cringe when I read it.The plot was slightly narrow too. I was really looking forward to different plot lines tying together like in 'Black Order' and a big surprise ending but there was nothing of that here.I'm not giving up on Rolling though. I am going to try 'Subterranean' next."
3,Predictable,"The book had lots of excitement, but was rather predictable. The good guys were perfect, while the bad guys were a little too vile for my taste. Also, the ""don't mess with humanity"" theme was hammered in a bit too much. Is it really ok to destroy an entire ecosystem just because we don't like it? Can an ecosystem be immoral?"
3,AN AMAZONIAN ADVENTURE!,"James Rollins' newest adventure tale takes us on a thrill ride filled with wonders of Mother Nature and freakish creatures. This was an all around good read, but SUBTERRANEAN to me, was far better in action, adventure, and pace.Now dont get me wrong, this novel is chock full of that too, but to me personally, it just did not reach that ""fever pitch"" that his 1st novel gave off. This one read very much like a very good movie at the theater than a novel.But, thats just my opinion. James Rollins always gives us a good romp in either genre in which he chooses to write, some are just better than others. This newest is by far better than last year's DEEP FATHOM though, and I know he has not yet reached his peak. Read this one for the sheer pleasure of an adventure story, but I warn you - the best is yet to come from this author! E-mail me Mr. Rollins/Clemens, you know I'm right."
4,An interesting adventure,"Like others have said, James Rollins reminds me of Dan Brown, in terms of the ""what if"" nature of his books. Amazonia was an interesting journey with well developed key characters."
3,story lost it's way,The story line started out with an interesting theme then quickly turned into dribble with outlandish beasts and fauna.in the story. To much gore .
2,Not his best work.,"I ordered Amazonia hot off the press as soon as I possibly could - hardcover, no less. Needless to say, I was disappointed. It was not, in my opinion, of the same page-turning, nail biting quality of his other novels. I'm a science fiction buff, but even I found the premise so hard to believe that it almost ruined it right off the bat. The plot was weak, the characters unbelievable, and, well, that whole giant panther thing was just too much. I think I'll wait and see if Mr. Rollins comes back down to earth before reading another one of his books."
5,[great] adventure!,"I can't believe that James Rollins, just gets better and better, but he does! 'Amazonia' is not only action-packed but full of rich characterizations. The thing I really admire about Mr. Rollins is his use of known science and taking just beyond the edge of understanding. Kudos!"
1,I am an unhappy customer...,"My beef is not with the product, but the business entity that sold it. The product description clearly states pack of ten, which I indeed thought was too good of a deal to pass up. However, I only received two cameras. I emailed Electronic World last week and no one has responded. My event is now less than two weeks away and I have many other agendas to tend to. This should not have happened to me and should not happen to anyone else, ever. I don't want my money back; I just want my other eight cameras. I can't believe that I have been ripped off and no one will do anything about it."
3,Good principles but difficult to implement for me,"I'm a 52 years old recreational runner who runs some 1/2 marathons and occasional 10K races. My times have deterioreted a lot since 1987 so I get the book to learn more.The training is based on vDOT and you need a track or a measured path to know exactly what time you need to run it.How about to run 400m repetitions 6 sek faster then VO2Max pace ? Or LT-runs 15 sek per km slower then 10k race pace ?Daniels is not a friend of HRM training. Watch is his tool. His training principles, utilising enviroment etc are very usefull though. His programs are best suited for competitive runners.There are only a few word mentioned for people like me for whom a 1/2 marathon takes the same time as full marathon for elite.So I'l stick to a HRM training. I'd just purchased ""Heart Monitor Training for the Compleat Idiot"" here.Good luck! Josef"
3,Too bad,"Jessica Simpson started out as the most believable and refreshing of the teen queens in late 1999 with her semi-sweet debut Sweet Kisses. Sadly, though, her career didn't have much momentum...until 2003's PR-ready MTV Newlyweds show that truly propelled her to insta-stardom. Soon after she received Britney Spears popularity status, but last December decided, shockingly, to divorce first love and Newlyweds co-star Nick Lachey. Overall, the final season of Newlyweds is a 4-star release because, although it does have its moments, it's not horrible, but it ain't good either...but Jessica Simpson is no longer known for her so-called ""talent"" (something she possessed first, but lacks vocally now--I mean, can you say ""off key""?!) but for her party-heavy celebrity antics. Simpson has become an annoying tabloid queen for becoming famous for something she no longer is: married. Too bad, too, because she had potential."
5,LOVED This movie!,"If I were ten again, this would be on my TV all day everyday. I grew up in the Labyrinth/ Dark Crystal/Willow etc generation, and this goes right up there! What a classic, kid friendly tale. Even if you've never read the books ( or your kids have never read them) its still a really good story with some life lessons intertwined with fairies and goblins.Loved it."
3,The Spiderwick Chronicles,"Good bed tiem story..Disappointed with Director Mark Waters, It is not good enough as family movie.."
3,Could've been a contender,"This is a good solid piece of film-making. It could have been great story telling but the writing fell disappointingly flat. The ensemble was stellar, but struggled against a so-so script; i.e., a rushed conclusion as if the director and screenplay writer got bored with the project. The movie did well in spite of itself. The SFX were terrific and the gnomes, demons and things that go bump in the night blended into the scenery and dialogue seamlessly.You won't be disappointed in the movie for popcorn-munching-in-the-living-room entertainment. But if you're a fan of the books, you know the movie has just skimmed the surface of possibilities. Let's hope for another Spiderwick movie with more spirit and heart than its parent-film. In the meantime, keep your salt and tomato sauce handy."
4,Good Movie. Not A classic.,"I do not know the books. But the movie is well made, It just lacks originality. You get the feeling you saw those things before. I suppose with so many movies around it is hard to be original. However, the movie does hold the viewer interest and has good entertainment value. I wish the fight scenes would have been toned-down to accommodate a wider range of audience."
3,"It almost made it, but not quite.","Never having read the books, & in fact I'd never even heard of them until I started to see the trailers for the movie, I thought 'The grandkids might enjoy this one?'Even if they did, I felt that there was too much of the tale which had not been told.Maybe if I did know the story; but then those who have read the book/s complain that it wasn't true to the script either, so it's the old book to film dilemma: what to keep, what to change (however little - or much), & what to leave out completely.I think that too much was left out, leaving it an incomplete viewing experience for me at least.Still worth a watch though."
1,Spiderwick Chronicles,"When I purchased this item I saw no indication that it might not be suitable for young children. The child I intended to give it to is 7 years old and he was looking forward to seeing the movie. I like to review movies before giving to my grandchildren. This is definitely not suitable for a young child!!! The story itself is interesting but the movie is too graphic and would lead to some children experiencing nightmares. I think items that you sell should be denoted as suitable or non-suitable for young children. Of course if you follow the Hollywood criteria for suitability I would reject many PG-13 rated items, since some are too graphic for even a 13 year old! Be brave! Design a decent rating system for parents and grandparents to review!"
2,Boring... horrible music scoring,"No real plot or progression. And the worst part is that theDavid Foster Love Theme instrumental is repeated again and againand again and again... maybe dozens of times. It was okay onceor twice, but they way over did it. Rent only if you likethe 'brat pack'."
3,not the best,"while this movie may not b the best that the 80's had to offer, it had a good cast, and an okay storyline."
3,FUN AND FULL OF HEART!,"In this engaging offering, the popular Sesame Street star plays a wealthy philanthropist who opens a much-needed orphanage deep in the worst end of the Bronx. In a graceful gesture, the children give their furry benefactor the nickname, ""St. Elmo,"" only to turn on him when their new home mysteriously burns to the ground, (hence the title of the movie). Did Elmo set the fire for the insurance money, or is someone trying to frame him? A dejected Elmo must go on the lam to clear his name, and while this is clearly the most ""adult"" of the Elmo features, the entire family should enjoy this entertaining hybrid of ""The Muppet Movie"" and ""The Fugitive."""
1,No fire...It left me cold,"Just another movie about some young adults facing their usual problems with relationships, college life and future choices. Nothing new here, not too interesting or enjoyable either, so it did nothing for me. It's not very funny and at times turns into weak melodrama, revolving around tired, been-done-to-death cliches with lifeless characters. The director Joel Schumacher can do better than this (the somewhat innovative ""Phone Booth"" or the gripping ""Tigerland"") or downright bad stuff (""Batman and Robin""). This is just bland and forgettable, I guess I`ll pass."
2,They're ok for kids,"I'm a boxing trainer and also a fighter, these mitts do not have a lot of padding. Which is why I only use them when teaching my kids' boxing class. When I take any of my amateur fighters on them, they just spew small pieces of foam all over my clothes and the ring. I would not reccomend these for anyone who is training adults, they won't hold up and you will definitely feel numb after holding them for a heavy hitter, arthritis and carpal tunnel will sneak up on you faster than Mayweather's jab."
2,"Cheap, Weak no Padding",These mitts have the padding of a cardboard box. They are cheap and from Everlast I expected much more. These mitts now have a place in my garage unused. Go with a brand that actually takes time like Aires or Revgear. These Everlast mitts are just horribly made with cheap substitutes for padding and use.
3,"Good skillet, Bad handle.","Silcone rubber wraped handle ,too low of an angle to it. I have been buying Revere Skillet's and they have all had problems. I think it is because I am buying the largest ones. The handle on the first stainless steel skillet broke off, I returned to the outlet store and all they could do was down grade me to aluminum. It had a strong handle, but I wanted SS, so I bought this skillet to replace it. Another problem arouse after a year of use. The rubber wrapping on the handle came loose. It is still usable if you remove the rubber, but this results in a thin handle. The angle of its handle is unusual because it comes straight out from the side, which may/may not be a problem for users. The non-stick surface is great for cooking, but don't use any metal utensils with edges because it will scratch the coating."
1,Shameful,"This book is a shameful end to an otherwise wonderful series of women in the lineage of Christ. It is poorly researched, and extremely disrespectful of the Mother of God. Think about it - Mary is the vessel through which God was made man and came to earth. Doesn't it make sense that the vessel would be as perfect as is humanly possibly? I was shocked and offended by this book. What a shame."
1,Worst Christian Book!,"Francine Rivers has St. Mary, our Mother of Jesus, having other children with St. Joseph. The book should have never been published ever as Christian Fiction.The writer should not change Christians' beliefs so freely.Brothers and sisters are common words in the bible. Priests call us brothers and sisters, and that does not mean we are biologically related. The bible has mentioned Jesus as firstborn; but that does not mean there were more children. Also, if there would be more children, we would know about them from the bible. I was shocked and very disappointed that this story was ever published as Christian fiction. Such blemishes about our HOLY MOTHER should never go to the press."
5,Great Product.....Read the Instructions,"This works exactly as advertised.You need to give yourself a trim first with a normal shaver. Once you are just down to short stubble then you break out this Wahl Bump-Free shaver. It'll get it down to feeling very smooth.Don't use this to try to shave off your beard. That's not what it is for. First get a close trim with stubble using some other trimmer. Then use this one.I've been very pleased with how it works.After a while, the foil will break up. You can get a replacement. You don't need to replace the entire shaver."
5,excellent product,i cuts such as indicated very light comfortable to use long battery life i charge once a month and I use it twice a weekI recommend
5,Great shaver,What can I say about a Wahl shaver. I had one before and loved it. That's why I didn't hesitate one minute to buy this one. If and when it wears out I'll buy another one. Great service on the shipping too.
4,It gets the job done.,"This is my second time purchasing this shaver. The other one still works, however, I had to order another one because I broke the adapter and you cant purchase the adapter by itself. I must say, as a black male this is probably the closest shave you will get without major irritation. I still get a few razor bumps, but nothing like if I were using a razor. When using this shaver I typically have to trim my facial hair first with my t-edjer, without trimming first the bump free shaver won't trim/cut your facial hair. The t-edjer gets it low enough for you to use the bump free shaver. All in all, I would have to say it gets the job done well enough for you to step out the house with a clean shave. I wish there was something better, but I think this is as good as it gets for African-American males. I hope this helps."
1,Terrible buy,Does a terrible job shaving. It left my head with cuts all over. Used it once and will never again. Best way is to use a Mach 3 razor and shaving cream. DO NOT WAST YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!
1,Doesn't function like my old one,I had purchased one prior to this one and loved it. I lost it and purchased another. The hair trimmer doesn't stay fully engaged and doesn't function properly
4,I recommend this shaver,"When I first came to us my girlfriend who is my wife now bought me a remington shaver I used it twice and gave it to my brother in law in Haiti because that shaver gave me too many bumps . I'm using the andi's shaver which is bumpless for more than 15 years, but it doesn't shave my face close enough. In fact, two months ago my real barber wasn't at the shop ,and I dicided to use a different one who used the ""Wahl shaver"" this did not burn my skin ; curiously, I asked him what's the brand of this shaver he said Whal. Then after a few days I did not notice any bumps. This week, tuesday 3th,2010 the same barber used the wahl shaver and I do not have any problem; that's right I came on line to check on the price of these great shavers. I still don't have one yet, but I'll definitely buy it when the money comes."
2,Not good with long beards.,I had to use this along another razor to get to the level that is appropriate. Too cumbersome to have to use both.
3,Just OK,This shaver is ok. It is not as good as Remington's old Black Man's Shaver. It does not cut the single strands of fine hair. It does cut short stubble well. For the money though it does ok.
2,The sorriest sight in town,"This Elvis Presley soundtrack was recorded on June 28 & 29, 1966. Nine songs were taped. The songs are not very good. The single from the album was ""Long Legged Girl (With The Short Dress On)"", which only got to #63 on the Hot 10. Because nine songs aren't enough for an album, three ""bonus"" songs from 1963 were added to the LP. These songs are far superior to the actual movie songs. Several new bonus songs were added to this ""deluxe edition"" of the album, which are all alternate takes of the movie songs. Unfortunately, most of the alternate takes are in mono, because they were unable to find the original 3-track tapes for the songs recorded on June 29. There are alternate takes for all of the songs except for ""Old MacDonald"" . These alternate takes will only be of interest to hardcore Elvis fans, who are the only people who would pay the high price for this CD anyway."
5,An affirmation of the power of prayer,"Rosemary Ellen Guiley presents 150 specific cases of how prayer worked for people in distress. The stories are taken from the files of Silent Unity, the telephone prayer ministry of the Unity School of Christianity. They include examples of prayer requests and results in the areas of healing, prosperity and protection. A special chapter on prayers involving pets provides an interesting aspect of how prayer works. An uplifting, comforting book on the power of united and sustained prayer."
4,Informative!,I saw only one reference to the Peace Corps in the index. 1968 was a year in which the number of American Peace Corps Volunteers were at their zenith. Peace Corps Volunteers were serving in large numbers in Iran and Afghanistan in 1968. Both of these countries were displaying civility in this crucial year. There was little civil unrest in either nation at that time. This is juxtaposed to the riots in much of Western Europe and the USA. Such is this dichotomy.
1,"Cynical, sly and revisionist","This guy is really ""stuck in the '60's"", or rather what he thought the sixties were like when he was a naive youth. Many people tend to idealize their younger days, but to pass their fantasies off as history is a disgraceful act. It is also blatantly false and misleading. This author sounds and smells (at least intellectually if not actually) like some of the guys with grey, greasy ponytails that caused me to leave The Jersey Boys early in disgust last year. I lived through the sixties too, and it's time we all got over it."
4,it's in the details,"Very detailed mostly political account of the year. A lot of flashbacks to the earlier Sixites, e.g. Mario Savio and the Berkeley Free Speech movement, as well as events in Europe. Generally excellent. If you are expecting a lot of music and pop culture references you could be a little disappointed."
4,A fun history but a fun historian,Kurlansky is usually known for writing more off the wall histories so I was fairly surprised to see this one. Despite his eclectic nature this book is very well done and really highlights how 1968 was a defining year for the world. From riots in the United States to the Prague Spring Kurlansky goes through the traumatic events of the year. He ties them together and although he does not offer a definite thesis it still makes for interesting reading.
3,Not one of the best in the series,I owned the frist 2nd 3rd this one and whatever number the new generation is this one was a bit more comady then horror when the plastic bird rocks off and impales onto the old women really made me and my girlfreind laugh.
1,WTH?!!!,"It's bad enough we have to deal with the Lohan family in the news just about every day of the week, but now this? It just goes to prove that anybody with a large amount of cash can pay to have their little no-talent child warble into a studio mic. I'm sure the tech's worked overtime to make this presentable, but they're not miracle workers. This ended up in one of my yard sales and I couldn't even give it away and FYE wouldn't take it. This is THE perfect gag or white elephant gift for that poor unfortunate soul. I wouldn't pay more than a dollar for this, and that's paying too much!!"
1,Why does this poor girl think she is talented??,"They have been trying to shove this girl's ""talent"" down our throats for too long. Ali, if you read this, get on with a normal life. They're lying to you. You are not going to be rich and famous. And that's the truth!"
5,Hysterical,"I was delighted to discover Christopher Buckley. His satire is dead-on and laugh-out-loud funny. I've enjoyed ""Little Green Men"" and ""Wet Work"" just as much.For anyone who's tired of waiting for Carl Hiaasen's next book, you'll find Mr. Buckley just as entertaining - and more topical."
4,I didn't want to like it....,"I really didn't want to like it. I wasn't so sure about reading from this perspective, was worried that it would be pro-smoking or try to make a cliched attempt at being anti-smoking. And while I felt the ending and the big switchover was a bit contrived and quick, I enjoyed the book.I was a bit angry at becoming so involved with the main character, but it happened instantly when his major incident took place. I wasn't sure what my morals were doing, but my readerly instincts had me engaged with the character. As soon as that happened, I was able to enjoy the light and sometimes humorous style of Christopher Buckley and make guesses as to which way the plot was going. I enjoyed the unravelling of it all.All in all, a good read."
5,The funniest man alive!,Completely hilarious and far more insightful about contemporary politics than anything you'll find on the editorial page.
5,This distributor is EASY to install and it works great!,There really are only a few wires to hook up once you drop the distributor in. The installation couldn't have been any easier. The engine fired right up and it has performed flawlessly since I put it in.
3,Ert...,"I picked this book up randomly at some out-of-the-way used book store a few weeks ago- I origionally (that word shouldn't even be in the English language- it's impossible to spell correctly) thought that it would be some cheesy marine adventure novel... it exceeded my expectations by its ...really nifty plot. The parts with the dolphins were really creative... and got me to thinking... I'd suggest this book to anyone whose mind doesn't wander too easily... Maybe I should get a dolphin. And on the subject of gigantic man-eating sharks... would you give one love and care while it was trying to eat everything living (and non-living) in sight, including you? Very nifty book. Go Wolfpack!"
5,Simply put---Awesome Product,"I considered all the major kitchen faucet manufacturers and the deciding factor in my purchase was the magnet docking system offered by Delta. No plastic parts to wear out, ever! No doubt Delta has a patent on this system leaving the competition scratching their heads, how to compete? Installation instructions were straight forward and concise. Absolutely no drips following installation. Spray performance is great and with the center spray aerator no splashing. Pulling the spray head out the tube is effortless and better yet the heavy counter weight on the hose (under the sink) makes for even easier re-docking the head into the faucet tube. Nice chrome finish, really brightens up the kitchen in our 120 year old home. Highly recommended from an amateur chef.Be sure to double check you are getting the Leland with the magnet system, my first shipment came in without it, evidently it was the older Leland, which is probably why it was $30 cheaper than the next dealer price."
3,poor packing,"When this candy arrived the candy inside of the box had been tossed about and were out of the papers for the indivudal pieces. The packing was very poor and the candy did not taste fresh. I have eaten Sees candy for years and love it, but this is a great diappointment."
5,The courage to be believe in oneself,"Twenty years ago I was given Fountainhead and told it would be a life forming read. For anyone searching to believe in their own ability, I recommend this book, and Atlas Shrugged, for the courage they portray."
2,dissapointing,"I found Jacki Lyden's book about her life with her bi-polar mother very dissapointing. I must give credit where credit is due, Ms. Lyden has a wonderful writing style and appears to have led a fascinating life, but I finished the book with a strong sense of dissapointment. Ms. Lyden's story did not answer the questions I had about her feelings about the real possibility that she could fall prey to the genetic disease that her mother suffered from. Nor did she leave the reader with any sense of sympathy for her. I felt that she portrayed herself as a martyred character who had an inflated sense of self. The callous description of Ms. Lyden's abortion and her endless trivial details about her ""rodeo job"" caused me to dislike the book even more. I had high expectations for this book, but I was left feeling unfulfilled."
2,Sad and Predictable,"Prior to reading this book, I read reviews which proclaimed this book as being ""A Masterpiece."" I will say that the topic of the book is SAD and Depressing and my heart goes out to anyone that has experienced what the author has written. I felt so depressed chapter after chapter. The book seemed to be getting worse the deeper I read and I was unable to complete the last 3 chapters without a good, strong, stiff drink.....And I don't even drink."
2,Ok at best...a bit too elementary,"Book could have explained the same theories in a third the pages with much less insult to my intelligence. Very simple. Not worth the time or money in my opinion. Prefer Fish! for similar thoughts and life lessons. Fish! is a worthwhile read this is not. I agree with the thoughts and concepts this book teaches, just not the method of delivery."
3,Wonderful but not as good as his other books,"Harvey Mackey is a great writer who usually explains extremely helpful ways to become better in business. Especially because his options are very practical and easily implemented. However this book was more anecdotal and not as easy to implement. He basically says get a rolodex, and be nice to everyone. If you want more useful tips for Networking, look elsewhere."
4,"The Right Person, At The Right Time, At the Right Place","Few people can be as lucky as Timothy Garton Ash. I've read his book ""We The People"" which I believe to be the same with this book. The book is divided into chapters concerning the ""refolutions"" (as Ash calls them) in Poland, Hungary, East Germany, and Czechoslovakia. In the last 2 chapters, Ash makes a very good analysis and comparison of these 4 revolutions. If you would like to get a comprehensive idea about how these revolutions in these 4 states came out, then this book is absolutely for you. The book has certain details which cannot be found in any other book."
5,Good,"Good product for a reasonable price, helps keep the pH down in my tank every now and then when I do water changes."
3,Poirot solves yet another case,"What's not to like? It's another in the hit series Hercule Poirot starring David Suchet. When there' nothing worth watching on TV, which is usually the case, a Hercule Poirot mystery can always fit the bill! Too bad there's not additional new films in the works, there's certainly plenty of fans for it!"
1,Don't buy this!!!,"My 4 year old daughter recently aquired quite a few Polly Pocket items for her birthday and we were looking for a case to put them in. This seemed like a good idea until we got home. The insets on the doors are made of cardboard and aren't very sturdy. Also the Polly on the front that is supposed to ""lock"" the case is constantly falling off. And don't even waste your time putting items in the cute little drawers because your going to have to take all of the drawers out of the case in order to get the clothes out anyways. All of the clothes fell out of the drawers and got stuck underneath them. Oh, and the ""cute"" handle is very rickety. Don't waste your money. Our case went back to the store the very next day, and we bought the Polly Pocket Carrying case that you can throw everything in and zip it up. It works much better and costs a lot less."
1,Horribly made,"I've never reviewed an item before, but this carrycase is so horrible I feel compelled to do just that. It stinks. The drawers are hard to open. The drawers fall out. The doors fall off. The doors don't stay closed. If you're buying this for a child under say, the age of 5, they won't be into organizing all the Polly stuff into separate little drawers anyway. You're better off just putting everything in a Tupperware container! Don't buy this!!!!!"
1,Don't Buy It!,We bought this item for our daughter for Christmas. It was a big mistake that we will never make again. The plastic drawers tip back and the items fall out. You have to remove the drawer to get to the items that fell behind it. This is a big hassle for the parents since a four year can't do it on their own. We thought it would be great for keeping our daughter's polly pockets organized while we travel and in the house . . . Boy were we wrong! Don't buy this product. It's a waste of money. It's better to go out and purchase a multiple drawer storage unit for CD's than this cheap rolling storage unit.
1,Cheap piece of junk,"I'd echo the negative things others have said - I've already returned mine. Front door broke off the first time we opened it, as did the Polly figure on the door. We've always liked the little Polly figurines and clothes, but this (as well as the House of Style - I think that's what it was called) was junk.By the way, we replaced it with a generic pink sparkly tacklebox thing that my daughter has loved and gives many more sorting options!"
5,Greenwood has done it again!,Elminster is a delightfully colorful character with a magical life a reader could best experience by the illustration of Ed Greenwood. Excellent story and great reading for FR fans! My single gripe is the very difficult to pronounce Elven names.
3,Interesting but a bit confusing,"I found this book rather dry and predictable. It was very confusing in places, as all wording was in an old english styling. It left me wondering, in parts, what exactly Elminster was doing, or why he was doing something. Another aspect of the book was the fact that he was pretty much superior in all ways. I realise being ""The Chosen"" of Mystra has its advantages, but every time he invoked the goddesses name she answered. It seems to me that she would like to see her ""Chosen"" to solve things on his own. This makes him to powerful, leading to a rather dry story. The book is nice to read, for those players and DM's in the AD&D Forgotten Realms game, to know where the greatest mage in the realms came from, but for plain readers of fantasy I would not recommend it."
3,1001 Tips for Buing and Selling a Home,"The book was well organized and provided good tips for all aspects of selling a house. In my case, much of the information was already familiar to me. I did pick up some good pointers, though"
1,Much better beginners books out there,I recommend the idiots guides or guides for dummies.Almost all of the recomendations in here are pretty obvious. So unless you aren't so bright and don't have common sense I would look elsewhere.
1,PDE section is too few pages and too much engineer jargon,"A goal of Wilmott's book is to ""gently"" introduce Quantitative finance (derivatives and their pricing) to non-quants( or wanna be quants)Wilmott puts cute drawings to help the reader feel the subject matter is not so scary, but I need the simplest clearest writting possible and many simple(as possible) examples, not just cute pictures.In his chapter that introduces PDE's , Wilmott starts talking ""engineer ease"" within the first few sentences, and I assume Wilmott thinks he is being clear to the non-quant reader. Wrong! The chapter has too much jargon.The book doesn't go too deep into math, but it's still notclear on the material it attempts to explain.However, the CD has some nice Excel examples on pricing,provided you are already familiar with the pricing models used."
5,Great! A book to be read & reread!,Great! Alcorn's picture of Heaven. Helps us to remember where the Christian's home is. You will read & reread it!
4,The Fight for Today's Culture,"I am a big fan of the ministry of Randy Alcorn. Having read and enjoyed Ted Dekker's fiction I decided to try Randy Alcorn's fiction. Deadline"" takes place on earth plus heaven and hell. The three dimensions are fascinating and the comparisons are stunning. Hell is depicted as a place that is absence God, not surprising to non-believers, but also absent all God gives which is quite a shock to the inhabitants. The plot is interesting and tricked me up but I found it too often turned into a bit of a sermon. The book I recommend far more than ""Deadline"" is ""Heaven"" by Randy Alcorn."
5,AWWW-YEAH!,Wow! What a book! My husband and I read it together and so it was kind of anoying to have to wait for him to have time to finish up some of the more suspenseful parts. Great book. Great language. Wonderful descriptions. Coming from the Northwest it seemed like it was taking place in my backyard.
2,Talk of shoving Christianity down one's throat,"I purchased this book because of the numerous positive reviews. I was sorely disappointed.The hit-over-the-head preaching and the black and white characterizaions were so pathetically blatant (apparently attempting to set Jake on his path to redemption) that I was ready to scream. From this point on, I will take a major step away from authors pushing Christian themes.If the goal is to inspire or to garner more souls toward the concepts of Christianity, please consider trying some subtle sophistication and not ""write down"" to your audience."
3,Better Shape than This?,"I thought I would be getting a New book, but it seems it has been used. It arrived in a manila envelope with no protection and the envelope was slightly beaten up. Could have been better packed before sending. I have no issues with the story. It's a very good one."
4,Unspoken,"This is a hard book to read, in many ways. It shows the devastation which happens when we allow coveteousness to grow and are not nurturing contentment and faith in God's provision for ourselves. It is very realistic, one of the earmarks of F. Rivers' books. The presumptions about how the breakdown of David's family happened is very insightful. Though, again, this is one person's ideas of the details of a true story. It should be held as just that. I was a little disappointed in the view of David, as the man. So often, the men are held with a kind of.. almost condescending tolerance... We women must fight that attitude! It is not God-honoring. But on the whole, the book is a good one."
4,A good read!,"A story that one can relate to. How mistakes can be made and forgiven. Always enjoy reading her books, where so much is revealed about our history."
1,"Oh, Please","If you want to read a great and unflinchingstudy of addiction without the whining, read Hubert Selby Jr.'sRequiem for a Dream. 'Nuff said."
1,a bore,"At the outset, I found this book readable because of Wurtzel's laughably bad writing. It was almost fascinating how someone with nothing to recommend her could be so grandiose and egomaniacal. At one point early in the book she even compares herself to a vietnam vet, and says that if you haven't been a vietnam vet, that you don't know what it feels like to be her. Excuse me, but has she ever been a vietnam vet? However, such stupidity, after page 50 or so, simply becomes intolerable. To think that drivel likes this gets published, and sometimes even praised!"
1,until you weep,"Ha ha ha ha ha, Ha ha ha ha ha, Ha ha ha ha ha, Ha ha ha ha ha, Ha ha ha ha ha, Ha ha ha ha ha, Ha ha ha ha ha, Ha ha ha ha ha, Ha ha ha ha ha, Ha ha ha ha ha, Ha ha ha ha ha, Ha ha ha ha ha, Ha ha ha ha ha, Ha ha ha ha ha, Ha ha ha ha ha, Ha ha ha ha ha, Ha ha ha ha ha, Ha ha ha ha ha, Ha ha ha ha ha, Ha ha ha ha ha.Okay, maybe I'm not being fair. I take away one ""Ha."" Either way, this book is still an utter joke."
1,"Yes: more, now, again!","Next time you're cleaning out the bathroom medicine cabinet, put all your leftover prescription meds in an envelope and send them to the author of this book. Because if Wurtzel stays clean and sober, then where will the world turn to for more penetrating prose on the dark mysteries of addiction?"
1,Yet another example of Wurtzel's terrible writing abilities,"I am amazed Elizabeth Wurtzel's ability to write 300-page memoirs about her problems. Her first book, Prozac Nation, was a rambling story of a typical experience with depression that she felt was spectacular solely because it happened to her. In More, Now, Again , Wurtzel tells the story of her (rather uneventful) addiction in a manner that suggests that she has Been Through It All. I am unimpressed."
3,"A decent read, but not as good as Prozac Nation","After reading Prozac Nation and liking it, I decided to pick up this book. Being a guy, I find it a good read but I felt both very non-sympathetic and non-chalant about the terrible situations the author gets herself into over and over again. What starts off as a good read quickly devolves into watching the author play out an intellectualized version of the blame game, using long-drawn explanations and excuses for everything wrong in her life. There's lots of ""Why Me Me Me!"" going on on her end, but that's understandable given her condition.All in all, this book is mildly interesting at best, and a pity Party at worst."
3,"Poor Little, 6itch Girl","Okay, so at least this was better than ""Prozac Nation"", but seriously Miss Wurtzel, can we put away the ego and inferiority complex for one minute?The recount of her slip into addiction was interesting, not Wurtzel's story, but the process of her transitioning into a full-blown addict. The sad part is that once she got clean, I couldn't stand her.I would recommend borrowing this from the library, but not buying it. It was just okay."
2,Time to grow up,"Poor me, poor me, pour me another drink. Or in her case get me some more coke. I am in recovery myself, and I find this book to be more reflective of someone who has borderline or some kind of personality disorder, in addition to substance abuse. The only way to say this is that the author is simply unlikable. Not at all like the other books I have read about recovery. This woman needs to get over herself. She is at least 30 in the book and she keeps refering to herself as a girl and as having boy problems. Some feminist she makes. She is not someone that I would aspire to be like in my recovey, as a career women or as a so called feminist. When she said she would be more honest as a stripper she got it right. People read her books because she was attractive not because of her writing ability. Lets see how she does as she ages."
5,Great service great book,I bought this book used and it came in great shape. The service was prompt and had nice packaging. This is such a great book especially for someone who has problems with addiction. I highly recommend this book. Great read.
2,Not impressed,"For the price I guess this is value for money. But the wool is not that great, the cut is long and straight (curves around the hips and stretches down to the ankle, I'm a 5""4) and i'm still trying to figure what this actually goes with. Didn't return coz' it was a few bucks but I could have done without this."
5,A True Inspiration,"From the beginning of the book I felt as though I knew each and every person. The story was told with such down to earth, heartfelt emotions that I felt what the author was trying to convey. This is not fiction, but real emotions told in such a beautiful and touch way. The positive manner in which the author faces the challanges in his life is true inspiration and guide for living."
1,"worked great, then died","The region free worked great in Japan for region 1 and 2 dvds the first year. In a little over a year of infrequent use the door started to jam then the dvds began to freeze, have disc errors, skip or not play at all. So, now, I need a new one, but it wont be this one again."
3,There were nice aspects to the book.,"The first third of this book convinced me that I was meant to live in romantic Tuscany. The second third of the book convinced me that if I was to buy a villa, I would not endlessly, tediously Americanize it! I couldn't bring myself to plod through the last third of the book.The descriptions of Mayes' arrival in Tuscany and purchase of a summer home were delightful. The gardens and the food sounded absolutely scrumptious! The recipes look wonderful. So cut the writing in half and add more recipes, and the book would be perfect... and we would be spared the pretentiousness of the author."
1,Disappointing,"Lyrically written but ultimately quite disappointing. Unfortunately I have to agree with other readers who found this book pretentious and self indulgent.A vastly superior book about authentic Tuscan country life and food is Elizabeth Romer's The Tuscan Year.Tim Parks, a British author, and Paul Hoffman, the former Roman bureau chief for the NYT, have written a number of books about their lives as expatriates in Italy--Parks lives in the Veneto and Hoffman in Rome. Their books are keenly insightful and thought provoking and well worth reading."
3,Un Bel Libro...A Beautiful Book,"Frances Mayes delivers for her readers an animated, lyrical, luscious memoir of her decision to purchase and renovate a house in Cortona, Italy.If you are at all interested in Italy or traveling this book will delight you and make you envious of the life she is carving out in Tuscany.Unfortunately, if you are looking for a gripping drama you will be quite bored with Mayes' descriptions of her meals, shopping excursions, home renovations and the visits to Etruscan tombs.I found myself wandering at certian points in the book as some of descriptions of the house renovations got just a little too wordy, but I was always pulled back into the story by another description of the townspeople, dinners at the town restaurants, churches or the surrounding towns.An enjoyable read, where Mayes creates a vivid imagery of the Italian countryside and beautiful prose that let's the reader into her most private thoughts."
2,Nothing Like the Movie,"I bought this book after watching the movie which I loved. I usually find that when a book is made into a movie, that I prefer the book. Not in this case though. The book is so very different than the movie. It reads more like a travelog, not much of a story. I also thought the chapter with the recipes was weird.If you just want to read a travel diary than you won't be disappointed. The author makes Italy sound wonderful. If you are expecting a story similar to the movie, forget it."
1,Self-Absorbed Twaddle-No Peter Mayle!,"I have read a lot of the ""lets move to a foreign country and buy a house and live in it"" books over the years, and this one is by far the worst of the bunch. Indeed, about half way through I just put the book down and could not finish it...it is just that bad.A lot of the other reviewers who did not like this book have summarized quite well the points which also strike a chord with me, so all I can say is if you want a good book about country life in Italy, get ""Extra Virgin"" and have a good time reading the book and at least you can identify with the writer, and actually learn something rather than be slathered with pretentious musings. I for one am not interested in someone who is so self-absorbed. Most persons who have typical jobs and responsibilities and budgets to manage just have a hard time identifying with this author."
2,Boring after a few chapters,Gets boring and very predictable after the first couple of chapters. A very American view of Europe I would say.
3,I need romance when the subject is Italy...,"Mayes did a great job with detail regarding the restoration of her new summer home...even so much that I too dreamt of owning a Tuscany home where olives and pinnoli nuts were only steps away in my own backyard, but i thought Italy was a land of romance?!? I don't even care if she lied to me about romantic endeavors, but if she had just put half the effort she put into the construction of the house into her marriage or her own personal growth, it would have been a more enjoyable read. This is something they did together to find solace and i do not get a ""togetherness"" vibe at all. Emotions are something we all encounter, especially i would assume, had i bought a new villa with my husband in the country we adored. WHERE ARE THEY? :("
4,"Grub, Grubbing & Grubbiness","My goodness - she does eat a lot! And she does go on a bit too long about the Etrucans in the middle of the book ... and (as others have commented) she is a little 'wordy'. But apart from that, she certainly conjures up the lifestyle, the countryside & the FEEL of Italy - sorry, the feel of TUSCANY - quite unlike other parts of Italy. At times I could almost smell the air filled with the scent of hay, peaches & herbs. We have relatives there with friends who renovated an old house - she could have been describing their place, on the same hillside! If you haven't been to Tuscany, this will make you wish to be there ..."
3,Enjoyable Escape,"I'm not one to pick up books that have been made into movies. Under the Tuscan Sun is one I bought ages ago and after a trip to Tuscany, decided to give it a go.I'm not disappointed. Frances Mayes writes a lovely story of how she and her husband came to own a home in Italy, and how they came to learn the region, the dialect, and the people. Mayes has a way of talking to her readers that draws them in gently, allowing them to peek into her life without disturbing the inhabitants.What the book lacks is perhaps a reason for being. While it read like a novel, the story is more of a travelog/diary than a story. Still, anyone looking for quiet escapism or relaxing bedtime reading can't go wrong with this one."
3,Note from a Tuscan dweller,"As a woman born from an American mother and a Hungarian father who was raised as an Italian in Florence, I feel close to the city itself and close to seeing Tuscany with sympathetic eyes. Thus I read ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" with interest. Is is well written and goes down like a nice glass of Chianti. But it struck me as idealized --not a fantasy-- but a wish to experience a world without feeling its weight or difficulty or costs for people who are really part of the texture. I have recently finished another book on Italy called ""Mother Tongue, An American Life in Italy"" that tells a much more complicated story. For people who are turists --they may not enjoy its richness and even pain-- because tourists are looking for simple experiences. But for readers who would like to know what it feels like to live in Italy as an American I would suggest this book by Wallis Wilde Menozzi. As a person who knows Italy, it struck me as challenging and true."
4,Tuscany is calling my name...,"This book was completely different from the movie - but I really liked it! It didn't hurt that I was reading it when it was cold and gray out (and dreaming of Tuscany).The author writes a lovely story of how she and her husband find a beautiful home in Italy and restore it (it's in shambles, just like the movie). The descriptions of Italian culture were riveting and, of course, lots of mouthwatering descriptions of food and alfresco meals. The biggest problem of the book, I think, is that it's more of a diary that rambles all over the place. But other than that, it's pure delicious escapism, and who doesn't love that?"
4,"Burt Wolf-esque, Bob Villa-ee, Martha Stewart-does-Tuscany","I wanted to travel, but with neither the time nor the money, I instead ordered Under the Tuscan Sun from Amazon. Transported by the pages of this book to Tuscany, I peered over the shoulder of an insightful English prof as she tackles the tedium of a major renovation project i.e. turn one ancient stone farmhouse into a cozy vacation home. Mayes sprinkles Italian words, phrases, recipes, history, and architectuere into this narrative like so many almonds in biscotti.She renovates and (I guess simultaneously) writes of her adventure with a Martha Stewart-ish enthusiasm for a Bob Villa-scale project that even Burt Wolf would enjoy visiting.This book was fun to read. But I couldn't resist adding a modicum of humor to the customer comments at the Amazon site after so much syrup had been spilt. I'm sure Martha would rinse a clean towel in warm water and clean up the mess. Me? I just add jokes on top."
2,"No insight, substance or even humor -- not worth the time",The author has no insight into the people or the countryside of Tuscany. She rambles and rambles without providing substance or interest. I was very disappointed having hoped for something as fun and insightful as Peter Mayle's A Year in Provence. I am leaving for Tuscany with a group of friends and told thme not to bother with this book.I love to read but this was work...
1,Italian Phrase Primer might have been a better title.,I found this book to be very aggravating with Italian words and phrases constantly interjected. It totally took away from the momentum. I would not purchase another book by Ms. Mayes. She got extremely lucky when this book placed on the bestseller list.
1,Too boring to finish,"The book started out interesting, and I did enjoy the descriptions of the renovations and the countryside. However, by the time I got to the middle of the book, I was bored! Maybe I should have kept reading, but there are too many other fabulous books out there."
1,The Tuscan Sun Shines Elsewhere,"Someone gave us this book--and that's the only good thing we can say about it. Apparently this type of book--overwritten, cloying, simplistic--easily fills the void in the American spirit. By reading it we become ""spiritual voyeurs"", content to witness anothers foreign achievements, however meager and poorly written they might be. Yes, we should have books written by authors residing in foreign climes--but not druidic, pseudo-poetic extrapolations like this! But the obvious success of Ms. Mayes' nonsense (with recipes!) has made her rich and that is what America exists for."
1,This is Italy?,"I slogged through this book hoping I could learn something about a part of Italy that I have only passed through. Instead I was subjected to the mid-life crisis of a pampered, spoiled woman for whom everything must be JUST SO. She doesn't experience Italy, she engineers ""experiences"" of ""Italy"". I rolled my eyes at her dismay in having to take her wedding guests to a downscale, unatmospheric, but tasty pizzeria when all the others were closed. Hey, if the pizza's good, who cares? One summer in Naples (my fave) and her fairy tale image of Italy would crumble like a rock slide on the Tange. (Might have to try her hazelnut gelato recipe, though...) Paolo Tullio's ""North of Naples, South of Rome"" isn't about Tuscany, but it's a more insightful and realistic introduction to rural Italy."
1,A Totally Dull Account of a House Renovation in Tuscany,"I began reading this book with much anticipation being a lover of Italy. But what a complete bore - pages and pages of description of clearing fields, shoring up walls, striping floors. It was a big yawn and an act of will just to finish the book. Something makes me suspect that it became a bestseller because of the similiarity of the author's name to that of Peter Mayle who writes those delightful books about Provence. Believe me Mayes is not in his class. If you want to read about the renovation of a house read Tracy Kidder's book,"" House"". It's vastly superior."
5,Mayes brings this charming little city to life in words!,"I began reading this book, about a month before I left to study abroad in Cortona. I had heard that it would give me an idea of the place. At first, it seemed to be another collection of thoughts in a journal not unlike my own. Then I decided to wait to arrive before reading it. Once there, I read and used it like a guide all over town, finding those perfect little stores, and seeing those strange little cortenese people. And by description alone, I found my way to her house, and it is as beautiful as the imagery she uses to describe it. Cortona is a beautiful and fragrant little culture trapped in time. Mayes brought that into the spotlight... and now, remembering my studies there, I have read it again, and each time, I smile remembering those beautiful places, swearing that I will get back there. I will. I'm sure my copies of her ""guides"" will be packed in my bags."
5,an engrossing and evocative portrait of Tuscany,"I cannot remember the last time I read such an incredibly absorbing and enjoyable book. Mayes' Tuscan Sun has turned me into a fan of travel writing for good! Her light, conversational tone and graceful pen bring forth the sights and sounds of Italy in a way I never could have imagined. A must-read for experienced globe-trotters and armchair travelers alike!"
2,Shallow and stiff -- a disappointment.,"Here is writing about Tuscany that exhibits all too many of the worst aspects of travel writing. The author maintains a superior, snooty, ""aren't I great"" tone throughout. The characters in her book fail to come to life -- often described simply by their nationality, e.g. ""the Poles"" or their occupation. If you are really interested in finding out about Italy, I suggest that you buy both of Tim Parks' books -- ""Italian Neighbors"" and ""Italian Education"". Parks has a sense of humor and and a novelist's deft touch of character and description. You'll have more fun and learn more from a chapter of Parks than with the whole of Mayes' book. Indeed, when her own powers fail her, Mayes quotes Parks!"
3,Great first half! I stopped reading after that :-(,"I was really enthralled with this book for the first half. The storyline was interesting, I was drawn in. But about the middle of the book it just changed. She suddenly started long descriptions of buildings and towns, and nothing much was going on anymore. I guess I was disappointed because it felt like the storyline just dropped off. I have tried to continue reading but I'm not sure I will.Also, this book is nothing like the movie. The only thing in common is the name, and the fact that there was a renovation. Everything is different. That was surprising as well. I did very much enjoy the movie, it's one of my favorites. But if you are looking for the story behind the movie (as I was) you won't find it here."
3,Under the Tuscan Sun book,"I loved the movie ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" and so I thought I would read the book around which the movie was based. I was disappointed. Other than the title and few minor characters, the movie and the book told two completely different stories. I still love the movie, but I'm sorry I wasted money on the book."
4,you'll want to move to Italy after reading this book,"I've been fascinated with Italy ever since a brief visit there three years ago. This book brings alive the culture and rhythm of Tuscan living. As the author describes the renovation of the house and grounds and settling into Italian life, you wonder to yourself why life can't be more like that everywhere. This book made me want to go buy a house in Italy too!"
2,Disappointing,"I hate to jump on the pile, but this was a disappointment following the movie. Expecting details regarding the characters and situations in the movie, it was a letdown to find the book was a dry and somewhat self-absorbed account of buying, restoring, and life in a villa in Tuscany. Without an interest in nest feathering, I wouldn't have gotten past the first chapter.The author could have found a very similar getaway only 50 or 60 miles north of her primary residence in San Francisco and saved herself a ton of money. Not as interesting a place to shop for cheese or to sip wine with expatriots, but much more convenient to ""real"" life."
2,"Rich, smug American gloats about her vacation home","This book was so hyped that I hoped it would be good, but the best that I can say is that it is fairly well-written. The writer is terrifically proud of herself. She drops references to her privileged childhood, successful (but part-time) career, and stunning San Francisco home as often as possible. As other reviewers have pointed out, she has an art-colony view of Italy, where she hangs out with other leisured expatriates and micromanages her environment."
1,...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....,...huh?...oh!...(yawn!)...was I sleeping...?...I thought I was reading...this book about...every single detail about a house.... maybe I just dreamed there was a book that boring.....
2,Not at all what I expected,"Although I never saw the film, I wrongly assumed (since there is a picture of Diane Lane on the cover) that the movie was adapted from the book, and therefore I was purchasing a romance novel. I am not even halfway through the book, and I have already read my fill of cheese, fresh vegetables and run down summer homes. Although Frances Mayes does a wonderful job describing Tuscany and all it entails, after 150 plus pages, I find it hard to concentrate.This is more a traveler's journal of Mayes' summers in Tuscany. If this is the type of book you are looking for, I am sure you will love it. If you are looking for romance, look elsewhere."
1,"A Massive Case of ""The Emperor's New Clothes""","Verbose, cliché-ridden, superficial, and materialistic, this book stars not Tuscany but Frances Mayes, who treats Italy like a gigantic mall. In her view, Italian architecture, food, wine, art, history, and even people exist only as products to decorate the author's personal Disneyland. The book's success can be explained only by marketing hype and critics' reluctance to speak the truth. Fellow readers, the emperor is naked. Save your money, and a tree. If you want to read about Italian food, go to the real authorities: Marcella Hazan or Mayes's own source, Elizabeth David."
2,Lemon Tree,"The cover of mine was decorated with the actress from the movie so I expected it to be the tragic romance with a happy ending on the DVD. Instead I got a description of a couple of college proffessors who cash in their investments to buy a million dollar run down house in Cortona Italy in which they only planned to live in 3 months out of the year.It doesn't tell a story so much as it describes one, like an outline with too much external detail. It has no dialouge whatsoever so it's very one dimensional. The only thing I got out of it was a strong desire to go buy a lemon tree and see the landscapes of Italy."
4,Loves the Hanes her way,Always buy Hanes her way underwear it fits well it's cute and it's very comfortable. I will always recommend Hanes her way I got the hightops because they feel the best
4,allow for fabric to shrink order a size up,These are well made but they do shrink. I washed them in hot water and they did shrank a size. If you account for that you will like these.
5,Purchase for my daughter.,She loves it. Comfortable fit. True to size. Good for the winter. Maximum coverage. Will purchase again in the future.
3,"Great Product, but beware","I bought this from Amazon itself, no third party retailers on Amazon. The filter works very well, and I am very happy with it. Interestingly, it is made in Israel. It is fairly tedious to install, but it does come with very helpful instructions. Installation requires the removal of the glove compartment, and the interior panels below the glove compartment, it took me a little over an hour. It came in a huge box, with another Air filter I ordered, and they were dancing around in the box during shipping, so the box was damaged, and a few of the pleats in the filter were bent pretty badly. It took quite an effort to straighten out the pleats, but it's working beautifully now."
4,This book should be read by all adolescents.,"I read this book for an education class in college. I found that it was easy to read since it is composed of a myriad of small stories. I could relate well with the stories since I am twenty years old. It made me understand what many girls have to go through; I had many friends and acquaintences that I could place into the stories. However, several stories had no endings; as a reader, I prefer closure."
1,Check the facts for yourself . . .,"Ask yourself a question: how many of the claims by Mary Pipher have been supported by peer reviewed research? Check her bibliography. How many books does she cite that rely on peer reviewed research? Take any of her factual claims and check them out for yourself. How many hold up? The truth is that this is feminist agit-prop that fits the ""women's studies"" department mandate to try to find a reason for existing. Tell a group of people raised on self-esteem and Oprah that they should be even more in love with themselves. . . and they will respond with adulation. Or try this: teach a class to eighteen year old people and explain that their problems were caused by some conspiracy to put them down. . . and check out how many of them can ""relate!"""
5,ophelia - an eye opener,"This book is both startling and hopeful in its portrayal of young adolescent women and the trials they face in today's world. I have recommended it to my friends and family who have daughters ten and older. The stories are heart-wrenching, frightening, but also promising. Some of the young women whose cases are presented face terrible obstacles, yet they not only survive adolescence, they thrive. The author gives us a shockingly honest glimpse into the physical, mental and spiritual lives of our daughters growing up in a world that worships physical beauty. It shows us the inner sense of betrayal and anger that girls feel when pressured to look and behave contrary to their true selves and how this anger is often manifested in dangerous choices and the rejection of their loved ones at a time when they most need their protection."
5,"An amazing, true to life, and exquisitely written book.","The stories she tells are compelling and it was a joy to read. As a teenage girl, it was wondeful to see that someone has hope for us. She wasn't judgmental, she knows that we live in a different age. That most people do struggle in their teenage years and that you can overcome it. It is really an important book for all to read."
4,I thought this book was very interesting and insightful.,"This book gave me a new look at raising my daughter. She is only two and I had it set in my mind how I am going to raise her. The things that I have in mind are mentioned in the book and made me feel good about the decisions that I have made about my choices for parenting. I would recommend this book for any single, new mothers that are out there raising or going to raise daughters."
5,I like this book because it dealt with real girls' lives.,"The problems of each girl were different and dealt with differently, but in many cases they are not alone. Girls everywhere deal with these kinds of problems. This book lets each girl read situations other girls have faced, how they felt, and what they did about it. I really found it to be interesting because I did not know some of the things that go on. I came from a family that did not have any problems but the simple arguments."
4,Good book for the young and confused.,"The book was a great look at how teenage girls have so much trouble in all aspects of their lives. They could learn alot from reading this. They would find out that they are not alone in thier struggles and get support from the author's comments. Unforntunately for parents, most of the problems girls have can happen to their daughters. Parents could learn from this book."
5,"An antidote to the ""girl poison"" in our popular culture.","...Dr. Pipher has hit it right on the mark with her observation of our popular culture as being ""look-obsessed, media-saturated, 'girl-poisoning' culture.""Reviving Ophelia is call to arms for parents, teachers, and anyone with a stake in the lives of our adolescent girls to go on the offensive and take them back from the jaws of death. This book offers a compassionate look as to why so many of our children have eating disorders, suffer depression and from a low sense of self, and are killing themselves in alarming numbers.I encourage anyone with a daughter to read this book in order to innoculate her against the ""girl-poison"" that has saturated our popular culture. I would give this book 10 stars if I could."
1,Over exaggerated feminst account of the life of adolescents,"Mary Pipher bases her view of female adolescents on a small sampling of troubled girls. She extrapolates their experiences to a global scale blaming our male dominated society for all their troubles. She of course has no data to back up her extrapolation. Nor does she verify the accuracy of the stories these troubled, attention starved girls feed her. Pipher lives and practices in a rural community, yet her adolescent patients have all seemingly been the victims of rapes, insect, violence, etc. on an abundant scale. They are coddled and fondled in their schools walking to class, etc.Pipher clearly has a feminist political message to deliver throughout the book. Yet, she is clearly not a philosophical giant by any means. So, if you're buying it looking for some helpful advice on raising a child, don't waste your money. If you're looking for the ramblings of a bitter feminist, this is the book for you."
1,We are not helpless saplings,"This book in not an eyeopener. Pipher is simply stating the obvious, over and over again. It does not take a Ph.D to realize that society harms girls like myself. She also portray us to be helpless victims floundering in a misogynistic (a word she throw around too freely) culture. As a psychologist, doesn't she realize that depression cannot be blamed on the world? It is a chemical imbalance of the brain, proven to be severely intensified by changing hormones. She generalizes, stereotypes (the rich girl, the poor girl, the anorexic girl, the smart girl), and does not seem to see her clients as individuals.As a teenage girl, I was not impressed. I am not a sapling in the wind, I am something far more resilient and righteous. If you want to read about the way adolescent girls feel and are, why don't you ask one, instead of hearing a story filtered through the mouth of someone intent of saving ""saplings."""
3,This was an interesting book but very repititous.,"I read this book for my education 2000 class. At first I was very excited about reading the book. Once I started, it was interesting but began to sound repetitive. I continued reading thinking that this is just the beginning and it will get better. Well, it was still just as repetitive throughout the entire book. It was a good book and should be read by any person who wishes to learn more about why someone acts the way the do. It gives very good feedback and was interesting but it also made it a little hard to get through the book."
4,Still a Neccesary Read,"This is the book that parents and girls need to read and discuss.I read this as a girl myself, and it allowed me to see my behavior in new, helpful light.Now I am a mom myself, and one of my children is a girl, so I read it again- and still, it speaks to me in a profound way. I hope it makes me a better mom in the same way that it made me a better adolescent.However, it does need to be updated, not just because the case studies now seem dated, but also because Pipher unflinchingly discusses the problems with schools. Since homeschooling has grown a good deal in the years since this book's initial publication, I think it is a neccesary componenent to explore, perhaps even as a partial solution for many of the problems outlined in this book."
3,Interesting but flawed,"The book's flaw is that the author tries to convince the reader of generalities by offering unconnected anecdotes. What's more, her position as a psychotherapist taints her perspective. It is somewhat analogous to a fireman claiming that all cats are stuck in trees. Despite the flaws in methodology it does offer some interesting and thought provoking points."
3,Enlightened Mom,I found the book to be very informative and gave me insight into what young girls go through now.
5,Horrifyingly Revealing,"Pipher captures the adolescence our girls experience but can not verbalize. ""Reviving Ophelia"" should be read by every woman at least three times in their lives...once when entering adolescence, once when experiencing adolescence and once when completing adolescence. It is also a must read for all mothers and fathers with girls of any age-for though it is alarming and shocking, it provides solutions and hope for the lives we can provide for our young women."
4,Very Good.,"A very thought-provoking book. It is true that the various examples are quite 'non-mainstream' in many cases but every one of them harbors its own personal truth. Although the author does not offer a real conclusion to the issues raised it may be that she realizes the problems are too complex to be adressed in a few paragraphs.The given examples are NOT meant to be a portrait of the average teenage female so no one has to be offended about that. If the problems do not apply to you that's great (I myself lead a very problem-free life) but they probably do to someone else, maybe someone we have been closing our eyes to. And if we really DON'T know anyone who fits the descriptions there is absolutely no guarantee we won't run into one of them in the future, so we might as well think about how we may be able to understand them."
2,a review,"I do not use this item anymore because the ear piece sound is not loud enough for me to hear from it. So, my cell phone is to the volume that I need but does not transmit through the headset and therefore not useful to me."
1,Not a well-written book!,"This book has a big, fancy, attractive title. But inside it does not have detailed explaination. It is not comprehensive as it claims. It is not a well-written book. It's more like a collection of conference papers thrown together for quick publication."
1,Non-fiction accounts are far more compelling,"The only good thing that I have to say about this book is that it led me to re-examine the non-fiction accounts of the characters involved in the assassination conspiracy. The factual material is far more interesting than anything Mr. Robertson twisted around to fit into his ""novel."" John Surratt's true story as a confederate courier (not photographic assistant to Mr. Gardner as this story has it) would make for a far more compelling story. I found it disturbing that for the story's sake, Mr. Robertson had a sexual affair go on between Booth and Mrs. Surratt. The true story of Mrs. Surratt's probable innocence would itself be worthwhile reading. I could go on with examples (but I won't). Don't waste your time or money on this book. If you are interested in John Wilkes Booth and the story of the assassination conspiracy, there are tons of fascinating non-fiction books out there on the subject."
2,Could Have been Great,"As a long time BB card collector, my parents stumbled onto a bobbing head, an item I didn't have. Needless to say I have gotten hooked, with my collection now over twenty dolls. I read the large print on the cover, and thought it would be just what I needed, but the book is really about dolls from 1960-1972. The author simply blows off the newer versions as being too manufactured and barely covers them. A better detail history of the newer dolls and more aggressive price guide would have made this book a 5star."
2,Different From The Live Show,"I recently saw Russell Simins live and it was absolutely amazing, so the next day I went out and bought the CD. I was greatly disappointed; the studio recordings didn't seem to have half the soul that they did live. I still like the CD (because it reminds me of how good it really was), but if you want to buy the Album just because of their live performances, maybe you should think twice."
4,Funny...but oh so true!,"This ""novel"" written as nothing but emails to and from the characters, is a very funny capturing of life in the ad business. Though taking place in London, it is a 2000 version of ""Mad Men."" Very funny, and it captures the characters oh so very well."
4,great fluff!,"I read this book in one evening. It made me laugh, which is about the highest praise i can give any book. So when you're in the mood for something that is very entertaining to lift your mood, i highly recomment this book."
5,A Must Read For Anyone In Advertising,"Don't write this one off as being just another novelty book. Aside from the clever format, there's also a great story. And great characters. Characters that anyone in the ad industry will recognize. By just reading other people's inner office emails, you discover so much about everyone. I found it very hard to put down."
4,Sadly (and hilariously) true,"I've worked at an ad agency for 12 years (for a few of them, actualy). It's amazing how we fall into stereotypes. This book is amoung other things (like funny and clever) very true. Anyone aspiring to get into this business should read it. Anyone already in it, has to."
3,eeeeeasy,"If you're in an airport, need something lite, entertaining and with a trace of plot, pick this one up. Keywords: microsoft outlook, how to put your book together and get a job in advertising, the dozens (brit style)."
4,Informative,Machine Quilting Made Easy is a very helpful book for new quilters. It describes every detail completely and takes the fear out of starting that first quilting project. No one wants to foul up something they have spent hours piecing. This book puts you at ease to start practicing and then jump right in with confidence.
2,just ok,i wasn't that impressed with this book..i am a person who loves color and pictures and this book was shy on both
2,Useful book for narrow-minded high school students,"As an educated adult, I found this book to be useless to me, and almost an insult to my intelligence. It is meant to be a textbook for young people who have never before had an original thought. The book may be about ""thinking,"" but if you're looking for ""art,"" go elsewhere."
4,Good.,"It was a used book I didn't expect much. Everything matched the description as stated, except for minor water damage throughout the book."
2,Whatttt,The book was not in the advertised shape. And also a ton of pages were written on and highlighted. Not what I expected with my first purchase off of amazon.
1,"Too noisy, constantly turns on and off","I bought this heater a few years ago, used it for one winter, and now it's collecting dust in the garage. The unit is NOISY... and the fact that the thermostat makes it constantly shut on and off makes the noise all the more noticeable. Forget using this in the bedroom if you're a light sleeper. I received a Holmes radiator-type heater as a gift and have been using that ever since."
2,Didn't last long,"Great while it was working, but it didn't last long. Lasted about a year. Now automatically shuts off within minutes of tuning it on - rather useless now."
2,Thermostat a real problem,"The concept of this heater looked great, but it has one fatal flaw--the thermostat. It seems to think the room is much hotter than it actually is. As a result, even at the highest setting it shuts off after a short period of time. Yet the room is still cold--and there's no way to turn the heater back on. You basically have to wait 20 minutes for the heater to ""cool down"" enough to work again. We basically don't use it, and we went out and bought another."
1,Loud fan and terrible thermostat,"I bought this from Target a week ago for $30 based on a review in Consumer Reports. I returned it to Target this morning. I do not recommend this unit. Here are the Pros and Cons:Pros:* Small* InexpensiveCons:* Must keep it 3 feet away from everything since it blows hot air in 360 degrees.* The unit is loud: it kept my 1 year old daughter awake when we had it in her room.* The thermostat has no hysteresis. Translated to English: the unit comes on for 15 seconds, then shuts itself off as soon as the temperature in the immediate area goes up by a degree. Then, after about a minute or two, it comes on again as the temperature drops slightly. So basically the unit keeps cycling on and off all night.Bottom line: if you want it for a garage, it's probably ok, but for a bedroom, get something else."
5,Excellent!,"When my husband and I moved into our new home in May06, we found in the basement back room two of these heaters. We contacted the pervious owners and told them they had left the heaters, they had left them for us and told us these are good heaters and where we should place them in the house to help keep the bill down. When the weather begin to cool down we used these heaters, the house was warm. So we order three more and they help us to keep our heating bill down. They work very well and it does not take long for the area to heat up. During the day when we are home we turn on all the ones in the house and it is amazing how well they heat the house up, the cord does not get hot and they have a shut off componet, it is just a great product. I would reccommend this product to anyone who is shopping for heaters. I give it 5 stars! and label it Excellent!"
4,Honeywell HZ-2200 Mini Tower Surround Heater,"I bought this little heater because my dorm room was way too cold or way too warm. During the cold weather the heater did wonders and my dorm room is a decent sized room not a really small one. Also since the weather is becoming really nice the fan is doing a really great job as well! I definitely recommend this heater. It is a bit loud though, but once you get used to it, it's really not a big deal at all. I'd rather have some background noise than be freezing. All in all the heater provides a good source of heat."
4,Works for us!,"We purchased 4 of these Honeywell Mini Towers for various rooms in our cabin that are not used regularly. With propane for our main fuel, this should cut down on the expense, and we'll just turn on one of these when we use the room, and not heat it all the time."
2,only good for a very small space and takes time to heat,"I got this for my bathroom for getting out of the shower in the wintertime. The fan speed is very low. Even the high speed barely blows air that much. It will warm a small bathroom, but will take some time getting there. Not nearly as powerful as I'd hoped."
4,Great for knocking the chill off!,"This is a great heater, it will heat up any normal size room. It also comes with Temp control that is real nice. The noise level is about average. But it's well worth it for the money."
4,Memories,"I remember this holdiay special when I was very young. It was only recently that I decided to find it on any format.. preferring DVD. I have very little memory of the show, but remember how amazing it was to see the big stars on my TV screen. A memory I would like to cherish and relive."
3,Why the heck did you make this movie,This movie is dumb. It is a dumb idea. If I was asked to be in it I would of said no. Well actually I would say yes but you get my point. I don't get where it is supposed to be in the saga. If its supposed to be after 6 that would make no sense because Darth Vader is dead.It was just kind of a dumb idea. But I guess the movie is okay.
3,"Recording is for fun, not very","I am a Bostonian who heard the recording from one of my English students. Dressed to the teeth is an expression I readily recognize, but I am more likely to read it than to hear it in everyday, modern conversation. Some of the expressions are probably regional, perhaps most from Northeastern section of the country. Of course the term American is often misused, and foreign visitors should be careful buying books claiming to teach American words or phrases."
4,Technical...yet understandable,"The authors did a wonderful job of compiling years of scientific research into a natural history book. This is definately a book for the more scientifically-oriented community. It is nice to see the technical aspects included, rather than oversimplifying the material into a ""storybook."" The missing star is for the price...but this is probably a matter related to the publisher rather than the authors."
2,Must we whine?,"I must say I am truly disgusted with this book. The author tells her story in a whining fashion. Poor me, I've struggled with an eating disorder. She's been in the hospital and mentions she is in danger of cardiac arrest but she doesn't wear a MA bracelet. She is only 23 and really doesn't know the struggles of life b/c she hasn't lived one. She wants to come across as strong but she's not."
4,Stripped bare...,"Yikes. At her lowest point, Marya weighed somewhere around 50 pounds. She announced, at age 4, that she was on a diet, and started making herself throw up at age nine. Eating disorders were a normal way of life for her, and this book is a peek inside the head of someone who has major, MAJOR issues with food.It's not so much the story of her life, but the description of why her life was/is the way it was/is. Sometimes she rambles on and on about her parents and I'd slap her if she wouldn't immediately break. The part of the book before her final breakdown was just amazing to me to read. I don't understand how someone who weighs 54 pounds can walk around and even have any sort of semblance of being alive.She's not necessarily cured, she says, there's no big happy ending to the book. Every day is a struggle for her. Sad, sad book."
4,Heart-stopping Writing,"At the age of 23, Hornbacher wrote what life-long writers have trouble saying. She portrays her life-threatening eating disorder (which at one point whittled her away to 52 lbs) in an informal, unapologetic, and almost detached way. The lack of attachment or emotional investment might make the book seem more disturbing, which I thought was an asset given the subject. Hornbacher also aims to educate us, the outsiders, about what someone with an eating disorder is really thinking and I found that to be a very satisfying thread throughout the book. I wanted to hear an honest-but-educated account of anorexia and bulimia, and this was it. I highly recommend this to anyone with an interest in eating disorders, and especially to parents of adolescent girls."
4,this book will affect you,"I picked up this book in a store while browsing and after reading the first chapter I couldn't put it down. So many women - including those in my family, have huge issues with food, though not everyone takes it to the extreme of this author. After recently losing a lot of weight, in a healthy way, myself, I am happy though can now recognize that losing weight will not in itself make you a more popular, happy, successful etc.etc. person. Reading this book drove this point home too. I have passed it on to other friends who have 'food issues' and the general concensus is 'harrowing but fascinating'. The author goes into a lot of detail about her feelings, and even though she is a survivor, she doesn't dwell too much on her current life, which is a shame, because it would be nice to see her happy."
1,Dangerous,Yes Hornbacher can write but this book was disturbing for me. It was as though she was trying to tell people how to be better at their ED.
5,encaptures eating disorders to a tee.,"I see this book as a completion, a that's it-I'm not putting up with you any more, Finito!, of my very own trip with Anorexia and Bulimia Nervosa. To this day it has been a total of six-years that I have been up against these two disorders. I was ""lucky"" enough to experience a Tramatic Brain Injury in March '98, and forgot a lot of my sexual abuse. Yet it, the pain & fright, is becoming very present in my life now. As I read this book, I found it to nurture the insanity in, what I say is; me. Mayra has handed over to me Power to remember and kill off this inabiling disabilty. It's Complete, now. Also note, I am 22-years-old(not 12)."
1,Tricks of the trade: How to become Anorexic,"I rushed to buy this book when it came out in hardcover, I devoured it in three days. But as I was reading it I kept having diminishing thoughts about myself. This book gives intimate details of how and what an anorexic does to become thin. I was once an anorexic myself and yes, you never completly recover. When writing a published book that goes out to millions you need to focus on what needs to be done to fix the problem called low self esteem in young women. I also have wrote a memoir of sort where I rely all my doings when I was anorexic but I would never share this with anyone. Because I would not want to be the inspiration for another girl to go through the torture that I went through. I think this author did this more for publicity and personal gratification than trying to help others become aware of what things need to be done to prevent deathly mental illness."
5,amazing,"there isn't much for me to say-- marya's book is beautiful and brutal. i cry every time i read it and see myself so many times in her words. she shows eating disorders for what they are: diseases, addictions, and never-ending dances with your own self-hatred."
3,"Average Book, courageous girl","This book was good, not captivating. It got boring and at times repetitive. Marya was very honest and revealing, however, sometimes it seemed she just wanted to sound intelligent instead of getting to the story. Just wasn't my style of writing I guess"
3,Can Do Without...,"A nice frank and direct, sometimes touching story, for those of us who are looking to identify with someone with similar disorder, i.e. Anorexia. I found no real insights or deep understandings as for what triggered the disorder or helped her to unleash from it. Nice reading, although not a must."
4,Well written and very revealing!,"As a current sufferer of bulimia, I understand exactly what the author was trying to convey. this book is a must read for anyone who is or knows anyone suffering from an eating disorder."
5,Amazing.,"This really was a good book. I had been searching many books on this topic and mainly relied on reader`s reviews + feedback to make a choice. It was a little different than I thought but, nevertheless, I was completely immersed in the book shortly after I began reading it. You can see and feel everything she talks about... very well and honestly written. Great great great."
1,Disappointing sales hype disguised as a book,"This book refers to the need to buy from the authors' web site no less than 26 times in the book! It is ridiculous, the book is actually an advertisement to try and lure people in to buy the authors' overpriced chat room and other services.I tried to look for some redeeming features in the book, and could find none. Buy Toni Turner' book or Coopers' ""Hit and Run Trading"" etc., but stay away from this sales pitch book."
1,Another Wade Cook?,"---------------------------------- QUOTE FROM THE BOOK: ----------------------------------""A very wise man once told me if I ever wanted something really bad, all I had to do was give it away.......... Whatever level of knowledge you have, teach it. Give it away. Shout it from the highest rooftop in your neighborhood. Then watch what happens. I have only one question for you should you decide to take me up on this: :Are you ready to fly?""Curious how both Wade Cook and Mr. Velez both preach this but never actually practice it themselves. (How much for his seminars?).It doesn't get more hypocritical, patronizing and cheesey than this.I got a good laugh out of this book but as a full time trader with 30 years experience, I returned this book to the person who asked me to review it with the advice:""Save your money - He's selling and this is just a large brochure""."
3,My Review,"The first half is entertaining. But, the real stuff comes at the half of the book. I would have liked it better if it came with more tools and discussions of various strategies.Ignore the references to Pristine.com. Take what you can get from this book and use your own judgement. I don't agree with everything these guys have to say, so be cautious with applying their technics.If you want to save some money buy Toni Turner's book, ""A Beginner's Guide to Daytrading Online."" It even has more tactics for a 1/3 of the price of Velez & Capra's book."
2,Nothing new,"nothing new, nothing exciting. Everything can be found in books that are half the price. Save your money."
3,Poor Binding,Within a week of receiving this book. The pages all started falling out. The binding is poorly made.
1,MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT - STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE,"I have been trading and investing for 10 years, have read many books on the subject and always seem to learn something new and meaningful. This book is the exception. It was a complete waste of time and money. How anyone could give this book 5 stars is beyond comprehension. It must be friends of the authors because this book offers traders and investors nothing. The only thing you will get from this book is wiped out."
3,Rudimentary intro to trading,"I would recommend this book to beginners, as an intro it is better than most of the junk out there.There is nothing new in this book for experienced, well read traders though, nor anything advanced. The word ""master"" in the title is misleading, which is why I am giving it only 3 stars.For advanced traders I recommendReading Price Charts Bar by Bar: The Technical Analysis of Price Action for the Serious Trader (Wiley Trading)instead."
5,Great tasting but Hot!!!,"This salsa is the best tasting salsa I have ever had, however, the heat this salsa brings to your mouth is so intense that I recommend this to only someone who can really take fire. Don't let it touch your lips, you will regret it."
2,Same events could be summarized in 100 pages,"I can't believe I actually finished this book. It was very repetitive and rather boring, although I would say the last ~50 pages were the most suspenseful. Maybe that's because I knew I was finally at the end of the book and I was excited to get it over with. I kept waiting for it to get better; never did. Plus the overuse of italicized words drove me nuts."
3,Worth reading for the Bourne conclusion,"This is the third and final book in the Bourne series. The first book (Identity) is fairly good. The second book (Supremacy) isn't very good and doesn't add anything to the series. This third book could be fully enjoyed without reading the second book.This third book isn't as good as the first one. But, it is worth reading if you want to follow through on the conclusion from the first book. The biggest problem with this series is that the emotional musings of the hero about his identity and the love and worry about his wife get pretty tedious in the first book, are beat to death in the second book and are just painful to read by the third book. Maybe this third book could be better enjoyed by skipping the first two books (althought there are major parts of the first book that are better than anything in the third book)."
1,Worst of the three,"This book is seriously flawed. Utterly implausible plot, unconvincing dialogue, seriously stupid characters. The writing was so tedious I had to skip entire pages of drivel just to get through it. The book was so badly written, I threw the book down several times from sheer frustration. I forced myself to finish the book, but never again. Ludlum is on my ""Avoid"" list."
4,Another good one in the series ...,"I'm not a literary critic so I'm not going to deeply analyze the plot or compare Lustbader to Ludlum. However, having read ALL of the Bourne series from the original 3 written by Ludlum to the additional 5 I think it is now by Lustbader it is all good fun. If you like the Bourne character, the genre, and the general storyline then you will like all of them. I read for entertainment and for something to help me escape reality when I am frequently stuck in ""cattle class"" on a US air carrier, on a plane that is loaded to the gills, surrounded by screaming kids, and a beer will cost me $6. Cracking good read all, great for escaping air travel hell or enjoying a day at the beach."
2,"How does this person fit into this story, again?","This was the first time I've read any books in this series and the first in this genre. I have inadvertently picked up a second, third or even fourth book in a series and can't wait to get my hands on the others. Not the case here. I continued reading because my cousin gave it to me and we have the same reading preferences. I was also convinced that it would get better in the next chapter. It never did and it took me over a month to get through it when it should have only taken a few nights at most. There were some good and likeable characters in the story, though. But, at the same time, there were too many characters that didn't move the story along. I am giving this book two stars only because I managed to get through it but it is quite forgettable."
4,A Delight to Read,This book was chosen for my monthly reading group and I was amazed on how I enjoyed this book so much. I found the characters very entertaining and the story held my interest. Plus the recipes sounded so good it was hard to stay on my diet. I intend to read the whole series and I would recommend this book highly.
2,"Good, but not her best!","I have read nearly all of Davidson's books and found this to be the least captivating of them all. The plot and characters are intriguing, but get lost in several subplots that seem woefully underdeveloped."
4,Post Jones Stones,A good DVD for Rolling Stones fans. Good interview footage after the death of Brian Jones. Could be a few more songs in the concert footage section that we haven't seen/heard. Most of it has been released before.
4,Wonderful CD!,I am always struck with awe everytime I listen to Rick Simerly. His mastery of chord progressions/changes and technique has my mouth covered with drool whenever I listen to his cd. He is highly underrated and is certainly one of the best in the wolrd!John J. Jenkins
4,Val McDermid - please write more like this!,"This was a brilliant book that had me gripped right from beginning to end, the characters Kit, Fiona and Steve were really convincing - my only complaint being that the profiler Fiona was ALWAYS right. I'd like to read more books with this characters in - here's hoping."
5,Wonderful Resource!,"This book is very informative, and a must have if you want to work with your dog without paying a professional trainer. The picture illustrations are a perfect compliment to the written instructions. I especially liked the detail given about other obedience issues such as dog language and how aggression begins between dogs. This book is a permanent addition to our living room reading material!"
1,Among the worst metal albums of the 90's,"Stratovarius hails from my homecountry Finland, and it's a really huge name back here (last two albums have gone gold). I don't really like power metal, but when ""Visions"" was released - I was 15- it really managed to capture my attention. But when I heard some of this album I realised how boring they can be. Plagiating Yngwie Malmsteen (who isn't the mr Genius himeslf, eiter) doesn't make a classic album. I'm sorry to say this, but this- among Helloween, Hammerfall and Gamma Ray - proves just how much I dislike this genre. PS: You can't fight to dragons with a sword only."
5,Fourth Dimension rocks,"Although Visions and Father Time are more ""catchy,"" I would say that 4D is definitely their best album. It sounds the most progressive; the music is the most interesting; and, with all apologies to Jorg Michael, the drumming on this album is more appealing and less repetitive. ""Twilight Symphony,"" the second to last song, is an absolute masterpiece."
1,I REGRET,"Everyday I regret the day I bought this album. I had been hearing for so long about Stratovarius that I decided to go for a look. What a shock. THis is the worst kind of classic metal that can be done. It's cheesy, pop, no energy. It reminds me of Malmsteen latter albuns ( commercial and heartless ). Of course there is quality in the musicians, but they just doesn't know what ""rock"" means. I think I'm gonna sell it."
1,False melodic-metal,"Melodic metal is one thing I like. See Helloween (the Keeper albuns), Gamma Ray, and Stratovarius themselves. But on this CD, Stratovarius is too cheesy, the guitar is too ""clean"", the voice performing is trying to be so ""perfect"" that lost all characteristics of real rock / metal. It's disturbing for the listener, and it's boring, very boring."
5,Excellent book!,The author explains in minute detail how to go about her technique. I am just finishing a landscape quilt I started upon finishing the cover-to-cover reading of her book. A must-have in any quilter's library.
3,"It is easy, which makes it great for my 3 & 5 year old boys","I bought this game because my 3 & 5 year old sons loved the movie and so many people went on about how easy it is.Both my 3 & 5 years can play. My 5 year old has gotten pretty far through the game on his own, while my 3 year old can get through the first few levels, but tends to get stuck after that.I can see where a child a few years older might finish the game in a few days (or even a a few hours). But for my little ones it is an nice fit.The game is an okay platformer in 1 player mode.The game has a mode to share the game between 2 DS consoles. This mode is terrible. It is simply one screen where Marty and Alex jump around killing foosa.There are no mini games or other features, just the main single player mode and the multi-DS mode."
3,Very hard game,"It is quite fun but you kind of have to really press the buttons and once you finish the game, you can try to unlock mini games. I like this because you can still have fun after you finished the game. I don't like that there are only 12 levels and that you get stuck a lot."
2,"P225FB - 4 22"" CRT monitor","I ordered the -4 model, but got the -5 model, which I heard had problems and it did. The screen gets blurry toward the edges, makes an onouxious noise when turned out and then screen shakes frequently. Did not like it. Amazon service was great though."
5,Great fun game!,"My child enjoyed this game, and loved the movie, it is a challenge and great fun with alot of animation!"
3,Sits too low,"I actually regret buying this for my minivan, because it's all but useless. The thing sits so low off the ground that I need a draw bar with about 6"" of rise to pull even a light trailer at a somewhat level stance. The product itself, like all other curt products I've purchased was excellent quality. I rate it low like this because I think that they should have refrained from manufacturing a hitch receiver that would sit so low, or that they should at least have put a disclaimer in the notes for my vehicle application to that effect."
5,loved it,Loved this when it was on tv and the the cd is great. Lived in D.C. as child so it brings back memories. Loved the romance.
3,GREAT Show!! Sound not so great though.,I grew up watching this show and absolutely love it. I was extremely excited to finally be able to get it on DVD. The only bad part is that the older shows do not have the same quality of sound as the new shows do. The sound is extremely low but the music is loud. Wish they would revamp the sound so it is better but it is still an awesome product.
5,Scarecrow & Mrs. King on DVD at last!,"Received the first season as a mother's day gift and have been pleased so far with the video/audio quality of the episodes we've watched. Loved this show as a kid (really, I was 12!) and am looking forward to the other seasons being released as well. It's as good as I remembered! Wish they hadn't kept us waiting all these years to get it onto DVD."
5,pu it on DVD,"Scarecrow and Mrs.King should be released on DVD. This show had so much to offer in his time. It is better than some of the other shows that have come out. It has a little romance with mystery which makes it a fun show,to watch with the family. I hope to see it out soon."
5,Love Lee and Amanda!,"This was a great series. It is wonderful that it can now be ours, with very clear video and audio quality. I eagerly await the next 3 seasons!"
5,who's holding this up?!!,"I have been waiting for so long for Scarecrow And Mrs.King to come out on DVD. I have watched this series with my Mom on her homemade VHS tapes which are very poor Quality. I love the show and would like to buy my Mom the whole series on DVD,which she has also been waiting for. WHATS THE HOLD UP?!!! Why hasn't this incredibly fun show been released yet?! What can we die hard fans do to get this DVD out ?!!!! Who's holding this up and Why?!! They've already got alot of incredibly lame T.V. shows out on DVD, Now lets get a good one out - Scarecrow and Mrs. King !"
4,When Will It Come Out On DVD?,Was a BIG FAN when the show was on in the mid 80's! I have recently renewed my interest by viewing limited episodes on another website. I was a Fan of Kate Jackson. It would be nice to relive this Fine Series from beginning to end & since the Stars of the show (with the exception of Beverly Garland who passed away recently) are still alive to give their take of the Series through the EXTRAS that would be INCLUDED in the SET of THE COMPLETE SERIES! So Please Release On DVD For Us Fans To Enjoy!
5,Scarecrow and Mrs. King: The Complete First Season,"I loved this TV series when it was on TV. When I found out that it was available on DVD I jumped to own it. It's a fun and ""wholesome"" series."
2,Controller Sometimes Works,"The controller is overall ok, but it works fine on some games, but it messes up on other games."
1,Practical experience with book.,"My channeling class had an extremely unsettling experience following the guidelines in this book. I recommend that this material be used with extreme caution. Who are the ""Angels of Karma""? Are they who they claim to be?"
3,pretty good,i though this book was good. it shows all the information about what osama has done. it was very evil what he has done. i recomend this book to people so they know about famous people even if they are evil. it shows u what is going on in the future. i was intrested and u should be to.thanks(...)
3,Pretty good game,This review is from my 9 year old daughter...She loves Pokemon. She likes Digimon. This is her first Digimon game. She really likes it overall though she maybe having some trouble figuring out some things in the game but I guess that comes with trial and error. She would reccommend this game.
5,pigat rockabilly dvd,"pretty good production. i liked it enough to pick up the travis picking dvd. i haven't practiced with it much yet, but it seems better taught than the brian setzer hotlicks tutorial from the 80's"
3,She is not Rachel Gibson....,"This was my second attempt to read an Amazon recommended author from the genre of book I enjoy reading. She just doesn't leave me with the same warm fuzzy feelings that Rachel Gibson's stories have. She writes better than the other schlock out there so give it a bash. You might enjoy her but for me, I won't buy her books again in a hurry."
5,I just can't get enough!,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet! I absolutely love this series and this was another five star read for me.At the beginning of the book we are introduced to Annabelle and she is trying to land a big client to the matchmaking business she has inherited from her grandmother. This is when we meet Heath Champion a top sports agent looking to meet his perfect trophy wife.As can be expected from a typical SEP novel things don't go as planned. As Annabelle is introducing Heath to her many top level matches something happens between them. Including a sexy scene at Kevin Tucker's summer cottage resort.I don;t know what it is about this series but every book has a crazy plot line that just... WORKS! I couldn't put it down, I couldn't get enough!As always not only do we get an amazing primary romance the secondary romance was amazing as well! I can;t believe I only have one book left in the series. Whatever will I do?"
5,GREAT ESCAPE!,I read this book in two days - it is great. Susan Elizabeth Phillips excells with the dialogues and the characters are great! I thoroughly enjoyed the story and was sorry when I finished the book. It made me laugh and happy. Can't wait for her next book.
1,Doesn't Work,"I purchased this polish today after seeing several on the shelf and came home expecting to be blinded by silver light. I rubbed I poured I rubbed some more. I let it sit for the minute as recommended, rinsed and only slightly better. I thought maybe it was that vase I was working on so I tried another. Same thing. This product is O U T of my kitchen, There are better out there with better and QUICKER results."
5,The ONLY polish you will ever need!,I have tried every brand and type of polish under the sun and this is by far the best. It removes the tarnish and leaves every piece feeling so smooth and looking very shiny. I wouldn't bother with any other polish or cleaner....this is the real deal and you won't be disappointed.
5,Nice Bike,"Had this bike for over a month. It's really nice and makes a 20 mile bike ride seem easy! I haven't pushed the battery over 20 miles yet so not sure how far it will go.You still have to peddle, but it's almost like you're peddling downhill or on a flat surface.Max speed with the battery assist is 15-18 mph. Anything after that is all via leg power.Bike is nice but only has 7 gears. It would be nice to have more gears for the downhills.Charger is nice and just plugs into a standard 110 outlet.I'll update in a few months but so far A+/b Update a year later: Bike is still going strong. A+. /b"
3,Not as easy as it should be,"i purchased this product and went to install the 3 disks, all went well until i got almost thru the 3rd disk, then i got an ""error 1402, could not open key"". it then uninstalled itself...i tried again and got the same thing. before i packed it up and sent it back i went to Delormes web site to their support section, and found what to do for an error 1402 or 1406, i was able to do it and installed it. if you are not comfortable working with your computer then don't get this product and try to install it. but if you do step by step what your are instructed by Delorme it will work. good luck."
5,"Visualization of time, space, networks and beyond.","A spectacular find.Beyond traditional maps of locations (subway maps, street maps), the book also contains visualization of time, space, networks, concepts and any combination of the above.It contains huge collection of magnificent examples which are well-beyond my expectation.Highly recommended."
1,Shot from the hip,"Disappointing. I sent it back and ate the return postage. There was no context, no notes telling where in Mexico the images came from, no clue to the actual creators of the signage or designs. An interview with even one of the sign painters would have made all the difference for me. I felt like a tourist in the worst sense, a hip tourist, but a tourist nonetheless. At a bricks and mortar bookstore, I would never have purchased this book."
5,Another Romp at Grace and Favor mansion,"Personally, I like Churchill's Grace and Favor mysteries better than her Jane Jeffrey series -- probably partly because, being set during the Great Depression, they have the flavor of a historical novel.The usual cast of residents in a small town by the Hudson River, led by Robert and Lily Brewster, works its way amiably through yet another murder in their town, making this book a nice, relaxing bedtime read."
3,"Interesting, but Weak","Goodrich has both advocates and detractors, both sometimes quite vociferous. She is a good writer, and she has some interesting insights and ideas. I find fault in her excessive reliance upon the medieval Romances (especially those of Chretien de Troyes of the late 12th Century) to reconstruct history. The Romances were intended and written as entertaining fiction and therefore incorporate too much material from ancient Celtic legends, as well as wholly new medieval story ideas. Goodrich should have concentrated instead on earlier sources, including Gildas Sapiens, Nennius, William of Malmesbury and Geoffrey of Monmouth (who all intended to write history), as well as the growing body of archaeological evidence."
4,"Gritty, Believable, and Tense...","The Laserdisc of this movie is in its original widescreen glory. I highly recommend you find a buddy who is dumb enough (like me) to keep buying laserdiscs...I dreaded hearing that one of my all-time top 5 favorite films (The Wages of Fear) was remade in the seventies. But I was mistaken. Friedkin 'modernized' the concept - bringing the plot into the gritty, ugly seventies. The climax truck scene is just as good as the original and possibly even more tense.If you like nail-biting, almost documentary-type cinema check out this sleeper."
4,Sorcerer,"I first saw this movie in a theater when I was a boy. It blew meaway. The suspence is gripping. Thirty years later, it stillholds up. William Friedkin was at his peak with The Exorcist,The Fench Connection, and this movie. Anybody who likes actionwith thought will like this."
3,WIDESCREEN--PLEASE!!! THE WAY I SAW IT IN THE CINEMA.,"Anyone interested in this title already knows the plot ""wages of Fear"" for wages sake ala Wm Friedkin. One of my top 10 favorite films of all time...SINFULLY REPLICATED in 1:33 aspect ratio. All that needs to be said is that this MUST BE RE-RELEASED IN ITS THEATRICAL FORMAT!!!!!!!!After that has been accomplished, please destroy once and for all, the 1:33 master tape, disc, program--all of it. GREEN PEOPLE!!! HERE IS YOUR CAUSE PRIMERO. SAVE THIS FILM AND SAVE THE EARTH! The ultimate greepeace epic film. See it and weep.shullcat2003@hotmail.com"
3,just a bit older now.,the set is good and fun how ever the problem is not the product;it's me. age has a way of MAKING a person see things in a different way.
4,Fond Memories:,I was reminded just how disappointed andangry I was - when they cancelled thisshow. It was so different and the actorswere fabulous.
3,The Ups and Downs,"""To Have and to Have Not"" meets ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""--The layout of the series was pretty thoroughly lifted from the Bogart and Bacall movie, ""To Have and to Have Not"" (LOVED that movie!). It was a likeable cast and I really enjoyed the show when I first watched it. It was fun and had the potential to be a terrific series, but it never really got the chance.The writing was not usually terrific, the acting was uneven and the show lost all direction toward the end in an apparent search to discover where, exactly, it was going. It's a measure of all that's right about the show that I loved it, despite all of those things.Conceptually solid, I'd lay odds some smart, remake-happy producers out there will put a new syndicated production of this show into the works someday. Better luck to their endeavor. ""Gold Monkey"" never got the chance to achieve its potential."
5,"GOOD DANCING MOVES,PHAT GEAR ,TIGHT LYRICS",WHEN MYA CHOOSE SILKK THE SHOCKER TO APPEAR ON THAT BANGING TRACK SHE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS DOING. THAT WAS A PHAT CAR HE WAS ROLLIN'. I'LL LEAVE MY MAN FOR SILKK THE SHOCKER ANY DAY. DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE SOMETHING GOING ON? DO YOU THINK THEY MAKE A GOOD COUPLE? WELL MY WORK IS DONE HERE UNTIL NEXT TIME I'M OUT! MISS LAZY IN OKC-OK
3,Liked the 1st better,"Ok this wasn't half bad, but it wasn't impressive. I jumped maybe once. It's pretty gross but the storyline was just eh. The 1st had you grossed out with the inbreds.. This one had them too it's just they seemed to human like and the day shots were boring..They didn't scare me. Id rent it but not buy. Id never watch it again."
1,wrong turn 2 bad,"The original Wrong Turn was written and filmed so well, Director Rob Schmit done such a great job !!! Now, This sequel flop does not come close, it's a great disapointment. Does not have the same old style horror feel, plot terrible and filmed poorly."
2,So then why is it all about physical beauty,The entire first half is devoted to physical beauty as it was viewed in the 50's.
1,Charming but outdated,"This book is charming, but had I known that it was written in the 1930's, I probably would have passed. It's more like one of those treasures you'd find in the book section of an antique mall. If you like reading something that will take you back to your mother's or grandmothers era, you'll enjoy this book. If you're looking for something you can relate to in 2005, this probably isn't what you're looking for."
4,A total delight!,This book offers delightful light reading with very valuable lessons. A must read in these overly self-entered times where social interaction seems to have been turned on its head.
2,Why Buy This When So Much Better (& Up-to-Date) is Available?,"This is quaint and sweet and the drawings are very 1950's How-To. Being on a serious budget and hoping my teens might take a glance through the book, I found it a waste of money. Instead I highly suggest that you purchase ""A Guide to Elegance : For Every Woman Who Wants to Be Well and Properly Dressed on All Occasions,"" ""Entre Nous : A Woman's Guide to Finding Her Inner French Girl,"" and last but not least, ""What Southern Women Know (That Every Woman Should) : Timeless Secrets to Get Everything you Want in Love, Life, and Work."" Of course anything by Judith Martin is right on track, as well!I collect old magazines and this fits in with what was being written in women's magazines in the '50's. My teens are more than likely to read this book and mock it rather than find it informative."
2,Low budget B movie.,"I have this amazing knack for buying/renting movies that seem really good (judging by the cover) and turn out to be 100% crap. This is another one of them. If there was a plot, it escaped me. Borrow this from a friend, but only if you are depressed and need to watch something horribly stupid to cheer yourself up."
4,Very good Gothic.,"I'll admit I love Gothics and so was delighted to find a new author who writes them. I learned a bit about English history, architecture, and music. While not horribly scary, which was fine by me, there was excellent sense of place, a bit of pathos in the story of the ghosts, and a very enjoyable read."
5,DAAAAAAAAAAAMN!!!!!,"Yo man. Ma peeps luv ths game. Pmp it up wit a 100 GB surround, quadcore processer, and four good hard drives- and dare I say- 300+ Kbps, an u got 1 heluva nwb pwnin machine! Buy it, homes!Pwn on,B0tard"
4,daughter and friend love it,although I have been a fan of the series I dont have the time to play so I have turned my daughter onto the game she is now hooked and is playing online w a friend..maybe not a good idea after all :)
5,My 4 years old son loves them,Ever since we put them on his bedroom wall. He loves them and now he outgrow them. I wish they could make transformers similar to this with all kind of characters.
3,"Been There, Done That, Bought the T-shirt","This season is a bit of a downturn for the series featuring vince and the boys from Queens. This one picks up where Season 3 left off with the gang heading down to South America to film ""Medellin"" and the efforts to get it shown at Cannes.As I watched each episode, I came down with a serious case of deja vu. Their problems were all the same: Vince out of money, Drama trying to resurrect his career and Turtle just trying to score. And while something bad might happen, something better would come along in five minutes or so. I will admit I was pleasantly surprised with the final episode, but it just wasn't enough. I hope they can heighten the tension in Season 5, because the first 3 have been some of the best TV I've seen recently."
4,Xtreme white?,"First off, I hate the word xtreme. I ordered these because I had a headlamp burn out and needed one quickly and didn't have time to go to the autoparts store. When I changed one bulb (leaving the other functional OEM bulb in place) in my Honda Pilot, I was concerned that this bulb would be bluer than the slightly yellow OEM Osram bulb. These are made by Phillips in Germany and look very similar to the Osram (also made in Germany). At night, I turned the headlamps on to see if there was a difference in the color of the light, but there was no difference that my eye could detect. Looking at the front of the vehicle, both headlamps looked identical."
4,For Cons & Clients,"An insightful way to understand and gain more value from consultants from a client perspective, and a useful guide for consultants to understand how to improve the method of delivery.A rather misleading sub-title aiming to be controversial when the content is actually informative and practical. The tone is sometimes too jocular for the content."
3,"Seals well, but difficult to apply","I bought these hoping they would work with my Corelle soup bowls. They do fit and have an excellent, drum-tight seal once applied, but they are difficult to apply. It almost takes 2 people and/or 3 hands. I don't think they would work well for soups due to the difficulty of applying. They work well once applied to bowls with a outer lip or rim, not so well with straight-sided bowls."
5,Spiritual seeking confirmed,John of the Cross speaks to us from across the centuries to affirm our solidarity with seekers from all times. It is comforting to know that we are on the same path as seekers from every generation.
1,Vroom with a View,The book is for anybody that ever wanted a Vespa - Peter conveyed what Vespa owners feel - The bike isn't perfect and life isn't either. It's easy to read - chatty and a good simple travelog - Enjoyed it more because I owe a old Vespa but anyone can enjoy the travelog.
3,Melissa and Doug Yorkshire Terrier Plush,My daughter loves this toy however the one I recieved does not resemble the one being sold. The one I recieved kind of looks like a wolf more than a Yorkshire Terrier.
4,Not what I expected,"This is the ugliest little Yorkie I've ever seen, however it works just great as a model for our clothing line."
4,Just Used the Cards,"I used the cards to make a trivia contest for my 50th birthday. For this purpose, the game was fine."
3,Not a Good Product for Me,"I love Slim Styles PBX products, but cannot take the meal replacements as they are made with a whey base and I cannot handle any milk products as they don't agree with me at all. But the capsules and the granules work fine so I will stick with them."
1,Optical Digital Output Non-Functional,The Optical Digital Output on this cable was designed prior to the Xbox 360 being released. IT DOES NOT WORK. From reading other complaints on the Microsoft Forums apparently none of them work. The S-Video is fine but if you intend to use this product for digital audio do not buy it. Pelican should recall the cables but I haven't heard any hint of an intent to do so and I can't get a response from their 24/7 tech support on the issue.
1,"looks ok, but it ends there","I bought this Crosman target for my son for Christmas and by New years it was finished. The pop targets all broke, both the pop up function and the targets themselves. He has a low powered Airshot, not a 12ga shot gun. Don't waste your money."
3,cool but fragile,"While the concept is great, the targets shattered the first time it was used. They sent a second set, but really what's the point. I have two sons and a bunch of their friends who are really into airsofting and they have created targets of their own to work with the unit, but I am not satisfied what so ever with the product."
2,Sergey Isenko,"It is much worse, than everything, what I read about Oracle before.Generally it is the copied original documentation.Practically there are no normal examples.So sorry."
1,Blame Lion's Gate.,"I saw a pretty healthy compliment of DVD copies of this film on the shelf at Bl0ckbuster a week ago.I guess Lion's Gate has a thing for distributing really bad low budget horror films.This particular film was conceived, written, and directed by a guy who clearly should not be making films. And to top it off, he plays the lead in the film. How's that for retarded?And to make it even worse, some of the credits info on this webpage are incorrect (who the f uck is Ralph Baber?), leading consumers to believe that this ""sequel"" was made by the same director of Dark Harvest."
5,A Refreshing New Light On Classic Hollywood Love Songs,"With his hauntingly beautiful baritone voice, Michael Poss gives a new reflective meaning to some of our favorite movie love themes, as well as some forgotten classics. This is a wonderful album and I'm happy Michael Poss took a risk by producing something that is against all of the ""boy-toy"" mainstream 'pop' groups oversaturating today's radio stations. If you like songs with deep meaning there's the original ""To See Your Face Again"", written by Michael. If you like uptempo big bands songs there's Michael's original ""Love Finds You"", and also the forgotten song ""The Jitterbug"" that was cut from MGM's 1939 'The Wizard Of Oz'. I never get tired of listening to some of these classics when I'm driving in my car. This album totally relaxes me on the way to work. Great songs from a true vocal interpreter!"
3,must have for Conrad Brooks fans,Got this on dvd and a vampire drains people of blood in Jersey and his butler is Conrad Brooks. Cool. Conrad does it again! Now all we fans of Brooks need is Conrad Brooks vs Werewolf and Mystery In Shadows on dvd.
3,OK,"Came across this in the horror section of my video store. It reminded me of Asylum of Satan with it's low low buget and lack of flash, but I'm glad I rented it. The actress who played the female sped up my pulse and it's got Conrad Brooks and Dolores Fuller from the old Ed Wood movies in it. It's based on a true story which is creepy. They should remake this with one more money."
3,A REAL VAMPIRE STORY,This flick is based on a true story and not bad. It's a small independant movie so take it for what it is and you might enjoy it. I loved Nadia!
3,Did not fit my Q9 or Q9m,"They did take it as a return,post office charged 6$ to shop back!! The Mororola Website said this docking station was universal, it was not!!! Sure wish it would have, I was so excited I bought batteries!! I was disappointed"
1,"Rubbish, rubbish, rubbish!","This album is a pile of junk. It's the same formulaic stuff that hundreds of other singers could have put out. The song Wait A Minute is horrific. The lyrics are as base as you can get (there's not a right way / you've had a tired day / let's party the night away / it's on tonight), none of the songs are that funky. Bring me back to the days when music was more about how much money you have, how many women you can have, and how much jewellery one hand can support. Curtis, Marvin, we need ya! In my opinion, this ain't a game ain't worth the effort needed to go outside and buy it. Yuck!!!!!!!!!!"
3,He's workin' his way up!!,I think this cd is OKAY. But he needs some more work and time. For the most I like two songs on this Lp which are Wait a Minute and Wet Me. Try the album though cause I say 2 each is own.
3,Suprizing,"There are some innovative moments on this otherwise standard R n'B album making it a respectable effort from an underrated artist. Wait A Minute shows The Neptunes and Lil' Kim using their combined talents to full effect creating one of the best singles of the year while Out The Ghetto is an emotive ode to escaping the projects. Even the ballads, No More and Keep Your Head Up hold their wieght against the likes of Usher thanks to Rodney Jerkins' production. However, Ray J will need to try harder to stand out in the tough ""game"" of music if he wants to shake the tag of ""Brandy's brother""."
4,With Your Grown Butt,"This CD is hot! The first single with Lil' Kim is here in it's entirety... The beats are banging, and out of the is world! It's very catchy from beginning to end. My only dissapproval was that he got to grown to quick... He was just talking about Let It Go, and That's Why I Lie... Now he talking about wet me, and feel me here. It is a far cry from his original album. The rap cuts are uncensored and cursing is sprinkled here and there. That surprised me. We could have did without that. Just for that, I'm telling Mr. Mitchell... :-) In any event the album is hot. Without the cursing I would have given it a solid 5 stars..."
2,three bad disks,the gods must not have wanted us to see this episode (I believe it was Clinton's first appearance on WNTW); three disks in a row were defective and would not play. Finally gave up. Other discs in this series have been just fine; a bad pressing (or however they make these things)? Customer service was impeccable; no problem there.
3,Fun with a couple flaws,"The voice-changing helmet is fun, but it has a couple issues you don't learn about until you've bought it.One, to activate the voice-changing you must continuously press a button located on the front of the helmet. You cannot just turn it on and have everything you say sound like a Cyberman. You have to hold your hand to your face the entire time.Two, there's almost no backside to the helmet. The helmet would be more properly described as a voice-changing mask. The back of the mask contains an adjustable plastic band for keeping the mask on your head. There is a top and curvature to the product making is sort of like a helmet, but it's only impressive when viewed from the front. From the back it looks like a mask."
5,"intense, excellent","shostakovitch wrote crazy awesome music, and worked with the borodin string quartet while he was composing quartets; this suggests (to me) that the borodin quartet is the best suited in the world to interpret his works; though the original members who worked with shostakovitch no longer play in the group, the original cellist was still with the group at the time of this recording, and surely, experience, knowledge, and wisdom have been shared with new members as they were introduced to the group.this is amazing, powerful, often bewildering stuff- i love it."
1,No Instruction,"I was hopeful for this, really like others in the series. Just starts with no instruction and that is not helpful for someone just starting out. perhaps if you are already familiar with modern dances it would be a better fit. It was confusing! Would be nice if video had a warm up section you could choose also..."
1,Wish I could Return,"I bought this video thinking it would be easy enough to catch on to, but I was disappointed. The steps were way to complicated and the angle of the camera following the instructor made it very difficult to catch on. I have another workout video which I love and just wanted something to add to my collection and also add some variety. I'll be sure not to pick up these 10minute videos again. I also didn't like that only she was on the video. I like when there are a group of 4-5 ladies making it fun."
2,Problem with Rhino Launcher,Every time I do a soft boot all the settings in Pro Launcher disappear. I have sent RhinoCode several e-mails and have received no reply as how to fix this problem. Until this problem is fixed the software is not very useful.
4,A Trip Down the Nile,This is wonderful documentary. Visit modern and ancient places and shoot rapids with adventurers in inflatable dinghies. The camera sits at the front of the boat and even goes underwater if the cameraman falls in. I watched it on a 10 foot screen and the only thing missing was water to get wet. See magnificent waterfalls and meet fascinating people as you travel the length of the Nile from its source.
2,Short Film of a Long River,"Having recently returned from a week in Egypt absorbing the history around the Nile and spending 3 days on the very well traveled Egyptian section of the Nile, my husband and I were interested in more insight and knowledge. This looked just right. Soon, I realized I'd seen this years ago. The photography was beautiful, though with such an exciting and groundbreaking adventure, I found the accompanying narration and facts sadly lacking in detail. Just as an interesting section would begin, like in Sudan, the narration and film skimmed on and provided nothing of value. Had I realized how cut up the film was, I would not have bought it. It's only 47 minutes long and much of it is spent covering the characters instead of the Nile. I wouldn't buy again or recommend it to others unless they wanted to see the scenery. A great disappointment."
4,Fab but could be fabbier,"So far, this is one of my least favorite in the series.; having said that, it was still a good book. I just feel that Rennison is slipping because so many of the funny parts in this book were just events/jokes paraphrased from earlier books (ex: setting fire to the pensioner). At this rate the ATAFFS series is going to go stale and I'd hate to see that happen because it truly is spectacular."
4,Startled by his Furry Shorts,My daughter just loves these books so much that we also bought the movie. We have watched the movie at least a dozen times and she is sharing the books with me and her friends.
5,Gazillion bubble maker is excellent toy,"My kids and the kids in the neighborhood love this bubble maker. It is by far the best bubble maker we have ever had. It really makes a ton of bubbles with just one wave, and the large bubbles are amazing. I would highly recommend this product for any child."
1,EXPIRED! UNBELIEVABLE,"I bought this strips on December 2008 and they were already expired, and it was not just for one month, it expired since 2007!!! I live in Mexico so I was unable to ask for a refund, it's unbelievable that they are selling expired medical stuff, don't you think about the risk it represents? I hope you do..."
5,Best bang for buck,I had this installed myself 6 months ago - really easy. I will recommend anybody who is looking for decent one in market which has good sink depth and quality.
5,My Review,"It Remind Of Real Steam Engines, Real Diesel Engines, Real Electric Engines, Real Railway Coaches, Real Railway Trucks & Real Railways"
4,Another Thomas Movie,"It's a Thomas movie, my son loves him so we had to buy it. Just fyi, we got this at c o s t c o for a combo dvd/blu ray pack for fourteen dollars."
5,Thomas is a huge part of our household because of my lil man!,"My son will be happy once he receives this for xmas, loves all his Thomas DVD's and he'll be happy to add this one to his collection!"
2,British Are Coming 1 & 2,"This is more of an overall review, as I bought both Volume 1 and Volume 2 separately.Volume 2 is much, much better (4 stars). Vol. 2 has better songs and is definitely worth the price. Vol. 1, though, is not worth the price (2 stars).I personally think they should have taken the best songs from both and crammed a full 70+ minutes onto one disc. Then it would've been a five-star CD!Or you could buy Volume 2 and a Best of the Kinks and you'd be set!"
3,"This is an ""OK"" album","From other ""TRANCE"" cd's that I have listened to, I would say that this does not really constitute as being trance music. I would like to say that it is a good cd, just not what the title would cause most music listeners to believe the music actually is...or something like that...it's your choice..."
4,Great Binocs!,"Great binocs, small and easy to carry with a sharp view. Love them and can't wait to hunt with them."
2,A rip off,I got this for Christmas and was disappointed in this years making of the superbowl. All it had was the four games to the superbowl without any commentary or action packed highlights of the season. Waste of money!
5,Star Wars the BEST!!!!,"star wars episode 3 is awesome!!! In this gamee you can be Jedi's and can actually duel people. In two player mode you can be Anikin or obi-oun or however you say his name. In story mode you can duel other people like count douku, general grieveous, and mace windu. When you do two player you cab be obi oun or anikin, AND any person OR droid that you deafeat in a duel in stror mode. In two player mode if you are general grieveous and you give a good hard slash or stab on anikin or count douku they will give a funny little scream. Story mode is fun but SOME levels are hard. They should make the duels a little bit easier. All the moves are really fun. here's a tip: When you start ther game it automaticaly sets the dificulty to normal, but you can switch it to easy. Overall this game is so fun!! hope you have fun getting this game!!! P.S. If you get it at best buy, they will give you $10 off any purchase there!!"
3,Pretty Fun,"I got this game when it first came out and was playing it before I saw the movie. After playing the game awhile, I finally went and saw the movie. Of course, there is no compairison between the two. The movie is usually always better than the game anyhow so I wasn't dissapointed. Anyway, the graphics in the game were not all that good, and the voice work was terrible. They could have used the actually actors voices in the game. They did however put little clips from the movie in the game which I thought was a neat idea. You can learn some really awesome moves and get the cheats that will unlock all the moves and even some really bizaar light sabers.However, the game is really short. Only 17 chapters I believe. But, it's still fun to play and try and become a Jedi Master."
2,Yawn...,"Bought it when it came out, played through it in about 6 hours, have never put it back in my machine. Translation: RENTAL. :)Even though it was near the end of the line for the PS2, its graphics fell waaaaayyyy short of other competition like God of War. They seemed to mostly phone this one in, like many movie tie-ins. I'd basically describe it as a less-fun Double Dragon with lightsabers and a broken ""versus"" mode.The greatest compliment I can honestly give it is that it was entertaining to watch non-gamers whack each other with lightsabers in the versus mode at a recent party. It's so badly done, the playing field is pretty even--your best gaming research and effort will still leave you dead-even with a zombie pressing buttons beside you."
4,Anikin Rocks,"I love the way this game follows the movie. Anikin and Obi Wans voices are kind of monotone and Anikin keeps saying the same stupid, sarcastic phrases over and over, but at least he's a consistently bad actor in the movies and in this video game. The game itself is fun and interesting but it's not challenging enough. My brother is only 7 and he's gotten pretty far in it already."
4,A good rental,"The game is pretty fun, along the lines of Lord of the Rings slasher games. It's very short and pretty easy, unfortunately. The animation/fighting system seems pretty good, though the ""bonus"" fight game needs something more sophisticated. Storyline is the same as the movie and even includes lots of scenes from the movie (which is a plus). Out of all the prequel movie-themed games, this one is the best, I think.Since it's so short (>1 day to beat), it's better to wait for a price drop or rent it."
3,Disappointing,"The graphics for this game are awful, reminescent of 2 years ago, and after the first two missions everything is the same and gets very boring. Go with Star Wars battlefront instead, it is much better."
1,Great game!!!!!!!,this is a really cool Star wars game! The money is worth it. this game has nice graphics and tells the story of Episode III in case u didn't see the movie. Overall this is a must have.
5,Buy it,"This game is amazing, even if it is short. The lightsaber duels are the best part. Once you are Darth Vader, you can do pretty much anything you need to in the game.Most of the droids in the game are really easy. The only ones that aren't that easy are the crab droids and the destroyer droids.But with the right moves you can get them. You can do lightsaber battles over and over again in the vs. mode, either with another player or the CPU. Get this game if you are a Star Wars fan"
4,way underrated,this game is good not as good as battlefront but good most movies ive played are good lets go on shall we star wars e3 for short is a good the game has you in the shoes of obi wan or aniakin for a seris of missons that follow the movie its not very close but close its really fun /bads avrege character models short game thats it for bad now for/ goods movie footge fun lasting gameplay bonus missons. so thats the goods now lets be explain the game like i said before the game puts you in shoes of anikan or obi wan that follows the movie this game reminds me of the force unleased because you can upgrade you powers lighting force puch etc. you use force points to upgrade you earn force ponits by completeing missons you defeat enimies and the rateing you get for defeating enimies like god of war. to cut this short for fan buy its cheap for a new copy if youre not a fan but like it rent its
4,Yup its Grey's.,"If you want to collect Grey's sets, I guess then you will love it. Although you can probably see most episodes online now."
2,White box ships with black legs! Why?,"I ordered two white innerside Delta Pro boxes. They arrived with black legs! The legs bolt to each corner of the box so you can attach it to the bed of your truck. This made no sense to me so I called Delta direct and asked about this. They told me that this was correct. I am not rating the quality of the box here, just the lack of attention to detail. Actually this isn't just a small detail, and since the company is aware of it and chooses to not do anything about it, I give 2 stars. My boxes were both damaged upon arrival, but this wasn't Delta's fault. I would have reordered, except for the issue with the legs."
4,Post Apocalypse Worlds,"An interesting film from the 1970's, part of a string of movies -- such as SOYLENT GREEN, THE OMEGA MAN, DAMNATION ALLEY, A BOY AND HIS DOG,etc. --which deal with civilization after some violent cataclysm. Yul Brynner was no spring chicken when he did this role but performs well. Max Von Sydow as the Baron (originally it was to been called THE BARONEY) delivers as a man struggling to keep the people in his charge from being overcome by the violent forces outside his compound and from extinction. Then there is Big Bill Smith. Has anyone ever played better-- and more -- crazed over the edge psychos than this son of a gun? I think not. In an interview he said that in his death scene, while rats ran over him, one actually crapped in his mouth. Now that's taking one for the team!"
4,Juicy,"I bought this book in 1997, 10 years ago, and it was already 5 years old. It was enjoyable but a slog to get through and not all was retained in my head at the end of the read. I was left tired and I moved on. The true value of the book, however, became apparent as the years passed - every re-read of portions gave pleasure through forgotten information freshly revealed, or insights put forth in the book that have finally sunk in, or new color/nuance to previously remembered arguments. I also bought one other, more recent, book of his, ""On Equilibrium"", and it complements ""Voltaire's Bastards"" nicely. The intervening years continue to demonstrate the validity of many arguments in the book, thus getting closer to the definition of a 'classic'. One of my best book purchases."
4,Excellent CD,"I really love this artist. I don't understand why Leona Naess never made it to the Top 40, but she's still wonderful in this album. My favorite songs are Promise to Try, the title track, and All the Stars. I would recommend this album to anyone. She has a light, easy-going, breezy sound to her music, and it never becomes tedious. Also, if you want to find a male counterpart to this music, I would suggest Pete Yorn's ""musicforthemorningafter""."
3,be careful,"I have owned this book for a while now. One has to be very careful if trying any of the processes in the book. You need a background in chemistry or you will end up like the author. There are some good recipes within. Just remember, if you get caught with this book, you will be deemed a ""terrorist"". No, I'm not kidding"
2,Publication Date,"This 2nd edition of this book was published eariler then the first edition of The Poor Man's James Bond, Volume 1 I purchased elesware. As a result, I overpayed for an old edition which the pages were even yellow with age."
2,"60""s Radical - WOW!","I'm not sure why I bought this book. I guess I thought that it would be cool to be able to recognize booby traps or learn how to defend your home and family if the collapse of civilization as we know it really would happen. I was wrong! The author (who's probably passed on by now) is a real sicko! I'm certain that this was written for 60's radicals in confrontations with the authorities. This book is dangerous in the wrong hands. The only good feeling I got from it was that since 9-11, most of the easy to get chemicals listed aren't so easy to get anymore. And the people who sell them are more leary about the people who try and buy them, at least I sure hope they are!I wouldn't waste my money."
3,"Interesting read, but many instructions in small cheaply reprinted presentation","Hey i am 60 yrs old, bought this for entertainment and reference if the stuff hits the fan. There are too many articles that i can hardly read with my glass that are not that strong, so bad print job, you need to spend more time and get a typist to redo all this info, it looks like cut and paste. Now there are a lot of good advice and safety tips offered , but this is just a basic starting point not a reference manual . Like a Militia's comic book, large but still needs a lot of work , i enjoyed it but the quality needs to be ramped up. Also the Section on hand to hand combat could be left out , and more info and instructions on previous chapters. I found the historical info fascinating ."
1,A bit of a concern,"I'm a bit concerned about buying a book that falls in the same category as the Anarchist cookbook. Books like that are a red flag for any one who purchases them, and should be advised that the content in this book may or may not be legal in your country, state, or county. Theres a video online, and before I could even watched it, turned it off because I'm not to keen on ""anarchist"" type activities. This book is practically the same as the ""cook books"" with a different title."
3,Is not so good!!,"I bought this product for all my daughters, but it is not so good... it needs the hair dryer, it is much better the Ceramic Hair Straightened, this article is good as a complement!"
5,Excellent,Absolutely full of relevant information on early Bedford TN residents & land speculators - Many from NC.I found so many families that have not been studied before. Lots of new information. I highly recommend!
4,"upbeat, catchy introduction to a melancholy band","Import prices nonwithstanding, this should be the first HSH album you get. As of early 2002, only two of his albums are available domestically - ""Manic Expressive"" and ""Home is Where You Hang Yourself"" - and they're less consistently good than this.This album of all remixes features the same repetitive, silvery groove of his solo tracks, but the variety in singers and lyrical mood mitigates most of the monotony that ""Manic Expressive"" fell prey to.Be warned - of the 9 tracks on this album, 4 also appear on the 2nd (remix-only) disc of ""Home is Where You Hang Yourself."" But this album is better - the tracks by Elastica and Logic in particular are acerbic, buoyant, and irrepressible."
4,excellent pure cello for the casual relaxed listener,"As an untrained listener, you can find pure joy in the range of sounds and passion Ma's cello brings to this cd."
5,Film Artistry at its Best!,"When a chef loves food, she creates a masterpiece for the tastebuds; when an artist loves their subject, they create a masterpiece for the eyes. Visions of Greece is a masterpiece of filmmaking. From the vast array of content to the beauty of the music in tandem with the scenery to the poetic narrative - Ah! Simply beautiful! I have viewed the others in the Visions series and none hold a candle to this one. Visions of Italy is beautiful (my 2nd favorite), but not as vast and lovely as ""Visions of Greece"". Amazing! I have owned this for many years now and I still watch it. It takes you on a journey, both visually and auditorily-you can almost smell the fields of roses in Rhodes, without leaving the comfort of your own home. I will never part with this DVD.I would love to know how to get a hold of the soundtrack to the DVD, but I haven't found it available yet.I also hope they are working on a BluRay version.Bravo, Acorn Media, Bravo!"
4,does it's job,"I ordered this brace to replace one i was previously using. It is well padded, but a little bigger than the other brand. It is also very well constructed."
1,This is THE WORST show ever!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!! Did you ever watch the ""New Class?"" It was absolutely HORRIBLE!!! Nothing like the REAL ""SBTB"" at all. This one STINKS (and that's putting it nicely). Sure, there's Dennis Haskins as Mr. Belding, as awesome as ever. But that's where the compliments for this one end. There's the ""Screech-type"" character, the ""Zack-type"" character, the ""Kelly-type"" hotty...need I go on? ""The New Class"" goes down as one of the WORST television programs in the history of the world! DON'T BUY IT!!!"
3,NICE :),"THIS IS A FINE EYE GLITTER. I WAS VERY SURPRISED HOW FINE THE GLITTER WAS WHEN I RECEIVED IT. YES I WILL ORDER MORE.THANK YOU,SHANELL"
5,Excellent Travel Guide,These are excellent travel guides with lots of color pictures. (A picture is worth a 1000 words.) It was been excellent in helping me plan my 10 day trip and deciding where to go and what to see. The best travel guide of all the ones I looked at.
2,sound broke with in a few months,"This was a Christmas present for my 4 year old daughter. She loved it at first, but after a couple of months of use the sound quit working. The ""clicking"" sound helps a child know that the picture has been taken and also adds to the fun. We cannot figure why it suddenly stopped working or how to get it to come back on- very frustrating. Now the camera gets little use. Also the picture quality is poor, regardless of sound."
5,Great camera for little kids,"We bought this camera for our son's 3rd birthday. He had an old camera of ours that didn't work so he was excited to have his own, especially since it worked. It's a very cool and simple to use camera. Within about 5 minutes of opening it and looking at it with dad, he understood what the buttons did and was clicking away taking pictures. It's super easy to upload the pictures onto our computer and the picture quality is much better once loaded onto the computer.Another cool thing (that I didn't notice when I bought it) is the binocular eye piece. I think it would have been hard for him if it wasn't.This is a great camera - it's very cool to see what he takes pictures of and especially those everyday things that you can now see from a 3-year-old's perspective. If you have a kid who is even a little interested in pictures and photography I think this is a must have!!"
4,Durable and fun,"This camera is very durable as they say but the picture don't come out as clear as a regular digital camera. However, they turn out better than the cheaper models on the market. It's a fun camera for kids I just wish the quality was a little better for printing the pictures off."
1,Horrible picture quality,"I was incredibly dissapointed with the picture quality from this camera. I bought it for a 4 year old neice who is too little for a real camera but who appreciates the pictures she takes with my digital camera. I am worried that this Christmas present, which she really wants, is going to terribly disspoint. I'm thinking about returning it or researching the quality of other children's digital cameras."
4,working with copper contact paper,I ordered this product for the special purpose of covering the door of a small refrigerator in our RV. This did not work as it is impossible to get it on without wrinkles. We tried various ways but finally gave up. I think for smaller projects it would be fine. And it has a nice copper look. Very metalic. It seems to stretch as you work with it so you need to get it layed on correctly the first time with no wrinkles. It didn't work for our application.
5,Placebo effect?,"This is my first Hemi Sync CD, and it really did seem to work as advertized. Who knows, maybe it was just the placebo effect, but while listening to it I was able to focus well, and sort of shut out the rest of the world. I didn't go so far as to discover the meaning of life, but I've only listened to Einstein's Dream once; maybe that will come later. Oh, I liked the music too."
1,The Title Says It All,"Unfortunately this book is all politics. Using cherry picked info to back her views, Ms. Hendershott spins just as well as any Fox News pundit. Sure, any person with common sense understands that pedophilia is dead wrong, but it doesn't automatically follow that all of the assertions in her book are then true. She rails against Clinton's sexual indiscretion while extolling Bush's virtue, while he lied to us to get us into a war, has approved of torture, works steadily to dismantle all environmental protections and has been at the head of the most corrupt administration in our nation's history.Hypocricy is also a form of deviance if one believes the truth to be a norm."
4,Dog Toy for Jack Russell,This stuffed animal was purchase for a Jack Russell Terrier. He loved the other skunk to shreds. His orginal cuddlekins was a wee bit larger. I was please they shipped immediately.
5,"an emotion-charged, roller coaster ride","An emotion-charged, roller coaster ride on the subject of intergenerational love, Howatch's book deals close to the bone. Neville Asygarth is surely one of the sexiest protagonists in fiction, with his mass of frailties and weaknesses. Yet ultimately it is his belief in Love and its redemptive powers that lift the ending. And of course, he is right.The subject of an old/young love has rarely been dealt with in fiction, albeit with such perception and sensitivity. As a younger partner in one such relationship, her observations strike very close to home, and the last few pages, describing the twilight of Aysgarth's life and his search for forgiveness left tears in my eyes.I finished the book with a sense of loss and regret...too real, the book had been. Much too real...thank you Ms. Howatch. I thought you had peaked with the excelent Wheel of Fortune, but I'm glad you didn't."
1,Mr capone e aka a chicano wanna be,I actually can belive someone is defending a pakistany rapper who tries to pimp the chicano rap culture. If you like his music well guess what he basically pimped you cause this vato aint mexican this dude is Paki period. A cholo wanna be i rather listen to mr shadow or anybody else thats actual mexican or chicano. But not this guy
1,an almost completely useless dictionary,"i found the dictionary to be more frustrating than helpful as a learning aid to Yoruba. There are innumerable amazing omissions, and equally bizarre inclusions - why have the yoruba word for ""kwashiorkor"" and no word for ""room""? Take any common term, ""inside"" for example, and you will find no equivalent for it. While I respect that the author has certainly listed a lot of words, most of them have little practical use. I would recommend the publishers to find another yoruba dictionary, because I felt I was well and truly ripped off"
5,Outstanding look at Baseball History.,"This book is really cool, an interesting and informative look at Baseball. I am a Bridgeport fan too, and this book is a fine addition to the ""Images of America"" / ""Images of Baseball"" series. It is filled with great historical pictures and stores and I can't imagine anyone being disappointed by this book."
5,Overhead door remote,This is the best price i have found these anywere and they work flawless for many years they come with instructions on how to program them as well
5,Garage Door remote,We were told that we needed a whole new garage door opener because this remote was no longer made. WRONG!!We were delighted to find it on Amazon- it works great and we even bought another one for our golf cart.
5,reliable remote with fast delivery from Amazon,These work for years and years. The battery lasts for a long time and is easy to replace. We just needed to get an extra for our property caretaker.
4,Liftmaster 61lm,Good product for the price. Works very well. Had slight problem with switch setting. Had to change sw1 different than on the original opener!
3,Is it a mouse or garage door opener?,I bought two to replace the non-existent openers that came with a new house. They programmed beautifully. So why a three?1) You have to almost always hit the button twice before the door opens. This is true for both of the openers I have.2) Closing/opening the battery door has a tendency to flip dip switches.
5,Great book on a local landmark,If you are interested in old buildings and/or the history of downtown Little Rock then this book is an interesting read. The book profiles the building from its early beginnings through current times. The old building has quite an impressive history.
1,swiss travel,This book is mainly for those traveling by train or bus. It was not very helpful for traveling by auto although it did mention some things to see in planning routes.
1,"Sorry, the geyser didn't geyser","I had to send this toy back. The geyser did not geyser, just a trickle so I'm glad I tried it out before I had my granddaughter over to use it! What a disappointment. Nothing like the picture!"
4,Fun water toy!,"This thing looks flimsy, but we've had it for 2 summers and it's still going strong. I keep expecting it to break, but it hasn't... even with my 18 month old & 4 year old. It's definitely not very high quality, but it is what it is... a water toy, and it works."
1,Arms didn't work,"Arms didn't work, so it just sprayed water through the little tubes, making 6 little sprinkle arms that didn't move. Defective and cheap."
1,Nothing like the picture,"What a disappointment! The tubes got stuck in a rigid position and either shot in one direction or into the ground. The middle ""geyser"" barely went a foot off the ground. My 2 and 1 year olds were bored with it, except for all the water it poured out the bottom to make puddles to jump in. Sending this dud back."
2,Geyser not such a blast sprinkler,"I bought this for my kids, ages 12 and 10. From the picture shown, it looks great for their age group. This was a big disappointment for all of us when I turned the water on. The water was not that high or forceful. This is more for younger kids."
2,Doesn't match the picture,"I bought this thinking it would look like the image on the front, but it doesn't. My water pressure seems normal, but it doesn't shoot up a spray high and thick like the image, and the arms don't work very well either."
5,A five-star book bridging leadership theory and practice!,"This book bridges the theory and practice of leadership by focussing on the remarkable story of Coach Bill Snyder and the tranformation of the Wildcat Football Program, Kansas State University, and the community of Manhattan, Kansas. Drs. Scott and Shoop are to be commended for selecting a leader whose purpose is to give significance to others rather than seek it for himself. The authors are to be further applauded for taking perspectives and quotes from a group representative of those people Bill Snyder has impacted: players and their families, university employees and students, and citizens of Manhattan and the state of Kansas. The lessons are very practical; Bill Snyder's philosophy of continuous improvement can be freely adopted by anyone."
5,Prayers of the Cosmos: Meditations on the Aramaic Words of Jesus,"This is a book I have treasured for over twenty years, and have given to family members, two pastors, and this Christmas, to the members of my choir. It consists of the Aramaic translations of the Lord's prayer and the Beatitudes, and this earthy and mystical language speaks of our relationship to God and to each other in a way that is so much more accessible to me than the translations from the Greek. There are breathing meditations that accompany the verses."
5,Revelation,"This is one of the most important books in my collection of Spiritual literature. The inspiring ideas are clearly and simply communicated, and the book is laid out in a beautiful yet easy to read format. Seeing the aramaic script is amazing, and I can't say enough about learning these prayers to use for your meditation and contemplation practice. I often carry it with me in my backpack so I can read from it where ever I am. A profound and moving way to come closer to the essence of the Christ consciousness."
5,Spell-Binding Reading!,"Preface: Usually, I don't like ""middle"" books... the second in a trilogy, etc., I find them ""pasty"", as in school paste, used to bind the good parts of the story together. That said, ""The Binder's Road"" is a happy departure from such gluey fare. In ""Illumination"", Ms. McGarry Created the world of Eiden Myr, a world where magic is the norm, and to be without it, an embarrassment. She created within this world a cast of characters as diverse and as integrated as a snowstorm, with all the swirls of intrigue, pathos, and love as the analogy can allow. She left me wanting more... and in The Binder's Road, she delivers. She has created a new cast, separate yet tied by just enough threads to Illumination to make readers of the first book to think ""Aha..."" without leaving new readers thinking ""Wha...?"" If Rich characterizations and fantastic worlds made real are the elements you look for in your reading, read both of these and salivate with me while we wait for the third book!"
4,Frost avienta unas firmes rolas!,"These two albums are not Frost's most consistent--that was East Side Story, back in 1992. But they do have some of his strongest performances. Dope lyrics, chicano-style hip-hop production, and some songs in Spanish or partly in Spanish. KRS-ONE once said a great DJ can create a mood. Frost's records create a mood. In reality, you have to skip some of the ""bling-bling"" stuff, but he keeps it firme on more than half of his songs."
4,Good...But classic?,"Don't get me wrong, this is an alright CD. But that's it. Alright. Huge T.I. fans will enjoy it, but in all honesty, on this overlooked debut, T.I. was still in his formative years. He does his thing but this CD is not a classic by any stretch of the imagination. It has it's highs & lows. Primarily, no tracks here stand out as being as brilliant as anything on ""Trap Muzik"" or ""Urban Legend"", with the exception of the introspective ""Still Ain't Forgave Myself"". Nothing is wack, necessarily, it's just that nothing is really outstanding. It's an enjoyable CD, but it's certaintly not a must have."
5,Erin Go Bragh,"I bought this for a St. Patrick's day book club meeting and my table looked great. I had Shamrock napkins, white china and Irish tea cups. I love the quality of this tablecloth but buy it BIG as they shrink after washing and drying."
2,weird hypnosis stuff,"I was expecting music with certain sounds to trigger brain waves. What I got was a guy with a funny accent telling me to relax each individual part of me for 15 minutes. I did feel somewhat rested when it was over, but I think I would have after closing my eyes that long anyway, with or without the hypnosis voice."
2,Not Quite OEM Quality,"If you are looking for a quality OEM or near-OEM part for your Jeep YJ or TJ, look elsewhere. As a general rule, if you are looking for quality, pay a quality price...under $5.00US is not a quality price. The internal housing is rather flimsy causing the lock/latch pin to pop out of place and the lock button's raised lettering isn't even painted white (as the picture would lead you to believe). 9 times out of 10 the clips that hold your original OEM lock and door latch rods in place have broken (as did mine), so if all else fails (on this cheap piece of Taiwanese junk) you can simply use the clips as a replacement in your original OEM door latch."
3,A rare scare for gamers,"This was an interesting mystery game that proceed to get more and more creepy as I went along..They just don't make game stories like this anymore, where you actually feel like you are a part of the story as opposed to having some story shoved down your throat...I miss the integrity the Gabriel Knight mysteries used to provide, in fact I just plain miss old school adventure gaming in general..."
4,Make sure you get the right version,I was disappointed that this version did not have the extras like more options to buy and staff to hire. Be careful which version you buy!
1,Stinks,This game is kind of cool in the demo but in the real version it STINKS!!!!!!!I can't believe i even bought it.It is a waste of money.If they make a version that is more like the demo i will give it a 5 star.
1,Incredibly Boring,"Takes only a couple of days to totally get the hang of this game. After you've bought all the upgrades, it's just a matter of buying ingredients and selling lemonade at the Hexa stadium. Mind-numbing."
2,disappointing,"Most of the book dispenses obvious biking advice. I had hoped for more, such as good exercises to balance the leg muscles to keep knees and joints healthy."
4,Horsemanship for the Backcountry,"Delightful treatise on horsemanship, keen insight, well-written. Information, storytelling, wisdom, and insight portraying Montana wilderness and horsemanship ethics.Sid Gustafson DVMNothing regarding horses is complete, however ;-)"
4,Experiencia fue excelente,Hola a todos:Mi experincia fue excelente. Me llego a tiempo y buena condiciones. Se ve bien el producto. Se lo recomiendo
5,You came in this thing?,"The Millenium Falcon looks true to its description - rough on the outside, but more than capable of taking on the Empire. No way would I call this a fragile toy. It's well built and very solid, with plenty of room for imagination. This is the Star Wars' fan's dream toy, with lights and sounds for effect. Proper care of such a treasure goes with the territory, but only reasonable care. It's also a pleasure to know that whoever designed the toy watched the movies carefully - all the details are there.We got this for our son this afternoon and took it out of the box to check it out, putting in the batteries. My husband wanted one and so did I! Get this and you will not regret it - and May the Force Be With You!!!"
1,Definately NOT Recommended - It's a LEMON!,"My complaints are similar to most of those already posted - the biggest being that the computer just shuts down any time I try to use it for anything other than checking email or typing a Word document. I can't even burn a single CD without it turning itself off after getting through one or two songs. And watching movies on the fabulous 16"" screen? Nope. You won't even get through the opening credits. The thing runs so hot on the bottom forget about even using it on your lap! I paid way too much money for this thing for it to be this worthless. I will never by another Sony computer and will advise everyone I know not to either. If I could have given this thing a zero star rating I would have."
2,poor assembly instructions,Floor Stand for the Omron IntelliSense Professional Digital Blood Pressure Monitor HEM-907XLrecently ordered and received this; came with a missing screw; poor assembly instructions;after a lot of trial and errors we finally managed to put it together; DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THE ONE IN THE PICTURE;CHEAP STUFF!
5,Great Show for the First Seasons....Worth putting out on DVD,"This is one of those shows that has an amazing theme: High School in Public. It is not only tells high school stories but teacher stories. It is well balanced where anyone can watch it. It was a minor hit for a number of years but I think the main problem was the cast changes were too much. I understand how some characters need to be written out but there were too many, too quickly. By the end of the series, the cast only featured a few members from the first show. I also thought the students needed to be structured better. Most students were only featured for a few episodes.Either way, this was a series I have been looking forever to come out on DVD. I got my Freaks and Geeks but why not Boston Public. And I would probably only be interested in the first few seasons but it was still a strong show that I think has a decent cult following."
5,Clever approach to difficult topic,Finally a book that addresses the common problem of negative conversation. This book helped my family and my personal relationships at work. My husband and I own a business and this book allowed us to work through a very difficult situation. We are also pastors and have used this at church and have all the leaders in the church read this book Fantastic job.
2,Not as good as you think,"The gun isn't all that bad but all it says about range and fps it still has none. It says it has an ajustable hop-up but mine never came with one. the scope is nice and the lazer is very cool but overal the gun isn't worth the money a paid. Another thing is the magazine. yes it may hold 100 rounds but after every fifteen you have to pull down a lever and shake it untill you have sum. If your still not novinced, thats not good for wars. Also the tiny hole in the clip wher the bullets go into (for the lever and shake thing) is to small for any good fast reload. Lastly it is to small. I'm not expressing enoug about the 3:4 size. nest to an axual sixe it is about four inches off each end, wich is too uncomfterble for the many wars ive had. So i'm selling mine."
1,B*S,"This gun sucks completly, dirrections sucked!i couldnt get it together, then i did, and broke in 20 shots! buy a better gun."
5,Forever a favorite,"This is one of my favorite albums. It has several songs including some rather obscure ones that I really enjoy. The Homecoming is especially well done and my favorite version of this lovely song. He is always professional and the arrangements delightful, not over orchestrated for the most part, like so much piano music is."
4,Narnia CD's,"Having read the Narnia stories multiple times, I was pleased to find that Focus on the Family Radio Theater adhered faithfully to the stories in their production. The professionals used for the voices (ex: Paul Scofield as Narrator) did an outstanding job and made these stories come alive. Outstanding!"
1,listen before you purchase,I thought I was buying an unabrdged version which was the first disappointment. Also the sound is uneven so that I had to keep adjusting the volume. Sometimes the music nearly obscured the voices of the actors entirely. Most of the actors were excellent and pleasing to the ear. This was not the case with the voice of Aslan which I found to be ridiculous and at times downright creepy. Listen before u buy.
2,Somewhat frustrating,"I purchased this for my 3-year old daughter this past summer. Although she enjoyed running through the water, the main attraction for her was the spinning ears feature. Unfortunately, the ears seldom spin, and when they do, they usually will get stuck within a few minutes. I kept having to manually push them to get them started up again which was very frustrating for the both of us. Overall, I would not recommend this sprinkler unless your child does not mind the ears remaining stationary most of the time."
5,Solo pianist that is true to his music,"Slight Chance of Rain takes the listener on a path of experience through the eyes of a truly talanted musician. Throughout this CD, the listner is rewarded with the superb composition and performance from this solo pianist. Music lovers should consider this CD a must for their collection."
3,A mixed bag,"This movie does very well as a modern update of the 70's flicks with plot elements from the 60's. The title sequence is awesome. However, as the ""final"" Godzilla movie, celebrating fifty years of film history, made in 2004, I expected more. Most of the monsters appear too briefly, the stuff with Minilla just doesn't fit well, and Monster X/Kaiser Ghidora is almost as uninspired as Orga. Ghidora deserves a better incarnation."
2,"if you like goofy ,you'll like this.","So this is how they're going out. A spacemen vs human movie with a little REDICULOUS Zilla tossed in. At least it was original..... originally barrowed from many other movies. Come on... this is not very good. And someone comparing Ryuhei Kitamura to Quentin Tarantino. Sounds good, but I want QT directing Kill Bill not King Kong. I've seen Ryuhei Kitamura's other flicks and they were pretty good, but he got way to goofy on this. I get what he was going for, but there's a reason the 70's Godzilla flicks are on MST 3000."
2,Disappointing...,"This is not only Power Rangers & Matrix rolled together in a Godzilla flick, but also a bit of Star Wars too! I was disappointed that we didn't see that much of Godzilla and considering the effort put forth in Godzilla 2000, this at times is pretty hoaky. They could have left King Cesar & the Spider monster out and a few others. I like that monsters attack everywhere Bejing, Sydney, but the movie just lacked PUNCH! The script needed to be tighter (too many sub-plots). Effects were more impressive than previous outings, but did get over the top when trying to figure out what's happened. And why tell me why did we never hear Godzilla's main theme? It's not a Godzilla flick without it!"
3,not enough Godzilla,"It was good to see the whole cast of Toho monsters (some very briefly) in this movie, this movie suffered (as many of them do) with not enough of Godzilla. He pretty much shows up half-way through.I hope Toho isn't serious about this being the Big G's last movie."
4,King of the Monsters!!!!,My son and I love Godzilla (Yes even the American version). While this is not the best of the series it is still a great movie. Although the fight seqences are frustratingly short and Mecha-Godzilla is absent. If this is supposed to be the last movie for ten years why leave out one of Godzilla's greatest nemesis? Also absent is the Mothra larva (or baby Mothra as my son calls them).As implausible as the story line is I'm sure the could've squeezed them in. All in all not a bad movie. Now my son and I have to sit back and wait for Peter Jackson's rendition of 'King Kong'.
5,nice,This is a cutesy first DVD to keep your child's attention. I bought this because it was featured at the end of his Word World DVD and he just loved seeing this little rabbit jumping around and started pointing and telling me what stuff was.My son is 2 now and still loves it and it also holds the attention of my older niece's and nephew's as well.
3,Tough subject done well,"Set in rural Oklahoma, a fifteen-year-old boy comes to terms with his prejudice and the deadly consequences of telling lies. Dusty Hamilton is raised by parents who don't overtly descriminate, their brand of discrimination against Native Americans is more insidious and more difficult to eradicate: the silent watchfulness of distrust. Mrs. Hay handles the inner conflict between prejudice and the desire to do the right thing deftly, weaving a well plotted intriguing story. The execution is not as adroit, especially the dream sequences which fail to adequately establish the motivation for some of Dusty's actions in support of Native Americans early in the story, but the subject is understandably difficult to address and Mrs. Hay does a commendable job.Claudia Pearson, GWN Book Reviewer"
3,Great once you figure out how to install it!!!,"Well, I was beginning to get frustrated when I couldn' find a driver or install info anywhere, then decided to come back to Amazon and try to find the info. Luckily someone had had the same problem and let me know there was instructions right on this page... seems quite easy now that I see it :) Pretty good little mouse for the little amount of money once it is working. Not sure how long battery life is but if you only have a few bucks and want a cheap little wireless mouse, this is the one for you."
4,Definitely hooked,"I didn't start watching Private Practice until this year after I did a marathon of Grey's Anatomy and decided I liked Kate Walsh. This show's cast of characters is very likable and the show is well written. Easy and fun watch, can't wait for Season 6."
3,Too much bedroom,"There was way too much jumping into the bed! If my husband and I had children at home now, I would absolutely not let them watch this lewdness!"
4,Great movie...accurate portrayal of Roma,"A good movie and since I just returned from a year in Italy, I can say that this film accurately portrays the style, language, and politics that define Roma. The subtitled translations are not that great, but if you don't speak Italian you would never notice and it doesn't contribute to anything being missed or lost within the plot or anything. I highly recommend this film"
5,THE Coffee Table Book,"Jen Singer's book, 14 Hours 'Till Bedtime is now my new coffee table book. It brings laughs to my guests who discover cheerios stuck to their butts when they get up off of my couch."
2,Kind of Cliched,"I was looking for a book to give to a friend who's a new mom, and this book had a cute cover. But after skimming it in the bookstore, I put it back. Singer's humor is so tiring and cliched already, the same tired and well worn cliches over and over again. And being that she seemingly had time to write this book, then she certainly can't be that overwhelmed by motherhood. Also, I realize that humor is subjective, but I just didn't find Singer to be funny."
2,"Great start, but...","The subjects and ideas in her book are funny, but the writing is inconsistent and repetitive. She contradicts herself many times, which makes the entire experience way less enjoyable. If you read the stories one at a time it's worth it, but don't try to read any of them consecutively because it becomes confusing. If you're looking for a mommy pick-me-up I'd recommend ""Toddler: Real-life Stories of Those Fickle, Irrational, Urgent, Tiny People We Love"" by Jennifer Margulis. Much more real and touching, without the poor writing style of Jen Singer's book."
4,"Good Story, But Kind of Stressful","This is not the kind of book I normally read, but I could stop myself from reading it once I began. Elizabeth Marshall Thomas truly knows how hook a reader. I felt pain and sadness, at the deaths of Yanan's lodge members, but also their joys. The other does a seamless job of moving the story back and forth from the really world [if you can call it that], to the sprit world, and somehow make me [a strong non-fiction reader] believe. I will worn the reader, that this book did not leave me feeling relaxed, I found that I was stressed and restless after reading it. I would call the book a good read, one I wouldn't want to have missed out on, but I wouldn't call it an enjoyable read."
5,Sheer Elegance!,"I was introduced to the Goldberg Variations through Perahia. I then went back to the Gould interpretations which I found to be skillful, but rather heavy and rushed in comparison. Murray Perahia is a poet of the piano."
5,Watch this group,Very cool. Original arrangements and tunes that swing. I expect great things from this group. Watch them. I predict they will go places.
2,Audio mastering is fairly poor.,"I have heard better clarity especially of ""I can help"" his biggest song . This is a budget line cd but anyone listening to it wont become a fan due to the lack lustre audio quality. It could be much better. The equalisation is not right."
1,downhill,"sadly, this is some pretty derivative stuff. granted, it's better than most of what comes out of Nashville, to be sure, but that's not exactly saying much these days. this band hit its peak with the Millican debut album, and the stuff since seems to have gotten weaker. They seem to have lost a lot of their original sound with the departure of their original guitarist, (although jon dee graham was a capable session guitarist on this one).the recording itself is especially murky, enough so to make this a pretty annoying listen. to say it's not a warm disc is a bit of an understatement.in short -- save your money, and instead of buying this one, grab millican, or grab some uncle tupelo/son volt/jay farrar stuff (which seems to have inspired these guys, at least early on)."
1,"Dated, naive view of America.","Disappointing in view of its repute and other Boorstein books. Yes it was written in early '50s ""golden era"" America, but in view of subsequent developments it is naive, lacks perspective and evinces litle knowledge of how real power was wielded in the US from the mid-nineteenth century. Just read about the great railroad strike of 1877 and you can see how much of American history is ignored here.GREAT RAILROAD STRIKE OF 1877: An entry from Gale's Gale Encyclopedia of U.S. Economic HistoryI bought a used copy for about $5.00. Principle value to me was learning how even highly regarded scholars are limited by the biases and preconceptions of their immediately surrounding culture. Not recommended."
5,Great review for great balance,"John Foley's approach to combining brand identity with corporate values and culture is a worthwhile strategy to assimilate into one's company. Everyone is aware that a brand will get a customer 'in the door' but Foley's strategy for identifying key stakeholders and keeping them engaged, is a strategy every company should learn how to employ and practice. I would highly reconmend this book to all who are interested in advancing both the mission and bottom line of their companies. This book would have particular appeal to young people entering the work force as a tool for staying engaged with their comapany's customers."
3,This book was okay,"This book was okay but it had a lot of inaccuarate information the hanson brothers are 17, 14 and 12 For more accurate information i suggest reading Hanson, the official book by Jared Gollihare"
3,From Excellent to So-So,The older version is much better. Too much was cut out of the original. This kind of editing turned a great movie to a so-so movie.
2,Edited edition,I was looking for a new DVD to replace my old VHS tape. I was disappointed in this copy. It has many scenes edited out or shortened. If you have seen it as often as I have (I have shown it to my history classes for the last 10 years or so which means I see it six times a day for ten years) if becomes very easy to spot and hear the edits. I will go somewhere and find an unedited copy of this good film.
5,one of the best,"This single is perhaps not one of her best but however, the mixes of this great song are the best ones I have heard! takk."
3,Read if for the Good Stuff,"I can't disagree with the negative critics of this book. Every time Cook starts his condescending ""jazz critic"" schtick, I cringe. But I loved his research, his chronology -- everything that told me the history of this wonderful record label. I'm glad I have the book in my jazz library."
5,Grand Prize!,"My friend took me to a few Grand Prize concerts and I was reluctant to go, but as a resident of Boise, ID, where Grand Prize is from, I really started to like them. This is an amazing cd!"
3,Hot Babes...but...,"The women in the scenes are quite lovely but the interaction between them is not very exciting. All in all, this could have been better had they hired more daring models, but then again, if this were a perfect world, I would be making these videos myself."
5,"no matter what anyone say, this is a great movie","This movie is really good. It has love, true love, heartbreak and all the elements of a modern day romance and drama. The actors are perfect for their roles and people who didn't like this movie probably don't appreciate many good films."
2,Worst transfer of a film to DVD I have ever seen!!!!!!!!!,"I was really excited to watch this again, had not seen it in at least 15 years, but I could not get through it, the transfer was beyond awful, it was sheer laziness on the part of whoever released this on DVD, I felt like I was watching a bootleg version, bootlegers could have done a better transfer of this film than these idiots!!!!!!The film>>> Good / The DVD Transfer>>>> Horrible!!!!!!!!"
2,AWFUL DVD,"This movie deserves a better DVD than this garbage. What an awful transfer. It looks like they copied it from the original VHS release.How upsetting to wait for this gem of a movie to be released on DVD, only to be treated like a leftover, included in a collection of movies called The Lost Collection that really includes turds like Repossessed, Morgan Stewart's Coming Home and Homer and Eddie that should have been lost and burned back in the 80's."
2,Please read if you are a fan of this movie.,"This was a great movie with an all star cast. The plot was fantastic and it was an excellent ""feel good"" movie. The movie gets five stars and the film transfer to dvd gets zero stars. My rating is two stars. I love this movie so I bought it to have it in my collection. I am keeping it even though it has many dark scenes and blackouts. Keep this in mind and hopefully someday we will get a good print of this film."
3,Not sure what to think.,"The one thing that first got me with Fish was back when I first got ""Fugazi"" when it was released. I was 13 or 14 and the lyrics just grabbed me. The words of Fish were golden. But solo Fish is really starting to disappoint me. The music is o.k. on this but the lyrics are laughable at times (""like being parked on double yellow lines...""). He just isn't able to piant the same pictures in words. I love Fish. I want him to become the poet of old, but I'm losing faith. Musically it is his best. But then again it's not hard to rise above ""Suits"" All in all, it's good, but I know the guy has it in him to do much better. I just hope he gets a little bigger in the states so that his stuff continues to be this easy and cheap to get. It's also about time he released a version of ""Faithhealer"", my live version is getting old."
2,very dissapointing,"after SUNSETS, i thought that fish was back on the right track. man oh man, was i wrong. this album is just proving that he basically has lost it. he has turned into 'sting pt.two', and no longer has any drive in his music. if you would ike to hear that drive, pick up .COM, by marillion"
2,great workout,"it sifts flour, so I'll give it at least 2 stars, but unless you're looking for a good workout, I'd stick with a more traditional model with a full crank.it might not be a deal breaker if you're just looking to sift powdered sugar over a cake, but I'm a 30 year-old guy in decent shape and after just 1 cup of flour, my hand was exhausted. with a full crank, you can have your larger arm muscles do the work, not just your hands."
2,Stick to the Traditional Sifter,"I have a sifter just like this. And in minutes I will be replacing it with an old fashioned style sifter. After wearing my old sifter out several months ago, I purchased one like this thinking it was time to upgrade to a newer style. After using it about 15 times, I am throwing in the towel and switching back to the old model with the crank handle on the outside. There's nothing wrong with the quality of this item, it just sifts much slower even when you operate it quickly. On those rare occasions when you feel the need to clean it, it is very difficult to easily do. This is one of those items whereby newer is not necessarily better."
5,Awaitingthe DVD,"This is less a review and more a comment that I await the release of the DVD on this long-forgotten John Ford film about Dr. Mudd. Let me announce my bias and interest. I am author of the book ""The Union vs. Dr. Mudd,"" originally published in 1964, due to be reprinted by the University Press of Florida in the spring of 2008, well in time for celebrations in 2009 related to the 200th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's birthday. It is fitting and proper that the film has been scheduled for release in a DVD format in advance of the reprint edition of my book. Was Dr. Mudd guilty or innocent in the conspiracy connected with the Lincoln assassination? Historians differ on this fact. You can make up your own mind after seeing the film and later reading the book. I'll place my order with Amazon.com in time for the December 4 release."
5,Great Show,"Please release the show to DVD! I have the ""Best Of"" VHS tape, but do not want to buy a VCR just to watch it. As the other folks mentioned, I would buy the entire set if released. Great, great show."
5,Great Photo Gadget,It's a fabulous little invention - a lens cloth that you attach to the camera strap! Buy it!
3,Micro Fiber Cleaning Cloth,"Compact, easy to carry; however, not worth the price tag they've put on it to me. I would like to see it priced at 3-4 dollars as I can get a cleaning cloth for my glasses for about that price and what's the difference? I used this little cloth though and it did a good job of cleaning the fingerprint off my lens. I didn't have to rub and rub as with some other cloths. Two passes and it was clean. So the little thing works great! I also wished it was not sewn to the inside of the bag as it won't let go of the bag as you clean and who wants a hard plastic piece bouncing around all over their camera equipment. I would like to see this cloth a little bigger to comparable with the price and would like to be able to remove it completely from the bag."
4,"Works well, clever self-packaging, a bit expensive","One corner of the cloth is sewed into the small pouch that protects it when not in use. You pull the cloth out of the pouch, use it, then shove it back in. The clever packaging makes it easy to keep in a camera bag or pocket, while minimizing contamination and making it impossible to lose the protective container while using the cloth. The pouch has a belt hook and with the cloth inside, the pouch is very small.Obviously, you could put any cloth in a plastic bag, but such a bag can tear or get lost.Otherwise, it's like any other micro-fiber cloth: cleans better than the flap of a shirt and is lint-free.The price is a bit high, but the clever packaging is worth a bit extra."
1,Nikon Micro Fiber Cleaning Cloth,"This product is good but it is very small; it is a size of my small palm. On the item description, they make it look 10x bigger and it did not inidcate the size. The picture is misleading and the black pouch only measures 1""h x 1"" w. It's not worth $10."
3,Not actually needed,"It's actually what it says, but I find it as an added weight on my camera (it's very light but kind of distracting). Its useful but not that useful and since I wear glasses I have plenty of microfiber cleaning cloth and I don't have to pay for them. You can live without it, and so can your camera."
4,Good Size,I'm pleased with this spoon rest - big enough for a wide spatula or two other utensils. Nice-looking enough to leave out on the counter. 4 rather than 5 stars because the stainless steel shows water spots out of the dishwasher but this is an aesthetic vs. a functional issue.
3,Like the size but not the loop,"This spoon rest is BIG compared to most, you can easily rest two spoons on it, which is nice. I initially loved it and was going to order one for the other side of my stove, but the loop on the end is very annoying. It catches on our wire drying rack every time we wash it, and will hook onto things that are pushed up against it on the counter. A different end would make this perfect. It's held up well in the dishwasher, etc, too."
5,Very well-made item!!!,"If you're someone who rests your spatulas or pancake flipper or stirring spoons on a paper plate or a paper towel or a regular plate, it's time to buy a quality spoon/spatula rest for your stovetop. This spoon rest is a well-made hefty utensil, definitely not a stamped piece of metal. It's stainless steel so it's modern and matches everything. This gets an AAA+++ from me!!"
3,It is ok .,"It is ok but dont expect it hold it long for you :) .....it's all about how "" YOU "" learn to use control your muscle?"
3,Gift,Not sure if it is the exact one the person I'm giving it to wants. About 85% sure he'll like it either way.
1,chump,"Who does this guy think he is, Jaco? When I was recruiting a bass player for my band in Corpus Cristi, I thought that town had some balls. Apres Rudy, however, the bloodline has run thin. These guys have more in common with Al Dimeola than Warren Dimartini. If you like to pretend that you're a rock'n roller, but you're really just a geek that got beat up until you were 15, this album is for you. This album shows why people still go to see old farts playing real rock, because all the new talent can't hack it. Holford, you'll never get to play the stadiums with this crap- get a haircut!"
2,a let-down for Zippers fans,"After buying and loving ""Perennial Favorites"" and ""Hot"" I was really excited to hear that the Squirrel Nut Zippers recorded a Christmas album. Well, the ""Christmas caravan"" turned out to be a real let-down. The album is not all bad, the Zippers are too good a band for that, but it isn't great either. It comes along as something that was slapped together too fast. With ""Perennial Favorites"" and especially with ""Hot"" they have gotten us used to outstanding quality, albums that have matured and where every single song is great. This one is just OK and doesn't stand out for anything. A very mediocre effort from an otherwise so talented and creative gang."
5,Best Christmas CD in a long time!,"I got the CD from a Radio Station Promotion, and Its awesome. The tracks really bring a swingin side to chirstmas."
2,Hoped for so much more,"This is my first Zippers CD. I thought it would be a good introduction to their style. Sadly, the only track that met my expectations was the New Orleans sounding instrumental of ""Sleigh Ride"". ""Hot Christmas"" had potential but just seems uninspired. In fact that's the one word I'd use to describe this CD - uninspired. It seems as if they weren't interested in making it in the first place. If you need an escape from the traditional christmas songs I suggest the FAR superior ""HO HO HO"" by RuPaul also available on amazon.con."
4,MARTINA HAS THE SWEET SMELL OF ROSES!,"I am a Martina fan and have been for a while. I knew that she was doing remakes of older Country songs. I wasn't sure what to think and actually took the chance that it would be GREAT. Like a few other people, it took a few listens to it to realize that I LOVE it! I think for the more contemporary country music enthusiasts it does take time because we are not accustom to the more genuine classic country songs. Even though I've never heard the originals of these songs, I still like them very much!I believe this is an album that you need to listen to, to truely enjoy this CD. If you liked Joe Nichols' music, you'll probably like this CD.It's deffinately worth the money, and something any country music fan should not pass up!"
3,"Excited, but a little disappointed","I was very happy to come across this video, as it is very hard to find videos of Odo Sensei doing kata, let alone the entire system. I am very glad that this dvd was put together as a wonderful tribute to a fantastic individual. I had many opportunities to train with Odo Sensei during my ten years in Hawai'i. The only thing that disappointed me was that it was made from a video someone made for themself of Odo Sensei doing kata both inside and outside his dojo in Agena, Okinawa sometime in the mid to late 80s. I have seen this video several times from a copy my instructor owned. Overall I am very excited for the future generations of Okinawa Kenpo (or as it is currently called Ryukyu Hon Kenpo Kobudo) students to be able to watch Odo Sensei performing kata and kobudo."
4,IKKF Karate-ke take note,"The video quality is from the VHS days, but the kata are exactly what every IKKF practitioner needs. There is nothing like seeing all of your kata performed by Odo Sensei himself!"
1,Oh what a dissapointment!,"I purchased First edge last year right after I bought my new I Mac. Love my Mac hate this software program! I agree with the other reviewers, no tech support whatsoever! I had use Quickbboks on my old PC but never could figure this thing out so I returned it! I wonder how much business MYOB has lost due to the no tech support rule. They could use a crash course in customer service. Will never purchase any products from this company again unless they change their policies!Marcus Allison"
3,Can't do reports in current year??????,"I have used this product for 3 years now and it has been great for me. I just need simple accounting software. Today I have found a major problem. I want to print a profit and Loss statement for this year, 2007. For some reason in reports it won't change the year to the current one and won't let you do it either. What do I do? Buy the new version or change software? I'm frustrated with this software right now."
5,Cheap HD For Your 360,"If you have an LCD monitor for your PC, but don't have an HDTV, this is a fantastic way to experience your 360 in HD. Connect the VGA to your LCD, and the audio to whatever you please, set the resolution in the 360 dashboard, and enjoy! I had absolutely no problems in getting this up and running, and the only complaint I have about it is that the audio cables spawn at the VGA plug instead of at the 360 end of the cable, so you may need to buy some RCA extensions."
2,Poorly made cables,"These have no optical audio plug so if you have a surround sound set don't plan on getting dolby digital out of these cables. Also the picture quality is low because it shows fuzzy white outlines around everything making the image seem blurry. Overall these are poorly made, do yourself a favor and just get the first party cables for $20 more."
1,wish i'd checked here first,"grabbed it on the way out, total piece of crap, no digital audio, DO NOT BUY THIS. i wish you could rank less than 1 star."
4,So glad I bought it.,This is the first of Ms. Smith's books I have read and I loved it. She does a wonderful job guiding the reader through Grace's life and the characters she meets along the way.
5,Thought-provoking!,"Just finished reading this book and I loved it! It expands on the ""Law of Attraction."" As a result of reading it, I've been considering a number of new perspectives on attracting health, abundance, or whatever happens to be ""up.""I was particularly taken with the Law of Resistance and am exploring the connection between health and resistance in the form of healthy lifestyle practices on my Healthy Living DIY blog. For example, a person who prioritizes ""doing even more stuff"" over ""getting enough sleep to be well-rested"" is by that choice resisting health.Very interesting!"
1,Awful editing,"While this book is just another treatise on a form of metaphysics, the editing is just awful! Mispelled words, wrong words...you have to be very careful reading it & do your own interpretation in some instances to determine what the actual word in the sentence was intended to be. Anyone who studies this subject would do well to spend their money on other works. This one has some merit but won't tell you anything you probably don't already know...and the poor attention to proper & correct printing makes it even less desirable...this one is not a good investment of your time or money."
1,Another copy protection nightmare!!,"Whatever happened to an artist releasing an extensive catalogue of albums before releasing a ""very best"" set? Stone has only THREE albums, and she hasn't been around the block long enough to come up with a greatest hits album. But what really pissed me off is that this copy-protected CD comes with a VERY malicious form of spyware call ROOTKIT which cannot be removed and makes your PC a slave to Sony. Do you want Sony spying on you to find out what you're listening to, when, and how often? Then do not, repeat-DO NOT, buy this infected CD. You'll be sorry."
1,Cuidado con esta version!,"Averiguen bien la historia de la Biblia Reina-Valera antes de comprar esta edicion.La edicion de 1865 introdujo MUCHISIMOS cambios al trabajo original de Casiodoro de Reina y Cipriano de Valera, utilizando los recientemente descubiertos manuscritos Vaticanus y Sinaiticus, que muchos autores consideran corruptos.La version 1909 fue hecha especialmente para quitar esos cambios, y devolverle a la Reina-Valera la pureza de las versiones antiguas.Asi que no se deje engañar. Parece que hoy en dia, disfrazandola tras una supuesta ""edicion 150 aniversario"", alguien quiere popularizar nuevamente las corrupciones del texto que fueron dejadas de lado en 1909."
4,Good story.,"Interesting and entertaining story that covers a lot of territory. The book description provided is a good summary of the first part of this story, which you will like and which sets the stage for the next two phases, which you will like just as much or more. The second phase is mostly about the protagonist's development as a boxer and contains plenty of detail about that process. The third phase blends the protagonist's boxing career with a friendship with a Chinese boxing master and leads to a rousing conclusion involving racial tensions in the early railroad construction days."
5,outstanding,"This is the best, by far, of 3 books I have purchased on automotive painting. It is very current and well written. The book details multiple examples of painting scenarios from touch-ups to frame-off paint jobs. There are numerous examples of cars painted by the author and others in their own garages, just like most poor car junkies would do. Great examples of equipment, paint products, proper use, safety concerns, etc. He really leaves no doubts as to what you need to know in order to pull off your paint project. I have a car torn down to paint and as I do it, this is the book that will be my guide."
4,"Decent, but not Boynton's best","It's little wonder these seven shorts got crammed into one title, since none is really strong enough to stand on its own. As a collection, Bob is cute enough to keep around as an annual treat with the Christmas books (despite other reviewers' thoughts, I like the lullaby at the end). While less endearing or clever than... well, pretty much every other Boynton book, it's still better than many other kids' Christmas books."
4,Notes from the Underground,"So we can't all make music like the Velvet Underground but mud pies are an art form achievable by virtually every humanoid life form. Of course there's a certain ammount of finesse that comes only with time and practice, but Cage's meticulous instructions exist as a solid framework for beginners in this sublime craft. The illustrations are just the sort of inspiration an amateur mud pie or cake maker needs to get those creative juices flowing."
4,"hollywood fats ""rock this house""","I just resently heard this played on the local (St.Louis) blues station. I did not know anything of Hollywood Fats or for that matter hear anything buy him. I could not wait for the DJ to take a break so that he would mention what artist he was playing. Not only did he say it was Hollywood Fats he also gave some insight into this man. He has been around, played with all the big names in the blues. And this recording has some really good musicians. Unfortunately Fats is no longer with us. But his music lives. This recording is a must have for all blues lovers."
3,Enjoyable read,"This is a nicely written account of two people quitting their jobs and traveling accross the country and into Canada and Alaska. This is not a book to use as a reference source for full-timing in your RV, but it did have a few tips and is an enjoyable book to read."
4,great outlook on life,"This womans style of writing was highly attractive for me, I felt like I was sitting right there while she was telling her story. Very descriptive, laugh out loud funny through most of it. But what I really liked was her outlook on life, which really got me thinking about my own. When a book does that for me, well that's what reading a book is all about for me! What more can I say other than I really enjoyed this one!"
5,Humorous Love Story,"It's not often that you find a romance novel that makes you both smile and laugh as you remember similar situations in your own love life. Deb's fear of trusting again and need to believe that Mario had changed his cheating ways really hit close to home. The reference to Mario's wife ""taking off her shoe"" had many members of my book club in tears from laughing. Many shared stories of ""taking off their shoe"" or witnessing a friend do the same. I enjoyed the references to some of our local Chicago sites.I really enjoyed the story and look forward to more books from Ms. Keaton."
3,Unique film,"It's an strange movie. Wendy is a small gun. The main character Dick brought it for a birthday gift for a peer but decides to keep it. Later, he finds out it's a real gun by a co-worker and together get into shooting guns. Then they form a club with the other young people like themselves, timid and introverted. They call themselves the Dandies. All of them see themselves non-violent but get confidence from their guns. The Dandies relate to their guns as if they had a soul or personality. As you can guess, this movie doesn't have a happy ending.If you are looking for something different, you might like this. It will get you pondering about America's relationship with guns and the culture around it. There was something about this film that got me thinking about the Columbine killers."
4,Images Of Umbria,"As the copy on the back cover says, this is not your average travel video. The DVD is actually seven short films - each with a different theme - but all are set to images and music. There is not a single word of dialogue throughout the entire 60+ minutes, and that makes for a very serene and interesting experience. This is a perfect video for viewing after a long day of work or if you are feeling stressed out, whether or not you have a particular affinity for Italy.This DVD is not a tourist guide in the common sense of the word, but there is something about the way the films are made that makes you want to visit Umbria. As the DVD cover states, it's a calming escape to a beautiful place. It's for travelers, explorers, wanderers, discoverers."
4,a true tastemaker from a true artist,"wow, i just got this today for christmas and i am very very pleased. i had just recently discovered afromystik (dj fluid's band) and quickly started digging their stuff. when i heard he had a mix album out, i new it would definitely be good. with the recent rise in popularity of latin/afro/brazilian rhythms, fluid showcases a nice variety of all. the funk mixed with the jazz, the samba with the hop, and the fun with the entire album. fans of compost (jazzanova, truby trio, beanfield) and ubiquity need to peep this comp."
4,Good Goth Metal,"I was a little disappointed in this album. My first Tristania purchase was ""Illumination"" and I consider that a much better album. The female vocal is mostly buried on these songs and there are too many death grunts.I like female vocalists which you get a beautiful and strong dose of on ""Illumination."" I still give this album 4 stars for being strong in its genre. The use of an orchestration sound and complex arrangements make it a good listen. It has a dark angry steel feel to it, so I would be wary if you're not a strong goth metal fan. If this is your genre, then I would say this is a smart choice."
3,Historical/trivia reference,"This book gives lots of background history and trivia and is interesting in that sense, butI was hoping for more DIY-type information source. There are precious few pages that discuss methods.It is printed in a small b/w format so it's not that valuable for coffee table type that you can read and see beautiful pictures, yet they are interesting in a museum sort of way. The price seems a bit high for what it offers."
4,cool book,Cool Book to give you some crazy ideas but if your looking for a step by step guide to arborsculpture this is not the best book.
2,network diagram with triangles and lines is very annoying,"This book is either loved or hated depending on one's background experience in Cisco routers. All the reviewers are correct in their assessment. There are mistakes, no question about that. The CD that comes with the book is also full of errors - another sign of ""rushing it out the door"". Despite all that, I don't find it to be terribly bad. The certification summary, the two-minute drill, the number of questions at the end of the chapter etc. are helpful. However, there is one thing that really annoys me and I am not sure if you will agree. The network diagrams in the book looks really odd with those funny looking triangles. Just for that, I have to downgrade it from 3 stars to 2 stars. The publisher should seriously look for another artist who knows how to draw a network diagram in a clear and concise manner."
1,I thought this book was terrible.,"I read this book twice and when taking the test at the end of each chapter I was getting 95% or better. I noticed there where a lot of key information missing, after I failed the test. There were quite a few things on the test that weren't covered in the book. I got quite a bit of information from this book, but the purpose of the book was to help in passing the test. I wouldn't refer this book to no one."
2,Fair Book - Horrible CDROM,"This book is fair, but has many incorrect statements. The CDROM included is Horrible. To start with there are spelling errors - unacceptable in today's wordprocessor environment. The web interface is nearly unusable. The questions have incorrect statements/answers. I was hoping for an upgraded/better version, but McGrall-Hill (publisher) says one is not available."
2,You won't pass the test if this is your only study material.,"I can see why the book is selling for 30% off - it is full of errors. For someone with Cisco experience, the mistakes are easy to pick-out. As much as 40% of the book is not directly applicable to the CCNA test, but I did get $35 of use out of it. I found the textbook from the actual ICRC class a better reference for test preparation. You won't pass the CCNA test if you have no Cisco experience and this is your only reference guide. Yes, I did pass the CCNA test today on the first try."
5,Keep this by your side,"If you think CCNA makes Cisco certification easy you're dead wrong. I've worked on CAT 5s for three years, and thought I knew what I needed. But stuff like grouping switch ports to sequential cards needs a lot of review. I though this was very well done."
1,Way too many errors to count,"Talk about getting confused. I doubt you can pass the test using this book, I didn't. The questions are worthless and there are too many errors."
1,A brief idea,This book doesn't explain things. It is a big index. Software that comes with this book is crumsy at best.
2,Only Fair at Best,This book fell short on real hands on examples. Some of the test questions on the CD are wrong. Over all I was very disappointed.
1,Not a good choice.,This book is poorly arranged and confusing. It is full of typographical errors and in several cases the material is simply incorrect. I felt that the authors rushed this book to press without thoroughly reviewing it.I would be surprised if anyone without prior experience in this subject could pass this test based on this book.There are several other texts for this test that are much more accurate and of much better quality.
1,outdated!!!!,This book is not even close to the depth that the CCNA requires. The CCNA questions are more situational than this book leads you to believe. Do not rely on this book for any more than a stepping stone up to the Cisco Inro to Cisco Router Configuration (Cisco Press)book.
1,Where's the information?,"If you're looking for a book to skim the details and lightly touch on a hundred different topics per chapter, get this book. Otherwise, keep away. It presents the information so rapidly and assumes that you are already familiar with all the acronyms and terminology that you almost have to be a CCIE to understand it. I'm not the best with network terminology and thought this book would help to bring me up to speed on current terminology and information, but boy was I mistaken. It does have some information, but touches too lightly on it to be absorbed. I guess we'll just have to wait for Que or Sams to come out with a semi-decent book...."
3,It not right but it's o.k.,"After studying the book I almost passed the CCNA test the first time. The following week I studied the Cisco ICRC course material and passed with 80%. So although there are errors in the book, it a good pick up study guide, but don't use it alone. So to follow Whitney Houston, it not right, but it's an o.k. book. Suc6 on the persuit."
1,This book does not contain all the necessary information,"I barely passed my CCNA exam using this book as one of my primary sources of study. If I had not been using the CBTs and reading extra info on the Cisco web page, I would not have passed. This book is serverely lacking in areas such as ISDN, encapsulation and switching. Many of the exam objectives (the current ones in pdf format from Cisco) are completely ignored. Also, if you are looking for hands-on laboratories, you will not find any in this book."
3,Buy the Cisco manuals,"I'm sorry to say that I bought my copy of this book from a local bookstore -- without first reading the reviews here. I failed the CCNA test on my first try with only a 64% score. I studied my brains out and managed only a 72% on my second try.There are a number of areas on the test that are not covered in this book. Most memorable to me are the questions I received about ""message of the day."" Most other topics were presented, but not in enough depth to truly understand the answers.I attempted to take this test without any hands-on experience and would not have been able to pass at all, based upon this study guide. I got my hands on a 1601 for experimentation and managed to make it through my second try."
2,Don't soley rely on this book to pass the CCNA test!,This book should be used as a supplement only. Don't let the questions at the end of each chapter lull you into a false sense of security. The actual CCNA test questions are much more comprehensive and difficult.
4,Jason Carter - Evocativa,"""An album of music, not just for the serious-minded, that offers melodic sounds from the four corners of the world."""
5,Great Reading,"I happen to have known the O'Bara family since I was in kindergarten... I went to school with Edwarda for eight years and knew her mother as my teacher. Dr. Dyer did a great job showing the devotion and care of Kaye with Edwarda. Whether one agrees with her decision or not, you will have to admire her courage, tenacity, and devotion to her children."
5,Best christmas Album ever made Period.,"Don't challenge me on this cd,iam an audiophile of the highest order.I have over 50 christmas cds in my collection,this cd is at the top of the list.I have never heard a voice this perfect,an arrangement this superb,and cd this well produced.Buy it if you dare,however,you will not find any i have bought all of them i hope."
4,WORTH THE WAIT!,I too have been waiting for years for this to be released again. Every year WDAS plays My Gift To You & Remember Why at christmas time. When I found out who sang these songs I was disappointed that I could not order the CD. Now that I have it I will be playing it every year. There's a couple songs I don't like as much but the album overall it pretty good. Remember Why is definitely my favorite christmas song of all time. It tells of the REAL meaning of Christmas-the birth of Jesus & not Santa!
3,"Good writing, but too vague","This book is fairly well-written, but ultimately, it's frustrating because it doesn't tell the reader how to deal with specific search engine ad programs. Instead, Catherine Seda talks about categories of search engine advertising like ""Fixed Placement,"" ""Pay for Placement,"" ""Submit URL,"" and ""Trusted Feed."" I keep reading these categories and wondering, ""Is the model she's referring to here like Google? If so, how is Google different? How do all these programs rate for popularity, bang for the buck, etc.?"" I guess Ms. Seda avoided these specifics so that her book didn't look outdated too quickly. I'd rather have a book that was extremely valuable at one point than one that tries to dance around the specific facts I'm craving."
1,The next big thing - NOT,"Received the CD yesterday from one who felt these guys were the next big thing ... politely disagree.From song one I was predicting the riffs and the music was like Weezer meets Oasis. This is not the next big thing. My advice to these guys ... spend some more time resting on your garage band king status with your punk rock princess (as stated by the predictable cliche lyrics in track 3). On a positive note, it was worth the price (...)"
4,Childrens Cross Pendant,"Nice pendant for kids, the description of this item should specify the size of the pendant since its very small. I would recommend it to anyone."
5,A well Crafted and Inspiring Story,"Ms. Williams makes a geat debut with this page-turner that holds her readers' interest from beginning to end.She demonstrates how her main character, an Olympic equestrian hopeful, pulls himself out of the depths of despair.With faith, love and the trust of a small autistic boy, Randy overcomes his depression and self-pity, falls in love with the boy's mother and eventually regains some use of his body.He uses his talents and knowledge of horses to change the lives of physically disabled children by creating a training camp on his ranch for disabled children.The equestrian information as well as the display of a greater power is an added plus for the reader."

4,Featuring Dr. John,"I had this album on tape and now I have it on CD. It has a nice version of ""It's All Over Now"" with Dr. John on vocals. This is a song the Stones covered back in the '60s. It was written by Bobby Womack. I have seen the Dirty Dozen in concert too. This is the album that best represents the group, I think."
3,Comedic farce offering a glimpse of life in Cuba,"Outrageously funny, subtitles do not do justice to the rapid fire exchanges, subtle nuances and ""inside"" barbs that sometimes even native Cubans need help in understanding. Not for the easily offended."
2,Larry Eckstein,Ordered 2 Liftmaster 81 LM garage door remotes. Neither would work when I received them. Trouble shooting revealed they both had dead batteries. It took me a couple days to figure this out. At first I thought I was trying to program them wrong. I wan't. Defective product. After I replaced the batteries they both worked fine.
3,OK,Product works as advertised but not as solid made as the original remote that came with my garage door opener. Fast delivery though.
2,"Works, after clicking it furiously",This is a crap product. It usually takes me about ten tries before it works and I have to drive as close as I can possibly get to my garage door in order for it to work. I bought it to replace another older remote of the same brand and it fails just as hard. Do yourself a favor and purchase another brand. It works but just barely.
4,Satisfied. Delivery as promised. Remote worked,"The remote control delivered on or before promised date. Followed the included instructions to ""sync up"" with my existing garage door opener. Now both my kids who have cars can open the garage door with ease."
5,Does as promoted. MAKE SURE YOU CHECK WHICH ONE YOU NEED.,I bought this as a remote for my car since I just leased a house with a 2 car garage with some friends. The owner/retailer handed us one remote and I let my roommate take that one while I went on the search for one. I checked the motor for the garage and it was a Liftmaster with a green sync button. Bought this when I found it was compatible with green sync button Liftmasters. It came with instructions how to sync it and within 3 minutes of opening the box we had 2 garage openers for our garage. Very pleased.
5,Works great,"I was needing another garage door remote control for my liftmaster garage door opener and found this one. I wasn't sure whether it would work, but it looked like it would according to my manual. It works great and has a nice, big button. It was easy to program and is easy to use."
5,Best Remote For Older Doors That Are Compatible,"Good range, about 50' in my application. Easy to program. I had bought a KLIK1U universal remote, but the range was awful. This one works quite nicely."
1,overrated,"I read the first story and did not feel like reading any more. Writing is decent, but be forwarned it is (unnecessarily) gory (broken neck and bones sticking out)"
1,Positive reviews here are a sad commentary on our world.,"Like one of the reveiwers here....I read the first story, and was so disturbed by the, cruelty that I almost put the book down. But I didn't...yet I wish I had. I give this author an A for style and prose, but a big F for heart and soul. It is horrifying to me that so many of you think that this book is so earthshatteringly good. It's a sad reflection on the lack of humanity today, in ourselves as a people. The author's cruel writing makes me feel that she could actually be capable of such cruelty. And most of you are eating it up.....shame."
5,Same album with lower price,This same album sells for $8.99 on this site. One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven.just trying to let you know that you have 2 release dates for this intem with different prices.
3,Tracklisting,Swedish act on North of No South Records1. Let's Step Aside2. Frosted Minds3. It's Golden4. I'm Not Myself5. Open Those Eyes6. Say Oh Say7. Three-Minute Convert8. Don't Remind Me9. She's So Ready10. Preacher/Songwriter11. Naked Natives
1,Comparison,"Ok. First their name is far from original. Secondly, what has music come to? Everything has become another Linkin Park. Someone told me that they sounded like the Deftones. NEWS FLASH!! Deftones are talented original musiscians, and Finch are unoriginal children with no taste for what's good in music. I feel sorry for the world of music to have to deal with such distaste. I do NOT reccommend spending your valuable dollars on this band, though if you do, beware."
2,Don't waste your time,"This album is a dude in the fact that there are way too many ""skits"" in between every song and the songs themselves aren't very interesting. They have decent voices but it was not worth the wait to receive this dud in the mail. I wouldn't expect a sophomore effort."
4,"An amazing historical document, bearing repeated listening","If you ever want to hear the real brilliance of Bird, check out the way he ""thinks"" his way through the bridge of Four Brothers the first time 'round, cautiously pawing at the changes. Next time the bridge comes up, Bird has internalized that bridge and sounds like he's played it his whole life! Otherwise, this album is a very pleasant listening experience. Don't be put off by the unlikely pairing: these two artists had enormous respect for each other. And it shows."
4,"Read this book! ... Make that, Read This Series!",This book is just one of the many stories that has made this woman such a best-seller. All of her books the reader will enjoy getting cozy with.
1,Scuttle this Trike,"Anything coming out of a box at Christmastime is exciting to our toddler. Most toys, though, hold an excitement for him. This trike lost his interest after one try. Scuttle the trike I say, or let it become unmoved furniture in your home."
4,Welcome to Paradise,"It's interesting to see what Wright has done with this long-awaited third installment in his Dantesque trilogy. NEGATIVE BLUE is subtitled SELECTED LATER POEMS, but in fact it includes nearly everything from the last three books. There are a handful of poems excluded from CHICKAMAUGA, BLACK ZODIAC is reprinted complete, and only one poem is excluded from APPALACHIA. Also, there is a fine (and sometimes funny) concluding sequence of new poems, ""North American Bear,"" which cements the book's relationship to the Paradiso.Wright can sometimes drift into opacity, but on the whole these are fascinating poems about his three favorite subjects: language, landscape, and the idea of God."
4,Good stuff,"The cherry variety WITHOUT the ""sparkles"" is better....like my review of the grape variety...this candy reminds me of my childhood....I love this taffy still....just don't like the ""sparkles"" in them"
4,A nice gift,"This is a great gift for a male. I had ordered it for my granddaughter but it was a little too masculine. I really liked it. The adjustable rope was great for all ages. Even though I am returning it, it is a nice gift for all those male singers as a reminder of their passion."
1,No room for advancement,"I have been some what experienced with pilates since 16. This book is terrible. It leaves no room for advancement, especially if you prefer ""traditional"" pilates. Plus, mixing advanced moves with basic moves. No. Try the Complete Idiot's Guide to the Pilates Method, The Powerhouse, The Pilates Body."
4,A very good reference book for parents,"Wouldn't it be wonderful if a child is motivated and is willing and wanting to learn by himself, just because he WANTS to?This book has given me so many ideas.Parents who really want to put more effort in helping their children should read this book."
2,A book of lists,"I was not impressed with this book. It's a book of lists, and checklists, not a narrative, descriptive guide to how to coach. It has a bunch of forms, which are great if you're just launching your practice, but to really learn the craft, this is not the book to teach that. It's ""oversell"" to say that it's ""everything you need to launch"" or even expand your practice. This book disappointed me greatly."
4,The Coaching Starter Kit by Coachville.com,"My goal was to obtain a variety of forms, which could be used or modified for a coaching practice. This book provides this plus a considerable amount of information about the coaching business. This book is a good starting point for anyone considering the coaching business."
5,Insider's view: How The First Biotech Tomato Flopped,"First Fruit provides an interesting, quick read of a Califonia company's effort to develop and sell the Flavr Savr tomato - the first gentically engineered, but not the last, whole food. Written by a Flavr Savr researcher, the book highlights the internal clash between business executives seeking immediate financial returns and scientists charged with coming up with a high-tech tomato that genetic science had not yet produced for general salad consumption. The book's middle-third is a little too technical if you never managed better than a C+ in chemisty or biology, but the insider's view of the struggle to get the new tomato to market and her responsible conclusions make this book a must read for anyone interested in the emerging global role of biotechnology."
5,I wish I'd taped each episode,"I can't wait for this to come out on DVD. I really enjoyed all the characters and was ""proud"" to have black cartoon family that was positive and funny."
3,The Proud Family Movie,"On December 6th, a day already plentiful with Disney DVDs, the studio will also issue a pair of new Disney Channel discs with urban appeal. The recently-aired feature-length finale The Proud Family Movie and new 100-minute episode compilation ""That's So Raven"": Raven's House Party will each be released with $19.99 SRPs. Cover art has been added At Ultimate Disney."
1,dont by used books from amazon they LIE!!!!!!b --.--,This book was missing pages and it missed led me to think it was going to come with all three CDs I wasStrongly DISAPOITED in Amazon and the Lies they had me believing ........ -.-
1,Be careful of a big mistake!,"Though you may think this is the audio version of the book, this is not!Really, it is the first edition of the music cds accompanying the book.You would like to know that these 35 tune cds have an overlapping of 50% with the 2nd edition cds. I've rated this item with one star only because its misleading display, not becase of its real content.Jazz: The First 100 Years"
2,Buyer Beware.,"I know for some of you the sheer excitement of getting 2 disks of an old favorite tv show at such an amazing price is just too good to be true, isn't it? Well apparently, it is. If the 2006 in parenthesis didn't clue you in these 'Freaky Favorites' are picked from AYAOTD's Season 6, which was was the new cast after it's initial run was cancelled.So like the other reviewer has stated, if you want the original cast and tales, goto amazon.ca and order it from amazon's canadian retailer. And write to Nick and tell them to release these classics in America, otherwise we're just going to keep giving those canucks our American money."
1,"A cheap Season 6 ""best of"" set.","This is not the Are you Afraid of the Dark set you've been waiting for.This is a merely a ""best of"" set from Season 6, episodes that debuted back in 1999-2000, when Nick decided to being back Are you Afraid of the Dark for another season.None of these episodes are as good as the classics from the series original run which debuted in '92. Which featured such memorable episodes as ""The Hatching"" ""The Shiny Red Bicycle"" ""The Final Wish"" and others.Avoid this. You can buy the complete First Season of Are you Afraid of the Dark? on Amazon.ca. (It is Region 1, so it will work on US DVD Players) There's a few lame episodes on that set, but it's better than this set becuase it contains the original episodes from when the series first began way back when.Pwersonally, I'm waiting for Season 2 to be released. That is when the series really hit its peak with some excellent episodes."
4,Cooking Indian by Numbers,"In Indian cooking there is such a collection of spices and herbs. This book breaks the grouping of ingredients into ""Bowls."" Bowl 1, Bowl 2, Bowl 3, etc. Makes it very easy to prep ahead of time. And, the results have, so far, been delicious. Especially the Chicken Vindaloo!!! Fantastic! Wish I'd doubled the recipe so that we'd have leftovers."
4,Works as Advertised,"The remote interfaced easily with my garage door opener, taking only about a minute to unpack, read the simple instructions, and have working. I am very pleased."
5,Love this garage door opener!,The garage door opener was delivered promptly. It was super easy to set to my garage door. It has over a billion codes so no one can drive by and open my garage door with a differnt opener. The battery still works.
4,Garage Door Opener,Received it and it works just as easily as noted in the other comments after a couple of quick steps. Thanks.
5,Great garage door opener!,"After two months of getting in and out of my car to manually open the garage , I found these online . I bought them , they were delivered quickly and worked right away ! I jumped for joy !! Buy this opener ! Be sure to check the model number."
1,Doesn't work,I've tried to program the remote multiple times with the help of my father in law who is a mechanic.
5,liftmaster 971LM,The garage remote took less than 2 minutes to sync with the garage learn button. Just make sure you read the instructions that come with the remote and you will do fine.
1,"This item is either overpriced, or more likely mispriced","DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT FROM THIS SELLER! It is either overpriced or more likely, mispriced.Other sellers have the same unit for $14.99 Even the LiftMaster's website charges only $34.95."
5,Great Replacement,Works from down the block 5 houses away! Love it. Its a big button so its easy to hit too. I remove it from my car if I leave it in the driveway so no one will steal it or open my garage door. Easy to program and use. Reliable too!
5,works great,easy to program and works great...just remember to reprogram all your remotes at once as once I programmed this one it seemed to reset the one that was already programmed.
5,CHeap and works great,"No complaints- works great and was inexpensive, much less than buying on the Liftmaster website and it came in a weeks time"
1,"Can you say ""Homemade"" in es- pan- ol?","We were hoping to augment our children's exposure to spanish with this DVD. However, it failed to hold our children's interest and only held ours in disbelief. The pronunciation of the words is forced and very 'American'. The production value is very low- it looks as if someone learned Windows Movie Maker and made home-videos for the segments.On those notes, if anyone is looking for a used copy...."
4,Good but buy elsewhere!,This stuff is not worth $39.99! I did a quick google search and found it from several teaching supply stores for $5.99! Don't waste your money here.
5,Great!!,Great product. It goes on really easy and the bubbles just go away with using your palm. It looks really great. I haven't tried chalk on it yet but I'm eager to do so
4,Looks great and Works well,"While, I think that installing a painted chalkboard is much easier, i like the fact that you can remove this without much effort. I put it on my fridge and it added some flair to the old thing. The chalk whipes off clean and is easy to write on! I recommend it!"
3,Chalk board paper,It was very hard to write on; had to outline the words several times in order to make it show on the paper.
1,Chalkboard Contact Paper,"Although I love Amazon and thoroughly happy with the service, I was disappointed in the Chalkboard contact paper. I thought it would be more like a chalkboard finish where you could write on it with chalk. The finish was too smooth and when you wrote on it, the chalk wouldn't adhere to the surface."
3,Great idea,Great idea - regular chalk didn't work very good - I would use a white marker pen or maybe there is a different chalk
4,Perfect for my project,The paper shipped fast and is as described. It has been working great. The only thing that isn't perfect is that when I tried to wipe off the chalk marker from it it doesn't all come off. Great for single use though.
5,Perfect for tweeners,"Got this for my daughter instead of wanting to paint a whole wall with chalkboard paint. A cheaper way to get a similar effect. My daughter loves having friends over and drawing all over her ""chalkboard""."
5,"Fun, cheap, works!",Great innovative idea! Multiple uses. Works just like a chalkboard so it must 'cured' to be used. A fantastic tool for the classroom . Works best on smooth surfaces. I highly recommend!
3,okay,was okay. not very good for prolonged use. wasn't easy getting backing off either. for the use of smaller area.
4,Just what I was looking for!,"I wanted a chalkboard surface for my dresser that was easy to apply and worked well. This contact paper was just what I was looking for - the guidelines on the back were helpful for cutting the right size, and I was able to apply it without any bubbles. It did take about 10-15 minutes to get it perfect and to smooth it out. Then I prepped it with a coat of chalk and whipped it down and started writing. I haven't been disappointed yet. It does take a little pressure from the eraser to remove the chalk, but it does erase well. Overall, I would recommend this product and I'm planning on putting it on some more surfaces."
5,Just what I needed,This storage bin was just what I was looking for. It was easy to assemble and fits perfectly into a small space on my desk. Perfect for storing my chair covers and outdoor pillows when not in use. No issues with it so far.
3,Not Rod Sterling standards,"This movie has 3 stories which could have been very good. Unfortunately they were not, and I hate to be the one acting like a wet blanket. The excellent quality of Rod Sterling's works like Night Gallery and Twilight Zone is why I wanted to see and have this movie. I was deeply disappointed because the movies was like a low budget film with bad lighting and stiff acting, terrible camera angles and sound. I was waiting for this to come out on DVD and only had the option of VHS so I bought it. This should stay on the VHS shelf. Highly disappointed."
1,No digital audio,"Digital audio does not work, video does. I gave it one star because it has a completely broken feature. Unacceptable!"
5,Great insight on a great film.,"This book is really awesome. It has the script for each story in the movie, great behind the scenes pictures, cast and film makers thoughts on the project, all of the different posters they put out to promote the movie, and just a bunch of great stuff. This book is definitely well worth the money, I spent $30 on it at Borders, so I suggest you buy it from here for such a great bargain."
3,Problem with the DVD,"I wasn't that crazy about the movie itself, but obviously it's got quite the fan base. Never mind about that, though.The DVD is terrific in most every respect, but I thought this was worth noting: the English subtitles here match the English language audio track, and not the French one. By that, I mean that subtitles appear for lines that were only added during the English dub, as well as lines that were moved slightly around during the dubbing process. Lines that were in the French version, but not the English, don't get subtitles at all.The result: if you watch it in French with English subtitles, subtitles will appear when no one is speaking, and some spoken lines aren't translated. Whoops!Then again, there's very little dialogue, and the conversations aren't the most complicated I've ever seen."
3,Well Filmed,"Well the guy knows how to film, he really amped it up for the craven remake Hills have eyes. High Tension is well filmed but the twist is stupid, stupid, stupid, to the point of insulting the veiwer...could have used more blood and lots of nudity..."
1,This Movie Doesn't make the Grade,"I bought this movie after reading some of the reviews. It seemed to me that this would be a good movie with a twist. The movie is not what you think and that can be a good thing but, in this case this is not a good thing.This movie had to be written by at least two people, one started it and the other person finished it with out reading what the 1st writter wrote.If you watch this movie or have seen it I ask you one question, Where does the truck come from?"
1,Too bad....,Couldn't even watch it....mouth movements do not even match the timing of what is being said. I could only watch the first 5 minutes.
3,Grotesque but not very scary,"While there are moments that can be described as dreadful, there's little here that can be described as ""scary."" Of course, I am likely desensitized after viewing so many horror movies, which is why I'm giving it 3 stars rather than 2.I don't know if the problem was the pacing or the acting, but there wasn't much suspense. At least, not enough to satisfy a true horror buff.Nice try though."
3,Been there done that,I like this film as a whole. It was well written and the acting and cinematography was good....but the plot twist has been done to death. I won't tell you what it is because I don't want to ruin it but many movies have used the same plot twist and done a better job of it.
4,SCARIFYING.,"i have read alot of reviews of this film bellyaching that it rips off dean koontz, but i really don't think he all that great of a writer (hack hack)anyway, so don't let that deter you.first off, i was scared absolutely witless and by the end of the film i was actually shaking. i normally do not get so frightened, but then again, most films aren't this frightening.it does travel very well-worn paths, but somehow, no matter what, when a girl is hiding under a bed listening to the screams of people being murdered around her followed by footsteps entering the room she is in, well, that is ALWAYS frightening.everytime you think you know what is about to happen, it confounds you.granted, the ending is woefully stupid, and looking back over the rest of the film, really makes no sense, as if they got lazy at the end and decided they didn't want to think any harder for a better ending. but if you want to be scared, get this one."
3,Eh.... It just didn't make sense,"The idea was interesting, tho it reminded me alot of Dean Koontz's Intensity, but by the end it just didn't make much sense. I mean, Where did she get the truck? What was with the severed head scene? So much of the movie just did not go with the general plot of her multiple personality and the movie seemed to change it's story half way thru to be more shocking... like I said it was a decent idea, just had too many holes for my taste."
4,"Intense gore, high action sequences","High Tension is a highly disturbing visual masterpiece. One of the better made horror movies of recent date. The kill scenes in the first 30 minutes are as realistic as they are intense and brutal. And then the real terror begins as a cat-and-mouse chase between the killer and the victim ensues, leaving a bloody trail behind. Other reviewers have been disappointed with the ending but, without spoiling the ending, I will leave you with this thought- I found many subtle hints throughout the movie to lead up to the ""twist"" ending. The killer's mind is a highly disturbing and visual place.Side notes- kudos to LionsGate for releasing the unrated version. The English dubbed over for the first part of the movie is done well and the transition to subtitles in the second half is smooth. The dvd has the usual standard features and interesting commentary by Cecile de France and the director."
3,Disingenuous...,"... is the best word I can think of for this film. Twist endings are one thing but when a film outright lies to you and then takes off in a different direction altogether then my blood rises to my face. I think maybe the producers were going for the ""Keyser Soze"" effect but, IMHO, they failed miserably.Apart from that, it would have made a fine film. Like others have said, gore hounds will love it. Three stars for the gore and creepy attitude."
3,Ending Still Needs Work,"After seeing High Tension you start to think why people were making such a big deal about Hostel because this movie goes crazy with the gore. The film was going in a good direction until the amazing but horrible end. The ending is lazy and you'll see what I mean when you see it. Basically your being leaded to believe one thing and that belief is ripped right from under you when they switch everything up. They give the story away very obviously in the beginning and I think they thought nobody was going to notice it. I'll tell you what your basically getting in this film, your getting gore, not as much high tension as they say it will give you, and a half done story that definitely has been done before."
3,Haute Tension,"This movie was really confusing. I liked the fact that the action started at the beginning when the doorbell rang but after the murderer and the two girls left the house it got boring. The ending totally confused me and there were so many points in the movie when i was like how was that possible if she was the killer. I saw so many horror movies in this movie, the old truck that is Jeepers Creepers, the chainsaw, it was very repetitive and not original. The only thing that was original was the ending. But i liked it better before i found out that the blonde was the killer."
1,What complete garbage,"ATTENTION!!!!! SPOILER IS LISTED IN THE NEXT LINE!!!!! STOP READING NOW IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS FILM!!What garbage. DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS PIECE OF DRECK!! What a complete rip off of Secret Window. These guys should be sued for plagarism. I wonder if they called Stephen King before they did this film?I first got an linkling what was to come when the 2 girls were in the truck and Alex was crying staring at Marie with this ""I can't believe you are doig this!"" stare.I can't put into words what a COMPETE RIP OFF AND LET DOWN THIS MOVIE WAS."
2,Tres stupid,"A predictable fright-fest with acting far better than the all too typical script. You've seen all these tropes worked and reworked many times before. The only thing new is the twist ending, which doesn't work at all. The difference between subjective and objective points of view are totally disregarded to supply the ending, and it's a colossal failure of narrative logic. I only give it two stars because it has a few visceral moments among the recycled set pieces, and the acting of the two leading women is quite powerful."
2,Blatent (and poor) rip-off of Dean Koontz's Intensity,"I don't know where to start with this over-hyped horror film. I think it is the first French horror film I have seen, and while I don't mind subtitles, I found the switching from subtitles to dubbing distracting. Then of course there is the first 3/4 of the film which is a complete rip-off of the book Intensity by Dean Koontz (which was also an excellent, far superior made-for-tv movie). There are also poor special effects in the kill scenes. The acting is excellent, but the surprise! twist ending is ludacris. At the end I was just sorry I had wasted my time watching this."
2,VERY LAME!,"Not a good movie by any means. Strange soundtrack, non-sensical plot, and bizarre dubbing/subtitling (never seen it done worse). I cant seem to make sense of the ""twist"" in the third act. On the plus side the gore is solid and the cinematography is occasionally quite good as is the pacing/editing. Overall, a silly, mindless, DIRTY little film for people who were lost by the intellectual density of ""House of a Thousand Corpses""!"
2,Quite poor,"Perhaps because it's French I expected this film to be more stylish than the average horror film... not a chance. The whole thing looks like it was shot by a couple of junior college film students and the musical score was more humorous than forboding.After the big ""twist"" (which again seemed cooked up by some rather dim bulbs), you're left wondering what the first hour was all about. Usually twists make at least some sense in the context of the film, but in this one the ""twist"" just juxtaposes two different scripts. This might be the first film ever to attempt combining the lack of a plot and plot holes all into one reel.If it weren't for the leading actress (who just happens to be amazingly attractive), I would've walked out after the first killing sequence."
3,HIGH TENSION FIZZLES OUT,"For most of its running time, HIGH TENSION is a mindless, albeit suspenseful, retread of many slasher movies of the past. Fueled by the presence of Cecile DeFrance in the leading role, the movie manages to keep us enthralled with the plight of a young girl who is trying to escape the murderer who has brutally slayed the family of her best friend. What undoes the movie however is its ludicrous plot twist that is so outrageous, it can't be believed for a minute. While to be applauded for an attempt to put a new twist on the tired genre, HIGH TENSION falls apart with its contrived and unbelievable ending. Too bad, it was doing great up until then."
1,The director must be nuts,The first 75% of the movie was OK. But after that...what the hell? It turns into a s**t with NO LOGIC. Save yourselves the cash and don't get this. Deserves 0 stars.
1,Buyer Beware,"I liked the PC version, but the handheld version is expensive, hard to use and not that much value. When compared to MS Streets and Maps it is not even in the same league. The Bluetooth feature is problematic and the tech support is poor. In both versions there seems to be a bug that introduces a position error of about 200 feet. This seems to be problem for both the hand held and PC editions. If this keeps up I expect DeLorme to be out of business within 2 years. Too bad---It has the potential to be world class."
4,I enjoyed this book - it was refreshing,"I love working with Lotus Notes, and am thrilled with the value the product adds to my clients. I found this book facsinating in that (1) it dealt with a version of Notes that I hadn't used before, and (2) it provided a catalogue of applications, and talked about how each would add value to the business. It was great. I plan to tell all my clients about the book, and loan them my copy if they want to read it for themselves.Perhaps now that R5 is just about here, and the development capabilities of Notes have been extended significantly, it's time for version 2 of the book."
1,IT'S A DUD!!!!,"Actually, I rate this procuct a ZERO!!! But I had to enter at least one star. Emailed Kevhead Media on May 23, 2011. No repsonse as of June 3, 2011. DVD starts to play, but then picture cuts out and there is sound only... tried to play it in my laptop and it will not even read it!!!! Plus when I first opened the case, the disc was covered in some white powerdery substance. I had to go sanitize it before I even tried it!!!This was claimed to be NEW!!!! So now I'm out $20plus, where is the justice??? Will never shop on Amazon or Kevhead Media again!!! I just wanted a good laugh, guess you're the one's laughing now huh?"
1,Sleeping in a van down by the River!!,You must be sleeping in a van down by the River!! Come back to reality please. Don't make a comment on a video without it being released yet. We all watched the tribute to Chris Farley on our particular NBC channel. Thank you and Goodnight
2,Water Damaged Book,"The book that I purchased said it was supposed to be new, and the book that I received has water damage starting on the first page to the 131st page. If I had wanted a used water damaged book, I wouldn't of paid almost $40 for it."
4,"A CD which gives a ""I love life"" feeling.","I really didn't know what to think of this record. I had never listened to any of Cybill Shepherd's music so I really had no idea and found no samples anywhere on the web.I decided to go for it anyway and buy the CD, and I don't regret it a bit.It's a nice, happy and diverse album, with exactly the kind of music one would expect from a woman coming from Memphis and who has, among other things, dated Elvis. ;-)It makes for 45 enjoyable minutes. Really makes me think Cybill Shepherd loves life and manages to convey some of this feeling with her music."
3,Be Warned No English Subtitles,"I just think potential buyers should know that this title has no English subtitles. The English language description of the product is deceptive. So watch out! Otherwise, the movie is as advertised."
2,Ridiculous,"There should be a freaken support group for people who are going to take the CSET. Seriously. There just isn't any study guide out there that really, trully helps in a focused, realistic, effective way.I'm studying this damn book's history section and I'm about ready to kill myself. It's so damn unfocused and jumps from one thing to another and then comes back to what it was talking about like ten pages later. I'm pretty damn sure this was written in about five minutes and just slapped together to be sold. I hate the writer of the history section. I really hate them."
2,hm...,"I took only the CSET Mult II section so far. Before i took it, i read science section briefly and did the practice test. Although i passed it on my first try, i was so disapointed that none of the questions from study guide helped me. But the CD is good to have it because it shows the score and you get the idea of how well you did it. I don't know how's other section but I am getting new study guides for section I &III."
5,Overlooked Western Classic,"Maybe Randolph Scott's best movie, 7 Men from Now is an overlooked classic of the western genre. Scott is a revenge minded former sheriff, who is gunning for the 7 outlaws that killed his wife in a hold up. This familiar storyline is sparked by great supporting characters. Great performances by Scott, a young Lee Marvin and Gail Russell. Highly recommended."
5,MELODRAMA AT ITS BEST,"If you're into the work of Jackie Collins and Harold Robbins, you'll have a ball with SCANDALS, for this over-the-top romp of the rich and famous is pure guilty pleasure. Colorful characters, sexual escapades, dirty little secrets, it's all there. A must.-----Martin Boucher"
3,Great Cinematography,Looks real cool! Great ambient settings. Love the powerboat to Cuba! But the story is lacking. Gotta like the music and the images though. Worth watching if you got nothing better to do on a rainy night.
1,WHAT HAPPENED? CANCEL THIS TRIP TO MIAMI,"What I thought was going to be one of the greatest film this year is the most disappointing by far. Too long, mean and uneven. Partially filmed like Cops, the camera work was shaky, and on a large screen that just gave me a headache. Colin & Jamie are wasted. The look gruff, not slick. They hadly speak and I'm not buying them as partners. Boring, long drawn out sequences go on and on and on. No musical score, no hippness to it. Yawn Yawn. I fell asleep in spots. This could have been the movie of the year, instead its the movie of the weak."
1,Stick with the original series,"Having just come from a screening, I must say, that was the worst movie I have seen in a long time. The attempt at gritty cinematography looked like it was filmed using a cell phone camera. The dialog was stunted and cliche to the point where people in the audience were laughing at how bad it was. The pacing made it feel much longer than it actually was and all the characters in the movie had an overly serious look about them the entire time. Judging by the audience's reaction, I'm not the only one who thought it was horrible. I had higher expectations given the cast."
3,Interesting...,"I'm reading through the other reviews and find the commentary intersting. Most complaints are that there is not enough action and way too much talk...Personally, I thought there was plenty of action but didn't find the characters developed enough. The relationships seemed very flat and unbelievable to me. Much of the violence and action was supposedly caused by these relationships, jealousy, etc.Bottomline: I didn't find a balance between Cause (relationships) and Effect (action). The Effect was there, the Cause wasn't."
4,"Forget the TV show, take Vice at face value","I thought this was a great film through and through. Great cinematography, great soundtrack, compelling story, believable characters. It brought out strong feelings, and even though I am not familiar with the criminal underworld, I felt I could relate to the characters as people. I could really feel their inner conflicts, which I think was the entire point of the film (ad slogan - ""No rules, No law, No order"")I never saw a single episode of the TV show. I do not hold any bitter feelings toward Mann for supposedly failing to live up to the legacy, as some have suggested. I think those folks are lost in the '70s and can't admit that Farrell and Foxx have done a fantastic job bringing Miami Vice up to the times."
2,Miami Vice,"First of all, please don't waste your money buying it. I'd wait till it hits cable. The movie was very dark, and nothing like the television show(that it was inspired from?). If you're looking for what was so cool about the show, you won't find it in the film. I'll give it 2 stars at best."
1,This remake didn't stand a chance,You knew it was going to be terrible just by looking at it. Look who was cast to play Sonny and Rico.Colin Farrell as Sonny doesn't fit. Sonny is supposed to be a Miami native. Why cast a potty-mouthed irishman; then dye his hair blonde?Jamie Foxx as Rico doesn't fit either. Rico is supposed to be Cuban. Why cast an African American from Texas?
3,More Like 2 and a Half Stars,"First off, I really like Michael Mann. He has a great visual eye and when the action comes around, he always does something different and intense. That is true for this movie as well, only there is so little action it almost bores you to sleep. For me the problem was the whole middle of the film w/Colin and Li; It's almost like a whole different movie....I liked the set up in the beginning; I have the patience to allow a story to unfold, don't get me wrong...but this movie had no business being this long. Both Foxx and Farrell are actually perfect for their parts, and I found the performances enjoyable. Loved the sniper rifle scene near the start, the trailer scene and shootout near the end; The cinematography, as expected, captures alot of great images and skyscapes; The boat scene at the beginning is very impressive...but in the end I can make this into a really solid 1 hour and twenty minute movie w/the help of my fast forward button...I suggest you do the same."
1,Take my 1 Star and minus a star!!!,"I laugh at all those people that write an editorial in their reviews!!! You guys must be in Hollywood or something. Or you don't really have much to do.Here's my review.1) Movie was too long.2) No character chemistry. You felt Sonny was running the show and Tubbs was just along for the ride.3) Love scenes were long and drawn out and TOO frequent. Same problem with Heat. Which I felt was a good movie, but again, Michael Mann doesn't know when to stop the love scenes.4) Dialogue wasn't clearly spoken at times.My advice, save your $9.50 at the movies and wait until cable runs it.Terrible movie."
1,Blu-Ray review only,"Miami Vice is a great movie but don't waste your money on the Blu-Ray version.I'm not sure if it's because the movie is filmed with a 'dark' theme but the HD is worthless. In fact, I put my regular Mice dvd in my Blu-Ray player and parts of it looked better."
1,The TV Show is better,I don't see hardly anything the same between the movie and the TV show. Colin Farrell looked like a greasy bum and Jamie Foxx had no part at all. No action until the very end of the movie - I almost fell asleep half way through. Music wasn't very good and the way the movie starts with the blue words on the black screen - made it look like a sci- fi film. Was a waste of time for me.
3,"Good movie, but could have been better","Overall I enjoyed the movie. Good action, good actors. But it was kinda too dark and I believe they could have written and directed much better. It reminded me a bit of Bad Boys series which I think were much better"
4,You'll like it if you liked COLLATERAL,"This hits the refresh button on the old groundbreaking '80s cop show, bringing it into the twenty-first century and making it much darker and grittier than its predecessor. Gone is the music video flash, the neon colors, the cheesy comedy-sidekick informants like Izzy and Noogie, and the rock music over the gunfight scenes. Gina has changed from a sassy sex-object brunette to a quietly lethal blonde. Even the scale of the story has increased along with the level of technology used by the drug runners they're trying to shut down. It's more dramatic thriller that plays like an unofficial sequel toCollateral (Two-Disc Special Edition)than action movie, but it's good."
3,Directors cut is really good,"I enjoyed this one at the movies, but this new cut is much better. A real treat, very stylish. great extras on this disc too."
1,truly abysmal,"i usually dont bash bad movies (as I try to avoid viewing them) but I made the mistake of watching this and want everyone to know that it should be avoided. the director, Michael Mann, likes to pride himself on being a bit of a outlaw. He succeeded by getting away with highway robbery and making this abomination."
1,Terrible,"I don't want to even waste time writing a long review for this terrible movie. I honestly is worse than a bad crime B movie. First of all, it starts off with no explanation of what is happening, there is no character development, nor any legible plotline. The dialog is congested and uncomprehendable. You will feel as if someone threw you into the middle of a movie and left you with nothing but two actors that have no chemistry or longing to engage you. I was lucky enough to get my money back, I only hope anyone else will not waste their time buying and watching this sorry excuse for a film."
3,plot is tough to follow,"I loved the 80's TV show so I was eager to see this. But boy is it different from the show. Don't expect to see Crockett's sailboat, his Scarab, his Spyder, or even Elvis. Don't expect to see the other vice cops either. The plot is tough to follow with a lot of fast dialogue with tons of jargon. But its a seemingly well made film that has me interested enough to watch it again so that I can hopefully understand the plot. The HD DVD picture quality was mixed. Some shots, whether night or day, looked very clear and sharp, while other shots (mostly in cars, boats, or planes) were much noiser. I have to wonder if they used 2 different cameras or if this was done for style. This is a pricy combo so it may be wise to just rent it if you're not sure you'll like it."
2,I honestly don't know what to say...,"This was just awful. I'll give it two stars for Tubbs and Trudy. That's about it. Farrell, who is very much overrated in my opinion, needed a shower and some motivation to do a decent job acting, while Gong Li, who is normally intense and stunning, just looked bored. Problem is, I don't think it was their fault. This was a horrid script. It made no sense, there was no real chemistry between Farrell and Foxx or Farrell and Li (gee, is he the common denominator of badness for this film?). This had to have been a paycheck film for everyone involved. Save your money, don't even rent this."
3,Technical Information,"If you get an error message when you play the HD DVD version of Miami Vice or King Kong, call Toshiba's customer service line and ask for the firmware update disc. It cleared up the problem on my machine and now plays fine."
4,More Style than Content I Think,"Miami Vice the TV series mixed both style and social commentary on the self-centeredness of our society. You sometimes couldn't tell the good guys from the players but our heroes Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs remained true blue. I am not sure what director Michael Mann's intent was with this film. It is darker, grittier and not my father's Miami Vice but it does have appeal. I am still trying to fathom the story and what the social implications and statement that Mann is making here."
2,Wouldn't program properly,"I couldn't get this to program properly. I've programmed many garage door openers, and I carefully followed the instructions. I also ensured that I bought the correct model. But when I programmed it, both my garage doors would operate off of either button (so both doors opened and closed instead of just one at a time). I read everything I could find on the internet, and contacted both the vendor and the manufacturer, but still no luck.On the plus side, the vendor promptly processed the return without hassle."
1,don't buy it,"Besides being light on details, the copy I got had several key pages missing - there but just blank. Shows a lack of attention to detail. If you are just getting started in the tanning/leather/rawhide business it is an OK read about history and techniques but there are better books on the market. Get this one from the library."
2,Ok book on tanning,"Good title that doesn't deliver on substance. Rather than providing information on a few of the important aspects of tanning hides the author covers far to much of the topic, what you get are introductory paragraphs leaving you with the need for another resource."
2,wrong information,"This item was not the one we thought we were getting.The pad was for women, we wanted a male heavy ultimate (heavy).We cannot use these. We cannotsend them back as we had to openone pack and then found out they were wrong."
1,Who is this singer and why is she singing Shania's songs?,"This is an obvious consumer rip-off. No where on the CD cover does this state that Shania is not the artist. Furthermore, the singer is so bad, she is not identified by name. Shania fans beware, you are not getting the real deal. My 7 year old niece Mackenzie could do a better job with her older brother Matthew singing backup."
3,So-so in the tropics,"I'm beginning to believe that there's no anti-fog product that will work when you're living on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. Based on the reviews, this one seemed to be my best bet to prevent my spectacles and camera lens from fogging when leaving an air-conditioned area for the hot and humid outside air.Unfortunately, it does not work at all for spectacles and with limited success on the camera lens. However, I will continue to use this product until something better comes along, as instead of the whole lens fogging up after being treated, there were only random patches of fog on the camera lens, and these cleared up a lot faster than with the untreated lens. (I gave up on the spectacle lenses)If anyone can suggest what I may be doing wrong, I'll be more than pleased to revisit this review through fog-free lenses.Amanda Richards, December 15, 2011"
1,Please shoot me in the head.,"Obviously, this horse is past her prime.I knew that it would be bad, because it was written by hardie...but I bought it anyway.Do yourselves a favour, avoid the migraine that this silly thing gave me and get something else!This is not Paganism, this is not Wicca, this isn't even magick, this is silly."
3,A slick and smooth experiment,"Not a career-capper for La Liza, but not an embarrassment either. It's Euro-disco ... co-produced by The Pet Shop Boys, but they've got Minnelli in a fresh, low key, and she sounds great on ""I Want You Now"" and the chilling ""Losing My Mind"". Also incredible: the surprisingly tender ""So Sorry I Said"". Other tracks are just middling, and certainly don't live up to the terrific shots of Liza on the CD package, but it's a very interesting melding of different generations and provides pleasant diversion."
3,Liza the Stalker,"This record may have its amusements, i.e. Liza as Neil and Chris' muse, but when all is said and done, the songs just don't stick. The opener, ""I want you now"", is ghastly, I can't help but get creeped out at Liza's strident delivery of ""I want you now, and I won't take no for an answer."" Clearly, the boys have cast liza in the role of a stalker. Watch out! Love Pains, Losing my Mind, Don't Drop Bombs all suffer from dated production values. The only song here with a kind of charm is ""If there was love."" Liza reciting Shakespeare's sonnet over the end coda is actually quite moving, elegiac shall we say, bringing a genuine tear to mine eye. It helps me to forget Liza as a stalker."
5,very good,i think this is a very good album with a few really outstanding songs. such a shame it's never been released on CD to my knowledge.
3,MOON RANGER,"This is a cool sounding rock album,but it should not be called Night Ranger!Yes i'm a hardcore night ranger fan since the Dawn patrol album.This music is good but, Moon Ranger would seriously be the name they should have used,without the voice of Jack and jeff's awesome dueling guitar,it's not the right elements to call it Night Ranger.This is great sounding music and Gary has awesome vocals,but the only hint of Night Ranger is Brad's guitar style and the songs that Kelly sings,so while it sounds fresh and different, it's not really the same."
4,for serious walkers,"If you care about walking fast, and especially if you care about your place in walking races (judged racewalks or otherwise) then this book is for you.This book isn't designed to sell anyone on walking as a sport; this is written for readers who already know that they want to spend time and effort into learning to walk fast.There are sections on many of the aspects of walking; e. g. technique, drills to perfect technique, common racewalking errors, and a few workout schedules. The book is written in a conversational style. He also includes interviews with elite racewalkers.There is also a handy chart which outlines: ""if you have problem X, correct it with Y"" which is VERY helpful; this helped me in getting zero cautions or redcards in my last 4 judged walks.If there is a downside it is that some of the photos are a bit small; I'd also recommend that he upgrade his ""poor technique"" example photo to look a bit worse; perhaps he could use a photo of a thick-skinned novice walker."
2,Watch Out for Price Gouging,"I was very surprised and upset when I received this order to find that the cover price was $17.99. I paid almost $40 for the the book. I will do my homework on all purchases from Amazon much better in the future. For those looking for this book at a reasonable price, you can order it directly from the author for $19.99 (the current edition)."
2,Creative? yes Worth it? No,"I am afraid I must be the lone dissenter in the review of this particular adventure. First, on the good side. The traps and challenges presented in this module are very creative. They would challenge even some of the most experienced and paranoid players out there. As with the classic Tomb of Horrors, there are a myriad number of ways to die if the party is not constantly on its toes.The problem comes when the adventure is over. IN MY OPINION, the characters do not have much to show for things when all is said and done. On a risk-reward type of basis, the risks for outstrip the rewards the characters receive, especially when dealing with the lowest level of the dungeon.With some retooling, the adventure could work, but as it stands, it was a bit disappointing."
3,Garnier's roots.,"What can I say? This was one of his ealier albums, he had a lot of great concepts but had yet to find the refining he needed. Some of the tracks drone on for too long, much more trance styled in that some repeat too much. Also I am a big critic on recording merit. His newer albums are recorded much better, this entire cd kinda falls flat. No sharp, bright, crackling highs and no low, rumbling, rolling lows. Sorry Laurent, this one is 3 at best."
3,a good record,30 is a good record that has it's highs and it's lows like all records.the hoe is a great song but it just gets bogged in some places.i recommend it though cos it's a record that grows on you alot. i think garnier is a great artist that will really release a classic.
4,Robert Fisk-Pity the Nation,"Good Book in case you need to get a neutral opinion about the war in Lebanon.. I am still reading and reading,,,,,,,,,,,,"
4,Still Good,"I was worried about buying this album because I heard it was more on the lines of Nevermore and I don't like Nevermore and it is more like Nevermore but this album is still different,you can't beat an album that's is good as Refuge Denied but Into The Mirror Black is good.Warrel Dane does not sing high on this album like he does on Refuge Denied he only does it some times.Future Tense is awesome,good song to start the album.Taste Revenge has awesome lyrics,just the name alone you know what it's about.The Mirror Black is my favorite song on the album.The only song's I don't like on this album are Seasons Of Destruction and Communion.This album is still good and still different then Nevermore."
2,I'm glad I'm not a metalhead,"My friend recorded this onto a cassette when I was 17 and I thought it was ok. I used to love the vocalist's singing style. I found it in a record shop on vinyl and bought it just to see if my memory of the album (as really good) was correct. I must say that the vocals are quite laughable - lots of vibrato and falsetto. The guy can sing in parts, I guess. The guitar is technically proficient but strangely lacking. I can take it or leave it (in fact I have left it in my mother in law's attic) - along with much of the rest of the 'true metal' of the 80s. Anyway, being a metalhead is myopic."
2,Don't waste your time.,"Maybe I have funky ears but the gelfoams that come with the EarBoom are worthless. I have a Nokia 8260 and love the earbud that came with it. However, I lost the small foam piece (covering the earbud) which actually helps hold the earbud in place. Since then, its been tough to keep the earbud in my ear without the foam piece.I decided to buy the EarBoom as a replacement. Bad mistake. In addition to not staying in my ear, the intonation is tinny at best. The only reason I gave this product even 2 stars was that it had a foam piece on the microphone portion of the EarBoom which I have placed on my Nokia earbud. Small retribution but worth a couple of stars."
5,I always keep a few extra good books to read.,"Now, This one, I haven't had the chance to read and so it will have to wait until I finish the one I am reading now."
4,Exciting Album - Dont' Believe the Hype,"This album has some fantastic, and often surprising, music on it. It also has a partly spoken-word piece that apparently is difficult for listeners unaccustomed to the provocative politic ground that spoken-word inhabits. But for those who are more interested in good music than political censorship, this album has a lot to offer. Don't believe those who say that one track prevents a CD from being worthwhile. You'd be missing some truly exciting jazz."
1,Be very sure you want this particular book,"I found that this book has enough technical information but reading it is probably harder than writing the exam. It is unstructured, assumes knowledge of topics not yet covered,not thorough in explanations.I am an MCSE+I and I had so much difficulty with this book that I abandoned it 4 chapters in. I used web resources to write and pass the exam Brian Talbert and Stuart Shay have excellent notes ( search the net for them)and I would read those rather than this book anyday!!"
3,A Quick Archeological Report,"This video does not provide as thorough a historical review on Nefertiti as Nefertiti Resurrected does; but that video is over two hours long. Resurrected mentions the cript where the mummified remains are contained as does Nefertiti Resurrected, however, one mummified remains is missing from this video and never mentioned. It seems to contradict the video Nefertiti Resurrected, although this video is newer, and new information may have been learned in the interim. What bothers me is that one of the archeologists is the same in both videos, and he never mentions the third mummy or even acknowledges that it was ever there. Why? Provides a quick glimpse of Egypt at that time."
2,"Exciting subject, dismal translation","The author of this book attempted to tackle a very interesting subject but, to the English-language readership's chagrin, did not seem to bother to have the presumably Dutch original either translated into proper English or proof-read. The result is a linguistic hodge-podge which precludes any kind of meaningful reading. Trying to decipher what the author is trying to say is often an extremely frustrating experience. This book has shocked and saddened me."
2,DON'T SPEND U MONEY,"With that money, i can buy many's regular bulb, is the same...i get those bulbs last week, and i'm not so happy...."
5,More than Words,"Caren Goldman has written a book about more than words. Rather than pious platitudes, her reflections out of the depth of her own experience turn familiar words into icons of healing and hope. I am grateful for her sharing what she knows and lives in a way that matter to me."
2,Couldn't get into it,"I really expected to enjoy this but I found it heavy going. Of course the subject is tough but I usually enjoy historical novels, particularly when you discover more about the consequences of major events on people. I found the book difficult to keep up with and I didn't gain any attachment to the characters. Whilst I did gain some knowledge on psychology, I was disappointed by the apparent conclusion of the book, but maybe I missed something. This, of course may say more about me than the book."
2,Lack of appreciation,"I read Birdsong and was stunned. WW1 came alive for me and the sheer scope of the tragedy. I couldn't wait for Pat Barker's book - WHAT A LET DOWN! I have given 2 stars because it is reasonably written, but she brings none of Faulks intrinsic understanding of the male condition under such circumstances. All in all she lacks an appreciation of what was happening at a human level. Good try, but not well done; and the trilogy won a booker?"
4,Regeneration gives new life to WWI era strorys,"I was pleasantly surprised by regeneration. What I thought would be another ""war book"" turned out to have heart, as well as an interesting story line. Tired of the romanticizing of war that often goes along with these depictions of World War I, I loved the way the different patients' gruesome stories of war weaved together. I was most intrigued by Dr. Rivers and his fear that the emotionally painful work he is doing with his patients will not pay off in the end but will have caused more damage to them."
2,"this is about the remaster, not the songs","i always want Dan's records in the best sound possible & this is an excellent album so i bought this, but unfortunately i was blown away in a negative way by the loudness of the remastering. this is a case of where the remastering is too loud.what's special about Dan's music is it's melodious & soulfulness, but on this remaster, it becomes Metallica in a bad way.i played the original cd to compare & the music there is natural, clear, warm & pleasant. i also compared the remastering from the Portrait box set & there the remastering was done well, an improvement, but not hammering loud. IMO, keep or buy the original cd."
5,This will last me forever!,"I have a springer pistol that I use indoors with a gel target, which has a hopper built in to catch the BB's. Because they don't get damaged, I can reuse the BB's pretty much indefinitely. I've been using them for almost a year, and besides the few that get lost around the room, the bottle is still completely full."
2,Disappointing,"I usually use crosman's 0.25bbs with my co2 airsoft (0.25's are awesome), but as they are so heavy they are 'difficult to stop' at the time of doing indoors target practice, so I decided to buy lighter bb's so I could set more effective bb traps.Since the crosman's I had been using were so well made, I decided to buy the crosman's 0.12.Ok they are lighter and easier to catch, they don't ruin your traps etc, BUT man, they curbe sooooo much, they might hit straight 6 times over 10, the other ones curbe a lot in any given direction, it seams that the more co2 is left in the canister the more unprecise the shots are.The bottle says 'seamless', it is just not true.This 0.12 bbs are made in greece, instead of taiwan (where the 0.25 are made), so it's clear that the manufacturer has much poor standards.I was a fool thinking those would be OK for indoor practice, will never buy these again.I'll just stick to the 0.20 as my lightest weight ammunition option, period."
3,Tap Music,"I also found the last song was a favorite, and am glad to have found it here after many years of searching. All the music is engaging."
2,Don't use on win 2000 or xp,"I purchased Dogs and Catz for my children to play with because 5 sounds to advanced for them. The problem is I cannot get either to run on windows XP or 2000, even though I have installed all the patches. I also cannot get IBM Via phone to work. Catz and Dogz 2 still works fine on both versions though-go figure?Update I finaly got the games working, but not the Via phone. It took alot of searching to find it and it requires editing the registry. To get to it go to the petz website and click on technical support, then go to fequently asked questions. Do a search on Petz and then read the one that has ""While starting, the program the yellow progress bar located at the bottom of the screen freezes up."" as the subject. Follow the instructions and most of your problems will go away."
5,petz4,"I have catz4 and I think it's tons of fun! I recently bought dogz4 and I love it! I also own babyz, it's great too. I think this is a great game for kids and that I would recomend to anyone who loves animals."
1,extremely disappointing.,"dogz 4 is an overpriced, useless product, which should be taken off the store shelves. myself, i love the other programs (petz 3 in particular), so when the new ones came out i was expecting more. much more. the graphics are messy, the voice recognition works like jack, you end up being stuck with all these things you don't need, and they OBVIOUSLY did not spend enough time in it's building. if there was such as thing as 1/2 a star, that would be my rating. if you really want a virtual petz program, wait for the rumored ""petz 2000"" or just buy petz 3. don't waste your money on this crap. it's not worth it AT ALL."
2,eh,"Not worth buying if you are trying to drift. Does give some information but no unique advice that can't easily be found elsewhere. It also says that the ae86 corolla has independent rear suspension, which is wrong."
5,Obscure Heavy Seventies Classic!,"Australian heavy metal from the early '70s. Driving rhythms, Iommi-style riffing, with a powerful, John Kay, (of STEPPENWOLF,) -like vocals on hard and heavy songs reminiscent of early Nugent.Also worth the search is the 1974 follow-up to this one, ""Only Want You For Your Body."""
5,My wife loves it!,"Wasn't sure if it was the right one, but the details seemed to match. Delivered promptly and safely. She loves it! Thanks!"
2,Witch,"I read all the reviews before buying the book so am somewhat taken aback by my reaction during my reading. I'm an avid reader and enjoy Ian rankin but frankly this is a flat, boring read for me. I'll finish it but it's hard going. All the characters bar none are totally uninteresting and the word and action play between Doyle and Greenleaf just plan silly and irritating. It's hard to believe this book and the Rebus and Malcolm Fox books were written by the same person."
1,The Worst,"On 3 different Macs initial backups failed with 10s of thousands of errors. Tried different drives. Networked or not networked. Returned 2 firewire drives thinking they were the problem. Not.If you buy this make sure you test it out thoroughly before your 30 days are up. After wasting days of my time trying to work these problems I called tech support, on the 41st day. For $70 they would have helped me. I declined.I used this software 10 or 12 years ago and loved it. Times have changed."
4,Quality holiday music,"All in all, a superior holiday collection. Judy's lovely voice and beautiful arrangements add to the intelligent choice of tunes, including some Collins compositions and the wonderful, seldom-heard Cherry Tree Carol. This collection was previously released in the mid-90s, minus a couple of the songs, as Come Rejoice: A Judy Collins Christmas. With the new tunes added (including a duet with Tyne Daly) it makes for a nice debut for Judy's own record label. There are a couple of vocal flaws on this one but the album's beauty overwhelms any problems. Also reccomended: Judy's other recent holiday CD and video, Christmas at the Biltmore Estate."
4,Reader from far-south of rio grande,"Archaeology prove maybe inconsistent in this book, but, ¿Who cares?. The authors' obvious intentions are not to give full proove of nothing written in the bible in a idiotic and religious way, but a skeptik one. If you want to enjoy this book, just go beyond an absurd empiricism and think that any bible is another fun, ancient, historical, philosophical, book like the Popol Vuh, or Gilgamesh. I mean, the bible is an important book, full of historical and geographical references. If you are a nonsense moralist, religious fanatic, or a frustated archaeologist, do not buy it."
4,Stories start on page 78 with the exception of Rick Bass,"So I read the Hermit's Story as the lead off and skipped the next four stories because they just couldn't hold my interest through the first few sentences. The rest of the selections are decent reading some are up to the level of Rick Bass' piece and Annie Proulx's The Bunchgrass Edge of the World, some are not. Lorrie Moore's two pages of HA HA's nearly put me off what is really a pretty good story, although she makes it tough to buy into the second thread with the abrupt change.I thought Jhumpa Lahiri's Interpreter of Maladies one of the best stories in this edition. Even without those lost sixty-two pages, the rest is worth the price of the tradepaper edition."
1,Most Boring BASS Ever,"This is by far the dullest collection of the usually high-caliber Best American Short Story Collection. There are so many ""bad"" stories here, one wonders what Ms. Tan was thinking. However, the Rick bass story and one by Nathan Englander prevent the collection from being what seems to be an almost complete Junior Varsity element to the collection....next year get a better editor, because boredom should not be a prerequisite for storytelling."
3,crappy disc,"I bought this disc for a dollar at Amoeba music in San Francisco. I can't attest to the quality of the actual film, because as I was removing the disc from its case it snapped completely in half. Its a shame, because it looked like a cheesy little time killer, and I'm sure as hell not going to spend 25 bucks to replace it. oh well, maybe i'll catch it on sci fi one day..."
2,Clipless,"Several things make this case a piece of junk, from the poor fit of the case on the phone, to the less-than-positive action of the clip.I managed to find my phone on the ground several times after thinking I had it clipped on.Managed to find the phone in the process of calling unknown numbers because the cover was pressing on keys as I walked merrily along.Wouldn't recommend this item to anyone wishing to carry their phone with them!!!"
5,First and Last,"""Southern Breeze"" was the first of Jeri's three albums on Roulette, a great Marty Paich-arranged album with a scorching vocal on ""Porgy"" and a lot else going for it. ""Coffee..."" was the last Roulette album, arranged hauntingly by Lennie Hayton, who really knew how to showcase Jeri's voice and style. This is one of the truly great torch albums, a legend in its time. Both albums add up to great listening and you'll play them over and over because there's so much to hear each time in Jeri's interpretations."
5,X -- We're desperate for this video!,"With the 1998 release of a double-disc anthology and an all-too-brief tour with the sorely missed Billy Zoom, history has recently rediscovered the glories of X, and aging, literate alterna-kids have been standing up in all kinds of respectable places to reaffirm their allegiance to, yes, I'll say it, the greatest band in the world. (Sure, there are hundreds of greatest bands in the world. Hyperbole's cheap. Believe me, X gets invited to all the meetings.) So where can we find the definitive film biography of this most perfect of late-century distillations of what we still call rock and roll? We can't! It's unavailable! But oh, how we want it! Hello, Mr/Ms Video Distribution Company: There will never be a better time to capitalize on your rights to produce and release this classic video. Whoever owns it, for the love of God, the time to re-release ""X: The Unheard Music"" is NOW!"
4,Helpful and Well Done,"This DVD provided a really pleasant surprise. Though a bit dated insofar as lodging and restaurants are concerned, it included excellent footage of some great tarpon fishing and very helpful educational material on fly fishing for these great fish in the Florida Keys. I recommend it highly to anyone interested in the silver king on a fly rod. The 4 star rating is only because it is dated insofar as lodging, tackle shops and restaurants are concerned. Otherwise, it is a very enjoyable 5 star in my book."
5,John Ford's Best!,"Maybe these aren't all of his best, but they are certainly among his very best. For anyone who thinks John Ford only made westerns with John Wayne, check out ""My Darling Clementine"" with Henry Fonda. This is MY favorite western and i think it's a perfect film."
4,Home Handyman Quality and Price,"A decent enough ratcheting screwdriver for occasional use. This driver is light in weight, which some users may find a plus. Be prepared to buy extra bits, as it doesn't come with many. Stanley's 68-010 driver is ""contractor grade"" at a few dollars more. The latter is heavier in weight and duty cycle, but it is awkwardly long."
2,Musical Theatre?,"There are some nice songs to listen to, but if you are looking for a fresh new musical theatre CD - this is not it."
3,Pleasing to the ears,"While i love musicals in mostly all shapes in form, plus this is no exception. The vocal work in every one of the cast is immense. The plot does taper off rather quickly and by the time you have got half way through the album, personally i lost interest in what was happening..The only way i was retained to listen to it, was the songs and the voices.While its a lovely story of how the production came into play, there does seem to be something missing, whatever that is?"
1,no lyrics,"wow-the lyrics to this show are so corny and predictable! No beautiful poetic surprises, no sophistication or imagination in the lyrics. I could predict the next lyric in more than half I listened to. I am so wowed by all of our brilliant modern music theatre composers but this one is very disappointing."
4,Computer Amateur,XFX 650i is a beautiful mobo but I can not overclock highly as I want with my Intel E6400.
3,Not perfect but..,Cheap ends that on some of the smaller ones have already broke. I like the fact that the handles are long but if you need some leverage they twist pretty easy.
4,They do the job just fine!,There's nothing fancy about these wrenches. They fit the right sized bolt heads and work great in low torque applications. In high torque applications these would probably twist around themselves.
4,Works No Complaints made in China.,"Nice rubber coated T-handles, functional snap close plastic storage bag, haven't put any stress on them so the quality of steel is unknown but they have functioned for everything we have put them to here in our office. I would consider purchasing something similar for my shop at home."
4,Price Can Be Beat.....,"I brought this camera this year at a thrift store. Don't remember the exact price,but, between $20.00 and $25.00.Included the mfg's box and all items listed as in the box. It's a good camera, but, DON'T pay the full price for onethis old. Hit the thrift stores, lot's of old but good stuff around. IE: A Pentax K1000 with a f:1.1/4 mfg prime lens,50 mm for 48.00 and change. One of the Made in Japan models, not China. Built like a truck.PS: Digital cameras, point and shoot usually come out with new models twice a year. No need to ever pay full price."
3,This is my 4th camera..,"I don'tknow why people give 5 stars here..Problems:Problems starts when I was at wedding party. Every one was takieng pictures but not me !The camera's focus mechanism simply does not work in low-light conditions.Poor focus mechanism. very dark pictures in low light conditions. too bright macro pictures..Of course you can always use night mode, but without tripod pictures will not satisfy you.."
4,A Wonderful Spiritual Read,"This is one of those books you can't put down. It's a very interesting account of the life of Jimmy Swaggart. It was published in the late 1970's, and will inspire you in your service to the Lord!"
5,I LOVE IT!,I think ANYONE who thinks negitive of this program is sooo wrong! I had to get this because my week old Catz3 crashed and so i thought why not get catz4! I made the right choice! it sooo cool!
3,it could have been better,the book explained from his point of view. I know that many indians have problems with abuse and alcoholism but this info was already known. It just talked on how a person learned to be a real mother and how to grow up. The only exciting points of the book were the game when the author really got into it.
4,counting coup,"I felt this book was realistic and truthful. Colton did a nice job of telling the story and as a reader, he hooked me with all the stories of different character. I didnt view this book as looking down on indians, rather just telling the true story of what happens on the rez. He dosent protray all indians to be achoholics, just that many indians on a rez are. He puts no cushion around the lining of the story; just tells the story of Sharon and her life as an athlete, friend, and granddaughter. He tells the story, just like it unfolds."
3,Be Careful Welsing.,"I find some of Welsing's theories a combination of half-baked truths, guess-work, and dangerous concoctions. But at the same time, I must say it was a fun read. Some of the stuff is true, but I wouldn't base racism (white supremacy) on the fact that whites have little or no melanin, as Welsing claims. I think racism is a product of thousands of years of culture and revolutions. I could spend the whole day talking. Oh well...everyone has an opinion."
1,Antagonistic Book,"While this book did have some interesting thoughts, most of the theories were thoroughly ridiculous in my opinion. It seemed as though her ideas of making herself and others feel better about themselves was only to put others down. When I first began reading it I started to become very angry and attacked but then I realized that it is really only one person's opinion and her ""proof"" was not research based. Anyone can look back and take other people's opinions or events and make them into something to prove what they believe to be true. But some of her ideas were thought provoking but really only if taken in small doses."
1,"not worth the money, time or effort","after making 14 t-shirts for my sons hockey team, the shirts all peeled and cracked after being washed ( in cold water) i was very disappointed with this paper i have always used avery, and i tell you i will go back to avery, i now have 14 shirts that were not very cheap that i can use for rags i can't give these shirts to the team now,,, i wouldn't bother spending my money on this product"
1,Terrible Experience,"I ordered the pink corvette for my two daughters (2 and 6 yrs old) for Christmas. On Christmas the girls were excited to see the car and jumped in to take it for a spin. The car made it about 10 feet and stopped. Battery had been charged 16 hours as per the directions. The car never worked properly. I called Safety First, who sent me another car, which I assembled and charged the battery for 16 hours. The girls (excited again about their new toy) jumped in and it made it about 10 feet and stopped. After several calls to Safety First and jumping through many hoops they had a parcel delivery service pick up both cars and sent me my money (almost $400) back. The only good point is that the employees at Safety First were very helpful and polite but the product is inferior quality."
2,Not needed,"Thought this would work with teething since he likes blankets, but no dice. It was too small to be cuddly, and he liked the sounds it made but not for that long. Didn't work for us."
1,Cloak of Deception-Excellent Title,"This has to be the worst star wars book I have read other than the young jedi knights. This book is slow, boring, very little action, poor hero development, Oh yes did I mention BORING! A real waste of $... dollars. Even in paperback it would be to expensive. Back to stackpole for a good read."
1,Utterly Horrible...,"...almost like my spelling.The WORST Star Wars book I have ever read!Boring, it draggs alot.It would of put me to sleep if I wasn't hiped up on caffeine.It belongs in the dollar bin!"
1,Terrible,Not a great book. Could only get halfway through and I gave up. Glad I checked it out from the library or I would have wasted my money.
5,Great history,"This is one of those books that gives great insight into the background stories of the movies. If you like stories that closely relate to the movies, you'll enjoy this book. It gives some background on the relationsship with Sidious and the Trade Federation as well as how Palpatine manouvers in the senate to position himself to be the runner up to Valorum as supreme chancellor. I don't have the money or time to obtain and read every SW book or graphic novel. So if this sounds like you, I would say this is one of the SW books I would read. I would also highly recommend Labrynth of Evil, also by James Luceno for the same reasons I reccommend this book."
5,One word...,"One word, and one word only...EXCELLENT. This show is not only entertaining, but fairly accurate. I know this because I'm a military buff, an intelligence buff, and a history/political science buff. Yes, there are SOME flaws in it. But that's only because of Government approval.Dennis Hopper and Benjamin Bratt play army Spec Op officers in the pentagon. Their mission is to launch and assist Special Forces Missions around the world. They have to bypass legal and political matters in the process.Watch this at least once. Trust me, you won't regret it."
4,Can't Wait!,"I hope the producers put it to DVD this year- I really enjoyed the show-Please let me know once it is available-Thanks,SincerelyYour friends on Guam!"
5,Beautiful Red!,"I was unsure of the color from the picture because to me it looked a little orangish. I just painted my nails and it is a deep, candy apple red. It is a beautiful color and goes on thick. I haven't had it on long enought to comment on whether it chips easily or not but I use the start to finish base/top coat so my color usually stays on for a few days without chipping at all."
2,review,"I read this book and it didn't really teach me anything new that I didn't already know. The only thing that stood out to me is something the author suggested that I definitely do not agree with- that you let toddlers of equal size and strength battle it out for toys. Think about it... I found the book ""How to raise an unspoiled child"" much more helpful and respect the authors approach and credibility."
5,much to enjoy and appreciate here,"Kemp Tolley was an attache to the Soviet Navy during WWII. He wrote this book during the late Cold War, which makes its general fairness all the more impressive. Don't be fooled by the title, which sounds like some sort of role-playing game--this is a keeper.There are numerous funny stories in this book. Tolley, who spoke (perhaps present tense; word is he's still around) fluent Russian and adapted to Russian culture rather than attempting to bend it into something Americanesque, genuinely liked the people of Russia. He has done a fine job of separating this from his views on the Soviet political system, giving us a very fair portrayal of Russians (and to a lesser degree other USSR ethnic groups).This would be a fine read for anyone planning to visit Russia. While the politics have changed a lot, the culture has changed far less, and this book would help the visitor to appreciate it."
4,Strong Whodunnit that the Reader Can Enjoyable Solve,"Very quickly: This is what you might get if you successfully mixed James Ellroy (""L.A. Confidential"") and John Grisham (""The Firm""). It's a neat, gritty, intricate piece of mystery about a lawyer who really wants to believe his client didn't commit the murder. He's pretty sure she didn't... pretty sure...I liked this one because I figured out the killer's identity, but only after reading nearly the whole thing, and after giving it lots of thought. To me, that's the best kind of mystery. It's not as violent as Ellroy, nor as austere as Grisham, but it has the feel of the better parts of both those writers, blending hard facts about the crime and those it affects with slick law-practice maneuvering. Good fun."
4,Fun action-packed movie!,"This movie has it all. Action, suspense and angry Incas! The twist at the end is just an added bonus! Nothing to be taken seriously but entertaining none the less."
3,it's ok,overall the CD is just ok. a little repetitive. if you liked the Everything is Illuminated movie I suggest you buy the soundtrack since Gypsy Punks is featured and has the best songs on the soundtrack.
5,gogol bordello is awesome,good for any occasion its just an astounding diaspora of cultural sound. I would recommend it to anyone.
3,This is confusing!,"I read all your reviews and they are so extreme either way! Are we talking about the same book, same edition???? (Check the ISBN and copyright date)"
3,Bunch of Crap,It was not a good book cause it actually skipped alot of important stuff that a student should know before taking exam. I would'nt reccomend this book to beginners.
4,"This one's great, but where'sJazz Goes to Junior College?","This album hardly needs a review for anyone who knows the output of Brubeck and company. It's great, top to bottom. I submit this, really, in hopes that someone will heed a call for reissue of an even greater album - Brubeck's Jazz Goes to Junior College. For years I have periodically checked for a CD reissue of that one, my all-time favorite of the quartet. What will it take to have that happen? RKC"
2,Just Not Amusing or Interesting,"I wanted to love, or at least like this book, but I just couldn't. In the author's defense, I read her book right after reading Haven Kimmel's books and the latter's books are so incredibly witty that I laughed out loud through them--not so with S.A.H.M I Am. The humor in this book made me wince because I knew the author was really trying, and I was rooting for her, but she just was not funny. I also just completed the Happy Housewife by Darla Shine and I laughed and cried through that whole book, so I think that spoiled me for S.A.H.M I Am.Maybe lots of mothers will see themselves in this book, but I am not amused by not cleaning your house. Maybe when you have a newborn, but not after that. Sitting at the computer is a luxury enjoyed AFTER the work is done.Finally, I was hoping for lots of info about living in Germany (because of the title), but that was scarce. This read more like a journal and may be interesting to some people, but I was hoping for more."
3,Frustrating,"One of my favourite television series made less enjoyable by the studio's striving to save pennies while sacrificing quality. Discs are double sided and therefore more easily subject to damage than the more common single sided discs. And, as another reviewer noted, damaged discs with episodes that will not play are a problem in more than one season.Out of the many hundreds of DVDs that I have watched, never have I encountered a series set with so many problems. The fact that the problems are not resolved by replacing the discs strongly suggests a production problem. What a shame that the studio could not have been more concerned with quality. Perhaps they will release a new and improved set at some point in the future. Until then QL fans and those just discovering this wonderful and original show will have to put up with faulty product."
3,For those who don't have boogie fever,"Back in the 1970s when John Travota was strutting his stuff in the movie Saturday Night Fever and the mirrored ball spun in disco's all over America, there was the popular expression, ""Disco Sucks."" IMO there were some positively awful disco songs, but some great funky dance numbers as well. If you don't live in a boogie wonderland and disco doesn't light your sepentine fire or shake your groove thang, this sticker's for you. Slap it on your vehicle or your brick house. :-)"
3,Nice Looking But for Light Duty Storage Only,"I originally ordered this unit for storing accessory plastic items such as my wet-dry vac & air blower attchements. The first shipment to arrive was hopelessly damaged with a large crack on the top and a hole through the side. Item was damaged even though the box showed no signs of damage. I requested a return shipping label and a replacement shipment. The second unit arrived a few days ago and was OK. Apparantly, the first box was missing a protective carboard liner that came with the 2nd shipment. This may explain why the first unit arrived damaged. Details:Pro's: Nice Appearance, Composite/Plastic will not Rust, Rather Lightweight, Opens & Closes without BindingCon's: Not Suitable for Heavy Items Inside or on Top, Thin Walled on SidesOverall, a nice unit for storing lightweight items in closed drawers. Please check closely for damage upon receiving."
3,"Not Their Best, But Good","The album cover scares people away. It's obvious why. I was a huge DOA back in the mid 80's, and was eager to hear ""Nude"". When I picked it up, I was somewhat disappointed. There are some strong dance tracks on the album, but as a whole, the album is not nearly as strong as their previous efforts. Tracks that stand out are ""Turn Around And Count 2 Ten"", ""Come Home With Me Baby"" and ""I Cannot Carry On""."
4,Dont be Afraid to Listen to it in PUBLIC !!! Dont be a Wimp,This Album Is Fast and Fun and Not Only Good for Aerobics like another Brain dead Reviewer stated !!! It is the Kind of album you can slightly Reflect on and Enjoy for Pete Burns Brilliant Vocals !!! Leave your Aerobice tights and Leotards in the Closet for this Great album :) HA!
4,it's very good,"it's a very good album, since it mixes all phases from bathory. a bit of black metal, viking metal, deathrash, and there it goes. i recommend."
3,False advertising....,"Don't get me wrong... I love the warmth & comfort that my comforter provides me in my freezing home. What I have a problem with is that I bought this based on it's size and fabric more than it's fill power. I thought it was a 96""x96"" comforter... no, it's a 96""x92"". Also, the description states that it's cotton & silk. Now, hmmm..., last time i checked, silk is NOT polyester though it is imitated by it. I guess it's too late for a refund since I've opened it and I really need one right now, but I am very dissatisfied by the misleading descriptions on here."
2,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!,"I was a bit scared to buy a duvet, I read the reviews and said well this is a great price and it seems good enough what the heck! OMG .... I recently purchased a king size bed so my queen size duvet just wont do it anymore. WHICH I AM NOT TOO SAD ABOUT .. this duvet leaks everywhere!!! They get all over my boyfriend's shirt while he sleeps, he wakes up sneezing its horrible! I was pleased at first ive had this duvet for a yr I only dry clean it about every 3 months, I wash the Duvet cover once a week. Now I am on the hunt for a new one and believe me I will not be buying this brand anymore. I do not recommend I paid 215.00 for it and the way I see it , you might as well pay the full 600.00 for a QUALITY DUVET. Overall the Duvet was warm and perfect for Miami weather still kept me warm and cool at the same time.... But when I look under my bed every 2 days... it looks like a goose died under my bed.. =("
1,Filling leaks all over the place,I ordered this based of the great reviews it recieved! After using it for a month or two we noticed the stuffing/feather dust would come right threw the outer layer of the comforter and get all over the duvet! It would get all over everything and be very hard to remove. Everything was great with it except that part. You begin to breath the fine feathers... Buy it if you want it for a few weeks. Don't buy it if you want it to last...
1,Battaglia Smaglia,"I'm a sucker for anything that has to do with WWII, but the subject can never be done justice with a low bugit production. It's great that they found a jeep and a truck but that does not equal authenticity. The silly firecracker effects and cheezy dialogue sucks you right out of the film and reminds you why certain subjects should be left to Mr. Spielberg. It's clear that the creators of this film studied Saving Private Ryan to much for their own good. It was an ok attempt, but next time they should tackle something a little more within their league and not take themselves to seriously."
1,nice try,I thought this movie was really bad..it was a good attempt thought but that missile at the end looked so fake it was funny and so did the firecrackers going off that I guess were supposed to be gun shots. I also don't get why this guy was drawing during all of this maybe I missed something..Nice try though.
3,What the?,"There's just too much going on and trying to be said within the constraints of the time limitations. In othe words, the storyline my be fine for an hour and a half movie, but it simply can't be told effectively in seven minutes.And, it's not that I don't understand what the movie maker is trying to communicate. It just took me a lot of time and effort to follow the storyline and figure out ""where is this going?"" ""what's trying to be said?"" I don't have a problem with being asked to think when watching something, but by trying to force ten pounds of peanuts into a two pound bag, what's left is a whole lot of confusion.The film maker might rightfully say, ""Well, it's a complex story and impossible to effectvely convey in seven minutes."" And, he'd be right. But, the parameters of the project are clear. If the story can't be told effectively within the guidelines of the project, come up with an outstanding story that can."
5,An Excellent Tribute.,"I might be a little biased, as I am a veteran, but this film really moved me. I turned to my girlfriend, who watched it with me, and found myself fully choked. It's a credit to the filmmaker and the actors in this short, how well the story was presented in such a limited amount of time. I don't feel like 5 stars is enough but that's all they allow. The authenticity of the uniforms as well as the vehicles shows how much the filmmakers cared about the subject matter. This film so poignantly depicts the mortal sacrifices that were made in a time when honor was a daily event, something of which we are in short supply these days. In my opinion, this contest is already over..."
2,.... sigh not again.,"Every time I have to scroll my screen down to read a review for this movie, I know it's THE DIRECTOR. PLEASE stop leaving long winded reviews for your own movie trying to justify this or that. The only thing your doing is taking up bandwith."
4,Clever spoof! Maybe too clever!,"Why is everyone reviewing this as a straight war movie when it's obviously a parody of ""Saving Private Ryan"" and other jingoistic films--and a clever parody, at that! I mean, this movie mocks absolutely every war stereotype/cliche in history: the ludicrously noble leader (hello--children out of nowhere, that was really funny and clever), ridiculous missle at the end with impeccable dramatic timing, appropriately awful dialogue, the dude absolutely ignoring the deadly fire around him just so he can draw a picture, and the cheesy guy crying about his grandfather--HILARIOUS. Four stars for a job well done! I hope other less intelligent filmmakers--you know who you are--get the point."
2,RAMINDAD MA OF TAHT MOVEI WIT ELIJAH WOD,THIS MOVEI RAMINDAD MA OF TAHT MOVEI WIT ELIJAH WOD TEH ON3 DEP IMPACT NO DA HOBIT ON3 LOL BUT IT WAS PRETY!!111!11!1!11!!!1!111!!!11!!!!1
5,Importance of History,As important now as it was then on how important individual effort is for the greater good of all. An excellent short (albiet a bit cheezy on the FX)that takes a bit of history and expands on it.
5,History,Great piece of workmanship! I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is an excellent representation of our past in WWII. The production value makes this look like a big budget feature.
5,Perfect!,"We have had these collars on our babies for about 4 years now. Previously we used the choke chains, which I did not feel good about having on my dogs, but we have one dog that easily backs out of his collar! This fixed that issue and we did away with the choke chains! Did I mention, their collars are 4 years old and still very NICE!"
3,Does not fit properly on my golden doodle,I have to make it loose and tight every time I have to put it on and off as my dogs head is larger than the adjustment provided by the small ring. And color is more like pinkish red than darker red as seen in the photo.
1,dangerous collar,"I had to cut this collar off of my puppy this afternoon. He got the center part of the collar with the ring in his mouth and as he struggled to get it out of his mouth, he choked himself making the collar so tight that I couldn't even take it off. There's no quick release and he was screaming and crying as it was strangling him. We had to hold him still so that I could cut the collar off. VERY SCARY! The collar is a gentle choke collar and a good concept, but without the quick release it is none other than hazardous."
3,USELESS -- SIZED TOO LARGE,"Collar is okay -- but WAY too big!The info about sizing this martingale collar is wrong. I have a spaniel/retreiver mix. Using the recommended sizing I ordered the large.Had to double up the adjusting strap all the way just to get it on our girl. At that point, the collar was too heavy for this 40 lb dog with a just under 16-inch neck PLUS there was an extra somewhat floppy layer just waiting to get caught when she explores in the bushes.Not worth shipping charges back. I DID then order the medium collar (which fits her fine). Wasted time & money. If in doubt, order SMALLER."
5,Best collar we've bought,I really like this collar. My dog's trainer introduced it to me and it has done wonders with getting my dog under control in the park. He used to lunge at people in his harness and now he can't without consequence. The price on Amazon is half what it was at the vet's office too.Great product!
3,it's okay................be prepared to purchase more !,"EHH...........this program is quite good, and a person who studies the entire curriculum will doubtlessly become quite adept at whichever language he chooses. The only problem is that one must be prepared to shell out a few hundred dollars more in order to buy all of the supplementary/subsequent materials. This program only offers a basic intro. You must purchase more and more cd's if you wish to continue. kinda dissapointing. I should save my money and enroll in a Berlitz course; probably cost about the same."
4,long time wearer,"I have worn these shoes for well over a year. I have gone through 3 pairs and think they are really great. Comfort, style is there. The only problem that I have is my orthodics squeak in them."
5,Awesome,"This CD is fantastic. Not a big surprise. I was thrilled to find a bunch of Brad's old songs on it, and the new ones are just as great. His songs are thoughtful and emotional, and the music and lyrics match perfectly. Buy this CD, or his other one (or both) now. It isn't a choice anyone could regret."
5,Carotid Artery Surgery,Exceptionally well written. Encompases the entire subject of carotid artery disease and intervention. It includes data in regards to both classical vascular surgical management and carotid stenting. Overall a well written comprehensive compedium of carotid arterial disease and surgical treatment.
1,Incomplete Home Video (Very Poor Quality),"This was a very disappointing video about more advanced woodburning techniques. While it's obvious that Cheryl Dow is a professional woodburner - there was nothing professional about the production of this video. This is a home video with Cheryl Dow demonstrating some ""advanced"" techniques (i.e. not for beginners). In addition to the poor sound quality and cameral operation, the most disappointing part of this video is that it ends right in the middle of her demonstration - WOW!! We could not believe it - we even checked to see if our VCR malfunctioned because it's not possible to end a video that way.In conclusion, we're extremely disappointed that this video is offered for purchase on Amazon.com. It was a waste of money."
1,Not as complete as described just by reading review,"I haven't bought this software, and I don't think I will. In order to have a complete and historical view of the Holocaust you would have to include the other ""inmates"" besides Jews. These would include: Political antogonists, Homosexuals and even more little known would be Jehovah's Witnesses. These are all included in the Holocaust Museum in DC....let's see a more complete product in software used in education of history."
4,Catholics humor is great!,I thought that this show was a riot. It really made me remember alot of things going to private ctholic schools and just the whole ideals of being a catholic. Lots of fun for everyone!
2,Nunsense,This was a very funny show but very poor quality dvd. The voices did not match their mouths when they were talking - timing very bad. Very poor quality and I wished I had purchassed this dvd elsewhere.
5,One of the great musicals on video!,"Each time I watch this video it gets funnier and funnier! Rue McClanahan shows her great comic talent as Sr. Mary Regina! She wonderfully played a slut in ""The Golden Girls"" to playing a nun! Who knew? The rest of the cast (Terri White, Christine Toy, Christine Anderson and Semina De Laurentis) are sensational! Even though Rue M. is the most famous one, each of the ladies in this production show that each of them has a terrific star quality! My recommendation for anyone who loves musical theatre is to buy this video immediately! You won't regret it!"
2,"Agree, it is out of date.","If you aren't planning a ""chapel"" wedding, but instead a church wedding it isn't much help since they don't even have a section on churches. The other disappointment was that there were only 3 official reception sites listed! Once again, unless you are planning an all inclusive type of wedding at a casino, chapel or hotel, this book isn't for you. I was expecting the book to present lots of options. The book did give us a place to start with real uncensored opinions from other couples. But I feel that a call to the Lake Tahoe Chamber of Commerce will provide you with as much and probably more up to date information as this book will."
5,Every beginning writier should read,"I have ordered quite a few books in the How to Write catagory and this one is the best. Learning to write well is trial and error but many errors can be eliminated right at the beginning by reading this book. The potential author is made aware of basic mistakes. We all tend to make these mistakes without realising and thus our M/S are rejected. A case of 'not knowing what you don't know'. However this book empowers because right from the start we will be aware, 'we know what we don't know' so that we can change or eliminate writing mistakes."
2,"Hard slogging through the ""cutes""","This book may very well have some great advice, but the author just couldn't stop with the ""cuteness"", and I'm having a hard time getting past that. I'll probably shelve it and just go back to the other authors -- authors whose books also get four and five star ratiings, and who don't feel the need to use stupid little gimmicks to keep their readers engaged."
2,Little Girl Cures The World,"Some interesting moments, but an odd choice to pick a little girl to champion. She is not someone who would play the game...certainly she couldn't see over the table. Perhaps a young lady more his age would have been appropriate. She just didn't fit the college scene.I'm afraid I couldn't get beyond the basic elements of this film. The ""Crouching Tiger"" elements were creative, but were not original."
2,Creativity is Lacking,"After reading the synopsis, I was hoping for a very original idea that could entertain me. It was disappointing to quickly learn that this was just the tired old theme of battling the devil for a soul...Charlie Daniels exchanging his fiddle of gold for a ping-pong table. I was rooting for this one, so I give it a 2. I just can't vote any higher because all other elements seemed mediocre at best. If I could give 5 stars for the synopsis, though, I would!"
2,No Influences?,Funny and entertaining. Clever. Most of the actor's acting skills match their ping pong skills. You can afford good actors on a $400 budget--most will work for free--lazy casting. Freshly derivative. But funny.
4,Be sensitive to history,"Your film is very well edited. It created the mood, the absurdity, and the surprise. Camera work is also good. The story is good, very clean and clear. The tone is a bit too serious to be a comedy. This is hard since comedians are hard to come by. Overall, very good.One point in your self description: pingpong is one of the most popular sports in China. So, do not say it is the least appreciated sport in history. Please specify you mean U.S. history."
3,good math book,Used it for the teas test. Really helped although I think I next time I would go for somthing a bit more specific
4,obsessed Again!!,"the green sisters return with thier 2nd disc Sweet Obsession Too. The vocal harmony is killer, and most evident on the slower tracks, the last 5 to be exact. stand out tracks are the first single uptempo ""elevator"", female empowerment track ""i depend on me"",senusal slow jams ""it tortures me""""give me all my love back""and""secret society of love"" my absolute favorite is ""i want to know"" a beatifully haunting track. however the fan favorite is ""i'm a good woman looking for a good man"" they really put thier soul into this song.. not to many people sing like this anymore you feel the passion in every word they sing.."
5,SIMPLIE PUT.....,"IT'S THERE BEST WORK EVER, ALSO everything up to Hordes is killer too,Don't believe me, hear it for yourself.If you can handle it.Not for the weak minded metalhead.For me it's Hardcore heavy thrash music all the way.It's the only way to keep it real and learn from. Its the bands cool vibe.In what there playing and singing about. In a fake world that plays with your mind to makes you think that,there way is the right way is wrong.A person needs to be a free thinker in music. What there force feeding us today is crap.Go out,find and dig deeper for the real music world at hand.Believe in your own music and what it means to you!Who cares what anybody else thinks.Check this band out, there really cool.Amazing to see live!!!Peaceandmetal"
4,Interesting concept,"This was a fun book for me to read. I don't want to post spoilers here, but there are some interesting twists involving the main characters that play a big part of the plot down the road.The author does a very good job of moving this story along with the right mix of action, details and setting descriptions. Also, some of the things the author adds are rather unconventional and therefore makes the book very interesting. He tends to go against the grain in a couple of areas, and for that I applaud the author.This is not the type of book that you see rehashed and rehashed over and over again, this is something new and interesting. Give it a shot if you are a fan of the Forgotten Realms."
3,Odd Mix,"How unusual to mix a bunch of bands that are mostly gone with a few still around like Mind Static Butterfly Messiah and Grim Faeries.The standouts are those that are still together particularly Butterfly and Mind Static. Everyone raves about Grim Faeries, but I never have seen the attraction. Marilyn Manson [copies] with a faerie schtick. I was bored before I even began.And what's with all the metal bands? Florida was all about metal in 1992. And 1982. Cleopatra knows how to put compilasions together."
2,Not for beginners,"This is not a book for beginners. It is too full of mistakes, contradictions and academic hubris to rely on. The copy editor of this work should be boiled in oil. For example - the glyph for lasso is called a brazier. Albeit, some of the phrases are of value and the pictures are first-rate.On page 127, an inscription is shown and the author berates the long-dead scribe for having done it 'improperly'! Great heavenly days!Intermediate and advanced students of ME will delight in testing their knowledge by conducting a mistake 'treasure hunt'. But others should look elsewhere."
5,Excellent Shampoo,"Ojon Ultra Hydating Shampoo is great for African American hair. It doesn't strip your hair of nature oils and yet your hair feels clean. After using the shampoo, my hair isn't tangled or dry. I love this shampoo and it's the only one I will ever use."
2,"Ok, but there is better books","This was my first for dummies book (and will be the last). Some information is ok, but there is better books out there. In another words, do not waste your money"
5,GREAT,My fiance is an entomologist and she absolutely loved this gift. I would buy it again if I had it to do all over.
5,The BEST book on transexuality,"To understand if one is transexual this book is a must. I cried all the way through it. Kept saying ""that's me exactly"". After reading it, I gave it to my GP who I'd confided in. I couldn't expect him to make head or tails of my labwork without knowing about my hormone regimen.Micha"
3,Good Place To Start,"While there are several things about this book that disappoint me, specifically the author's apparent inability to call a person by their proper pronouns or names and the idea that people who were abused are not/cannot be transsexual, it's a good place to start as long as you keep in mind that basing your entire opinion on a subject based on the views in ONE book is NOT a good idea.The book is fairly easy to read, can have it's shining moments and can be a great help to both transsexual and their family and friends alike. It shouldn't be shunned, but it also shouldn't be taken as the Gospel Truth-- it's not, but that doesn't automatically make it worthless.I would recommend ""Trans Forming Families"" (I forget the author) over this book, but as a resource, True Selves is still useful. It's a well-meaning book, despite it's (few, but glaringly obvious) flaws, and in my opinion, at least the author's didn't make transsexuals out to be psychotic freaks of nature."
4,Oh Criminal Where Art Thou,"This still stands as T Bone's most recent solo effort, which makes it puzzling that the record label hasn't reissued it--especially in light of his recent brush with fame due to ""O Brother Where Art Thou."" I'd rate this album as very solid, with my only reservation being that it doesn't sustain that lovely folk sound (featuring Mark O'Connor and Jerry Douglas) the same way his self-titled eighties effort did. But it's got at least five Burnett classics, I'd say, and among them are ""Every Little Thing,"" ""Tear This Building Down"" and ""Any Time at All."" ""Humans From Earth"" is truly scathing, but I prefer the more stripped-down version on the ""Until the End of the World"" soundtrack. Try to find this one."
5,Off the shelf,"Like some of the other reviewers, I pull this cd off the shelf every now and again and ask ""Why don't I play this more often?"" It's a great cd - my favorite one from T-Bone. I think it much better than the more recent True False Identity for example. Muscianship is great as are the tunes. If you see it cheap - get it - you'll be happy you did..."
5,A Lively Travelogue,"This book accompanying the TV series DVD is a beautiful account which I enjoyed thoroughly.The author's journey along the crest of the Himalaya, eastward starting from Khyber Pass on the Afghan-Pak border, through India and Nepal, into the Tibetan plateau, then onto India's Northeast Frontier and finally down into the Ganga-Brahmaputra delta in Bangladesh definitely calls for a look at this interesting part of the globe.The book is embellished with amazing photographs which capture not only the grand landscape but also the life and spirit of the land. Palin and his team have done well in connecting with the people, which to me was one of the highlights of the book.And if you like a sprinkling of British humour, Michael Palin will surely add more than a smile to your countenance."
4,Excellent but...,The work is an important one but this only edition available was singularily overpriced (in India it costs a mere 195 Rupees) and this edition is further marred by bad illustrations which do not do justice to the text. I have indeed alreday recommended it to several people inntested in this magnificent tradition.
3,"com""YULE""ation Cleric : Sistern Begotten Then Made","I like the gathering of contemporary Christian women artists to proclaim the faith in the mystery of the incarration and hope to be found in a baby's cry.Throughout this record there is originality, unfortunately the cacophony of full orchestration and over production muddles this modern-millennial-mirth-makers vocal talent. Portraying The Simple Truth is best begotten with less accompaniment,thus echoing more clearly in the hearts it it meant to touch. Merrily Mix 2,3,4,6,7,8,10,and 11 just undo some intros and fades. Post Script~ Good that could have been Great,please give it another go.***buyit*savemost*sharemost*giveit*donateit***"
4,"nicely structured, very user friendly","My CD-Rom does include the japanese lessons. I find this product extremely accessible and very nicely structured. The lessons progress in easily understandable segments. For me, it is an ideal way to start learning a new language, as you always have a reference between pictures, the written, and the spoken words. My only criticism is that I would prefer some grammatical explanations, especially for chinese and japanese."
3,NOT for serious language learning,"Excellent, easy-to-use interface creates a fun environment for an introduction to seven languages. But do not expect to reach any level of fluency because there just isn't enough material for any one language.I would buy this package simply to see if Rosetta Stone style of learning (use of pictures while hearing the words for the object in the picture) would be appropriate for you. You can't go wrong if your expectations are low."
2,Let Down,"If you are a fan of Mr. Marr's extraordinary playing on any of the smiths albums, this album is not for you. I grew up with his unique and melodic phrasing, and couldn't await the release of his new album...He does not sound like the same guitar player. These songs are predictable with a flat-line delivery. A bit of electronicapercussion and the same sort of flange effect on his voice, on every song gets old. I'm sorry Johnny, you will forever be my favorite guitar player but this new album represents nothing of your days gone by, regretfully."
3,"10 years ago, maybe ...","Like one or two reviewers on this page, I'd hoped that Johnny Marr would deliver something inspirational and new for his first solo effort, especially after all of this time. Unfortunately, half decent is all we got.If the man had produced this album in the early nineties, it would have been a creditable effort -- influential perhaps. But since those days, acts like the Stone Roses, Primal Scream and a fist full of others have pioneered, developed and since abandoned the sound that Mr. Marr peddles today. The production is great, the guitar skills honed, but the songs could do with a little more immagination.This isn't a bad album, just not near what you would expect from a man whose talent, originality and dscography inspired a decade's worth of shoe gazing outfits.In short, this boomslang lacks venom and bite."
5,Reliable and very convenient,I took this converter to a very long European trip. It worked just fine. My family members were using it for both high-wattage and low-wattage appliances. It was very handy to have a single converter for all cases. What can I say - it worked as supposed and didn't break. The set of 5 different adapters (all types used on the planet) was very handy too.
3,wors not well (?),"I only used it in Japan, where the voltage is very close to that in US. It didn't charge my laptop when I plug in. In the end I plug in the local socket directly. I didn't try other things and my laptop's battery does have some problems. So I am not sure if the product was malfunctioned or not.One certain drawback is that it is heavy."
1,Blown fuse,"I purchased this product for a trip to Germany. When I arrived I went to use it and it wouldn't work. I pulled it apart, which revealed a blown ACG style fuse. But its not just any fuse it s a super micro teeny tiny one. So now my small amount of personal time on a work trip was occupied by tracking down an electronics repair shop to get the fuse.Otherwise the product is fine, once the fuse was replaced it worked as needed.Thanks for weird story to tell everyone when I got back."
5,"Very Nice Travel Package, works well","While it's a bit hefty in its box, I take only the adapters I'll need. Weight aside, the wife and I have used these adapters in Europe, England, Scotland (6 countries in all); it has worked perfectly for two years and lots of travel. Used it for everything from digital cameras to electic shavers and cell phones."
2,Voltage Converter,The converter worked fine until it fell out of the wall socket onto the floor which was about 12 inches. From that point on it stopped working.
5,It does the job,"I've had my converter for a year now, with no problems. For one thing, all converters are heavy....they are transformers. You should see the step-up transformer I have now to convert 110 to 220 !! I bought my recoton before I ever had the chance to read the reviews, or I may never have bought it in the first place. I did not get a dud like other buyers. It does the job. Just remember to watch the wattage settings for the device you are using. If not, you'll fry one thing or another. Usually the more expensive one."
5,Great adventure!,"This serie is about four teenagers and a dog who encounter adventures everywhere they go. It is the ultimate teen fantasy because these guys are on their own under the permission of their parents, traveling through England on their summer vacations, staying in cool places (such as castles, mansions, farms, open country, deserted islands, etc.) while defeating bandits and thiefs. The personalities of each character are very defined and the guest characters are equally awesome. It is a great light reading and an encouraging book to make children and teenagers read."
1,Punk?,"Hey I'm a dedicated AC/DC fan, and i know a thing or two about them. And i happen to know that AC/DC hated punk bands. As Angus Young was once asked if he had any sympathy for punk bands, he replied (and i quote), ""none."" They hated punk bands, and i can't blame them, 'rock n' roll will survive' after all.Ride On"
3,Helpful but flawed...,"My wife received the Puff 'n Stuff Auto Litterbag this year for Christmas, and she was delighted to finally have a place to dispose of trash in the car, rather than the plastic grocery bag that we have traditionally attached to the gearshift. Overall, this auto litterbag has been helpful, as we now have a good place for trash. Its location hanging over the back of the front seat allows it to occupy no functional space. Its leakproof nature has been helpful. However, we have been very disappointed with the tissue dispenser, as the orientation of the tissue box allows every tissue to rip as we try to pull it from the box. So, that function of the Puff 'n Stuff has been lost to us. If they fixed the tissue problem, I'd be happy to recommend this item without hesitation. As it is, we still appreciate the litterbag."
3,edges fraying,I like the concept of this organizer but the quality isn't great. The fabric edges are already fraying after only a month or so of use.
1,wasted my money,Before buying this product make sure your printer is compatiable. I have a new HP photosmart and it does not work with this product. Five hours later I still do not have an album and have only one sheet left. I have used a full ink cartridge trying to get this right.
5,Pulsar Swarovsky Crystal Watch,"I thought this watch looked so pretty in the photo but it's even prettier in person. It is very classy looking; not overdone but very fancy with the Swarovsky crystals; even the side view has crystals which doesn't show in the picture. It fits the wrist very nicely and you can adjust the links in the band to fit a small wrist. Shipping was very fast. Also, it does keep accurate time. I highly recommend this watch. Valerie"
3,Fine but a bit noisy,"Ah, the fun of a disco ball. Seriously, you cannot have a bad day if you come home, dim the lights, and put the spotlight on your disco ball. And it's even better when the ball spins. This little motor is ok, but a bit noisy. Solution? Turn up the music, I suppose!"
1,Do you like it loud and fast?,"Way too fast... way too loud.I got this for a disco ball. Forget it!It spins so fast, the little dots of light speed across the wall and make you feel dizzy.It's so loud too!Even if you got it nice and slow, so you can turn it on during the 'slow jams' for effect... you'd have to bump up the volume to cover the grinding gear sound... Who want's to dance to super LOUD slow jams? No one! that's who :)Maybe this is ok for outside and those wind chime thingys, but NO GOOD FOR DISCO BALLS!"
2,"Not what is pictured, similar, but different","Works fine for my 8 inch disco ball, but this is not EXCATLY what is pictured. Granted the image says something to that effect, but the one I ordered here (on Amazon) says it is made by ""VEI"", but the one I received was made by ""Amscan"" and the box says ""Spinning Motor"". It is the same type of product, but the one in the picture looks like it is one black solid unit top to bottom, but the one I got has a gap between the top of the unit and bottom of the unit. Both are black though. Not a big deal, but annoying that that it is not the same brand and one pictured."
1,not good,"received product broken. pretty flimsy. Packaging was not sturdy either. It says it can hold a 20 inch ball, but I'm not sure about that. Either way i never found out since it was broken. Ordered a new one from a different website and it works great. Would not recommend this item."
3,this is good,"I enjoy listening to this band very much. The vocals are nice, the guitar playing is solid, and the musicianship is very good as well."
2,Thanks,"The strings did not have thread at the top, that's what I was expecting and what I needed... Oh well."
4,"cow is bad for you, me, and the planet","This is a well-told personal tale of why beef is bad for you, me, and the planet. This is an easy, honest read. I highly recommend this to anyone who suspects that the typical American hamburger diet might be less than ideal. I do have a couple of reservations. First, at some point the author was quite overweight and then got better. Let's remember that we are diet and exercise. Obesity can't be blamed on any particular food; obesity is the result of lifestyle. Second, the author's good intentions occasionally lead to silly generalizations. But in general, the target message is well researched and well told."
2,For beginners only!,"while i was extemely anxious to read this book, i found out that in two chapters i was reading a dummies guide to environmentalism/vegetarianism. i have been vegetarian for many years and vegan for many as well. i picked this book up thinking it might have a little more insight on the gentleman writing the book. it did not. in fact i believe there were only two chapters devoted to why he did what he did. it seemed like more of an overview than an expose. the writing seemed a little sophmoric and generic. if you have ever read a book about becoming a vegetarian or vegan, then you have already read this book. i think what bothered me most, was that he devoted almost an entire chapter to ""the zone diet."" it felt a little preachy at the end and a little rushed. i guess it doesn't help that i don't appreciate oprah's work either."
4,health & environmental reasons to go veggie,"A good overview/reminder of the health and environmental reasons to go vegetarian. If you want to know these things but can't face disturbing chapters about slaughterhouses and animal suffering, this is the book for you (although those are important issues as well!)."
1,agony from start to finish,"I was expecting a lot from this trilogy, but I found the story stretched beyond measure to fill up 3 books, the characterization very flawed (how could Mrs Q not realize that her son was in danger until the last minute??, that's just an example), and the interaction between characters very poor. The Enterprise crew was just there to play host but to what? The Q family was more like a weird offshot of the Addams family than a group of omnipotent beings. It was all played for laughs and the ending was more of a relief than a letdown simply because by that time I had grown tired of the whole thing and glad that it was finally over. What a charade! Thumbs definitely down."
4,Finally! We find out about Q's past.,I really enjoyed this book. I often wondered how Q got to be the way he is when all the other Q are so stiff-necked. The book explained alot and the crew having to deal with the female Q and baby q is great. Having already read the second volume as well I can assure it only gets better.
5,Begin of the best Q-Adventure!,"This is leading up to what I think is going to be the best Q-Story ever. The story draws Picard on an adventure, unwillingly taken by Q, to see Q's past and how he became who he is. (You can blame 0 for it!) A very entertaining story, two of it's NON-Q bonus is that it takes place of the Enterprise-E. Also they have the new security officer Lt. Baeta Leyoro. Great story, from reading the first two chapters of part 2, I think it will be getting better and better."
2,Great movie poor quality!,Grew up on Abbot and Costello and could help myself. I enjoyed this movie growing up and wanted to share it with my son. Down side is the video quality is grainy and seems to be captured off of an old VHS copy. I have picked up a few B&W and Technicolor films on DVD that were great. This was just not worth it. Suppose I'll be keeping an eye for remastered oldies for now on.
4,Happy Customer says:,"I received my order shortly after my purchase (just in time for Christmas) I was thrilled! The CD case was broken inside, but it was no big deal to find another case. Cd was in promised condition, my husband has been enjoying it everyday. Thank you!"
4,Great for beginners,"Like most other reviews, I have to say that this is a great program for learning basic spanish and developing word and grammar association. My only complaint is that in the ""speaking"" section I couldn't get pass the red area of the bar and my girlfriend, who is from Argentina, couldn't get pass mid-yellow. Aside from that, the program was very helpful during my begining studies of spanish."
2,Ultimate?,"How can this be the ""Ultimate Collection"" of Michael Murphey without ""South Canadian River Song""? Or ""Alleys of Austin"" and ""Blessing in Disguise""? Thank goodness ""Geronimo's Cadillac"" and ""Boy from the Country"" made it on the album. Why isn't ""Cosmic Cowboy Souvenir"" available? It's a great album that deserves to be available for those who have not had the pleasure of hearing heartfelt music from one of Austin's best."
5,All of 3M's best music on one album!!!,"Wow - this album has all his best music! From the Lewis and Clark Expedition to his rendition of Jesse Winchester's ""I'm Gonna Miss You, Girl"", every song sounds fantastic. The quality of sound is excellent and the selection really shows 3M's ability to write just about every kind of music out there. In hearing some of the old songs, it made me wish that his record companies would reissue all of his albums on CD...Because I am certain that he has other great songs on those earlier albums that need to be heard. If you want an album that is 5-star from first to last, this is it!!!"
5,They work!,Bought these w/ a Boss Amp. Seems like the installers had no problem w/ the gauge's fits and sounds good!
1,bad product discription,"They call me after i left bad feedback about their worthless product. They said they have refunded my money and asked me to change my feedback.After a week they still HAVE NOT refunded my money but that don't change the fact their product IS NOT what they claim it to be. ALL of the gauge sizes they give you is the size of the insulation not the wire inside. For example the 4 gauge amp wire is actually a 12 gauge wire with a 4 gauge insulation and the speaker wire, well it's a total joke!!Wal-Mart sells a better install kit than this!!Thanks for readingDiscussed"
5,good enough,"I thought this wire package was very useful, had everything u need liked the hight quilty rca jacks that came with it, all in all wire is wire.."
2,CHEAP PRICE FOR CHEAP PRODUCT,There is a good reason why this is so cheap compared to other wiring kits. It is cheap wire. It breaks if it bends too far. Only buy this if really can't afford to get anything better.
1,"NOT 8 AWG, more like 12, Scoche brand from Walmart is so much better!!","Only suitable for a 100 watt RMS amplier at 20' length. Also the wire insulation is really poor quality and I read other reviews saying the RCA connectors would break off in your amplifier, Do not waste your time. I waited for this kit to come only to go buy a Scosche 8 AWG kit from walmart at the last minute which is true 8 AWG with much better quality materials except the crappy RCA cables."
3,Great deal for a small price,I purchased this amp kit for a small stereo that was to be installed. The kit is very complete but it'snot 8 gauge like advertised. This kit will get the job done for a low watt system but get the 4g kit if you are running over 200 watts.
1,Sucks,These wires are complete trash i would have took these wires out if the people who hooked it up said it was too late to take them out since they spent that time wiring them in. they dont even provide that much wattage to run/flow through them. please spend a little more money and get another wire kit. it got one star because they work
3,Good for price,"The price was right for me, but I would recommend shelling out a little more for a wiring kit.The gold plating on one of the RCA cables fell/got pulled off somehow when plugging/unplugging them from my amp."
4,Good deal for the price,"This is a nice, complete set for a lowe price. The power and ground cables seem to be the weak links - not quite 8 guage as many have suggested. The interconnects seem to be rather good quality though. I did not use the speaker cable that came with the set."
2,One word... CRAP,"This kit is a COMPLETE FRAUD! everything in this kit is NOT true to their gauge. BOSS should be sued or something for this... I'll just leave it as that... can't say anymore to this PoS... the only good thing is that I have a current use for it, hence the two stars (should be negative stars)... but not for audio... I wouldn't even recommend it for audio... NOT RECOMMENDED! PERIOD!!!"
2,RCA Cables are the worst.,"The fuse is decent, the power cable works good, and they supply you with all of the connectors you might need. These are the worst RCA Cables ever made, though. The first time you try to take them out, they'll break on you. One of them broke inside the amp and I still haven't figured out how to get it out. IF you buy it, don't use those RCAs!!!!!"
4,nice buy,the really good weirs thick and long its a good price for this product buy it you wont be disappointed
3,very small wires dont buy,i shouldve listened to the reviews. i usually don't make reviews. this far from a 8 gauge a true 8 gauge wire doesn't even fit in the actual fuse for the battery to amp. go to your local home depot for wires and best buy for your wire fuse i had to make it work but had to replace speaker wire and ground wire with home audio wires.The input wires were fine though
2,Sigh... Waste of Everyone's Time,"I'd just like to apologize to Amazon, the postman, and everyone that help receive my order and ship it to me. Sorry for wasting your time. I should've listened to the other critical reviews of this product, but I decided to give it a go.Will it make your amplifier run? Yep. But it's not 8 gauge. Not even close. The power wire is like a thick piece of delicious licorice with a copper thread in the center. Tons of insulation to make it look like 8 ga. from the outside.Just save yourself the trouble and check out the KnuKonceptz kit. For hardly any more money, you're getting some cables that are truly beefcake!"
1,Poorly made product.,"The problems I have with this kit,One of the ends on the rca cable broke within a week. The pin of one of them came off, rendering the cables useless. I wouldn't have even had to mess with the RCAs if the fuse that came with the kit didn't malfunction. The subs would work sometimes and sometimes they wouldn't. I finally narrowed it down to the fuse, it was blown, but the fuse would sometimes have connectivity, sometimes it wouldn't. Turns out the fuse was only soldered to one end.Don't buy.."
1,epic fail,The descrition says 8 gauge power wire but it looks more like 12 gauge.... its better used as speaker wire dont waste your money. If your serious about amping up your system spend the extra money and get a true amp wiring kit
1,Junk for even $12!,"I bought this kit thinking it would be 8 gauge only to find that the outside diameter of the wire is 8GA and the wire itself is only 10 or 12GA. Do not power big amps with this thing it will set your car on fire!!!!. The RCA's are also jusk and are very loose when plugged in. If you have a 50W or a 100W amp you would like to power this will be just fine but carefull, this is not made for more than about 20A system. I know I only paid $12 or so for this so I kinda expected it to be bad but not this bad!!!"
2,call places before you purchase!,"I was not satisfied with this purchase after finding out it was the wrong gauge for my amp in which i bought off amazon also...I am a girl...wanted to buy my boyfriend a good birthday gift. Amazon does that thing where they suggest items to buy with the items your purchasing and I saw these gauges and thought i need those! well, come to find that all the places that install sub wolfers didnt know this brand and said it could start a fire with the wolfer I got. 8 gauge is not good with 12 in sub, and make sure they are copper! Def do the research before you hit add to cart! I received them on time, so i have to give them props on that."
3,Boss KIT -2 - Does the job,It does the job. Everything needed for the installation of an amp. Good quality cables and accessories. Good presentation. Nothing out of this world.
4,Resuelve,"Resuelve, para la instalacion de su musica, y buen precio, lo puede comprar, esta bien. Su musica quedara bien y con buen sonido."
3,alright,i dont think the product is actually 8 gauge wire. little to small for 8 gauge. but it works great on my boss 1200 watt amp pushing the MTX terminator package
4,Wonderful Product,I bought this product to do my own sound system install and it was so nice to be able to purchse the whole wiring kit all in one.
5,Dancy as hell post-punk,"I'm a broke college student, so it's rare that after forking up the dough for a concert ticket I'll actually be inclined to buy the band's CD. However, I just saw these guys open for Rainer Maria in Charlottesville, VA, and I couldn't help myself. This weekend's beer money went to Hail Social for their new album and I certainly don't regret it! I listened to the album five times in a row right after I got it. The album only has 9 songs on it, but they're all great songs. If you like catchy, dancy post-punk stuff like Death From Above 1979, Bloc Party, or the Stills (all great bands) you'll like these guys too."
3,Strong Setting / Weak Story,"Headley's debut is more interesting for its portrayal of London's Jamaican immigrant criminal subculture than it's straightforward tale of the rise and fall of one hood. Basically if you've seen ""Scarface,"" you'll know the story. Headley's authentic vision of the milieu, with vivid descriptions of the role of music and food in the immigrant community, is what makes it worth reading. The thick Jamaican patois gets a little hard to follow at times, but it's no harder than ""Trainspotting,"" once you get used to it. Other than the descriptive element, the writing and plotting is extremely elementary."
5,Awesome CD-Gospel Love Ballads,"I love this Cd! It consists of mostly love songs directed towards God and displaying love for Him. I recommend this album to all who like slow, smooth gospel songs."
5,kitchenaid mixer,Works great I don't think I would of known that it was a recondtioned mixer unless I looked at the box. It works great and at half the cost of a new one.
4,"Save depreciation, buy reconditioned!","I love my 'new' KitchenAid power stand mixer. I see only one small nick in the paint where likely the original buyer had trouble getting the bowl off. This is my second RRK90WW stand mixer, this one having been purchased for our second home. My first KitchenAid mixer I bought some 15 years ago for my husband to use. Turns out, I've become the family baker! It's so much more fun to whip up goodies with a fabulous set of tools in the kitchen, and my first purchase for the second house's kitchen was this mixer."
3,Heavy,"Without doubt, this is a top notch mixer. For my use, however, it is too heavy to move about with any regularity. Difficult to work between the beaters and side of the bowl as it is a narrow space."
2,Very disappointed,"After reading many good reviews about this product, I decided to purchase the reconditioned model. I was very disappointed when I opened the box... It had many dents along the top of it, the chrome attachment where the wisk attaches to was crooked and could not be straighted out .... and the dough hook and paddle still had batter on it from the previous owner !!!! I did use it however to test it out, and the motor seemed to hesitate a little bit .. Overall, I was not satisfied and this mixer and it is on its way back to the store. I found a more powerful, larger one online and on sale for only a few dollars more with an online coupon .. and brand new... which I ordered... Hopefully it will meet my expectations."
2,Disappointing experiments,"This series of books has a major problem with the experiments. I purchased the entire set to use for home schooling, and when I started doing the experiments with my son ran into a lot of problems quickly. I took the books to a local science shop and they identified that many of the experiments were missing important components. An example: one experiment in one of the books showed how to make a battery using pennies, litmus paper and lemon juice. The battery never worked. According to the local science shop it never would work without some zinc. This was information was ommitted from the book. I found using these books to be very frustrating and wouldn't recommend them to others. However, I do have friends who like them a lot. So, I guess it is just a matter of opinion."
3,Explorer Edition,"This is the Explorer Edition of the software. It comes with 22 lesons from Rosetta Stone Level I. Level I contains 92 lessons. If you want all 92 lessons, you will need to upgrade."
4,One of the most capturing Cd's any ska band can have,"This was my first Cd ever, and out of the 300'some I now posess, it's still my favorite. It has an allure all it's own, with elements of most popular ska bands of today. The only complaints I can possibly have about it is that it lacks some of ska's musical roots. It has a stronger pop and punk background than the Reggae that some ska fans may be used to. Either way, it's an entrancing cd, it pulls you in and it'll never let go. This is one cd I'll never give up."
4,Upbeats & Beatdowns,It was a better than average album and I enjoyed it. I believe it ranks three in their best stuff.
5,"Great music, plain and simple","This is a wonderful album from an American legend. It ranks right up there with American Recordings in terms of latter-era Cash performances. If you don't get chills listening to his death-row voice trembling in defiance and fear as he approaches ""The Mercy Seat"" then you don't have hairs on the back of your neck. Just two songs later, though, the crystal-clear harmonies in ""Field of Diamonds"" will bring you to an entirely different emotional space. The covers of ""I Won't Back Down"", ""Solitary Man"", and ""One"" make you wonder how such familiar songs can be reinvented so completely and convincingly.This album is good stuff - grab it today."
3,"spotty but still, somehow, essential","This is a very strong disk with a few soft spots, both thematically and aesthetically. 9 of the 14 tunes are very strong with some almost unbelievably good songs: Solitary Man, Mary of the Wild Moor, Wayfaring Stranger--JC now owns these. Nothing more can be said about this giant's genius. The cinematic Mercy Seat is almost unbearably intense. Gorgeous. The duet w/ Merle Haggard, I'm Leaving Now just couldn't be better. But why bother covering that blowhard Bono? Has anyone not heard One before? Johnny sounds as disinterested in singing it as I am in listening to it. Also, some of the corny stuff sounds like pandering or goofing off.It seems that the space on a Johnny Cash album is so valuable that song choice is a huge decision. Rick Rubin continues to be one of the most interesting and important figures in American music with this series of disks. If anyone out there knows Rick or Johnny, try to get Johnny to sing Burning House of Love by X on the nex one."
1,Give Me A Break!,"I don't know what the people (reviewers) above me were smoking but this is a very weak and feeble sounding attempt at holding onto one thing that isn't there anymore. His voice. It comes across as being tired and old.I have always been a Cash fan but I will not be listening to this disk. This is a bomb and I am sorry to say that good old Johnny has walked the line one too many times with this latest production. It's sad, but true!Love you Mr. Cash. You were one of the best and it's time to take a well deserved rest."
4,Those Brits,The most I ever learned about British people came from Brit Coms or the ever talked about royal family.This book is entertaining and beautifully written.I liked it from the first sentence.While not necessary reading its like the last piece of chocolate cake:why not?
1,From an Englishman,"Unlike the other reviewers listed here I have the benefit and handicap of being an Englishman. I was greatly disappointed that one of Britains finest political interviewers whose pursuit of weasel worded politicians is remorseless, has produced such a lazy book. I had little recognition of the English portrayed, he has just peddled tired cliches that were not true even a decade ago. He only merits one star for pointing out the difference between English and British, something many English do not recognise. To all those who loved this book I would say that the English are for more complex and interesting than Paxman portrays us."
5,An Artist in the making,"My daughter has had a blast with this keyboard. Easy enough for the beginner to get started, enough features to keep them interested."
5,Better than I thought,"As always, Amazon shipped within days, and it came with the power supply. I bought this for my son for his birthday, and he hasn't stopped playing on it since. Now he will be taking lessons!"
1,Customer complaint,"The promised AC-Adapter was NOT included with the item and I requested that one be sent, but up to now, I have heard nothing from you, nor from the agency that sent the item to me. This is my first disappointing experience with Amazon.com. This is the type of experience that drives customers back to brick and mortar stores. Can you help me?"
3,"A pleasant , suspenseful surprise","I viewed this movie with some trepidation, given the title and the somewhat lurid box art. I've followed Henry Czerny's career with interest, and have found his career choices intriguing, so I thought, what the heck. In brief, I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of performances, production, and particularly the direction. In less talented hands, this could've been movie-of-the-week schlock, but here, it's quite effectively presented. Very little that could be called gratuitous...nicely atmospheric...something of a ""neighborhood noir."" Again: a pleasant surprise, and kudos to Czerny, an excellent supporting cast (who ARE those guys? ), and a director who bears watching."
2,From a clinical psychologist who coaches academics:,"In the final chapter of his book, Becker writes that ""(r)eading this book will not solve all your writing problems. It will hardly solve any of them."" I agree."
3,a quick yet comprehensive read,"I actually purchased the book for the person I share an office with. He is currently working on his dissertation and kind of at a stand still on page 5. After reading the book, within two weeks he was on page 50 and continues to progress ahead. He really liked the book and has recommended it to several other people. The book helped him focus less on making sure everything he was writing was perfect and more on trying to get a first draft done. While the book assisted him with this, it will probably not be helpful once the draft is done."
4,Value for Money,"Considering the price, this book offers a simple yet concise explanation on English usage. Recommended for non-native speakers."
1,Garbage product,"This cap is of the poorest quality, it is the size perhaps for a small childs head. I have no clue how this company could think an adult male could wear this in cold weather. So small does not fit on an average mans head, material so poor in quality not on par with any cold weather gear I have ever used. Company does not respond to emails. In short this was money completely wasted. If you do business with this company you know what to expect. Cheap sub standard product, company does not respond to complaints, they are obviously in business to make a quick buck ripping people off."
2,"Eh, not what I hoped for","The seller was great, showed up quickly, but as for glow, they don't hold a charge very long so by the time you've loaded them and started shooting, they aren't glowing anymore and hard to see in dark. Holds a charge for like 30 seconds tops."
1,Does not work on current Mac platforms,"When I tried to install it, I got the message that it was only usable on the obsolete Mac Classic platform. So I don't really have a good idea of how it works."
3,Pretty True to it's title,"This book was decent. It showed how makeup can camouflage problems. I do not, however, think I would recommend it."
4,Hockey Pads,It was pretty cool to see people with their very own ice rinks and Zamboni. It was also great to hear about the memorabilia that these guys have and to learn about what they love about hockey. I felt like I was watching mtv cribs but it was all hockey.
2,A little much,"I must give Alice Hoffman some credit for trying. Currently we are reading this song in my English class, and I noticed immediatley that this so-called lyrical prose is... too much. While other authors pull off the lyrical prose beautifully, Hoffman is just too much for me. Constant metaphors and repetition are very inaffective. It seems as if the author spent hours musing ways to put this story in a ""haunting"" way, rather than connect the reader with the characters' feelings. Her efforts fall flat. I am not finished with the book, and though I can not make any conclusions about the story, I must say what I feel about the language. Moderation would be nice. Hopefully the story gets better because right now I am quite bored with this book."
1,Big mistakes,"Excuse me but Sabre Dance is not by George Gerswin, Waltz from Maskarade is not by Chopin and Walz from Swan Lake is not by Bach. The first two are by Khachaturian and the last one is by Tchaikovsky. What a joke."
3,Just a Bit Dated,"It was actually out of date by 1982. It was essentially a critique of the Carter Era defense policy. Still worth a read for historical interest, and there were some basic principles of character that will never be outdated."
2,"House Sessions? I think NOT. But Tribal? Yes, Definitely","Although ""House"" is a overly used label to categorise many kinds of dance music it is certainly recognised now as a very specific genre with its own sub-genres such as tech-house or vocal-house etc. This 2 CD collection is certainly NOT house in that sense...these are CDs of mostly tribal music; fairly repetitive to boot. I would not necessarily purchase it unless you enjoy music that is nothing but pulsing drums with stabs of growling non melodic bass and a cheesy male ""deep club voice"" overdub on almost every song. The mix is done live which is good for DJ integrity but shows in mixing weakness. The songs go on for longer than you would anticipate (often 6 or 7 minutes) and are mixed tediously and inexpertly. No Global Underground mixing here."
2,"Wanted to like it, but...","While BSG was extremely dark, ultimately the stories, arcs and characters got one invested deeply in their resolution. Not so with Caprica. Just couldn't connect with anyone in the stories that week after week, just become more depressing and less appealing to watch. Never any redemption that lifted one's emotions. Only a constant path to see how far down in the dark depths they could reach. Great opportunity wasted."
1,ZZZZZZ,"Compleat snore fest. The Cylons all started from a bratty 14 year old girl who was programmed into a robot? Really? This is what you come up with? Is this BattleStar or ""A Small wonder""? The Wolfman Jack episodes of Galactica 1980 are better then this"
1,Half-Season - Really!,"I was almost suckered into buying this series, until I read a customer review that said it was only half a season.What is wrong with these a-hole studios!Why do they continue to discredit their reputations by lying to their would-be customers?Season 1.0 (no more versions)! What is next? Season 1**DISCLAIMER: Note that Season 1 means 1/2 season. This studio is blatantly deceiving you and takes no responsibilty for its actions.Oh, when you decide to conduct yourselves with truth, dignity and honesty in advertising, let me know. I may even purchase your series. Maybe?"
3,"7 episodes in, still watching, but just an ""OK"" BSG followup","I am a big BSG fan, so I was excited to hear a ""prequel"" of BSG was coming out. I definitely thought it would be interesting to see how the Cylons came into being. So we are 7 episodes in, watching weekly on SyFy channel, and I give it an ""OK,"" but reserve judgment to increase or decrease that rating later. To me, the characters or story lines aren't as compelling as in BSG. We do get to see Bill Adama as a young boy, and his father in his prime, but other than that, no other characters that will tie you back to BSG at this point.I'm definitely going to keep watching, because I am hoping it will improve, but it definitely didn't draw me in the way BSG did. I couldn't wait for the next episode of BSG to air. However, this one I TiVo and forget about. I don't even watch it live because I can wait to skip the commercials."
2,Big let down. . .,I really wanted to like this show . . . Watched every episode but it never really engrossed me like BSG. I thought the idea and the story was interesting but some key characters like Zoey and Adama were mis-cast. Eric Stoltz and Polly Walker were good but the other leads seemed dull. BSG had great stories and great acting from interesting characters. Caprica just didn't have the right stuff . . .I'm sad but not surprised that this show got cancelled.
5,Amazing. Really worth watching.,"I highly recommend the show for any BSG fans. I was really sad to see it go. I really think that watching the entire show, including the summary at the end of the series really adds to BSG. It's also a great show on its own."
4,Back to basics,"To me, this album epitomizes the work of the Indigo Girls. It's rare and bare boned, and not a lot of people appreciate acoustic music, which is why I enjoy this album all the more. It's wonderful to hear these women's soaring harmonies and vocals without having to swim through all the extra instruments. It seems with every new album, they added more and more, until their lyrics and voices were awash in the background noise (this is why I'm not a fan of their newest album). If you admire clarity, then this is the album for you."
4,Hip Hop fix,High energy at a good pace exercise routine. Each dance routine is segemented to learn easier which includes alternate step if you get lost. Good cardio workout that you can add in your own attitude.
3,Cool for a light workout. Not cool if you wanna learn to DANCE!,"If you *DO* wanna learn to dance, check outHow To Do The Robot - Breakdance Instructional DVDorTop 20 Breakdance Moves. These are GREAT videos. This one's ok if you want to do ""hip-hop"" aerobics though!"
2,2 Fast and Tough,"I am 37 and I haven't did aerobics for around 7 years at the gym. I wanted to get started again, because I loved aerobics and missed it. I put this DVD in and was amazed by her moves but I found her going fast and the moves hard to pick up. They were moves that I never did in aerobics class. I feel this is a very trendy aerobics class. The younger folks will love the dance like moves, but for me, I'll stick with Kathy Smith."
5,AMAZING and CHANGED MY LIFE,"I love this video. EVERYTHING about it is perfect. It almost seems as if some of the reviewers have never seen this dvd at all!The instructor is great, music decent, moves fun, works works works and you get 40 minutes!!!!! You can mix and match the ten minute segments or just choose one, etc. She explains everything and it moves at an excellent pace!I hope she makes more of these videos because the leader is wonderful."
3,"Fun, but took awhile to master...","This is a fun and effective cardio workout. However, the 10 minute segments are fast-paced and can be hard to follow at first. It took me three to four attempts before I had mastered the routines to the point where I felt like I was getting a good workout. An overall good edition to a home workout routine."
4,If you need to raise your heartrate and have fun ---- perfect,"Going to the gym 4+ times a week - dream on. I barely make it twice a week. This fits my needs really well - broken down into 10 minutes segments, if I can't do all four, or I do what I have time for, get my heart rate up and a light sweat.This really isn't a DVD for someone who sees themselves as going clubbing every weekend and looking for something to impress. It is for someone who is bored with the tedium of the CRUNCH line, and looking for something fun and quick. I didn't find the choreography particularly hard and ""cheesy"" seems to be an overused word on these reviews. If the moves aren't over dramatized, then it is hard for a viewer to see exactly what is being done so I figure cheesy is actually helpful to breaking down the moves.This is one of the few workouts which I actually felt cheerful instead of grim while doing it."
2,Not fun for me. Try Turbo Jam,I have about 30 workout dvd's. This is in my bottom 3. I did it all the way through twice and It wasn't fun or much of a workout. I didn't even break a sweat. I am in average shape. I bought it around the same time I purchased some Turbo Jam dvds so compared to them this one is not fun or challenging.
3,Difficult choreogoraphy but fun,"The three different dances that the instructors went through were fun, but the aerobic level is not high and the choreography is very difficult. Still, it was indeed fun and I wanted to go back and retry each segment, which means a longer workout! I've watched it more than once and will continue to use this DVD in my workout schedule when I don't need an intense workout."
4,preppy but fun,"I like this workout because it is fairly easy to follow and it gets your heart rate going. At first I thought it was kind of cheesy becase the dancers in the video are all white girls, however, the lead dancer is talented and a great teacher. I do think that the hip hop is definately of a more ""cacasian"" style but it is still a lot of fun and there are some challenging moves during the workouts. It is a great buy for the price."
1,Not for Beginners,I purchased the DVD hoping for a fun and easy way to excersice. I found the video hard to follow. And I quickly gave up !! It was a waste of my money.
5,Doesn't feel like a workout,"At first, the pure and innocent white girls doing hip hop (can't knock them too much, as I am one myself) seems quite cheesy. But after you get into the routine, you forget about all of that and start having fun trying to learn the routine. You get so into the routines that you don't even notice how hard you're breathing until you're done. Would definitely recommend."
3,It is ok,"I was expecting more from this work out after reading so many positive reviews, I bought the video and was dissapointed. I am passing it on to my little sister who is in her teens. The title is rather misleading, you can use this video for kicks if you don't feel like ""working out"" in the true sense of the word."
1,Basic concept missed,"The music and dance moves are fun BUT a basic concept in exercise was missed here. All of the shots are taken from the front. Unless your brain can rapidly learn and perform dance moves with the OPPOSITE side of the body that you are viewing, you will be awfully confused. It is much easier to learn body movements when viewing the instructor from BEHIND, so that your can copy the moves with the same side of the body.One of the few exercise videos that does this is the Firm's ""Boomers."" Too bad it's not available anymore."
1,Very disappointed.,"I purchased this video after reading many of the reviews and thought this would be a great alternative to traditional aerobics while learning some new dance moves to try when I go out dancing at the clubs.What a disappointment. The moves are poorly instructed, poorly cued, and generally difficult to follow. I realize that practice makes perfect, but the poor instruction and cueing leave me thinking I don't want to waste my time... I have other videos that will actually get me a good workout without feeling bewildered and confused."
2,This game is not worth the price,"I got this game and it only has two new teams and when you start the game all of your old levels you have beat are gone. You have to beat them all over again. But your scerinos are still there which is good. But they have many new upgrades but there all a waste of time. When you buy the original game you get 6 teams for 40 bucks and you get the new game for 30 bucks and there are only two teams. And there are teams they could make on this game that they didnt such as ewoks, jawas, and tuskin raiders. If I were you i would save my money and buy a better star wars game."
5,This Game is The Cats Pajama's,"Wow, I love this game, I have Bought similar games that give you access to Designing your own Scenarios, but this expansion pack Is my favorite to date.You have Access to Just about everything in the Starwars Universe! I grew up with Starwars And Being able to put these Characters in Endless Situations of your Likeing is Just incredible.Did you Know that you can Garrison your troops in Allied Buildings and Vehicles, or that typing simonsays or that's no moon unlocks secret characters, one of which is the Death Star, it eliminates an entire Section of the Visable Screen, no tree, rock or enemy left standing.If I am having a bad day, I wipe out a field of Angry charging Gungans with my superior Military.stress relief excelsior.If you like starcraft...you will be launched into hyperspace with Galactic Battlegrounds:Clone campaigns."
5,The Madden of hunting games!,"The graphics are amazing and blow away all other hunting games by far. This game has two player split-screen and real online play, not just stats. This is the only online Playstation 2 game on the market. Deer Hunter has always made the best hunting games out there and is truly the best hunting game on the Playstaion 2."
5,Excellent game,"I played this game at a friends house and I can say this game is absolutely excellent, it is better than the Cabela's hunting game, the gameplay absolutely just out ranks The cabela's hunting games which the Cabela's games SUCK. My friend asked me if I was going to get Deer Hunter for PS2. Let me borrow a catch fraze from Stone Cold Steve Austin......OH HELL YEAH...and anybody who says that Deer Hunter for PS2 sucks, YOU HAVE SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU, SEEK HELP"
1,Over-rated,"This game is highly over-rated - it has almost identical load times to the other hunting games out there but utterly terrible graphics. Why is every area dull and foggy? Why doesn't the sky change when it rains or the sun comes up? Why do the animals run around in circles? Why did my wife's character change into a man between games? Very disappointed over this one, ATARI you should be ashamed - NOT recommended."
3,This is going to be a nice game,"for those who like this class of game.This is the hunting game I have been waiting for.It will have 2 player split screen hunting.you can have hunting parties online and play with my buddies, or anyone else.Deer Hunter has always been the best series of hunting games."
5,Get on your knees and kiss the coffin,"I didn't find Nekromantix, they found me. Psychobilly infection filled my veins and i was hooked. The first psycho album i bought was Return of the Loving Dead, and this was the second.As far as live albums go, this is one of the best I've ever heard. The between-song banter is all in german or danish, can't really tell cause I speak neither, but if you can get over that, the rest of the record is english. This was recorded in copenhagen, denmark, hometown to the nekro's, and they play SO well live. This isn't one show, as near as i can tell, but it might be a few different shows put together. If you play bass or guitar and know all the nekromantix clasics by heart, then get ready to be shocked: this is different.My favorite track and favorite change was made to Howlin' at the Moon, which now has a saxophone. Amazing.The insert to the CD has some notes from Zorch of the Meteors.BUY THIS NOW!!!!!!!"
5,Feast Celebrations,"This book is a great help for planning meals that celebrate the bigger feast days in the Church Year. The ideas included help the preparer to add more meaning to the celebration with the food being used, as well as to educate those who partake!"
4,Waiting For A Long Time For DVDs,"This was one of my favorite shows, so of course it was going to get canceled just when I had become invested in it! I really hope this show appears on DVD soon -- since the great (and all too briefly aired) ""American Gothic"" and ""Freaks and Geeks"" are both on DVD, surely ""Relativity"" should have its own box set too. Still waiting ..."
4,Veloso,"A good selection of Veloso's more traditional bossa nova. A brilliant, sensitive composer & performer."
4,Does your mama know about them,"One of my favorite Motown albums of the 60's. Whether or not they are lesser known, Bobby Taylor and the Vancouvers was and still is one of my favorite Motown groups. Malinda was my favorite song and is still my favorite to this day. I was fortunate to have found this album. Thank you Amazon.com."
2,Only Very Light Work,"Fiskars , I'm sure is a good tool company. However these Loppers are fine for small trimming. The problem starts when the orange pieces holding the blades inside the handle break and come out. Then the blade parts won't stay in the handle and it becomes extremly irritating. Taping , bolting etc. does not help. Then your off looking for new loppers."
4,Rating of the Fiskar 9132.,The Fiskars 9132 Lopper was a very helpfull tool in the job of prunning our huge Mullberry tree. I took two days of cutting and trimming our 25 year old tree. I was very happy with it performance.
3,"Useful, thorough answers, lacks useful summaries","The answers to the first half of every chapter's exercieses in Volhardt and Schore's Organic Chemistry textbook are included within the textbook itself. However, answers to the second portion of the chapter's exercises can only be found in the Study Guide and Solutions Manual (this book), rendering the manual invaluable to organic chemistry students using the aforementioned textbook. While the manual is well-written, and most of the answers are clearly explained, it makes a poor study guide. The chapter summaries are no better, if not worse, than the summaries provided in the text. However, the inclusion of the answers to the exercises outweighs the insufficient ""Study Guide"" portion of the manual. The only reason to buy this book would be to accompany Volhardt and Schore's Organic Chemistry, Structure and Function, 3rd ed. I would not recommend it as a general organic chemistry study guide."
3,Will stick to the board game...,"Graphics are good and you save time from having to count the spaces to decide which direction you want to head. Unless you have a very large TV screen, found font size on questions very small (not related to age/degradation of eyesight). Questions seem more difficult than those from the board game. Found it annoying that the controller needs to be passed back and forth between players (perhaps having dual controls is a setting I haven't yet found?). Played only once since buying it a few months ago. Will probably go back to board game."
3,"If you're a lover of blues & gospel, you'll love it!",Darrell Mansfield is a great interpreter of blues tunes. He has a great heart for God & people that really comes through. If you've never heard Darrell before give this disc a shot! You won't be sorry!
2,You get what you pay for,"If you're looking for something fancy, keep looking. However, if cost is an issue and you don't need something formal, these will do. The paper isn't heavy and the print quality is low but it's the thought that counts."
2,HMMM,"Its a really nice ring, seems durable, ive had it for two hours and i put it on and the edges are so sharp, maybe my fingers are more webbed then normal but it hurts to much to wear :( so nice.. but oh well.. i recommend to any female interested.. it looks like a male ring... its dosent mean it is, but its as thick as a male ring and it has a more masculine look. also the edges hurt so when thinking about buying this, take into consideration its not ganna wear well on your fingers... other then that, i wish i could wear it."
4,A Great Introduction to Dylan's Latest Era,"This record probably deserves five stars, but like the average Dylan listener, I prefer the bitter harshness of Mr. Zimmerman's rambling blues of the 60's to this more relaxed sound. If anyone besides Bob had made this record, it would've been an easy five. Still, the production of this album is phenomenal (thanks Danny!) and the Dyl's phrasing is as perfect as ever. If you're hesitant to listen to Bob for his rough voice (I'm not), you may be pleasantly surprised. ""Most of the Time"" and ""Shooting Star"" are both featured in recent films (High Fidelity and Wonder Boys, respectfully), and are, along with ""Ring Them Bells,"" among the most moving songs I've ever heard. Bob retains his classic sound (check out the blues arrangement in ""Everything is Broken"") while also giving us a taste of what's to come."
4,Oh Mercy!,"After reviewing the negative article I wrote about ""Nashville Skyline,"" I realized I made a huge blunder by not including ""Oh Mercy"" as one of Dylan's few, later, greater, post-60s albums. Substitute the out-take ""Series of Dreams"" (Bootleg: Volume 3) for the lame ""Disease of Conceit,"" and you have something close to perfection. ****1/2"
4,"Haunting, mood evoking sound","Somehow I had always overlooked this cd until I read Dylan's Chronicles book. In it he describes the sessions in New Orleans that resulted in this recording and I was intrigued since I could tell that Dylan was clearly pleased with this work. Well, the cd does not disappoint. Dylan's songs are solid with a couple of real standouts including Man in the Long Black Coat , Most Of The Time and What Good Am I. The sound mix is really something with the really moody echo/phaser effect on the guitars and when Dylan blows his harmonica,though sparingly, it cuts like a knife. This may not be on the same plane as some of his masterpieces lyrically but man the sound just knocks me out."
4,"X-Men & Starfleet Officers, A great combonation","I really loved this book, and read it twice. I was confused a little bit the first time I read it, but realized that it was a sequel to a comic book. I thought that it was a good adventure all around, although Mike Friedman could have used other characters instead of members from Excalibur. I would have liked to have seen Gambit, Rogue, and Psylocke there instead. All in all, it was a good read. I hope that more Marvel Comics/Star Trek crossovers come out in novel form."
1,Don't even bother!,"I am not a TNG or X-Men fanatic, however, I do follow both and enjoy partaking in their respective adventures. I couldn't see how Friedman was going to take these two different universes and cross them over. I can say the result is disappointing.I won't go in the poor characterization of the X-Men nor will I discuss the horrible relationships that ensue between the Enterprise crew and the X-Men. I will suggest that you, the dear reader, avoid this book like the proverbial plaque."
4,An obscure gem of an independent movie,"I thought I'd write a little blurb about an independent movie I've seen that got little publicity, shown practically nowhere, and has been seen by practically no one. The script is great, though there is very little humor and filled with many awkward silences so it's a bit hard-hitting. But that's understandable knowing the situation the main character is in. The waitress who plays Vera is the same girl who played the ""band camp girl"" in American Pie movies. She's adorable here as Ricky's first love, and frankly, not quite as flat-chested as she was in those movies - she's grown up some. There isn't really a resolution to Ricky's return except that he faces his fears and goes on with his life. The rest is left up to the imagination. A provocative, well-executed movie worth seeing, a movie better than most major-studio pictures I've seen lately."
5,Great rock curriculum for second grade science,"I have used this for years to hunt for rocks all over the world without leaving my classroom. If we can't find the cd chosen missing rocks, we use what we have and other minerals to BAKE UP a new rock inside the bus oven. The kids just love this very serious tool."
5,If Only the Movie Was This Good,"Besides Star Trek: The Motion Picture, this is by far the best Star Trek score. The music evokes the mysteries of Space far better than the film and carries the movie, making it watchable, at least for me. In addition to the 2 main themes from the first film, Goldsmith comes up with wonderful new ones creating an epic-sounding score. However, this CD is brief and doesn't do the score full justice, leaving out a lot of music heard in the film. The album does contain the best cues except ""The Moon's a Window to Heaven"" track which took up space on the CD that could have been taken up by more of the superb score."
2,terrible quality,"Fans of this outstanding and underrated TV series will be quite disappointed in the quality, if this is the same product (only in a new box) that I purchased about 2 years ago. It's as though someone videotaped re-runs shown on the TVLand television channel, then somehow transfered them to DVD and figured out a way to sell it. Sometimes the idiot forgot to press pause on his VHS player when commercials came on, and many times it's as though the ""tracking"" control was in need of adjustment. Most of the discs won't even play, or they'll jam up in my DVD player. I was NOT happy when I began viewing my DVDs, so be very careful what you buy. Surely in this day and age, with enough interest from the public, the original copies could be PROFESSIONALLY transfered to DVD. I would be happy to pay for this series again if I could be guaranteed that the quality is as good as many other types of ""digitally remastered to DVD"" products available."
5,"coo-coo, sinks are my bag","do you know how long we've been waiting for this series to be put on DVD? every other bloody series from this era is on DVD, why did it take so long for this to come out? i watched this on hulu awhile back, thinking it wouldn't be as good as i remember, but it was! yes, it is a bit cheesy, but that's how things were. but i was kinda amazed at some of the acting in it after not having seen it for all those decades.oh, what a relief to know i'll finally have this great series to watch, with the handsome robert wagner, the great clothes and cars and jewelry, and that music!ABOUT TIME!!!!!!!!!"
5,NTSC DVD Format,I am anxious to purchase a copy of the new DVD set of It Takes a Thief. It was my favorite TV show. I noted that Entertainment One is releasing it. I also noted the format is DVD NTSC. Does anyone know if that will be a playback issue now that TVs are ATSC - or is that just a receiving issue?Thanks
3,Warner Bros. Handmade Collections,"A lot of the titles mentioned here are DVD-R releases under the Warner Brothers Handmade Collections. It Takes a Thief is on Antenna TV currently, Medical Center is not showing anywhere yet, The Girl from UNCLE is not currently showing but I think it is available from before. I bought two seasons of Falcon Crest, one was mass marketed and the other DVD-R. What I found was that the packaging was poor. It is a shame Shout Factory does not manufacture these titles. I bought all three seasons of The Patty Duke Show and they were well made. These shows deserve better. Also with new technologies developing all the time they will have to come out again."
5,Robert Wagner&It takes a thief,"It takes a thief was one the best tv shows to come along to tv and Robert Wagner who played the character Alexander Mundy played him well,it was first class tv show and should be released on dvd and if hollywood needs to take another tv show and turn it into a movie,it should be,it takes a thief."
2,Terrible Video Quality!!!,"(The date on this review should be 11/22 but because I placed an earlier review in October, it retains that date)What a huge dissapointment! I've been waiting for this show to come out on DVD for years. The video quality of these DVD's is shockingly bad. The first season is passable but the second season is faded and unclear and the third season looks like it was made from old second or third generation VHS copies taped off of TV 15 years ago. How they can charge $99 for this is perplexing. It's basically the equivalent of buying a bootleg set of DVD's. The paper sleeves that the DVD's come in are also a dissapointment due to the fact that the DVD's will get scratched more and more everytime you take them out or put them back in, plastic hubs would have been nice."
2,Nothing like missing pieces!,Would have been great except when we went to install it and pieces were missing! How fustrating. Both packages were missing the same piece.
3,Powerful Voice!,"I purchased this CD years ago in Germany and I like it very much. As known from the famous Prince Song ""Diamonds and Pearls"", Rosie Gaines possesses a very power-and soulful voice. Some of the Songs don't let her true voice shine, but most of the Songs are very good. The first Track reminds me of the music of Prince and it's an awesome Song. Unfortunately the Record Label doesn't released it as a commercial Single! Same with all the other Songs on this Album. I never heard one of the Songs on the Radio. That's really sad! She deserve to be a well known singer! Hope for the Future that we will hear a whole lot more from Rosie, because her voice is incredible!"
4,It's good.,"My bunny likes these pellets, I prefer to buy the oxbow timothy hay though because it has no alfalfa in it like this one"
4,Gorden Kent,This authors books are always good reads in my option. If you like Tom Clancy you will probably enjoy this. Good main and support characters put in military and law enforcement action scenarios with nice plot and suspense.A father and son coauthor in these. The sons name is Christian Cameron and he is an amazing historical fiction writer. In my option maybe the best right now.(Tyrant series and Killer of men are mind blowing books)
5,Art of the Carousel,Do such things as baby merry-go-round horses exist? There is a picture in this book that shows a foal and its mother. This makes an excellent companion book to A Pictorial History of the Carousel by Frederick Fried. Both books are illustrated lavishly.
3,Coming Home,"This film started out so well, I wonder how much better if might have been if you'd spent $100 instead of only $10. I liked the shot of the car coming home. The scene at the front door was well framed and set up great expectations. So, have a bake sale and embellish this short with the proceeds! Great acting!! Have fun."
4,"Short, funny, and straight to the point!","Ok, I can see some people saying ""too short"" or something silly like that--but this one was the length it needed to be, laugh out loud funny, and straight to the point. The other four films were exactly as long as the festival allowed them to be--and lost my interest after about 3 minutes each. This is the web, fer cryin' out loud! Who has a 7 minute attention span anymore? The film festival next year should set a limit of 4 minutes or less. Perhaps 3.Anyway, this film had high production values and was entertaining. I can't ask for more than that from an ultra-short film festival!"
1,"Pointless, unfunny",This is supposed to be a quick joke but it is not funny and it doesn't work. Pointless...
3,Is That All MY FRIEND?,"Nice try.....short, too short actually. I think the creator has fear of flying problems. Just didn't build me up long enough to create that laugh. Sort of a premature chuckle problem. I think they should try again."
3,Not That Funny,"It's a humourous idea, but I don't find it that funny. I didn't even crack a smile. I like to laugh too, but this just didn't do it for me."
3,Very Cute,"This made me laugh! I enjoy the little skit, but I wish I could see more about the main character's day. Very cute, though!"
2,Interesting at first...then caput!,It was interesting at first and the plot was getting thicker...suddenly... you know what is going to happen...almost from the begining...lacks originality...
1,Started off suspensful enough...,"The film maker cites Hitchcock as an influence. Yeah, we get that. I think the thing about Hitchcock that I liked so much is that he did not rely on ""Supernatural"" events such as unplugged computers powering up and connecting to the internet. I think that today's movie goer is a little too savvy for that. And that sort of thing moves this film from Suspense to Slasher flick. If you set out to make a Slasher flick, congrats! But don't be pretentious about it."
1,Sigh,Not a very great movie. I really don't buy the scenes where thehacker is manipulating the computers state.The only thing I enjoyed was the over the shoulder shot where we see her on the screen.The IM sounds were horrible and should really not be used that much. I almost had to turn off the movie because of this.Not much Hitchcock in this.Thumbs up for the theme though....
3,Suspenseful,"The film started out fine, and I especially liked the black and white lens. But the ending lacked because I didn't think the film was complete. It was sudden and obtuse. But still well made."
5,Wonderful music and wonderful recording,"I am a huge fan of the Klavier Wind Recording project and this is one of the best CDs yet released. There is a nice balance of works here that center around a common theme. From the bright sound of the Galbraith work to the dark and ponderous ""From a Dark Millenium"" by Joseph Schwantner, this CD has much to offer its listeners. I am always amazed at the fact that these are college level musicians and not professionals. Everything is technically precise and at the same time very musical and the recording is clear and very well balanced. This is can said for all of the recordings in the series as well. I wish Corporon and Klavier all the luck and hope they continue to deliver such high quality music."
1,"Shallow, no discussion of what each scientist accomlished","This book makes only brief, passing references about what each scientist accomplished. It instead is a collection personal opinions about the general merit of each scientist - sort of a printed gossip column."
2,Over 40 Minutes Cut & Sub Par Sound,This was released on Laser Disc with a run time of 91 minutes. Another example of putting out sub-standard content to make a buck. Welcome to the 21st Century! Of course if you don't have an LD Player your only & best bet. The other release of this material under the name of 'Classic Rock Legends' is even worse with no attemtpt to provide a clean video or sound track.
5,Makes you speak,Actually requires you to speak as opposed to memorize vocab. Great for practicing with a friend. A little less helpful on your own
2,Did I see this before?,Why do I feel like I've seen this one before. Perhaps from a film festivel from years ago. Everything looks dated - including the cars. Strange. hmmmmm....Now why do I feel like I'm being lied to.
2,hmm,"the camera work was pretty decent and the soundtrack worked well, but the movie just seemed pretty dumb to me."
2,ONE TIEM I GOT A PARKNG TIKET,ONE TIEM I GOT A PARKNG TIKET BUT I DIDNT RILLY WANT 2 SE A MOVEI ABOUT IT LOL NOT SURE WT W3RE THINKNG BUT MAYB TH3Y WANT 2 WIN 2 PAY TIKATS I GUAS WHO KNOWS LOL NOT MAH THANG MAN!!1111!!!11111!!11!
2,Sorry..,I am sorry to say I had to grit my teeth through this one! The concept was cute but it last way to long for what they were going for.
1,"1,579,234 Stupid indie shorts were made last year","Greater access to filmmaking tools does not equal an increase in quality. Poor editing. Weak idea. Lame execution. I've seen far better shorts shot on b+w reversal MOS. Go to school. This should have been 3 minutes max, if it should have existed at all"
2,"Great Idea, was let down","I have been hoping to see a film about meter maids evre sinced I lived in LA for five years. When I saw the title I was on the edge of my seat.There is so much material to write about. No one can stand meter maids and there are countless stories about each situation. I was extremely let down. If you are going to write about this topic there is only one way to do it. You need to concentrate on how hated meter maids are and that will be a comedy for the ages.It's not meant to be a love story. Meter Maid's should be an off the wall comedy. You started off on the right foot, but should of continued following the Meter Maid with the most citations."
4,"Mark, Liverpool","This collection presents Ms Fairchild during her 'Hey Day' with Billy Sherill at Columbia records. It includes the smash hit 'Teddy Bear song', along with other significant chart entries: 'Baby Doll', 'Kid's Stuff', 'Cheatin' is' and 'Mississippi,' which were significant Bill Board chart entries throughout the 1970's. Whereas this selection represents a cross section of some of her memorable recordings, it is difficult to excuse the omission of her superlative rendition of two of Tammy Wynette's most memorable standards: 'Too far gone' and 'Your good girls gonna go bad'. Also of note: there are no inclusions for entries of her last two album recordings for Columbia: 'Free and Easy' and 'This is me!'. All that having been said, this 14 track collection is a showcase of one of the most significant forces in pop-Country that emerged during the 1970's."
5,They might have been something special...,"...if they hadn't had to share the same record label (at roughly the same time) with Boyz II Men. A smooth, harmonious, and aptly-named vocal quartet, they never really got off the ground despite some songwriting credits by Keri Lewis of Mint Condition. Though there are a couple of uninspiring hip-hop tracks, the majority of the album consists of beautiful and sexy ballads that fans of Boyz II Men or Mint Condition should definitely enjoy. Standouts include ""Where Do Broken Hearts Belong,"" ""I Knew All Along,"" and ""Sex In The Rain."""
4,Fascinating playing; poor transfers,"Piano lovers have grown to treasure Hofmann, Rachmaninoff, Lhevinne, etc. -- Pachmann joins them as a striking personality with beautiful, pearlescent tone. This CD, if studied, will disperse the view that he was merely an eccentric who could not play cleanly. Beautiful and highly individual. However, be warned: Those used to current restoration techniques are in for a shock. The roar of hiss is like I've never heard -- like a jet plane taking off -- and I own and play 78's routinely. Someone needs to advise these people on the rudiments of needle selection and nominal frequency range of acoustic technology."
5,Adults Will Love This Series !!!,"This series tackles intense material. Love(Aang and Katara), Death(Uncle Iroes' son), Genocide(The death of the Airbenders),Domestic Violence(Zukos face burned by his father), Drugs(Sakka high on cactus juice), Corruption in Government, Brainwashing, Animal cruelty(Appa's lost days).It deals with these subjects gently enough for older children tounderstand that choices have to be made, lived with, and that its not easy sometimes. But like the opening credits say,""I belive Aang can savethe world."" Have a nice Avatar Day."
4,"Clever title, interesting cover, lineup change, it still works","It has been a while since I listened to REO, one of my favorite bands of my younger years. I too had lost interest with this line-up change. I recently renewed my interest after seeing REO Speedwagon on TV, performing live music for an ice skating show, and hearing about their Christmas album, which is BTW pretty good. So you might say this revisited listen was a bit less bias. This time around I would say the Chicken is every bit as good as any release from thier prior popular period. Nine Lives and Tuna Fish are still tops for me, but this made the revisit so much more interesting. It was certainly worth the download. Dave and Bryan are quality musicians and bring their own little nuances to the sound, as did Gary and Alan. Hey, change is not always a bad thing."
4,Really fun!,"My 4 year old can't get enough of this game. He's been able to figure it out without much assistance and has really been enjoying it. However, the sound goes out occasionally and requires a reboot. Still, it's a great game!"
4,"Entertaining, Yet Fairly Easy {4 Stars}","There isn't a whole lot I can add to the other reviews, but I disagree when some say that this game is challenging. I bought this game about a week ago and I've already beaten it. No guide, no internet walkthroughs, no cheats. Honestly, that's never been the case for me with ANY GTA game that I've played. Heck, I'm still trying to beat San Andreas (I play straight up with no cheats or guides/helpers) and I've had that game for over a year now. The ending is kind of cheesy too, but it's still a good game and makes for a great pacifier until the next GTA comes out. And at $20, you can't really go wrong anyway."
3,GTA is O.K.,"The game is all right, but it seems like the game was put together rapidly and with not much creativity or thought into the story line. Basic controls and basic missions."
3,disapointed,"I was disapointed when i listend to POO for theses reasons. 1. The vocal. A high pitched ""geignar,nasal"" singner within a wide vocal range. 2. Yes technical drumming, but he seems to always soloing. I'd like more beat here. Looking at the entire album he seems to play the same thing, same way. 3. No good compositions and production. I'm a fan of techmetal from Death to Symphony-X,by Spiral Architect to Cynic. But, i could not see why people are so interested to it. I'll try to give it more and more listen, if one day i change my idea about it, i'll make you know."
5,Why I am a member of the church of Christ,The questions I had about the churches are answered from the Bible. The answers are from the scriptures themselves. This book relies on the orginial languages for answers.
2,A way to cure insomnia,"I found some of the facts mentioned in the book interesting. Those that had nothing to do with sweeney todd but, the history of London. It was a very slow and painful read. I wish there was a way to return all the wasted time i spent trying to get through this book."
1,Broke,this mask broke the first time i used it and it was horrible the elastic broke and the rubber bracket for the elastic broke to which made the mask useless because it wouldnt stay on my head
5,General Idea,"Its like a pocket sized book. It contains monologues from various plays, categorized according to circumstance. Its a great book, I highly recommend it for auditioning with monologues."
3,deep in vogue,"i think that he was ahead of his time with this cd!!! If you rent""Paris is Burning"" you will know that malcolm mclaren invented all the vogue craze with this song!!! He should be collaberating with madonna and her crew today with all his thoughts and direction!! love it!!!!!!!!!!!JR"
5,Our Saturday Morning favourite!,"This album is a choice pick for my wife and I to start the weekend. It is a wonderful blend of old and new, strung together with bouncing melodies that just put you in the right frame of mind for fun. It is a refreshingly different album that most people will find something in it to their liking. Wake up the neighbours by singing this album, full noise on the stereo, in the shower! Enjoy!"
5,Outstanding,"The Night Land is Hodgson's most complex work and not to everyone's taste. It is though an important foundation of fantasy literature much as Dunsany's King of Elfland's daughter is. The tragedy of Hodgson is that he died at tender age in the trenches of the first world war and his gift of writing was taken from us.These books are my favourite not only for their content but the way in which the publishers have presented them. The Amazon picture does not give full justice to them - they are full size harcovers with blue faux? leather boards, no dustjacket, each book has a wonderful silver gilt lithograph? imprinted into the covers, illustrated within by Jason Van Hollander. Flat spine with silver compass floret and vol no , title , author , publisher. Back cover has silver guilt Hodgson portrait and occult border. Section sewn pages add to durability and I would imagine acid free paper."
3,Too small,"We'd broken or chipped just about every mug we had, and it was time to get a replacement set. We like mugs that don't have a thick edge (the sort that make it too easy to spill tea/coffee down your chin). The product description didn't include the mug capacity, but I liked the look of the mugs and bought them anyway. These only hold about 8oz, so I am now looking for another set! That's why I have only given 3 stars - I feel as though I wasted my time. The mugs themselves are attractive: if only they were larger, they'd be perfect for our everyday needs. As it is, they'll probably sit at the back of the cupboard as spares - which wasn't what I had in mind at all."
5,Very Helpful,"Exercises are often best taught by demonstration. Even though I had read three books on these exercises and taken one class, I picked up some very helpful pointers from this video that made it worth the investment."
4,Extremely Annoying Clicking Sounds Throughout,"Now that everything's been said in praise of this Living Room Tour double CD, isn't it about time at least one person mentions the extremely annoying clicking sounds at the end of several tracks which indicate the song's been cut short for the next one? Listen to the end of You Make Me Feel Like a Natural Woman: Even before Carole's voice is finished, there's a clicking sound and we're onto the next track. Do we blame Rudy Guess for this (Mixed by him) or Engineer Brandon Miller? More sensitivity, please guys!"
5,Musical magic by a true legend,"I saw Carole King on the Living Room Tour, and I am so glad I did. It was just her, the piano, her longtime guitarist Rudy Guess, and Gary Burr, a very talented guitarist, singer and songwriter in his own right - in a ""living room"" kind of setting. That's it - just the three of them. This CD brings it all back - ""Where You Lead,"" with Carole's daughter Louise Goffin, the rocking acoustic ""Jazzman,"" the ""Gerry Goffin/Carole King Medley"" (LOTS of wonderful songs included - some I didn't know they had co-written), a great acoustic version of ""Smackwater Jack,"" and a haunting ""Now and Forever,"" which makes me cry every time I hear it. The only one missing here is ""Been to Canaan,"" which she played the night I saw her, but otherwise, it's wonderful. No matter what some of the other reviewers here say, this is a great way to hear and see any musician - without the full band, in their living room, where it all begins. Thanks, Carole, for sharing this."
4,Amazing,"After reading Rolando's review above, it is apparent that he is a fan of slickly produced ""ear candy"" as opposed to raw emotion.I find the raspiness in Carole's voice to be quite rootsy and appealing.I would be curious to know the reviewer's evaluation of other singer/songwriters. It may be true that Tom Waits, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Greg Brown, etc. will never be compared to Pavarotti.That being said, those guys don't have to worry about the admiration and respect of their fans, and peers.If Rolando wants soulless sterility maybe he should dust off his old Journey L.P.'s."
1,"I love her, but . . .","I could not get by the poor vocals. I know she is 62 and it is about the music, but it was too much for me. Her voice is scratchy through most of the discs with struggling to hit some notes."
4,Great Cardio Workout,"Like the other Quick Fix workouts, I love this DVD. It combines cardio with toning so if you are able to do all 4 segments, you get a great total body workout including the cardio. The moves are not difficult which lends to a better cardio effect. I like to do 2 or 3 segments and combine it with the Arm and Leg workout plus one of the Ab segments from the Quick Fix Total Mix DVD for an excellent total body workout."
4,A favorite,"I bought this DVD years ago & it is still one of my favorite workout DVDs (and I have a big collection). Easy to follow, but still a good sweat. A good mix of kicks, punches, and combo routines. Nothing crazy like you find in many boot camp DVDs where they seem to throw in every type of exercise known to man. This is a simple, quick workout when you need a fast calorie burn."
1,do not buy,"I bought this with a rock polisher, but had horrible results for the price I spent. Not sure if it is due to the mix or the polisher itself, but the results were not what I expected."
5,perfect 10,I love this album it's a one of a kind sound of jazz and hip- hop combined and the sound of his horn playing makes the album more unique. When I fist heard it I fell in love with the rythmatic melodies.
3,Good throwback,Good throwback album. I only give it 3 stars 'cause it was essentially a Boyz II Men remixes album. All that talent on the Biv 10 label and most acts only got to play a part in one posse cut. A true waste. But definitely worth having in your old school collection.
5,EMERGENCY CRANK RADIO,"Everyone should own an Eton emergency crank radio. It will run off an adapter, off batteries or by hand crank. Whether you live on the East coast (hurricanes), in the Midwest (thunderstorms & tornadoes), or on the West coast (earthquakes), you can never tell when an emergency will require the use of a radio. Even if you only have to use it once, it will more than pay for itself. It is also great out on a boat. I have used it a few times just to experiment with it's capabilities, and am very pleased."
2,"Okay, but lightweight plastic and doesn't recharge all cellphones.","Product is a good emergency ideal that includes a cellphone rechargers. HOWEVER, it does NOT recharge many cellphones! Their tech support group (1-800-872-2228) confirms this. I reported that it won't recharge the Nokia 3595 (for example), and would they publish a list of non-compatible cellphones on their website. They said no, that they just wanted to sell as many products as possible and if the units didn't work, then consumers can return the units. This is a stupid and greedy product strategy. There's no reason that the company couldn't put a list on their website to confirm or advise to buyers if there are known incompatabilities."
1,Beware Buyers,"This product came very fast which I was happy about, BUT it was not the color I wanted it to be. I contacted the seller and they said I quote;""Sorry to hear of your disappointment. We do NOT have any RED color radios.The Amazon ad showed 3 different color options but as a Marketplace Sellerwe are not allowed to make any changes to the titles.But this is the reason we tried to make it clear in our COMMENTS section"".Usually, I read the reviews and the seller feedback, however I think that if I was able to actually choose red for the color it is a bit misleading. Also, the comment section is not very clear and I have yet to find it as well. I highly recommend purchasing a product from a seller who gives you EXACTLY what you want and makes it CLEAR as to EXACTLY WHAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE. As a long time Amazon shopper, I am very disappointed in cusomer service and I plan not to purchase from this seller again."
3,Eton Crank Radio,"It does what it says it does, ie. you can run it by winding it up. What it doesn't seem to have is much of a front-end (tuning capacity). Local NPR station here which I can receive on every other radio in the house is a sometime thing on this machine. I also have great difficulty receiving the National Weather Channels."
3,THE PRICE IS JUST RIGHT NOW!,"WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD PAY SEVENTY DOLLARS FOR THIS TOY SET? I MEAN COME ON!!!! ALL IT IS IS ONE DOLL AND ONE VEHICLE. IT IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING WORTH 70 DOLLARS. MAYBE 25 OR 30 DOLLARS BECAUSE YEAH LINDSAY LOHAN IS A *STAR* AND ALL, BUT COME ON!!!!!!....SEVENTY FREAKING DOLLARS?????? YOU WOULD BE NUTS TO BUY THIS SET. AND THAT'S MY 2 CENTS WORTH! JUNE 14TH 2006: HEY!!!!! THEY LOWERED THE PRICE! BY A LOT!!!!!! NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO BUY THIS SET! BEFORE THEY ALL SELL OUT!!!!!!"
1,AWFULLL!!!!!!!,"WORST COMAany ever!!! send me broken items and taking me on a wild ride of he said she said. wont send me a return label and really rude. DOn't buy from them. I don't write many review so it was really not good! Plus the chair seats were falling off, the table stained, on top of being broken. I am still waiting for a refund and return label. stay away!!!"
1,Fallen Standards,"One more pretentious exercise in pointlessness. Don't bother, unless your cinematic sensibilities never exceeded the nihilism of an adolescent."
5,"Enchanting, Exhiliirating and Inspiring","This movie is absorbing and enchanting without a minuet of boredom which in itself is quite a feat. A follow up to the superb ""Chungking Express"" this is like it's darker counterpart. The scene when Leon Lai walks Karen Mok home in the rain breaks my heart everytime...and the scenes with Takeshi Kaneshiro and the ice cream guy has me laughing out loud every time. This movie and it's predecessor are must see movies. These are the types of movies that turn you on to these types of movies. Wong Kar Wai has a rare talent for capturing moments. Perfect music selection especially ""Karmacoma"" and the Cantonese song that Michelle Reis plays on the jukebox called ""Forget him"" by Teresa Tang.This and ""Chungking Express"" are two of the only movies that I rewatch because I fall in love with them all over again each time. The director honestly shows the raw emotions in a way that you can't help but feel them too. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."
3,Jack and Jill video,This video is alright. Don't particularly care for the fact that it's in segments. My 2 yr old daughter enjoys watching it.
3,I agree but it has some good qualities,"I bought this Cd many years ago when I saw the video for So High. I also enjoy Tic Away, Joy and Changes. Yes, the rest is pretty vulgar, too bad because with the right songs and production they could have done better."
4,Just returned from Italy,"These CDs were an excellent preparation for both my husband and me during last month's trip to Italy. The ""asking for directions"" lesson was especially helpful as we rented a car and had to find our way along many rural roads in Southern Italy. The bonus audiobook, ""Secrets of Learning a Foreign Language,"" was surprisingly helpful. It offered many tips that I had never heard before, even during college Spanish courses.We never got bored because the variety of lessons on the nine Italian CDs took several months to master. This was the third set of language CDs we ordered and by far the best. The only negative we found was that the CDs refered to lire, and not Euros. However, the questions about exchange rates were basically the same."
2,Sport Luxury Sleek Universal Bucket Seat Cover-Black,Good looking product but very weak.I had one of the same one before that I bought from an autozone and it last fair enough. Then went to look for the same one in amazon and as soon I sat 4 times it broke where the little screen is.
5,Great quality and fit,"Got these from Amazon as the price was amazing and because of the quality(less expensive than cheap Chinese made ones form Auto Zone, Napa, Oreilly's). MOOG is known for being great quality and these were no exception. Included ALL parts from the grease zerks to the seals (which you cannot buy on their own anywhere)and Made in the USA.Grease zerks threaded in perfectly the first time (unlike many other non MOOG suspension parts that I have purchased through the years). Fit my 1972 Chevy C10 2 wheel drive perfectly. They were so finely machined that I actually had to scuff them up a little to paint so that the paint would stick well."
4,good product,I have used these before and they work as good as any blades I have triedno complaints with this purchase
5,Brilliant.,"This book is flat-out excellent. The writing is beautiful without overwhelming the strange, strange story; the ""historical"" aspect is handled deftly, without the trappings of 90s politics--the reader is never led, and this one certainly didn't have to be. This is literature. People should be carrying Josh Russell around on their shoulders. It's twisted and true, it's hot and bothered. Read it."
1,Find something else to spend your money on.,"I got my keychain as a gift from my brother. It was new still in the box. He had not taken it out and played with it like some of the people that have writen reviews. I followed the instructions exactly. I did not have any problems using the software, other than it looks like it was writen by a five year old. The problem I have is that my keychain came with a bad battery. The only way to view the pictures is to plug it into a wall outlet. There is no way to replace the battery when it goes bad. I went to TAO's website and this looks like a common problem. Do they not test their products before shipping them? Who makes a digital product that runs on batteries, but makes it so that the batteries can not be replaced?"
5,Excellent product,"I found an 8 count box of this product at that famous retailer the wall of marts, if you get my meaning. It was less than a dollar, so I gave them a try. And I have to say, I had much better luck with these than the name brands. Not to get too graphic, but they actually stayed in and were more absorbent than the expensive brands. I am a fan. Been looking around for bigger boxes, so far this is the only place I have found them."
5,Funny and original!!,"Kathleen Madigan is truly an underappreciated, refreshingly talented artist. The routine on this CD is hilarious (although the OJ and Kurt Cobain references are kind of dated now). I laughed so hard I cried during the tornadoes and flying bathtubs part and then the ""Who Farted?"" hat guy! She makes fun blackjack dealers on riverboat casinos, gangs and 'professional' bowlers - no one is safe! Buy this CD, it will make your commute a lot more fun (even if the people next to you think you're losing it!)"
3,Could have cleaned up the sound,The songs are great but as for the sound? You would think with today's technology there would be less airy/scratchy background noise. I kind of expected better audio quality than what I got. If you are looking for that old timey feel to the music. This version delivers.
1,"good product, poor longevity",bought 3 for the house in 6/07. two of the units failed within one month of each other (2/10 and 3/10). one out of three would be chance. two out of three not so.
2,Doesn't last,Stopped working after a year. New batteries just made the alarm go off. Had to get a new unit.
1,Didn't Stand the Test of Time,"I bought one of these for my small condo. When it first arrived, it worked as intended. After about 1.5 years, the display stopped working correctly and had missing segments on the LCD. Pressing the Test button produced no test alert. Replacing the batteries had no effect. What bothers me is that there was no ""warning"" that the device was failing. I never once heard the slightest chirp from it. What good is a 5 year warranty if there's a good chance you won't even notice the device has failed until it fails to save your life. And you die. Does that seem melodramatic? Maybe. But when discussing a device designed to save lives, I think it's a realistic assessment of the situation."
4,This is good stuff!!!!,"This is a great cd full of songs to lift the spirit and calm the troubled soul. Ten different choirs, eleven songs and many featured guest artists. This disc contains many styles of choir music, a little something for everyone, but all are delivered givng glory to God. Young and old alike should appreciate this projects efforts."
3,Get the All Hallows EP instead,"Although this EP does include a cover of the great Cure song ""The Hanging Garden"" and an excellent cover of the Misfits' ""Demonomania"" the two AFI songs on here don't hold up very well. Unless you're the kind of person that likes spending their cash-money on four mediocre songs, you'll probably be disappointed by this. I can see why some people like this and some people don't, so I guess you'll either love it, or feel ripped off after buying it. In any event, I still say bypass this one and get the All Hallow's EP."
1,"Powerful gadget, poorly implemented. I returned it.","This phone is very powerful and is clearly capable of great things, but the implementation is horrible. The buttons don't feel right and are easily pressed by accident, the hinge feels weak and breakable, and the software is a huge mess. Even after adding memory and turning off the auto-data feature, battery life was still disappointing and the phone often felt sluggish. Tack on a nasty echo on every third or fourth call, and that was more than enough to return it. I wouldn't order it again.Make sure to call AT&T; if you return a phone at amazon within 30 days. You should qualify for the 30 day satisfaction guarantee, and they should be able to offer you a new free phone with the same number."
4,Component cable for projector,"Component DB15 to 3 RCA was a real problem to find out.Online you can easily buy something around $200-400 but itwould be a waste of money. I found out only two options at the moment - buy a budget Steren 253-525IV cable ( 25' long) - price varies from $20 to $60 online , thus spend some time to shop around ,second option was to build a custom made cable out of shielded Cat5e cable. Do not know which one would be a better onefor 25' run. Some people might try to use 3xRG6 cables - anda short breakout DB15to3RCA/BNC cable"
3,The book had no typical plot,"It had a good point , but it took things too slow.It couklve had another thing happening.Other then that i really love this series"
2,The cats love it but it broke very easily and is unstable,"I purchased this about a month ago at Target. Although it appeared somewhat flimsy as I put it together, I was so thrilled with it at first. The price was very reasonable, it was very easy to put together, and most important of all, my cats (especially my 8-mo old kitten) just love it. My kitten is on it every day sometimes for hours at a time.I've been a bit concerned that it has toppled over a few times since we got it but I was even more dismayed to discover yesterday that the top of the tunnel has ripped. The tunnel is made out of very thin material like that of a windbreaker or duffel bag. Today I discovered that one of the angled arms has also broken. I realize that the price was reasonable but it becomes very expensive when it breaks in about a month.I'm so disappointed because the cats really love this and now I have to return it and find something else for them. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because the cats love it so much."
1,DONT BUY IT!,"My cat hates it,,i think he is scare of it,,the first time he saw it he was curious like any cat would be but once it was built all he did was go in ,smelled it and left .HE NEVER PLAYED IN IT AT ALL, i hated all those people that said to me that thing was fun for all cats.Its a lie,,that thing was out in the middle of the room for weeks and he never showed interest in it.He likes other toys like feather teasers and chew on toys,maybe thats why.The thing is so light that when i tried putting him on top of it ,it seemed that thing was going to break,,it was sinking in because of the weight of my cat.My cat got scared probably thinking it wasn't going to hold him and the minute i let go of him he took off running to hide.HORRIBLE.WASTE OF MONEY."
2,Flawed,"My two cats enjoy the gym somewhat. One particularly enjoys playing with the dangling mice, and the other will rest at times on one of the three levels. On that basis, I would rate it as a three star for the price.I do rate it a star lower for a couple of reasons.1) The picture does not emulate the actuality of the model. The picture is multi-colored and bright. The actual gym is a dark, drab blue-green and the mice are grey. A bit of false advertisement should never be rewarded.2) One part inaccurately packed and shipped. There are 4 ""legs"" that form the sides of the rounded portion of the gym. Two female parts and two male parts that link together are essential. Mine shipped with 3 male parts and only 1 female, causing me to be unable to construct the rounded portion of the gym."
2,Almost unlistenable,"I bought the album based on the reviews and was very disappointed. I didn't find it to be witty, danceable, or charming. Musically, all the songs sound the same and the vocals are just unpleasantly shrill.It's probably better suited for people who prefer energy above ingenuity."
5,A terrific film ...,"This is one of Meryl Streep's early films and it is a masterpiece. It's the story of a married Senator who has an affair with a woman on the fringes of politics, while his wife, a therapist, slowly realizes what is going on and with whom.It's as if the Senator thought no one would ever find out. Lots of angst at the end, and well played by all the actors."
3,A gift,"I got these for my nephews birthday I was dissapointed in the quality there are lots of little painting errors/paint smears some of the other toobs seem a lot nicer (I have bought 5 toobs) I am sure my nephew will still love them but I was dissapointed, especially since it is meant as a gift (I got him 2 other toobs as well the desert and rainforest animals, which I like better)"
4,I'm Loving It!,"Money well-spent.Pros:Amazing eye candy! Adds a whole new level of realism. Looks great in GR:AW, but looks simply amazing in GR:AW 2! I have yet to try it in other games, but I am sure it will work well in those as well.Cons:Price.Not many games support the Ageia PPU.Uses PCI, wait until the PCI-e PhysX card comes out.'Some' of the added affects such as in GR:AW look a little cheesy, but that is not the fault of the card.Causes a somewhat lower frame rate, but not alot in my experience.Don't let the cons deter you, they are only minor complaints!Would I buy it again? Definately, although I would wait for the PCI-e version."
3,Nvidia create a new graphics card contain physx card,"As we know that Physx card is not support all games but only a few games. However, Nvidia now is taking physx card for its a new graphics card like GTX 280 ( to defeat ATI) so, many games in future will support Physx card and I think that ASUS and BFG will stop making this Physx card.I will give it 3 stars and maybe in future these stars will grow to become 5 stars by Nvidia.Note: a new drive for this card in Nvidia website."
2,not one of the golden oldies,It was obvious from the start that this movie was filmed in southern California. Black and white does not serve this moviewell either.
5,"This is a traveler's video, not a tourist's","I was amazed when I came across the Lonely Planet video series. The typical travel video shows tourists attractions and pretty scenery, perfect for grandma.I have traveled to 24 countries and far prefer finding my way around, hosteling, and mixxing with the locals. If you are like me, you'll really like or love every LP video. If you have a sense of adventure and a sense of humor, you'll enjoy Ian Wright as a guide. I found this video to be a descent sampling of the countries and their people.If you haven't traveled or need a guide and an air conditioned tour bus, this series may not be for you. If you are a traveler or would like to be one, get the LP video and or book before you go."
3,"The Iceland/Greenland video was OK, but lacks a lot","Fortunately, I only borrowed this video from the library. I was psersonally a bit disappointed with the video as well. There were a couple good parts, but most of the parts, the video seemed like it was focusing on the traveller and his comic-acts, other than what Iceland & Greenland is really about. They did not show enough of Iceland, which is surprising because Iceland has a lot to see, especially the nature of volcanoes and rugged landscapes. I personally think that they should have put a bit more time into filming more tourist attractions & the wonders of nature of both Iceland and Greenland, other than focusing on the traveller himself. Overall, it was OK, but I wouldn't BUY it."
1,Very poorly written...,"As one who believes that we are free from the Law and tithing, I purchased this book with great expectations of finding more information to add to my studies.This book has to be the worst book I have ever purchased. The author seemed to have something to say but it was buried in a sea of disjointed grammatical syntax, poor punctuation and poorly annotated text.Normally, being a writer myself, I can make my way through the most tenuous writing. But no amount of experience can decipher the words of one who does not write grammatically correct sentences and uses punctuation in such a way so as to cloud the true meaning of what he wrote.The sad truth is that this man has something to say but apparently lacks the necessary writing skills to successfully get his points across to the reader. Don't waste your time and money on this tome as you will not be able to understand it.Yes, it's that bad!"
4,Snowballs,This is a really nice book for children. The pictures are beautiful. Great to use with art activities or winter theme.
5,Snowballs book,"This book arrived quickly and was in great condition,just as it was stated in the description. It was a gift and was greatly appreciated by the recipient ."
2,A Curiosity,"New Skete's reformed services are occasionally interesting from an historical viewpoint. Nevertheless, they should be seen for what they are: an aping of the Latin liturgical self-destruction of the last 30 years. The language in their translations is also unbearably pedestrian."
