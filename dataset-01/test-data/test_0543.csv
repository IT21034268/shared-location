1,A Waste of Perfectly Good CD's (on the distributers part)...,"sorry apparently this has to have a rating of one in order to count/ show up, although it doesnt even deserve a -1 or less star...What was this person thinking when she singingin this ""tribute"" to Shakira? I have been a Shakira fan for over 7 years, and thI'm sorry to say, there are no words to describe this CD... thats HOW BAD IT IS! But you know, it's odd how theres no name as to who is singing the songs...Honestly, I didn't buy this cd I thought I'd hear some samples first, and OMG if you like, admire and LOVE Shakira, dont ""burn"" your ears with this.... whatever they want to call it."
5,Ever want to attend a Tom Peters Seminar?,"Ever want to attend a Tom Peters Seminar? I read this when the uber-guru was at his most popular, and for a variety of reasons, it wasn't feasible. This book marks a divergence from his position as a leading edge advisor to senior management, to an over-the-bleeding-edge exhorting firebrand to middle management. This is meant in the best of senses. It pushes towards getting close to his customers (old news by now) but in a practical, ""Set up X meetings with weird customer..."" sense.Years later I heard Mr. Peters speak in person, and my takeaway was the book does indeed capture his energy, as much as it's possible. It's no substitute for the real thing, but it's an admirabe replacement if that isn't possible."
4,more energy efficient buildings,"Gosh, there's a clever acronym offered by the book - BEQUEST = Building, Environmental QUality Evaluation for SusTainability. It is explained as offering a reworking of urban areas. So that a distinctive urban culture might emerge, in a spatially compact form. Accompanied by heavy use of energy efficient public transport. Explained in this way, it is certainly desirable in many European cities. Or American ones, for that matter.Building design is meant to enable most of these properties. So that a building would take full advantage of natural daylighting and ventilation, and have super-insulation. Reducing the overall energy needs of its occupants. Plus, simply making taller buildings helps increase the compactness of the overall city, and the efficiency of roads and public transport."
2,Poor Video quality,"I've never been let down by reviews on Amazon...Until now. Based upon great reviews, I ordered this unit in a heartbeat. Came in ontime and hooked up easily. Switching between IBM T42 Thinkpad and Compaq PC with a Viewsonic 21"" LCD Monitor.The switch worked as promised but the video quality was less than spectacluar. Graphics showed up fine, but text quality was very fuzzy. Considering I use my computers to do modeling in Excel, Access, AutoCAD, and Arena, the ease of use and not having to switch beteen these PCs on Remote Desktop Connection does not outweigh the headache I got in the short amount of time using the KVM."
4,Good switch,"I am pretty happy with this purchase. The only problem was that it not work with my laptop dock. When the laptop is off the dock it works fine. So I give it a four star. I communicated with the vendor regarding this issue and the person working with me told me that it is difficult for ConnectPro to accommodate docking stations ""because of the fact that most companies will use proprietary connections"". I think that is understandable. The device is quality built."
2,"Too many ""Word Puzzles""","I was expecting a book of puzzles that were more mathematically based. When I think of word puzzles, I think of a mathematical problem in which the question uses words.Here is an example of a puzzle in this book: ""Corresponding to each word or phrase given below is another word, similar in meaning, which is also the name of an animal. EXAMPLE: lifting device ANSWER: crane""To me, this is more like a crossword puzzle book, you just don't have to fit your answers into a crossword puzzle template.If you like this type of puzzle, then there are a lot of word ""teasers"" in here for you. If you are looking for a brain teaser book to challenge the mathematical side of your brain, there are probably better books out there."
2,Simply ridiculous...,"Extremely, extremely (can't emphasize enough) simple. DVD (video) quality is bad. The commentator is annoying. Only a handful of unrelated poses. Not in a ""program"" format. A waste of money."
1,USB design,"The USB specification can be downloaded from USB ORG web page free. This book contains a part of the spec. If you want to start design USB hardware and software then I would suggest ""USB Design by Example"" written by John Hyde. ""USB Design by Example"" is an excellent book."
2,USB spec revisited. BORING!,"This book was not very good. In fact, it was almost as boring as reading the spec itself. Sure it does have alot of information but it is presented in a factual and abstract way. It does not help clarify the spec any. It is just like a synopsis. It is better than reading the spec but still, not quite the book you want to get if you want to actually design something."
3,Useable,"If you cannot obtain a copy of the 1.0 USB Specification then this book is a good substitute. It pretty much includes the spec, paraphrased, with relevant discussions."
4,Complete and critical; extremely useful for anyone,"The authors have opinions, often articulate, that give you a valuable heads-up in choosing from the dozens of alternatives for any Maui activity. Unlike so many guide books which simply list alternatives, this guide gives has the kinds of information that will enable you to choose and plan the activities for your valuable vacation. Reviews of tour operators, cruises, and beaches, with good driving directions, are terrific."
4,Hidden costs,"I do love the book and CD itself, the book is very thorough and has alot of excellent illustrations and reviewing material. I do wish the website services were free and was supported by AOL, but otherwise this is a fantastic book and thank you.Kindest Regards,Desiree Gallup"
2,Not that much articulation,"My title describes it. If you want full articulation, I do not reccomend this for you. The Lama Su figure can easily stand up, but the clone youth will need one of those star wars stands in order to stand. If you are a big Star Wars fan and does not mind lack of articulation, you could buy this if you want. These figures are meant to be looked at,not played.The only movable things for Lama Su are the arms and a little bit of the legs. For the clone youth, only the head and arms are movable."
5,boots,"ABSOLUTELY LOVE these boots. They're warm, extremely comfortable, and stylish, and I have received many compliments on them. And to think, I almost paid $200 for an over-rated brand name boot. These have become a fashion staple for me this winter."
4,Haunting and informative,"I read this book to get a glimpse into what would make ORDINARY individuals turn into effecient killing machines. I am brought up in a world where i look at crimes and say, ""How can people do that?"" So the point this book makes that anyone, including myself, is prone to this persuasion and moral altering is very powerful, and i found it interesting just how Himmler and his officials went about it."
4,Nice!,"Heavy duty. Nice feeling in your hand. If you're a typical ""tool loving man"" this will sweeten your day. A bit on the heavy side, but that's because it's made with thick metal - not like the flimsy stuff."
3,Too much for dummies,"The first thing I looked up was archiving. Couldn't find it. This book is TOO basic and doesn't seem to assume people will do much else EXCEPT get and receive ""pretty"" looking e-mail."
4,Works,"Well, I am an IT professional, I have had almost every brand of KVM switch out there, all work well with PS2 connectors. I have had bad experiences with all except for this one.Common problems with USB KVM switches, gets even worse if you use DVI+USB1- Keyboard and mouse and not recognized, hit and miss.2- Switching back and forth, causes keyboard and mouse problems.3- Weird mouse movements.4- Volume, special keys do not work.5- Monitor is not recognized, shows with a generic monitor with a very low resolution.6- Screen flicker.This one solved all these issues for me, I wish they made them in 8 ports, which what I needed.Advantaged for this specific KVM:All keyboard keys work. Volume, play, calculator! mail, internet all work. Which is niceMonitor is recognized, which sets up the resolution correctly.You can connect extra usb devices in the front and/or the back of the KVMNice build qualityCons:You can not switch via keyboard key combination, but they offer a remote control that can be used"
1,This thing just doesn't work,"this is one of 2 4-port KVM switches I bought. Neither one worked very well at all. I finally just unhooked it and threw it back into a box with the linksys.Oh, why did I buy 2? Because the first one didn't work so I bought another. When that one didn't work I figured out a way to use the 2 port KVM switch I started with."
5,Inspiring,This is a great read that will inspire you to move mountains or at the very least get up off your behind and pursue your dreams. I think it should be a must read for students and start at the vey least at the Jr H.S. level to begin showing them that they can shape their destiny starting now.
1,earphones don't work when swimming,"This was an expensive mistake. It's a good mp3 player and the case works fine... But the earphones don't work underwater. They are cones made of hard plastic with a short flange, too narrow to form a seal within the ear. As soon as water comes in, the sound is not audible."
3,Great Case-Headphones Stink,"I love my iRiver player, it's sounds great and easy to use. Dollar for dollar I don't think it can be beat. I live in Oregon and yard work involves being in the rain most of the year. I saw this case and headphone combo and had to get it. I thought of all of the hours I could spend in the yard and never run out of music and not worry about water damaging my player. I got my case and headphones and the headphones sound terrible. They are terribly uncomfortable to wear. There is nothing good about them. I've gone back to using my regular earbuds with a hat to protect them from rain. The case itself is great. I don't worry about bumping the player in the case and it WON'T get wet. Case 5 stars, Headphones 0 stars."
5,Most Excellent!,"I purchased the Book of 5 Rings and got the Audio CD because I am very busy, but wanted to read the book. This has changed my whole outlook on audio CD's! This is narrated perfectly clearly & easily understandable The cost impact is VERY agreeable and as it was I happened to go to their web site and these are the Greatest People I have ever met, I am even ordering more books from them as we speak. This was a Great Honest Experience and I urge all to enjoy these books .Thank YouSincerely.Jeffrey T. LopezChief Executive OfficerA New Hope For Tucson Foundation3537 E. Hardy DriveTucson, AZ 85716[...]Phone (520) 207-2595Cell (520) 406-3163Fax (520) 207-3085[...]"
5,Excellent!,"Renee has really outdone herself! I read her first collection of poetry titled, ""Tangled Web"" and was hooked. She writes beautifully and you can really relate to her words. Her words all flow well and her ideas are brought across eloquently. She is truly gifted. I suggest this book as well as her first one."
3,what you would expect of a floyd and techno mix,"From the perspective of a person who loves floyd and techno, this album's great. I think some of the artist are dry and can't pull out a good house beat but the trance tunes are great. Though the songs are completely different fromt the originals, it brings new and different levels to the music. Listen to it in a psychedelic state of mind and you'll understand. If you're looking for a more fundamental tribute or don't like techno, DO NOT BUY! If anyone knows where to find this album on 12"" vinyl records, let me know."
2,ummm,"as a huge floyd fan and electric remix fan, i was dissapointed after buying this cd, nowhere near as good as the ORB remixes more like pop remixes than trance, i wish i would have read the reviews on amazon before spending my money for a cd that i will only listen to very occasionally if i remember i have it"
4,Good stuff,This is an interesting book. A good companion for PMP certification. I warmly recommend it
5,Excellent prep guide,"If you are planning on sitting for the PMP exam, this is the prep guide for you! I've reviewed four or five other books, and this one stands out. The format is easy to follow; the nine knowledge areas are set up in a manner that makes the information easy to follow; the ""Notes"" area next to the Sample Assessment Exam makes it easy for the student to record their areas of weakness, so you can go back over those areas; and the authors even took the time to explain how long each section of the exam allows, the number of questions in each area, and the passing score.This is a must have for any individual wanting to study and sit for the PMP exam. It's a great resource, and lays out the information in a manner to provide the student the added advantage for ""PMP Exam Success""."
3,"Interesting, yet arrogant","This is a fascinating book, but sometimes it is hard to get past all the bragging and spelling errors. Ressler is a talented man, but he is a true blowhard and doesn't give the proper credit to those who deserve it. I found John Douglas to provide better examples of techniques and more specific details, where Ressler just glosses over everything. Ressler is good, but he is lucky that he hasn't broken his arm trying to pat himself on the back."
3,It's Ok...,"This book is written in kind of ""text book"" form. Overall it was pretty interesting, but Ressler spent alot of time patting himself on the back, which seem to drag the book on a little too much."
4,Very Good,"I agree with one of your reviewers who thought that some of the crime scene photos were not appropriate for this type of book. Of course, real life can be gruesome,bloody and not for the feint hearted. But one would be better to reveal this via the text."
4,Great Heel-Repair Roll-on,"While I've had and used these for about 2-3 weeks, my heels have seen improvement. The best part of this balm is that you don't have to touch it; it works like a roll-on so your hands don't get tacky. I use these after I shower at night and just before bed; these also work quicker if you wear a pair of socks after application. These have a faint medicinal scent. The directions say use twice daily, but I use it once @ night and not during the daytime."
3,"Why, Why, Why Include the Clunkers?","Naughton give a number of fine renditions, underlined by the pure masculinity of his voice. But why, why, why include the clunkers where his voice struggles, wavers, and downright fails? Seems some tone deaf mixer decided to throw everything -- the best and the worst -- onto to one disc and let it sink or swim. The failures so disappoint, the CD barely floats on the surface. What a shame!"
3,"Haven't Received Last Two Issues, Anyone Else?","I haven't received the 2/26/11 and 2/27/11 issues of the PD. Is anyone else having problems? Otherwise, I am very happy with the Kindle version of the Press Democrat."
4,Thought ...,"I just read Jonathan L Lewis's book, ""I THOUGHT WE WERE HAPPY: Lessons My Wife Taught Me on the Road to Divorce"". I wish I had read it first. I needed to heal the agonizing pain of my ex's affair before trying to save my marriage - and maybe then I could have rescued it. Ah well ..."
2,The weakest of the series,"Mankell had an idea, it seems, for a South African thriller, and shoehorned Wallander and Sweden into it for some reason. Wallander seems inconsequential to the plot, and the Mandela/DeKlerk/South Africa parts now seem badly dated. For completists only, I think."
2,Good then bad then good,"I liked this book from the start to somewhere around page 250 or 260. But I thought it faltered pretty badly for a hundred pages or so. Fellow police are shocked that a man just seconds from a gun battle for his life is in a frantic frame of mind. Really? A man he's chasing seems to, inexplicably, feel that it's important to get Wallander. Why? Reasons are purported but they seemed very false. It helped the story along but it was faintly ridiculous. There was a little too much sentimentality in stereotypically expected ways."
4,The White Lioness,"A very well written novel; kept me reading, I did not want to put the book down , and now want to read more Kurt Wallander novels."
3,Hoped for more,"I felt the writing was choppy in some areas and the book dragged a bit. Overall, wasn't as impressed as with other Swedish writers like Stieg Larsson."
2,Not as good as the first season,"The first season was passable, though straying from the book's story often. The second season is very scary and not suitable for some children at all - or adults! Some of the characters such as the gypsy, Uncle Thom, Mrs. Kent and others are very scary. The story line strays so far from the actually books it is astounding. Though there are a few episodes which are not this bad, some are absurd such as the final episode with the all the varying ways Aunt Laura's wedding might turn out but we don't know which it is. I guess this is to get people to ""cliffhang"" until the 3rd season. It's really a shame because the books themselves are so classy."
1,Not Suitable for Children,"I bought this for my seven grandchildren to view having not seen Season 1 or 2. I only bought Season 2. I saw that it was by L M Montgomery and assumed she wrote similar stories as Ann of Green Gables. Not true! This series is dark, reckless, scary, etc. Every character's faults are exaggerated beyond belief. The only character who resembles Ann of Green Gables characters is the Dad who is a ghost, or a figment of Emily's imagination. Emily does not have any stability or adult supervision so she runs wild, more or less, and is the one who takes care of the adults in her life.My daughter did not want her children to see this. Now, that I have seen three episodes of Season 2, I know why."
1,Didn't work for me,"Unfortunately, the device I was sent did not work. The picture was black and white with lines running through it.I needed something functional quickly so rather than wait for a replacement, I went to Radio Shack and purchased the device they sell to perform this conversion function. The Radio Shack device worked perfectly.Guess I just got a bad one of these devices.Thanks to Amazon, the return process was very easy. So it was not a big problem."
4,Nice accent to bathroom,"I didn't need anything fance or that would get too grungy all the time, so I purchased this to fill that void. I don't regret this buy by any means. It's pretty sturdy when tightened and is a simple addition to any bathroom for a cheap price."
5,Easy to clean,This is cute and very easy to clean. I never had one that did not get scumnmy and moldy looking after a while and we have been using this constantly.
4,Magic,"This book was the first of Gemmels novels I came across, and I have read most of them since. Gemmel's storylines are very standard as far as fantasy is concerned, yet he writes with a certain flair which makes his books extremely enjoyable nonetheless. I loved this book from the start and I would highly recommend this book as an entry into Gemmel's Drenai world."
3,Why only 7 new songs,"I still feel that Doug's debut was among the best country albums of all time and was looking forward to this one. It's a mystery to me why there are so few songs on here after such a long hiatus.In the world of Brooks and Dunns, Brad Paisleys and Tim McGraws there should be a lot more people making music like Doug Stone.Why aren't they being played on ""country"" radio?"
4,Great old monster movies!,"I'm a sucker for the old classic black and white monster movies and these two are just perfect if you like that kind of movie. There's nothing like a giant spider chasing you, or a giant man with an agenda ticked off at the world! Sure they're corny by today's standards, but that's part of their charm and they are great entertainment. Safe for the family also - no swear words, nudity, etc. What a refreshing change!"
3,I bought this one for the spider movie since I already have the colossal beast.,"The spider does have some scary parts that im sure any kid will enjoy. And my Wife sure liked the movie. And the Colossal beast is also really good. But you need to see the 1st movie ""The Colossal Man"" to see how he got that way. All and all its a good pair for the price."
4,Entertaining for Small Children,"Although the video does depart from the book, the story and songs are very entertaining. My daughter is 2 years old and loves it... in fact I've heard her singing along with some of the songs. I enjoy it too, and this is important because I usually have to see it/hear it over and over and over...."
4,Not perfect but pretty good product,I used this product several times to lower some really high nitrate levels in my tank. It does a pretty good job. The only thing I don't like is that you have to replace it every 5 days which means shutting off my canister filter and opening it up and replacing it. That's the only down side to it.
4,Interesting account,"The author took me for a trip down ""memory lane"" of like 2,000 years on how people have used mathematics, in this instance - number theory, throughout the ages from the European to the Hindu civilizations. The book also examines the different methods developed by different cultures to achieve the same goal, that is to be able to count stuff and its derivatives.I think this book is what is missing in our education system w.r.t math i.e. a historical understanding of the evolution of modern-day math; since most of us learn mathematics by rote and i dare say none of us wonder how did the math as we knew today came?"
5,Excellent resource,"Based on my pastor's recommendation I purchased, read and highly recommend the same for anyone seeking to lead a small group or study. It covers so much that is of use to the beginning leader and would be an excellent review for a seasoned lead."
1,Don't waste your money,"I am so disappointed in my 325. It prints beautiful photos from my memory stick, however, I couldn't install it on my computer.I called cust. service and they couldnt' help me either.I enlisted help from family and friends and no one can get this thing installed. I keep getting a message that says there is no software to install the hardware!So, try another brand. I""m going to."
4,fun ball,"This is a regular beach ball with a globe printed on it. The only disappointment was that the poles are covered, so one piece of the globe is missing (part of Antartica). I bought this globe for a preschooler for Christmas. He likes to play with it and asks simple questions about where we live. It was worth the price and seems sturdy (he throws himself onto it regularly as if it were an exercise ball). It is a beach ball though, I am sure it will not put up with too much abuse! This was a cheap alternative to the super fancy earth balls you can buy. In my case, our preschooler would not appreciate, need, or otherwise understand a satilite imaged ball or a real globe, so this was a nice choice."
3,"Same old, same old...","After reading the Dakota series, I thought I would try another of Stephanie Grace Whitson's series'. While I enjoyed the ending of Book 1, the first 150 pages were a rerun from the Dakota series. The only redeeming point is that I loved Books 2 & 3. In fact, they were by far, my favorite books by this author."
2,Disappointed,"This book is not the ""Ultimate"" encyclopedia of cats, because it is missing many cat breeds! It does have large photos of the more common breeds of cats, although some of the cat models are not the best. I've seen much better Snow Shoe cat photos in other books. This book doesn't include the Siberian Cat, which has been in the United States from Russia since the early 1990's. It certainly doesn't include the newer cat breeds such as the Pixie Bob, etc."
5,Neighbor's Son?,This movie was a real life saver. I never fully comprehended the magnitute and scope of those who suffer from mental illness. I reccomend this movie to any parent and professional alike.
4,Good buy,"This product was just what I needed to use my Motorhome generator as a backup to the house in the winter. Only need to connect my furnaces, microwave and freezer circuits to it. Works great!"
5,Leaking auto A/C,"I was in the automotive market all my working years. I have sold many Four Seasons products and never had a complaint about the name. To get this item from Amazon, it not only saved me a lot, compared to all the local auto parts stores, it also took care of my A/C on my auto."
2,"Should be called ""Six Sigma for Dummies (sans cartoons)""","Overall, the quality of this book is adequate, provided you aren't expecting a thorough treatment. That, in itself, would've rated it three stars if there wasn't one mitigating factor - in reading this book, one could (easily) assume the Juran Group (or Juran himself) invented Six Sigma, and nothing could be further from the truth. (As best as I know, it was Bob Gavin, in 1988.)Egoism drops the rating to two stars.This book is a good basic overview - nothing more. Save yourself the grief (and money!) and buy the Pyzdek book instead."
1,Yoda Christmas tree topper,"The company in which this product came from was great. It was sent fast and packaged well. It came slightly damaged and for the quality of this item, I think the price is too high."
4,I Smell a Success,"I am in love with both her voice and this song. It is catchy and she sounds wonderful; I hope this is a sign of things to come (off of her album)! I give it a 4 because parts of the song are lacking, but generally a likeable song."
1,"Just ok, Hope she can do better on her album!!!","Not impressed with this single, does not sound like the Kim on American Idol."
4,how to make random numbers,"Tezuka offers a pragmatic approach to the generation of random numbers in a uniform distribution. While there is certainly a decent amount of theory in his book, it is primarily for someone who needs to code a generator. And who might not be so concerned about understanding the underlying aspects of number theory.The book also offers various methods that show how to measure the random nature of its algorithms.For a broad theorectical framework, perhaps the earlier book by Donald Knuth, ""The Art of Computer Programming"", offers the best overview."
1,wayyyyyyyyyy too expensive!!!,It sells for half everywhere else.....how sad is this kind of sheenanigan!!
1,Something fishy,Cold Steel Suggested Retail Price for this knife is 199.00 not 299.00 as suggested and reduced to 199.00.... so it is definately false advertising on the part of Sword Demon.
5,Music for the Gypsies at Heart!,"I can't stop listening to this CD. I listen to it in my car, snap it into my CD-Rom, before I go to bed, when I wake up... It is a great compilation of Flamenco Music with relatively unknown / commercial artists. You must get it! It makes a great backdrop to any party, it will bring the gypsy out of you."
4,LITTLE KNOWN FACTS ARE WORTH KNOWING,"Professor Steve Ropp, Director, International Studies Program, University of Wyoming, wrote the following about this book in January 1994:""I found The Panamanian Problem interesting and particularly insightful with regard to the political reasons behind the breakdown of negotiations with General Noriega in May of 1988."""
5,It's A Glove,What can you say about a glove? It fits well and it keeps my hand protected. Would definitely purchase again (only one more since I have one bare hand).
4,Great Fun,"Earlier this morning I panned a novel, and realized that I read books I enjoy also. This is one of the good ones. I'm in favor of people, especially women, being able to earn a living by writing, and in doing so, their writing should give readers something in return. This book pays a return, so read it. It was fun, and it also had things to say that really ring true about life. I'm looking forward to the author's next book."
4,pretty nice,"This deck is a good deck. With some cards added it could become a real ALO deck. It requires patience to pull off its main stragety, which is to get either neo daedelus on the field, or to use ALO and gravity bind to play powerful level 4 monsters to attack your opponent while they can't attack. Just don't think you can win with just the deck. DO NOT add water dragon the legendary fisherman orca mega fortress of darkness des frog and terrorking salmon. AND DO NOT ADD FORTRESS WHALE!!!!!"
5,These women were tough!,"This is an excellent book on the history of women during the gold rush period in Northern California. The book is a series of short biographies about several women who were key to the formation of the west as we know it today. Their successes and failures, hope and despair are all well chronicled - but kept brief and easy to read. Woven into the stories are issues that women faced, like the right to vote and working to support their families. You get a good feel for day to day life during this period. This book is inspirational for anyone today who thinks that like is hard, and would provide excellent supplemental reading for high school and college history courses. It has been painstaking researched, with information on how to learn even more."
1,Wrong Book,"You sent me the wrong book - I wanted another book by the same name, but written by Markus Wolf, former hed of Est German Intelligance (""Stasi"")."
3,The Man Without a Face,"I recomend this book to any age group, but I think in order to really like it you have to be adventures. I liked this book even though it wasn't really my type of story. Over all I think this is a really good book and I recomend you take it out next time you are at your libary."
1,stunning,"What's stunning is not how good it is, but how different it is from the movie. I read this because I enjoyed the movie and thought I'd read the novel on which it was made (didn't realize it was a novel for pre-teens).In the movie, the whole thing about Mr. McCleod's character having inappropriate contact with his young charges is technically left unresolved, although it's clearly implied the charges were false. The book, however, is not ambiguous: Mr. McCelod did. At least this is my judgment. The scenes are graphic, and the author's not really condemnatory about it at all.I sent I a notification to Amazon about this, citing chapter and verse from the text, but they ignored my communication and, to my amazement, are still selling it."
3,Missing Some Great Songs,"I love this band. They were one of the best 80s' bands. They wrote great songs and has some incredible musical ability.Too bad this ""Best Of"" collection is lacking more than a few great songs. The tracks ""Big Guns"", ""Sweet Little Sister"", ""Makin A Mess"" and ""Midnight Tornado"" should have been put on here in place of the mediocre songs from ""Subhuman Race"", which I did not like. Like Warrant, this band had two good albums. Then they tried to conform to the growing popularity of ""alternative"" and lost their touch. And now Sebastian Bach is out of the band. I feel that, like Warrant, this once great band's best work is behind them. A shame, really."
1,Why only one star?,"This is a good collection of your favorite Skid Row songs and for those of you who have been waiting for some new tunes, Forever and Fire in the Hole will definitly fill your rock n roll appitite. Then why does it only get a rating of one, you ask? Well because Baz is no longer part of Skid Row and they suck without him. I reccommend you buy Sebastian Bach's album instead. He does Skid tunes plus a few rockin new ones."
1,Bad call...the band is bitter but Seb is better,"I really thought the disc was bad. Seriously, I thought something was wrong with it. I pulled out my original cd's and compared and I swear that they [messed] this disc up.Not to mention that the remix stuff is really terribly [messed] up. Was Sebastian the only one in the band that could hear? The bass is so loud in the mix you need to turn it down to play it. BTW Dont even go their I have top of the line equipment.Bottomline, its worth it if you are a fan and want some unreleased material. Otherwise it [stinks]!!Badvox"
3,It's Good... But Could Have Been Great...,"This is definitely an excellent compilation of Skid Row's best hits, but I don't understand how they (apparently Rachel Bolan) could have left off ""Wasted Time"". Perhaps it is just personal preference or my own taste, but that is my favorite Skid Row song. It's a hard-rocking song that tugs at you like a ballad. It was a big mistake leaving this off of the album!"
3,It's OK,"This is an estes rocket that is mostly styrofoam (not balsa wood). it is very fragile and you could probably get 4-8 good launchings out of it before it breaks. it doesn't go too far up -- which is good in my mind.kids think the design is really cool, but they are invariably too rough with the model and it is so fragile, it breaks easily. i've had a lot of success with the parachute and find that it opens 80% of the time. When it doesn't, the plane often lands without damage."
4,Question,I was about to buy this when I listened to the samples and I swear the voices here sound much different than in the film. Has this been re-recorded does anyone know?
3,Folkeys Delight,"Having never seen the ""Wicker Man"" film, I came to the soundtrack strictly through the buzz it received in the music press upon its discovery and issue. So I had no preconceptions, I just looked at it as a piece of music. For the uninitiated like myself, the Paul Giovanni tracks, 1-11, will hold the most interest. They are a mixture of solid Gordon Lightfoot/Cat Stevens-ish folk tunes, English pub rave ups, traditional Irish fare, and a few surprises (one track with a Christopher Lee vocal). The standout tracks are ""Corn Rigs"" (which I'm convinced Sting had in mind when he wrote ""Fields of Gold"") and the utterly beautiful ""Gently Johnny"". The rest is a bit dissappointing in comparison (Christopher Lee's quote ""I think it is probably the best music I've ever heard in a film,"" is a bit of an overstatement), but ""The Wicker Man"" is still a worthy curio addition to your collection. For what its worth, I'm now excited to see the film itself."
2,Not what I expected,"This book is OK if you want to read about all the stupid things that someone on drugs does. I just couldn't get in to the book. The writing style was sophomoric and the story just seemed shallow.At the end, the author has a note that a portion of the proceeds from this book (if any) will go towards spinal research. By adding ""if any"", I get the impression that he knows that the book isn't that great, but that we'll hopefully feel better about buying the book because we're contributing to spinal research."
4,I liked it a lot...,"I just received this movie yesterday, and couldn't get it open to watch it fast enough. I love, love, love, the Noah's Arc series; I own both seasons, and just had to have the movie. I was glad to see the original actors from the series, back for the movie. If anyone is a Noah's Arc fan like I am, I think this movie is a must have."
4,Sex in the City for Men,"I loved this movie, it really made you think about things before getting married and making a committment. It was real life to me.."
3,Not as good as the hype.,"I may be the only one who doesn't give this movie a good score - but it's truly how I feel. Before you write me off as someone who just bought the movie and doesn't know anything, you should know that I am a die-hard Noah's Arc fan since the beginning; I was devastated when I found out the movie wasn't released here. I asked the people who saw it, was it a good movie, and everyone told me they loved it. In all actuality, it's a pretty good movie and worth buying if you're a die-hard, but as far as expectations go...the movie let me down. The storyline is just too far fetched as far as I'm concerned, and in one little weekend all the characters are doing too much."
4,Noah's Arc: Jumping the Broom,the product was great but it would have been better if it were received quicker
1,A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT,This so-called movie was a major disappointment. It was slow moving and the director must have thought that he was producing a television episode.It had all the look and feel of an extended television episode-The acting is good but the film (?) is predictable and ever so slow.Would somebody please tell the director that television is a completely different medium to cinema and to learm the basics before making another film.
5,Give Jacki a Chance,"First of all i was a skeptic about the album when i first heard it. I really didnt like it at first, but once you really listnen to it you hear that jacki is great. Her cd is great, she's no trina, but thats not really a bad thing. She is great she has her own style and rythmn and the way she delivers. My favorite songs are basically the whole album. you can put the cd on and just listen to it she has a song for every mood you may be in. One of my favorite lines that she has is ""F*ck yo' family and yo phony ass mami"" that bitch is real and raw. thats why i love me some jacki. give her a chance you'll surely like the album. Btw..her and trina are cool now. oh yeah i think jacki and trina need to do some songs together..they would then be the real queens of the south. Hold it down Jacki!"
5,A few kind words and a loaded gun,"A thrilling read and a brutally honest insight to the mind of a career criminal.Noel Razor Smith took me on a journey,experiencing the highs and lows of armed robbery and violence. Never before have I felt as effected from a book.Truly fascinating read!!!Highly recommended!!!"
4,Purrfect Choice,"I loved this book. I'm still filling in different sections as 'Shmoo', my British Shorthair feline companion grows & has more 'tails' to tell. The journal is beautifully illustrated but difficult to stick photos in & it's a shame to have to write over the pictures. However, it's the best journal of its kind I could find."
1,False Advertisement Plain and Simple,"DO NOT buy this product, the picture and description is simply misleading, period. For almost $60, all we got was 5 pieces of plastic and nothing else, when the web said this would be a starter set and the picture included the base for the folders. Customer service from this company the proceeded to blame Amazon for putting up the incorrect picture and description and I had to pay the shipping charges on top of that to return it. AND I still do not have a credit for the pruchase back on my credit card. What gives guys?????"
1,Disappointing,"I don't have the greatest SACD library but when I purchase such a product I expect it to at least sound better than a CD. This did not. The sound quality was extremely poor and tinny lacking any of the depth befitting of a orchestral arrangement. I couldn't even get through ""Imperial March"". I felt cheated but hopefully my Amazon refund arrives soon. I tested this CD on a Sony XA4500ES, Matrix M-Stage headphone amp, and Sennheiser HD 800."
4,Tranquil Moods,"music is relaxing. I actually bought this as a retirement gift because the person had listened to my own set and really enjoyed it. Worth sharing. Makes a nice gift when you want to escape from daily stress.Turn off the cell phone, disconnet the blue tooth, don't answer the door, light a candle, pour a glass of wine and shut out the world."
1,Buyer Beware!,"Because of other ""Moods"" CD's, I bought this without listening to the tracks first. As soon as I heard the first track on the first CD, I knew I was in for an unpleasant surprise...and I wasn't wrong. There wasn't one song that didn't grate on my nerves. I am certainly sorry that I didn't pay more attention before buying."
2,Battery compartment and battery usage are real problems,"I bought this headlamp because of the high lumen rating and I could use rechargeable 3-volt CR123A batteries which I already owned. BIG PROBLEM: the battery compartment can only be opened and closed using a screwdriver and the way this lamp eats batteries you will be using that screwdriver a lot. Also, Radio Shack was a source for rechargeable CR123A batteries and the charger and they now seem to be deleting both from their product list. In most other respects this is a well-made product using top grade materials. It is guaranteed to be waterproof to a depth of one meter but the seals make the battery compartment very hard to open and close. SOLUTION: buy a different headlamp that uses easy-to-find AA or AAA batteries and be sure you can change those batteries without using tools."
4,Bright light,Great light with 6 settings. On the highest setting the amount of light put out is amazing but it does drain the CR123's pretty quickly. On the lowest setting light is still ample and the batteries last a long time. I use this backpacking and riding. Had a problem with the battery case cracking but contacted princeton and it was replaced quickly.I use rechargeable Cr123's when I am using the light alot.
5,- Amazing -,"Extremely quiet, portable and no power cables involved. It is also quite sturdy. Add an MP3 playback feature and that will be the end of iPods :)"
2,Broke on me :(,"I had this drive for about 6-9 months before the stupid thing gave out on me. In my opinion, this should have lasted well over 2 years to be a worthwhile investment. The drive got corrupted from normal wear and tear. I recommend going with either another drive or preferably another company altogether. I no longer trust WD's quality."
2,Warning!!!!! cypress AT2Lp RC42: will work for a while??,"This Drive performed superbly for a few weeks, then upon plugging into the USB port the computer would begin to ask for a driver; specifically a driver for ""cypress AT2Lp RC42"" which of course does not exist. The manufacturer was unable to help but agreed to replace the item. Not so bad?? Well data recovery costs about $400-500 on this type of drive, that is if data recovery is at all possible. I'm not sure if this is specific to this brand, but beware Western Digital's customer service isn't really much of a service."
4,Easy way to keep files save or transfer,"I love this device. I was going to get a large size USB, but I need more space to move files or keep them backed up. This Passport is great. I can back up all of ""my documents folder"" so that incase my PC dies, I'm covered. Plus I take hundreds of digital photos and if my drive fails, all my photos are gone. with the passport I'm protected. its a bit slow on the transfer rate, but the ability to hold them in such a small compact drive it great. Also, it needs no power other than the usb, so its very simple to use. As for some of the features the software brings. I had trouble loading it, and I have not had a chance to re-try loading it, I just back up complete items instead of using the sync. function that will only back up the new stuff."
1,another islamophobic rant,"I picked up the book thinking Mr. Blankley may have something new to offer. But it's another of the Islamophobic books, meant to pander the right wingers and the haters. Good for Mr. Blankley, he will surely make some money. Bad for the country, he is not the last one to spread hatred.I always wonder what makes these haters hate another group of people so much that they can say or do anything against that group of people."
4,Yay,"I received this book in a timely fashion, great condition, and have been challenged by its content through this spring semester."
5,A great trilogy,"If you're looking for another great trilogy to read, this is it. It's clean, doesn't slow down, and has great characters. A must read."
3,It Came From The Fifties,"Diversionary entertainment from the Fifties. Two of the ""best"" B-grade movies from the era. ""How To Make A Monster"" belongs in everyone's horror collection beside ""House On Haunted Hill,"" ""Plan 9 From Outer Space,"" and another one of Samuel Arkoff's ""masterpieces,"" ""The Creature With The Atom Brain"" ""Blood of Dracula,"" while not as good as ""How To Make A Monster,"" is a great example of how the emerging culture of teenagers influenced horror movies--think of this as a super B-grade version of ""Rebel Without A Cause"" and a companion piece to ""I Was A Teenage Werewolf""."
4,works well,"I bought these to use on my eyeglasses and computer screen and keyboard. no streaks, no issues, I would buy them again."
4,Flents Wipe N Clear 100 wipes,The wipes do an excellent job at cleaning eyeglass lenses and computer screens. I have given the wipes a 4 rating because occasionally I will run into a wipe that is not sufficiently moistened. The wipes are larger and more effective than Bausch & Lomb wipes.
4,riverworld's dark design,"Nothing new here. The same overlong third part of the, now, five part story of Riverworld. However, the larger page format and sturdy stock make this an easier read than the usual ""pocketbook"" publications. It's a welcome replacement for my original, lost (?) copy.."
3,don't know,"I'm sure this item is fine. It was given to my daughter and I found out she hates working out, though was on a college team. I doubt she ever used it. You have to know what you need."
4,Red Soils a charmer,"Both humorous and heartbreaking, M.G. Visram's book artfully evokes a time never to be repeated. Filled with tales of big game hunters, marauding elephants and misadventures high and low, Red Soils of Tsavo is also a keenly felt memorial to friendships ended far too early and a paen to a wild and difficult land. This tale of two brother's struggle to run a 10,000 acre plantation in one of the last untamed places on Earth is a must-read for anyone even remotely interested in Kenya' s recent past."
2,"Landvik's Great Mysterious, NOT mysrterious","But predictable and like a bad soap opera. I love Landvik's books, and was surprised and dissapointed in this book. Gone were her wonderfuland loveable chatacters I found in Patty Jane's house of Curl,Your Oasis on Flame Lake and The Tall Pine Polka.Those 3 books made me laugh, cry and care. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen, especially in Patty Janes house of Curl. The Great Mysterious was almst trite, with your big New York star, having to go to a small town to help her sister with her down syndrom child..She falls in love, or is she ???? A friend of the childs becomes seriously ill...we didn't even know he had this problem...our main character goes back to New York, where a part just happens to be waiting for her, or is it....them back to the small town and I felt like going blah blah blah. I missed and longed for ""the gang from the hairdressers, or the resteraunt, or the Oasis. I hope Lanvik goes back to thta style of writing..........."
3,"Better than her last, but nowhere as fine as her first 2!","I absolutely loved ""Patty Jane's House of Curl"" and ""Your Oasis on Flame Lake"". But what's happened to Lorna's writing? ""The Tall Pine Polka"" was like a car accident...you don't want to look, but you feel compelled to. The characters in that book were so unbelievable (only a Minnesotan could come up with a movie title like ""Ike and Inga""), I had to finish the book to discover how much more conviluted the story would become. But enough of the Polka.""Welcome to the Great Mysterious"" is a slight improvement. The relationship between Conrad and Rich was wonderful, but I just couldn't see this self-indulgent, self-centered ""Toast of Broadway"" becoming such fast friends with the woman down the street with the bad perm. I don't want to give the plot away, but unlike ""Patty Jane"" and ""Oasis"", the story line is predictable, and, like Lite Beer...less filling, but tastes, uh, okay."
4,An Enjoyable Read,"In her newest book, Lorna Landvik explores relationships. The love between twin sisters, lovers old and new and the most touching of all, between two disabled teens who show everyone the meaning of unconditional love. Geneva finds the true meaning of life in an old trunk where she discovers a childhood memory book, The Great Mysterious. Through the eyes of her nephew Rich she rediscovers what is important in her life. Though at times predictable I enjoy the way this book evokes emotion, humor and sadness, totally an easy and enjoyable read."
3,"Okay, but not a, must re-read","This book was okay, fairly predictable. It was a pleasant few hours, but is isn't a book I set aside to read again. I love serious fiction, like Cold Mountain, Memoirs of a Geisha, Harry Potter. I really dislike formulatic romance, and I found this book to be only a notch above pulp romance."
3,"I haven't used it, but I'm sure it works well","This would be good for building a custom computer case. However, for the price of this thing, you might as well make your own switch with a momentary power button and a power sw extension by soldiering the two pieces together."
4,track listing,"From what I heard of these song samples, this album seems pretty tight. I'll probably buy it tomorrow but why are there only 12 songs listed and reviewers are saying there's 14 songs on the album."
5,How a true GodFather thinks about his world,Mr.Joseph T. Bonanno has written a great book about his world.A once honorable society.He had been a GodFather in.And about how it has now been truned into something other than it's supposed to be.In the last years the so-called men of honor have truned it into something diffrent.
4,"Self-serving, yet illuminating...","Of course, he doesn't tell about the times he had to order that someone be ""whacked."" But he does go deeper than any other ""Mafia memoirs"" such as _The Valachi Papers_ ever did.Or did he? Towards the end, I began wondering if, in his effort to portray himself merely as a misunderstood Sicilian businessman, his book proved that Mario Puzo had done extensive research for _The Godfather_, or if Bonanno had simply used that saga to explain the Mafia's history.Either way, it's very readable, and very entertaining."
4,Complete book,"I really enjoyed this book. I didn't know much about the War of 1812 or the period in general, but ""The War of 1812"" is extremely informative. The book covers every aspect of the war in great detail, especially when it comes to economics factors that lead Madison to push for a war declaration. The only thing a reader may not enjoy is that the book doesn't go chronologically. Some chapters go back and discuss aspects of the war that took place during or before events discussed in the last chapter. While this arrangement lets the author focus on a single topic at a time, it can be confusing. This is especially true in the closing chapters. All in all, this is a very informative book and a nice read. I would recommend it to the casual historian."
3,Curious,The cover is a curious change from the original. Wasn't the present version more or less used in another 1812 book a couple of years ago?
3,I did not enjoy reading this book.,"Though I thoroughly enjoyed the anecdotes and the opportunity to hear from other Asian American women, I did not like the summarizations that Eng made from the stories. Many of her statements seem like soundbites, rather cheesy, contrived, and holier-than-thou. She says things that we already know and tells us what we should do (stand up for ourselves, live for ourselves, etc.), making everything sound simple and easy. The book be much better if it had less advice --which it is filled with-- and more dialogue, communication in which I am treated as an equal. It felt very much like she was preaching, dispensing a step-by-step recipe for a picture-perfect life. I understand that weaving the stories together is necessary and drawing a theme from the many life experiences encountered is useful. However, I learned little from what Eng wrote and found her remarks tedious to labor through."
3,The big let down,"I had this printer just short of 1 yr and I loved it. Totally loved it! It began saying the paper was jammed as it would only take the paper in half way. I worked with HP on this for a long while when they sent me a ""refurbished printer"" to replace mine. I was happy for 2 1/2 months. Then this new printer began doing EXACTLY the same thing - it alternates between paper jammed and cartridges stuck!. I contacted HP again but this time my warranty is up as they only honor the original purchase date, not the replacement. So, I'm stuck with quite a few ink cartridges (2 of each) and no printer. I am hesitating buying another HP but what other printer is out there ??????? I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRINTER AS I BELIEVE THERE IS A DEFECT IN THE MANUFACTURING OF IT AND THEN THE CUSTOMER IS STUCK!"
1,Becoming outdated and outrated ?,"The book had been a solid handbook for hydraulic engineers, although it was never an easy book for students. As an experienced lecturer, I feel that Chow's book is everything but pedagogic. I would not recommend it to young professionals and students.Further it has become outdated with the years. For example, the section on spilwlays (Part IV) is no longer the state of the art. The material is also presented in imperial units. In my opinion, a number of very good books are now on the market and they fullfil the needs of professionals and students. For example the ""Hydraulics of Open Channel Flow"", ASCE Publ. is a solid reference, while ""The Hydraulics of Open Channel Flow: an Introduction"", Butterworth-Heinemann, is a very good student text.I am very surprised by some reviews that forgot the age and deficiencies of the book."
2,Only worked for 3 months,"At first I was thrilled with this mount- it is tons better than the one which came with the unit. I bought it in June and by September the suction cup no longer suctions to the windshield. I cannot understand how it would lose suction, but I tried everything."
3,Medicine + history = thoughtful entertainment,"I really enjoyed this volume, but you won't if you're not fond of the academic history stlye. There are charts, and frequently the text is a detailed discussion of the charts, but if you can work through/skip over those parts this is a worthwhile read.Through one non-urban, but not-exactly-rural doctor's life Duffin gets at the development of medicine and thoughts about disease in a ""normal"" community. You get to see a doctor get educated, to watch cutting-edge science trickle down to the local level, and to see what keeps a small-town doctor financially afloat when medical bills weren't as weighty as they are today.What you won't get is intimately involved with the good doctor Langstaff. This isn't the volume for character psychology--it's about medicine, education, and science."
5,Greatest OS Introduction,"This book is a true computer science classic and will never go out of print. It is the greatest introduction to operating systems there is. I lived for years with a 5th generation photocopy and i am very glad to own a new, clear copy.Buy it, study it, learn... give it to your children."
5,The Evaporator Core Worked- A-OK,"The Evaporator Core Worked- It Took a Long Time to Finally Fix this problem, and now I would like to thank Amazon for this Good Deal!"
4,So ended the Roman Army after almost 2 thousand years of service,"If one wants to get a good quick overview of the Fall of the once Great City of Constantinople to the Turks.Then one could do a whole lot worse than this thin little book. The only real problem that the whole story can not be told in just 80 pages. But if you want to know about the siege and sack of the city, then here you go.It does a good job tellings of Constantine XI, his forces and the Sultan and his troops. Its a sad story that was a disaster for Eastern Europe and shifted the center of power to the Atlantic States of Europe."
3,A good overview,"This is a nicely layed out book, with some interesting illustrations. It sheds light on a tragic history, that is the final end of the Roman Empire. Having studied this era in school and on my own, I think it presents an incomplete, and, in places one-sided picture. I think the terrible sack of the city and destruction of western art is underplayed. But all in all, a good read."
3,Complementary readings to Lynn's book,"There are already several good reviews to this book, so I will only suggest reading the following books in addition to Lynn's book: 1) above all, ""War in human civilization"" by Azar Gat; 2) ""War before Civilization. The Myth of the Peaceful Savage"", by Lawrence Keeley; 3) ""How War Began"" by Keith F. Otterbein; and 4) ""War and Peace and War: The Rise and Fall of Empires"" by Peter Turchin."
5,Great Kids Book,"We Love This Book ! With the space shuttle being on the news so much, my 4 year old daughter became interested in space. We got this book for her and now she wants us to read it every night."
2,Bad condition.,"The packaging looked old, as if it was the cd that was at the bottom of the pile. The cd case was broken too!!"
5,Good book,I loved this book. It is poetically brutal. Reminds me of dark era when mankind was yet to settle. This book takes us in that era. And so contemporary and relevent it is even today.
5,Gorgious,Frans is so cute. I have a few clips and can't get tired of looking and listening to him. He is a great performer. I'm a fan since 1998 and listen to his music every day. He is a Netherland's artist. He sings in dutch and german. This cd is great. All the tracks are very good
3,"Item only found online. Likely never used, but quite musty smelling.","Vendor should store items properly and not list as ""brand new, never used"". Book smells very musty."
2,Questionable Cuddl Dud,I have purchased and worn several Cuddl Dud clothing items and been pleased with the product. Recently I ordered 3 of the Camisole type under shirts. One of the three was fine and consistent with the quality of prior purchases. Two were of poor quality with sloppy cut and assembly. The trade mark was printed instead of sewn in. The items gave the impression of being Knock-Off items. I had to take some tucks in an attempt to correct the cut. All of the information from the seller gave no indication that there was any difference in the items. I would not buy from the Amazon seller again.
1,"Poorly written, factually incorrect","Mr. Shapiro never successfully draws any connections between the purported culture of moral decay that exists today, and actual social harms. In the last fifteen years, teenage pregnancy has sharply declined. Abortion rates have plunged. Homicide rates have fallen dramatically. Teenage STD rates have been reduced. By most accounts, we live in a safer and more secure America than the one which existed in 1990, or 1980, or even 1970. All of this despite the supposedley deleterious culture of moral decay decried by Mr. Shapiro.He is young, so hopefully he will learn about such things as providing evidence and avoiding tautological arguments by the time he writes his next book, which I'm sure is on the way."
1,Take Notice!,"If having ""perverted sex"", is turning us into idiots, it's a real shame that abstaining from said perverted sex doesn't seem to be making some of these reviewers any smarter. Also, question.R. Vallejo ""John Ruh"" states that ""To be involved with any type of sex(including sex by yourself) outside of marriage is perversion.""Does this mean that post-marital ""sex by yourself"", is okay? Gee Wiz! I sure hope I'm not offending Jesus or anything. I want to be living it up in the after life with Christ and Bill O'Reilly, not burning in Hell with all those perverts, and even worse, liberals!Please answer my question ASAP, it's urgent."
1,Seiko 450 label printer,"The printer works fine but don't plan on using it with any other networked printers! I performed this experiment TWICE and got the same result: installation of the printer software completely disables the use of any other network printers and the fix is NOT easy as it required a complete hard drive reimage! As far as I am concerned, the printer driver/software is a VIRUS! DO NOT INSTALL IT! The driver messes up the computer BIOS wreaking havok with trying to install or print to any other printers! The only way to get the driver completely removed and thus allow you to install other printers is to start over from scratch by reimaging.In addition, the Seiko technical service was of little help. I tried installing the updated version of the printer driver/software from the Seiko website but to no avail - same virus-like issue.Obviously, I would NOT recommend this printer unless you only intend to use it as your sole dedicated computer printer."
4,Makes office work easier,"My office primarily uses these for mailing labels. They print quickly and easily, and there's not the hassle of trying to print a whole page of labels. I bought this to replace one that my coworker had used almost ten years without a problem. Great product."
4,Smart Label Printer 450,Solid performance and relatively easy to use but plastic construction is less sturdy than previous models of this printer. Supplies easy to find and install. Would purchase again.
1,...,"I didn't understand this game at all... Couldn't get the story, couldn't get the characters, couldn't get the controls or gameplay... I just did not have fun with this game at all. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
3,Fun book,I would recommend this to a young new horse enthusiast. My daughter loved reading it before getting her first horse.
4,Amazing results,"I thought the claims couldn't be true of stronger nails; however, it works for me. After using the Healthy Hand and Nail Lotion for a short while, I stopped and then began again to test the truth of the claim. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because Vaseline is stopping the production of the larger size bottle that is/was on the market."
3,Poor Quality,"Typical of the early 60's the quality of the video and sound is poor. I saw his live performance with Jerry Lee Lewis in the early 60's in Muscle Shoals, AL and he was good."
1,Go to sleep with this,A good movie to watch while you are sleeping. It will not disturb you sleep or wake you up! And I love Charlie Rich ...
3,A little to fast.,"As an avid reader I was looking for a book series that resembles the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series. I bought the beginning of the Wallander series because that is what amazon recommended. I do not believe that this series is anything near the GWDT series. However, I still enjoyed this book just the same. The book keeps you interested and reveals details that make you suspect different people at all times. I liked this book enough to read books 2 and 3 and I just bought book 4. My only problem with this series so far is that the pace is much TOO fast. In one sentence it states that Wallander ate a hotdog. The very next sentence will state he ate it so fast taht he had diahrehea and was on the toilet for an hour. The book just seems to skips hours of time within paragraphs.Overall the series is good but if your like me and are looking for a title like TGWTDT then try reading In the woods or the likeness by author French."
2,Plodding with paper-thin characters,"I so wanted to love this book, and I was looking forward to reading a new series starring a recurring cast of detectives. Unfortunately, this one fell extremely flat. From the first few chapters, I searched for a reason to care why the Lovgrens had been so brutally murdered.I still don't.An arc involving Mr. Lovgren's dirty secret failed to rouse any interest, as did the misguided decision to involve a racially motivated murder in a refugee camp. I don't care about Wallander, or his wife, or his daughter, or why none of the women in his life appear to care much about him.I can't form a mental image of any character in this entire book.The slow pacing, anti-climatic ending and forgettable characters make this a book I had to force myself to finish, if only because I'll be selling it back to the local used bookstore and won't ever have another chance.I needn't have bothered."
2,Poorly translated,One of the problems with foreign language books translated into English is the poor way in which they are translated. I'm sure this book in its original form is very good but the translator has turned it into a lifeless monologue. This is the 2nd translation I've read this year (the other was an Allende book) and I've vowed never to read a translated book again (unless it comes strongly recommended by a friend.)
5,The First Wallander !,"As you may have deduced by the exclamation point above, I am a fan of Henning Mankell's Kurt Wallander series. Lisbeth Salander may be getting the press and the sales, but in my opinion, Kurt Wallander is the Detective King of Sweden. If you enjoy American and English detective novels, you may notice that the Swedish approach to crime fiction tends to be a little different. Whereas American detectives are (incorrectly) portrayed as ""loners who play be their own rules"", the Swedish detective novel tends to include more police procedure and attention to the teamwork that goes into a case. Also, rather than having a glamorous personal life, Wallander is a sympathetic character who is all the more human due to his myriad problems. If you liked Lisbeth and want to read more of what Swedish detective fiction has to offer, Henning Mankell's first Kurt Wallander novel is an ideal place to start."
1,A waste of time,"I just finished this book. Not because I enjoyed it, but because I felt that I should give it a chance to impress me. But in all of the 200+ pages, not once was my faith or effort rewarded. I threw the paperback across the room and cursed Mankell upon finishing ""Faceless Killers"".Mankell took a storyline that he could have easily made pop and succeeded in burying any interesting points or qualities under snowbanks of drudgery and poor, unimaginative writing. Mankell slings Swedish surnames rather than concentrating on character development or exploring the emotions of the protagonist. Wallander was just a cold and dreary as the described Swedish countryside.I feel that Mankell took the easy way out while ending this book, as if he didn't have the chops to bring the so-called action to an even satisfactory closing.There are far better crime novels in circulation -- use your time wisely and read elsewhere."
5,Great read,Fans of Dragon Tatoo and other mysteries will enjoy reading the Mankell Wallander series. Great characters and twisting plots make for great reading.
3,First novel,"Somewhat disappointing, compared with the works that followed. The brooding, mysterious, somber Scandinavian atmosphere is compelling and make one wish to know the conclusion. Characters not as fully developed as we expect from Wallander now."
2,Kodak Easyshare,"The camera charging part of the easy share works well, cant get the other part to function."
3,Good Information,I was pleased with the information and diet suggestions. Mediterraneans have the right idea on how to eat. The use of olive oil and combinations with tomatoes are working.
4,Not bad... need to enjoy cooking,"The premise is the same as the rest of the diets out there... watch how you eat. There are some great recipes in this book, but I found more recipes on their website."
2,Complicated menus,"The Sonoma Diet sounds good, but the recipies are difficult to follow, expensive, and hard to prepare. It doesn't allow for much flexability either."
5,Easy and delicious,"First of all, this book arrived in no time. I was very pleased with the speed of the transaction. Secondly, this book has become my Bible! It is a great diet. We are losing significant pounds, and enjoying really flavorful meals. The diet is easy to adhere to, simple to learn and to follow, and is a foodie's delight."
3,Sonoma Diet,"This book was highly recommended to me as a great way to change eating habits and achieve better health. I like the basic ideas in the book, and it is easy to follow the recommendations. The fact that fruit has to be given up for the first 10 days did put a damper on my enthusiasm. I think that any diet that limits a good food group is not realistic."
3,?,This eating plan is just plain too expensive for anyone on a fixed income as I am. It sounds very good but you have to be well off to do it.
1,Not good,"Lets see, I ordered this item on January 31st for a valentine gift and as of March 3rd, still have not received it."
2,Not for children,"Not for children""[The Dog's] paws had been hacked off at the first joint. Someone had cut its feet off while it was alive and left it to crawl away and bleed to death slowly, alone."" Page 14. These words would disturb a child or an animal lover. The writer didn't need to go that far.""Who would do that?"" ""Saxon raiders ... or Irish slavers, or Picts"" page 14. Is the author trying to stir old hatreds between peoples?""He killed him unarmed, in our marriage bed. And he had me in his blood."" Page 24. I would not want to explain this to a child or even a teenager.""Even as I drew the blade across his throat, all I thought of was, enough."" Page 39. Murder is treated as justifiable and no big deal, no remorse.Then follow many stories of siblings mistreating each other: reality, but not good example.That said, for adults it is an enjoyable book to read."
2,Big Letdown,"I stumbled on this live cd from Copeland. I had never seen it for sale anywhere before. I am a big fan of their sound and find their cd's some of the few that can be played from beginning to end with no offensive filler tracks. I'll put it plainly: this cd is not good. The band sounds great, but lead singer Aaron seems to have a real difficult time holding the notes and keeping the pitch and tune correctly. This was surprising because their studio work is tight and he hits a lot of the high notes most singers can't come close to. He seems to drone through the songs, and when he plays with the lyrics he gives his voice the effect of singing through a fan. I'm a completist and buy all available music by artists I like. If I had known this cd sounded like this I would have skipped it."
3,Great for the price...,"There was a small scratch on it, but the song I bought the CD for worked fine! And for 69 cents I can't complain!"
5,"not kidding about the ""spicy"" part!","This makes a very good soup, but be warned that it's extremely spicy! After following the package directions, I found I had to dilute the soup with some additional water and vegetables to bring the heat level down a little bit. Shrimp, veggies, a squeeze of lime juice and some fresh cilantro.... yum!"
1,Unreadable,"The six-page introduction should have tipped me off. I shouldn't need instructions on how to read a book.The ""For Dummies"" series was supposed be titled ""FROM Dummies,"" but they got it wrong because they're dumb. This book reads like a pile of pos-it notes bound together, and I think it was written by a teenage girl who dots her I's with hearts. It's just a bunch of corny jokes and cartoons (yes! really! cartoons!).I got three paragraphs into chapter one (of 21!) and emailed the book store asking about their return policy. I've learned more from cereal boxes than I will ever learn from this thing."
3,LOTSA ideas,"Sometimes we just need lotsa ideas until the right one jumps out.This is just pack full. Something will help with your reluctant child.PS. As a mother of four with only a reluctant first born....observing""his friend use the potty"" was all it took to convince him that hecould also preform on the potty."
1,Living for David,"I get it now. I could not have imagined what all the huff was about with Mr. Hasahoff. But I see now, my eyes have been opened. Mr. Hasnohoff has been sent to unearth the deep existential core in each of us. He reaches down into that part of yourself that was never supposed to be seen and he exposes it to the Universe and you are forever altered. I fear my ego structure should crumble if I tried to figure out the mystery of how the Hoff touches each one of us and teaches us things about ourselves that we might never have known with the magic of his voice and his special lyrics. David wills our spirits to bloom and soar across the rainbows. We don't have to flap our arms to fly. He'll do the flapping for us. Buy this album and you too will discover that life is indeed worth living.Thank you David. Thank you."
2,God knows what a soul needs,"As I was hitch hiking my way along highway 10, a black Comaro whizzed by and out the window came the ""best of..."" CD. I fetched it up and placed it into my walkman CD player, (man's greatest invention!). Listening to the lyrical tunes caused me to shed my urine-stained pants and make love to a wood fence post. HOT! If you want to make it with whatever is close, buy the CD; you just might do those things you have always wanted to do but were too shy. Love, peace, and tweezers (for the splinters)."
2,You get what you pay for,"Cooked bacon-wrapped scallops on the outdoor grill to break this thing in (after an initial hand washing, of course). Sprayed it liberally with olive oil cooking spray, then put the scallops on and sprinkled on some spice and more olive oil. It did a great job. Rinsed and wiped it briefly and then put it in the dishwasher. It came out with a couple of areas where the non-stick coating is already pitting after just the one use. I don't expect this to be around for very long."
5,really really good,"i am not one for reading, i really need to be motivated but i was recommended this book and i have to say that this is one of the best stories i have ever read. it may only be 60 odd pages long but it feels so much more than that and it will send you through i whole host of emotions. really really read the book before you see the film. as i live in the uk the film isn't out here yet but i am curious to see if the film can do the book justice. i really hope so. if you don't read anything else this year read this."
3,Ho-Hum....decent writing about gay cowboys,"I dunno, the two dudes just ""do it"" for some reason because they are forced together. It just happens...and it keeps happening over the years.The plot felt rushed and I never could accept the premise. I understand the story is trying to make a larger statement, but without justifying the central action, or at least providing a context that isn't so incongruous I couldn't latch on.Good writing? Absolutely! Did I feel for them at the end? Absolutely!I am as open-minded as the next straight guy, but author just did not do enough to set up the initial conflagration."
1,A Surprising Dull Story,"Brokeback Mountain, the novella, is a surprisingly dull read. Sheepherders Jack Twist and Ennis del Mar get together in a 20-year-long sexual relationship. The reader never gets the idea that these men love each other or even care for each other until one struggles with the death of the other lover. With each page, I struggled with reasoning. What is it that draws these two men together season after season, year after year for 20-years? What do they have in common? What special unbreakable bond was formed in the summer of 1963 to keep them drawn to each other?The story is flat, and the characters are without motivation. Jack and Ennis could have been fleshed out a little more while still keeping the story as concise as it was."
5,The best short story I've never read,"After saw the movie I was really interested into read the paperback, it is a love story that is really emotive that gives you the oportunity to understand that it is no matter what gender are you and the person you love."
2,Disappointed,I needed more story to understand all the issues. The book was too short and I was left with questions.
4,Sparse and poignant,"Childhood by Andre Alexis McClelland & Stewart Inc. 1998The story follows the life of Thomas MacMillan from early childhood until the death of his mother, Katerina, and Henry Wing, one of his mother's lovers. The main characters are superbly drawn while Thomas remains for us only a wispy image generated by his thoughts.The love of Henry for Katerina is constant, undemanding and rises above the everyday demands of mere mortals. Katerina, on the other hand moves by her own light and one is never sure if she is capable of loving and one wonders too what has caused this strange disconnectedness.There are wryly funny sections and clear bright narrative bits that draw the reader in. At the end one realizes that the story is touchingly sentimental while being questioningly honest. I liked the book but had a strange unsatisfied feeling when I was finished. I wanted to know more of Henry, Katerina and Thomas."
5,"Amazing Paradigm Change, so simple I had missed it","At last, I have discovered the answer to so many of my struggles in Ed Kurath's book. After years of treading a path to the self help section of my local book store (with no significant change in my life), I was recommended ""I will Give you Rest."" This book has made an enormous impact in my ability to understand my past, see why I kept experiencing reoccurring wounds and learn why I was not able to gain inner healing and lastingchange. I thank God for the manner in which Ed communicates the principles in this book. I am amazed how I kept missing God's invitation to heal me throughout my life. I tell others' it is so simple, I missed it!Please don't miss your opportunity for the most amazing transformation and paradigm change you will ever experience. My relationship with God, my family, friends and myself have been significantly enhanced. My life is transforming in the most blessed way. Thank you so very much, Ed!! Nancy, Centreville, VA"
4,Interesting corner of NYC history,"If you are interested in the Circle Line, Statue of Liberty line, or other non-commuter ferries and excursion boats, this book is a good reference for you. Well researched and footnoted."
5,nice quick reference guide,I started in oil paints a couple years ago and found this book a great help. There are so many different color paints on the market this helped narrow down to the essentials. The mixes recommended for skin tones has been a nice springboard to jump from. Definately worth the money.
1,Waste of money,I did not realize just how bad this band's music was. Other than their hit song the music was terrible.
4,Generative programming,"Out of the three programming books (the other two are: ""Modern C++ design"" by Alexandrescu and ""C++ templates"" by Vandevoorde and Josuttis) that I have read about C++ template or generic programming, this is the best one.I have not just glided through the book but have actually taken the time following the book to implement some experiments of my own.The other two books are excellent books on this topic but this is the only one that offers the philosophy and big picture of what generic (actually this volume is about generative, which the authors claim to be more than just generic) programming is all about.It is a fun read, especially after one has some generic programming experience."
5,Another great book from Sandra Brown,"This is one of my favorite Sandra Brown books. It is a very fast read-I read it in less than one day. Keely is a woman whose husband has been MIA for 12 years. On the way to a PROOF convention, she meets Congressman Dax. This has a very interesting, real plot that keeps your attention from the first chapter. Definitely a great summer read!!"
3,Excellent Service,I love this product but the spray function has always been challenging; however the supplier was outstanding & handled a problem in such a manner that I would definitely order from them in the future.
5,Diamomd In The Rough,"Like the title of one of her songs... Alicia Bridges is truely a 'diamond in the rough!'I still cannot believe that this lady was so underrecognized as an artist. She must be surely something when she is performing live. I of course - love her staple song 'I Love The Night Life,' but also like her No.86 hit 'Body Heat,' as well as other greats such as the country-tinged 'City Rhythm,' the funk-like 'In The Name of Love,' and the original footlose dancer 'Learned To Dance Too Soon.' Bottom line... I like 13 out of 16 songs on this CD; all but 'We Are One,' 'High Altitudes,' and 'So Cozy.'For those of you who are curious... Alicia started doing DJ/VJ work in the 1980's after her music career stayed at a hault, and lived in San Francisco for a while. Then she moved back to Atlanta, and in the mid-90's started working at a gay club called The Otherside Lounge. I believe she still works there, too. [...]"
1,Problem after problem,"I bought this machine about two years ago had previously had the Saeco Vienna plus,my mistake was wanting a change and I thought buying a more expensive machine I would get a far superior espresso. Within about a month I kept getting a ""ventilate"" message which stops the whole action of the machine. Do not but this machine it reoccurs on a constant basis,its not worth the money at all."
1,Gaggia Titanium SS was awful!,"Purchased and received machine from WholeLatteLove. First espresso was made perfectly. Trouble began when we attempted to use steam/hot water. Machine immediately said ""close knob"". We closed the knob and the machine said ""ventilate"". We read the instructions and manually primed the water pump with the cheap, plastic, ill-fitted primer they sent with the machine. This worked. The real problem arose when the machine asked us to ""ventilate"" every time we initiated the steam/hot water. We had to manually prime the pump over and over and over again. The company took the defective machine back but asked us WHY we did not want another one to replace it. Go figure. Would not recommend this machine to anyone."
3,could be better; didn't answer many of my questions,I thought that this book could have been better. Some of my questions were unanswered. The book is almost too simple and I felt that it lacked some meat.
3,"Very basic, some interesting points.","I decided to give this book as a gift, as it is a good introduction and starting point when in a quandary as to where to begin in the process. This was the first book I read on home decorating and it did give me some things to consider that I might not have thought of with the massive project of decorating, coordinating color schemes, lighting, etc. I went on to more in-depth books, which this wasn't one of them."
5,childhood favorite,i grew up playing spyro. it is probably my favorite game ever. i have all the sypro games and i still love to play them.
5,Have you seen how geese and ducks are raised?,They range freely. They come running when it is time for the gavage. I would not call this torture. Now if you want to talk about torture look at the factory farming of chickens here in th US.
3,Glad I read it though I wanted more,"I agree with those who have said there are good things in this book, but it lacks a true picture of what life is like in her family and enough specific suggestions for making it work. I love her emphasis on making sure mom is getting needs met. It is a message I need to hear and getting permission from a mom of 10(!) to do this is very helpful...if she can find the time to look good, take good care of herself, then I ought to be able as well.I would have loved more specific examples and techniques for helping children be responsible, disciplining them, managing the chaos that ensues, etc... She's got to have a wealth of ideas for making that work. She's got to have tackled many difficult issues, but you can't see that in this book.All in all, I'm glad I read the book. I got value from it. But I'd love to see her write something more geared to raising kids with a lot of specifics."
2,"Like her, like what she stands for, disapointed by the book....","I truly like her, I love the premise of this book, the principles, but I put this book down feeling a void. I don't know anything about her, the book barely grazed the surface, Kathryn was not vulnerable at an point. Ultimately I blame that on a poor editor, for not pushing for more, for not directing her in a way that really pulls the readers in. I could have gotten the information in this book from any mom."
1,Ridiculous,"Why should this woman think that having 10 kids is so praiseworthy? And from looking through the book, it is obvious that she is leaving out all the parts about the household help she obviously has. I have three kids and don't have enough time to drive them all the places they need to go. Somehow Ms. Sansone leaves out any logistical details about how she and her staff might manage that for her large family. Her other ""insights"" are regurgitated from any number of other sources, where they were presented better and more originally."
3,Have not installed this yet,"However, this is a well built product. I live in a rental, so I will not install this unless weather justifies it."
5,Oh my Gosh!!!,"Not a big fan of condoms but realizing their importance I decided to try these. WOW!!! Almost like nothing at all, no yucky latex smell, they are very clear so you still see everything. . .had to double check to make sure it was on him. . .fits a large one quite well and comfy. Boyfriend was thrilled too! Ladies, this is the condom to carry in your purse, well worth a little extra money because as far as safe sex goes this is gonna blow his mind ;o)"
3,A simple book with heartfelt advice,Personally though I felt this book was too outdated for our modern society. I believe the advice in this book could have worked about 20 years ago. Just one question: What was the name of that perfume???
1,Too many errors,"I love to read non-fiction such as this and to learn things about the history of technology. Unfortunately, James Dyson's A History of Great Inventions is fraught with errors. What good is a book of supposed history if it all becomes suspect? If the simple facts are wrong, how do I know if the less simple ones are correct?An example: On page 155, Mr Dyson states that the Panama Canal opened in 1937. This is 23 years after the fact. Some things are arguable, such as the first machine that could be christened a computer, but some things simply aren't. Dyson's book gets too many things wrong to make it anything but a very frustrating read. I recommend avoiding this book entirely."
4,Overall a solid preparation,"Good introduction explaining format of test; thourough yet consise guidance on multiple choice/essay sections; excellent list of past open ended questions, suggested readings, useful definitions of lit terms. I found that the multiple choice selections on the practice tests were easier than those on the actual exam."
4,Tupac and Elvis: Inevitably Restless,"Tupac and Elvis is a fine book. I bought it for my teenager and he loved it. I'm not a huge fan of either, but when I read it, I was smitten and excited by it. So I give it four stars for its realism."
3,tupac and elvis: inevitably restless,I enjoyed the read although I was a bit frustrated with the vast number of spelling errors and mistakes. It made the book look like a rough draft of a college essay. An editor or spell check may come in handy for this author's next book.
1,THE WORST HEAVY METAL ALBUM EVER,Now I understand why Philip Anselmo left Pantera 4 years ago. I can't belive people spend their time to create a record like this one. It's totally waste of time.
5,Anything with Dime ROCKS!,"Dime and David Allen??!! What a pair! First hear about this album messin around on the net. ""Nothin to Lose"".... WOW!!! Those fisrt cords just blew me away! A must for all Pantera fans. Gets a little country, but after a few listens, it grows on ya. If the Pantera boys were into it....so be it. I would have given my right nut just to have a few beers and to sit in with them. Dime forever!!! S.D.M.F."
5,Unique but Rocks!!!,"If you are a Pantera fan then you have to get this album. This band consists of all the original Pantera members except for the lead singer. The idea of this band was to combine metal and country music. But rest assured, with Dimebag on guitar, this album rocks hard."
1,way too much dairy,"It seems as though the dairy organization has subsidized this book. Cannot understand why all this dairy in the recipes. It is just a vile book! I am very upset about having spend my hard earned money, on this !=@#%^&?"
4,"Review of Millwrights and N=Mechanics Guide, 4th edition","I found this guide to be full of information not found anywhere else. The topic selection is very broad; ranging from drawings and sketches, to welding and blacksmithing. His style of writing, being geared to the layman, is clear and very understandable. All technical terms are explained thouroughly, and the drawings and photos are good. My weakness is electical, but after reading chapter #22 ""Elecricity"", I learned more than I have anywhere else. I have found this book to be complete, concise, and full of information I can use in my everyday work. I would recommend this book to homeowners, as well as engineers. My copy will stay in my toolbox at work for reference on many different projects, and I will be ordering another one for my wifes book collection. She is very happy to find such diverse information in one book."
3,So-so,"A group of intelligent young women meets at Radcliffe College in 1943 and immediately bonds, because of the proximity of their dormitory rooms. As a group, they are almost a cliche, one rich and beautiful, one overweight and very plain, another, dark, intense and Jewish, yet another, dark, intense and Catholic and the last of them, not quite beautiful, not quite stylish but with an as yet unkindled, but very strong, sexual drive. The story continues through their study years, marriages, love affairs and business successes. Of course, there is lots of drama and breast beating as the story progresses through several wars, straying husbands and recalcitrant children, but it's all a bit too much like a soapie for me to really enjoy...an ok read !"
3,New footage inbetween classic toons,"This is pretty much a tape of all the space related cartoons WB made - Marvin and Bugs, and Duck Dodgers 'toons. There is new footage tying the very flimsy plot together, of Bugs being prosecuted for stopping Marvin so many times. However it was made after Mel Blanc's passing, and the voices are not the same, so there is a bit of a jarring effect when this moves from the classic toons to the new bits. I wish they hadn't chopped up the old toons in order to go along with the terribly bad plot, but all in all it's not a bad tape. However some of the compilation tapes are better as they show the full cartoon.Novelty/collecter/fan wise - seeing the new footage is worth the fee."
5,MUST HAVE for AEV uscm reference material.,"I'm pretty sure the other reviews are excellent in the description of this books content. For myself I've always wanted to pick this up but usually you could never find it below $70. I was fortunate enough to get a AEV colonial marine kit sometime ago and looking for any reference material on the various uscm equipment was kinda a pain. This book truly provides all the reference material I needed to complete and detail the kit. Now I have a OUTSTANDING colonial marine for my display case!I haven't read it yet (I've read some small parts) but the book is chock full of great uscm insights, and story. I'm looking forward to reading it from front to back!"
3,Searching her soul,"This seems to be the first Vonda Shepard album (I'm not sure, but the name itself says it - I mean, who would call his second or third or any other album by his/her name?)And it is very different from her later work. Here she is still searching for her kind of sound, she is experimenting - and it's a good thing.The not-so-bad thing is, basically, the same - she hasn't found her music yet, like she would in her later work. There is too much electronic sound, which I wasn't prepaired for.If you really like her songs, you will find this album interesting, because it shows how she evolved in the years that followed.I liked the album in general, but the texts here are mostly better than music (as a writer she was then as good as now)."
2,Did not perform as advertised,Will not pick-up small clumps of cat hair from my rugs. Have to repeatedly go over most debris on my rugs before the sweeper will pick it up.
2,Not impressed,I was not impressed with this item. I doesn't do well on tile at all. It's alright for carpet but still takes more then one sweep over it. I didn't want something with batteries or a charger so I bought a hoky. Way to hiped up and overpriced.
5,A GLASSFUL OF LETTERS,"Best novel I read since Charming Billy. Had trouble putting it down, it gripped me immediately and does s fine job of increasing conflict up to the very last chapter. Story told with letters and an occasional chapter devoted to a single character providing his/her background from childhood on. Well written, characters developed in full. Read the book from our library - it was published in Ireland - and purchased a copy to send to a daughter who will loan it to others. Wonderful story - or stories really."
3,Kick Stand Needs Improvement,"Provides good protection for the iPod, but I bought it for the Kick Stand feature to watch movies while flying. The Kick Stand slides up from the top and then folds down where the arms lock in place in the middle via slightly raised plastic bumps on each side. The problem is that the arms are too thin and need more pressure to keep locked in place. Given the weight of the 5.5 iPod (mine is 80G), it doesn't take much pressure against the iPod to make the Kick Stand fail and collapse. I had to use a rubber band to help give the legs more pressure to stay locked in place."
1,will scratch the hell out of your 80gb ipod,"This case was responsible for unsightly scratches on the back and sides of my ipod. It also caused scratching on the click wheel. The only reason the face wasn't scratched so bad was because I put a protective film over the face of my ipod before using this case. Don't buy this crap if you ever want to sell your ipod, or just want to keep it in mint condition because it cost you 350."
1,Not So Good.,Plastic casing would not snap closed for my 80G - straight from the box...don't waste your money! The whole thing felt like it was going to crack into pieces if I tried to force it any more closed. At least this product on Amazon is almost half the price of what I paid at a very popular retailer.
4,swirling dervish of a tune,"Having lived in Japan for decades, let's face facts, much of even ""indies"" J-rock/pop is rock without the roll. Chara manages to create a sound of swirling pop sounds without veering to far into sugary treacle territory. Certainly this would be a standout track on any modern pop record with a smidgen of cred. Too bad this never reached a larger Western audience."
3,Mostly Good,I would say that this album was still pretty tight even though I already heard most of the songs on mixtapes. I am still down with him since he reps south fla. I just am a little mad that I didn't hear anything new waiting all this time to get my hands on this one. I am in Kuwait and had to wait longer then most people to get this and the longer wait made me want it more. His mix tapes are better.
1,Trick Daddy reps Miami better than Pitbull,"Lil jon, ok, you've tried to succeed with a new artist by the name of Pitbull. This guy's music is wack with a capital W. I've heard better rappers come out the 305 than Pitbull."
2,Gov. Benefits,Before purchase I thought it said the copyrite date was 1998. Turned out to be 1992. This purchase was for a friend. He had this book copyrited 1996.
2,No lasting appeal,The only thing that will keep your interest is the Anime series. Fun for the first couple times. Then it just gets frustrating. This game has no real lasting appeal.
2,What a disappointment,"Purchased to replace Visioneer 8700. Turns out that many of the things I liked about the 8700 are not on the 9420. On the 8700 you could press the SCAN button on the scanner and have images stack into Paperport. This was done in Visioneers .MAX format. The 9420 does not scan in the Visioneer .MAX format and scanned documents cannot be stacked without going through a much longer procedure each time.Also, scanning is much slower with the 9420. Took over 50 seconds to scan 2 Black & White pages at 200 DPI.I also miss having a FAX button on scanner."
4,Pretty good educational book,"My three year old daughter and I had been observing pelicans on our daily walks. I told her I'd find her a book on them so we could learn more about them. I found this one and bought it. She really enjoys it and while much of the tone of it is above the head of a three year old, she still gets a lot out of it and it will -- likely -- have longevity as she gets older and understands more about it."
2,"If you are one hoping for the end, this is a must read.","What a waste of time. To think people really believe this stuff. Ok I understand people having sex with little green men, but with devils."
2,I liked it when it worked.,"I can't remember if I ordered it on here or from Sears, but I got it because it was on sale. Worked great for awhile, then it started to lose power. I took it apart and the 3 bolts on the rotor housing loosened up and the gasket blew out so none of the air was making it to the rotor etc. replaced the gasket and the other 2 gaskets and it worked great again for awhile. Then it just stop working altogether, took it apart again, found the bolt loose again, the gasket was blown out again and the rotor shaft was partially bent/breaking so it binded up and wouldnt' turn, bought a new rotor for it, installed it, but it still binds and wont' turn once i tighten up the bolts. For the amount of money that I spent on it I am just not impressed. I have had many other air tools that I use daily that have lasted longer then this considering I don't often use the 3/4. I will never buy another SK air tool again. I will stick with Chicago Pneumatic."
1,WOW,"This movie is terrible. Even if you liked Escanaba, this movie is a no go. I can't think of a single reason to buy, rent or even watch this one. Go clean the windows in your mother in laws house. Anything. Maybe you should just go ice fishing for real."
2,Outdated info,Subject matter outdated and little to do with what's current state of VDP XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXX XXX
5,Awesome Juicer!,"I've had this for nearly three months now and am extremely happy with this juicer. I regularly juice kale, spinach, celery, cucumbers, cabbage, carrots, apples, pears, blood oranges and ginger. The juice output seems fine to me and the pulp is always dry enough that I feel I am getting max liquid extraction. I agree with other reviews that the level 5 speed is really not necessary, I do most of my juicing at 2 or 3, only occasionally at 4.Cleanup is a breeze if done right away, usually just rinsing is required (with a faucet sprayer); I run through dishwasher maybe once a week. The included scrub brush does a great job cleaning the basket, maybe 30 seconds of good scrubbing gets out all the tougher green bits. And the finish is just beautiful, like other Breville appliances, and I am happy to leave it out on the counter. It's made juicing far easier than I had ever imagined and I am very happy with my investment every day."
5,Good Job!,"Just received my juicer. Picked some fresh veges from the garden and had the best, freshest drink ever.It was a little overwhelming opening the box and seeing something larger than my normal blender. But after reading the directions, a quick rinse and loading of my garden veges and a little coconut water, I was a fan.Very powerful and really does the job. No pulp, just pure wonderful juice. As easy to clean as possible considering the job it has to do.I looked at many other juice extractors for months and finally decided to go with the Breville. Happy I did."
5,Worth for the price!,"This is our first time buying a juicer, and Breville sure does its job well! We are very impressed with its performance. Best features we liked were :it's easy to clean, it's built-in forth extractor,simple assembly, and mostly the different speed levels for different kinds of soft and hard fruits which makes juicing more efficient."
1,Believe the Reviews - Died 2nd day using machine,"I was hesitant to buy this product, but so many gave it a good review, there were a few that had the issue of machine not working. I was one of them. For a brand that is considered leading in juicing, this product is terrible. It did produce more juice than my previous machine, but the motor seemed to die on the second day using it, I'm very disappointed in the quality control of this product."
3,so-so,"I regret that I bought a centrifugal juicer to begin with, but there are some benefits to this juicer. It is easy to assemble and cleans up relatively well, though there is a film on some of the plastic parts that just don't look clean no matter what I do. I don't believe it's as amazing as the majority of reviewers here, except for in the case of hard veggies like carrots, celery and apples. It works great for those. If you want to juice anything else, like greens... which is at least half of what I juice, look elsewhere. The pulp in general is not that dry, and every time I put greens in and half of it flies out to the disposal bin (at any speed) without even being juiced I regret having wasted that money on the produce and the machine itself."
4,Like my Juicer.... but,"I have been using my juicer for over 3 months now and really like the fact that I rarely have to cut my fruits in order for them to fit. I use it at least 2 times per week, and I am very happy that I am adding to a healthy lifestyle. The one problem I have been experiencing is getting thin slices of both carrots and apples along with the pulp. I must admit though that the pulp is dry. I have called Breville and they told me to ensure that I am making the correct speed selection for the correct fruit/vegetables. For example, I use speed 5 for the carrots and apples, but I still see some thin slices. I again tried speed 4 and saw the same problem. It's not a lot, but enough to cause some concern. Afterall, fruits and vegetables can be costly, and this can be translated into wasting my money and the produce. I welcome any suggestion if someone had this problem and was able to resolve it."
1,Leaky and very wet pulp,I've only used my new Breville juicer twice. Both times it leaked all over my kitchen counter and the pulp was filled with liquid. Since there were such good ratings on this product... I thought this would be a winner. I was wrong. I emailed the company and they said I should buy a new filter or clean it. After many years of owning juicers... I was shocked at this reply. So.... This defective juicer is being returned... thank goodness I ordered it from Amazon. The Breville company didn't help at all.
4,Happy with this juicer,"I am very happy with this juicer. It is a lot stronger than the Acme juicer I was using before and the Breville is SO much easier to clean. I only gave it 4 stars because I find it is too fast to be very effective at juicing the smaller, leafy greens like spinach or cilantro. Kale seems to work because it is larger and tougher. Even on the slowest speed it mostly blows the spinach leaves into the pulp bin without masticating them. I can make it work if I put the spinach through along with a cucumber, which is soft enough to juice at the slower speed, but I don't always have cucumbers on hand."
3,It's ok,"I thought I would be wowed by the Breville since someone reccommended it to me and the reviews seemed pretty good over all. I already had a regular juicer by Krups, nothing fancy, but I lost the plunger. So I got this one and I can see exactly what some of the reviews said. If you put things like grapes in, it spits out of the whole before ou can get the plunger in, if you use the cup spout you can only fill half the glass because the wind blows the juice out all over the place. Also, I find a few slices of apple left after I juice. I do like the speed of it, different settings, and the juice pitcher. But I never had any of the messy problems with my cute little Krups juicer. If I find the plunger online for the Krups I may return the Breville.... Still deciding."
4,Sturdy,"Honestly luv this thing just wish it was able to handle juicing semi-frozen fruit, and handled softer fruit a little better. But all in all i love this thing and so glad i purchased."
5,"The best Juicer I've ever owned, hands down!","This juicer is powerful, efficient (the pulp comes out almost like sawdust), quiet, solidly built, a cinch to clean, and sexy! What's not to love? =D"
2,Less than pleased...,"I have a Jack Lalanne Power Juicer and love it... we needed another one to have when my husband travels so that we can both still juice while he's away. I like the looks of this Breville Juicer, but it is no match for the JL we currently have. The pulp in the JL is DRY where as the Breville leaves chunks of apples and WET fibers in the dump container when finished. I just do not feel this juicer is worth the price and we're planning on returning it for another JL or possibly an Omega Vert. Sorry Breville... you just didn't meet my expectations."
4,Good for beginner juicers,"THis is an awesome device..a) Good for beginner juicersb) Good for hard/soft fruits and vegetablesc) Not good for greens or wheat grass. but thats expected with the $200 juicer)Reason why people considering the cheaper juicers should by this (even brevilles $99 compact juicer)- Quicker Juicing and even quicker cleanup- the amount of juice extracted is more.- powerful motor and takes in large carrots apples- its tries with the leafy greens like Kale and spinach, manages to extract some of the goodness, but lot of it is in the bin. Heard its better than most of the others.Now technically i am not sure how much of the nutrients are lost during the extraction of juice by this method, but again beginners are going to love this.Only peeve and the reason for 4 stars is that there is a sharp protrusion in the chute which does cut your fingers if your not too careful while cleaning."
5,My first... and last juicer,"I bought this as my first juicer after reading mostly excellent reviews here and have been very pleased with the results.Now, I have not blended too many juices together; I have mostly juiced various fruits. It makes the best orange juice I have ever had. The apple juice is very good as well, though I would recommend peeling the apples first, as it will leave the apple juice a bit pulpy. Strawberries and peaches also come out excellent. I have juiced both of those and then blended the juice with ice cream and made excellent smoothies. Grapefruit juice is also tasty.I recommend the juicer, as nearly everything comes out decently smooth, and the motor is very powerful. All in all, a very good machine."
3,not great,"I used my $100 Jack LaLanne juicer for 5+ years and never had an issue. But decided I wanted to upgrade to a ""better"" machine. After carefully reading tons of reviews I decided on this juicer - it was between this and the Breville Juice Fountain Plus - and I figured the extra $50 for the multiple speeds would be well worth it. Well I am not so pleased. The multiple speeds are completely worthless. Whole chucks of greens, beets, carrots, and everything else I juice come through no matter what speed I use and what order I juice the produce in. The pulp is also a little more wet than it should be. I can say that my LaLanne definitely had a small amount of pieces in the pulp, but no where near as much as this Breville does - and the pulp in the LaLanne is definitely drier.The nice parts are the noise, it's considerably quitter. And there's much less splatter in both the juice cup and the pulp basket - two fairly decent pluses. Still not sure it's worth $100 more than the LaLanne though."
1,Faulty Product - Do Not Buy,"My wife and I purchased 2 of these items within the same week and both were broken out of the box. Upon plugging the item in it displayed an E and the motor never engaged. I went to the website to see what was wrong and found out that it is a know issue. The company asks that you file a warranty claim, and not return the item to the store. We tried to do so, then the company refused to replace the unit. This is my first time purchasing this brand and boy did we have a poor customer experience. I would not recommend that you purchase a product from a company that knowingly refuses to honor its own warranty for a defective product. We will be buying any products from this company in the future."
3,Like it but there are some issues,"The Breville BJE510XL Juicer works pretty well. It gets the job done quickly which was what I was looking for in a juicer.Here are the issues I have with the Juicer:1) When juicing citrus, there is a tendancy for pulp to make it into the juice.2) When ejecting the pulp into the bin, the pulp will stick to the top and eventually block the chute and force the pulp into the juice.3) The pulp is not very dry and very wet if you try to juice citrus.4) Cleanup is quick for most pieces except for the micromesh filter. It takes lots of scrubbing to get all the build up out of the filter.5) It creates ALOT of foam when juicing. This is expected from a centrifugal juicer but there is quite a bit of foam created.For the price, I do like this juicer and have recommended it to others."
4,Love my new juicer,"This juicer does a great job. The only complaint I have is that the manual says, ""with the motor running, place food into the feed chute and use the food pusher to gently guide food down."" I wind up putting the food in first and then turning the motor on, otherwise the food shoots out onto the counter even when putting the food in and quickly covering it with the food pusher. Easy to use and easy clean up."
1,Stopped working after 3 months :-(,"I bought this in June 2012. Today, 3 months later, while juicing some melon, the motor stopped spinning. I turned the power off and on again but, the screen lit up without any speed number and the motor won't spin.I suspect that the melon which has a tougher out ""layer"" (not the peel/skin) killed the motor at the soft fruit speed. I wish the manual had said, only very soft fruits instead of saying to juice melons at speed 1. So be careful, if you juice melons and it has a tougher outer edge, set the speed to at least 3. Never ever use speed 1."
3,Failed after 2.5 months.,"The juicer is excellent when it's functional. It's somewhat quiet and extremely powerful. During the last attempted run, it suddenly failed. The LCD panel lit but did not display digits or any other information.I called customer service on the day the product failed. The agent was very professional, and so was the response: a brand new replacement."
3,"First juicer DOA, replacement is almost as bad.","My first juicer was dead on arrival, Amazon handled it very well and next day'd me a new one. I assembled it, turned it on and nothing happened. Just as I was about to let out a huge sigh it started running. I turned it on and off over and over again to see if it would keep working. Each time it took between 3 seconds and a minute before it would turn on. It just has a mind of its own. With all of these 5 star reviews I was sure I was going to get a great product but it seems Breville has some major issues going on lately. I decided to go ahead and use it because I've been wanting to start juicing for quite awhile now, if it does quit working I will probably go with a refund and look for a different juicer."
5,easy!,I have not spent the money on a juicer before because of the tales I've heard about spending more time cleaning them than it's worth. A friend invited me over to see how easy his Breville juicer was to clean - (5 minutes) and I immediately ordered mine. Since receiving it I've juiced one meal a day and LOVE how I feel. This juicer is worth every penny for the ease of operation and cleaning - and I've lost a few pounds as well from drinking wonderfully tasting dense combination of fruits and vegetables!
5,Juicer friendly,"This is an excellent juicer, does a fantastic job of juicing and very very easy to clean if you do it immediately after you are done juicing. My only disappointment was, that my 1st Breville that I ordered was broke when I opened the box, but Amazon was amazing and sent me a new one out the next day and made arrangement to have the broken one picked up. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in juicing. Was disappointed when a few days after I received my juicer they lowered the price by $40.00 and was told I could return the one I had and re-order at the new price."
4,Love it!,My daughter bought another Juicer and she was very happy with it...but when I read the reviews I wasn't sure...after reading numerous reviews and suggestions from other reviews...I decided on the Breville BJE510XL and I am HAPPY that I did' ...I have used it and love everything about it! I am not only happy with the juicer but also happy that I can get my recommended amount of veggie & fruit daily...and it's alot cheaper than buying bottled juice from the store where you have to guess what other things are in it... very glad I made the purchase and spent a tad bit more for it...
1,"Christians, Be Careful",No one can deny that this young lady is a very appealing and gifted artist. My comments are aimed at committed Christians.Akiane's portrait of Christ is very moving to me. Yet her depictions of angels....did I detect a little New Age here? So I checked out her website and urge you to do the same before you decide to purchase this book. Her art and message are reflecting New Age dogmas.
3,Disappointed,"Upon the book's arrival I was ready to spend hours of anticipated delight. Not so! The detail described on the paintings is not addressed at all. Unfortunately, the webpage has a better layout and offers a magnifying tool for the true appreciation to these beautiful paintings. Akiane is a blessed and one-of-a-kind child."
5,Excellent Book,"My daughter called me and told me to check out Akiane's website. I spent hours looking at her art and reading her poetry. I saw her on Oprah but hadn't kept up with her. I saw on the website that she had put her art and poetry in a book, so I had to have it. It was an excellent gift to myself. For anyone who wants to be uplifted or just marvel at otherworldly talent, this is your book:)"
5,Love this book!,"Fantastic book! Quick, interesting read! Akiane is amazing...truly believe she is one of God's special ones! Wish she would come out with another book that includes all of her recent paintings and stories."
5,Amazing,"I loved this book, so inspirational, what a gift from GOD she has! I have her picture of Jesus in my bedroom"
1,Back to the drawing board,Will not retract anyway near as quick as needed. Lease constantly gets wrapped around pet orunder legs. Next time put some recoil strength in the lease.
5,Sorry I missed attending one of there concerts,I couldn't tell that this DVD was copied from a videotape. Good quality and good price. I love the high pitch singing by a man. Brings back many romantic memories during my high school days.
3,Cleanser??,"I like this product for the acne aspect (I get less break-outs now) but for cleaning make up off? Forget about it. After use, my make up comes off on my towel! What's with that?? Disheartening."
4,OW.,"This product is excellent for controlling existing acne and preventing more from cropping up, though it obviously cannot help control stress breakouts, which I unfortunately suffer from.Just a warning, however: DO NOT GET THIS IN YOUR EYES. Worst thing that has ever come in contact with my eyes.. it felt like pure acid on my retina. It took me 20 minutes to fully wash off my eye and then an hour to recuperate from the pain/experience.You'd think Neutrogena would put it's warning label in bold or something.. here I was thinking it couldn't possibly hurt more than shampoo.."
1,Wow..,"This crap destroyed my skin..My face was peeling and bleeding. If you've got sensative skin, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT! Don't waste your money..."
4,Decent facewash,"A mildly refreshing face wash that leaves you feeling fresh and clean. Although it dries out the skin, it really seems to do its trick on controling the acne. The damaged skin was peeling off, to let new layer of skin to grow underneath. If it gets too dry, just put a dab of lotion on, no biggie."
1,not good for face,"i used it for the first time last night and its its 6 pm the next day and my face is still dry, tight and peeling i wouldnt recomend for face"
5,Reliance Control 30508B Pro/Tran 8-Circuit 30 Amp,I looked around at other Transfer Switches but this is the one that caught my eye. The company has been in business for 100 years so that sealed the deal. It's a very elegant and functional design. It was easy to install and am very happy with my purchase and Amazon service
4,Wonderful Experience,This was my first laser printer... for the money I am very impressed. The toner cartridges lasted over a year. I went from spending almost 200.00 a month for ink to having the toner that came with the unit lasting me for over a year. I was disappointed that the imaging drum was so expensive and that there was not an inexpensive version. Be sure to get the service agreement... I did have trouble with the fuser at first but hp was very good about fixing the problem. I highly recommend this product.
1,Break failed and dog almost got hit by a car,"The break feature failed and the leash did not retract as my puppy was crossing the street, he almost got hit by a car. I contact the company and they said they would send me a new leash immediately and it would arrive in 1 week. It had been 5 weeks and no leash. I would not recommend this leash. Go with another company."
2,Not what I was expecting,"I wish I had liked this book. It had all of the characteristics of a classic. First of all, the way she described things in this book did not invoke an image. I had to read over a hundred pages to begin to envision her writing style. I realize that she was trying to describe small town America, but there were too many characters, and not all of them developed well. I really hated the ending. It was just over.... that was it.... the way she killed off Robert was silly, and pointless at the time it happened. It was like I was reading the first draft to something that could turn out to be amazing."
4,"Your Skill is good, but Mine is Better!","This is a suppliment to the Hero System RPG. You would need to own it in order to use this book. It is packed full of examples for the Hero System gamer.It gives examples of different Martial Arts styles and how they can be used in different genres (from Super Hero to fantasy to pulp to wuxia).The book is a bit of a ""Dry"" read, but well written and is a must for any Hero Games player. Highly recommended."
4,As expected,These magnets are cool and my 7 year old loves them. Good buy. Would reccomend these magnets especially for the price of 2-3 $.
4,Qualitative Research Methods,Chapters written in a way that clearly define each qualitative research method. Lots of information however not too wordy. Overall a succint overview of qualitative reserach methods.
4,title for my review,"Excellent high quality light. Perfect for any professional that needs a reliable, lightweight flashlight.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the slight blueish color of the light, the ad said a ""white"" LED. It is not a true white light and I was a bit disappointed."
1,Not worth the price,I received the Volo as a gift. I would have never purchased this item for myself. There are so many comparable strollers for a fraction of the price. This accessory package is a joke. These items should come standard with the stroller.
1,save your money,"I bought this book because I like Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series. Don't do what I did.I couldn't finish the book. The dialogue is awkward, the characters were unlikable. If there was a plot, I couldn't find it.I felt taken advantage of by the author. The author is tricking fans into buying her older, unsuccessful books. Sometimes there is a reason books are unsuccessful: the books are awful.Go ahead and read the Stephanie Plum books. They are interesting, they are fun to read, but ignore the re-released older books Evanovich wrote. I have tried to read two of them and couldn't finish either one."
5,Great Book!,"This book was an easy read and it was Hilarious! The story line was about how opposites can attract and nothing is impossible. I liked how Janet Evanvich added Romance, Suspense, and Drama into the characters lives. It was Incredible how she made a neighborhood drug bust turn into a love affair between neighbors who have different views on life. Kate, a divorced inspiring cellist who believes in working hard and then there David Dodd the next door hunk who won the lottery and hasn't worked since. My favorite character was Elsie she was a real hoot with her shotgun that she used once or twice. She was brave, crazy, and pretty spontaneous for her age. This story was a great page-turner that always kept me on the edge of my seat especially at the end of the book. Anyone who thinks they might be interested in reading this book should it was definitely worthwhile and I would read it again in a heartbeat. I hope to see more books by Janet Evanvich about Kate and David in the future."
4,Fun Story,I have liked all of these older novels of Janet's. They are an easy light read and the stories are fun.
2,back to bedroom,"This was a boring book. It was nothing like any of the other Janet Evanovich books I have read before. All the other books, I read the entire number and most of between the numbers, were excellent. This one really wasn't the same."
1,A disappointment,"Love her books, especially Stephanie Plum. All of her others are VERY good as well. This one is not. Could not finish the book."
4,Fun reading on a snowy winter day,"I like Janet Evanovich for light, entertaining reading and find the unlikely situations the female character finds herself in humorous. This book did not fail in that department. If you have never read any of her books try one."
1,Real Stinker,"Had I known how bad this book was, I would not have bought it. As it was, it would have been a waste of my time to get it for free.This was definitely not a book along the lines of the Stehanie Plum and more recent books by Janet Evanovich. I didn't realize it was actually written in the 80's.The story line was inane and confusing - what a disappointment."
4,Romantic and funny,This book was really funny and romantic . I rated the book four star because it kept you on your toes .
4,Back to the Bedroom,"This starts off as a cute love story, boy sees girl , boy loves girl ,however, a life lesson is soon developing. What we often believe , or think we need can be totally opposite of how our destiny develops, jumps hurdles, and endures."
5,Back to the Bedroom/Wife for Hire,Typical Evonovitch. Great for a laugh and books that I like to re-read. As usual Ms. Evonovitch has produced a perfect story line with comedy being the primary focus. Though her books certianly can't be considered real life there is enough of that involved to make a reader want to be there.
5,One line is not enough to say how good this book is!,"I look forward to reading his new book ""Good Food for Bad Stomachs"".I wish my GP had read this 10 years ago...(yes, I am bitter!)"
5,Perfect fit.,"A well made product engineered to fit well and requiring no tools to install. Functional and adds to appearance of my vehicle. See photos at ""allofherjoy"". This product is highly recommended- do not waste your time with the less expensive but poorly constructed models."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"I'm a big fan of Hooper's paranormal mysteries and was eagerly awaiting this latest in the series. However, a FBI agent who is missing her psychic abilities throughout most of the book is not what I was expecting from a Kay Hooper book. It was hard to get involved with the main characters when so little information was provided, and I found the Satan cult slant boring. I think the book would have benefited from bringing in one of the agents from her previous books."
2,Flawed,"Kay Hooper's ""Living With Fear"" starts out really well. Riley Crane, a federal agent with paranormal powers, wakes up covered with blood and with amnesia, and her powers don't work. She has been on a case for several weeks, and she has to figure out what is going on. She is probably in danger.But...as the book continues, there is a lot of repetitious dialogue, and the plot bogs down. There is very litte character development.While the author works in some back story in flashbacks fairly well, the story doesn't ultimately hang together. By the time the ending comes, it is no surprise, and it has the feeling of something carelessly slapped together.This is unfortunate, because there are some good ideas here and a good exposition. But the follow-through sags badly, failing to fulfill its promise, leaving the story and the reader unsatisfied."
1,Awful and disapointing!,"This game is one of the worst PC games I have ever played. The first one (for PS2) was great, it allowed you to swing freely around the roof tops and rooms. The second one however, makes you aim at targets that are a few feet from the wall of a building.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
1,THIS GAME F@#*ING SUCKS,"The only reason I gave this one star is because the web site made me! I got spiderman2 for pc for my birthday last year and almost smashed the computer because I was so pissed! Everything is controlled by the mouse. The colors look like something from telletubbies and the graphics just suck. There is no ""free roam"" only ""go this way because we are to f@$&ing lazy to make this game for anyone but 3-year-olds roam."" If you bought this game take it back. If you are about to DON'T!!!!!! SAVE YOURSELF THE HORRIBLE PAIN THIS GAME CAUSES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,chicken man,"I love this book and was so glad to get another copy to shareIt was a little bent, but it could have been on this end when it was put into the mailbox"
3,Not as well designed as official Blitzkrieg material.,"Given that the price of the product has dropped to below five dollars I figured it was a safe bet to give this add-on pack a try. Overall I was a bit disappointed as it doesn't meet the standards of the original BK game, Burning Horizons or Rolling Thunder. In some scenarios, there is an endless supply of reinforcements being sent which get in the way and by the time the battle is over were utterly useless anyway. One has you setting up quite an impressive array of armour and troops only to be attacked by 3 self-propelled guns and a couple hundred infantry. A bit of a let down after 20 minutes of hard thought out trench digging. In almost every scenario drawn, there are no supply depots, especially annoying in situations where historically you would be incredibly well supplied.In general, given the price, it's not a bad purchase. Just don't expect the more sensibly designed scenarios of the official game releases."
3,A better shooter,"Intense battles almost endless, seem to 'run out' of tanks, soldiers, and ammunition just before the end of the battle. However, the battles are the same old battles of the orginal. I would not recommend it as an add on. CDV could do much better."
5,Positive Classroom Discipline,This book is the book the that kept me teaching 1 year. I still use it today along with the Positive Classroom Instruction. I also give it to the new teacher in the building. Thanks V.
4,Biography that reads as a well-written novel,"This book begins with a murder - the mother (Aurora) killing her 17-year-old daughter (Hildegart). Hildegart was a political, feminist child-genius in Spain. Her major activity occurred between 1928-1933. She was a planned superwoman of her mother who raised her specifically to fulfill a political mission. The author has done an excellent job of portraying the socialist movement of the period and the roots of Aurora's project. There is the usual gap between words and deeds, the political deals, the self-serving compromises etc. But most of all there is a mother on a mission, ignoring and overriding anything for Hildegart that is outside Aurora's goal.Beautifully written, this book is very appropriate to our times. It shows in a sympathic way the dangers of fanaticism."
5,murder mystery/love story and spiritual too!!! great story!!,"This is an awesome story-it's a murder mystery and love story with some spirituality mixed in---it has a good message especially to people who have lost a loved one in their lives--I was told that even though this book was written as a fiction, it was based upon a true story---The story flows very nicely and keeps you in suspense also---I couldnt put it down once I started reading it---I recommend it highly for people who like murder mysteries and for people who like love stories too---it has something for everyone--"
1,The Plane Doesn't Fly Right,This toy did not work properly. The plane never took off as intended and did not deploy the paratroopers. We were very disappointed!
3,Hot Dog Costume,"Beware when buying this costume. Sure, it may look enticing, but it has major flaws. It can bring down your social life to almost nothing. I once wore it to a halloween party and was the laughing stock of the whole office.Not only was it extremely uncomfortable, but I tripped and ended up ripping the ""weiner"" portion of the hot dog in half. The mustard portion was ruined.A good purchase for any college party, but not one for office get-togethers. Remember to think before you risk your chance of losing your job (or integrity)."
2,hard read,this book is all over the place. I was on page 58 and realized I haven't really learned anything or following any concrete story.The Great Deluge is much better
3,Breach of Faith,"I enjoyed the book, I did prefer ""The Great Deluge."" My one major criticism of the book is that the author seemed very concerned with advancing an anti-Bush agenda and left out some very pertinent facts about Mayor Nagin and Governor Blanco. That's coming from a Democrat."
4,Good Map of Venezuela,"This is a nice map of Venezuela. A little pricey, but it does the job.I do though recommend though that for serious road travel in Venezuela that one gets a GPS having Venezuelan road maps. Road signs in Venezuela ore poor or non-existant so GPS, especially one that gives spoken directions, is the way to go."
2,Low Quality,"Bottle takes at least 5-6 pumps to get a spray going. As well, the product description doesn't specify if you're getting 1 or 3 bottles (you are getting 1 bottle). For $6 you'd be better off grabbing a few bottles of Windex and re-using the bottles afterwards."
2,Can't use this book,"I was in the section on tweening (which I've never done before), and I followed the author's instructions exactly, step by step. And, much to my dismay, the animation didn't work. I looked up the same subject in the Flash documentation and found that the author had failed to mention that I had to make a symbol out of the object to be tweened. IT WILL NOT WORK OTHERWISE! A simple but NECESSARY step was left out of this book's explanation. This book was expensive, too. What good is it if the book is well-written but leaves out critical information?I'd recommend instead the best book that I've found on this subject which was ""Foundation Flash 5"" by by Sham Bhangal, et al."
2,"OK, but not great","The shower bag is well-made, but it's not the easiest to fill. The big draw back is that the nozzle has to be unscrewed to get the water to flow. This takes two hands, and if you have soap on your hands, it's near impossible to do. And the flow of water is pretty weak, even when turned on full force. Previously I've used a black, cube-shaped shower bag which works quite well. I thought I'd try a different type, but I think I'll go back to the other one. A nice feature is the temperature gauge, so that when the bag is left in the sun, it's possible to know how well the water is heating."
2,Not like they used to be,"I had two bathrooms down for repair and pulled out my 30 year old Sun Showers to use for patio showers temporarily. Amazingly they were still usable. Within a few weeks they were finally showing their age so I bought two new ones. The new ones are now typical made in China crap. The shower hose is way too short, the valve takes two hands to operate and leaks badly, the cap security line broke the first time I filled the bag. They were innovative and quality 30 years ago but now it appears that they are just relying on their product name to sell this junk. It is not worth my time and effort to return these but I later discovered that there are much better products out there that do the same."
4,Great jig saw but it should come with 2 batteries,"I found this jig saw to do everything I needed it to, it cuts straight which my bosch doesn't, has all the power to cut through hard maple with ease, blade changes are easy, and it is cordless, no cord to trip on. The only complaint I have is that it comes with only one battery. Dewalt is currenty having a promotion which you get an extra battery but it takes 10 to 12 weeks to get. It is very frustrating waiting for a battery to charge and I really don't want to use my bosch while I wait. I would give it 5 stars if it came with 2 batteries"
5,Great Saw,"I have several Dewalt 18V tools and just got this one. Nice to always have a couple of charged batteries ready. It's a great saw and cuts really strong. Nice and compact, especially compared to my Bosch corded saw. Dust blower is better than average. When I use a jigsaw the cord always seems to be in the way or getting snagged on a corner. Blade holder seems very strong and stable. One note...it accepts T-shank blades ONLY."
1,PROBLEMS OUT OF THE BOX,"I think it may be a good saw if I ever get it out of the DeWalt repair center. When I received the saw it had a defective trigger, and the blade would not stay in the chuck. It has been in the shop since I received it and they say they can't parts (3 weeks). I think if I ever get it fixed I will like it."
5,What a great lounger!,Purchased two of these loungers. They are easy to assemble. Comfortable to use. Light weight yet strong. Being 18 inches off the ground makes for easy use. The fabric appears to be made of cotton. We put away the loungers when not in use (in pool shed). I felt that the sun would fad the color or worse. So far so good. Would buy again!
1,"cheaply made, terribly expensive china crap!","this chair was over ten times the cost of an average beach lounger. the materials were cheap, chair would not have lasted very long. it was very uncomfortable to sit in and extra cousions made it worse instead of better. do not waste your money on this product. we returned it one day after receiving it."
1,face down lounger,"I bought this lounger because I have orthostatic intolerance and need to lie down perfectly flat at times. I thought the face hole would be a plus when lying prone.I am a slender person but while lying face down on this chair, I have trouble finding a place to comfortably fit my arms and totally relax . My husband, who has a larger build and is broad shouldered, can't use the chair at all - face up or face down.Also, when the chair is flat and I want to lie on my back, I have to put the larger pillow under my head for comfort... but there is a bar located under the shoulder area that the fabric drapes over, so the bar digs into my back. It has some hard foam padding, but that doesn't help. It's very uncomfortable.After using this chair for almost a month, I would recommend it only to very petite people who like to lie face down, but can't keep their heads turned while doing so. And with the caveat that even then, it's not very comfortable."
2,wire puzzle holder,"The wire puzzle holder I received did not work as well as I expected. One might think, as I did when I ordered it, how complicated could this be. Well, when it is put together as a rectangle, as opposed to a trapezoid, the puzzles keep falling out of the slots. It is only slightly better than having my grandkids' puzzles stacked on top of each other."
2,A bit disappointing,Specifically bought a Melissa and Doug puzzle holder as we have a lot of their puzzles - but not all of the puzzles fit! the thicker sized ones (usually musical) are to thick to fit in the slots of the holder.Otherwise it's exactly what it says.
2,shouldn't m&d storage fit m&d puzzles?,"This wire storage case is well made, but unfortunately poorly sized. The puzzle slots are too wide, particularly in the back, and not quite tall enough. It is difficult to line-up puzzles to fit in a single slot, and when not level and in 1 slot, puzzles tend to fall. My otherwise dexterous 3-year-old is not able to line-up her Melissa & Doug wooden puzzles in a single slot. M&D; puzzles with sound (e.g.Melissa & Doug Musical Instruments Sound Puzzle (2009))are a very tight squeeze, M&D; chunky pieces (e.g. Melissa & Doug Farm Chunky Puzzle) take up 2 slots, and don't even bother with M&B; baby puzzles (e.g.Melissa & Doug Pets Jumbo). Most of our older wooden puzzles are too narrow to be contained by this wire case."
1,waste of money,This was such a waste of money. It only holds the small Melissa and Doug puzzles and it is very difficult to slide the puzzles in. The spaces are also very close together so if you have puzzles with peg pieces you have to skip a rack.
2,"not worth the aggravation unless you only purchase ""standard"" size puzzles...","I thought that this would be a great solution for organizing my son's puzzles, but unfortunately it was anything but - it only fits the ""standard"" size puzzles and will not fit the thicker melissa and doug puzzles, its ""legs"" that it stands on are not capped with anything to protect the floor and/or your child's safety - needless to say, I returned this to the store and went back to using a box as storage."
3,"Great idea, but not well-executed","I wanted a way to store my 2-year-old's wooden puzzles (mostly made by Melissa and Doug) so that they would be organized and she could access them as needed. So far I've been pretty frustrated with this wire storage.It doesn't seem to fit puzzles well and they get stuck when taking them in and out of the slots. I can deal with this (although it's annoying) but my daughter is pretty much unable to remove and store the puzzles because they do not go in and out smoothly.Also, it slides around on the shelf, making it even more difficult to remove and put back the puzzles.So, great idea, but needs some adjustments so it really works."
3,"Ok, but not good for thicker puzzle","We needed a place to store our daughter's puzzles, and thought this would be the perfect solution.....it's ok, but it does not accomodate some thicker puzzles. We figured that a Melissa & Doug puzzle rack would accomodate the variety of sizes that they manufacture, but unfortunately not. Our M&D latch boards are left out in the cold. Maybe I should have read more carefully to see if it mentioned rack size."
3,Does not fit all Melissa and Doug puzzles,"I had anticipated that since this rack was made by Melissa and Doug, all of their standard puzzles would fit in it. However, two of the puzzles we own (Sea Life and Dinosaurs) do not fit in the rack properly. The puzzle pieces are too close to the edge of the puzzle, making it difficult, if not impossible, to get the puzzles in the rack. The Sea Life is also too tall, so we cannot put it anywhere but at the top, or else we would not be able to fit another puzzle above it. I'm disappointed because I had hoped to have all of my son's puzzles neatly stacked together. I'm a little surprised this wasn't better designed."
2,Don't bother,"This wire rack tips over, has metal bars that stick out and are dangerous, and doesn't fit all wooden puzzles. It is more of a hassle than a help."
1,Does not fit puzzles!,"My two year old daughter has a half dozen M&D puzzles, and - they do not fit the wire rack. They are off (too big) by about a half inch or so. They are definitely M&D puzzles. I have to return it."
3,Needs a base.,This storage case would be much more user friendly if it had a heavy wooden base or something similar to keep it in place. When my daughter tries to take a puzzle out of it the entire thing moves and all the other puzzles fall out. The case could be a bit narrower so there isn't as much play between the case and the puzzles. I have fixed this by bending it in a little and I also cut a wooden base to help keep it in place when she tries to take a single puzzle out.
1,Mediterranean Chips,This product has milk in it and I cannot eat milk. I would never have bought it had I seen that it contained milk.
3,Love the game but...,I love the premise of the game ... but it is hard to play the way the instructions are written. We changed the way we play and my 5 1/2 year old loves it and has really enjoyed searching for the states and learning a little something about each...
3,Great States Junior,"Fun game for children who are beginning to read. For the others you can make it more educational than it might be intended to be, but it has its limits"
5,extremely relaxing!,"I'm new to whole world of yoga and decided to purchase this CD collection based on amazon reviews. I use this CD everyday for meditation and relaxation. Shiva Rea has a very soothing voice with beautiful music in the back ground to accompany her. If you are looking for a very well rounded collection, this is a good bet. Once again, I'm always so pleased with Amazon - they're so helpful in making an informed decision on new purchases!"
1,Ouch...,"I have to say, of all the anime I've seen, this was the worst. It should deffinatly have a higher age rating. I would never let a 13 year old watch this. Its just got too much graffic nudity. The plot wasn't that great, and it didn't make a whole lot of sense. However, there were parts that weren't bad, and some might enjoy it. By at your own risk."
3,Trying to stretch something that's already whacked out,"The 2-episode OVA deals with Maze and friends in the kingdom of Babylon. While it's only a single event in an RPG timeline, the producers decided to load this with tons of slapstick and fan service (hence the nudity and the quiz shows). Of course they could have toned it down (and removed the scene where male Maze raped Mix and turns out she liked it) Other than that you won't like the characters unless you watch the TV series. The concept is slightly different from Ranma because we have two different personalities inhabiting the same body (unlike Ranma who as a girl somehow retains his male preferences and attitude) An OVA should be a retelling of a TV series with fewer episodes and more artistry, but here they just went crazy. It's still watchable and enjoyable, but watch the TV series first if you don't want to be put off--they shouldn't have released this before the series. The 13up rating should be a 17up."
3,Good for UNIX box scripts,This book was a quick tour of Perl. Well-written but has typos (and I had to figure these out with no prior knowledge of Perl!) and only a few of the examples I tried actually worked. I use it as a general Perl reference now but it is totally geared towards UNIX and we have a Novell webserver. Minimal help there. This book is primarily useful in that it's not overly intimidating like some other Perl primers. Just a so-so text for me but probably very useful if you plan to only work in UNIX.
2,Radio Controlled Phantom Air Striker Airplane RC3,"This plane is prone to a lot of crashes. Not very easy to fly. If you already have a unit and have not flown it yet, make sure you trim the plane by launching it without the motor on and ensure that it can glide propperly. I would not recommend this unless you have some prior aeromodelling expertise."
5,"And if you think THIS is GREAT, Read his book ""Scarecrow""","How this CD never achieved the notoreity it deserved I don't know. It's breathtaking. It is so uncompromising and so passionate that you feel stupid and cowardly for not having the courage this man has. But if you want something even better, read Jabanoski's book ""Scarecrow""(he was in Iraq as a reporter from the time when we invaded until a few monthes after we ""took control"" of Baghdad.) This CD is breathtaking. ""Scarecrow"" is something so powerful that you can't describe it to anyone who's never read it. One of the true geniuses of our lifetimes and THE MOST versatile.To the one reactionary Bush puppet that gave this CD one star. Yeah right. Like someone like you ever BOUGHT a CD with this title to comment on its musical and artistic quality. You can't even spell the word ""disgrace"" properly. Makes me think that George W himself wrote that review."
2,Clif Bar - Chocolate Brownie - Disappointing Flavor,I expected a sweet taste from this bar since my experience with other Clif Bar flavors have been on the sweet side. I was extremely disappointed with the flavor of this energy bar. It's nutritous but lacking in flavor.
2,Not for professionals,The nylon may be heavy duty but the sides collapse and it is not designed for heavy use. There are not enough divisions and compartments.
2,I agree with the first review,"A DVD is a DVD. Tell the producers, you look at it. Got that...you look at it. The bass player just stands there looking at his music stand, as if he was actually in the 4th dimension. Also when the keyboard player is clacking away on his toy drum set, all I can say is ""Stop!"".Too much ""over the top"" all the time."
2,Don't wast your money,My daughter got the secret safe as birthday gift. Her excitement soon turned to frustration when she could not get the safe to open. You have to say the password exactly the same each time and even then it does not open. Even after entry into the safe was granted the door jamed and would not open. We took this one back and got another one. After trying to open it 5 or 6 times she put it on the shelf and said forget it. Good idea but to hard for 6 year olds or even adults to open.
2,Not a real Aprilaire product,"I don't know how to evaluate whether these are good or not, but I thought I was buying a genuine Aprilaire product and this wasn't, it was a generic replacement. Since the price was not as cheap as most of the generic ones I found, I was not pleased."
1,Not as happy as I thought I would be,It was not as big as I thought it would be. The chalkboard side needs a wet towel in order for it to get cleaned. The dry erase board will not come completely clean and we have only used the pen provided. Most of the chalk was broken in the box when we received it. The eraser is very thin and almost sounds like it is scraping the board.
3,good for crafts,"Definitely not DMC quality, but good for crafts [scrapbooking, decoupage, collages, etc] and friendship bracelets. Okay for needlepoint, embroidery and cross-stitch if you're not worried about high quality projects. I've used it for Christmas ornaments and bookmarks with satisfactory results."
2,Problem after problem,"This program would be great, but you have to figure out how to do it all on your own. Tech support for pinnacle is terrible, and there are no instructions. There is a manual, but it is not very helpful. I kept running into little gliches in the program where I would be working on a project and all of the sudden something would quit working until I shut the program down and restarted it. If there were decent instructions with it and the program would work right every time I used it, I would love it."
1,Are they Kidding???,"This product is horrible.The images of trucks, vehicles, cars are toys!! This is not a product that can be used professionally by a company looking to keep desktop publishing in-house.Even for free-lance work, most of these images are too cheesy to use...I would be embarrassed.There are far too many photo objects of the same item from different angles. More of a variety would be nice. I haven't yet found one photo object I can use either for our web-site, marketing material or ads.Suggestion: Unless the images on the box are exactly what you need & the only images you need, DO NOT waste your time.If only there were a way for us to view a comprehensive set of thumbnails before considering purchase.....Very disappointed, wish Amazon had negative star ratings."
5,I bought it for one song,I bought this for there rendition of Peace Train and was amazed at their sound! An excellent album with many excellent tunes.
4,"I bought this camera several years ago, and it's still works!","I bought this camera several years ago, and it's still works.I bought this camera for video analysis with my golf and tennis club members and to shoot videos for my academy online. It works great. The only problem with it is that the USB connection is where the battery goes, so when you want to connect it to a pc or laptop, you HAVE TO use a power outlet. There are other minor things that could be changed or added, but nothings perfect. If they would have put a little more effort into the design, it would be a solid five. However, I know it may have been a few more bucks to move the USB port. Overall, for the money I paid for it, it still works good."
2,not impressed,"i bought this camcorder as a demo model back in april 2008 only used it 1 time,and when i went to use it in july 2008 it would not play any mini dv tapes,so i tryed another one,and it did not work out at all,so i contacted the store where i got it from,they said since you dont have a warranty with us,then you have to contact the manufacture,so i did, and oh my gosh,what a load of junk you have to go through.all automatated system. and no person able to talk to at all.so if you buy this camera and it breaks,good luck trying to get it repaired.sony is so much better customer service.i have other products that are sony and always able to get ahold of a live person. and to make matters worse,panasonics web site for supports link are not avalible anymore,interesting ..."
3,Camera is Ok.,"- Initially I ordered SDR-H200 (which is also 3CCD), but it was getting heated up so I returned it and ordered GS320..- GS320 was no match for SDR-H200 in terms of quality of picture.- Other drawback was to transfer the recorded media onto Laptop. No faster way other than playing it back again.- So I returned GS320 and ordered Panasonic SDR-H200 again. I took my chance but luckly the heating problem is not there. Probably it was with the previous piece."
2,Sleepy selection of randomenss,"This collection of short stories by Greg Bear (his first collection published) feels as if he scoured his desk drawers looking for anything to fill the pages of this collection. His main focus was, obviously, the short story Blood Music. It's great, but the book is even more epic. And the only other story which seems to fit well into a Greg Bear short story collection would be Sisters. This is a sort of precursor to his future society based books Queen of Angels and Slant. Sisters is a healthy grassroots look at being a simple teenager in simple future times.The rest of the stories range wildly and annoyingly from 1) a story about a man and a magical prostitute, 2) a woman and her dictionary-born boy-toy, 3) a news article about the (quite dated) future of computer graphics and animation.If you're looking for Bear SF, then look no further than The Venging, which has heaps of hard SF in a number of presentable not-pulled-from-the-back-of-his-desk-drawer stories."
2,"A showy book on fashion accessories, not about horology","This is a beutifully produced book, and a usefull title to have laying on your coffee tabel if you want to impress your friends about your ""sophictication"" and discreetly introduce them to the subject that you collect expensive contemporary wristwatches.It was obviously written with the support of the manufacturers of these geourgeous mechanisms and for much of its course quotes verbatim from their official corporate histories and utilisis the imagery of their advertising a PR departments.It is however not the book to turn to for factual and objective -including critical- information about specific modelsor makers or to learn more about the technology and history of watches.Fortunat Mueller-MaerkiChairman of the National Watch and Clock Library"
5,button end elastic dress suspenders,"I have bought two pair of the button end elastic dress suspenders for my husband who has developed a bit of a tummy. The pants and belt settled for staying below the tummy. Now the pants sit where they belong, and the new suspenders are quite good looking--and so is he. We like them so much that we might buy a couple more colors!"
2,Very Small,These mini chests appear much larger than they are. The drawers fit barely anything inside.
4,Great Short Stories!,I thought this book was typical of the 'not so typical' lifestyles so many of us lead. The author has really opened herself up and let out her true emotions on her experiences with life. She is witty and has a certain spunk about her we grow to love. I would recommend this book to my friends.
1,This Seller is Awful.,"I ordered this item on Sunday with prime and it is now Thursday and the package never arrived. Tracking says it got re-routed and no further status is available. I ordered another item from Amazon yesterday and that item arrived today. Who knows if I will ever see the product, but I do not recommend using this seller."
5,My mom's taking it!,"She has lost 25 lbs, without doing anything other than taking hydrolyzed collagen twice a day! Plus, she has rhuematoid arthritis and that has helped with range of motion in her hands, which are covered with arthritis nodules! I am going to start taking in for weight loss and to prevent the RA which runs in my family!"
5,I like it,I like this produt and work perfect but is to big make feel nervous every time I take one but is great quality come on time and in perfect shape too
4,"Amazing backpack, but needs more room to expand when full!!!","I gave this backpack to my boyfriend for Christmas and he really loves it. His only complaint is that it doesn't hold as much stuff as he would like it to. It has several really great inside pockets and compartments (and some even velcro so you can pull them in and out) which is really convenient, but it just doesn't really expand large enough to actually fill all of the compartments. He feels very secure riding public transit in a large city everyday with this backpack."
4,"Great backpack, but....","Purchased this backpack to carry my 17.3"" laptop. The laptop fits very nicely, seems very protected. Like the security features, and seems to be very comfortable to wear, even loaded down. The only thing I would change would be the bottom be a little flatter, that would allow you to carry a bit more accessories. Would definitively recommend."
2,Mobile Edge SecurePack 17-inch Backpack,"Very confortable back pack with nice yellow glare stripes for the night ride on a motorcycle. Also it is cool and a good air flow while riding the Motorcycle.I bought this to use it when I ride my Motorcycle. It is comfortable and I think it is a good size for my 17 inch laptop.For my accessories of my laptop, I had to use the inside zipper packet to put my laptop cord but it is not designed for that.Also, the description of this backpack, stays that has front packets for your cell phone, but I could not put my G4 LG in there cause the packet is to small, way to small not even a regular new style phone will fit in there. Also no bottle water packets and last but not least, the way to put the laptop in you have to fold back the straps to be able to slide it in. Overall I will give it a 4.5"
3,Good for IT Guy's,"I bought this back pack to carry my work laptop, iPad, external HD and supplies I need on a typical day on the job. I also wanted it as something I could carry when I go to overnight conferences and was hoping it would be all I would need for Laptop, iPad, change of clothes, and hygiene kit. It does well for my daily routine, but there is no way I am taking it to a conference. It holds both my 15.4"" screen HP DV6 laptop and my First Generation Dell XPS 17"" laptop with no problem. The XPS is a MASSIVE laptop so it should hold ANY laptop you put in it. If you are looking at this for a school laptop trust me when I say you will be lucky to fit your laptop, a txt book and a notebook. I would consider this to be an ""IT guy"" laptop. If you are looking for an awesome back pack with plenty of storage space check out the Upscale OGIO Metro Nylon Backpack with Laptop Pocket . I reviewed it too."
3,Caution,"I wish the author would have cautioned the readers of this book regarding marriage and dishabituation. The elements of a marriage are more complicated than the author maintains. An already unsure man fearing for the end of his marriage might change to please his wife who then regrets what she has created. Not all women will want the strong-minded man this book creates. Not all men, having become strong-minded, will stay with wives they no longer need.When you and your new bride were picking out household items, did she want permission or agreement? What changed?"
3,Dewalt 1/4 sheet palm sanders,"There was a time when these were the best on the market. They seemed to have changed the feet material that the base plate is attached to since production moved south. Now, they tend to break and spin the plate, causing us to have to scrap them. I believe that calling them heavy duty is quite a stretch."
2,Guess I got what I paid for....,"Dewalt's supposed to have a good reputation. I have their biscuit cutter & it is pretty accurate. But this sander needs help.I guess you can't buy this sander without the dust collection. I removed it. I don't use punched paper because it tears on corners & edges. (but of course, the pad still has holes in it.) & speaking of pads: it's real thin. Not nearly the heft or quality of my old Porter Cable which died after about 25 years.In using the sander, I found it didn't sand nearly as quickly or thoroughly as the PC. Then I found out why! the cheap plastic base is warped! so on a flat surface only two corners are even touching the surface. I think the warp is caused by the heavy clips that hold plain sandpaper to the pad.My warrantee is long gone, so I guess I'll look into replacing the base with something substantial. If I break something I won't really be losing much."
2,Now I have the Squeal!,"Everything works fine and without any screeching sounds. Only two disapointments was the bag it came with. It is barely big enough to fit the sander. It looks much bigger in the pic, and the way the sheets mount with a spring clip. After how many years you would think there would be a better way. Other than that it does a good job.UPDATE....AFTER A COUPLE OF USES I NOW HAVE THE SQUEAL! PROBABLY WILL HAVE TO RETURN IT."
4,Love it,Purchased this after my B&D 1/3 sander died after 12 years. So far tis does exactly what it should. I buy the full sheets of paper and cut them into 1/4's. Saves money on paper. Motor is a lot quieter than my old B&D.
5,really nice,Bought this for my teenage son. It's warm without being cloying. Keeps the wind off nicely. Make sure to buy a bigger size than you think you'll need and wash before wearing. It's a bit stiff at first.
5,"Dickies duck, blanket lined jacket","I truly like the fit of the jacket.Great product at an awesome price. Great fit, I would have no problem recommending this jacket to friends and family."
2,Too Short!,"I agree with the other guy who said this jacket is way too short! I am 5""11 wich is not too tall or too short but this jacket needs to be offered in a long tail size. Everytime I put my arms up my jackets pulls up. I normally use a 3x but I went ahead and got a 4x and still the jacket was a little bit bigger but still was way too short. Not only was it short but it was too wide! I like the design and how the jacket looks online but u have to be a short fat wide guy for it to fit your body. Unless you fit this description I would not recommend this jacket. Mine is in the attic collecting dust."
4,doable,"Definitely a ""doable"" work-out; helped me stay active as I got huge. Yoga section helpful, too."
1,"good idea, poor execution","I like the idea. I like the idea so much, upon seeing itI bought two on the spot, one for me, and one for mydaughter, so she could share listening to her music onan upcoming band trip.Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work. Neither of them.At least, with the apple earbuds. I need to hunt downanother headphone to see if it'll work, but frankly, ifit won't work with the earbuds, that's unacceptable.I'll be returning them."
3,"headphones good, program is the problem","I don't use this very often because it doesn't work very fast; that's not the microphones fault the Microsoft voice recognition program is the problem but one of the previous customers said that MS was better than Dragon so Dragon must be a POS. I have Skype, maybe it'll work well there???"
4,little plasticy... but not bad,"Its great in terms of functionality, but the finish and materials (foam) could use a little improvement. I don't think that's too much to ask for $10."
2,"weak mike, poor for music",The title tells it. Sound is loud but terribly unbalanced and varies dramatically with position of phones on ears. Best position is uncomfortable and still too poor to use for music. At least it's loud.
2,Not worth the time or money,"I decided to buy these because of the wrap around on the ears and on the reviews the product received. It does not feel comfortable on my ears and I have a small head. The mic is adjustable which is nice. From what I'm told, I sound good to those I am talking to. However the sound quality on these headphones are terrible compared to my Logitech headphones. I pretty much set up the headphones and used it for 15 minutes before tossing them to my boyfriend to use since he broke his mic. If you're looking for quality sounds for a good price, try Logitech."
3,"OK product, not suitable for prolonged usage",Sound quality is ok for the price. The plastic is a bit hard and starts biting your ears if you use it continuously (for more than an hour). It would have been nice if the headphones had come with a volume control knob and an on/off switch for the microphone.
1,Pinches your noggin!,"Pros: It looks cool & won't mess up your hair.Cons: Pinches tightly in front of my ears. Cannot wear it for long. Pick up sounds just OK. I use it with Dragon and it misses quite a bit. I've had much better accuracy with other microphones.After one month, the microphone ceased to function making these useless.Save yourself the headache and look elsewhere.I would not recommend this product."
1,BAD microphone,"I got this earphone today and started using it. Everyone was telling me ""I can't hear you, please speak up!"", after placing the mic almost into my mouth they could just about hear me with a muffled sound!Verdict: The sound quality for this earphone isn't too bad (although I would not use this to listen to music). BUT the microphone is just unusable. I'm off to Skype to buy the FREETALKheadset. I had that for almost a year and that's a suburb piece of equipment."
1,Reviewing the BOOK not the SELLER here,"This book reads like the instruction manual for a rocket ship. I don't think I learned a single thing from it because I gave up trying to understand it after the introductory chapter. So many quotations from the original theorist with no explanation or examples. It was impossible to read. Ugh, waste of a semester."
4,Lawrence Talbot's Most EXCELLENT Adventure,"Lawrence Talbot, werewolf, is deep in trouble. The good people of Innsmouth are looking to end the world again, and are more than willing to sacrifice anything or anyone to do so.While the eerie but lumpy artwork is certainly dismissable, Neil Gaiman's story is crisp and entertaining. Even though it lacks the depth of Sandman or the horror of Babycakes, Larry Talbot's story is a fun, five-minute read."
1,Worst Blender Ever,"After I dissembled blender to clean, it no longer fit properly on the stand. Very unsatisfied and do not have the time to repackage, return and go to post office. Would never purchase another product from them, but love Amazon. Maybe I can get some guidance on the easiest way to fix this.Thank you, Craig AshtonI love Amazon!"
1,Awful - so much for higher priced Cuisinart,"We use a blender about once a week for smoothies and crushed ice. We had a Black and Decker than burned out in less than 6 months, so we got this more expensive, supposedly higher quality Cuisinart as a replacement. It did a great job blending a smoothie, but it smelled like burning plastic with the first use and stopped working completely during the 3rd use - so it was promptly returned.Also, the pitcher was awful other than the size. The lid was hard to use and it was impossible to pour a smoothie without spilling. Because it blended so well, we would have tried a replacement unit for the initial unit that quit, but couldn't tolerate the mess created with pouring."
1,junk,"Bought this blender 10 months ago. It fried on the 5th use. Spent $20 shipping to cuisinart, this covered both ways, 2nd use when it came back it fried again. This product is junk. This is a good blender if you want one to look at sitting on the counter. The trouble starts when you use it, but trust me you won't have trouble very long, just the odor of burned electrical parts."
3,Cuisinart SPB-10CH: All That Glitters is Not Chrome,"This blender works well and has a heavy glass cup and plastic lid. The buttons are large and easy to read. The base is not chrome, but a heavy shiny plastic, which looks a bit cheap to me. I am getting used to it, however. For the price, I expected a better blender and a better base material. I replaced a less expensive blender which worked just as well, without the nicer overall design and Cuisinart name. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the base stays shiny and does not chip to a black undercoat."
3,Good Information but lousy maps,"Time Out Tokyo provides good cultural information -- restaurants, musuems, stores, etc. Unfortunately, it does not contain even the basics in terms of maps. Many of the recommended sites are not on any map in the book, and there is no overall map.The Lonely Planet Tokyo City Guide is far better in terms of maps and other logistical information, such as where trains run and when. On the other hand, Time Out is clearly better when it comes to what to see and do. So, take your pick, or take both!"
4,Blow-by-blow Account of Manson Murders,"There is a ton of information here, almost too much. I understand Manson and his group moved around alot, but I really didn't need to know about every time they moved (they were nomadic alot of the time). The writing style is almost journalistic, with occasional anachronistic side commentary. This book, which covers the story up to (but not including) the trial(s), will tell you probably everything you ever want to know (or didn't want to know, as the case may be). Exhaustive and exhausting."
4,Important music theory all crammed into one disk.,"I would recommend watching this in multiple sittings, A lot of the concepts are foundations. This DVD helps you understands concepts from the book that may be confusing."
1,Broadcasted from Hell,"If you think devil worship is cool then this is the video for you. Why the instructor decided to dress up like the Grim Reaper and look like he is broacasting from hell, I will never know. But I for one do not find it funny."
2,Noisy!,"I've had an earlier model of this same sander for several years. I decided the old one was getting past it's prime so decided buy a newer model. What a mistake! DeWalt changed the design of the slow start pad and as a result this new sander is about 10 times louder then the old one. It probably vibrates more too, but to tell you the truth I'm so distracted by the loud buzz that it's hard to tell.If I wanted a loud, high vibration sander I could have gotten one a lot cheaper!"
5,Nice orbital sander,I am of the opinion you cannot got wrong with Dewalt tools and this sander is no exception. Buy alot of paper and sand away! No problems so far.
5,All you need to know about NYC,This guidebook gives you all the information you will need for a fun weekend--or week--in NYC. It even includes sample itineries to help you map out a course that won't have you running around the city confused. Leave the rest of the guidebooks at home. This one is all you need.
2,Just OK.,Fun names for some of them. Not an inclusive pack of all players. Cards don't even feel coated or professional. Kinda weird. Only real value is to see fun names from the past.
1,Disappointing,"..these 3 have worldwide status and have produced some amazing tracks so I can't understand why they put this out. The album lacks quality, imagination, energy, and inspiration. There isn't one G funk influnced track on the album but a lot of slow/mid tempo stuff. I've tried listening to this twice and managed skipping the whole CD in a short space of time. To you Gangsta listeners out there, don't waste your money....i ain't gonna go on any more about this album so if you don't believe me..buy it!"
5,Hottest CD of 2004,"I bought this cd after hearing the track ""So Fly."" This entire CD is a compilation that hasn't been heard for some time. Forget the Fat Joe, Lil Jon, and Petey Pablo, these dudes(Snoop Dogg, Warren G, and Nate Dogg) are bringing that classic west cost flavor to the summer of 2004. This is a MUST HAVE cd. Numbers 10 and 19 are the hottest tracks. 10 has a true classic taste to it. Go get it before you miss out on something good."
3,213 is average,"I had bought the bootleg over a month ago in LA with different songs along with 5 songs that are on the new album and to be honest, the bootleg was actually alot nicer than the real album. The only songs that are good on the new album are MLK, Absolutely, Mary Jane, and Dirty Hoe. Where was the picnic song that was slammin in the bootleg and where was the song that has the ""Earth wind and fire"" beat on the new album. MLK I would say is the best song on the album which by the way was also on the bootleg. I also miss I Need me a bitch, that is on the bootleg and not on the album. It was kind of disapointing to say the least."
1,Bring back Bushwick and get rid of Willie-D.....,"Arrrrgggghhh! This was the worst Geto Boys offering I have heard to date! Obviously Scarface wasn't enough to save this ""album"". Why wasn't Bushwick in on this one? Most of the songs were performed by Willie-D and I'm sorry but Willie-D can't rap! There isn't one single song on this album that I would refer to anyone! This GB product deserves to be put in the trash. I'm a true Geto Boys fan and I say to other GB fans out there: DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!"
4,Great everyday cologne,"This is a very good fragrance at an incredible price. It used to be Frank Sinatra's choice once his original favorite, Yardley English Lavender, became discontinued. It truly is a very nice all-around scent. Masculine, subtle, not at all a ""cheap scent"".For the bargain shopper, there is still a way to find the original 100ml green glass bottle, which looks nicely old-fashioned in a bathroom cabinet. Just use these 25 oc plastic bottles as a refill. Designer fragrance nowadays is ridiculously expensive, and with Agua Lavanda you truly buy similar quality, just without the hype.The fragrance doesn't last much more than an hour, and this is the reason I didn't give 5 stars."
3,Mis-labeled product,"If the bottle contains 25.5 oz. it is the ""body splash"" rather than the cologne, and yes it comes in a cheap plastic bottle. The stuff sold in this listing is *not* cologne. It's good stuff if you like a body splash, but does not have a long-lasting scent like a cologne."
4,Excellent Companion,"I'm a beginning/intermediate runner. This book has been an excellent guide and reference. After running for a year-- with a 5 month break for an unrelated injury-- I'm planning a half marathon in a few months. I started reading this book on a recommendation of the Galloway run/walk philosophy. I started employing this in my runs and I have seen a major improvement in all areas-- pace, health/pains, and enjoyment of the run. I highly recommend this book and a consideration of the philosophies and recommendations it offers. The only negative is that it could have used a better editor and a better photographer/photo quality."
3,Training Plans,A little weak for an e reader confused on the various training plans. Nice approach to a concept that allows walking...very diifferent than Higdon's style. Plan to try the approach during my marathon training this spring.
3,gghej hej med dig hvordan gr det hvordan gr det her gr de,i like this cd very much i think the kelly family rocks they make some really good music and i think they did to when they where younger
1,What's wrong with this...book about pictures?,"I haven't read this book beyond what was available under ""Look inside this book,"" but there's something highly questionable about a study of movie musicals the completely omits Li'l Abner. Abner's one of the best musicals of the 50s and to leave it out isn't right. I was going to put this on my wish list, but now I don't think I will."
5,Some of the best music ever writen,"Got the hookups from a exchange student lent me a copy some of the most amazing music i have ever heard, i own everything they have and use it all the time at dances..."
5,Japanese Animae,"Japanese animation at it's best. Great entertainment for young adults, budding writers,and artists. Great series for the young at heart."
4,Sander,"This sander seems to be working fine, my only fault that it is made in a foreign country. If I had known this I probably would not have purchased it. I try to stick with tools made in the USA. I know that it is getting harder to find any tools still made here but if we all would quit buying these products made elsewhere maybe this would stop."
2,"Better than some, but still lacking","For surveillance you still want better resolution to identity a suspect.Also minus a couple points since configuration software and viewer is windows Internet Explorer specific.Doesn't support WPA encryption. Didn't want to run unsecured for obvious reasons. However, if I used WEP, the rest of the network would capped at 56Mbps and need to be reconfigured. Why should the rest of the network be slowed down because of a camera?"
2,Media Helper,"With all due respect to other reviewers seeking to be kinder or wait and see, this young man has had incredible luck or promotion. It is a similar ""boom I'm here!"" star media arrival that his mentor, Harry Connick had that makes for detractors. Although somewhat of a Sinatra mimmick, Connick nevertheless possessed prodigy type startling pianistic and vocal skills at Cincotti's age. I'm sure that many fans have had the same experience: they see Cincotti's poster on a NY street corner with the glowing NY Times review ""Becoming Legendary!"" and say to themselves, ""ok let me check this guy out"". They go buy the record and go--""gee what's all the fuss?"". You need something really special and different to cut through these days given how many people are out there-(ie Norah Jones, Diana Krall and even non-jazzer Josh Groban). Best of luck to him--an obviously nice kid who loves jazz and studied it but the music biz is tough!"
5,Jazz piano sings standards,"I'm not sure why you would compare him to Sinatra, Peter Cincotti is a Jazz PIANIST, who happens to do vocals, ala similiar to Harry Connick Junior, in that Mr. Connick Jr. is a jazz pianist. Frank Sinatra was a crooner. As for the worst song writer ever, that's a bit harsh since a number of these songs are old standards and one of the songs he wrote on here he did when he was like 14 or something and was pretty great.This is a very nice cd if you like standards, and you like jazz piano. His voice is not awful, it's just not what you expect. I really like the version he does, it is not on this cd, however, of I like Paris.You might like Cincotti if you feel warm and fuzzy over Harry Connick or possibly Steve Tyrell (not a great voice but pleasant with standards)."
2,This is Harry Connick's twin,"I fell for the hype about this kid and purchased the CD. He can play reasonably well but just reasonably. His voice is o.k. but nothing to shout about. He doesn't pose a threat to any of the better known jazz pianists of today. Every tune on this CD sounds like every other tune. He may improve, he's still very young. He will have to improve before I purchase one of his CD's in the future."
3,A little disappointed,It's hung and up so we'll try again next summer. My son is 16 months old and I should have just gone with an all around rubber but I was hoping this would work if I just watched him. He slips right out of the bottom. If it will hold him in next summer (he's 2 in May) I'll definitely update this review and give it 1 extra star. I had read the other reviews and I thought it would work since some of the kids referenced were young too.
3,Worth a look,I buy all types of design books. I recommend this book if you like the idea of high style without spending a fortune on a house. I designed and built my passive solar home 30 years ago and now I'm shopping for ideas for a home my daughter will enjoy and can afford both now in the future. This book has lots of color photos of wonderful living environments built on a budget. If you're thinking about building a house add it to your stack...
4,The Cell/Life Science Library,"The Cell is one of twenty-six volumes in the Life Science Library. Originally published in the 1960s, this series is an introduction to the many fields of science. This volume introduces the reader to the fundamental unit of all living organisms. Topics covered include cell theory, parts of the cell and their function, photosynthesis, respiration, heredity, mitosis, meiosis, DNA, theories on the origins of life, embryology, the mechanics of muscle power, nerve cells, antibodies, viruses, and the immune system. Each chapter is supplemented with picture essays which enhance the narrative. The book includes a glossary defining the most essential terms in the vocabulary of cellular biology. Though a bit dry and technical at times (and obviously dated) I found this book to be a succinct and informative survey on the building blocks of all life."
3,General overview,A short rather brief history of the 10th Mountain Division in Italy. A general overview of the battles fought but nothing too detailed. Detailed individual accounts exist and are much more interesting.
5,life changing,"As a reader of Oswald Chambers work, I was anxious to read more about the man. This book was life-changing, spiritually challenging and inspiring. Although an ""easy"" read in many respects, it's content was not easy to digest. I found it thought provoking and a time of self-examination. It's difficult to identify any current day lives so devoted not to ""what God does, but who God is"", as Oswald Chambers refers to early in the book. It's a book one would recommend without hesitancy."
4,BIOGRAPHY OF OSWALD CHAMBERS. ABANDONED TO GOD,"OSWALD CHAMBERS: ABANDONED TO GOD.This is a fairly detail biography of a man who gave his heart and soul completely to Jesus, just like Dwight L. Moody. The book tells of his struggle with surrendering his will to Jesus and then the wisdom and peace he got from accomplishing that. It tells of his life with his wife, then his early demise at age 43. His wife gathered his sermons and lectures she took while he preached and taught; then she wrote them into books. The most notable is written by her from his material: MY UTMOST FOR MY HIGHEST."
2,pretty light fare,"Not a lot to this book. Like several other reviewers I was drawn in by the title (not a big fan of the show, but the book sounded interesting). Unfortunately there's only a single chapter on non-PC humor, the rest is just rattling off various examples of liberal media bias. The chapters on conservative bloggers and publishing companies were just painful - ""these are the ones I like, these are the ones I don't,"" in as many words. It's only 160 pages long so there's not much meat on the bone, but save yourselves 20 bucks and check it out from the library if you have to."
1,"""Passion of the Jew"", ""Christian Rock Hard""...",South Park is conservative?? Alrighty then!I hope those stuffed shirts running the GOP don't ban it!
4,"You may think you are ""all tied up"" until you read this book","Bondage lovers, pervos, and D/s enthusiasts, apart, the author describes delicious sexual situations which may appeal to even the most purient readers. Oh.. to struggle against the ropes, to wonder when the captor will return, to delight in the wonders of sharing the struggle with others with these unusual proclivities - the reader will sure to be captured with a well-written story full of lovey English humor and kinky British escapades. One cannot help but take the book to a private place and fantasize"
2,skewed,"I really wanted to like this documentary much more but it in the end it just felt like an advertisement for charter schools. I think that the entire education system in the US could benefit from some meaningful reforms (better curriculum, longer school days, better ways to get rid of or retrain poorly performing teachers), but I don't think handing out vouchers, which often do not even cover the entire tuition amount, are the answer."
5,Wish More People Would Watch This!,"This film shows a part of what has gone wrong with our education system and what our ""educators"" have had to do with its decline. Good teachers should be revered, but unfortunately, the bad teachers are protected and continue to ride the gravy train."
3,Told to use this for cancer,"My problem may be that I have never had a yoga class. I have cancer and my naturopath suggested a gentle yoga tape to get me moving. I don't get how to learn a pose if you are facing away from the TV. I had a hard time taking it serious when I'm told to push down on the ground, and stretch up to the sky with my head. The names of the poses really cracked me up. The people on the tape are quite overweight, which surprised me. But bottom line for me was it was just too painful in the cancer areas. My daughter tells me taking a class makes all the difference in the world"
5,Sensationally colorful coffee table collectable!,"This is a book with page after page of an area in France I love. It is a place I want to visit time and time again. I can almost smell the intoxicating lavender breeze as I glance at the cover.If you purchase this book as a gift, I highly recommend enclosing something that has the scent of lavender. A soap or even a drop of lavender oil on the inside cover will make this a sensory experience.While I love books filled with recipes, I could not resist this one. Oh, to be in France at this moment sitting by a lavender field. This book truly brought back memories of my trip to France and I enjoyed the information on olives as I had purchased olive oil and olives at a little sea side store in Cassis. You will be looking into plane tickets soon after reading about the rich culinary heritage of this region.~The Rebecca Review"
3,Not getting the results the others got,"This product has not worked well for me. I guess it works well if you hand wash your dishes before putting them in the dishwasher. I was very surprised to find that it had left finger prints and lip prints on my glasses! And this is in a brand new compact dishwasher. That means this dishwasher is smaller than usual so the product should have been more than enough to thoroughly clean my dishes. I even tried using 2 of the tablets and found instead that that Trader Joe's Automatic Dishwasher Detergent cleans better than this.On the plus side, it smells pretty.Of course I wouldn't mind my laundry smelling pretty. But I want my dishes CLEAN.I read elsewhere that Ecover have been redesigning many of their products. I do not know if this is because of the kinds of problems I have had (read my review of their laundry powder) or if this is the new, improved product. In any case, I threw away a lot of money on this 5-pack."
4,"Lazy Susan Bearings 3""","I have not yet used the product. However, I have used a bigger one and it is working very well so I have no doubt that this will too. I do regret not ordering the bigger size but I will do so next time."
3,"There were some helpful moments, but not what I was looking for","There were some segments that were helpful. I enjoyed the 20-minute core focus and hip openers. I wasn't able to get anything from the 45-Minute Fun Flow and didn't find it at all fun. It was very difficult for me to follow. Even though a few of the sections were okay, this one just fell short for me. Just not my cup of tea."
4,good cheap brush,"I used to get my brushes at Radio Shack, but they've discontinued them. This seems like a perfectly nice substitute. Of course, it would be nice if it were refillable, but at this price point that's not an option.Mechanism works smoothly, brush feels solid, price and delivery were as promised."
2,disappointing...,"i loved their live show and highly recommend seeing them, but this CD sounds nothing like it. i'll be waiting for their next album..."
1,Not authentic sweatshirt.,"The ad said this was an authentic OU sweatshrit. It si not crimson red, it is Nebraska barn red. I bought this as a gift for my cousin but I am not giving it to her."
1,GROSS!!,"Ok so I bought this last week thinking ""hey they look like yummy jellos"" but when it came in the mail it was everything but yummy. The strawberry tasted like rubber and the lime tasted bitter. I am so dissapointed, I was even thinking of serving them at the office party next month but no my plans are ruined."
3,DW 331 K Disappointed,First let me say that I have many DeWalt tools and until now been very happy with them. However this DeWalt DW331K is a piece of Junk! The blade falls out no matter what material your trying to cut. This is very frustating and unnerving also the cheap plastic guide also falls out as soon as the saw starts rendering it useless. I for one cannot understand what DeWalt could have been thinking marketing this tool. I'm sending it back to Amazon today for a refund. Do yourself a favor and look into a Milwaukee or Bosch for a quality Jig Saw.
4,"Powerful saw, some probelms with blade retention","I've been using the DW331K for about a year. It cuts through 1"" oak like butter. Sometimes the blade pops out when I push hard on it. I then carefully reinsert the blade and mess with the blade latching mechanism to make sure that it's engaged properly. I can tell it's engaged when it no longer comes out easily when I pull on it. After I get the blade holder mechanism engaged properly, it works flawlessly.I love the variable speed feature and I'm really happy with the quality of the cut and it's got tons of power. I don't need to pull out my circular saw as much since this cuts almost as fast.I would still buy this saw again, over the others."
1,Raunchy Plus,"I bought this for one piece, Sail Away. I had no idea it was so gratuitously raunchy. Got what I paid for. Prompt shipment."
5,"Great music, not just because it's South Park.","I'm mostly a rock and punk guy, and this music doesn't conform to that, but it's great music none the less. I liked most everything by Isaac Hays, there's lots of little tidbits on here that are decent to hear, but when you really pay attention to the lyrics become great. It was worth the dollar I paid for it and then some."
2,Product description could have been more clear.,"It is not apparent from the product description that this is not the complete collection of Hanon, but only the initial exercises. The advertising needs to be more clear that this is not the entire book."
4,Some rare moments,"This anthology has a couple of rare clips that make it worth having. We have Maya Plisetskaya in the Black Swan, Ekaterina Maximova and Vladimir Vasiliev in an early version of the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet and, the real treasure, a very rare film of Tanaquil LeClercq and Jacques d'Amboise (New York City Ballet, 1955) in a TV version of Afternoon of a Faun. These three clips make it worth the price. Most of the others have been included in other ballet anthologies."
4,Wonderful book,"I did not know a great deal about Edison before reading this book and this served as a fascinating introduction. After visiting Edison's lab in West Orange, N.J. I became intrigued with him and wanted to learn more. Israel's book served as the perfect introduction to this complex and fascinating genius.I emjoyed the fact that Israel divided the biography between Edison's professional scientific life and his complicated and sometimes bizarre private life, with strained relationships with his children and two marriages. Despite the fact Edison left much to be desired as a father, one almost feels sorry for him. Apparently his towering intellect made it difficult for him to connect emotionally with the more ""plebian"" sorts of people (which was everyone else on the planet). His sons struggled under the mighty shadow their father cast.I highly recommend this book for anyone with a casual or serious insterest in the Wizard of Menlo Park."
5,A fan of J Franco,"First off, I'm mad beacuse I just heard a new special edition of Vampyros Lesbos and She Killed in Ecstacy are comming out in October, which will probably be better than the out of print synapse dvd we all have. Anyway, if you like soft core movies, vampire movies, psychadelic sountracks and scores, funky cool heavenly sets, constant zoom shots, movies that on first viewing dont make much sense, then watch this one with friends. If you are a fan of the director i dont think you would be reading this, but if you are a newbie and are doing some reasearch to know with what movie of his to start with, this will definitely do. Be aware that like probalby 100% of people who watch this movie for the first time, you will be mesmerized and will fall in love with the beautiful Soledad Miranda."
3,Finished product is good,"Well, this definately was a bit more labor intensive to put together than planned. The redwood color is more of an adobie than anything close to a red. The legs to the benches come attached (groups of 4) and need to be sepperated with a pretty sharp knife. That added about 45 min- an hour in the put together time. It took a bit of struggle to get the table bases and table top on. Since I did not have a mallot like they show in the picture directions I covered the table with a thick towel and used a hammer. It is also pretty light weight. They reccomend filling the table base with sand or water. I was hoping the table itself would be heavier and not require the legs to be filled."
5,BOYZ II MEN SONG STANDS OUT AS PERFECT ON CD.,THE SONG BY BOYZ II MEN IS A BEAUTIFUL SONG. THERE VOICES WERE MADE FOR THIS TYPE OF MUSIC. I STRONGLY SUGGEST PEOPLE RUSH OUT AND PURCHASE THIS MUSIC. IT REALLY IS INSPIRATIONAL.
2,Not what you thought it was,This is more of a gospel album. 3 sections of the CD songs have so much discord that I race across the house just to turn it to another selection. I was expecting more of the great music that was in the movie. I was disappointed. The content I got instead was a CD I would rather trade in for something else. Shame on the promoters for selling a product that is not what it was billed to be.
3,"Black gospel was needed, but cumbersome","I really liked the dc Talk re-do of the Rich Mullins song ""My Deliverer"". It gives me goosebumps almost everytime I listen to it, and I've owned it for quite a while. Jars of Clay and Carman weren't bad either. I enjoed them too."
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring","Boring, Boring, Boring, book! This book was awful! The book was way too discriptive. It took the writer a whole page to say something it could have taken a few sentences to say. I found myself skipping paragraphs to just find out what the point was. The plot was thin and predictable. One reviewer said it could have been written for young teens and I agree. I am not even sure why I bothered to finish the book.Terrible! Don't waste your money, if you must read it borrow from a friend or go to the library."
1,What would George and Ira say?,"Love the Gershwins and Cole Porter. Love Cary Grant and Bette Davis. Hated this book for its improbable plot, annoying heroine and witty, chipper preppiness. All the substance of a frappacino. So this is chick lit? Holy #####, ladies, go re-read Pride and Prejudice."
3,"Beginning Dragged, Picked up at the middle/end",A little boring in the beginning but then it picked up. I'd still recommend it. Very cute!
5,Not your Regular Romance - by any means!,"That this was a first novel promises readers will have expectations of more and more exciting and heart-felt tales from this new author. Without giving the plot away, just know that it will not have the same results when you read familiar twists and turns that you have been able to predict before. Excellent read - brilliantly executed. I loved that she was able to show her advanced vocabulary and grammatical knowledge through her heroine. Of course I am anticipating Marisa De los Santos' next book!"
1,Ugh!,"I, too, wanted to like this book, but from the first chapter, when Cornelia kept telling me what I was thinking, I was nauseated (she didn't pick up on that one). I can't stand this style of writing. I loved the first few chapters about Clare, they were well written and believable. I was really looking forward to finding out what happens to this little girl who is stuck in a horrible siutation. But the book quickly heads downhill when Cornelia and Clare meet. Everyone is just so witty and smart - including 11-year-old Clare. Come on. Her mentally ill mother abandons her on the side of the road, and 24-hours later, she's yucking it up with the Teo and Linny at the coffee shop. I couldn't read another page."
3,Nothing to write home about.,"While the story itself was alright, the characters were so unbelievable it was hard to get through. Cornelia's constant movie references were annoying and at only 11 years old, Clare was a little too knowledgable. I don't think Clare's mother's breakdown was fully justified and her father was just so blah. As for Teo, give me a break!"
4,Marisa de los Santos,"This was a very good first novel for this magnificent poet. ""Love Walked In"" has introduced us to the talent, the insight and the use of the English language that not many authors attain. Read her next two novels which each, in their own way, far surpass Marisa's first attempt."
1,This book can be summed up in one word:,BORING!I have struggled through 200 pages and I am just going to call it.Time of death 4:28PM.I can NOT finish this book.
1,So boring I couldn't get past the 2nd chapter.,"Ironic (or maybe not) that one of the previous reviewers grabbed this book off the ""bargain rack."" That's about where I think it belongs. So dull and the endless references to old movies and actors was completely off-putting. I'm glad I didn't buy it and got it FREE from the library. I'll be returning it pronto."
4,Beautifully written,"The first few chapters of this book were a little slow for me but I was quickly drawn into the characters. The author has a stunning way with wordplay. It is almost breathtaking and I was captivated with her writing. This is an excellent read and I'm looking forward to her second novel ""Belong To Me"" which takes off where this one ended. This author has the key to writing characters that you can empathize with even through their inadequacies."
3,Fresh,I enjoyed this book as some light summer reading (even though it takes place in the winter). The characters were likeable and the writing is fresh--sprinkled with literary and cinematic references. And I appreciated that finally a 30-something living a fairly self-involved existence learns to truly love someone else.
3,"Good plot points, not so much for the characters","I liked this book, but I wanted more from it. The characters felt... plastic? At times my heart just screamed for them and the situations they were in, but the characters themselves... it was an odd read for me in that respect. The writing and the situations were wonderful, but the characters felt hollow and, well, made up. Yes, it's a fiction book, but I like to forget that while I'm reading.It's definitely worth a read and might make a good Summer read for a book club. There was a lot of different issues you could talk about, just ignore the characters - they needed something more..."
2,"Bumpy on both sides, not held together very well - better off going to Chinatown","Sushi rollers are pretty cheap in general, but I was too lazy to go to Chinatown and pick one up so I thought I'd try my luck online. I was surprised that the roller is bumpy on both sides, and the string holding it together is very loose. I've made sushi before on better rollers of the same price, decided to go to chinatown to pick one up instead.That said it's not unusable, but you need to put a layer of cling wrap on the roller if you don't wanna get sushi rice stuck between the bamboo. Also you won't get very tight rolls, but with a little practice it'll work.In general I was pretty disappointed, probably will just give this away."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"GREAT PRODUCT, SPEEDY DELIVERY. I WILL DEFINITELY DO BUSINESS WITH THIS SELLER AGAIN IN THE FUTURE."
5,Must have!,"Noriko Ogiwara creates riddles which seem unavoidable. And they are. However, like the words of any oracle, they are open to *very* interesting and unexpected interpretations.Don't debate. Buy this book! Thank yourself later."
3,Magic lost in translation?,"This book has some awesome and brilliant moments, classic moments of heroism and romance but I felt that the flow of the book was disturbed by its translation into english. I sensed the greatness but the prose did not convey it.It's worth a read nonetheless just don't expect to enjoy a reread. Once you're done, you will probably put it down and relive the great moments in your head rather than in the prose itself. This book makes me wish I could read japanese."
1,Not a good version !,"A DVD version of this film is first Published of the china ""qiaojiaoren"" DVD company in 2006.They are two versions of the same poor .Let me disappointed ."
3,Reasonably informative without much technical info,"This book, like practically all Dover science books, is a reprinted old book that does not incorporate any of the recent research in acoustics. For example, much research on acoustics as related to the design of a theatre is not in here. However, if you have a good grasp of fundamental physics (say, you took some good college physics classes but it has been quite a few years back), and now you just want to see how the physics you learned apply to the making of musical instruments, this book provides a nice overview."
4,"Light on physics formalism, yet concise intro","I agree with others on how the lack of formal exposition of the concepts renders this work a little heavy on the verbiage. Of course, it depends on the reader's taste too. I'm used to seeing acoustics presented more formally.Nevertheless, Benade's book has been around for a while and it's considered a classic. The writing style is unambiguous, but it does tend to get a little long. It may appeal more to artists than scientists. Lots of information, overall pleasant read, very interesting, and you will get more of the feel of things than in an acoustics course from a physics perspective.This book really fills a gap between the mathematics and fundamental musical acoustics concepts."
3,No opinion,Bought this book when I was starting to get into building my own drum set and then never really had the time to as life just got in the way.
3,slow start good finish,"Having read several of Mercedes Lackey's books I expected a little more. I found that there was a strong introduction but the body of the book lacked it's usual appeal. The conclusion did leave the reader wanting more. If you are a Mercedes Lackey fan, read and judge for yourself."
5,One of the Best Valdemarran Sequels,"Mercedes Lackey can really make fictions close to reality, You'll never stop looking for Valdemar sequels after this."
3,It's...Okay,"I read all three books in this series, and Skif's...uh...'emotions' were akin to one such as a uncastrated dog who smells a female in heat. That was very irritating considering he did this two or three times before giving up.Gwena irritated me more then Elspeth personally, and the gryphons were highly likeable. The Tayledras and Shin'a'In were very interesting cultures and Mornelithe Falconsbane was a very hate-able evil guy.I agree with what someone said about the 'crash course' so-to-speak of becoming an Adept, that it should have taken her much longer, and the meet-Darkwind-who-automatically-likes-her thing was very stereotypical as well."
2,Bad series,"Not the best of books. This book is kind of disapointing because it feels like one big foreword. It has a very slow beginning and middle. This book recycles characters that were first introduced in the Arrows series. The character development is weaker in this series and this book is very drawn out which makes for a boring read. If you just want to read this book because you liked the series based around Talia then don't. Trust me, by the time it's over you'll wish you had just left off after the first series."
3,Kindle edition has errors everywhere!,"3 stars for the Kindle edition in particular (I'd actually give the book 5 stars and I love Mercedes Lackey). This edition has misspelled words and odd spaces everywhere and it's seriously detracting from the reading experience. Purchased on 11/19/12, hopefully they fix the errors at some point, because it's a shame to have such fun writing dragged down by typographical errors."
2,Great research BUT...,"What horrible writing. Never (well almost never) have I read a biography with such a facinating subject, with such in-depth research, more boringly presented.The writing is terrible. The subject, a man of many layers living in arguably the most morally testing time of the 20th century, just lays there on the page, fact after fact, and never comes alive. Getting through this book was some chore, and that's from someone who really WANTED to read this book. I have to agree with the professional reviewer who used the word, ""maddening"" to describe the writing here. Really, the author's editor should be taken off the job, but the author is certainly no great shakes as a writer and deserves his lumps also. Not recommended, except to those who really want to plow through a pile of chaff to get to the wheat."
2,"Great idea, but not practical","My rating of this book has less to do with content that with its structure. The idea of having a water-resistant book at the beach is great. But you should be aware that it is HEAVY. Although it is about the size of a regular paperback, it is much heavier - not the kind of book that you can hold in one hand.For that reason alone, I wouldn't recommend buying it."
2,"Ok, but the new Zumba is much better!",This is the older version of Zumba Advanced. The New version is much better. In this old version is ok but you get much less music and a much shorter dvd. You should definitely go for the Newer Advanced Zumba (green cover) It is worth it.
3,overrated,"I relied on the positive reviews on Amazon and purchased this product for my granddaughter. I personally was disappointed, as there are only 8 birds included in the book. However, I will say that my grandaughter seems to enjoy the book (I wouldn't say she ""loves"" it) and a few of the birds like the Killdeer and Spotted Towhee are not common to youngsters so, it does provide a tiny bit of educational value."
2,Poor Quality,I have purchased several of these mattress covers and have always been very pleased - however this particular pad was not up to previous quality- the elastic that would normally go around the mattress was like paper and it torn off - I did not return it because we needed it immediately and just put it under the sheet =hopefully no one else has this issue
1,Poor Quality,Item ripped in all 4 corners when i put it on the bed. Item is nice but the seams on the side are like paper
1,Do not buy this...you will be disappointed,"The product looked good and why not it's just a mattress cover. The problem with this cover is that the sides that hold it in place are made from some sort of material that is either defective, rotten or just poorly chosen. I now own a mattress cover that is torn on three of the four corners and will no longer stay in place. The bottom hem of the sides is still there and there is nothing wrong with the quilted top, but the material that is supposed to go around the outside of the mattress is shredded."
2,Junk,"Skirt is paper thin. Tore the first time I touched it. You would think that with all the materials available that don't tear easily, it would not have been hard to come up with a better product."
2,Crappy Quality!,"After doing a lot of research, I ended up buying this mattress pad based on the relatively good reviews. I have purchased several mattress pads over the years at local stores and was always disappointed by the durability of the material, and/or the lousy fit that they had on my pillow-top mattress; quite frankly, I just wanted a decent mattress pad that would hold up since there are many more fun & interesting things I'd rather spend money on!Though I measured my mattress to make sure that it would fit its depth properly, this pad (like all the others) slips off constantly, which drives me insane. Also, I have only owned this product for less than 2 months, yet recently found a huge tear in the side of it which seems to have happened when I made the bed. Durability FAIL.It is, however, very comfortable, so maybe it would work and hold up better with a regular, less deep mattress??"
5,Great mattress pad,Just what I was looking for. I wanted a mattress cover and this is nice good quality even a little pillowy which I wasn't expecting.. It's perfect.
1,POOR QUALITY,I WAS SO EXCITED WHEN I FIRST LOOKED AT THE MATTRESS PAD. THE TOP WAS PLUSH AND SOFT. BUT WHEN I REMOVED IT THE SKIRT WAS COMING UNSTITCHED. THE WHOLE THING WAS UNRAVELING. I'LL GET ANOTHER BRAND.
2,"looks nice, poor quality","When I pulled fabric down over mattress, it ripped on one side half way across fabric. Fabric too thin for pad cover."
1,Don't Waste your money,"I purchased this item based on all the positive reviews. After getting the pad and installing it on my bed I was initially impressed with the look and feel. Shortly after that, within the first week, the expandable side webbing began to split and separate when adjusting in the morning. The expanding material that forms the sides of the cover seems almost brittle/fragile. I would not recommend this cover because of the issues with the construction of the sides on the cover."
1,It's going back,I bought this product and am returning it as soon as I can get it back into the box.I tried to make toast this morning and only one corner of the bread toasted and burned. The back and more than half of the bread did not toast at all.I am going to look for a non-convection type toaster - the good old coils seemed to work better.
2,OSTER 4 SLICE TOASTER OVEN,PACKAGE ARRIVED QUICKLY.OVEN LOOKS REALLY NICE.OVEN BURNS TOAST EVEN ON LOWEST SETTINGS!!
2,Item arrived late and packaging was a joke!,Placed the order for this item and really looking forward to using it. I have the IBM Lenovo T-60 laptop and my existing docking station only had VGA output so was looking forward to having a DVI output. Did not expect that someone would do such a poor job of just throwing the docking station in a box with a couple of plastic air pillows and hope for the best. What was this vendor thinking? Transport these days is brutal and handling from either the UPS or FEDEX or the USPS is like having gorillas throw stuff around... you need to pack properly! I returned the item after seeing the key bent inhalf in the dock port lock. Did not even bother to take it out of the plactic wrap. Big disappointment.
4,Well done Lenovo,"I would have given this 5 stars but it only comes with 1 ps2 port and my keyboard and mouse both need one so I knocked it down a peg because there's all kind of ports I don't use, it would have been nice to have one that I do use. Really though, it's a well made unit and I have no complaints thus far. It's a big time saver without having to unplug cords from the unit and if you don't need the add-on cd drive it's a much better value then the full size dock."
1,it did not fit,I ordered this part to replace a broken one. it did not fit and was a waste of my money. next time Ill buy one at the auto parts store.
4,Auto Ventshade 92754 Ventvisor,Very good quality item & easy to install. Allows me to keep my windows cracked open to let hot air escape & adds a nice look to my F150. Great bang for the buck!
2,Almost perfect,Very pleased with look and ease of assembly. The problem I had was getting a good paw print. I followed the directions but the molding stuck to the bottom of both my dogs paws. It is a real mess to get it out of their hair and made a very poor print. I eventually had to put plastic wrap over the molding first but the print is not very detailed. Will purchase a different kind of molding material for the paw moldings. The rest of the product was perfect and if molding came out would rate 5 stars.
5,reading with daughter,"I bought for 9 yr old daughter & we are reading together. Answers alot of her questions, we read about a chapter a night. Is helping her understand what is to come ... i like the questions at the end it helps me to understand whats on her mind."
4,The Body Book: It's a God Thing! (The Lily Series),"Overall this was a great book to go over with my 9 year old daughter just before she started fourth grade. I loved the Christian perspective and my daughter loved the little quizzes. One thing I didn't like was that it assumes the reader already knows what a period is right from the beginning. Even in the period chapter, it assumes you know what is involved. This book was the first time my daughter became aware that a period was more than a dot at the end of the sentence. I would have preferred that it started out with an explanation of what a period was instead of expecting that she already is aware and that she has negative feelings about it."
2,The Good Bad & Ugly,"The Good is the beautiful color images the ZR800 can capture. Wow. Very nice, very impressive.The bad is the cheap construction. I felt like one slip and this thing might end up in 100 pieces.The UGLY is what caused me to return the ZR800. The high pitched whining of the motor is impossible to miss on the audio. Shame on Canon for releasing a product with such poor audio."
4,worth what I paid for it,"I am quite happy with this camcorder, I think the 35x optical zoom plus the tremendous digital zoom is a bit of over kill though. I set the overall zoom to 100x and even that is too much unless you use a tripod and of course the way I want to use it, a tripod just doesn't work. I love the great picture, especially the wide angle. viewing with the included composite video cable just doesn't do it justice though, plan on using a fire wire cable and transfer video's to a computer. Then you can burn your videos to a DVD to view on a TV if you wish. That way you get the best pic your TV is capable of showing."
4,ZR800,Canon ZR800 MiniDV Camcorder with 35x Optical ZoomThe camera is easy to use. The battery requires no separate charger which is very convenient. The image quality is excellent.
3,Grrr...Well?,This came in a ziplock back of 6 candy bars. I was very unsatisfied with how many I got but on the other side the candy itself is SLAMMING!!!!!!!!!!
1,"tastes bad, tastes stale, obsolete inventory?","1) these candy bars were apparently made for overseas distribution but never got there. I ordered from a company in Mass. figuring that all the reviews talking about candy with asian/indian language on the wrapper might be avoided but it was not. Seems you will get these ""overseas"" bars wherever you get them from.2) I wanted the VIOLET CRUMBLE but it is not available in the US anymore. Some reviewed these and said these bars were close to if not better than the VC. I disagree greatly. Although they are both a form of ""sponge"" candy with a chocolate covering, this bar does not come close to the VIOLET CRUBMLE. The ""sponge"" center only makes me think the word STALE, and the chocolate has something wrong with it. Not even close to the quality of the chocolate used on the VC. Indeed after just a small sampling from the first bar, I was so disappointed I tossed them all in the garbage.Too bad. Guess I'll keep on looking for the VC. Hail Flavius!"
3,Lord Darnley,"Oh Alison...maybe it's because the topic isn't quite as exciting as the War of the Roses; maybe it's because Mary isn't as interesting as Eleanor or Elizabeth; whatever it is, this isn't my favorite Alison Weir bio. By the time I got to the middle of the book, I just wanted Darnley dead and Mary to get a grip. I couldn't care less what happened. Which is a shame, because Alison normally writes fantastically well and keeps things interesting. oh well, luckily for bio and Alison fans, there are other books."
3,Kindle version overpriced,"Would have purchased despite negative reviews based on sample and my feminist point of view. however...publisher should not price all Weir books equally prime. Older, lamer stuff should fairly be under 9.99. Prefer to suport local library or used bookshop."
2,Not as good as others,I have about nine translations of The Dhammapada.I find this translation flat and uninspired compared to most of the others in my collection that are available through Amazon.
3,"Inside good, outside not what I had hoped...","Book was described as 'used very good'. While the pages and inside are fine, the description did not reveal that the cover has 5 stickers all over it, including one covering the library bar code. Doesn't quite make the nice gift item I had hoped.Not sure what I'm going to do with it."
2,The first real chink in the armor,"After an incredible string of albums that few contemporary artists can match (VERY few - Prince and the Beatles are the only ones that come to mind), this soundtrack was Stevie's first major stumble. Packed with a lot of tepid filler, there are only occasional glimpses of the genius here - most notably in ""Love's Light in Flight,"" which at least has a strong melody and soaring arrangement. Decide for yourself what you think of the ubiquitous ""I Just Called"" - it's total schmaltz in my book. And ""Don't Drive Drunk"" is a mockery of the kind of socially conscious, political song that Stevie handled so well in the 70s.Unfortunately, this album proved to be not so much a misstep as preview of things to come: Wonder has yet to regain the glory of his heyday. But his other 80s efforts (In Square Circle and Characters), though spotty, are better than this."
5,It only gets better ...,"Hanson never seems to stop amazing me. Anyone who has ever doubted them as a band, performancewise, should check this DVD out. Although, nothing compares to actually seeing them play live, this DVD almost puts you there again.I went to the acoustic show last August, and it was amazing. Being in a smaller venue, it was more ""personal"" and ""intimate"" as Hanson put it. Most recently I took my sister with me to see them in Anaheim this October, and she loved it. In her words, ""the way they play, you can see that they just love what they do, they dont just PLAY, they make you FEEL everything they play, and the music is so real."" So, I do reccommend this DVD if you are a fan, and even if you are not. :)A song can define any emotion, and watching Hanson play, or any good band for that matter is well worth it."
2,Bllack Tabio Socks,They were too bulky in the toe to look or be comfortoble. would not buy them again. the toe was sguare and did not look good.
3,meh,"The seller was great. The book itself was a bit bland, but there was some useful information. Also this book has a lot of discriptions rather then info."
5,wonderful for kids,"I remember a door-to-door salesman coming by our house when I was little and my parents buying the entire set for me. I read all 15 books and had a period where each volume was my favorite. I referenced the animal volumes, weather, and science ones throughout elementary school for my projects and reports. The pictures are lovely and the text is very easy to read. We gave away our set to my little cousins, and sometimes I want to go steal them back. I'd love for my future kids to have books like these."
4,Captivating study of homosexuality and transsexuality,"This book has caused quite a stir as the reviews below suggest. The subject matter is controversial, and the author's approach--first-hand accounts and summaries of the literature--will not appeal to everyone. Despite a reliance on secondary sources, Bailey breaks new ground in this unusually lucid review of the causes of male homosexuality and transsexuality. Most arresting is his claim that there are two types of transsexuality, one related to homosexuality, the other totally different and caused by male identification with the female form. He concludes that both types of transsexuals are rooted in biology.The book should be of interest to therapists who treat transsexuals, as well as preoperative and postoperative transsexuals seeking more information. There is also a helpful ""how-to"" section on the transition process from male to ""female,"" including surgery, hormones, etc."
4,The saga begins,"After spending time in Florida rubbing shoulders with the Morbid Angel and Cannibal Corpse boys, guitarist Aaron Butler has returned to the shores of Australia with a vision. Piecing together a very tight group of Melbourne musos, Aaron has created one of the finest grind/death albums to come out of the Australian scene since Blood Dusters Fisting The Dead.The guitars are fast, the drumming a cranked up drum machine, and the singing a throaty mess, and by god I love it. The basic album, minus the dodgy live tracks added for the re-issue, is an Aus metal classic. The title track lurching from the ranks and setting an appropriate precedent for the rest of the album. Think along the lines of early Carcass, Napalm Death and Damaged. Twisted and glorious, but be sure to check out the follow up, Loopholes and Great Excuses. A fine beginning to hopefully a long legacy."
4,Family Favorite,We've been using Citris Mint shampoo and conditioner for a couple of years. Great fragrance and leaves your hair feeling clean and conditioned.
4,An OBE Primer,"Albert Taylor's Soul Traveler is a light read - it's short and doesn't really go in depth much. Nonetheless it's an enjoyable read of one man's experiences with out of body travel. If you are familiar with OBE this book won't really offer any new insights. I was a bit surprised the book is so short... I think it would have been more interesting if Taylor had detailed his experiences more thoroughly, including how the part of his life that concerned OBE interfaced with his life of a NASA scientist. Or his personal and family life. He mentions his wife many times, but never her reaction to his night time adventures. A more fully fleshed out story and book would have been more interesting to read. As it is, this is like a primer on OBE - okay for what it is, but without much impact once you close the last page."
5,My own quest,"I have been soul traveling since I was a little girl only I had no name for it. They never scared me but they were a little unnerving because no one else I knew understood or believed in them. Mr. Taylor's book made me feel more assured in my travels and perhaps even vindicated in my quest. I have used it to great success and have loaned it to a friend whose daughter seems to be experiencing characteristics similar to soul travel. I thank Dr. Taylor for making this easy to read, humorous and not overwhelming and frightening."
1,It reads like a 1972 High School Year Book,"I'm not typically one to complain, and it seems silly to think that a book about a historical war machine could be called 'dated', but that is what this is. The format of this book appears to be result of Polaroid snapshots with typewritten captions, taped together and photocopied. I can respect the work and effort involved in the projects that are documented, but the resolution of the drawings are so poor they rendered useless. The is very little to be gained from the purchase of this book."
5,Great Soap for adults and children,"The whole family uses this product and we have had no complaints, even from the children. It pleasant smelling and leaves the skin feeling clean but not dry."
4,An Interesting Perspective on Issues with Eating,"This book was recommended to me by a nutritionist. Since I liked her approach to nutrition counseling, I ordered and read the book. I could relate to it in many ways, and read it quickly, yet thoroughly. Although some of the analogies were too focused on classic eating disorders such as anorexia and bulemia, for me to relate to as an overeater, overall, I still rate the book highly. In fact, so much so, that I have become a patient of one of the authors."
5,This is the SECOND edition,"I just got this book, so I can't review it yet. But I wanted to clarify that this is the 2nd edition even though it's not in the title. What confused me is that the Kindle version has '2nd Edition' in the title, but you can't buy it in paperback from that page. So I bought this one thinking that it was the 1st edition b/c I can't find the 2nd edition in paperback anywhere on this website. Now that I have the book, I see that it was written in 2003 and the 1st edition was written in 1995."
4,Mike Patton excellence,Definately some of Mike Patton's best work this side of Epic. I highly recommend this CD to those that like mixed work CD's and explorations of technique and electronica. For the price this CD really can't be beat.
5,This beat could win me Grammy,"The story of Patton's life -- ultimately, more talented than any one of the artists whose albums were hanging on the #102 - #1 slots on Billboard's Top 200 List, when Peeping Tom debuted at #103 --- but do you think that bothers him?If you've heard people talking about this guy but have never taken the time to check out one of his projects, might at well start here.The worm goes slow but he does go, right?"
4,"Nice, different!","For those of you that are fans of Mike Patton or were fans of Faith No More, you'll most likely enjoy this album."
2,I agree with KLOTEN,"Let me start this out with saying I love Mike Patton. My fake ID name 15 years ago was Mike Patton (not Michael Patton). I was really excited to hear about this album. I love Amon Tobin's work too, but I don't really see his style come through here at all. This comes accross as a collection of Patton B-sides never intended for release and given to a bunch of hip hop/electronic stars to try and make it sound good. The lyrics aren't interesting either. As a Patton fan, I will never be able to avoid listening to something new of his. Also as an artist, I can understand that creating something, whether it may be bad or good, starts as an idea. Many times it is hard to move on to another idea without completing one first. You gotta hand it to the guy for having so many successes with so many unique ideas. I am surprised he hasn't had a miss before now."
3,Should you Buy This Camera? The Answer Contained Within...,"Okay, I have been going back and forth for 6 months. So, should I get Sony, Canon, one of the other manufactures... Some people say Sony's are terrible, other say Canon's are good but terrible in low light. All say things about both manufacturers and loud noise heard over the mic... So, what is a guy like me, adicted to reading reviews before making purchases to do?Well, I was to wait and tonight I found that Canon announced 3 new XR models; ZR80, ZR85 & ZR90. All basically the same price as these and it appears they fixed the low-light problems. Of course I will wait until they are availible next month and I get to read more reviews; and so should you. I never buy any electronics in January since most new electronics come out by March. I just wanted to give all you nutty review-adicts (like myself) a heads-up."
1,Canon ZR45 mc Mfg Defect,"I presently own the Canon ZR45 MC and have had a problem with it not accepting the cassette. When I place a cassette in the tray and close the door, I get a message to ""remove the cassette"".It appears that a lot of this model camera has that problem and I wouldn't recommend buying one unless you can get some type of extended guarentee from the manufacturer. As a matter of fact, if I were you I would send a e-mail to Canon to see how they would adress this issue if you did have the problem later on.SteveKJR"
5,Simply outstnding,"Do not be misled by the title. Hart provides the most sensible and satisfactory logic on the role of God in creating and disposing of tragedy. He disposes of Mackie's famous ""if God is indeed omnipotent, he manifestly is not good, and if he is good he manifestly is not omnipotent. En route he deals with Voltaire, Dostoevsky, Calvin, fundamentalists, original sin and many other ideas. I have read it twice and I will go back to learn even more. Not a hard read but you must pay attention."
4,The only knife holder that worked,This was the only knife holder I could find that would fit on the side of an upper kitchen wall cabinet. It is nicer looking in person and the price was great. The magnets are not super strong and the knives kind of 'slip' into place when you first place them onto the holder. I was a little nervous about that but they stay up and I don't think they would slide off. I guess it's better than the magnets that make it difficult to pull the knives off. I would've like the solid strip but they are only sold in larger sizes. I think the size of this holder makes it versatile for using in the kitchen. Pleased with my purchase!
3,adequate,"i selected this knife holder purely because of it's size. i needed something 11' or less. however, as other reviewers have pointed out, the knives do not lie flush to the magnets and therefore the ""grip"" is not extremely strong...just adequate. it is against an out of the way spot and i pay attention when i place the knives, so it is fine...secure enough."
1,Weak magnets - is dangerous,"This knife holder is dangerous. Three times when I was taking one knife off of it, I bumped another knife and it fell off - lucky I didn't slash my hand. So I ordered the NorPro 12 inch and it has good strong magnets."
3,"Serviceable, with a flaw","I needed a 10"" knife holder to fit on the side of an upper cabinet in the kitchen, and this one was the only 10"" I found on Amazon, so I gave it a try. It is as others have described--the magnetic strips don't lay flat, and in fact are skewed in three dimensions! It was a bit disheartening to see, considering its high price in relation to longer, nicer-looking holders out there. But it's a utilitarian object to me--so although the magnets don't contact the blades perfectly, they do well enough to hold my large Henckels chef's knives with no problem. My slicer and boning knives don't seem to hold as well, but the steel is different and there's just less metal to contact the magnets; they don't feel like they're going to fall off when tested. All in all, the holder suits my needs okay and I'd probably buy it again--I just wish it was made to better tolerances."
5,Best cake pan I've ever used,"No more oiling and flouring cake pans!My specialty cake is a very rich, dense chocolate, and it sticks like nobody's business to metal and glass pans - but pops right out of these!I love that these pans have ""handles"" on the sides, a lot of silicon pans don't have that, and I end up sticking my hot mitt into whatever I'm baking getting it out of the oven.I've used silicon for years and never had a problem with uneven baking like the negative reviewer here - have to wonder whether that was just a fluke/user error. :)"
1,Awful!,"This book is absolutely awful to say the least...yes, it does cover several topics but the ability of these authors to make even the simplest problems seem complicated is rather uncanny in my opinion. The notation used through out the book is unique to them and there requires that you first try to decipher that before getting through what they've written - worked examples seem only to exist to complicate things further.My worst derivatives book I doubt that I'll ever be going back to it for refernce except when forced to. You could do better with Hull, Chriss or Wilmott!"
2,badly described,"The ratchet is tiny. Exactly 4"" long from socket center to end. Very little leverage. Description does not mention what size drive it is. Picture makes it look like a 3/8 drive, but is is only a 1/4"" drive. Be very careful with this seller. I like SK, but toolfetch? Be careful of description. Returns? 15% restocking and shipping cost both ways."
5,THE book,"This is the only anatomy book you will need, as a physician or med student, and it is beatiful to the eyes too."
3,read only if you have much time...,"This book is not primarily about eBusiness, but about the application of general management knowledge (such as customer focus etc.) in an internet - enabled world. As such it does not present new concepts for eBusiness. It merely summarizes old and well known cases and makes them fit to the own model of 5 ""elements of business design"". The book might be nice for beginners to see what is possible nowaday's but of little help if you want to learn really new concepts. Last point: the content could well be condensed to fit on 100 pages, 4 repetitions of everything are really of little use."
4,Clear and Practical,"This book is very well written and is ideal for those who want to gain an edge in profiting from the Value Chain to their maximum advantage. This book has done an excellent job in synthesizing other seminal works (Michael E. Porter's 'Competitive Advantage', Slywotzky and Morrison's 'Value Migration', 'Profit Zone', and 'Profit Patterns') and presenting the materials as a coherent systematic tool for analyzing operational supply chain problems. The case studies are well chosen and the diagrams at the end of the book are ready made summaries/checklist. The topics are based on a framework of Value Proposition, Scope, Profit Capture, Strategic Control, and Execution. This book is a must read for anyone who wants to get a practical understanding and use of the Value Chain."
1,No chain,"In the description of this item it states: ""The kit comes with 15 feet of cord/chain"". Just so you know - there is no chain. There is only white electrical cord that looks like the bit extending from the lampshade in the photo. It makes a very basic look - not decorative at all, like it would have been with the chain-covered cord."
1,No DVD Media Available,"For all the marketing and features, the mini-dvd media required to use the Sony product is not available anywhere. Sony does not tell you this; and you only learn this after some very frustrating searching. Best Buy, Circuit City, SonyStyle, and others (search the entire Internet), and you will not find it available anywhere. Thus, once you record on the single dvd-r provided with the camcorder you purchased -- you are finished, and have nothing but an $1,100 mantel piece!! I recommend looking at one of the other producers of the DVD-camcorder (Panasonic, Hitachi). I wish I had."
3,"Buy it if you have money to burn, otherwise...","I'll start off with the two pros: there is no question that this headset wrench will last me a lifetime - I can feel the quality of the metal every time I use it. Secondly, it does save time working on older bikes as a simple wrench like this can easily tighten and loosen headsets - if it doesn't fit the headset, then flip it and most likely it will fit.Its uni-tasking ability marks its true con: I only use this tool because I feel like I need to use it after wasting money on it - basically, I don't want it to go to waste. I admit, it does save time when I need to tighten my headset but I'm not in a rush to get anywhere.As the title suggests, get this tool if you have money to burn or work on bikes frequently day-in and day-out. Otherwise, the home mechanic - who does occasional bike repairs and maintenance - would be much better off with a 12 or 15-inch adjustable wrench that can be used on bottom brackets and extremely tight fittings as well."
3,Hope not fulfilled,I read these types of books alot. There is something to be gained from the book but there is better on the market.
5,Highly Recommended!!!,"This is one of the very best books I have ever read in the area of human performance. There are so many techniques covered that actually work! There is no ""fluff"" in this book. One of the things I like most about this book is that there are action steps at the end of each section. I applied many of the techniques and they really helped me out in a big way. I am much more organized and focused in my work and with my family."
5,Useful and fun,"Many talented people don't achieve all that they could because they lack one fundamental skill--the ability to focus their energies and talents.This book goes a long way toward teaching the skills necessary to focus your energies on those things that really matter to you in your life, those things that will take you where you really want to go.It is written in a very readable fashion and contains exercises you can do and strategies you can employ."
3,short on substance,"Well I read it. Thought about it. Made some notes, and actually slept on my thoughts before submitting this. To date I have thoroughly enjoyed and learned a lot from Mark Victor Hansen's work. Although there are some credible idea's in 'The Power of focus', most of the material appears to be somewhat academic,lacking in regular substance and heavily weighed towards this Les Hewitt guy in promoting his Achiever's company. With that I am disappointed. I purchased this book on Mr. Hansen's credibility and past success's of previous work. I discovered a few distinctions however the writing was not as defined, clearcut and experiential as Mr. Hansen normally comes across. Over promoted and underwritten."
3,I had much higher expectations.. basic self help book,"After reading a few of the reviews I thought this was going to be a great book. It's ok and a very basic self help book. I've read several books in the genre and all I look for when I run across additional books is one great idea to move me ahead. I can't say there was one ""a-ha"" moment which disappoints me. I did enjoy the first 100 pages or so but then it did slow down and crawl through the last 2/3. I am a fan of Jack Canfield but I think this book was influenced a bit too much by Mark Victor Hansen who is more a repetitive, rah rah, type writer. Not that that is bad, just that it gets old fast. So, as a beginning student of self help, this book might be useful... If you've read a bit on the subject, look elsewhere."
3,wrong posted info for this item,"It seems that you can not order the yellow tool box anymore. I ordered 15 of these items and when I received them, they were charcoal Grey with Black handles. Normally this would not be a problem but these were to store on site safety information and need to be highly visible. The vendor did issue a refund of the shipping charges. I think some of these adds need to be revised instead of just shipping what ever you have in stock."
5,Black Children...,"As Dr. Wilson correctly observed, ""In an oppressive society, the social institutions, of which the family is part and parcel, actually work against the oppressed."" That said, one must recognize that the oppressed mustn't employ the same methods as the oppressor for building strong families and rearing productive children. In the Developmental Psychology of the Black Child, Dr. Wilson skillfully provides Black parents with the tools needed to produce the type of children needed for further the race."
1,She should get No Stars!,"It's amazing how people have become mindless cows following a pop star with no obvious talent. Jennifer Lopez and her producers should get run down on the Grand Concourse for using one of the tightest Beatnuts beat for ""Watch Out Now"" and making it into commercial sap. Shame on them!"
2,Great stories overshadowed by poor execution.,"Very interesting insight into the world (and heads) of police detectives. Based on the information and anecdotes alone I would have given this 5 stars. However, this book is in need of a good editor. Typos abound amid very poor structure. I don't see why the author deserves any credit at all as it seems to be transcriptions from (perhaps) recorded interviews. There are no breaks between a single detective's many anecdotes, for example. I understand the subtitle is ""... In Their Own Words"", and that part is great because you'll learn some police lingo and get a real feel for each detective. These aren't seasoned authors -- they're cops likely used to writing reports, not biographical essays. I don't know who's more at fault, the ""author"" or the publisher, but this had the potential to be a great book."
5,as ordered,It was very convenient ordering these bags through Amazon because they are hard to find in the stores.
5,Searphim Shock is shockingly great music,"This band kind of snuck up on me, I had never heard of Seraphim Shock and a friend said hey you have to hear these guys. I am really glad I did. They have a brilliant use of played instruments to electronic sounds that blend together amazingly well. If you like bands like Type O Negative, then check these guys out."
4,Stories That Shine,"People who want to see the Christian faith made concrete will love these stories as well as preachers and former students of Professor Craddock. As enjoyable as the stories are, they lack the context of the sermons in which they were used not to mention the joy of hearing Professor Craddock's voice and seeing his face. But for those who know him, in our mind's eye, we can see him on that box behind the pulpit, hear his voice ringing and our souls are fed once again."
3,Great price one for time use,This is a great pack with plenty of variety. The glue sticks really well to the paper on the back of it but only lasts for one use on a person. But for the price that is fine!
3,Fun one time use,"My kids had fun with these. The adhesive often comes off but for the price hey, they had fun."
3,Mustache Review,"the mustaches came in a timely manner but they were VERY large compared to an adult's face. we had to cut a lot of them to fit and the sticky adhesive didn't stay well. the mustaches shed little black hairs all over but in the end, we had a blast so they were well worth it."
3,Lots of variety but didn't stick too well,"The Mustaches were good in that there was a lot of variety in the package but they did not stick well, so be prepared to use something additional to help them stick and make sure you have a completely dry surface to stick to. Overall they were a hit because of the different styles."
3,A little disappointed,Loved the assortment but we were missing 2 mustaches. Each mustache came on cardboard but 2 of the cardboards were empty. So I came up short for an upcoming party. Bummer! But they are cute and are large enough for adults not small children.
2,not a good battery,I DONT LIKE THIS MP3 PLAYER BECAUSE I HAVE TO PUT A NEW BATTERY IN EVERY TIME I USE THE THING.
2,Coby 2,"Bought another Coby MP3 for my older son, however wanted a 1 MG since he was younger. This was a poor quality MP3. The lighting/graphics/words are poor. I tried for hours on Christmas to download 4 songs, all the same format. Two downloaded, the other 2 kept giving me an error message. The quality of the player itself seemed plastic-like. I thought I couldn't go wrong buying a Coby, but I guess I should have read more reviews. You get what you pay for....."
2,I hoped for better,"Roughly half the space in this atlas is devoted to domestic USA maps. In purchasing the ""World Atlas"" I was looking for much more detail of the foreign nations than is provided here in the space allocated. Many cities and towns in the Middle East, for example, are not even identified."
5,Smooth Transition to Writing,"My last two of seven children have used this program... they have nicer handwriting than the other five.The repetition is necessary and very helpful. Moving into italic writing versus printing is very easy and smooth with this program. Nine years old seems like a good time to use this book.Another great plus to this program is that with just a very little guidance and oversight, the student can easily go through this book on his own."
5,One of the Elite of Star Wars,"Between all of the action, the characters from Han Solo's past, and everything else, I'd have to say that this is possibly the best Star Wars book. And I have read about all of them, too. I own all of them from The Paradise Snare to Vision of the Future with the exeption of three. This is possibly the best that Star Wars has produced and it will be hard to top with future novels."
3,The Usual Rush Around To Save The Universe,"This review covers the audio cassette book (2 tapes, 3 hours). Okay, really 3.5 stars. This audio book had so much going for it: a great start, a terrific plot buildup. Then...nothing. It became overly predictable, along with a very rapid wrap-up. The bad guys get waxed, everybody who needs it is rescued, and comes out the stronger, ad naseum. Anthony Heald does his usual great job of voice characterizations (or I would have rated this much lower). The sound effects and music are great, and expected. Overall I would be cautious in the purchase of this audio book."
5,EXCELLENT NOVEL!,"After suffering through some pretty lousy Star Wars novels, 'The New Rebellion' was a breath of fresh air. Rusch captures the characters so vividly that you can practically hear a John Williams score in the background. I place this novel in the same category as the Zahn novels - top notch!"
2,"Good at times, but mostly stupid","This book had a good idea and ran smoothly. But the problem was that the author pictured Luke Skywalker as a PERSON not a Jedi Master that owns an acadamy, brought Darth Vader to the good side of the force, created Rouge Squadron, and played an important part in the destruction of the Death Star. By the authors description of his powers, he is a mere Jedi trainee that has just learned to manipulate the force."
2,No More Drama - It Really Wasnt Much...,"I enjoyed Drama Queen, the prequel to this book. I was expecting more from Kayla this time around, maybe thats why I was disappointed.I was confused with the Kayla and her sister Angelica. I guess in the first book, she didnt really commit suicide? It was all a bad dream?I didnt really read all of this book. I skimmed it and just read the interesting parts with Terrell and his girl.:o("
3,Not so good the second time around,"Although I liked this book, I am disappointed with the main characters from Drama Queen not being the main characters this time around. I personally want to read a sequel that continues the storyline of the original main characters.Sigh...this book was drama filled, but I give it a C+ rating at best. Good Luck next time Ms. Hunt."
3,FIRST ONE WAS BETTER.....,"I read this book in one day and I must admit some of it was kind of boring. The title of this book fits perfectly because there was much more drama in this book than the ""Drama Queen"". I liked Roni in part one, this one she was a straight up stupid and inconsiderate. I was glad Toby took his ring back and found someone who valued him more than Roni did. How dare she tell Toby she won't cheat on him again and wind up doing just that!!! Roni was like a female version Terry, they were the main two with all the drama.And for those of you confused about Angelica, she didn't really die in Drama Queen. It was just a dream(more like nightmare) Kayla had. It was mentioned either in the Prologue or Chapter one, but it was a dream..."
4,The quality might surprise you,After reading all the reviews I really need to throw in my 2 cents. I got my Mr Coffee essentially free with a $50 gift cert for Macys (of all places).....3 years ago. Since then I've built my wife and I my version of a wet cappaccino (sp) nearly every morning. Only complaint is that it can't handle a fine grind for a double shot...unless you prime the shot once with the pump for about 20 seconds. Then wait a few and then let'er rip. No breakdowns and I've let it run hot for a whole day! Only problem is Karen broke the filter handle so now I am surfing to find one. My unit froths great with the rubber end I stole off my last Mr Coffee boiler unit. The plastic thing is useless. But I read here that many units die within a month. I'm shifting to Gaggia Classico and see how the other half lives! Mr Coffee will be there to bail me out should the Italian Stalion fail.
1,Consider this a review of the sender.....,"I ordered this as a Christmas present for my mother but i can't really fault the product for my disappointment. Target-Direct was the sender who either forgot, or was too lazy to include packing material inside the shipping container. Had they chosen to ship inside the product box alone, i think, it wouldn't have bounced along inside the other box for it's entire journey.Amazon should review it's future with this supplier!."
2,lacks enough pressure to make good espresso,This unit makes OK espresso for the price but it lacks sufficient pressure and/or flow to make a good espresso. The crema lacks &quot;character&quot;. Moreover there is a design flaw in the POD adapter as the pods do not properly fit in it. I bough the unit in a B&M Target and returned after one day.
5,A necessary read.,"This report of the history of the planned movement of Muslim action/plan to become a power in all countries to gain command is a MUST read for all people aware of the threats to our freedoms.Well documented, and organized, it is an excellent source for real information.Joan Thielmann"
5,A true eye opener,"Okay, so we all know how much of the Arabic world sided with the Nazis during WWII, and we all know that anti-Semitism is rampant, both historically and present day . . . but I had no idea to what extent these dynamics manifest in this world of ours.This book is such an eye opener, and after the third read through, I continue to glean so much more information and insight.Bravo, Mr. Timmerman, for bringing to the public a book which is a must-read for every American, and for every person wishing to live in ""the Free World."""
3,It's grainy indoors,"I didn't listen to the other reviewers - but I should have. I liked the size of the camera, the price, the plugins - but the picture was REALLY grainy without natural light. Outdoors was picture perfect, and indoors in the kitchen in the daytime is great - but if you don't have natural light you won't be happy. Also, software is relatively useless. I'm taking it back and trying the SONY TRV..."
1,risk in defect of CCD,"My canon zr65 suddenly went black (No image detected). From what I found on the web (a lot of people have the same problem), the CCD may be the cause. It looks like there is a quality issue about this part. To replace a CCD is very costly. Take your chance."
2,"Looks good, but.......","The player came in excellenct condition. Exactly what we were looking for: compact, sturdy, a pleasure to look at, easy for a 4-year-old to use. But as a previous reviewer commented, it refused to play all songs on any cd inserted. Out of 13 songs, it only played 9. I tried many different cds, but to no avail. My product was returned the day after I received it."
4,jessjoye,"I have to admit I liked it!! I am a bzz agent, and I will be truthful and say I didn't expect to like it. I have a 10 page rule--if a book doesn't catch my interest, I put it away--so I picked up this book thinking I would be on to my next selection shortly...no such thing happened! As a profession, I am an Independent Sales Consultant--so I do value gaining insight on any form of Marketing strategies. I gained a ton of insight from this book--I have even reccomended it to fellow business associates. It is an easy fun read that you should try!"
3,A BzzAgent reviews Grapevine,"I am a Bzz Agent (read the book if you don't know what this means) and am reading this book as part of a Bzz campaign. I found it interesting because it helped me see behind the scenes at BzzAgent (who gets picked for campaigns, examples of bzz, etc). I can also see how it would be interesting to someone who works in marketing, as it's all about word of mouth marketing and how it works or sometimes doesn't. To me, much of the book seemed like either common sense or like a commercial. Perhaps that's because I don't work in marketing, though!"
5,What a great way to teach children the Laws of Attraction!,This is a wonderful book for all ages! It teaches children the much needed skill of creating their reality using the Laws of Attraction!
1,Not interest in his patients or the results,"My wife bought this book and was impressed with the ideas. We are lucky enough to live in Jacksonville where he has his practice. After a year of seeing Dr Randolph she had seen little improvement. In fact after an extended menstrual cycle she went to a regular appointment in an emotional state hoping the get some further guidance. The office staff were rude to her and drove her to tears. Dr Randolph's reaction was to discharger her as a patient. So if you react well to his treatments then your in luck otherwise he's quick to get rid of you so you don't infect his perfect data. There is a reason ""Big drug"" companies are big and is because they have to maintain fair records of their drug effectiveness. Dr Randolph has no such requirement. He was happy to refer my wife to a Doctor that doesn't even practice the same techniques. He's a quack."
5,Next Step,"Tim Gautreaux is a Cajun who happens to also be a gifted writer. He has learned from the best, including Walker Percy. The plot of this novel is relatively common and could be transplanted to many isolated groups of people. However, to really understand the Cajun mindset, what better way is there than being a Cajun? Having lived less than thirty minutes from the town in the story, I feel the environment in this work. The characters are believable. The sub-plots are true to life. This novel offers Cajuns their greatest weapon against non-native representation of their culture: self-representation in well-written form. Reading it will help one understand a interesting group of Americans."
5,Magnificent!,"This was a wonderful book; I absolutely loved it. Everything was great: the settings, the dialogue, the story, and the characters. I wish the book had gone on longer; Mr. Gautreaux could easily write a sequel with these engaging characters and exotic milieu. The reader from Virginia who gave this novel one star is utterly wrong."
1,I am pained by this book,"Oh, Boy. What tree died for this work. I just don't get it. I agree with Texas and Virginia. Can not recommend."
5,epson black ink cartridge,"Printer cartridge works fine, as expected. I've done the installation many times, and it was very easy."
3,Okay only,"The book had a lot more writing than what it said in the description. But it is okay, since I can still read what I need to read for my class. Hopefully, some of the side notes will help me in my class."
5,A good fantasy read,I really enjoyed reading this fantasy novel. I especially liked how Saberhagen interwove world history with a Russian fantasy setting. I highly recommend this for anyone who is looking for fantasy from a different perspective than the standard semi-European background.
2,Third time was not the charm,"Flexon 50-Foot Three Tube Sprinkler Hose FS50This worked well for the first two times I used it, looked lightweight and on the third use it sprung a leak on the end . So if you buy it keep the water pressure loooow. Amazon refunded my money without return of the hose nice work Amazon that is why this is not a 1 star review and I bought another brand Flexon 3 Tube Sprinkler Garden Hose"
5,Very good Up-Conversion,"This is an excellent DVD player for the price.I bought the LG 7832NCX to replace my Samsung HD931.Both dvd unit used the same Faroudja Scaler but the LG (Zenith) has done a better job to integrate the chip correctly.I'm using a Sony GWIII KF50WE601, great match.Using the Sony GWIII I don't see too much difference between 720P or 1080i, but several people agree that 1080i output is better.The DVI connection is OK but the analog output give better results.The remote control is horrible...So far I'm very please with LG products, good quality for cheap.I don't want to buy anything else from Samsung."
1,No more component upconversion - waste of money,"Read www.avsforum.comAll new units coming with new firmware that disables component up-conversion. DVI only. If you got your dvd working - its not the newest model.Plus, this player doesnt support Divx and Xvid format.I desided to pay 90$ extra and buy Momitsu DVD880.You can use Momitsu with PAL or NTSC dvd.You can upconvert480p to 720p and 1080i via component cable(as well as DVI) and its 50Mhz and 60Mhz.You can play Divx and Xvid.Momitsu very often release firmware updates.Sound and video are outstanding.I bought mine from Extremephono."
3,All I have to do is dream...,"There were some great performances in this season - none more so than Linda Gray (Sue-Ellen). I liked all the story-lines, all except for the grieving Jenna. By the later episodes, I couldn't stand watching scenes with Jenna in it! Priscilla Presley's acting was terrible. Yes, the Marinos deal (Angelica Nero) stretched out a bit too far but overall the storylines were quite solid. It had to be a writer's nightmare to write for Season 10 given this all was a dream but we see how great a legacy Dallas has become and Bobby returning was necessary"
3,Great Product for the Price,"I got this because they were affordable and because the reviews were pretty decent.The side without the pad does put pressure on the head and I put a cotton pad on it to help cut back on that.Sounds a little muffled, but it works pretty good considering the price."
4,Canon ZR70MC,"This is a great camera for the price. Pros: The zoom is incredible and the outdoor picture quality, awesome. Small, light weight makes this a prefect camera for vacations or home video needs. Can't beat it for the price. No motor noise when played thru a TV. Cons: Indoor picture quality is grainy unless additional lighting is used. The Mic doesn't pic up sound real well for anything over six or seven feet away.(Optional Mic cures this) Still photos aren't very great, but work for emails. Overall, a great little camera well worth the price. Those who took or sent it back after a day, didn't give it enough time. Definately recommend it."
4,Replacing poison with other poisons...?,"This book offers a wealth of tips on cleaning a home in an environmentally sane manner. It warns against rubbing layer on layer of poisonous chemical cleaners. It lists known-green replacement products, as well as recipes to make your own.What struck me was to see Borax occur as a regular ingredient in those recipes, since this is a toxic material, according to Wikipedia:[...].Note however, that there are lots of recipes using simpler ingredients, such as baking soda, vinegar and castile soap. And the explanation of the simple chemistry involved is quite nice."
2,Reads like a harlequin,"I absolutely love Iris Johansen. I've read all of her last six or seven books. But this book I found to be a disappointment. It reads like a Harlequin romance novel (and for some that may be okay, but not for me). The story wasn't as deep, the characters not as intriguing, and quite simply I had to struggle to get through the book. It was a disappointment. I hope her next book will return to her intricate plots and deeper characters - and less on the silly and unrealistic sex twists that this story held."
3,Another fatality!,The only things I liked about this book were the dolphins and some background on their behavior. The main characters were boring and choppy. Nicholas was at least a bit interesting. I really didnt care for the hero and heroine at all. The romance had no heat to it whatever. I felt the book was written in spurts and I couldnt get it to settle down. But I did finish it and all's well that ends well. This was a first of IJ's and I dont think I will rush out to get another one.
1,felt like I read this story before,"I'm pretty sure I've read all of Iris Johansen's books and I've enjoyed them very much. For some reason though, ""Fatal Tide"" just didn't feel like her best effort. I was extremely bored with the plot. The thriller/mystery part just didn't seem well developed and the characters a little flat. I'm almost positive that Melis came from another novel of her's where the main characters find themselves freeing children from a brothel very similar to the one Melis is flashing back to. If someone can tell me what book this was I'd appreciate it. (I have to confess that I skimmed the latter 1/3 of the book and read the last few pages)"
2,It was koO,"I dont think this group is really that good but the ""Blunts of Fire"" track is Hittin!! I think that song alone was worth the $5 I spent on it. There are a couple of other tracks on the cd that I can listen to which would be ""Late Night"" and ""So Crazy"" but Im not down with the rest..."
4,Helpful if you're a bit of a dummy when it comes to colour,"I'll admit it. I'm not the best person to set up a colour pallette, so I've found this book to be very useful. It is well organized, espeically with all the swatches printed to the edge of the page for easy reference. As it boasts, it works well for both print and web, and for helping to color manage your monitor. I can't say I'm a fan of the graphics Krause uses as his examples, but that isn't the focal point of the book.The back cover reads: 'An abundance of creativity--at a glance' and I think it is safe to agree with that statement. It sure is one quick reference book; no frills to divert the task at hand...picking the right #@!* colour!"
4,Lots of color combinations,"I just received _Color Index_ in the mail yesterday and really enjoyed browsing through all the color combinations. There is a lot of information packed into such a small book. My only complaint about the book is that the author doesn't give hexadecimal numbers for any of the colors except the ones in the Web-safe palette. For those of us who sometimes choose to use nonWeb-safe colors for Web design, adding the hexadecimal values for all colors would have been useful."
5,Worth the money,"Tasteful use of color can make or break a web or print design, and this book is an invaluable tool in that endeavor. At first glance it might seem overpriced for nothing but a collection of color combinations, but you'll find yourself turning to it again and again for inspiration.The color schemes are organized by category (""Quiet"", ""Natural"", ""Restrained Chic"", etc.), and each is presented in three different ways - as a set of plain vertical bars, as a homogenous pattern, and used in a simple iconic design. Throughout the book are brief passages on different color techniques (""Unexpected Color"", ""Muting"", etc.), which help stimulate brainstorming and experimentation.The book is well-made, too - it's printed on sturdy paper, conveniently sized, and thoughtfully bound in a waterproof vinyl cover. Stick it in your pocket or backpack and take it anywhere.A great practical purchase (or gift!) for any graphic designer."
4,"Yes there are flaws, but still well worth it","This book is a great resource for those who sometimes have trouble putting together a good color scheme (and who doesn't have those troubles from time to time?). It's true that the colors won't look exactly the same as they do in the book. But this is still a great source for inspiration when you're stuck. You can use the formulas in the book as a starting place, and tweak them as necessary to make them work for you. I keep this book at my desk, and I and others that I work with refer to it often."
1,"If you are a professional who works with Pantone book, DON'T buy this book.","Usually, I don't write reviews, but in this case, I had to.As a graphic designer, when I get recommendation for a book, I always keep in mind who gave it to me. That is why I bought this book. It is recommended by HOW Design magazine. But when I opened the book, compared the colors in it to the Pantone swatches, I was unpleasantly surprised. The colors are WAY OFF from what they should look like. It might have good ideas about colors, but when I realized the quality of this book is low, it turned me off.If you are a professional who works with Pantone book, DON'T buy this book. I am very disappointed, especially because ""HOW"" graphic design magazine is the ones who publish this book."
3,Sweet romance,I liked this book but it can be a bit slow in the middle. The banter between them was enjoyable. I like the personalities of this male character and the one in Elusive Dawn. Wish there were real guys like that.
3,LIKE IT BUT DONT LOVE IT,"I like the sounds of all the night creatures and the pictures but its not a ""lift the flap book"". It's more of a ""pull the tab"" thing. I feel like the quality of the paper is flimsy and it wont hold up for years to come like our other similar books. I would recommend an adult to help out the child when reading this one. All and all it's not bad but I like the ""farm animal sounds"" and ""vehicle sounds"" better"
3,Not an exceptional bargain,"The wood finish and detail were above average, but not excellent. The instructions can be improved with better diagrams. Considering the price and shipping costs I don't consider it a bargain."
3,Ergopod chair,"This chair is pretty comfortable and does support the lower back if you lean back. The arm rests seem a little high for lounging around and it would be nice if they had drink holders built in, not ones you have to buy seperately and hang on the side. They are a little heavy to carry, but I guess that means they're well built for heavy people."
3,All The Numbers - Judy Merrill Larsen,"The book was good, but the mother character just kept getting on my nerves. She loses her son and the book deals with her grief and how her life was affected.For a while I could feel her grief, but as the book progressed, it seemed like she became a whiner, and I began to lose interest in her. Actually, she became an annoying figure.Reading the other reviews, it seems I am alone with how I felt, but I read enough to know a good character when I read one."
3,m.doc's music,M.Doc is a true writer in his heart and in his soul. I wish he would write from his heart and soul! Write what's real --- not what you think your peers would like!
2,don't judge a chi by its color,"This Chi was super cute, but it didn't work as well as the other Chi's. My hair is naturally curly and full of frizz so this straightener just didn't work for me. Someone with less frizz might still be able to use this one, but I still think the regular one works best."
2,Far Fetched,"I had read his previous The Kitchen Boy, also not believable, but a definitely likeable novel. What went wrong here?This was a great story, fictional though it may be, waiting to be told, but Alexander has totally goofed this one up. Not at all interesting or gripping. I tend not to skim over lines, but found myself doing so, without missing the plot at all. In fact, what was the plot?Rasputin holds a very strong mythical advantage, and this was not at all explored here. Poor job!"
5,Is he a holy man or slobbering drunk?,"Telling the story of Rasputin, the legendary mad monk, during the raging of war during 1916, his daughter Maria wonders exactly what kind of man her father really is. Is he a holy man or slobbering drunk? An unrestrained animal or a healer? When she begins to flirt with a young man, she has no clue where this will lead her or her father."
1,Extremely Liberal/Biased,"I would not recommend this book to anyone. I needed it for a Medical Sociology class and as I worked through the chapters, I began to notice its insane perspective on America. In sum, this book states that all people that are rich, have health insurance, and/or are white are the reason for the poor's suffering. Apparently if we were more like China and Cuba with slimmer divisions in wealth, we would be better off (pg. 68)."
2,"3 ""Too Brilliant"" Performances by Legendary Duo","Caiman and Urania: you should be ashamed of yourselves!! You permitted 3 gorgeous performances to be reissued in the keys of B-Flat Major, f minor, and B-Flat Major; instead of A Major, e minor, and A Major. The sound is far too brilliant and tempi are all too feverish as a result. These legendary performances on LP in the correct keys were a joy to hear, the reissues are not.Playing pieces a half tone sharp (""scordatura"") might work with Paganini or Biber. With Faure and Franck it sounds downright weird.Come on folks, reissue these properly, so that they could get 5 stars."
4,A Pretty Good Book,This story is quite a good one. It's not one of my favorites but i've read it a couple times. It has lots of different people who contributed to it and it's sad and happy.
2,Dated,"I couldn't find a downloadable verion of Kenny Ball's rendition of Midnight in Moscow, so I got this CD. Well, I now have a rather costly version of that one piece, since I didn't care much for anything else on the CD. I found that a little of this music is enough."
1,Watery,This product want not what i expected. Verey watery and runny. Application was messy and left black streaks. Also took a long time to dry. This is the worst mascara i have every used. I would like my money back.
5,pleasantly surprised,I have been so happy about my Forerunner. I am not a person that typically likes to track my training and am not good about keeping a log. This watch is great! It keeps my log for me and calculates my results in ways I didn't even know I could.
4,Pretty good deal for the money,"I looked around on the internet for a while before choosing the Garmin Forerunner 205. It also came recommended from a friend and was quite a bit cheaper than the 305. The watch itself is very user-friendly- I'm still learning all the ins and outs but i don't forsee a lot of problems. My only dissatisfaction is with the size and this is the downside of ordering something only from the internet. The monitor piece is huge and i wish I would have gotten something smaller. So if you want something unobtrusive, maybe find another watch. But please don't go into a store and use up the salesperson's time and then turn around and buy it online. That qualifies as bad karma."
1,Don't plug into USB or else,Our Garmin Forerunner 205 has blown two of our motherboards after plugging into the USB port. The first time I thought it was my fault with having just installed a new video card. After replacing the motherboard and upgrading the computer power supply to 450 watts the Forerunner did it again. The capacitors on the ASUS P4SA-LA motherboards can't handle the recharge load.
5,Cross Country Coach Says it is top of the Line,This GPS Navigator is probably the most practical timing device we use for our training program. Its accuracy in some of the wooded areas that we run in has been a pleasant surprise. I would reccomend this training device to any cc coach that is looking for specific pace runs from his/her team
4,Still the best out there.,"Still the best GPS on the market for runners. Its easy to use, the software is seamless on my PC and most importantly, it gives me the information I need to be a better runner. Actually makes going out for a run enjoyable. This is my second after loosing my 305 the first time around."
4,Great product,"I've been using the Garmin 205 for almost two years now, and I can say I am happy with this product. I use it a lot for running and biking, also run triathlons several times with it and worked perfect. (I never used it for swimming nor under heavy rain). I also travel overseas and usually take the garmin with me for running, and I works well most of the times getting accurate signal. Only one time in Dominican Republic I could not get signal...maybe was bad luck... Bottom line, I would recommend."
4,Great value for the price,"This running GPS has been replaced by a newer, sleeker generation of devices but is still available and definitely worth the money if you want a watch with lots of features. It will do and display all sorts of stuff, much more than I use it for (total time, total distance, and last mile pace are about all I use). It works with PC based software (Training Center) or the on-line Garmin Connect site so you can view maps and stats of your runs, and track performance over time. It also works with third party web sites like MapMyRun.com if you prefer that. Really the only significant negative factor is its large, somewhat klunky form factor. It doesn't bother me while running but I wouldn't wear it around like a sports watch (which is possible with some of the newer, smaller, more expensive Garmins). If you don't mind the size it is a very capable watch with good GPS reception and lots of features, at a reasonable price."
4,Great training aid for my upcoming marathon,Forerunner 205 Personal TrainerBest purchase in years! The 205 has assisted with keeping me on my marathon training schedule. Love the neat features of the virtual runner mode. Also with the 205 I've been able to record all my training runs and see the progress I've made each week. Before you decide to run your first or next marathon. I suggest getting the 205 if your the Iron Man type one of Garmin's advanced forerunners may be what you need!
4,Overall great though tough to navigate,"Other than the next higher model going on sale just as I bought my 205, I have been very happy. Nice and simple GPS that is easy to learn if you are familiar with other Garmin products.One limitation that I didn't realize is the difficulty in using this GPS to navigate a route. You basically have to go there first and then save your route if your going to use it. ""Motion Based"" web site has other user routes that can be downloaded though I would rather create my own route and then use this GPS rather than a map (tough to do on my bike)."
2,Unreliable,"The 205 works ok when you are very near to your ""home"" Go just a few miles away and it can't get satellites. I tried to use it at work today, 8 miles from home and first it asked if I was indoors and I said no and then it would ask if I had moved 100 miles since last using it. It is not worth the agravation! I like to try different trails and hikes and the 205 just can't reliably find satellites.It was a waste of money! I will be looking for something else and it definitely won't be a GARMIN!"
2,Impression of Garmin 205,"Once the Garmin 205 acquires satellites, it seems to be accurate in recording time, distance and speed, however it takes an extraordinary amount of time for it to lock to satellites. On more than one occasion it took 15 minutes or more before it was ready to use. That is much more time than I am willing to wait before starting my exercise routine."
5,i love it,i have had this for 3 years and i love it. i run many training runs and races with it. it helps me keep my pace.
5,Awesome!,I love the Forerunner 205. It's all I need in a GPS Watch. The only functions it didn't have compared to my Forerunner 301 was the heart rate monitor. I had a lot of issues with the heart rate monitor and was only able to use it a handful of times. This watch is perfect! I highly recommend it.
5,Forerunner 205,Product works well. It's great to see real time data while running. When you download to the computer it gives you even more info such as elevation gain and maps of your runs.
2,Problems with the 205,"I am a runner and was excited to receive a 205, but now my 15 month old 205 no longer works. I have had problems with the buttons on the watch. First the ""enter"" button quit working, but I was still able to use the watch. Now, unfortunately the power button has quit working making the watch unusable. According to the Garmin web site it will cost me $69 to have it fixed since it is out of warranty.Prior to the watch going bad, I really liked it. It's performance exceeded my expectations, but apparently there is a manufacturing problem with the switches, I have seen others with the same problem. I don't know if they have fixed the problem or not, so I guess buyer beware."
5,"works well, but...","This watch works great and is much better than the previous model as it seems to give more accurate pace data and distance data which is repeatable with a high degree of accuracy. Some things, though they work fine, are hard to set up. For example, the virtual partner, to get it to work, requires several button strokes to bring it up for a daily run. Another thing that always amazes me, is that one cannot put in your own lap marks and still have the watch keep track of mile mark settings, too. For example, a favorite turn past a give tree, is not able to be marked on the fly and still have the watch keep on tracking mile settings. Overall, the watch does work very well for its intended purpose."
5,garmin forerunner,"watch works great everything it said it was, really helps keep your pace when out for a run"
5,Garmin Forerunner 205 GPS Watch,Got this for my husband and myself although my husband has been the only one to use it so far! He loves it.
2,Not water resistant,I have used this product for about 8 months and it has worked fine until I went for an 8 mile run in the rain yesterday. Now there is a waterbubble under the screen which fogs the remainder of the screen area. I have always been gentle with the device and this was my first heavy rain exercise. Now I need to return it and look for something that works better in the rain.
2,IN PREDATOR II WRESTLING MENS SHOE WRESTLING,"Nice wrestling shoe. However, they are already falling apart after only 5 weeks. I did contact Infinity and they said they are going to try to replace them."
5,A Moving Journey,"Liesel Litzenburger is what Saul Bellow called ""a first class noticer."" She sees, hears, feels the textures of her northern world with such intimacy that every page holds surprises. I love the way she uses landscapes--especially frozen ones--as a counterpoint to the inner landscapes of her down-at-heel characters. Her novel has a rivetting arc from abandonment and yearning to healing: it's a story of consolations that never feels predictable.The author is so open to the souls of her fragile characters. . . and to the fickle winds that sweep through them. This book is a keeper."
3,Definitely original,"I bought this novel after reading the first few pages in my local bookstore, and while it perhaps wasn't as suspenseful as I'd hoped, I do admire the writer for her insights into her characters and for the way she brought to life the Michigan landscape. I did find the flashbacks and multiple viewpoints slightly offputting after a while (she seemed to give attention to a few characters who contributed very little to the overall story) but still, at a time when a lot of books seem to re-hash old stories, or draw on the author's own experiences, I really enjoyed this novel for its originality."
4,The Chronological Johnny Ace: 1951-1954,A great music CD. If you are a fan of Johnny Ace's this about covers his music.
5,A Great Book,"This book is great. If you love books about the future, then you will love this book. It is about a boy named Cody and his is in one of the many evil CCR's (Confederation of Consolidated Republics) children's barracks. Cody manages to escape with Toni, a pilot for the U.S. Army Rebels. This is just one of the many dramatic scenes in the book. I read the book in 3 days. I just couldn't put it down! It has three parts: Escape-Return-Breakout."
3,Funny Movie about a juvenile delinquent,Real funny movie with Kramer from Seinfeld as a convict. Great laughs
4,It's funny i don't care,"This is movie is so funny and i don't understand y it is. Some things that people say and do in this movie r jus silly, but they make the movie funny. I don't care about what the other people say about this movie. I believe what that other person said about watching this movie over and over b/c i know i can. I love this movie!! Michael Richards really makes it good, (Kramer from Seinfield) and that's when some people dind't recognize him until later when they saw him on Seinfield, but i always remembered who it was. Michael Oliver also does a good job of acting retarded and being funny at the same time. I don't like the 2nd one as much but if u like movies that are silly then see this one."
3,"Ok movie, Ok dvd....","I love the problem child series. This DVD is ok. It lacks extras. The video is pretty cool because it is standard, but they should have also added widescreen. This movie is just 3outof5 stars. I perfer Problem Child 2. But they still have not released that movie on DVD. My request is that they release the rest of the series."
3,blades,Haven't had to replace no comment. Not really pleased with the Rotato blade peeler it self. Would not recommend to a friend
4,Mysterious dungeon crawl introduces interesting foes,"Here's one of the best modules in the great, retro-style Dungeon Crawl series from TSR! Hellgate Keep has lain sundered in ruins - it was destroyed by the Harpers and the demon-spawn there were totally eradicated. Or were they? Now, your high-level heroes (9-12) get a chance to find out what new diabolical menace has come to plague the ruins... I'll give you a hint, though, there's this ancient clan of evil elves... hmmm..."
5,No hang ups?,"I would have liked 1 1/2"" nails for adding plywood sheathing to my shop walls, however these nails turned out to be quite handy for quickley scabbing on nailers too. No malfunctions other than nailing down plywood so fast I got ahead of my insulation coverage...ooops, will drill holes and fill that spot with foam... and will be ordering more nails when needed..."
5,Alessi Soups,"I had been using Alessi Soups for years, and then learned that some of the markets were no longer carrying the product. I was lost without them, and decided to check on Amazon. I was delighted to find the full line of these great soups.I really don't have a single favorite...they are all wonderful. I often add something like pulled pork or ham to the pea, bean and lentil soups which makes them even richer. I'd really be lost if they were no longer available. I add some chicken legs (and escarole)to their chicken soup making it even more delicious. (I also add a pinch of my favorite herbs). In each case,I add a little extra water(and cooking time)to compensate for the extra ingredients. You can use your own tastes and ideas to add to these wonderful soups. These soups are great on their own, but if you are a cook (of sorts) you might enjoy experimenting...like I do. These products are a wonderful time-saver for the busy homemaker!"
2,not what i expected,"I admit I was shopping by price. My friend had the bought lesser version that has INCREDIBLE clarity and sharpness. So I thought if I bought the ""better"" more expensive version, it would be EVEN BETTER. Well for some reason. It isnt. They look identical except mine is more grey or something. I had already thrown out the box and everything before I realized all this so I didnt get a chance to return it. But oh well. I guess its ok. If I had the chance, I would had bought the same one she got instead. And saved some money in doing so."
3,Microsoft LifeCam VX-6000,Decent web cam. Takes OK pictures and video but the effects included could be better.
3,Overpriced piece of junk,"I would have done a video review, but this webcam is just too big of a piece of junk to do that. The picture quality has never been great, but I can deal with that. It's the audio that really killed this product for me. From day one, the audio has had problems. First, there was just a humming noise that would bong out the ears of whoever I was talking with on the other side. Now, the audio has totally given out and the camera is essentially useless unless you know sign language or have a decent external microphone that you can plug in.In short, two thumbs down for this webcam.***EDIT***Ok, I've changed my opinion a little bit about this webcam. But, that is only because I found instructions online for taking the product apart (goodbye warranty) and fixing it so the sound works. The instructions on this website: [...] ' fixed my webcam. It's still not the best cam in the world, but at least it works decently now."
2,Stop working,This product works fine for the first couple of weeks and now it just stop working.The camera just went blank.
4,not bad,"I have had some problems with it, primarily the built in microphone - don't count on the mic working well, or at all."
1,Software issues,"Dont microsoft ever send their software thru Quality Assurance checking? They asked me to install a windows update (KB something or the other) saying that it prevented the software from running at 100% CPU usage. Lo and behold, it still gets stuck!! Task Manager dutifully reports that it is after all consuming all resources."
1,Extremely grainy image,"The image was incredibly grainy. We tried maxing out the lights, playing with the settings, nothing helped. I can't believe Microsoft is selling this as a higher-end camera. We have two other webcams to compare it to, an iSight hooked up to a mac mini and a built in camera in the EeePC 1000HA. Both are light years better than this piece of junk. Returned it that day."
3,Only half a product,The camera is excellent - but: I never got the sound to work. My guess is that there is a Windows-internal conflict of interrupts. The support software is so without any diagnostics that I was forced to buy an external microphon. Now I hae a pretty picture and good sound but two extra cables running over my desk.
4,MICROSOFT WEBCAM,THE WEBCAM WAS VERY EASY TO SET-UP. I HAD A LITTLE PROBLEM WITH TRYING TO GET IT TO SET ON TOP OF THE MONITOR BUT HAVE WORKED THAT OUT.
3,NOT ALL THAT HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT!,"hi just so you know, this is the very first web camera that I have purchased...I am not that happy with it! Its speacial features can ONLY be accessed via Window Live for one,Windows live on my computer wasnt accepting the camera, so I called the company and apparently I have to disable all other start up programs each and every time I use it!!! CrazyAlso, I am not that impressed with the picture quality...Good things about this camera are that it has (when working) neat faces you can use while talking,but like I said when working as it sometimes doesnt even work with Window live..."
3,Just a webcam,"Its a nice web cam, but its just a web cam.Face tracking doesnt work on highest resolution. The best luck i everhad with a web cam was to use a video card with capture (ATI) and my handy cam. Nothing still touches that."
2,Disappointed,I purchased this to replace an old Intel cam that I had. The quality of the picture with the new LifeCam VX-6000 is very poor when comparing it too the old Intel. I have tried everything from settings to re-installation with no success. The cam produces a grainey picture that is very poor. This wasn't a cheap product and expected to get an excellent product from Microsoft.
2,BEWARE OF MIC!!!!,"I bought this product: MS LifeCam a little over a month ago. I made a video and there was this buzzing sound. After looking into it and various forums, found that there are many people who bought it with the same problem. There's a site that shows how to disassemble it and to move the metal surrounding the mic to solve the buzzing sound!I do not recommend tampering with it; I recommend buying a different product until MS makes it right."
1,"defective, disappointed","There was nothing wrong with the way amazon shipped it to me or condition, it was the book that was totally missing the V and W words, well on a positive note V and W aren't as important as A and B."
5,All-around excellent,"I see some of the other reviewers are photo-snobs, but I'm willing to bet they're pro photogs. who are pissed because they didn't make it in.As for the customer service issues, I can't say. I ordered a custom cover on December 10th, and it arrived on the 23rd. Being in the publishing and bookselling business, I'll have to say that if they could do that with the holiday crunch in full-swing, they're doing pretty well. I'm sure there were mistakes, when you're shipping that kind of volume, it's inevitable that some will fall by the wayside.Point is, don't let either negative position keep you from buying. Anyone I know who bought or received this book loved it, loved the cover and are very satisfied."
1,A PALE IMITATION OF A MASTERPIECE,"As an art major in college in 1986, A DAY IN THE LIFE OF AMERICA introduced me to the world of photography and images. In spite of it's advance publicity, AMERICA24-7 sadly fails to capture any of the magic, grandeur or scope of it's obviously copied predecessor. From the embarrassing cliche image on the cover, to the sanitized, saccharine view of America created by culling through tens of thousands of amateur and non-amateur photographs, 24-7 suceeds only in proving that there are few second acts in American life. What a waste of opportunity."
5,Real Americans need read this,"Excellent expose of the madness behind Bush dynasty. So good it hurts... Every American should read this book. Unfortunately, most won't--and those who do will do so too late to stop the Bush family from leaving an appalling blemish on history. Generations of Americans will suffer from the Bush blight on our constitutional landscape. Americans must get the facts about this political family. And then we must act to save what's left of our country from their continuing avarice."
4,GOOD REPLACMENT,"I ordered this for my 6.5hp Scotts self propelled lawn mower, Tecumseh. It fit well and I loved the fact that it the shipping was really fast! Would reccomend it."
4,Not OEM,This is not an OEM part as it is slightly larger then the original part. If you don't mind a very tight fit then this is a good economical choice in replacement filters.
5,Eddie Would Go,"The book Eddie Would Go was a true story about the life of Hawaiian legend Eddie Aikua. The book tells the tale of his life and about Hawaiian culture. I liked this book a lot because it helped me imagine the Eddie Aikua who was around a couple decades ago and the story made me keep reading.It was exciting and had a lot of adventure in it. It doesn't compare to any other story I've read before, it was like a biography but also at times it was like a guidedbook to Hawaiian culture.The things I disliked were when the author branched of to something boring or urelavent to Eddie's life. If I was to give it to someone, they would have to know a little about surfing in the early days and like lots of adventure and suspense. I would definetly recommend this book. It was one of the best books I've read so go get a copy and enjoy."
2,Tarnish on the Platinum line from Travelpro,"I am a legitimate road warrior who travels weekly and counts on rollaboard luggage to stand up to my level of punishment. I happily used the previous edition of the TravelPro platinum rollaboard for 3 plus years and was delighted with weight, storage features and particularly the extending handle that made a remarkable difference in how my shoulders and arms felt after going from one end of O'Hare to teh other end of Miami airports. The bag finally broke (handle) and I promptly bought another one. I was disappointed to see that the new bag's extending handle had been made much flimsier in the interest of weight. after just two months of use I already am seeing looseness and instability. Not good for a top of the line bag from a reputable company. Am already looking for a replacement bag that can stand up to my schedule."
3,The Robert Risko and Philip Burke Nineties show,"I don't know if Rolling Stone didn't use any art in their early days, or if the editors of this book just figured that they had to concentrate on appealing to their contemporary audience. Anyway, these very entertaining caricatures are mostly from the late Eighties through the Nineties. Risko and Burke account for a large percentage of the total. Risko especially is good, practically the second coming of Miguel Covarrubias. There's too much Madonna and not enough Sixties, but overall this is a fine compilation."
5,WONDERFUL Testimony of Faith,"I read this book because Eddie Charles is coming to visit my school. My eyes were opened up on how a person can turn to such a sinful life. I am hoping that the message he carries will influence some of my students. Hopefully, his story will keep some of them from making some of the mistakes he made. I also took to heart what he said ""Only God can change a person for the good""."
5,Good Keeps Getting Better,"In his first album minus the band, Matthew Good delivers his best music yet and it seems as though Good just keeps getting ""Gooder"".From the moment you open the disc you know you're in for something better than just good...Something great. The artwork and imagery is excellent and the jacket design is somewhere on the brilliant side of the spectrum.But it's not all just eye candy. The lyrics and music are sweet to the ear, food for thought and substance for the soul.The songs all seem to be meticulously crafted to make you think while still allowing room for you to rock out to them. Make no mistake. This isn't flash-in the-pan pop.While this is definitely a ""play through"" disc, tracks worthy of mention include, ""Pledge of Allegiance"", ""Weapon"" and the excellent, insightful rant, ""21st Century Living"".Bottom Line: Matthew Good = Great"
2,"Not ""Intro"" enough","This book made my statistics class a little easier, although it still talks in a confusing mathematical language. It needed to focus on the beginner better."
5,Lovely,"This movie was lovely. It made me laugh and cry. Hehehe it has a lot of humor in it. It is a vibe of Ghost World and Virgin Suicides. So if you like those movies, you will love this one."
4,Connections that Last Forever,"""J"" and ""R"" are two very different people. ""R"" is in his 40s and runs an upscale clothing store. He's a conservative, very particular creature of habit, and he has a secret that keeps him separate from the rest of the world, stopping him from making friends.""J"" is a 17 year old goth teen poet who hates her family, talks to her dead grandmother, hangs out in graveyards, self mutilates, and makes paper airplanes out of her own suicide notes. She was just fired from her job for farting, of all things, and decides she'd like to sell clothing in ""R's"" store.What ""R"" and ""J"" do have in common is a need for change, and together, they'll get it.This isn't really a feel good movie. There's a lot of sadness and futility here. However, it is also an ultimately positive movie about family, friends, fate, forgiveness, and connections that last forever, even beyond death."
1,Let me be the first to give this book its first 1 star review.,"There was a person who gave this book three stars for issues such as poor editing and insufficient explanation of abstract scientific ideas. I fully agree with these complaints and would like to add one small thing to that list of complaints. This book just straight sucks its not hard to write a book that gives the reader a small bone every so often, for instance he covered complex machines and theories leaving the uninitiated (such as myself)hunting for tidbits of information on our own just to keep up. If you are a hardcore scientist do go ahead and pick this up, but if you are a non scientist buy with caution that is unless you are looking for extra kindling for your fireplace."
2,This is not Lawrence M. Krauss's best book,"Science aside, this book is poorly written. Other reviews mention ""rambling"" and ""disjointed."" I must concur. You get half way into some of the later chapters and you can't fathom what the point of the chapter is or how it differs from the preceding one. Some of the sentences are so long, you have to read them twice to identify the verb. I found it difficult to pick this book up to finish it."
5,Best Tweezers Ever!,"My cousin, an esthetician, introduced me to these years ago and I began freaking out when I recently lost my only pair! I've never seen them in stores and even ordered my last ones online. Highly recommended!!!"
2,Bad Baxter,"Very disappointing CD--Dry, repetitive, and hard to believe, boring.There is much better Baxter available on his self produced live CD's.Buy them and by all means, see him in person."
4,Brilliant Allegory,"Of Time and the City isn't only about Liverpool. It could just as well be speaking of Detroit today or any other city decimated by ""progress"" and the pursuit of the next new thing. The people progress from childhood to old age as observers of growth and decay while all the time it is happening to them too. The film is a brilliant allegory about life in the modern world. The narration seems to begin with admiration, journey through disappointment, only to arrive at hope for the next generation. The constant quotes read as captions to the photography are worth the price alone. The narrator's personal comments may rile some but are only part of a portrait of life in the big city. It ain't all hearts and flowers."
2,"Great imagery, lousy narration","The idea for this movie, comparing imagery from different eras of an industrial city, was engaging, as were the movie shots all the way through. The narrator however was a self-obsessed blowhard with a booming, breathless voice, completely ruining the effect. I was able to watch most of it with my TV muted, but of course not really enjoy it. The music, when I dared listen, was good."
5,Taaaaa-buuuu,"Got this for my mom, It's her absolute favorite perfume! She's been wearing it for yrs..A loyal customer. I like this bottle better then the standard tube shape."
4,Easy option,Buying salad dressing online is actually an easier option for my family than going to the store. Our shopping access is pretty limited. This product game quickly and in good shape even after traveling a great distance.
5,Summer Dream,A great background music for a quiet time or better yet to go to sleep by. The birds are great.
5,Great Music,I received this CD in great condition and play it frequently. Really great background music.
1,Quite unreal,"We gonna have patience while reading thick fiction!Never Look Back was extensively researched and the background(the place where the protagonists have moved to) was believable,too - Hostile,hungry and indigent folks staring at the main character while she plowed her way through the slum.What wasn't quite believable were the protagonists - I do not mean,people do not act like those fictitious people,predictable and one-dimensional characters only do average readers injustice.Perhaps ""simpler""(I do not mean to belittle!)readers will share the protagonists' thoughts and ideas,but I guess average readers are always waited to be impressed ,or touched deep inside,let alone the critics' wants."
3,"The Supplies for the Confederate Army, how they were obtained in Europe and how paid for.",This was a very interesting book as it explained how many of the products that were needed by the South were actually provided by our European friends. The battle for Southern Independence was a battle that not only the CSA wanted to suceed ..... but our European neighbors as well.
5,float boat,performs as advertised. lots of fun for the less serious mariner. this inflatable boat is very rugged and totally portable when deflated. suggest you buy electric air pump to fill it up unless you like turning purple or are naturally a windbag. this raft for the money is a great deal and sturdier than something you would find at your local box store. good luck.
4,Nice surprise,"I've never written a review before, but I wanted to in this case because this book provided insights I didn't expect. I read this one just to try something new and I was happy to get quite a lot out of it. It's a unique twist on the ""secrets to success"" books out there, in that the writer is so young, so I think that causes his fresh style of writing. I guess that's what I like about the book - fresh writing style, fresh ideas, and a nice overall perspective on life and business success."
5,Great Cars,"The DVD set of a great collection of magnificent cars. Six disks cover seven different marques (one disk splits time between Farrari and Alfa Romeo). Each goes into the history and the mystique behind the cars. I ordered the complete set at an amazingly low price and it came in just a couple of days, brand new and unopened."
4,"Yes, it does work","This product definitely works as advertised. It does take a little time to adjust each pocket to fit your personal preference though. Now I wake up every morning with no back pain, not to mention the money I saved from not buying a new mattress..."
5,Wilton's Done It Again!,"As an avid baker, I'd been wary of the whole silicone trend, but when I saw this one on sale, I thought it wouldn't hurt to try it, right? And I'm glad I did. Not only did it stand up to the oven's temps, the cake release was easy, with no lingering cake pieces as can happen when you don't cool a metal pan long enough before flipping. And clean up was a snap! I would recommend this to anyone who likes to bake!"
4,global survey of rural workforces,"Keep in mind the book's publication date of 1978. It surveys globally, which is appropriate since it was put out by the World Bank, whose remit is to aid global development. Various developing countries are looked at, for the composition of their rural workforces.A reader might notice that several of these countries studied in the book have since gone on to developed status. South Korea, Taiwan and, largely, west Malaysia. While India, which is also looked at, is still largely poor and rural."
3,"doen't really do what it is supposed to, but still some fun","We got 2 of these for our toddlers, and while it doesn't really fly or hover, they still like to chase it and throw it and jump on it as it kinda acts like a balloon floating slowly. I don't think older kids would have much fun with this at all, but for some toddlers who like to chase things around the room, it worked ok."
5,Informative,I read the book to educate myself about considerations when setting up a mobile business. To me the book was very informative and gave a thorough overview about the topic. It provided necessary amount of data and statistics and some concrete check lists (some items obvious some not so). The book was not focused on any particular market region but had a global perspective.In the beginning the book said what it is and what it isn't.In my case the book served the purpose very well. Next step would be to select the preferred business type and go more in detail (with another book?).
1,Battlefield 2,"My son cannot even play the game, as we're unable to install it...it requires a 128MB video card, which is incompatible with our PC.It's VERY frustrating to have purchased something that sits unused and worthless."
5,Super fun in so many ways!,"This game is great! You can sneak around as a sniper, hiding in the grass and the enemy will walk right by. You can drive around in a tank, smashing through boxes and strafing buildings. You can plant C4 explosives on a tank, run and watch it burst into flames. You can run into a firefight with a bunch of your friends, talking, laughing and yelling along the way thanks to VOIP. You can even fly planes and helicopters (I still need to try that!) All this on my AMD 2100+ with a GeForce 5700 LE....it runs smooth! It can take a few minutes to get playing on line but much, much better than most other multiplayer games I've played. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
1,BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK,"Be forewarned--this game will play like a pig on probably 90% of the rigs out there (I run an ATI Radeon 9600 with 256 RAM; 1 GIG RAM on the Falcon NWest box) and the game looks like...well, we can't use words like that here on Amazon. Beyond that: Loads sloooooow; hangs the system searching for servers...and when you DO get a game loaded, the maps are cramped...really close-combat tactical. Desert Combat is FAR better, plays better...this game is a MAJOR disappointment. Wish I hadn't opened the box and could get my $$$ back."
2,waste,I do not normally buy electronic products that are not from older established brand names. but I was desparate to replace my five month old Panasonic SL-SX450 player which stopped working a week earlier (I use it for jogging).This model seemed quite affordable and was well recommended. Using a different headphone the Coby MP-CD521 has good sound quality but the battery life is terrible (4-5 hours on Duracell).In my car the anti-skip protection is a joke.This product may be useful in the homes of stationary people.It is definately NOT for active people.
4,good cheap cd player,"good cheap cd player. doesnt keep out dust at the job site too well, but i keep it in a separate bag and it seems to go well. this coupled with the dc adapter allows for good multi situation use."
1,COBY MPCD521 PERSONAL PLAYER,I HATE IT . IT WORKS FOR AWHILE ATHEN STOPS WORKING COMPLETELY. I'VE ORDERED ANOTHER TO TRY IT OUT. MAY HAVE TO RETURN BOTH
4,durible,I constantly dropped this thing or my niece would and it didn't break I finally upgraded to an mp3 player and gave it away It worked great while I had it never had any trouble
1,More like a toy than a Cd player.,"Never played very well from first. Skipped tracks when reading mp3 cds, just quit working after 12 mos. I guess you get what you pay for. Doesn't say much for the quality control of Coby products. I would not reccomend this player to anybody, nor will I buy anymore Coby products if I can help it."
1,Very disappointed,It did not work at all!!!!!! I had to send it back. I did not even try to buy another one.
1,coby mp-cd521 personal mp3/cd player 120 anti-skip,this is a rip off .i got it and tryed to play it an it will not play its said on disc and then it shuts off.i have try all cds and mp3 it will not read any.so im sending it back.they will repackage it and someone will get.they need to just recall them or stop makeing it.so dont lose your money over this coby mp-cd521 personal mp3/cd player 120 anti-skip player.
2,Low quality,"I actually gave this CD player more than 1 star only because I felt that they were trying to offer an affordable product. Unfortunately, it's worth closer to about $4.00. It's like a throwaway player. As others have mentioned, the display is hard to read, and it's terrible to have to forward through songs each time to find your place on an MP3 with 70 songs. The headphones, quality-wise, are like something out of the 1970s. Also, despite the anti-skip protection, it skips.I still think there's some merit to trying to get affordable electronics out there, but I would market this for kids to play with. It would last a few days, maybe even a few weeks."
3,Meh,"I guess I got my $20 of use out of it. I think the laser or laser driver has stopped working reliably. It refuses to see the disc I put it, whether it's MP3s or a regular CD. I did use it for almost a year before it stopped working entirely, but I'm not going to buy a second one of these."
2,Disappointed,"Although I am not a musician I appreciate good music and while this album covers many of the songs I loved when I was growing up in the forties I was very disappointed in the CD. The main problem was too much drumming. It sounded more like Lester Lanin whom I enjoyed for dancing, but this CD was overwhelmed by the drummer. I'll probably never play it again."
3,Review,"The CD is great, however, I purchased this CD with volume 2 and I never received vol. 2. I am in the process of filing a complaint."
1,foot pump does not work,"I tried the foot pump, but could not get it to work and inflate the ball. It's pretty much a wsste of money. Not a advertised."
3,"Nice book, but doesn't really grab us","I love the message in this book, that even when Little Gorilla isn't little anymore, everybody still loves him.I'm meh on the illustrations - they're not my favorite style, but that's rarely my priority anyway :) The color choices seem odd to me, but really, I don't pay that much attention myself.On good days, I like that the book has a nice, calm pace. On other days, I'm frustrated that it takes so long to get *absolutely nowhere*. I know it's a board book, but it's a book about birthdays, not bedtimes - you'd expect a little more action in it.And most of all, it doesn't really engage my nieces, and never has. When we read it, it's because I choose to read it for a change, they never do."
2,Not water resistant,"I bought this watch for my wife for every day use. She had an old Timex that she would never take off for shower or swimming. Let's say this thing has been through a lot but it worked.I picked this watch based on the very positive reviews and also because it should be 99 feet water resistant. After first time in a Jacuzzi the crystal became covered with moisture - from the inside. She liked the watch a lot so she decided to keep it and just be careful with it. 8 months since the purchase the adjustment screw rusted off so she will be wearing this watch until the time change since she can't change the hour on it.I am very disappointed in this watch. If the description said that it is not water resistant, I just wouldn't buy it.I'm giving it two stars just because it does look very classy and well made. The date box is tiny, but since my wife can see it, I'm not making a fuss about it."
3,You'd better be familiar with music,"If you don't know how to read music, you might struggle some with this DVD. Also, if you are completely new to the tenor banjo you might want to find another source to get you started. Once some basic note and chord reading are acquired, this can be a helpful tool."
4,THE KING OF ATLANTA IS BACK,THIS CD IS NOTHING BUT P TROY COMING HARD TRACK AFTER TRACK. NO MISTAKING IT HE IS THE KING OF ATLANTA. HOPE TO HEAR MORE FROM THE PT CRUISER BABY!
4,the king of the south,mane pt is back with a hot one yall.....mane go get this one rite here.....the only thang that i didnt like is the beats sound the same and recycle and stuff ...but dont get me wrong it a go getter
4,Fun for Toddler,My daughter loves the felt board at library reading hour. So I bought her these for home. She likes them just as much and we use them daily.
2,Fuzzy and choppy,"I've had this camera for a little over a year. Initially it was easy to install and use, and worked well enough for my needs. But after a few months the picture quality is horrible to the point where people say I look like an alien. I've tried cleaning it but nothing changes, and it hasn't been dropped or done anything but sit on my desk."
4,"pretty good,","I have 2 of these vx-3000's. When I talk to my wife on them it seems that sometimes one will not have picture or sound. Its not always the same one. I can't figure it out. When they are working right they are great, but that's not often enough. I still give them thumbs up for their picture quality and face tracking. I am sure it is a software issue, I just haven't had a chance to solve it yet. I'd give it a 5 if it had sound and pic on both every time."
2,Works great... for a few days,"Had my camera for a little over a month.Went to use it today and the picture doesn't come in as anything but lines.Used it to make phone calls - but I could have gotten a microphone for half the price if that's what I wanted!Thanks for nothing, Microsoft. What a POS."
4,Good camera for cost,"This is a pretty good camera for the cost. It's basic, don't need to be a computer geek to figure it out. I like that it can sit on my computer monitor & not just on the desk. Keeps it out of the way. Zoom & clarity are easy to use also."
2,The camera was unusable due to poor driver software,"I thought this camera would be a good value for use in video conferencing between my daughter and her grandparents. Unfortunately, I found the software fraught with problems. First, on install, the driver software refused to recognize the camera microphone. Several reboots and re-installations eventually resolved the issue. When I downloaded the latest driver from Microsoft, I found the install routine trips an exception in the .Net framework, thereby preventing me from using the latest drivers. The final nail came when the camera microphone showed itself apparently incompatible with AOL IM (the video worked, but no audio). This was with the latest version of AOL IM. I finally returned the camera in disgust.The camera was installed on an XP machine that is maintained current with patches and updates, and has no unusual modifications or software running in the background."
2,Disappointed,I bought 2 of these cameras. One for myself and one for my sister. At first they worked no problem but now they harldy ever work. I don't think it is the camera itself but the program you use with the camera.
1,decent WEBcam,Picture is a little dark and focus is rather tricky but compatibility is excellent. Perfectly functional unit.
1,Worthless!!,"I tried out this webcam on H.P. and Compaq computers, both running Windows XP; I could never get the Microsoft Lifecam VX-3000 to work. I gave up. Now Tiger Direct is making me pay return shipping so they can replace this worthless unit with a replacement that probably won't work either."
4,Good camera,"We bought this webcam and it works reasonably well. It was easy to set up and use. We find that the built-in microphone doesn't work very well, so we use a Logitech headset."
3,"Installation is awful, camera is ok","Microsoft completely f'd up the installation process on this one. It should take no more than a minute to install the drivers from the CD but once you install the CD you have to wait 30 minutes for it to complete. It gives you very little information in terms of status so you never know if, or when, it will complete. It connects to the internet a few times so you have to permit it through your firewall and then tries to install some Windows Live BS. It finally restarts your comp for you without asking which is very unnerving.The camera itself works OK for the price and specs once you finally get it installed."
3,Good cam. Virtual pan and zoom overrated.,"The pan and zoom is essentially useless, so don't buy just for that feature. Very good picture. The software is a bit microsoft-ish. On vista it keeps trying to re-initialize with the first run routine every time a user other than the original user logs in, over and over. Annoying. Microsoft software once again glitches with MS OS."
3,Major BUZZING after about 6 months of light use. VX-3000,"Got this for a family member and after about 6 months of light use the sound started getting faint and then the buzzing started. Every call the buzzing seems to get worse and worse. I had them move the webcam away from any electrical source, speakers, monitor. Nothing seems to help. I have one and two other family members have one and they all work great. (except for being really grainy in low light, but I guess thats to be expected)"
4,Good at price point,"A problem I did have was that the wire was a little stiff so when I place it on my monitor, it has trouble maintaining it's angled down position. It could be just my copy.Image quality and sound quality is honestly good enough, it's $30! I can't stand the hater reviewers out there. They expect a top of the line product from a $30 web camera. Maybe it's your video card? sound card?I used this product to video chat with my girl when I was out of town for 8 months. The image quality on this one blew her webcam out the window. I was actually surprised by the image quality from this guy. However, when I recorded a video or took pictures, the quality did seem to be a little ehhhhh but once again..it's $30. As long as my girl can recognize my face on her end and notice that I haven't shaved for a couple days...I can't really complain."
4,Webcam for general use,"This is a good cam for general use. It was easy to setup and configure and it works well for Skype. It is not a hi-res camera and it gives a grainy picture in low-light conditions but for general use, it is good. If you want a cheap easy to use cam for something like Skype, it will work fine."
1,forget it,"I bought both this model and the next one up. The picture is grainy, dark and somewhat discolored. I have another cam from another producer and it is much better. I do not recommend this camera."
3,Bad Mic,"I haven't really used the built-in mic coming with this web cam until today when I found an annoying background noise with it. You know I'm a PC fan and IT professional. I'm very familiar with PC and its peripherals and how to trouble shoot them. The thing is: the built-in mic of my PC works perfectly, which means you just can't blame the sound card or its driver. I searched online and found quite some complaint against VX-3000's noise. Seems my unit is broken: the advertised noise-canceling doesn't work at all!It's not a big deal because every PC has a mic port now, but the bad thing is: you THOUGHT it work as advertised, with noise-canceling offering crystal clear recording, bluh, bluh, bluh, when in reality it doesn't work that way, and you got pissed off :-)Why they want to put a mic there inside a webcam? The common sense is those ""x-in-1"" things are more prone to problems than devices with dedicated features. I won't buy any webcam+mic any more."
1,Web cam,When I got the web cam the installation is very easy to do. But when I got ready to to use it the picture was not clear at all. Does not work!!!
5,Very nice,"This was a very nice purchase for me. The quality of video is sufficient for my use. I don't use a lot but when I do I am very pleased with the product. It works well with Skype. I have not tried Windows Messenger yet, but I'm sure it will work just as well. Reccomend this product for the web cam newbys like myself. Cheap price, great value."
4,Simple to use Webcam,"Received the Microsoft LifeCam VX-3000, installed the software, and had a web conference going in a matter of minutes. Very straightforward and easy to install and use."
2,POOR QUALITY WEBCAM,PURCHASED THIS VX-3000 WEBCAM AFTER READING INFORMATION ON THE BOX. IT STATED THE CHRYSTAL CLEAR MIC AND SOUND ETC.....WELL THE MIC WITHIN THE WEBCAM REALLY SUX AND MOST PEOPLE I TALK WITH CANNOT MAKE OUT WHAT I AM SAYING. PICTURE QUALITY IS VERY POOR AND NOT TO CLEAR EVEN AFTER MANY ADJUSTMENTS. EVERYTIME I TOUCH THE CAM IT UPSETS AS THERE IS BARELY ANY BASE TO IT AND IF YOU EVEN BARELY TOUCH THE TOP OF CAM IT TAKES YOU TO ANOTHER WINDOW ASKING IF YOU WANT TO INSTALL WINDOWS LIVE MESSENGER.FOR SUCH A SMALL ITEM THE MOVING PARTS ARE VERY VERY STIFF AND HARD TO MOVE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS.......SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY A GOOD WEBCAM.........NOT ONE WITH MICROSOFT ON IT
1,Microsoft LifeCam VX-3000 audio problems,"I bought two of the Microft LifeCam VX-3000's and had audio problems with both. The microphones did not pickup my voice, however the video was excellent. I read several reviews by others on the internet that stated that they had experienced microphone problem also."
2,this camera sucks,"sure i didn't spend a lot of money on it, but seriously? reminds me of my very first cell phone camera. spend a little more money and get something better..1 star because it does in fact work, its just the worst camera i have ever seen"
3,Good Value Webcam,"Camera was really easy to install. Picture quality is ok, haven't tried sound yet. One issue is the delivery. Might've not been handle as well which caused a pixel or two to be broken."
4,Life Cam,"Though it wasn't as sharp an image as I would have expected, the web cam does its job for skype to skype calls. The quality does worsen as the internet connection worsens unfortunately."
2,So-SO,This web cam is a sure example that you get what you pay for. Not the best but with a lot of light it is ok
1,webcam 3000,"I have bought 3 of these units in the past 30 days.. of which, one doesn't work at all.. one only has the mic working, and one is intermittent, works when it feels like it.. I wouldn't give you 3 cents for a dozen of these things.. I'm going to shop for something that works everytime, not part of the time.. these look nice, easy install, but.. don't work! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY UNTIL SOMEONE FIXES THEM.."
1,some units have defective audio,"Like several reviewers below, I experienced defective audio from the built-in microphone. There was a loud hum that drowned out anything I said. Microsoft tech support couldn't assist. I would rather have used their product, but I returned it and bought a Logitech camera. Worked fine."
3,not too bad for the price,i bought this web cam because of the price. it's pretty easy to use. but i've had problems synching the audio and video. works for the purposes i got it for though.
4,Good product for its price,"With the $[...] rebate, this is a very good product for its price. The face tracking is a cool feature. The working even in low light is not upto the promise. Turning on a lamp behind the user or keeping the window open compensates for the shortcoming."
5,A great piece of equipment,"I'm a tad bit behind on some technology gagdets...and this product was more simple and helpful than I thought. It is very easy to install and has step by step instuctions. As far as in the quality, it has a very crisp picture as well as the sound too...I would definitely recommand this webcam."
4,Excellent value for the money,"Not quite plug and play, but still quite easy to use. Once you load the software, you have no problems."
3,video is ok sound sucks,sound captured from the cam sucks [it cuts off] you can use a separate mic to solve that problem.
5,Great,"This was a good product until my new laptop came with a built in camera. Safely hangs off of doors, monitor and what ever. Decent resolution."
1,Bad picture quality,"I ordered two of these for christmas, one for me and the kids and one for my parents so they could see the kids. The picture quality is terrible. My face looked like one of those weird grainy blobs you see in the government espionage movies before the high tech guy comes in and crystallizes the picture. Eyes, Mouth, hair, and red green or purpley skin. Awful awful awful. I was disappointed because the description microsoft gives of the product is for use as a webcam for windows live. But then when you get the box it says ""Offline performance only"" in regards to pixel resolution. They advertised it improperly online. Anyway, if you're looking to use this for live video don't get it. I didn't try to see what the resolution in the picture capture or the video messenger was like, where you tape a message and then send it. That resolution was supposed to be a bit better. Live video is always less vivid, but shouldn't be THIS poor. I'm returning them ASAP."
4,LIFE CAM,FOR THE MONEY THIS WASN'T A BAD BUY. IT WORKS AND GIVES OFF A FAIR PICTURE but not the worlds best but can't complain about the price
5,Better than season one.,"Season two offers more innovative topics than season one. The chapter devoted to nebulae integrates with the amateur astronomy community, showing comprehensively how astrophotography works. I would love to see more and more astronomy documentaries recognizing the efforts of amateurs and their activities.The metal case is great. The 5 disks were included in a very narrow space."
3,Okay for the price,"Good to about 20 feet. Wish viewing area was a bit farther, but it works for the price."
5,Behind the Costume,"A very interesting insight into the world of cosplay. Looking at the people behind the costume as much as the costumes themselves, this is a must see documentary."
4,"A lousy Kindle download, but a very interesting read","I've downloaded many Kindle books, but this was the worst. The paragraphs were not normally printed; lines of text just stopped. Two words were run together without a space between them more times than I could count.Other than that, I thouroughly enjoyed the book. Mary Todd Lincoln was a very interesting historical figure. Her relationships with her sons was heartbreaking. I felt that I came to know her as a person."
4,An interesting look into the life of Mary Lincoln - from her perspective.,"A friend loaned me this book with high recommendations, and I found that I enjoyed the story and ""learning"" about Mary Lincoln - even if it was historical fiction. I now have a desire to learn more about Mary Lincoln and will check out the biography by Jean Baker. This isn't normally the type of book I would read, but I enjoyed it nonetheless and will also pass it on to a friend."
1,Profoundly disappointing,"I realize that historical fiction is allowed some license, but the Mary Lincoln of this book seems to bear little more in common with the real one than a a name, a place and a husband. On the upside, if it were a novel about a woman living in the 19th century, it would be a good one in that it is well written and the narrative fine. But given its subject matter, one would think that it would offer an account of things that really happened. When, living in Springfield, Illinois, the main character of this novel sets about a plan to lose her virginity out of wedlock, it becomes incredulous and the novel lost all credibility."
1,Were the previous reviewers family members?,I struggled through to the end of Chapter 8 before setting this one aside. I consider my 1-star rating to be generous.
3,"Cute, but not what I expected",The chain is too thick (I couldn't see it from the picture) and this makes them much less elegant than they could be. I think they would fit better to a teenager!
3,Useful but uneven,"This book has a good deal of information and is obviously written by someone who knows his amps, but it is not clearly written and is not really for the uninitiated. While the schematics of the different sections of an amp are useful, there are still unexplained terms and the presumption that everyone owns a Fender or Marshall amp. If you are looking for more broadly applied information about tube amps, look elsewhere. Another gripe for me is the cheesy printing and lack of even one real photo to aid in explaining parts layout (This is not an inexpensive book!). Good if you own an newer Fender or Marshall and want to make it sound more vintage or want to troubleshoot amp problems. Not for the homebrew amp crowd."
2,...,"This book contained lots of information, but the way it was presented made it extremely difficult to accomplish my final goal -- to build a class A amplifier. The book is not a tutorial on so much the construction of tube amps, but rather a long list of modifications. Perhaps the biggest problem that plagues this entire book is that the author repeatedly tells you to open up your '60s Marshall or Fender or Traynor amp, all of which are extremely expensive and not exactly readily available. Because I don't own any of those amps, I was stuck to just read about adding more midrange to a '66 Marshall JTM, rather than learning how midrange actually works. Also, the author spends too little time on important subjects (tubes in general were basically covered in 3 or 4 confusing sentences...)."
1,swv6813,Switching blueray DVD signal is impossible. Useless product.No-one answers help line. E-mail address was bogus. I usedhighest Quality HDMI cables. Neither sound nor picturewould pass through with the DVD signal.
3,Halfway works,"The product does not automatically detect and switch imputs. Customer service was worthless. Besides that, this product works great. There doesn't seem to be any degradation of the picture quality."
4,for Block fans,"Althoug different from what I am used to expect from Block's excellent novels (or short stories) and not the same taste, I think this is a must reading for Block readers. Character building and relationships in Ariel give strong hints about what came later."
4,"Nice, but firm","The topper had to be aired out for several days before the smell went away. The size was perfect for my Queen sized bed. My hip no longer aches when I lay on my side. I sleep very well on it, but I guess I was expecting it to be a little less firm. Density does not only mean quality, but firmness for support. 6.5 supports well, but if you are looking for quality and softness, 5.5 density would probably be better."
5,ZZZZZZ,"This is the greatest thing to help you sleep since they invented the pillow. I have had this for about 4 months now and I have not slept better, sounder or deeper since. I suggest anyone to purchase this before you buy one of those expensive memory foam beds, sleep number beds, or tempur pedic."
5,Very nice!,"I bought this because the dorm mattress I sleep on seems like it is made out of concrete and makes a good night's sleep nearly impossible. I weigh about 220 lbs. (100 kg) and the density and thickness of this mattress seemed perfect. I would recommend airing it out for a few days before use to get rid of the paint thinner smell, and for a full size mattress I would recommend queen size fitted sheets to fit over this and the mattress due to the added thickness to your bed. Feels so nice!"
4,very helpful for bad backs,I've had back surgery and am in a low level of constant pain. Now with this mattress topper I don't get up in more pain than I went to bed with. Really helped some hip pain too. Glad I purchased this topper rather than buying a new mattress. Helpful that it comes w/a mattress cover that fits the extra height and haven't had trouble w/my regular sheets going on the bed. My dog loves it!
1,HORRID TRANSLATION!,I teach spiritual formation at the seminary level. This is one of my all time favorite books. And it has been a favorite in every class where it has been used. Unfortunately some of my students did not pay attention to the translation I requested and bought this one because it was the cheapest that Amazon listed. They uniformly hated the book until I read them passages from my translation. Please do not buy this translation. You will hate the book. Buy the Beevers translation from Image Books and you will be delighted and love this book.
3,"Honestly, better than I had been expecting","Fair amount of full-frontal nudity and even very, very brief explicit nudity in this release, which is not a movie but more like a made-for-cable short. Saying that it has an hour-long runtime is generous because the majority is shot in super-slow mo (again...no reason for the producers to do this except to stretch things out). Run the whole thing at normal speed and you can get through it in half an hour or less.Amy Lynn is not the best-looking model here by a long shot--there are several others who top her."
4,Much better than that Orange Brand,"Corn meal never tasted this good.These Smart Puffs are less salty, contain no dusty orange coloring and don't leave your hands and teeth looking like you ate a ball of fake orange cheese. They melt in your mouth.I would definitely recommend these to a Cheetos addict to let them see what a more natural like product tastes like.These contain real dairy ingredients and whey, for those who are allergic to milk.My only complaint is the price. At over thirty bucks a case these are quite expensive. Grab these when they go on sale for under twenty bucks."
1,...,It pisses me off seeing pirates booty coming up as a VEGAN item when its obviously not.The seller needs to learn to label/tag their products correctly.
2,Not really impressed...,"I've bought these in the grocery store before, but apparently I'd forgotten how bland they are. There are better things like this out there, and cheaper too, so I will not buy these again."
2,this time a purple one,"I was sent another non-printed cage cover. I was told I didn't have to return the red one...but never did receive the printed cage cover I ordered =( Don't think they have any in stock, but was never told one way or another."
4,Good primer gun,"I bought this gun to use for high build primer and so far it's worked great. There's very little overspray, and considering the materials being sprayed, there's not excessive orange peel.I purchased a Vaper spray gun set a couple years ago and they have made a couple improvements. The cup is made of a more durable aluminum and has a plastic cap. Also the finish on the gun body is better."
4,A very nice collection of early Billie.,"Great early material from the Teddy Wilson sessions also featuring Lester Young. Unfortunately there is no documentation. Still, an exceptional deal at the low price."
5,excellent,"Great if you have a Mac OSx computer, since nothing seems to work with them. however, this one does and it worked perfectly fine with me."
3,"Milwaukee Chuck 1/2""","This chuck is very good quality and I'd recommend it to anyone needing a chuck of this type. I had to order this chuck as a replacement for the one that came with my 1/2 Milwaukee Drill. This chuck will ""bend when put in a bind"" which lead me to purchase another. The torque of the drill will overcome the material the chuck is made of. I would still recommend this chuck as a replacement if you were to get a wobble in the chuck after some hi impact drilling."
2,Drab & Predictable,"With apologies to an author who clearly tried very hard, this novel is drab and predictable, hampered mainly by the kill-or-be-killed philosophy so precious to American militants. The superficial characters are black-or-white, villain-or-hero types. The plot starts slow and than goes quickly nowhere. Frankly, if you're looking for the end of civilization, go for something better written and better thought out (like David Brin's The Postman) or the one that really started this genre and still captivates readers, Alas Babylon by Pat Frank. This book is not in that league."
1,The Apocolypse for Dummies,Reisig has taken a fairly good plot and embellished it with shallow characters and sophomoric writing. An insult to the genre! Not recommended for adult audiences.
1,Stinks. Don't buy it. I'd give it zero stars if I could.,"I'm astounded that anyone could think this was a good book. The writing is poor, the plot hackneyed, and its stereotypes border on the offensive. Don't waste your money on this book or this author."
2,Corny,"When the poles of the earth suddenly shift, Vietnam vet turned pilot Travis Christian finds his whole world turned upside down. With the destruction of the Florida Keys and the death of his girlfriend he struggles to make sense of the new world order with the assistance of a rather cliche group of friends.I found I enjoyed the beginning of this story, but soon I found myself groaning inwardly with the eyeball-rollingly bad cliche characters. From the Sensei (a Japanese swordwielding martial-arts expert), to the beautiful woman he rescues and whose husband conveniently dies. Of course the woman never really loved her husband (bonus cliche points), the drunk preacher, oh and shall I mention the crazed blood-thirsty Hillbillies? Ooookay.This novel read like a videogame. I admit I was disappointed. It started out great but rapidly devolved into extremly silly cornball action devoid of any realism.2 stars."
2,For completests - some good songs but poor sound quality,"There are some very good tracks on here - but the sound quality of many is poor. I particularly like the Blues Breakers tracks, like Telephone Blues. The early Yardbirds tracks are interesting but some of the songs are so-so. They are interesting because they have some of that great heavy, distorted guitar sound which is generally associated with Eric Clapton's later Blues Breakers work. Sound quality is dubious to bad on several tracks (perhaps not surprisingly considering how long ago they were made)e.g. tribute to Elmore. The CD includes a couple of covers of Chuck Berry songs with a more rocking feel, as well as more traditional blues.Before you buy this though, consider buying the following Eric Clapton blues albums first - they are much better:Eric Clapton with John Mayall's BLuesbreakers,From the Cradle,Unplugged."
3,"OK, but not much more.","This product works ok...When it works. Mine died for seemingly no reason, but luckly I contacted the company and they sent me a fresh one for free.Still this is a cheap drive, but if I were you, I'd spend alittle more on a better one. Buy a Lexar brand one instead...I have a really old Lexar drive that I've never had problems with.By the way, I tested this drive on Freespire Linux and it works great."
3,quicksilver,"pretty disapointing. after cryptonomicon i expected something that would really hold my interest. i hope the following two books are better because up until now neal stephenson has impressed me with his incredible imagination, wit, and style. quicksilver just doesnt grab me like his earlier works."
1,Disappointed in the extreme.,"I've read every Stephenson novel and enjoyed them all, but the mans ego has finally exceeded his talent with this work.Thousands of pages of trivia kitch with no coherent plot or compelling characters. Plenty of Stephensons signature style laid over material and characters that are so thin and uncompelling, you will hate yourself for having stuck with it.Unlike Cyptonomicon and a few of his other books, this one never 'gets good' after a long introduction. It just goes on and on and on without ever going anywhere interesting."
2,100 Words or Less,"This is the case of rock solid research ruining an interesting story.Stephenson's setting and characters are vivid within their world. But too much so. It's as if every detail he's uncovered needs to be included. Every historical fact needs to be stated. Seemingly minor characters are encountered haphazardly, only to coincidentally emerge as important historical figures: an adolescent Ben Franklin? A young Newton?It's too much. I wanted a story that dropped me into that era. I ended up with a comical Who's Who date book. I had to stop reading after about 50 pages."
3,"Why, Neal, why?","Add me to the list of fans disappointed with this effort from Neal Stephenson. I've been a huge fan of his - Snow Crash, Cryptonomicon, and Diamond Age were all amazing novels. Quicksilver, while it has it's moments, isn't in the same league as these previous works. For this reader, it's been a hard-to-follow rambling story without any discernible plot, which with a novel of this length has made for a very difficult read."
2,Needs an editor - disappointed,"I approached QUICKSILVER with great anticipation - I have enjoyed all of Stephenson's other works and I am a particular fan of historical fiction. What a great mix! Unfortunately I had a very tough time even finishing the book. It cries out for an editor - the book is as bloated as the latest Harry Potter, the characters are poorly drawn and the plot is so complex that it becomes meaningless and impossible to follow. Characters come and go and the dialog is particularly bad.My conclusion is that if you want historical fiction go to an author who specializes in that genera (Patrick O'Brian for example) and go to Stephenson for a visionary masterpiece like DIAMOND AGE."
2,There are Much Worse Books Out There...,"As someone who loved Neal Stephenson's previous works, (including his alias Stephen Bury) and would rate them all a 4-5 star rating, I was sad reading this. I normally read one book per week. It took me 3 months to read this. It was just barely interesting enough, (in spots) to keep me from throwing the book down in disgust. In fact that's what's so infuriating; that it is good in about 30-40% of the book. But the rest is so painfully boring, that you almost stop reading. I could not be more angry reading this after coming off of a terrific book like Crypto...I refuse to buy the other books in the trilogy, and I've never done that before.-george gilmore"
1,DO NOT READ,"Wost book in the three part series, and the whole series is not worth it. Better off reading his other work which is far superior."
2,Slowsilver,"I must say, when I first heard about this book I was certain that it would be right up my alley. After all, I've always been a big fan of Newton and have taken all of the calculus sequence. I find the origins of calculus to be fascinating. This book, though, was not.The characters, if we can call them that, have absolutely no personality. The plot...oh, wait there really isn't one. So I can't really comment.When I was younger, and had lots of time, I would finish every book I started. Now my reading time is scarce and precious. I just couldn't keep reading this book after about 300 pages of sleep inducing tedium."
3,Wonderful Voices for CD version,"I think if I was reading this book instead of listening to it on CD I would never have finished it. However, the voice talent on the CD takes the meandering aimless plot (can you even say it has a plot?) and makes it a very entertaining experience. The voice talent, able to nail almost all the British and European accents along with their perfect timing for the dusty dry humor that Neal writes, has made this book on CD a very worthwhile experience. And I have always been a sucker for books that include the history of science. Every chapter has an interesting science history fact or two along with the author bringing out many unusual details of life in the late 1600s and early 1700s."
4,Or 3? Or 5? Or 3?,"Seems hard to make up my mind on this one. It is a huge book, and still only the first of three. It gives no closure - just cliffhangers for the next volume. It is filled with weird and wonderful charcters of a time long gone (thankfully!).If you thought Cryptonomicon lacked detail, or had too few obscure ""sensual"" scenes - this is for you. If you love Neal S. and will read anything he writes, this is for you. If you are going on a long trip - this is for you (if you can handle the physical weight!)On the other hand, if ouy prefer either pure cyberpunk (Diamond Age) or pure fantasy (LOTR) - look elsewhere. The science stuff is decent, but the descriptions of Europe are somewhat lacking - even London seems a bit over the top (and that is something I never expected anyone to manage)."
4,Growing,"This set of books just gets better and better.. i can never really tell where any of his books are going ( save to a special place on my books shelf. This is an author that i change my schedule for, to make time to read his books."
4,Go in with Different Expectations,"I guess I'm one of the few who actually enjoyed this book, and I think I know why. When I first heard that this was going to be the first part of a trilogy called The Baroque Cycle, and was goint to be set in the late 1600's (mostly), I immediately knew that this was not going to be another Cryptonomicon. I decided in advance that this was probably going to be a ponderous, lengthy, overwrought book that was going to take patience to read, as it was probably going to be little more than set-up for the next two books in the series. I also know that Stephenson has never been able to satisfactorily end his books, so I wasn't expecting any change there.Coming into the book with this mindset allowed me to rather enjoy it. Had I been expecting a Cryptonomicon II, like so many other reviewers were, I would have been sorely disappointed.So, open your mind, change your outlook, and enjoy..."
1,Item NOT Received,Although it is over a month since I ordered this book I did not receive it.The seller is a cheat.
2,A long ways from Cryptonomicon and Snow Crash,"Slogging through the first 600 pages of this book, I kept wondering where the creativity apparent in his earlier work had gone. Occasional flashes of classic Stephenson (science mixed with history mixed with humor) do show up from time to time, but it's not until you've invested several reading sessions that the book starts to pick up the pace. Only the most dedicated fans will make it to Book Two ""The Confusion"" due out later this year. However, having had a chance to read an ARC of said book, I will say that if you put your time into the lackluster book one, the second one is more rewarding.If you don't have time to read doorstoppers like this, and are looking for one book rather than three, pick up Iain Pears' ""An Instance of the Fingerpost."" Quicksilver just doesn't hold up to work such as this (or ""In the Name of the Rose"" for that matter.)"
3,Cryptonomicon 2,"It's difficult to rate this book. Neal Stephenson really know how to write and make long stories interesiting. Enjoyed selveral of his other books, but this time the story changed from mostly fun with some boring parts to being mostly boring with some great sections.Quicksilver reminds me a lot about Cryptonomicon, even if the setting is 300 years earlier. The characters are similar, not necessarily bad, but it contribute to the overall ""too boring"" impression. Also, long extremely detailed descriptions make parts of the book tip the overall impression from great to OK.So, what worked really well in Cryptonomicon barely work here, hope the next one is better. Maybe he'll let an editor look at it before publising next time."
2,Quicksilver - boring and hard to follow,"Quicksilver is much less entertaining then other Neal Stephenson's writings. For instance, I thoroughly enjoyed Cryptonicon,Readm and The Diamond Age. Cryptonicon, particularly the audio book (I have read the book and listened to the audio version) is far more interesting and enjoyable. Quicksilver is confusing and seems (I haven't quite finished reading it) seems to be simply wandering about the 17th century is some sort of ""phantastical"" manner. I would not recommend purchasing this book unless you are a complete die-hard Neal Stephenson fan and then, be forewarned, you are purchasing a book which seems to mingle fact with fiction in a most confusing way."
1,Why you should NOT start on this trilogy,"I broke my own rule (***Avoid ALL trilogies***) because I loved all of Neal Stephenson's other books. And I regret it!The first third of Quicksilver was interesting, if you like scientific / historical trivia. The other 2/3 of the book was boring / painful to read. I found it far less compelling than most SF that I read.I have NO interest in reading the other two novels in the series. Take a look at other people's reviews for the THIRD volume in the series. Many found the payoff underwhelming after reading all 2,700 pages."
1,Glad I read the reviews before wasting time...,"I'm partway through this book and am already so disappointed and frustrated that I decided to check the reviews online to see if it was worth persevering. There are a lot of bad reviews so I'm guessing it's not just me. I'm a big fan of all Stephensons other books but this is very tedious. You know the feeling when you are watching a great movie when you are engrossed in the story as opposed to when you very aware of the acting and are dissecting it rather than been fully engaged...this book feels like a bad movie.You keep hoping it will improve but the author tries too hard to be clever and the references to Cryptonomicon all the time are like having pop-up ads appear every few minutes. Put down the keyboard, take up a backpack and try to get back down to earth Neal. I think fame has taken it's toll."
3,A bit repetitive,"The concept of the characters is good and the storyline engaging but somewhat repetitive. This partly due to the actual story (running from or attacking the Simians throughout the book) but what became pretty annoying was reading every part of the story TWICE. Once from Levi's point of view, once from Amy's. This was useful and interesting initially but got old really fast for me."
2,Extreme amount of profanity! Ick.,"Call me naive, but I like to think of my dogs as the innocent creatures they are. If my dogs could speak to me, I would be HORRIFIED beyond belief if they were to say such disgusting things like the author has the dogs saying in her book.The book caught my attention and I did finish it within a few days (hence 2 stars), however I found myself constantly frustrated (and just plain disgusted) at her portrayal of what goes on inside a dog's head.Not only that, but I found the main character to be so lazy, filthy-mouthed, ungrateful, ever-unsatisfied, and sleezy - that it disgusted me as well.I did enjoy how much she adored her dog, and other dogs in general. She had a few cute insights to a dog's way of thinking, but wrecked it with all the icky parts.Not a great book, if I could take back reading it, I would."
2,Nothing special,"Whiny main character Dawn is obsessed with herself throughout. Dawn's friends and family are not so much developed as they are described, which is mostly accomplished through relating their ""quirky! funny!"" tics. The author seems to be from the ever-more-popular school of thought that painting goofy stereograms on top of these flat people makes them three-dimensional. Nutty mom, insincere boyfriend, controlling sister, womanizer dad. You've already seen all these characters ad nauseum.I kept wondering if I was really supposed to sympathize with Dawn, a woman the author desperately wants us to believe is just down on her luck or repressed or gullible, blah blah. But its written so ham-handedly that Dawn just comes off as a moron. Whatever twists happen are obvious, simply because no effort was put into their execution.Chuck, the dog, is fun. Briefly.Recommended for teenage girls; materialistic, self-centered, intermittently single women; and fans of dog sweaters."
1,I hope dogs don't really talk like that,"Like many of the other dog loving reviewers before me, I was hoping for a good read here. What a disappointment! The profanity from both dogs and humans was a real turn-off. If my dogs talked like that, I'd wash their mouths out with soap. Didn't finish, only read 70 pages, so I don't know if a story line ever developed or not. Waste of money and bigger waste of time."
3,Boing and not very funny either,"I love stories about dogs and i really thought this would be something I would enjoy, but although she did get the dogs behavior down pat, I found it to be rather boring and instead of funny, just mildly amusing. Ho hum, so she can't get her head on straight...whatever."
3,The TALKING DOGS got the book an extra star,"Another dysfunctional family that makes the reader appreciate their own family - in the story these characters love each other!When the dogs started talking the book took on new voices (literally!) I really liked the idea that her dog was able to ""take in"" a person much better than she was.There was only one part I found unforgivable by the author - page 261 ""took the dogs to the pound."" She must have enjoyed writing that - but I almost threw the book off the wall at that point. (Talk about getting your reader involved!)Liked the idea tho of the dogs knowing much more than the people and looking at issues in a different light."
5,Excellent,This is one of the best books I have read in a while. Easy reading and if you have pets you can totally relate!! I laughed often throughout this book!
5,This story was so much FUN!,"I promise you will never think of your dog as a dog ever again. You will always wonder if he is, in fact, the guru of the dog park!"
1,I wasted my money,"Unfortunately, I wasted my money on this book....I reached page 160 out of 270 and could not bear to go on. The profanity was bad but then when they story mentions oral sex and other interesting situations it became too much. I lost track of how many times the 'f' word was used and even the dogs used profanity. I now believe in book ratings being placed on every book so that customers can know what they are spending their money on."
5,Great options and performance,"I'm using this drive for audio recording, back up and also transferring files from compact flash cards onto an old computer. I'm able to back up all of the computers in my house on one drive. For audio applications the firewire delivers. I can run multitrack recordings with several audio tracks and plugins without even a stutter from the drive. It's a keeper."
3,Great product but Mac Users should note,"I originally gave this product three stars, I should have given it minus one. The firewire interface just doesn't work with my Mac. The software crashes. I am returning it. Caveat Emptor.The drive seems great, and the idea of combining a card reader with a removable drive is very nice. I got this unit to work with my new Mac Pro. Mac users should note, if you are planning to connect the drive via Firewire to take advantage of the USB hub and cardreader you also need to connect the USB wire. I agree with the comment that the software is impossible. Instructions are terrible, and the version on the disk crashed. Downloading updated software and drivers helped, but it was non-trivial finding the right ones, Dantz has been purchased by EMC, there's a Reflection and Reflection Express, in versions 6.0 and 6.1, you get the idea. I still don't have the software working right. Probably not this level of pain on Windows..."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this because pillow because it is IDENTICAL to a pillow that was given to me, brand new, for my neck pain. The gift pillow was great for my neck and relieved the pain. It maintained its shape for over a year. This pillow, however, lost its MEMORY after a couple of days. I am so disappointed. Hopefully I can locate the other pillow!"
1,Victoria,"I did not read the info before ordering. HoMedics is a good company and I am very familiar with some of their products so when I saw what I needed I ordered it. I received half moon pillow and it was so small. I needed this to put under my kneees when using heat on my back, thinking I was getting something like they use at physical therapy and it looks the same but is miniature."
3,The product I received was a different shape,"I loved this, so I ordered another one, and the shape was not as pictured, but slanted to the high point in a flat curve. I like the product but not the shape."
3,Support Pillow,I bought the pillow to put under my knees when I sleep. It works well but tends to flatten out the longer you lay on it. Would be better if the memory foam was firmer.
4,Good pillow for lumbar support,Good pillow for lumbar support. It seemed to work for me sitting at my work computer desk. It gives you sufficient lumbar support to help reduce back strain while sitting at your desk.
1,NO STARS! REALLY.,"Four Inspiring Novels my backside. I didn't have the option of no stars so I had to give it a 1. This book goes nowhere fast. They certainly are not INSPIRING!!! The writing is barely tolerable and the story lines are all so similar you wonder how this writer got published. I had to force myself to read them because I purchased this ill printed garbage. If you want to read good Amish fiction get one of Beverly Lewis' books, and leave Ms. Brunstetter's on the shelf."
2,it's OK,"It's not loud at all when it rings. I also don't trust the exact timing because there are no clear markings to line up the numbers. It's cute, though."
1,waste of money,Was very disapponted with this book. The cd Rom you cannot see your choices for ans. So it was very very frustating. When i purchased this book I wanted to be able to use the cd rom. It is of no use. How can you make a choice if you cannot see the choices. Now I have to go out and purchase another brand to help me with my review. If There is any way I could get a refund I would. Will never Ever by any of their products again.
1,This can't be a NEW book?,"I looked at the copyright page more than once! I couldn't believe this book was written in 2004. So muddled, so confused and so uninteresting. Hard to believe that Elizabeth Thornton, one of my favorite authors, actually put her name on it after writing much steamier, involved, intricate books. What happened here? Actually, I didn't much care."
2,Goofy defect and poor support unless you pay extra for it.,"For the most part, Partition Magic does the basic functions for which it's designed. I used it primarily to change cluster size on my NTFS file system. The scary part is that they only offer support through a form you fill out on their website and, in my experience, they don't bother to reply to that. Since it's not a real e-mail address, you don't even have a record of your original message. There is phone support if you want to pay $30 more ($95 after hours).If your interest is in their DataKeeper program (included with Partition Magic), you should know that when you use it to backup file systems other than your C drive, it will also monitor your C drive whether you want it to or not. This can slow down your system considerably if it starts backing up system files which are constantly changing.In general, Partition Magic is great if you don't run into any problems, but Data Keeper, as simple as it is, still needs work."
3,I like the one by yahiya emerick more,"I got this one about a year ago with high hopes. I've been looking for a good english trans. for some time. I was at a friends house and he had a new translation on his desk. It was called a journey through the holy quran and it was by yahiya emerick. I started thumbing through it and could not put it down. the flow was incredible and he explains the reasons for revelation and gives the info on all the obscure references. if you want to read a qur'an in english that gets it right, finally gets it right, check out that one. This one by haleem is okay, but it still reads choppy and makes me feel that the writer doesn't have the rhythms of english down pat.A Journey through the Holy Qur'an"
4,"Soothing, but not great for oily skin/hair","I have thick, healthy, naturally curly hair that can be smoothed with some product and styling. This shampoo would be excellent for ""soothing"" overworked, overstyled, dry hair. The first time I used it, I could feel my hair almost relax and soften while lathering, though my hair is not damaged. Upon the recommendation of a stylist, I decided to try it to see if it would smooth my frizzy waves. It has argon oil, and I imagine that this product would be fabulous for those with very coarse or damaged hair.The only drawback was that after a few days of using both the shampoo and conditioner, my hair felt VERY oily. I usually wash every other day, and this made my scalp more oily and uncomfortable. If I used it, I would probably have to wash every day. If you have oily skin or scalp, this may not be for you. Try a sample or small bottle and see if it works with your hair/skin type."
4,"Good, but not Great","Yes, Panama would have been a better choice, but what happened to ""Rock and Roll Party in the Streets"" The best cover of that song EVER!"
4,Only an appetizer,"Reading the title of this disc and then taking a quick scan over the track listing begs the question ""So when is volume 2 going to be released?"". Namely because there is no ""(Oh) Pretty Woman"", no ""Everybody Wants Some"" no ""You Really Got Me"", no ""Where Have All The Good Times Gone"" in fact no Diver Down album tracks period. In fairness, it IS a daunting task trying to cram all the David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar hits onto one disc and the argument could be made that each lineup deserved it's own separate volume. Given what we have here, however, I think most fans would have sacrificed the two new songs recorded with David Lee Roth in favor of a more comprehensive collection. This album will whet your appetite for Van Halen but will in no way satisfy it given the songs omitted."
4,Track 15-Humans Being,"This is the sole reason to buy this cd. Humans Being (also on the Twister STD) is one of the BEST Van Halen songs ever recorded. A sober Eddie just shredding the guitar on that song is a thing of beauty. Too bad they broke up and us fans never really got a chance to see that song live (with Sammy on vocals).As for the rest of the CD it is hit and miss. I personally wish they would have included some more tracks and made it a double disc. However, the songs that they did include are classic Van Halen songs. You will not be disappointed purchasing this CD, you just might find yourself wanting more."
3,Worth it....,"...but only for the last three tracks. ""Humans Being"" is undoubtably the best Van Halen song ever (even if it is a Hagar song)--this track is a masterpiece.""Can't Get This Stuff No More"" and ""Me Wise Magic"" are the results of the month long DLR/VH reunion. The general concensus is that these two tracks are subpar, though I'm in the minority that actually likes them. The tracks are mello and restrained, with a very distinct Blues influence. Definately a different sound from early VH, but not at all bad."
4,Van Halen's Best,"This is a good CD and its the only Greatest Hits one out (at the time that this was written) so I had to get it. It has all the hits like ""Jump"" and ""Why can't this be Love."" It also has the guitar solo ""Eruption,"" but does not have ""You Really Got Me"" afterwards which is a disappointment. It is also missing ""Jaine's Crying"" and ""Hot for Teacher."" Other than that it's got everything, so I would recommend this for and Van Halen fan. (Anyone who doesn't know that many Van Halen songs, look for cut 3, ""Running with the Devil"" because this is the best song on the disc.)"
4,Decent intro to VH,"Most, if not all Van Halen is good... if not great (not including 1998's Van Halen ""III"" featuring Extreme's Gary Cherone... yuck). This ""Vol. 1"" is a good intro to the band, but like so many other reviews here... there needs to be a 2nd disc. One disc should cover the span with David Lee Roth and should include at least some of the following songs ""Jamie's Cryin'"", ""Bottoms Up"", ""Beautiful Girls"", ""Light Up The Sky"", ""Mean Street"", ""So This Is Love"", ""Everybody Wants Some"", ""I'll Wait"", and last but not least ""Secrets"" and ""Little Guitars"" from DIVER DOWN - even tho one of VH's weaker releases, it still should have been represented on this ""Vol. 1"" collection. The other disc should cover the Sammy Hagar era and add a few more choice tunes like ""Runaround"", ""Cabo Wabo"", ""Finish What Ya Started"", ""Seventh Seal"" and ""Black & Blue"". Again, good first volume... the hits are here and deservedly so. But it could have been more complete with a 2nd disc."
3,Not quite the best of.,I have to be honest and say that I am a pre-Sammy Hagar Van Halen fan. None of his tracks are that good in comparison to the Roth era. This album would have been better if it had concentrated sole on the roth era and then the Secong best of concentrated on the Van Hagar era. So 3 stars cause for all the cr*p tracks by Hagar.
5,Great CD!!!,I just love Van Halen's music. I bought this because it has GREAT SONGS on this. If you love Van Halen and you dont have this then I suggest you get it. Not a bad song on it.
3,A Spectrum covering the Very Best through the Very Worst,"While Van Halen's DLR songs are very good, the 1985 switch to Sammy Hagar was a disaster. The mediocre musical performance by the band during this time, coupled with the worse than mediocre singing of Hagar made for amazingly bad albums. The first 9 tracks of this compilation, while not all DLR's best, nonetheless make very enjoyable listening, and are an excellent, if small, showcase of their varied talents . The remaining tracks are generally worthless, and even DLR's return in the last three tracks reveals him as an old cocaine-addict with no vocal talent remaining whatsoever."
5,The best ever,"This is the best cd you can find of any music like it. Eddie is the best guitar player in the world. IF you like one of their songs this is the cd to get it rocks. I would also get Def Lepard that are awesome too. Would not recommend their new cd called ""Van Halen 3"" it has one or two good songs on it but that is all."
5,Pretty Good Best of,Hard to do a Best of for a band that has been around so long and has had multiple lead singers. This best of certainly covers most of of their better songs. I am a big fan of Me Wise Magic and wish they had come up with a bunch of new songs to sing with Dave.
3,Dave's great-- Less Sammy!!,"This is an greatest hits package that adequately represents VH's first 20 years. However, the absence of such tracks as You Really Got Me, Jamie's Cryin', Beautiful Girls (""I love 'em!! I need 'em!!), Everybody Wants Some!, Dirty Movies, and Hot for Teacher has encouraged me to get some of the original albums. Obviously I prefer the Dave years to the Van Hagar era (Eddie played better riffs back then), but even some of his best songs are not here (Runaround, Finish What You Started). Overall, a decent place to start your VH collection, but not to complete it. By the way, the new Dave track, Me Wise Magic is fantastic."
3,Might As Well Jump past this one.,"Van Halen really should have done the double disc method with this one. One for Sam and one for Dave. They left out too many songs. The new Dave songs, I am still on the fence about. I like ""Me Wise Magic"", and ""Can't Get This Stuff No More"" is OK, but the music still has the Sammy-era twinge to them. (I believe one tune is a left over from Balance) I do wish Dave had come back for good, but now that I think about it, maybe that magic only lies within the brief period from '78 to '84. Eddie's writing has changed too much, and Dave looks really old. I felt they could have chosen better Sammy songs, but it will be interesting to see what Volume II will offer. Maybe more new Roth songs (I wish!)."
3,DON'T expect much (Misleading title - NOT ACCEPTING MP4 FILE FORMAT),"This is definitely not a MP4 player. It only accepts AMV, which is a Chinese version of video files. It takes approximately 20 min to convert a AVI file to AMV format. Plus, the resolution for the display screen is 190x120 maximum. After 15 minutes looking at that screen, you are guaranteed to have watery eyes. My player even have another problem, I must tilt the screen to be able to to see the correct picture (20 degrees tilt). The control is not easy to figure out and cause a bit of inconvenient because buttons are too small and on the wrong side for a right-handed person. This is a cheap MP3 player, so DON'T expect much from it."
4,Good Buy. You'll enjoy.,There really isn't a way to escape the time commitment required to put any system together. My advice is to take your time and read through several steps ahead so you have a better idea how each section fits together since there were few occasions where I had to redo something because the instructions weren't clear enough. It took me 4 hours spread out over the weekend which made the entire process more digestible. Just remind yourself that you're going to get more out of the product than the initial investment of time building it.
1,"Great in the past, but seem to be going downhill fast.",I have purchased several of these Western Digital external hard drives in the past and was very happy with them. This latest unit has a fully depressed on/off button and will not turn on. Very poor quality over all when compared with similar drives only a year older. Seems like this one was made in a different factory where it was thrown together by clueless workers who didn't care about the quality of their workmanship. I am hoping that the new My Book models from WD will be better made.
1,Bad Support,"WD will not support your hard drive WHEN it fails. On November 16, 2004, I bought a 250GB hard drive. Three months later in February, 2005, I had to return it for a replacement due to a hard failure. Now, this replacement drive too has failed as well after only eight months.I went through two WD drives in a year due to no fault of my own and the hard drive failed just six days after the warranty expiration. I requested a replacement from Western Digital and they completely ignored me.Buy at your own risk."
4,"works great, and TAD works even if not connected directly","Despite dramatic language in the manual to the contrary, this unit works fine for me with the telephone answering machine on a different floor. In fact, I've owned brother mfc's for 10 years,in two different residences, and they always work fine in TAD mode without it connected directly. I e-mailed brother, and they said that they are aware will work in this configuration, but some may have problems, so they won't guarantee it. Very strange."
4,Works well; a little power heavy and document feeder a bit quirky,"I like this printer. It does what it is supposed to do with minimal fuss. It is MUCH better than the Dell product, which I started with and sent back. I have not had any problems with the document tray or paper curl and the unit was very easy to set up and use. The network connectivity is great if you have more than one computer.My two issues: (1) while printing and while the fan is running, it draws so much power that it causes some lights to flicker a little bit. This was a problem with our old laser, too, so maybe it is just a wiring issue in our house. (2) the document feeder can be a little quirky. It jams a little more than it should."
1,Don't buy this product,"This product does not work properly. Unsupervised, the sheet feeder will almost always cause a paper jam.After four and a half months of light use, a message appeared saying ""Back cover open"", even though the back cover is closed. Because of this error message, the machine doesn't work any more. I am attempting to find a replacement.The machine works well otherwise, but there are many other printers that are far more efficient and reliable. Don't let favourable reviews fool you. There are basic design faults on this machine."
3,wrong toner cartridge,"Message I sent to amazon.The toner cartridge tn460 was ordered with the brother mfc-7820n printer as recommended on your site. The toner cartridge does not fit in, nor was it made for this printer. I bought this for resale and i now have one pissed off customer and a worthless cartridge that had to be opened in order to find out it isn't made for this printer."
2,Great MultiFunction BUT blows out my fuses,"I have had this all in one and have really really liked it, however it uses 460w when starting up or copying or doing just about anything and that is too much for my house wiring. We got constant light flickering and if it was printing and you ran another power hog then it would trip the breaker. Brother would not help.....it is really a shame since this unit really does everything it says and fast (the fuser takes all that power to heat up). If you have a new house then you should have no problem, I am afraid I had to return mine."
1,I really wanted this one to work!!!,"Five weeks into owning the Brother MFC-7820N, it started reducing all of my work by 40% and printing a large black margin down the side of EVERYTHING! Brother Customer Support said that ""it isn't supposed to do that after just 5 weeks,"" which makes me wonder, when IS it supposed to do that? They are sending out a replacement printer in two to three days. To be continued..."
2,A Univers that has a lot to proove,"I bought the DVD and watched the first ten episodes and was very sickened by what I saw at first. I hated Dr Rush and thougth that Eli was the best character of the show and it left me hanging. I am waiting on the FULL series so I can watch it and decide if it is in the same league as SG-1 and SGA. Those series put the military in a good light, but this series makes the military out fo be a bunch of mean selfish people. Oh well."
1,This should not be called Stargate. . .,"This is the worst edition of stargate, and I have to be blunt, it is an embarrassment to the stargate franchise. This is in no way family friendly. The jokes are non existent, unlike SG1 and Atlantis. The plot line had a sex scene in at least every other episode, and most of the characters did not seem to have any morals by the end of the show.BRING BACK SG1 and ATLANTIS!"
2,Eject this show out the airlock,Not:CleverOriginalEnjoyableStargateIs:ClichéPredictableEmptySoap opera
2,Has Potential,"The problem with this show is that it is more of a character drama than a science fiction show which is one reason why the old stargate fan base is leaving. The primary focus of the show should be exploring the Universe and not character development. I mean the show is called, Stargate Universe. Lets please explore the Universe. I'm not saying there shouldn't be any character development I just think chraracter developement should be made secondary. Also it dosen't help that many of the characters are very unlikable almost to the point of being irredeemable but I still think many of the characters can reform themselves like this show still can. I hope the second half of this season and season 2 will be better."
1,No Stars In This Gate,"Like many respondents I too have been an avid Stargate Fan since the original movie, I own every episode from the original series, and every episode from the Atlantis series. I was a little slow in adopting Atlantis, but I was eventually absorbed into the wonderful story. But this abomination doesn't deserve the honor of wearing the moniker...""Staqrgate"". It's populated with unlikeable, small characters. No heroes exist in this dark, drab,selfish, posturing, confusing world. Where are the adults!? even those over 30 yrs old behave like selfish, bickering adolescents. What a pitiful waste and a terrible disgrace to the memories of, Jack, Sam, Teal'c, Gen. Hammond, the citizens of Tulac and all the collective Goa'uld. Please gate to anywhere off my TV and remain there."
1,Misleading Title!!! This is not Season One!,"This is only HALF of the first season. The title of this item says ""Stargate SG-U: Season One (2009)"" But later down in the Editorial review it states that it's a three disc set that will include 10 episodes from Season 1.Season 1 will have 20 episodes in it and this DVD set is set for release in Feb 2010, before all 20 episodes of the first season have even aired on TV.Please let them know you want full seasons and not half seasons on DVD by not purchasing this.I cant really write a review of season one yet because it's not done airing but from what little we've seen so far it looks promising. I'm looking forward to the rest of the season and hopefully the entire season on one reasonably priced dvd set.This halfseason release is an insult to Stargate fansPost Season 1 Edit: Looks like they listened to angry fans, or who knows maybe it was their plan all along, but they released the entire season on DVD and it's available for less than $40 here on Amazon."
3,Too much for too little,"I really wish studios would stop this obnoxious habit of releasing ""half"" seasons at full price. Yeah, I can understand that this release will tide fans over until the series resumes in 2010, but $70 for 10 episodes on the Blu-ray is excessive. And of course there's always the possibility that there will be a full season set released at some point for a double-dip later on. Some credit is due for including high-res audio.As far as the series is concerned, it has possibilities, but I struggle to find any of the characters likable (except for Eli, who's clearly there to appeal to the nerd herd) and the stories have little action of consequence. The show is suffering an identity crisis as it doesn't know whether to be Battlestar Galactica (big shoes to fill) or a soap opera.I think I'll sit this one out for the moment and see what happens next!"
1,Please do not buy this!,"Why do these studios keep trying to rip us off? This is half of a season, so to get the whole season you have to make two purchases. That is stupid, so please do not support there decision to rob us."
1,The Death of the Stargate Series?,"The first episode of SG-U, like all the other episodes, seems to be nothing more than an extended wallow in individual and group angst. Where have all our make-it-happen Stargate heroes gone? My entire family has loved all the SGs until now, but we stopped watching SG-U after about the 4th episode. None of us care what happens to the crybabies. Perhaps SG-U stands for StarGate Unwatchable?"
2,"Great Series, Stupid Price","Stargate SG-U: Season One [Blu-ray]There has been a lot of buzz around Stargate Universe. Some really like it, some really really hate it. I'm one of those people who has been really enjoying the show. Some say it's too slow, which is understandable. Not alot has happened in the 9 episodes that have aired. But other than that, I think the show has been pretty enjoyable so far.Extras for the recently announced Blu-Ray will include the Behind the scenes videos that have been avalible on SGU's website as well as audio commentaries for all 9 episodes. [...].Now my major problem with this: Not only are they splitting the season up into two parts, but for only nine episodes, it carries a ridiculously high price point. I could understand the [...] price tag if it was for the whole season, but not for nine episodes. For three or four dollars less, I can get 24 episodes of 24's seventh season, and that's on Blu-Ray too. I really wish MGM would come to their senses."
1,Perhaps if you paid ME,"I might watch this, otherwise words cannot express the horror of what this show has done to a terrific franchise.Now give us the Atlantis movie and the SG1 movie and I'll be the first in line to order."
1,Disappointing SG show,"This show is nothing like the other Stargate shows. Its so BORING! Every show is essentially the same plot: the crew is hopelessly stuck in space and about to DIE! The characters are annoying, particularly Dr. Rush. I wish they'd kept Atlantis going."
2,Be Careful,"It took a while to become an SG-1 fan. Season 4 I got hooked and bought all 10 seasons and the movies.SG-Atlantis started out well, hit a rough patch but turned out to be fun while it lasted.SG-U has turned out to be a 10 episode pilot. Before you ask me to pay twenty-some dollars show me something more: like a full season.The BSG formula will not work with this one because the plot (if there is one) has not developed enough to keep fans interested.Is it just me or does SyFy like strangling series with a fan base? They choked off B-5. They never let Crusade get started even though it showed a lot of promise and they P-O'd the BSG fans by double charging. It seems as if SyFy is testing the waters before they commit. With so many other things to capture fans' interest they would have been better served seizing the momentum of the other two series by airing a full season and a 4 month gap between half seasons is not the way to do it."
3,I have seen every Stargate episode in existence... ROCKY START.,"I only give it two stars because #1 It's Stargate (just barely) and #2 I like a couple of the characters.. But the rest piss me off. I would write a long review about why this show is sucking, but everybody else here has it covered. Basically, it's like a soap opera with annoying characters but better acting.Producers, heed the audience. PLEASE.EDIT/UPDATE: I changed my rating of this one from 2 stars to 3 after the season finished because it got better. Stargate Universe Redeemed itself in the second part of the first season. Then, the second season became one of the best Stargate seasons, period. It's better than Atlantis and as good as some of SG-1. It really turned out to be very, very interesting and good. Even my wife started watching it with me (she never liked any Stargates)... and we were so freakin bummed it got cancelled."
1,Unbelievable,"I have watched every single stargate there is to watch.Most of them several times.SGU Season 1, the HALF of it that actually has aired, I only watch because it is Stargate and I keep hoping that it will suddenly live up to the franchise.Maybe it will get better, I am willing to keep giving it a chance, but no way am I going to pay $27 for half a season that I so far do not find very interesting."
1,What have they done!!!,"I am trying so hard to like this show because it is part of the Stargate franchise, but no matter how hard I try the show seems to be going from bad to worse. It is nothing like SG-1 or Atlantis, it is more like BSG with a twist of LOST. There is no real story line, all they seem to do is argue and talk to the Kino which is really annoying. The whole feel of the series is nothing like Stargate, I am very disappointed that Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping and Richard Dean Anderson have appeared in episodes. After the terrific work they have done in the previous series this must be a huge let down for them. I hope they don't go any further with the show. Take it away now before they kill the Stargate name."
1,Disappointed,"Wow - I was all set to purchase this series (even though it was only half a season) until I read the reviews. I am an avid Stargate Fan and cannot believe it has ended like this..... Needless to say, I will not be purchasing this based on the 83 horrible reviews that it did receive and the trailer which looked completely boring and dark."
2,Not like the rest of the SGU,"I love the everything Stargate I'm a huge fan. I own all the SG-1 and Atlantis seasons. This however is more like Battelstar Galactica, as in it's made to look like a home movie. I hate those. It also has more drama in it than Gerneral Hospital. It has the potential to be so much more and is the reason I will keep watching it when it comes back on-its a very short two part MINI series. Allthough if it's still directed in the home movie mannor I would be able to take it long."
3,Good compilation,"I really am just writing this to clarify that the song titled ""Whatcha Gonna Do?"" (#12) that is listed as DMX is NOT DMX... any hip hop fan can tell you that this is Jayo Felony. How that got confused, I have no idea. That being said, this is a good compilation for starting with late 90's hip hop."
2,Weak copy,"I was a huge fan of the excellent BBC version of Life on Mars, and was looking forward to the ABC series.I will use the words of Stephen King to illustrate my thoughts: ""I wish an American network would run the British Life on Mars, one of the greatest limited-run (16 episodes) television series I've ever seen -- it shuts the American version down completely.""The difference is night and day, the American version was decent, but the BBC version is comparable, and in my opinion superior, to shows like Dexter, Mad Men, and Weeds.Even at the low price of $15, you'd be better off saving for the original BBC version finally available on DVD on amazon."
1,Triumph of high priced mediocrity,"Don't be mislead by those similarly-worded disingenuous rave reviews. While this is not the worst calculus book out there, it is certainly not in the top twenty percent. So if your instructor requires this book for your course you may still do OK.However if you are an autodidact or if your instructor is flexible in the choice of textbooks, I have a suggestion. The best calculus book money can buy is FREE. In fact, the University of Wisconsin offers a free download of H Jerome Keisler's calculus textbook. Do a google search using keywords 'Keisler' and 'calculus' to locate the site.I don't think you will find a better calculus book. And you certainly won't find a better one for free."
1,Terribly Incoherent,"I am really surprised with all the excellent reviews this book received. In fact, it almost seems like they are all written by the author's friends. I totally disagree with this book being ""the best book ever written""; it's more like the most digressive and confusing presentation of beginner analysis. The author seems to throw in these weird words which, after looking in a thesaurus, turn out to be common words. It's almost like he wants to confuse people on purpose! Set theory and metric spaces are NOT covered at all, and the book is full of unnecessary ""philosophical remarks"" -- as the author himself refers to them. By the way, after one is done reading a chapter, and deciphering rambling sentences, one gets a shot at the IMPOSSIBLE problems (most almost totally unrelated with the chapter); so might as well not read the book and just struggle with the problems.Totally not recommended!!! Especially for beginners."
5,A religious experience,"I've only read the first chapter of this book, but it's been completely fantastic so far. In just one chapter, Spivak's dispatched many of the nagging questions that I'd had about basic mathematics (Why exactly is 1/0 undefined?)To some of the negative reviewers, this book has to be read in the right ""frame of mind."" I made several false starts before it ""clicked.""I recommend reading ""Lockhart's Lament"" before reading this book. Lockhart's Lament is available freely from the AMA. That's what helped me understand what Spivak was doing and why all of the really dumb seeming basic questions were actually important.Not a book to skim. Consider yourself warned."
1,Coby players,"I did not purchase this unit, but I had recently purchased a similar Coby 20gb player over the internet. I received the unit not working, and after hassling with the company that I purchased it from, I returned it to Coby directly. After months of waiting for a replacement, that one didn't work either. It was a beautiful product, but the packageing did not make the machine work. I never got Coby to return phone calls to return the second unit. I will not purchase any Coby product again.Buyer beware!!!"
1,music man,Once again you get duped because this is not the music from the 60s. Wish the people selling this material would be honest enough to let you know when it is a remake.
2,Just the basics,"I liked the outlook of this books, how to see your potential. But it falls short of that, it's just a basic astrology book. It focuses on sun signs for predicting careers, I just don't think that's deep enough."
4,Interesting,"Although not quite what I expected, this book was far from being a disappointment. It is not solely focused on women dressed as angels, it is mainly an erotic Fantasy Photography book. 9 photographers from North-central europe are featured, with more than 10 photographs from each. Styles differ, from body-painting (for a comic-book effect) to completely photoshopped settings and landscapes, to a contortionist/dancer - but always the theme remains, the female in ways you probably have not seen before."
5,Not what I expected..,".. but so much more!I don't like all of the works in this gallery, some even make me skip pages, but it doesn't matter. The idea behind these pictures is still very strong and everyone has a different taste, so why not. But still, the book is so much more than I expected. The photos are all really impressive works of art. Some need alot of time untill you can get the whole idea, others are just gorgeous with a touch of some kind of sweet fetish.I totally recommend this to nude photography lovers!"
5,Excellent Ulster County Behind The Scenes History,"I moved to Ulster County in the early 70's, and still live 1/2 mile from the old Hurley State Police barracks where Investigator Beyea was stationed. He's an excellent writer, and I can remember many of the cases described in his book from newspaper accounts at the time. Also, he was able to use the actual names of many people I knew, changing others when appropriate. I look forward to purchasing more of his books!"
4,"Light weight, super fast shipping","I first want to thank Amazon for offering this product with APO shipping! I live overseas with the military and we've had nothing but trouble tring to get our baby gear (it's our first, so we have aboslutely nothing to start with). Secondly, I must thank the other reviewers - especially those who've had this mattress for a while or are purchasing 2nd and 3rd ones. Thank you for sharing your feedback!I've only had the mattress for a few days and we're still waiting for the baby to arrive, so we've not put it to use yet, but Amazon was able to ship the item to our APO box in about six days! And the mattress was so very light I had no trouble moving it around myself (at 9 mos. pregnant). It fit perfectly and snugly into our Million Dollar Baby (Da Vinci) ""Kalani"" crib. The square shape left no gaps. I expect it to be easy to change sheets due to the lightness of the mattress. I will be recommending this to any of my friends."
5,Great!,This mattress is just as advertised. It is a little hard but put the mattress pad on and it will be perfect!
5,great baby mattress,"I purchased a baby mattress for my grandson, it was delivered promptly. The mattress is excellent, the customer service was exceptional! I would highly recommend this mattress and Colgate products."
1,"At least they got the title right, if that's worth anything","Oh God, what were they thinking. This game was BAD, not bad good, but good and bad. At nine dollars this game is priced too high. The graphics where nominal, the game play was dumb, the AI (in this case All Idiotic) was none existant. Hardcore fans of the movie were suckered into paying 50 dollars when this first came out. The only place that you'll see Martin Lawerance or Will Smith's images is on the box, that's it. Nor do they use their voices in the game, I figured that they both had made bad career moves in the past that almost cost them everything, so they didn't want to take that chance again. All in all, I'd place this game up (or down) there with such videogame marvels as Aquaman and Superman Akropolis. Save the nine bucks for a six pack or something."
3,Don't read before you visit Prague,"I started reading in preparation for long anticipated trip to Prague. I gave up about half way through before I was completely cured of my desire to visit the magic city. Demetz's goal is to demystify ""Praga Magica"" and he succeeds. This isn't to say that the book isn't entertaining, interesting and often fascinating, but you'd better bone up on the Reformation, Counter Reformation and various wars of Austrian Succession, or you'll find some chapters as dense and confusing as the labrynthian streets of the Old Town. And the long Latin and Czech citations don't help. To be on he Charles Bridge as night falls and sdee all the steeples and turrets of Prague in their golden aura is too marvelous a rush. Skip Prague in Black and Gold until you come back. It will deepen your appreciation of the magic you have experienced."
2,"A little gold, but I was mostly in the dark","As other reviewers have noted, this book is difficult to peg and, sometimes, to follow. As a (sort of) history book written by a literature professor, this is not surprising. The subtitle, ""Scenes from the Life"", is apt; while there are plenty of anecdotal gems, it doesn't provide a systematic and comprehensive overview of the city's history nor put it into a larger context. The strongest parts are those describing the occasional cooperations, but more frequent tensions, between Prague's Germans, Czechs, and Jews. Often billed as a tourist's introduction to the city, Demetz spends long sections on some pretty arcane literary history without really telling the layperson why he should care. There is an irony here too, since the last section is a 10-page, somewhat self-indulgent, gripe about how the city has been ruined, largely by tourists. If you are planning a trip to Prague and want to know more about the city, I think you can do better."
4,Prague in Black and Gold,"Very solid chronicle of the history of Prague. Slightly monotonous at times, but each chapter works to capture the true essence and motivations behind each era of central Europe's past."
5,AMAZING,Amazing footage and educational. Image shakes a bit on camera pans likely due to PAL to NTSC trasnfer. Still give it a 5 star rating.
1,Extremely poor audio!,"Audio narration is barely audible, background sounds and music over ride the narration! Difficult to read and/or use programming! Will definitely not purchase BBC films again!"
5,A holiday smile-maker,"Adorable and nostalgic. Fun to color, especially with kids (I even had fun with my OWN box of Crayolas! I'm a big kid. hahaha!)."
3,"A short, adequate review","In a very short introduction it is often hard to get much done. Cook here succeeds in giving some basic interpretations on significant verses in the Koran - the famous ""sword verses"", balanced against the verse that there should be no compulsion in Islam. He also dwells (perhaps too much) on the verse reviewing God's curse on Israeli fishermen who violated the Sabbath (that allegedly turned them into apes). Some reference to how Muslims themselves interpret the Koran is made. A reader already initiated in the study of Islam or the Koran might appreciate this more than the novice - as Cook dwells considerably on language and translation issues. The final section discusses possible theories of the formation of the Koran (as well as some comments on the sword verses) from the days of the caliph Uthman or before. Overall it is a quick, adequately informative read, but I would not make it your last stop in searching for the best text on a quick introduction to the Koran."
2,The Beauty of Gesture,"As an tai chi chuan player of more than 14 years and an amateur pianist for a much longer period, I thought this book might have been written especially for me. Not so, unfortunately. It is beautifully written in a rather voulu, creative writing school kind of way. But it has little to say about taichi--no Chinese sources are mentioned, none of the tai chi classics are mentioned. Indeed, she touches very lightly on tai chi and most of what she does say seems to come from a Japanese source (David speaks of katas, her dojo). No mention of chi (qi), the style of tai chi she does, names of the forms etc; and the dantian appears as the tanden. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who knows anything about tai chi. Nevertheless, there is some pleasure to be had here, some insights into literature and gesture. It just doesn't really deliver on the promise of its subtitle."
5,I LOVE YONOMICON!!,"The Yonomicon is a great book, its like a math book full of equations to mix and make tricks. It leaves nothing unexplained, it just takes a littl while to learn to understand how McBride is explaining the tricks. It different, in a better way."
3,It could be better,"One great flaw of this book: haste.It seems that the auctor had some deadline issue or delivery date, because at the half of the book to the end there is a ""rush"" feeling. Many events could have been better explored, and the timeline could have advanced to the moment Vinas wrote the oath and measure.Beside this great little flaw the book is entertaining, but don't expect much of it. Read and put it on the bookshelves."
4,A Big Surprise,I got this book because I was interested in getting the Lost Legends Vol.2 I was a little surprised to find this book to be so good. Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down. The writing is very well done and the story line is great.
2,Big Disappointment,"I'm a huge Cannibal Ox fan, and I definitely felt that Vast was one of the strongest, only rivaled by Murs in my opinion, emcees at Defjux. I've seen him live twice and he's a tight performer. But this album is really bad, especially if you had high expectations from a rapper who rightfully instills such in his fans. I don't know what went wrong with the making of this solo album. Vast doesn't seem to be talking about anything except battling for 9/10 of the album. Vast's flow is still tight but his delivery seems lacking any feeling but bitterness that he's doing a solo effort instead of another Canox album. Weak tracks that seem thrown together in no particular order over mediocre production with little to no content earns this a 2 star deal. If you're a true Canox fan then I would still get this album, there are a few tracks and lines in it that are worth knowing if you want to see all he can offer."
5,This book is my way to begin Spring!,"Around February, I start to get the itch for flowers...and that usually means that it is time for me to read, for the first time in the new year, SUNFLOWER HOUSES. This book never fails to pacify me while I look at seed catalogs and plot out our small suburban yard for the next spring, summer and fall...with flowers and bushes and vegetables. I am always filled with whimsie and peace by the ideas and suggestions that this ""not so typical"" gardening book provides...and it helps me convey my love for the garden and all it brings to my 3 small children. ---And I can hardly wait until they are old enough to read it with me each February...March...April and May..."
5,The Best!,There's no doubt about the best Christmas albums..they bring back great memories and that's what Bing does with this ageless album. Buy it and enjoy!
4,Just what I needed.,I should have bought all I could find. Good stuff. Now they quit making it. Figures. Guess the husband is back in the guest room.
4,What a saver,"I bought this item for my father for Christmas 2008. We used it the same day to peel about 30 potatoes for dinner. This product reduced the time and effort of peeling the potatoes of many different shapes and sizes to around 30 minutes. After we were finished we were very quickly able to clean it and get rid of the peels.I would recommend this product to anyone. I'm not sure on the life of the product, but I will hope to update before Christmas 2009."
3,Not as good........,I originally owned the electric version of the Rotato and loved it. I found the manual version to be difficult and not nearly as good. Used it twice and it now is a fixture in a corner of the cabinet.
3,nice perfume,"This is a nice smelling perfume that is a great gift. The bottle is tiny, but it is perfect for the purse or to give as a gift."
2,Good for a basic home theather but don't expect much,I bought this hoping to integrate my TV and Xbox360 (which has a built in DVD) and it was probably a little bit of a waste of money. I was turned on by the Ipod integration but the Xbox360 actually has the same ability. The system is now my receiver for my Xbox360 and doesn't go through my TV which is alright but would be great if it was for TV and Xbox. I live in a decent size apartment and the wattage is good but not great. I've maxed out the volume and it's not ear shattering. The sound it good but I'm not really an audiophile so I can't tell you about high's and low's. If I were to do it again I would either buy a kickass speaker/receiver combo or upgrade to the s-301 for the better components. It'll come in handy in the future when I have multiple TV's some day.
1,Thomas A Potter Denon purchase,"I have tried to get the radio (AM and FM) to recieve stations but cannot get the radio to work. I have tried verious antennas but none will work.My old set works but the new Denon will not bring in any stations.Therefore I would like to return the Denon set. Please advise the proceduer.Thanking youThomas A Potter tagsp3@verizon.net 2301 Mariner's Mark Way #201 VirginiaVirginia Beach, VA 23451Thanking you"
2,"Pleasing sound, but lousy DVD player!","I bought the Denon S-101 2.1 home theater system to get rid of all the wires my wife didn't like! I thought the system sounded better than the Bose 3-2-1 system and I got a good deal from Best Buy when I bought my 50"" panasonic plasama tv.The S-101 had decent sound, not great, but good. The sub woofer had adjustments but was not earth shaking! After using the system for 13 months the dvd player failed to recognize the dvd's and cd's I was trying to play. I called customer service and they told me to send it to a shop in VA for repairs, and of course the warranty was up and I would have to pay for the shipping and repairs. I was told it could cost as much as to $400.00 to repair. Hell, I could buy a new system for less than that!I would definitly never buy another Denon home theater system again, or any system with the dvd player integrated in with the speaker system.If the dvd player fails, your screwed!"
4,Amazing lyrics,"This is a beautiful CD. The lyrics especially are amazing - totally real. These songs are obviously very personal, but listening to them you feel like she's telling your story too. Very cool."
1,Broke just before the warranty,"This camera broke just before the 1 year warranty was up. By the time I sent it in, the warranty expired. Olympus wanted a flat rate of $141 just to look at it. They wouldn't quote me a flat rate until I mailed it in. If I had known they wanted that much to look at it, I would have just thrown it away."
5,Awesome camera,This was an upgrade for me; I had a 2 mp Olympus for 2 1/2 years and wanted to be able to do more. It will be a fun camera to use (as soon as I learn it) because it has so many creative features. The only drawback is I wish it had a hard copy of the instruction manual because the pdf manual is almost 200 pages. That's a lot of ink!
2,disappointing and repetitive,"I just love the concept of this book, but when it came down to reading it, I found that it was TOO much like reading e-mails between friends. It quickly felt repetitive and it contained information that was not always accurate or helpful (for example, I am surprised that their editor did not catch the references to nipple stimulation to bring on labor without inserting a warning that this can actually bring on dangerously strong contractions and should only be done with the consent of your doctor).I really wanted to like this book, it was going to be my fun and fluffy mommy book, but it just didn't turn out that way."
1,A good book...for white women only,"I read the first 20 or so pages of this book. Sure it was ok, these women aren't that funny. They kind of bore me after a while. The one thing I should mention about this book is that if you are not a white woman, you will not appreciate the way these women call brown nipples 'disgusting'. They have one conversation about how their bodies will change, and how they wish things that are pink will stay pink. Then that's where the 'ewww- brown nipples are disgusting!"" comes in. I hope I will stop at least 1,000 women from buying this book. I can't believe their editor let them put that in the book, that is kind of racist. I am so glad I read that part before it was too late to return it! I hope you found this useful."
3,I like parts of this workout.,"This is an OK workout. I use parts of it as an add on to the workouts I really love. As a whole it's kind of slow, kind of boring, and the background is just weird. The moves do seem effective. The Quick Fix Stability Ball is a much, much better workout."
2,Not for Beginners,"This stability ball workout is definitely a more advanced routine and is not for beginners. This was the first stability ball DVD that I purchased and became quickly frustrated with the routine due to the level. If you are a beginner, I would recommend Leslie Sansone's You can do Stability Ball training. If you are a beginner or more advanced, I would recommend Denise Austin's Shrink the Female Fat Zone or the QuickFix Stability Ball training. My all time favorite DVD for the stability ball is Denise Austin. This is by far my least favorite."
1,Marketing issues...........,"At times an interesting read, but the lost teachings seem to be just that....lost. And you won't find them here, unless they are hidden. I suppose they are not, in fact. Just lost. On the other hand, the publishers have a great marketing gig. The Lost Teachings of Jesus....by the Prophets!! But minor ones."
2,Misleading Title--Not a Best of Collection,"This definitely is not a collection of Carl Perkins' best songs. Rather, the majority of the tracks on this CD are fairly mediocre Gospel songs. As you might expect, there are a number of ""Best of"" and ""Greatest Hits"" collections for this rock and roll pioneer. Only three of the tracks from this collection, Blue Suede Shoes, All Mamas Children, and Dixie Fried are on any of them--with the exception of a Platinum Collection MP3 offering, Best of Carl Perkins, which must be just as bad as this CD is. Fortunately for me, I bought this CD used, so it didn't cost me much. Don't make the same mistake-stay away from this CD."
3,"OK, but get ""Clare to Here"" first.","This looks like a ""greatest hits"" collection by this most underrated of the great British singer-songwriters, but buyer beware. This is a set of Ralph's early songs and some blues covers, mostly recorded with just voice and guitar, dating from 1968-1969. Documentation is nonexistent except for notation of the authorship of the songs. The recording quality is not the best. Those exploring the extraordinary career and gifts of Ralph McTell would be much better off spending the extra money for the collection entitled ""From Clare to Here,"" which contains a much broader range of Ralph's songs, better recorded and performed. That album is a five-star masterpiece. This one should primarily be of interest to Ralph's ardent fans, as it contains some rare early songs and covers perhaps not available elsewhere on CD. The performances are perfectly fine, but don't get this one until you have bought and memorized ""From Clare to Here."""
2,Don't bother,"I found the information to be a ""hit and miss"" affair.In addition, the tone of the book came across as rather belittling. It felt as if the authors truly believed it was being written for ""Dummies."" I usually donate books I've decided not to keep, but this one went straight into the trash. I just couldn't find it in me to hand a bomb to another human being.As a final note, dear reader; if you are smart enough to read this review, you are far too smart for ""Getting Your Book Published for Dummies."""
2,NOT up to par with Connie Willis' best!,"If you've read ""To Say Nothing of the Dog"" and ""The Doomsday Book,"" and you're looking for more Connie Willis material that's as amazing as those, DON'T waste your time with this book. It has none of her usual wit and charm, what character development it has is contrived and thin, and you know from page 1 EXACTLY where it's going plotwise.It was entertaining in the way that most mediocre sitcoms are -- no intellectual stimulation, but if you need to stare at something to kill a little time, it'll satisfy that need."
5,Very Happy With,"This is the first time I have used a glass cutter, but did not want a plastic one. I do not know how this compares to other cutters, but I simply filled it with oil, and started cutting as I saw in some youtube videos. I cut straight edges, I cut curves, and I did not cut my fingers. So thumbs up! Remember to smooth sharp edges and vaccuum up small glass shavings/dust."
4,Good but----,The book held my interest and the plot and setting were unusual. But Samantha got extremely stupid in the last couple of chapters & made decisions that were completely illogical and irresponsible.
1,Yuck,I love mystery books but this was is the worst one I havetried to read. There are too many books out there to readso I am trashing this one and going on to something else.Gave it a good try but can't make it past chapter 7.
3,What about GISP???,"The Ice Chronicles certainly shows that Mayewski is a glaciologist extraordinaire. However, it needs to be pointed out that GISP2 did indeed come after GISP (which the authors fail to mention by its name - the Greenland Ice Sheet Program). GISP is not noted in the index nor is the publication Greenland Ice Cores: Geophysics, Geochemistry, and the Environment. C.C. Langway, Jr., H.Oeschger, and W. Dansgaard, Editors, Geophysical Monograph 33, American Geophysical Union, 1985. --- the early results of GISP.The photo comparison of the Himalayan glacier on page 11 is not as striking as the authors intended. Had it been taken from the same perspective, the reader might have been able to discern the dramatic change. It seems that it was included to indicate Mayewski's wide ranging visits to the world's glaciers.For such a detailed discussion of ice research and polar matters it is unfortunate that the authors spell the famous polar explorer Finn Ronne as Finn Ronnie"
4,Cute Toy,"My son is a little young to be playing with this toy, but at almost 5 months he is very interested in it. When he gets a little bit older, I think the toy will be great for him. It takes some coordination to get the animals hooked onto the bottom of the helicopter, and I like that there are several of them to choose from. I also like the durability of the toy. It does not look like it would break easily. Right now my son likes the motion of the propeller, and he will watch me play with it for quite awhile before he loses interest. Very cute."
1,Loved the Q & A in the back,"This was the first time I've read Monica McInerney. The explaination and title caught me. I love books about family, Ireland and travel. I thought the book was slow at first but it delveloped into a very interesting story. I particulary loved the Questions and Answer's in the back of the book. I got a real in-depth look at the author and she is someone I would want for a friend."
4,Cute Set!,"I just received this set today. I was a little worried about the set when I first opened the package. The comforter had a bit of an odd smell and the sheets were very stiff - this is the reason I only gave it 4 stars. After the initial washing, the set was fantastic and looks very cute on my daughters bed."
4,"I just bought this book 4Th edition, cd doesn't work","same problem as lady below me, i bought it mainly for the cd description, so i am a little upset"
5,AWESOME!!!!,"This is a great game. It has a great story line, great action and some naked chicks... never a bad thing. I will most definetly be buying God of War II."
4,"Very good game, but short","It's one of the best PS2 games, have a unique style of playing and an innovative ideas, with alot of puzzles which makes it very intersting. But on the other side, it's short, I hope it was a little bit longer. In general it worth buying."
1,BEWARE god of war.......!,"I received an early demo copy of this game, and loved it. Couldn`t wait to get my hands on it.Three exchanged copies later, i`m left with a fifty dollar coaster. It seems the game won`t load in first gen ps2`s, so unless your willng to buy a new system just to play this game, STAY AWAY until sony either de-bugs the disk or is willing to refund your money(like that is going to happen)."
5,amazing,this game for the ps2 is one of the best to come out in a long time. the graphics are some of the best that you will find of the ps2. the story keeps drawing you in. the controls are easy to remember. the only downside that i could find with this is that it was a little short. but you can play it more than once which is good. im playing it on god mode right now. also it is incredibly cinematic. go it now. if you can muster it.
4,Fun fighter but lousy at everything else,"While I enjoyed the game tremendously, it works best when it sticks to what it does well - combat.The puzzles are easy, but the platforming is ridiculously difficult at points when the game has you walking across balancing beams and such, and the controls are lacking. The game gets tedious and the automatic difficulty drop question keeps coming up when the reason for repeatedly dying is a puzzle and not an enemy, gets exceedingly annoying. The game has some sloppy programming.But when it sticks to combat, and huge, rolling boss fights, the game is incredibly fun. Gorgeous graphics and fluid combat control. Powerups are also varied enough to keep it from being too linear.The story itself is epic but just brutal and feels like it's brutal for the sake of brutality. But if you don't already have violent fantasies, you'll probably be fine. Just don't let your prepubescent kid get his hands on this."
2,sucks,"I dont see what the hypes about , you go around killing people with a stupid flam thing and the games about 2 hours to beat , really let me down"
1,good until they ran out of ideas!!!,"It's ok until you get to the part where you have to walk through thin planks while avoiding traps. Trust me, that part is so frustrating that it made me hate this game so much!!! Stupid game designers who come up with stupid ideas like this should be fired!!! Anyway, I got past that but then came the final battle. I'd been playing in normal mode but then I has to switch to easy mode just to beat the final boss! Well that was fine, or so I thought. To unlock the bonuses, you have to beat God mode!!! well, by god mode they literally meant you have to be a god to beat it. yes, god because only a god can beat that ridiculously impossible difficulty level! In other words, you can forget about the ""unlockables"" because you won't be able to unlock them. zero replay value!!!"
1,Overrated,The only fun part in this game is fighting the minotaur. The rest is so repetitive and boring after awhile and I feel like I was lied to. Dave Jaffe promised you wouldn't get stuck in combos and what happens a ton that makes this game very frustrating is sticking in combos.
3,my husband loved it,"I bought it as a just because gift for my husband. He loved it and I enjoyed watching him play. The game is not for the faint of heart though there were some parts that were a bit difficult to watch and difficult to play as well not technically but morally. There is sexual and very violent content which you HAVE to participate in, in order to advance in the game. I would think there are quite a few Christians who will NOT enjoy this game. And it is most DEFINITELY, NOT!!! for children under 17 imho."
4,Excellent guide for discovering Vermont,"This is an excellent addition to the Falcon Guide hiking series, and the author adds a touch of humor and class to each route description. The driving directions to each trailhead are detailed and accurate. the route descriptions are similarly packed with information that any hiker can use. If there was a chance of seeing wildlife, Pletcher duly notes it and informs you when the best times are for seeing bears or moose. If you're backpacking, he tells you where to find water and where reliable springs are located.I was a little disappointed that he didn't concentrate more on the 260 mile Long Trail which traverses the length of Vermont. I was looking for information of their shelters and side routes into towns along the way. But for day hikers, this is a good, reliable and handy guide. Recommended."
1,"Just a heads-up, everthing has side effects","Breathe Right Nasal Strips Really help my night time breathing and sleep. But the use up to 12 hrs/day disclaimer may have some significance.I think these strips stretch the tissue of my nose just a bit. Cosmetically this isn't much of a big deal to me, but the out-of-the-ordinary soreness and nose bleeds my daughter and I both experienced during a recent bout of the flue coupled with 24/day use of these strips on a tender inflamed noses suggests that they can be over used.Gave them one star only because many people, me included read the negative reviews first. They're really a 4.5 star product."
2,Buffalo Woman Comes Singing,"To be quite honest about this book, I did not finish reading it, even though it was well written. It's a case of mistaken identity: about halfway through it was evident that Brooke Medicine Eagle is preaching New Age religion and is not holding to traditional practices and beliefs, as I hoped when I bought this book. At the point where she was explaining how she believes that Christianity and Traditional beliefs are consitent with each other, I quit reading and merely skimmed, finding that this book is a conglomeration of different beliefs, including 12-step programs. Perhaps this is what a reader may be looking for; this reader was not. Those looking for Traditional reading might wish to read Sacred Fireplace, by Pete S. Catches, Sr., or Crow Dog, by Leonard Crow Dog and Richard Erdoes, both of which are filled with traditional spiritual insight and practice."
1,These reviews are not true-- in my opinion,"I am sick and tired of all this marketing tricks. It is very clear that most of the reviews written about this book are actually written by people marktng this book under different account names. It is very clear that these reviews are sales pitches for the book.I have read enough real reviews of products, and get my own products reviewed by many customers. These reviews are fake- in my opinion. And this is a clear sign that this book, it's publishers, and author, are not honest people you should trust.If you have any problems with what I wrote here, feel free to contact me."
2,COMMON SENSE!,The book is okay. Basically just plain old common sense. The introduction and preface is all you really need to read to comprehend the value of the book.
2,Needs work,"The CobraHead doesn't work very well until you bend the shaft so that the cobra blade is in line with the handle. Bending requires some muscle and tools. As supplied, the weeder tends to turn in your hand."
2,Weeding tool????,I watched the video on the presentation page a thought this looked like a good tool to tackle Bermuda grass that invaded some of my flower beds. I was wrong. I'm not sure how this tool can be pragmatically used to remove unwanted growth. Perhaps it is only good to remove the example plant shown in the video. I would NOT purchase again.
3,A disappointment,"The conceit here is that the only copy of Dunn's latest book, a biography of Jonathan Blashette, ""the child circus sideshow performer who later made his fotune in male deodorants"", has been lost, and the publisher is making it up to him by publishing the footnotes.It's an amusing idea but it doesn't quite come off. The problem is that the footnotes aren't. I mean that they are not the type of footnotes that one ordinarily finds in a book. They are either far too long, or contain material that would ordinarily be in the main text, or digress so far off the subject that they would never be included. On top of which, the character is a bit too odd.What made Dunn's Ella Minnow Pea a delight was that he managed to make its odd premise seem perfectly natural. But here, the story, like Procrustes' victims, seems to have been stretched and chopped to fit the concept."
3,"Mom likes, but kids lost interest","I think this plane is adorable and fun, with the propellers that spin when you rev it, and the pilot and tiger. My 3 year old boys each have one, but it has never been a favorite toy. I think it may be that the revving mechanism is different than many toys, which you pull back and let go, whereas with this one, you rev it forward. The kids have trouble getting it to go very far. When they do play with it, they seem to really enjoy it."
2,don't weigh what they say,I found that these dumbells didn't weigh the listed amount -- both of them weighed over 10.5 pounds (not 10). And they didn't weight the same they were over a quarter of a pound different from one another in weight.
4,Great for arm exercises,"Wasn't too happy with the packing of these dumbbells, I purchased 2, but they serve the purpose they were purchased for very well."
4,Interesting,"Of course Miles Copeland had to do with this DVD. There is quite a bit of info packed on it, yet it falls short in some areas, leaving me wanting to know more. There is footage in each country that these people came from. And it was nice getting a glimpse of how they live/survive. I can't imagine living in that kind of turmoil. I wish they would have shown all of the show. It was nice seeing dancers I recognized in the audience."
1,A good book if you want to gain weight.,"If you like""Association Diets,"" especially one from one of the most politically agressive and media savvy organizations, this one is for you. One look shows the typical high starch, high glycemic diet that almost killed me. If you are truly interested in eating healthy, this type of one-size-fits all diet guide is just about useless."
3,Not As Good As Previous Efforts,"My whole family enjoyed Bloor's previous novels (Tangerine and Crusader) and have become used to his disregard for standard plot ""rules."" Even though we fully expected the unexpected, we were still surprised by the outcome. Unfortunately, we were also disappointed by the ""evil"" adult characters who were often less than believable, performing impossible actions designed only to make them more dislikeable. We enjoyed the strong character of Kate and the relationship with her uncle was well-developed. Bloor does an admirable job of poking fun at the national trend toward testing as an end instead of a means. I believe that Bloor listened to reviewers and readers who liked the ""weirdness"" of his previous two novels and tried to make this one even weirder. Too far!"
4,ON POINT$$$$$,"This should be a required read for youth. I really feel that if they read this book , it would stir so many from choosing the thug lifestyle. One would get some idea of what it involves and hopefully not chose it,he kept it real. Hmm ""ya boy now might not be ya boy later down de road"" ,if you do. I look forward to reading more from Thomas.The only problem I had was with his ""I's and ""My's"" for which person he was referring to , which slowed it a bit (I was able to figure them out). Had to go forward and then back . He probably could have used the character name at the top left hand corner. Because many of the chapters started with the word ""I"" and it was different people."
4,Thug Life,I must say it was very interested and keep me on the edge I had to finish it. I was most intrigued by Dayvon he was a gangster character however being from New York I never thought other cities got down like that B-more is a gangster ass city. I can't wait for the sequel. The end was very predictable however the drama and the suspense in the book made it all worth wild. I lok forward to reading nother one of Thomas Long's creationson paper
3,Why only gray??,"The lenses themselves are not bad, especially for the very low price, but why make them gray instead of black, as the almost totality of lenses and serious cameras?I'd have rated them with 4 stars if they had been black."
5,busy mother of 3,"Great DVD, highly recommend it. If you can't get away to a gym to workout, this is a great alternative, inexpensive, low tech, very doable for a middleage woman trying to get back in shape. I can do this on the basement floor while the kids play! The exercises offer two levels so if it's too hard you can do the easier version. Very pleasant leader, very encouraging, not a ""fluff"" or scantily clad kind of female but very atheletic and also middle age. I'm already noticing good results in 1 weeks use so give it a try!!!"
2,Very basic,"Not a bad video, but extremely easy. I am not in great shape and it doesn't really challenge me. But if you are really just starting to work out, it might be a good video to try."
5,quick fix stability ball,I get a great workout w/ the stability ball quick fix routine......I like that there are 3 10 minute workouts that I can do at any time..separately or together...I have other quick fix workouts and I like them as well..
2,flimsy plastic,"This measuring cup is kinda flimsy plastic, and the handle isn't very comfortable. Here's a much better oneMeasuring Cup, 2 Cupand for a couple dollars more an even better one2.5 Cups Cool Grip Measuring Cup"
5,Ultra Pro pages = top shelf,"Ultra Pro pages really are the best. Super clarity, and more importantly, wonderfully durable. You will not accidentally rip these pages, and they hold up over time. I found my old binder of sports cards from 20 years ago, which had a mix of Ultra Pro and no-name brand pocket pages in it. The Ultra Pro pages were just like new, but I accidentally ripped one of the no-name brand pages while flipping through the binder before I realized that I would have to take extra care with them. 20 years and just like brand new is a good enough testament for me!"
3,Good printer but has two major cons,I own three of these machines for my business. It does everything you need. However there are two cons to the machine. Two of the three machines I have had problems with the heated roller. Both have a dark burned in line on it causing black lines to print down every page. I have tried to get parts but they are as much as the machine itself. The other con is that the drum for the machine averages around $90 which is half the cost of the machine. But if you are looking for something to work consistently for a year and basically throw it away it does a good job. Camparable printers with the same specs costs dramatically more money.
4,Brother Printer does a good basic job,"This copier has worked well for me.Advantages:1. Space saving design2. Fast Printing3. good scanner4. Easy to use5. Really like the automatic feeder!6. Good valueDisadvantages1. Some paper curling2. Not compatible with some programs (Office Mate Optometry program)Overall, VERY pleased."
3,Average Printer Frustrates,"Overall this printer performs fine. However when feeding labels and form papers, the feed often pulls off-center leading to uncentered printed results. The printer makes a lot of noise while idling down after printing.Also did not realize how much I miss having a color printer. I honestly wish I had returned the product within the timeframe allowed."
4,From Loyal HP user to BROTHER MACHINES.,"This is one of the best utilitaian machines for the money. My business runs about 250 sheets a day and this thing spits them out steady-without a hitch and without the worry of print cartriges. A well spent $150.00 bucks for my money. Get one and relax. Technology runs so fast, its gonn be outdated allready anyway-why spend a yton.This does it all -EXCEPT COLOR...."
1,Total scam,"This printer works great until you get about halfway through the toner cartridge and it keeps giving you a toner low warning and refuses to print. You have to then take the cartridge out, shake it and put it back in. It will do this about every other page. It is a complete scam to make you buy more toner when you don't in fact need it. Unbelievably unethical. Running a printer with low toner does nothing to damage the printer itself, so stopping the printer from printing when the toner is ""low"" is only to make you buy more of their ink.If you have the opportunity to buy another printer with similar qualities, go with something else. While there may be ""fixes"" to this toner low issue, it's extremely frustrating when you need to print something and it keeps forcing you to stop because the the toner is low.Read other reviews, they'll reference this issue as well. Extremely frustrating."
2,NOT for envelope printing,"Overall this all-in-one does a decent job, but one of the items I NEED a printer to do is print envelopes, and sadly this printer just can't do a decent job on envelopes. Most of the envelopes I've tried to print come out crooked, and many have ghost images (duplicate images slightly offset from the main image). This happened to 4 out of 5 envelopes I've tried to print, and nothing I do seems to fix the problem.If you don't need to print envelopes, this printer seems adequate. If envelope printing is important, just stay away from this printer."
4,Fast and reliable,"This is my first laser printer, so I don't know how it compares to others, but it's dramatically faster than my old HP inkjets. A 10-page pdf magazine article prints in seconds. I've run a few hundred pages though the printer so far without a single problem. The single sheet feeder is a bit tricky to feed paper into. It's also used for envelopes, which for some reason always come out with a crunched corner -- a minor annoyance for me, but probably not acceptable for some uses. The machine is also pretty noisy when it fires up, but it goes back to silent sleep mode soon enough when not in use. My only other complaint is that the ""starter"" cartridge that comes with the printer seemed to be significantly less than 50% full as advertised. Soon after seeing the low-ink warning, it stopped printing altogether until I installed a new cartridge (much cheaper at Amazon than, say, Staples)."
2,save your money,"The amount of light is barely sufficient at best. The range of detection is less than a 90 degree angle. The sensitivity is off - it goes on when it shouldn't and stays off when it should go on. It has now died after a year's usage. Set up was pretty easy, and charge time is as expected according to the directions."
4,"Excellent, diverse work by a real talent","This album by Damien Jurado reminds me of the work of Jose Gonzalez, M. Ward and Josh Ritter, or what you might call ""new folk."" It's an excellent collection of music, and Damien Jurado demonstrates his ability as a songwriter to use the spaces between lyrics as effectively as a turn of phrase.The album does a great job of making diverse songs (the upbeat ""Matinee"" is a world apart from ""Intoxicated Hands"" and the haunting ""Amateur Night"") seem to fit together the spaces of forgotten Americana like a Cormac McCarthy novel.Unfortunately, this album doesn't break new ground musically or lyrically. In fact, the new album by Iron & Wine and Calexico (""In the Reins"") sounds very similar. For examples of the finest in the genre, check out Lucinda Williams' ""Car Wheels on a Gravel Road"", or the work of the late, great Johnny Cash."
5,"Wonderful book, but no digital edition",What do I have to do to get a Bundle of Grundle on my Kindle?
2,Vic Firth salt shaker,I was disappointed with this item. I love the pepper grinder but the shaker doesn't seem to work well. It is difficult to get the salt out. I use regular salt not kosher but still have a problem with it.
4,Worth Watching Even for One Scene Alone,"I have a tape of this film that I haven't seen in about 8 years. Therefore, plot details have escaped me. But, in short, it's a rather sad tale of a small, small-town family whose patriarch, played by Anthony Quinn, has a mid-life crisis and philanders about while his sad, lonely wife, played with typical sensitivity and pity by Shirley Booth, sits at home, overlooking his transgressions. I remember enjoying the whole film, including Shirley MacLaine's turn as their daughter. However, one scene which stands out takes place between Eileen Eckhart and Shirley Booth. It's in the middle of the afternoon, and Eckhart teaches Booth how to drink in, I believe, Booth's kitchen. It is quietly HYSTERICAL, and proves how wonderful Eckhart was as an actress. This scene could have gone on another five minutes, it was just so entertaining."
5,Great book,"This book is a really great behind-the-scenes type book about the real Von Trapp family. Fans of the movie may not like it as much, because there isn't very much stuff written about the making of the SOM. However, it really gives you a very clear picture of the way the story reall was without detracting from the magic of the movie."
5,Good product.,The product does what it is supposed to do. It definitely comes in handy. No problems with the purchase .
3,"""Stainless steel"" is not so stainless","This product is very functional - it does hold all sizes of lids and spoons. What it doesn't do is clean well. After my VERY FIRST USE, which was to lay a spoon on the spoon rest which had been used to stir boiling pasta (note: just water and pasta, nothing that would stain anything), a water mark appeared on the spoon rest. Washed it with soap, water, and sponge - wouldn't come off. Rubbed with a dry paper towel. Still there. Finally, scrubbed with the rough side of the sponge meant for pots and pans. The spot finally came off (well, mostly; there is still a faint mark) but now the spoon rest has scratches on it. Even though I will still use it I'm very disappointed because it looks old and scratched after one use."
1,Unbelievable,"I ordered two of these for my double-volume Oxford English Dictionary. Because you can't choose your own colors or patterns, I just hoped for something respectable.The first cover had a ""Charles in Charge"" theme, featuring Scott Baio's smiling face. The other cover had '90s fad phrases, the likes of which included ""Don't go there"" and ""Talk to the hand.""If I had a pistol, I would point it at the roof of my mouth, so that my brains would splatter liberally across the room through the back of my head."
2,What's the point??,"I have to agree with the other reviewers that many great selections were left off, and some of the newer ones aren't as good. I also have to add, what's the point? These songs collected on this cd are about all sorts of subjects in a completely random order. I was searching for an audio cd of specific educational categories, which apparently they did have some time ago (but are now only available used, at premium scalper prices!!). A collection like this would be novel to listen to once or twice for nostalgia's sake, but most who would want them for their children (teachers, homeschoolers, parents, grandparents...) are going to want one cd of multiplication rock, one cd of america rock, one cd of grammar rock, etc.--not just a few random selections that really helps no one."
5,Money Well spent,"As I have said before many times. These catch childrens attention and keep it light and fun. If they only take a few things from these DVD's, it is worth it. We seem to complicate so many things for them. Keep it simple."
5,Great C.D!,"This is a great CD to learn from. I recomend it for children that are learning things like adjetives,verbs,conjuntion words, and so forth! They will learn so much from just one CD!"
4,Best of Schoolhouse Rock,"Teachers, I bought this for use with my Social Studies classes. I have the songs playing in the background as my students are entering the room or doing independent work. These familiar old Schoolhouse Rock songs actually do have real information in the lyrics! It's a great way to utilize a more non-traditional modality for introduction and reinforcement of material."
4,A great way to share my childhood with my kids!,"""The Best of"" CD was great fun for me to play for my kids the first time. It was a chance to share a part of my childhood with them. The songs are as adictive now as they were then (and as ""the Mom"", I don't find myself growing quickly tired of the repetitive playing of the CD). I am thrilled that my five-year-old can recite the Preamble to the Constitution. It is a fabulous CD (although I miss Lolly, Lolly, Lolly, Get your Adverbs Here) - my all-time favorites were not ALL included in ""The Best of"", but it does contain most of them. I hope my kids play it for my grandchildren someday!"
5,Schoolhouse Rock is the Best!,"My five-year-old & 21-month-old kids LOVE Schoolhouse Rock. We listen to it in the car every day. There's a few songs on there that I don't remember (and funny how those aren't my kids favs) but most of them I do and it's so fun to hear them & sing-a-long to them with my kids. I totally recommend this CD to everyone - parents who remember watching these as a kid, grandparents who enjoy singing along to great songs with their grandkids and even kids who want to learn a little about math, science and everything else!"
3,not for strong chewers,"My tiny puppy was able to rip of chunks of the fish. I didn't think he was a ""power chewer"" but I guess he is. No worries though, Nylabone stands behind their products and all I had to do was email them a picture of the chunked up fish and they sent me two brand new toys no charge!"
3,Tutorial more than reference,"This book is fine if you are looking to start at page 1 and buy into their ongoing eg program. My gripe is thatthe eg program is Swing based. I hate Swing eg's in general. They generally just make the specific point that is being demonstrated more difficult to identify. So, please, all you authors out there, for the love of god don't use Swing eg's unless your writing a book on Swing.It's the sort of book that makes you work to understand things that you already know."
5,Review of Ridpath & Tirion's Guide to Stars and Planets,"For beginners to advanced amateurs, there is no other guide more comprehensive and better formatted than Ridpath & Tirion's Guide to Stars and Planets. For starters you can get a broad picture of the sky for any month at any location, thus avoiding the need for a planisphere. Once you've found your way from constellation to constellation, you're ready to harvest the best this book offers: There is a map of each constellation, showing the most interesting and accessible objects for viewing with naked eyes, binoculars or small telescopes. Accompanying each map are descriptions of these objects. I've tried many guides and plenty of astronomical software, but this is the guide that I always take with me and it's the first port of call for information during an observing session - there's none better. Collins, how about another print run of the superb book?"
2,rated too high,The inner cover has an inscription. I think it was rated too high for the quality of the book.
4,Not enough celebration,"I gave this a four star because I wish more of the fan's celebration would have been shown. I would have gladly paid more if the DVD would have been longer after the Minnesota win and the Super Bowl win to show more of the Who DAT Nation celebration. An extra DVD showing the presentation of the trophy would have been worth the extra money, at least to every Who DAT out there!"
3,About As Good As The Original,Angelia and her friends have a halloween party at an abandioned spooky house only for it to possess them one by one into demons and the only way to stop it is to have one of the survivors sacrifice themselves to rid the curse. A fun remake with decent makeup effects & storyline.
1,Don't expect much,"Keep your expectations low. Really really low. Do that, and you may be entertained at least.This movie has a ton of standard cliche halloween/horror movie fare such as : old mansion with a dark past/bunch of people died tragically/mysteriously, bleeding walls, scantly clad women kissing each other, Type o Negative and other industrial/punk rock music, vicious circle of events, tragic weakness in the monsters, halloween part gone horribly wrong, one person walks out, etc. Not too much great to mention. Very predictable. Mostly lame.I would recommend renting this rather than buying it. That way, you don't waste your money in addition to the time. Like I said... Don't expect much."
3,Not bad but not what I was hoping for.,I was looking forward to this film as I love the original. It was ok. I am just getting really tired of all these movies revolving around drugs and booze. It seems almost every new horror remake does this even if the original did not!! And it isn't just a little it is always over the top.Acting was fine and the effects were good. What's with Edward Furlong?? It looks like he has a hump on his back. Check this one out if you want but stick with the original.
1,night of the demons remake,this movie sucks sucks sucks just like all remakes.i really did not this movie.buy the frist one it the best one.
1,Just stupid...,"This movie was missing all the elements that made the original fun. The creepy atmosphere and backstory were nowhere to be found. Instead, there's more sexual references and horrible special effects. Everything is over-the-top and outlandish. This almost seemed more like a spoof film than an actual horror movie."
5,A Good Collection of Horror,"The editor does an excellent job in collecting a wide variety of storys through-out the horror genre. Not only is each story presented, a small discussion on the contribution to field of horror writing is discussed.As a fan of true horor literature - I recommend this book. Nowadays it is difficult to find a good horror book or stories that don't involve mutilations, death and other unique ways to cause the reader to react on a few brief descriptions - as opposed to the entire content of the story."
4,Bulova 96C35,Just wanted to say that I do like this watch very much. Nevertheless I have to say that the Black Leather Strap has a poor quality for the watch itself.Overall the watch is great - good size and great brand.thanks
1,Interesting but wait for a corrected edition.,"The subject is really interesting. The theory part of the networks (frame,...). But you find in this books many errors and when you read it, you don't know what's true and what's wrong."
2,Disappointing,"This book does not live up to its billing. It does provide 2000 questions and lots of information, but some of the simple questions are answered incorrectly, which of course makes me wonder how many questions as a whole are answered incorrectly.There are enough ""bugs"" in this book to warrant an immediate ""patch upgrade"" or a web site dedicated to correcting the errors.I would guess that the errors were largely due to a lack of effective proofreading.All in all, it is a good reference book, but don't count on passing the CCIE written exam simply because you have the book."
3,"Wow - lots of errors, I'll buy the 3rd ed. for sure!","I think this book was rushed into production because of the shear number of aspiring CCIEs. I'm glad I understand enough to recognize the errors but that worries me for the content I don't catch as incorrect. My company will continue to purchase the re-releases for me, but I won't buy my own until the 3rd or 4th editions come out."
1,Do NOT assume these answers are correct!,"I have had very little time with this book. I let it fall open and it landed on pages 468 & 469.Questions 174,178,180 and 188 have some serious problems.I am sure that this book has some real fine information, but it will not help you to prepare for the witten exam. There are no true false questions on the exam. There are no yes no questions on the exam.What is on the exam is several difficult questions concerning scenarios that are presented.Are there any scenario questions in the book?As I said previously I am sure there is a lot of information in this book that will help the novice.But for well seasoned networkers who are preparing for the CCIE it comes well short!"
3,A book published before proof-reading.,"Nice coverage, however full of mistakes. Do not expect to be equipped with the required knowledge to solve the following questions. Do not waste your time using answer keys."
3,A Necessary Evil in CCIE Written Prep,"I just passed the CCIE Written, and used this book as my primary resource. However, I found myself questioning and cross-checking a lot of material in this book with other reference material from Cisco, IBM, Novell, RFCs, etc. It provides better coverage of the topics than any other single source, but you have to read with an ""open mind"" and not be afraid to question what you read. You pretty much have to go with this book until other CCIE written study guides come out.No coverage of the IOS or the lab at all - this is for the written test only."
2,Use only after exhaustively studying other reference books.,"This book is not recommended as a 1 stop study guide for CCIE certification. The largest drawback is the number of errors in both the text and the questions. The text does not cover all of the questions, and the questions are confusing and have too many wrong answers in the key. Even after downloading the corrected answer key, I still found more wrong answers that were not listed in the author's download site. As a result I trusted no information in the book, and diligently researched answers in more authoritative documents. Beware -- if you do not study other references, you may not realize that you are reading incorrect information or answers. Build your base of knowledge elsewhere.I believe that this book has the potential to become a viable reference once the information has been corrected and updated. I hope that the author will breath life back into his project, and give this book another go."
1,Junk!,"This book is not for anyone struggling with Calculus. It is written in very small print with no bold-face type or any other highlighting to help pick out the major points. The book has only answers to the odd problems in the back and no explanations for how they were obtained. Any explanation of topics provided through out the text is too short and actually confusing in the extreme. If your teacher is very good, then none of this may matter, but if your teacher is sub-standard in their skills and you have to teach yourself from this book, you will be out of luck. (...)"
1,"if only there was a ""zero stars"" option","I am attempting to learn calculus for the first time. I did wonderfully in pre-calculus, but this horrible book (and my thickly accented disorganized professor) have forced me to withdraw from the class and try again later.The author appears to be writing for other calculus teachers who already understand the material. The writing is incredibly confusing. The examples are not very helpful. The questions at the end of the sections are too few, and do not do a good job of building up difficulty. I find that it is easier to learn math concepts if you have a large quantity of problems to work on that start simple and progressively add more difficult aspects to them.If you are a professor thinking about using this book for your class, PLEASE RECONSIDER! If you are student with the misfortune of having to use this book for your class, hopefully your professor speaks so that you can understand him/her and maybe get another calc book to actually LEARN SOMETHING FROM."
1,It really is bad.,"For the benefit of any student about to take a course in Calc 1 using this text, I would like to echo the sentiments expressed in the majority of the previous reviews. This book is sheer bollocks, for all of the reasons already set forth: a supreme lack of clearly presented examples in every section, and an unneccesarily abstract approach when addressing even the core principles of calculus. This text simply does not constitute a complete and thorough introduction to the subject - I have had to augment my understanding with numerous other sources. If you are planning to rely on this as a main source of information, BEWARE. You will be extremely frustrated, especially when you wind up having to purchase an auxilliary text after shelling out money for this clunker. It really is as ineffective as everyone's saying it is."
3,Not all intriguing,"While there's an ocassional good piece of wisdom in this book, a lot of the quotes seem to be variations on the same thing - same point, different words. Some of them don't even seem to belong on these pages - like they just needed a few more to fill in some empty space and took what they could get. But, the few that are more than just repetitive ""fluff"" are well worth it. All in all, it gets you thinking!"
2,OK,"Its a good book to draw examples of idustries in different stages of technology evolution. However it is lacking in theoretical content,"
2,Length Without Depth (keep it on top of the tank),"Gielgud is a huge, long loaded with information about the work of John Gielgud. It is the sort of book you can open to any page and find some fascinating tidbit. But that is not enough....The book is disappointing. It has some fine annectdotes but provides little insight into Gielgud's art or theater in general. Also Gielgud's personal life is treated superficially.This adds up to a book that is dull to read for longer than 5 minutes at a stretch. This is a terrific book for bathroom reading but a lousy book for really reading."
2,Expected better,Retractable mechanism works but the blade slips with heavy duty use. I ended up tightening the blade holder with pliers; now the blade doesn't slip but the retractable mechanism doesn't work.
3,Alright,These shoes are way to expensive. I love the look of them..but really they arn't that comfertable. I think that they need to lower the price!
1,Not a HandBook,"Don't get carried away by the title descriptions ""Hand book"" and ""step-by-step plan"". If anyone is buying this book with an intention of developing a BCP/DR plan, implementing and testing it they will be disappointed. This book only helps to get an overview of BC/DR planning. I couldn't find anything readily usable in the companion CD. It contains a bunch of documents with one page and one table in it. You wouldn't find anything important and useful such as sample BC/DR plan, emergency response procedure and flow diagram."
3,night of the demons 3,this movie ok its better then night of the demons 2.the frist night of the demons is the best one.
1,transformer -toy,I paid 70.00$ and had a very dissappointed son who waited patiently for a toy and no where did it say it was a mini transformer. So we were very dissappointed and upset about the toy. It was a tiny little piece of crap that broke when opened.
1,Too hot too handle,"I decided to give B&D a go since they tend to be rated rather high. 4 years ago I attempted to buy a moderately priced toaster oven and bought a B&D but when I got it home almost burned my hand on the top of it while it was toasting. I returned it for a Toastmaster which was much more insulated and not so hot. Well, my beloved Toastmaster died so I decided to give B&D another shot and lo and behold - burned my finger tip on the top of it when I tested it out. It radiates a dangerous amount of heat and any child or adult for that matter could get seriously burned. I have a 2 yr old and a 4 yr old and could never have such a dangerous appliance on my countertop. Guess who returned it for a Toastmaster?"
1,is this guy a joke?,"the still tippin video would be perfect if i didnt have to hear about how many hoes you F**Ked and how much of a player you are. and as for paul wall look at the title, Chick Magnet. is any guy gonna take this album serious? and do i care about whats in your teeth and your mouth? hes worse than nelly and 50 cent. and he looks like Limp Bizkit after his mother fed him a bunch of sleeping pills and mouthF**ked him with John Holmes D**k! LOL!"
2,Just not very funny,I consider myself to have a good sense of humor and what is funny.These jokes and observations were just OK at best.
2,Repetitive,"Not as good as many other New Yorker cartoon books. The same few gags are repeated several times -- approaching the bench, marriage proposal, ambulance-chasing..."
4,I love this book - should be included in every homebrew starter kit,"The For Dummies series is certainly a series worth investing in. I love the ease with which they convey their knowledge and break things down to a simple and understandable process that truly educates. This applies for Homebrewing as well. I have always been interested in homebrewing, but have always been daunted by the idea of how big the task is. This book helped not only inform me of all the various parts of hombrewing, but taught a wealth of information about Beer, Cider, and Mead. I highly recommend, especially if you do are just getting started in the world of homebrewing."
3,Seems like an awful lot to pay for an atlas...,"It's a great INTRODUCTORY neuroanatomy text, simple and too the point, with lots of MRI's, gross sections, and cross sections. However, sometimes simplicity tends to increase the complexity of a subject. This especially holds true for neuroanatomy. One simply must learn certain details in order to grasp the big picture. This book is a little lacking in such details. I found the schematics using clay for different brain structures to be confusing (you'll see what I mean if you get the text). Also, it doesn't have a lot of clinical case material for medical students, which would have helped me. If you want a GREAT neuroanatomy text, I recommend Hal Blumenfeld's Neuroanatomy Through Clinical Cases. Keep in mind though that this text is tailored for the medical student in mind."
4,Excellent First Reference For Biblical End Times Theology,"This book gives an excellent overview of God's eternal plan for Israel and the Church. It does not provide a whole lot of nuts and bolts eschatology, but I don't think that was the author's intent. I strongly recommend it for the reader who wants to seek and embrace God's eternal plan for his children. After reading this book, I would recommend ""End Times"" by Walvoord for a more detailed eschatological account."
4,My Opinion Only,"A huge book with lots of useful information at an excellent price (Softback). However, there is no replacement for a knowledgable friend who really knows the subject. The index for this book as with most books of this nature is not quite complete enough to answer some particular question or why your specific problem is occuring. I am very happy that I made the purchase and would do it again, a useful, complete reference."
3,good basic reference,"At 1300 plus pages this is an impressive and excellent reference book; it shall be next to every Windows XP station. Written in much better (i.e. simplier) language than help files or MS knowledge base. Unfortunately very basic, too. If you are looking for hard to find solution without contributing to Bill Gates's welfare $250, for something that is omitted from the help files, this book is not for you."
4,SHORT TERM EVALUATION,Lot of information packed in a large heavy paperback book. The only problem I have had with it is that the disk that came with the book did not play on my DVD Player but did display writting. Hope I can solve the problem in the future.
2,A Time Wasting Volume,"I was very disappointed with this book. It simply does not provide the practical help to XP that I had anticipated. The book contains a vast amount of non-essential information and by the time you discover that the article cannot provide practical help, you have wasted entirely too much time.I found both the table of contents and the index difficult to use. I alway come away with more questions than answers to some of my technical XP problems. If you are looking for timesaving solutions, tips, tricks, or other workarounds you will be wasting your time with this title."
3,Not What I Expected,"I was really excited to buy this book, but it wasn't as great as I was expecting. The pictures are deceiving to me. I can't really use this book to identify rocks in my collection."
2,Not A Good guide for average Rocks,This turns out to be a good book to learn the wide scope of rocks in North America but little help in identifing average rocks. I bought this to help me identify beach stones for a polishing project and found that 90% of the book is devoted to rare semi precious and unusual stones. Trying to look up a simple rock found on the beach was a waste of time.
