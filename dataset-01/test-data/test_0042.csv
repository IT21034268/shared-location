5,Mattie,Really enjoyed the book. Mattie is a person I would have liked to have known. Would love to read other books similar to this.
5,I enjoyed this book very much.,Tells of a woman doctor in the late 1890's to early 1900's who practiced on the prairies of western Nebraska and the challenges she faced.
4,Mattie,Good easy read. Amazing what our ancestor went thru to go West. Mattie is a remarkable young determined person. I enjoyed reading about the journey she took.
3,Mattie,Not a bad read if you don't want to concentrate too hard.Kind of a backwoods Mills and Boone meets Little House On The Prarie.
4,Mattie was inspiring.,"Mattie takes the reader back in time to what it was like to be a ""pioneer"" in the medical field. She was the only women in a very small medical school in Nebraska but she had the desire and determination to succeed. She was given a chance to better herself even though she came from an underpriviledged and, at times, embarrassing background which haunted her all of her life. It took a driven spirit and much determination to conquer all the bumps in the road to life, both personally and professionally. A good read that kept my interest all the way."
3,Not as pictured,"Stones don't look like sapphire, the setting is dull, even for antiqued. So small that the darkness is detrimental to the whole ring. I was very disappointed."
2,Watch the shoe size.,"I ordered this product in a size 8 despite that, over the course of the past 8 years or so I have actually fit better in an 8.5, regardless of the makes and types (e.g. dress shoe, boots, running shoes, etc). In fact, I have another half boot product that is an 8.5 that fits like a glove and wears like a boot. This product however, fits like a sherman tank, despite that I ordered a smaller shoe size than what I normally take. They also wear more like galoshes and not boots."
3,Book fell short of its mark,I had high expectations when I began reading this book. I was looking for a clear and concise description of animal totems and how they related to the life of the Sioux. I was disappointed as it appeared the author never did quite get across the specific meaning of the animals and their relationship to man. The background material was good as well as the information on dances and ceremonies. Dr. Brown seemed right on the edge of a wonderful definition of the animals but just was not able to get the meaning across.
4,Die Laughing,"Not for everybody, but for people who like black humor and strong satyrical contents, it's a blast..."
4,An offbeat Xmas album,"It's Christmas in LA! Aimee Mann offers her idiosyncratic, offbeat interpretations of holiday classics like ""The Christmas Song,"" ""Winter Wonderland,"" ""White Christmas,"" and ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas."" The highlight for me is her reading of ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch."" The original cuts, such as ""Christmastime"" (written by her husband, Michael Penn) and ""Calling on Mary,"" help make this an Xmas collection to keep."
3,Put yourself to sleep this Christmas,"Amy's work of late has been quite genius, so I was expecting more greatness with her xmas cd. Unfortunately, I found her singing a bit too restrained - she sounds BORED through most of the songs, which left me disappointed. I love the artwork and Aimee, as always looks gorgeous. The best tracks are ""You're A Mean One Mr. Grinch"" and ""Calling On Mary"", which is an original song and is more in the style of songwriting and performance we're used to from Amy. Overall, this is a decent enough album to have on in the background on xmas eve, when it's dark and the lights are low inside, but it might induce a few yawns if you listen to it too attentively."
1,Ancient,Pro-arguments are solidly built.However the counter arguments are weak and artficial. Gives impressio of not trying to argue both sides of the case. Language and style archaic legalese.
4,Comfortable shoes!,"These are my second pair of Earth Lazers. I have a narrow foot, size 11, and they fit just perfectly. The heel is snug, and the toebed is more of a medium fit. But, when you walk in these shoes, the weight falls towards the heel, so you don't really need a narrow toe box. I did order them in a size ten, instead of the 11, and my foot feels supported and secure. It's great for someone with a bad back too. They are ultra light and fit easily into luggage for travel. You are probably not supposed to wash these, but I did in a low setting. They came out just fine. I don't think you should put them in the dryer, however. The price offered on Amazon, in conjunction with the Amazon credit card, made this too hard to resist. So glad I got them. Highly recommended!"
5,voltage anybody,"This is a well built multimeter (rugged) , it measures temperature also , very accurate."
2,Beware of Stability Problems,"RH 8 has everything going for it but one thing - it crashes often and hard. VERY unstable, the least little error leads to a crash. The performance degrades with time and crashes come more and more frequent. I have installed three times, each ending with total system loss (the file system becomes a total mess beyond repair) and a need for a fresh install. I have been using it about six months. Worse than old Windows OS!!! I want to like RH 8, but sorry to say it is going into the trash.Intel P4 1.6G, 256 RAM, software RAID 1 Duplex 20G ATA100 Maxtor drives"
1,Windows 1.0 was much superior....,"The new graphic user interface of this version has been much hyped. If you are looking for a replacement of Windows on your desktop, you will be completely disappointed. Windows version 1.0 was much superior to the Red Hat interface. Windows has evolved over the last 15 years and Red Hat is far far away from making Linux usable.However, if you are a geek and need a Linux distribution, go for it. That doesnt mean that this distribution is without problems. But those who opt for Linux in the first place should know how to solve the problems.For the rest of us - just stick to Windows - life is much better that way, as much as competitors of Microsoft might hate it."
1,Nothing Fancy,"It seems to be nice as far as silk goes, but I was surprised about the plain look. It is nothing fancy. It had little pieces of thread that needed to be cut. But it seems to wear and wash well. Also, it can be condensed to a small and light size for travel. The orange color came off onto the sheets!"
5,Well Worth the price to upgrade,"Just 2 years later, this newer GARMIN is much better, faster and works right out of the box! No software to load. Re-maps almost instantly. Touch screen is easy to see. Simple to use and the price is in line with the features. Why pay a much higher price for stuff you don't need and obviously won't use. No overkill here!"
2,A major step backwards in quality,"I decided to purchase this game because my Links98 was having erratic results when I purchased a new computer with a 1.4gig processor. I hoped that the new game would respond better to mouse clicks. Well - that's the only thing I can say good about the game. Other than that, the graphics are horrible. Making an internet connection is next to impossible. It takes over a gig of hard-drive space if you install it in its entirety, and it will not load your older LS games, even though the advertising says it will.I would only recommend this to someone I didn't like."
3,not so bad afterall,"Better graphics? Not on my three year old compaq.The players look like cartoon characters and the courses look artificial.I have had every Links since the 98 version.This is the first disapointment.I am not impressed with the real time swing.Back to the 2001 for me.Since writing the above, I have installed a 32mb video card.This has made a big difference, and I even installed the 2003 Champion courses."
2,Horrible.,"So disappointed by this video! The explanations are horrible, and scattered all over the place. Do not waste your money."
1,"For light use, short bursts only","I purchased this for use in making handmade soap. I used it at the beginning of the batch for 30 minutes straight on the low setting, after which, it ceased functioning, and could not be restarted, even after cool down. Fortunately, I had a paint mixer attachment for my hand drill, and that worked great."
5,Good Message,The performances in this movie are high quality. All of the players went on to do exceptional things.
2,Not my favourite Lo'Jo CD,"First, I would like to say that I can sit down and listen to all of Lo'Jo's previous CDs one after the other and enjoy them all while being impressed by their European-North-African style charm and variety. Not too many artists I can say this about. The live album is an excellent compilation. This one continues their musical explorations with some modernisations. I have had it for a while and have tried hard to like it. Unfortunately, it just does not grab me in the way the previous recordings do. Maybe it is the sound with modern percssion etc, perhaps the melodies / songs aren't as strong as before. Either way I don't get drawn into the exotic Lo'Jo world in the way I have previously. So I am disappointed but please check out the other CDs. They are great!"
3,if only it would'nt breakdown,I purchased this Toshiba 3months ago and really loved it...then a month ago the dvd-r drive went bad...it was replaced and I became happy again...but that was shorted lived because yesterday(1/30/03) the wireless connection stop working and was told by Toshiba that the wireless card has to be replaced (free of charge of course). This makes me wonder whats next. I really like this machine and maybe I just got stuck with a lemon. I hope this is the end of the repairs. I would really advise everyone that they take out an extended warrenty (as I did) expecially if this is a sign of things to come.
5,Wonderful,"This book is a great asset to my Nanny craft collection. I love it, and it gives me more ideas for the children I Nanny."
5,Simply Outstanding!!!,"Punish the Sinners is simply an outstanding novel. It gives the reader a sense of urgency. I actually found my palms to be sweating while reading about Peter Balsam's (the main character)thoughts concerning his ""bad"" feeling about the town and his old friend Monseignor Vernon. I could not put the book down. I can honestly say that after reading The Blackstone Chronicles and then Punish the Sinners, I cannot wait to read all of John Saul's books. Saul is a master at placing you the readers into the main character's mind. Happy reading!"
3,somewhat slow....,"The movie starts off very slow. There isn't alot of tension or edge of your seat moments. There is not alot of gore or violence. Summer is looking for her father and ends up meeting a boy who she hooks up with and ends up spending the night with him. Things appear normal until his mother is outside his door listening to him fornicate with Summer. The ""creepiness"" the boy possesses is his love for gardening; however, it never really explains why he must have garden angels. It explains his reasoning for his garden but not the angels. The mother and son seem to have a ""thing"" going on between them (yes, they kissed). The father is more sadistic than the son and simply kills women for amusement. The twist was predictable since the film didn't focus on other characters. I did find the end rather amusing and ended up giggling since it had a somewhat happy ending."
1,TERRIBLE ACTING,"This movie could have been good, but the acting was SO bad I turned it off after 20 minutes (I can't even believe I watched it that long) I was hoping something would change, the plot was a good, but COULD not even get into any of the characters. I don't recommend this movie."
4,Stay With It...,"SUMMER'S MOON (aka: SUMMER'S BLOOD) starts out rather slowly, seemingly going nowhere. Thankfully, things pick up around the mid-point, sending this one into berserker-ville! Ashley Greene's character is believable (while having little to do) as the tough, cynical daughter, searching for her father. Her captors, consisting of yet one more family of weirdos, is fairly menacing. At first, I thought that SUMMER'S MOON was going to be another dull schlocker w/ a captive and her lunatic kidnapper. Well, I was right, sort of... What saves MOON are the veteran actors who play the eeevil parents (Barbara Niven and Stephen McHattie). They are excellent in their roles, especially McHattie who nearly foams at the mouth w/ sadistic glee! Though the ""twist"" can almost be predicted by opening credits end, it still adds to the story, making the final third quite enjoyable. Also, the climax is great, and makes up for a lot of the early tedium. Ms. Greene redeems herself nicely..."
1,The Britany of Movies!!,"I'd give this a 0 in a horrible moment. This is the lip-sincer of movies. Like Britany Spears Bimbo Beat Blather, this is talentless, directionless, visionless, meaningless and has absolutely nothing to say about nothing. The ""acting"" if that's what you call it these days is atrocious, I could do a better job, and I am no ""actor""."
4,"MANY PLUSES, FEW MINUSES!","Very few people would be surprised to see that this latest version of ""Red Hat Linux"" has most of the attributes that make ""Suse Linux 8.1 Professional"" thick: including OpenOffice and Ximian Evolution.The ease with which this OS copes with a multi-system environment makes it a top bargain for anyone gunning for a Linux-based server. Its graphical interface is wonderful!Although I'm aware that most hardware producers favour Windows more than they do Linux, I was still disappointed to discover that there is no support for MP3. There is also, no room for what should have served as my default CD Burner."
3,"Great idea, bad examples","This book must be one of those books that gets a new cover each time a new VB release is issued. The explanations are solid, but the examples STINK with ERROR AFTER ERROR. There is a patch for a couple of the errors, but not all the ones I have found. Maybe the VB6 version will clean it up. I'm disappointed."
2,Numerous Errors,"After complaining to the editors about the numerous coding and syntax errors and having a CD with blank data, I finally had to return the book for a full refund. Please be forewarned that this book will NOT give you a mastery unless you have the patience to weed through numerous inconsistencies...."
4,time to buy a ruler!,"wow, this is really small! i don't recomend for your tongue. unless you are super tiny and have a teeny tongue. i haven't worn a barbell in years but i knew the hole was still open. i needed something with a small guage and small balls at the ends. it is small all right! looks more like a eyebrow barbell-thing. my own fault, i am bad with measurements.pull out your ruler before you decide!!"
4,a carefully written novel for perceptive readers,"This book combines a number of uncommon qualities that will reward the patient reader: it is beautifully plotted, with no loose ends or errors in continuity; it is based on meticulous (but not flaunted) research into the subjects depicted; and it realistically portrays aspects of modern life that rarely draw the attention of serious novelists. Here, as in his other major works, Cozzens focuses on people's jobs -- how we make it through the day, dealing with the unattractive challenges life throws at us. Admittedly, his outlook on many topics is old-fashioned (something he acknowledged), but he generally appears to be someone honestly trying to look at the world as objectively as he can. (If one reads his major works in chronological order, it becomes clear how this striving for objectivity enabled him to grow beyond many of the prejudices of his class.) A priceless view of one aspect of modern American life."
1,Porter-Cable is not the quality it used to be.,"Porter-Cable has a history of building quality tools. Unfortunately that is not the case any more. I have purchased several nail guns and compressors and have always been shocked at how fast they break. Granted, they are cheap. If you only want it for a one time use and can't rent better tools it might make sense. If you want a tool that won't break in a couple of months, stick with Senco, Dewalt, or Ridgid."
3,Guns are great compressor just started leaking,The guns/stapler are great however the compressor started leaking after 2 months of use. I will be calling them today to resolve the issue.
5,Porter Cable CFNBNS Three Nailer and Compressor Combo Kit,Great Investment. I wish I had made this purchase years ago. The tools are very easy to use and appear made very well. I installed various types of molding in a 1500sq foot house in less time than it would have taken to do one room with the traditional hammer and nail technique. No jam or misfires either. Another great Porter Cable product.
4,The Hardys Search For Their Missing Friends,"This review concerns the revised 1962 edition. Frank and Joe are asked to investigate a series of fights occuring in Shantytown, a beach settlement on the outskirts of Bayport, but, soon become involved in a bigger mystery when a local bank is robbed and their friends, Chet Morton and Biff Hooper, disappear. This book was quite good; lots of action with an interesting plot. The beginning of the revised edition is much more exciting than that of the original; however, the second half of the original far exceeds that of the revised edition in terms of excitement and suspence. The original and the revised editions are essentially two different stories, as they are only similar in their basic plot (Frank and Joe's search for Chet and Biff); therefore, I would recommend reading them both."
2,great book terrible version,"If you like Dorothy Sayers you'll like this but get another version, this one has tons of missing words and phrases."
2,Tough to get through!,"For those not familiar with the details of British culture this may be difficult to get through. This story does not seem to have aged well, and some of the cultural references are dated.There are some decent parts, but there are also some very slow sections, that one almost feels like skipping...It reminded me of a school textbook, and seemed a bit preachy.I am sure her later stories may be better, but this was slow and I just couldn't connect with the aloof characters."
2,Poor,"The type in this book is very poor quality. The type size is very small, there appears to be at least one extra line space between each paragraph, there are no indents, and some of the special characters are wrong. Whoever produced this book did the absolute cheapest job necessary to meet legal standards. I am a former typesetter, and I can see that the formatting was just not done properly. I may return it because I'm just not sure I can read the extremely small type without getting a headache."
1,Review of the Createspace edition,This is a review specifically of the createspace print on demand version of this book. The print is extremely small and the typography is terrible. You would be better off ordering an out of print copy from a standard publisher
1,Where's Al Lowe?,"Any Leisure Suit Larry game that didn't involve Al Lowe isn't an LSL game at all. What a shame that Sierra wasn't smart enough to employ him.Message to pointy-haired bosses at Sierra: You can buy the LSL name, you can buy Larry's face, but Al Lowe is the soul of Leisure Suit Larry and if you haven't got him, you haven't got anything."
1,"this game is horrible, no option for negative stars?","anyone who likes this needs to get their head checked, and buy some real games.i have every right to say this because i've beaten all of the previous LSL games which al lowe made. i guess it makes sense that this game sucks, because he had nothing to do with it.spend your money on LSL6 instead, the graffix are simple, but the fun factor is phenomenal!"
1,dumb,"Every time I watch this woman on TV, I end up having to turn the channel. She is not funny, just a harsh and shrill harpy. Dhe evokes pity more than laughter in me."
3,Not up to her usual razor's edge,"I own and enjoy all of Margaret Cho's stand-up comedy DVD's. In my opinion, each one of them has gotten progressively less funny. There is a lack of new material, a lack of real enthusiasm on her part for her humor and her fans ... she seems more like a political activitist that tells a few jokes now. Just not what I'd hoped for, but pretty much what I expected."
4,It's what's on the inside that counts,"An out of the ordinary French film set in Paris and probably best viewed without much foreknowledge of the plot details.The film follows Andre, a man deep in lies and financial debt, who meets a new and (on the surface) very different companion, Angela, who gradually opens his eyes to love and his real self.It's sometimes thought provoking, beautifully shot in black and white, humorous, emotional, and a welcome breath of fresh air alongside the formulaic sequels out of Hollywood."
2,Not what I expected,"It is nice but not very practical, you cannot add or delete pictures, it is not easy to use, it takes a lot of space. PhotoJam 3 does the same and maybe more and it's more versatile, easier and cheaper!"
4,"This revolutionary architect inspired Wright, Le Corbusier,",... and many others talented 19th and 20th century builders. The book is very well written and documented.
2,Have you heard of Javier Solis?,By far nothing comparable to Javier Solis. Not taking anything away from the tenor of OPERA not Ranchera...Lets leave the rancheras for those who are gifted in its style. You want real rancheras listen to MR. Javier Solis.
1,"Hello, Welcome.. come in... good bye","The title of this review says it all.... that is pretty much how the game went for me. Granted the first hour was interesting to look at the houses people built and try out all the gadgets and gizmos but after that it was just an expensive chat room. Sitting at a chess board and 'hearing' Hello, welcome, come on in and thanks over and over is not my idea of a game.... I had a blast building a house, decorating and filling it with everything I possible could but after that... chat room mode set in and I was never into those, even the free ones....."
1,Sims Online Ultimate Review 1000+ people involved,"This game is no game. It is no fun at all especially because of its price 75$ for a cardboard box and for online chat after 3 months. I thought it would be alot more fun then the online virtual chat that im using for FREE, but apparently it ... I dont want to pay money to do something I can do for free....Real simulated chat room0% dumb"
1,not worth it,If you get this game all your going to do is pay a monthly fee to chat! Objects are priced way to high and to get any skills to make money will take you weeks of game play. I played this game for over two weeks strait and it was the same thing over and over. You never get any place and it gets boring real fast. If your really into online chat and want to pay for it then get this game but if you want to play The Sims stick with PS2 or the regular PC game.
4,Very Pleased,"I was afraid the book was not indexed, and would be hard to search, but there is a great functional index at the END of the book. A good compilation and fun to browse if you are a poetry lover like me."
5,Book review,Product was delivered in a reasonable time and in the condition described. I am pleased with my purchase.
3,Fall of Colossus,"I do not read books often, but recently I discovered that Colossus: The Forbin Project was a series of Books. So I bought a used copy of The Fall of Colossus. Frankly, the book is a bit dated. However, it did answer many questions I had after the movie left off. The book was interesting and the writing was very Brittish, but clear and consis enough to follow and keep me interested. I recomend it if you want to find out what happens."
4,Historic Reading,Book is full of insight and careful research. Is a bit slow to read. Warms up in mid-book. A must-read for living historians.
5,Great kids show for all ages!,Tom is Jerry is a perfect show for kids of all ages (and parents too!)I have four kids and usually drive around a few extra friends too. This movie keeps them entertained in the car and they can watch it over and over again. It's timeless and adorable!
1,keyboard & mouse are worse than useless,"I am asked Amazon to arrange a replacement of my faulty item, but they have declined to act since my request 4 months agoThe mouse quickly depleted its rechargable batteries , which did not recharge. I used regular batteries, which worked for a while and then ceased functioning. I bought new rechargeble batteries, but these do not work either.Also, at least one pad on the keyboard is mushy.lin murphy"
2,Not too bad.,"Not a bad product. The narrator goes over the 22 major cards in some detail. The minor cards get a quick incomplete description. For this price I expected more. Each card should have been explained in detail. The descriptions are nothing you cannot get for free on line; but, for audio learners it is good. It is just incomplete and disappointing. The cards that were discussed had good accurate descriptions."
2,Sound is horrible,I like how the picture fills the screen but the sound is really bad. Had it going during a party and several people in the other room asked if people were playing ping pong. It became the joke of the night! Ping pong is exactly what it sounds like. The fire is pretty cool except for the skipping when it loops. If it wasn't for the really loud ping pong sound I would rate it higher. It is so distracting though that I am going to need to buy a different dvd.
1,No show,I would have loved to been able to review this DVD but it never turned up :-( very disappointed!
3,"Not Bad, But Others Under $10 Are Better and Most Have More Options For The Price.","I was looking for a Fireplace DVD to send out as a gift to load of people and wanted to see what this one was like and if it was worth the extra cash. This looked OK but for the price I don't know why I would buy this one over the others with a price under $10.Fireplaces, Fishtank & LavaorFireplace: Visions of Tranquility [Blu-ray] They advertise ""Real Burning Wood Fire"" most of the available DVDs have real burning wood, maybe a funny DVD would be say Real Burning Trash Can? Save yourself some $$$."
2,not the best.,"We like to have something ambient running at bedtime, so I bought this DVD after seeing a few positive reviews. My faith was misplaced. The sound is awful, it does not take up the entire screen (I have a very small flatscreen TV), and the quality is pretty awful. It is jumpy, short, and it looks like a good deal of the fire is CG. Not what I want in a ""real wood burning fire"" since, again, I'm pretty sure it's at least partially digital.Skip this one, folks. I'm now on a quest for a proper fireplace DVD."
4,Close to being the real thing,"Received my Fireplace DVD and was amazed at how real it not only looks, but sounds. Put it on the big screen TV, turned out all the lights, and would have sworn I had the real thing... great buy for a great price....If you don't have a fireplace and want the effects, this is it....Thank you Amazon"
3,"Excellent perfume, bottle not fresh","This has been my favorite light cologne since college when a friend shared it. The bottle I purchased was the real deal, but was such an old bottle that the first 10 sprays or so didn't smell like the real thing, and the packaging did not have bar codes or other items that the manufacturer added at least 5 years ago.Once I got past the first several sprays, it started smelling like itself, which is delightful, light, and lovely. Perfect for summer. If I could rate the scent, it would be 10 stars. The age of the bottle I received for a large sum of money, gets 3."
4,Behind the masterpiece,"The other posted reviews here all do some justice to this book. It was not the overwhelming and unforgettable event of Wyoming Stories but I was glad it was published and happy to have read it. For one thing, it underscores the acheivement of the first volume. The stories have their own interest but like the minor works of a great genius composer we gain insight from our time with them into the great accomplishment. we see haow much it took to produce.As one reviewer said, they do not bring on the great poetry and technicolor of the first ones but illuminate a variety of human types we might pass on our tourist visits and never have the imagination or empathy to imagine a life for.Flannery o'Conner would have loed the trailer stories and the people."
3,Funny but disappointing,"Considerably weaker than Wyoming Stories 1. Proulx is clearly in touch with Wyoming's geography and culture, and she creates some laugh out loud moments, but the endings to her stories are let-downs."
2,Loud screamy voice,So wanted the audio version of her good teachings. Sad to hear the voice of this version is way too screamy and imposing. Sad as the message is interesting.
5,The Dynamic Laws of Prosperity,This is a book I read in the 80's? Helped me make a decision about my life...Subconsciously I have been practicing these principles ever since...with positive results.Now it was recommended to me again...This time I will be deliberate in manifesting the life I want to end on! Smile.I would call this a MUST read every decade!
1,splitting at seams,"These covers were ordered and put on a new FJ Cruiser in mid-2007. It is now May 2009 and they are really in bad shape. They, due to the heavy, shiny threads they are woven from, separate from the seams, shredding, I guess, would be the appropriate word. I have much cheaper, different type and brand on my Toyota Tacoma, for a longer period (at least another year longer) and they are still are holding up, with no splitting etc. These Coverking's are expensive, and were supposed to be heavy-duty, but ended up being a waste of a lot of money."
4,Nice Mouse,Has a lot of neat features. Plug and play worked well. Not sure why its bluetooth and has a dongle to plug in for other wireless use...
2,"Fun, But Too Many Flaws","Sure, I had fun reading this book. But the Amazon reviewer who termed it ""highly speculative"" is understating the case. Opinion, conjecture, hearsay, and speculation too often take the place of thorough, solid documentation. And unlike many other Amazon reviewers, I found McLellan's tone off-putting. She alternates between patronizing her subjects (the very notion of calling them ""my girls,"" for instance) and setting them up primarily as sources of voyeuristic thrills for the herself and the reader. Is the book dishy and intriguing and flamboyant? You bet. But is the topic of lesbianism in Hollywood well-served here? I don't think so."
4,Wonderful CD - even if you don't like the banjo,"This a great CD - easy going, yet compelling. This one is more in-line with his Nashville CD (recommended) but is a bit more traditional. Like all of his CD's, the songs are the key. Whether they are covers of Carter family standards (Single Girl, Married Girl) or any of the originals, they have that dark, mysterious, eery, and beautiful quality that Bill Frisell always manages to capture. I have loved Bill Frisell for years - but recently discovered Danny Barnes - who is, like Frisell, an incredibly gifted musician. Dig his guitar solo on Cluck Old Hen, (reprise). The guy is a killer companion to Bill Frisell. Serious chops.If you don't like the banjo - open your ears... the guy can play!"
3,some real highlights some real forgettables,"When the guitar is in the spotlight, as in ""John Hardy was a Desperate Little Man,"" I'm right there. When the banjo starts taking the lead I want outta there, fast. The austere sincerity of Frisell's guitar does not mix well with the winking, gap-tooth grin of the banjo."
1,Make sure this is what you want,"Stupid me, I saw the cover (Julie Andrews in the apron with blue sky and lots of grass) and thought it was ""The Sound of Music"" NOT The Sound of Movies. Product label got me and I bought something I didn't want."
4,Pretty Good,"I read everyone's reviews about this album as well as also the Pitchfork review, which raves about this peice of work. I have to say, I went in expecting A LOT. Everyone proclaimed that it was by far the album of the year and a heck of an experience. I was a tad dissapointed. This amazon page says that customers who bought this also bought Funeral by Arcade Fire, as well as Bright Eyes, so I expected something in that general area. What I found was something totally different.On some songs, Sufjan sounds a little like a male version of Frou Frou. There are yet those songs that sound like Broadway musicals. On some songs, there are choruses where women sing; that was the only annoying thing I found about this CD.The music sounds pretty original and folksy, yet a little on the safe side.Overall, this is a great listen, and you will surely enjoy a lot of it, just don't expect it to be the greatest album ever, which the hype seems to suggest."
5,beautiful,Possibly better even than 69 Love Songs and f#a#~. The songs make you want to weep they are so beautiful. I love it; so does the wife (she rarely agrees); so do my friend's kids. I bought this purely on the strength of reviews on these pages and have since bought multiple copies for other people. Check out the label: asthmatic kitty.
4,well done,"got this one cuz I heard ""Night Zombies"" on the radio. I thought that the song was outstanding, and the rest of the album by and large lives up to the high standard of ""Night Zombie"". It kind of made me mad that the one UFO sighting he sings about was the one in Highland. Dig deeper Sufjan, the most famous UFO sighting was in Millstadt bout 10 years ago. They did an expose about it on ABC for chrissake!"
1,"hey y'all, i just heard an iranian or sumthin' in my durango","look bone-diddlies, im sorry, but this guy really licks the ashtray. album titles benefitted(?) by the thesaurus, lackluster songwriting, 60-year redundant melodies, gimmeyabreak. but as long as pitchfork gives it above, i don't know, a number point number and creates a convaluded review, its decent, right? i don't care for your type, and sufjan stevens eats it like a bavarian. listen to pollard, and try to find me a copy of that first UFO album, but this....COME ON!!!!!"
3,Ambitious yet twee...,"Stevens has captured the sound of every familiar melody and wrapped it up in the most precious package. It's Paul Simon does Ssshhhh-Core. Ambitious and Talented, he is ushering in a kinder - gentler genre of music. Fun the first time around then when you start to think about it you want to smash something just to snap out of it.Do not file under ROCK."
4,Love the instrumentals,"The songs are very nice and original. I love the variety of instrumentals on this CD. I am from Illinois, so I like it even more because some of the songs are Illinois related."
2,Wonder Which State Is Next - Despair?,"Anyone who has the sheer courage to attempt an honest song about John Wayne Gacy, Jr. certainly deserves a second look, unfortunately, when you look again, it's still a train wreck. One cannot deny the touching sincerity exhibited by Sufjan Stevens in his ambitious work, which features highly original and entertaining titles if nothing else. However, the delivery, the voice, the style, and the overall sensibility are cloying, morbid, and dour, a quagmire oozing precious self-pity. Listen to it for a while, then pound nails through your hand for a while. See if you can tell the difference."
2,2 stars for cleverness,"but you get the feeling he wrote the songs as an afterthought to clever titles.maybe clever the first time through, but I can't imagine why you'd listen again."
1,"Interesting, but not the music....","Some clever stuff...but as far as music goes, I just can't bring myself to enjoy it (with the possible exception of Night Zombies). It escapes me why this has shown up on so many best of 2005 lists."
4,Simply brilliant,This guy is one of the most promising American artists and this album is a great first proof of it.
2,Tries way too hard,"I wanted to like this album. I tried. But I have an idea that in 5 years, no one will remember this record. It reaks of Sufjan Stevens trying to be different. Like the guy at the coffee shop who wears the wool cap and army coat, when it is 100 degrees outside. Like his bio on his web site about being found in a milk crate. Like the horrible long titles of the songs. But most importantly, like the music that just does not grab you. You won't be humming any of these tunes at work.It is not horrible. Just not that great. Don't believe the hype surrounding this album. I would say sample some of the songs. They all sound pretty much alike."
2,Promising but critically flawed,"The games in this package are interesting and potentially addictive. I have purchased several of these games during the past few years and they all suffer from terrible instability; every single one of them is buggy and crashes. The latest game I've purchased (after telling myself not to buy another) is Crusader Kings Complete. Unfortunately, it crashes every 15-30 minutes, rendering the game unusable. There is a patch for Snow Leopard but it crashes as well. (In fact, the notes on their website say if the Snow Leopard patch crashes you should downgrade to the other version that also crashes.)I hope they can figure out the crashes. The games themselves are excellent and have so much promise."
1,Not recommended,"One of the first purchases I've ever had to return (...) but this album is of little value. It is comprised primarily of plastic pages that hold 2x2 coin folders into which the coins must be inserted before mounting. They don't mention that these are required but (conveniently!) include an order blank for them. While these are commonly used by coin collectors the beginning collector, who is among the most likely to buy this product, will not likely have them and will be unable to use the album until they are acquired at an additional cost. Not very thoughtful if purchased as a gift! There are several others on the market and any one of them would be a better selection."
2,End of an era.,"I owned Wolfenstein 3D on my 486, back in 1993. I like first person shooters.I barely played through the introductory level of Q4. Graphics performance is consistently crappy on both my MacBook Pro 17 and my dual G5 2ghz; what systems are they testing?!Big disappointment."
5,A nice poster,The material that it was printed on was of good quality and it was easy to maneuver from place to place if you use the command poster strips.
5,"Cheesy, campy, what more could you ask for?","I happen to like ""bad"" movies...this is a really good bad video. Julie Kavner (aka Marge Simpson), Sharon Gless, and, of course, Don Johnson star in this sequel to the creepy Stepford Wives film. The movie appears to have been made in the late seventies to very early 80's, though the release date is '86. Call in sick to work, lay in bed and watch this really bad movie over and over again."
4,Revenge on DVD,"I am surprised that this is still not available on DVD. There are so many horrid movies and television shows on DVD, why can't this great movie make it to the current medium? I will wait it out for a few more months and then probably purchase the VHS video and attempt to make a DVD copy. Of course my production won't live up to today's standards of HD. LOL."
3,"Ok, but looks a little cheap",Looks fairly cheap. Base is a gray plastic. I guess I expected it to be a little better although it wasnt very expensive either...Also I will let you know that since I gave this as a gift I didnt actually turn it on....
4,tasty choices,"The release of this vintage album of the late 70's to CD shows why Pat Martino is to be revered as one of the greats of jazz guitar. Footprints has everything - classic ballads, Brazillian treats, uptempo tour de forces - all with the brilliant musicianship of Martino. This seminal guitarist, oft forgotten has been playing clubs again after a long U.S. hiatus. Footprints will introduce any jazz guitar fan to the type of treat rarely found in today's jazz recordings. Richard Davis on bass and Billy Higgins on drums can't be beat- end of story - and the arrangements here are so sweet you will find yourself playing this disc time and again. Savor these tunes!"
5,Old book GREAT book,"I was just browsing for a used copy of this book because I never like to be without one to lend. This is one of my favorite books of all time. It is basically ""true crime"" and written in the style of a novel. If you like this genre, you won't be able to put this book down."
5,Should do the trick,"Need it to keep the birds away from my one tomato plant -- and, from the looks of it, now placed over the plant; should do the trick. Thin, strong webbed plastic, easy to work with."
3,Another thumbs down for the samples,"I have to agree with another reviewer who said that the content (speaking of the range of topics) is good, but the examples could've been better. If you like explanations using short sample code with a line-by-line explanation of what's going on, then this book may give you problems. However, if you're a masochist and like a short introduction to 2-3 pages of codes with little to no comments just to illustrate a simple point, then by all means .. jump right in :) I don't completely regret buying this book, as I was able to get some useful information out of it. However, I think it was actually worth maybe half the price I paid for it."
4,"Easy to use, smells good","I got these because my boyfriend has allergies to my cat. My cat is not very cooperative and easy-going, and this is the one product I could use on her without her getting to grumpy. The wipes smell good, and I think it did help with the allergies. I don't think it was a 100% fix, but it definitely helped."
5,Very good book!!,"If you want a deeper relationship with the Lord, this is a great book. There is a section in the front of the book for daily affermations and 3 months worth of devotionals. The scripture is rewritten in first person to personalize it so you can pray it."
1,Book bought,I am concerned - I still have not received my book - could you please folow up please please !!
5,Great Gift,"I love this book! I buy it for all my friends and relatives.It is great for holding thoughts captive. No matter what your situation, this book will help you through it. If you need affirmation, or renewal, or just want to praise and adore our father; this prayer book helps you pray the scriptures for intimacy, insight, clarity, and peace.So many times have I opened this book and found that the daily prayers were exactly what I needed for that days situation. It can be read in sequence, (three month devotional), or used only when necessary. It is structured to be used as a short devotion, or for a lengthy dialogue with the father. Whatever your need, this book will answer it for you."
1,BE CAREFUL !!!!!!! the car is smaller than advertised,"One of the criterias for I chose this car was the SIZE !!!! in the product description was specified 12.6 x10.6 x15.1.When I received the car I could not believe how small is. The real size is: 8""x2.5""x3.5"". I checked the measures and they are not the indicated one in inches or either in centimeters.The car looks nice (I have't tried it because is a present) but is NOT what I wanted.Maybe the scale 1:24 is correct but when you buy something, right on the spot, the scale means nothing..."
2,"Silly, misleading, and offensive trash.","The number of absurd coincidences, cliffhangers, and deus ex machinas required to sustain the plot of this boy scout daydream would challenge anyone's ability to suspend disbelief. I would rate it as slightly less credible than the Wizard of Oz. This silliness spoiled it for me, though I might have loved it if I had run across it at the age of 12. This book does not give any kind of reliable view of World War I. It is a fairytale. Also despite what other reviewers have said, I found the South African apartheid-style racism pervasive and offensive. This kind of thought was no more acceptable in 1916 than it is today, as Gandhi made so eloquently clear at the time."
3,Good,"This book was not VERY good and it doesn't show you how to be invisible. But it shows you how to make some ivisible inks and why it works. It has interesting facts about real spies, and most of the experiments are good. The others just show you what a spy would do. Probably this book would be more intersting for kids younger than 8. Overall, this book is pretty good."
1,Blame the victim,"Terrible acting. Confusing plot. No, I haven't read the book, nor should I have to in order to watch a movie. And the best part, if your a victim of abuse, either sexual or physical, you are the bad guy. Nice going Dekkar, hack."
2,House not to be confused with House with Richard Moll Another Horror Movie.,"I thought the movie had a cliched plot,this type of story has been told before, you expect it to be one thing turns out to be another. that's not to say the movie doesn't have a different vibe to it or that's a horrible movie, it's just the story leads you into another story you didn't expect(typical of movies and sometimes a good thing). the movie didn't really do it for me regardless.(I Did Like the Ending! and how Good triumphs evil)"
3,Good decent horror.,I didn't expect this film to be a good horror movie. I really was surprised. I love sleepers like this.
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"I absolutly LOVE LOVE LOVE the book. I absolutly HATE HATE HATE the movie! They ruined it! A vast majority of the book was terribly altered in the movie. The actors were bad and the movie was very low budget. I even like cheesey-bad horror movies; yet I HATE this one! I would not recommend this to anyone at all. I read the previous ratings, but didn't think a movie could ever be horrible enough that I won't like it. Two thumbs down!!"
2,Disappointed,"My husband had a copy of this book years ago but lost it. He is a fly tieing fisherman and wanted a book that showed how to tie a particular fly and what it should look like as a finished product. His original book from years ago had COLORED illustrations of the finished fly in it. The book I just received from Amazon had black and white pictures in it. The introduction in this book made reference to the beautiful COLORED illustrations, yet they were black and white. You can't tell from the pics in this book whether you have created a good fly or not. He was highly disappointed and I returned the book.My original request to Amazon was ""Is this particular book a fluke or is this now how it is being printed?"" My only response was that I could return the book if I was not satisfied."
3,great book but over priced,Great book with lots of useful data but I was not happy to find the photo/plates were reproduced in Black and White.
1,not for conservatives,"This was too liberal for me. It is speaking about channeling spirits. I'm all for the law of attraction, the law of abundance but this went too far for me. I'm warning conservative christians that they may not like it. Conservative Christians may like Dr. Wayne Dyer's Power of Intention DVD. I did pass Introducing Abraham on to my liberal minded cousin. She may enjoy it without cringing. -Johnson"
1,A masterpeice in deception and fraudulence,"This is truly a masterpiece in deception. Mrs. Hicks, in my view, is not channeling anything at all. She seems to be quite the actor; on the off-chance that she is legitimate then the entity she is channeling is not who or what she thinks it is.Mr. Hicks is a psychological enigma; as he speaks he is reluctant to maintain any amount of eye contact with the interviewer, his conversation frequently wanders and he ends up telling some pointless story that has no relevance to the question he was asked, his mode of speaking is incoherent and meandering plus his voice is grating and quite tedious to listen to."
5,"Inspiring, beautifully filmed DVD.","Having attended Abraham-Hicks workshops over the years, I know it must be hard to capture the magic in the air. But this film maker does just that. The music and images tucked between the talking segments are meditative, and seemed designed to draw you into a relaxed state of connection.It is fun to hear the Hicks talk about their lives. After all this time, you can tell they are still tickled by the presence of Abraham."
5,inspiring,"I watched the movie over and over, it is fascinating!! It makes so much sense to our lifes and the control that we have with our own destiny with the universe. It is an awesome book!! The only issue I had was with Amazon. They double shipped (actualy it was almost quadruple ship)..I am very frustrated not being able to talk to customer service. It was obvious that something had gone wrong in the order process...it really was a nightmare. I was double billed and refused delivery on the duplicate, brought in AMX dispute...I had to cancel all my credit cards connected with Amazaon, because they also charged my debit card they had on file, which they were not authorized to use for that transaction...we shall see who the ethical one will be!"
2,Pointless,"The only way I can describe this book is ""pointless"". I finished it - which says something about the writer's ability. It was interesting in the characterizations and personality interactions but the story really didn't seem to have a point in any of the aspects explored. Overall I considered it a waste of my time."
5,Incredible and joyful early music,"Anyone who likes renaissance dance music will love this disk. The group is superb, and has a large repertoire on CD; although they have taken Europe by storm and tour constantly, their CDs are in very limited availability in the US.Get this before it becomes unavailable as well; you won't be sorry."
1,Practical introduction that doesn't deserve to succeed,"Thanks to san_kalyan for a very honest review.This is the worst book ever published on computers security. Even worse is to compare it with Spafford and Garfinkel's `Practical Unix and Internet Security', a true classic.White-Hat Security Arsenal:... is a trivial and outdated book. Bad structured and totally useless even for beginners.Don't throw your money away. Buy books like 'Hacking Exposed' if you are interested in the basics of computer security."
5,Solitaire at its hilarious best!,"Burning Monkey Solitaire can't really be compared to other solitaire games. Twenty-six different types of solitaire will keep you occupied for years, and the humor will keep you coming back for more. Cute clever characters are entertaining and easter eggs will help relieve frustration in a difficult game. From cheating options to the ability to ""fetch a winnable game,"" the game is customizable beyond belief. This game is recommended to all!"
1,Wrong RAM,"This is not the correct memory module for a Sony Vaio VGN-N220E notebook. I did the search for just that and it produced four results. Three of which all looked identical, but the fourth, the one I ordered, looked longer and thinner. I did not pay attention to the pictures as I was reading the product descriptions. All four shared the exact same description. Thus, my recommendation for replacing RAM is to physically inspect your current RAM module(s) before ordering so something like this does not happen to you."
5,great memory,"I bought Kingston because it has always been dependable. I did not get one of the modules seated properly. Once I did correct that, it worked like a charm! Kingston has never failed me with its quality and lifetime guarantee."
5,Good DDR2 memory,"Actually I had to exchange this memory for the right one for my computer, and the company was friendly, professional and helpful. They sent out the correct memory after return of the this package. I had ordered the wrong type and speed memory for my computer. It works great, and I am using the new memory now. The memory I am using now is one stick of 2GB DDR2 667MHz memory. And it works great."
5,Mental Brilliance!,"Finally, a book that links Mental Illness with the planets that affect us all. Dr. Gibson, writes an intelligent book that gives the reader a new perspective for those who suffer from mental illness based upon planetary placements and time of birth. For families with loved ones who suffer from mental illness, it gives them a scientific explanation and a comforting answer as to why?If you want to read a book that is smart, interesting and on the cutting edge, Read this Book!"
3,What works in Schools,I need this book for a course towards my masters. I see it as a Textbook!Enough saidEva
4,What Works in Schools: Translating Research Into Action,This book is very good and useful. It helped me to do my homework and exam. It is necessary to get more information and knowledge. I recommended it
2,What have they done to my Pooh?,"Thanks to a series of successful books and videos, Winnie the Pooh and his playmates in the 100 Acre Wood have become some of the best-loved characters in children's entertainment. ""Pooh Unplugged,"" by Karen Finley, is a merciless satire of these characters and their world. Pooh and company walking around with graphically portrayed penile erections, wearing bondage gear, and making sexual advances towards each other--this is typical of Finley's work in this book.I have to admit, I found a few of the drawings briefly amusing. But on the whole, I found ""Pooh Unplugged"" to be a cheesy and crude undertaking. Finley's ""satire"" is, in my opinion, simplistic and uninspired.I should note that I do defend Finley's right as an artist to make a parody of anything she wants to mock. But I don't see much of a point to this weak effort, whose main goal seems to be to merely shock."
4,Umm...This is Good.,"Not as good as the second message but still good grassroots hip hop with that distinct Brook-nom sound. Has creative twists, solid imaginative lyrics, and great guitar riffs. Awesome underground stuff along lines of both Blackstar members."
4,Fantastic Changes,The subtext of Changes is aparent to adults when the background is seen as the protypical 50's nuclear family kitchen table pattern. The story revolves around the new nuclear family of the 90's from the perspective of the child. The use of colors keeps the book neutral and universal at the same time. I feel the art work expresses the story more than the words could ever say for a child. The issue is difficult to speak about with children but through this book I think people can find a good starting point to facilitate a dialogue.
2,An unforgiveable sin!,"I LIKE Stuart Woods's books. This one is an engaging story, but it commits two sins.The first is that it violates one of the things I like most best about his books, that the characters and reader are, you'll pardon the expression, on the same page. I suspect most readers will be way ahead of the characters on this one.The second is unforgivable. There is a sequence that goes: ""We have to speak, but not over the phone. Not until we can meet face-to-face, tomorrow."" and the speaker ends up dead before the conversation takes place. Gimme a break! Is there anyone who doesn't know that if s/he says, ""WE HAVE to talk. It's critical. We have to meet in person."" s/he isn't going to be around to meet in person?I'd have given one star, but then someone would almost certainly complain, ""You gave one star because of that?!"" Well, yeah, and I stand by it. But, for you, two stars!"
4,Kept me interested,"This is definately one of the better Stuart Woods novels that I have read. It kept me interested from beginning to end. The plot seemed to start fairly early on and kept on track until the end. The main character, Wolf, sort of seemed a little off course at times but I am not certain if that was due to the characters mental state or the writting itself. I think the biggest surprise in the novel is the lack of Ed Eagle, the lawyer that will become the repeat character for future novels. It also seemed at times that some small events mirrored those in other Stuart Woods novels. Overall though, a very enjoyable book."
3,Display needs work,"The display on this unit is hard to see during the day in shaded areas. It's easy to see in direct sunlight which a marine radio should be, but mine is set up in a shaded area and it's very hard to see whats displayed. It works great at night due to display illumination. Also the source button is to close to the volume knob and often times I hit that button while trying to adjust volume while rolling and bobbing with the waves on the ocean. On the good side it's easy to use and sounds great...when I could see the display."
1,No description,This product/seller does not describe what they are selling. I was looking for a mobile TV screen for my Gamecube and I got in the mail something totally different.
1,Out Dated,No where did it mention that the travel guide was printed in 1998. I may find the photos useful but everything else is outdated!
1,JUNK,bought this unit and used it once then the tray jamed sent it back they never receieved unit IF you don't mind talking to every out of the USA then your in for a treat never got a new unit I have to buy another on (but certinly (NEVER Philips)
1,Kindle version of naves topical bible,"The kindle version of naves topical bible is not a good buy, I would call it useless but I like the hard cover. I find this version extremely tedious to use because there is no search function or active table of contents...much work (preferably an improved download) needs to be done before I could recommend this to anyone."
2,Not Kindle-friendly,Having no table of contents is a major detriment to the value of this purchase. Let's hope they remedy this in a timely fashion.
3,Naves Topical Bible,"Its hard to get used to, since I am used to book form.I expected longer explanations or verses to help me find what I am looking for."
4,medical genetics,"I think the book is fine,but there ought to be detailed explanations about various genetical disorders in human genes."
3,All right.,"Leigh Evans is one of the most cynical heroines I have ever read about, maybe too cynical. Michael St. Claire, once a young street kid, now is a powerful property deceloper and this is how he meets Leigh. I had trouble identifying with either the hero or the heroine and did not find this book all that interesting. Both characters have painful ghosts to overcome and emotional traumas from the past undermine this prospective relationship. Many might find this book a good read, but I found myself bored half way through the book. I don't know why, because this is the type of book I usually like to read."
2,Did I miss something?!,"Was there a deadline that needed to be met? The ending was so abrupt that it left me totally dissatified. It started out pretty good as a relationship-character story. All of a sudden all the little subcharacters (Shamus/Barbara; Jake/Sheila, etc.) had to be tied into nice little endings except for Leigh and Michael. For all of Leigh's independence, her mere acceptance of Michael's influence on her growing client list was unacceptable. Sure they love each other, but there were still unresolved issues. To be honest, when I got to the end of this book, I threw in on the floor in disgust. How unfilling it turned out to be. I have read Ms. Hohl's other books and I have never felt like this before."
5,More than just a spy novel,"Maybe I'm biased because I grew up near Evansville, Indiana, and have seen first-hand many of the landmarks that provide the setting for this book, but I found this work an absolutely pleasant surprise. I didn't have high hopes simply because the trailers made it sound like a spy novel. It's a spy novel I couldn't put down. It also dives into the thought processes and propaganda machines of Nazi Germany, enlightening the reader as to why history turned out the way it did. This is one I won't forget for a while."
5,What about Mark Lee?,"After reading all the reviews I'm amazed That nobody mentioned Mark Lee's performance.He ""is"" the movie. That's one of the most moving and nuanced portraits that I've ever seen. I watched the movie for the first time as a child And still today the last scene haunts me. The movie is beautifully shot,and the acting is great;But Lee's acting is what carries It,and I'll always wonder why he didn't become a major star."
4,Gallipoli - Over The Top Cannon Fodder,"I just added this one to my collection. A great film. Mel Gibson at his best. A bit over the top with the attitude towards the British Officers. None the less, the fact remains that volunteering for a comabat unit, with all the idealistic notions that war is a glorious affair will get one killed. Throughtout history soldiers have been sent charging forward to meet certain death, as an acceptable loss. This is one of the films I would recommend to a parent trying to discourage a son wanting to volunteer to go off to war. Born On The Fourth of July, Platoon, and Article 99 and also serve as a warning that sometimes even surviving doesn't end the horror. These people will get you killed."
4,"Great Movie, Bad Soundtrack","Wonfully crafted film, with fine performances. Beautiful cinematography that captures the surreal quality of war. This movie should be re-released with a new soundtrack, and then I would give it 5 stars. What was Peter Weir thinking when he agreed to the score?"
5,Postscript: Too real to be invented,"And if you think the climax of the movie, the charge by the Australian Light Horse at The Nek, is too ludicrous, too horrible, too absurd to be true, too insane to have ever been allowed to take place, well.... it happened, and it happened just as it is portrayed in the film. Such is the madness of war."
2,Smells Very Funny - Not Fresh,"When the product description said ""unboxed"" - I did not think that meant it would also not smell like the fragrance of Beautiful.I gave it 2 stars for arriving fairly quickly.Bad product choice if you want the real deal.Too much of a hassle to return - but a terrible product."
1,Oh my gawd!,"This movie is LOW BUDGET in capital letters! The acting is a horrendus. The direction is scattered and I don't know what's going on. This is the kind of movie that would have been featured on Mystery Science Theater if there was some sci-fi involved in it. I only rented this because it had Lela Rochon as the main character. Unless you are one of those viewers who appreaciate unintentional laughs and campiness, don't let the cover of this video sucker you into renting it."
3,"decent, cheap tires","it is evident why they are so very cheap--they inflate unevenly, and a had a noticeable difference in the difficulty of getting them to fit into the rims compared to regular priced tires. but that said, they haven't blown out on me yet. i doused them in soapy water to make them fit in in the rims properly and overinflated them at first, they seem to be working."
2,not that great,"Well thought this was going to be a really tough tire. But not, it was very easy to get flats & finally it died a slow death. So will not be getting any more of this brand."
2,Not a &700 c TIRE,"i wanted a 700 c tire . so i put it in and all these tires popped up. So thinking it was what i wanted(bec i put 700c tire). i ordered it, a week later of no riding i get the tire. so not happy when it didn't fit on my bike. upset, take this tire out of this category, looks like a great tire tho"
5,Warm relationship between a person and spirit,"This book gives the reader an insight into a loving relationship between a spirit and JZ Knight. The book shares the warmth, emotion and vision of Ramtha to the world through the relationship with JZ Knight. A must read."
4,Dated but timeless,"This book was written in the opening days of WWII. As such the language is dated but IMO that only adds to its charm. The author speaks in generalities which while the premise is correct does not do a great deal to instruct.If you are looking for a definitive work on sniping then ""The Ultimate Sniper"" by Maj John Plaster is your best choice."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!,"DO NOT BE FOOLED WITH THE TITLE OR DESCRIPTION OF THIS DVD. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE F-16!!!!! IN FACT, THERE IS ONLY ABOUT 15 SECONDS OF FOOTAGE AND TALK OF THE F-16. WORST DVD I'VE EVER BOUGHT!!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
4,Two excellent ghazals,"""Yun Guzar Raha Hai"" is beautifully written by Nida Fazli and Jagjit has sung it as only he can. It is a new favorite of mine. The second Ghazal that stands out is ""Rukh se Parda"". This is a studio version of a ghazal that Jagit has sung live - I prefer the live version, but this one has an extra sher. The rest of the ghazals are average."
3,Good Fiction,"This is a good fictional story, well written but I like his earlier work 'Lives of the Saints' much better, from story development and plot prspectives."
2,Strange texture and unpleasant taste,"I ordered this box of chocolates as a Valentine's Day gift for my wife, who can't eat dairy products. I was disappointed in the quality. The chocolate is soft but crumbly -- it's not chewy. It's an odd sort of texture for chocolate. And the flavor is just strange: It reminds me of mushrooms (really!). Obviously, I wasn't happy with this purchase."
1,Day 3 and it's already leaking ink...,"I paid 50 bucks for a pen that is already leaking on its third day of use. The craftsmanship is shoddy. The packaging itself has nicks on it. The pen is leaking from the silver ring above the first one. I've had to use scotch tape on it so that it doesn't keep staining my fingers. The box says made in China, and well quite frankly, the product seems to be exactly that, made in China.I always thought Cross was suppose to be a good brand of pens, but I now know they aren't. The problem for me is I ordered 3 of these pens and one ball point one all at the same time so I could give a few of them away as gifts. What am I going to do now? This bites."
2,Tedious look at 16th president,"I am an 8th grade teacher and bought this video with the Lincoln bicentennial and my students in mind. It is so tedious and the narration so monotone that I could hardly get through it. In fact, I fell asleep about 20 minutes in. Part of the reason I chose this over other options was it was fairly short and could be seen in a couple class periods, but as it turns out, I did not use it at all."
2,A Disappointment...,"very limited information about Nova Scotia. I have used many guide books in the past and this one was a real disappointment ! In some regards actually found the AAA guide to be more useful,,,"
3,"Only Used The Nova Scotia Section, Which Was Helpful!","We carried this book in the car with us when we visited Nova Scotia, and found that it had some useful information and plenty of details. We didn't rely on this book alone, and in fact found ourselves looking at other sources of information regularly. So if you want to carry just one guide, this may not be the one.One point: we tried to follow the directions given in the book for Blue Rocks and they weren't correct. We did eventually reach the rocks, which were OK but nothing as great as the author made them sound.I would recommend this book for people going to Nova Scotia who don't mind also checking other sources of information.For more of my reviews please search for goldenrulecomics on squidoo.com."
3,In my opinion...,It seems this is more about God than a diet. I haven't gotten through much of the book and it could be that. Maybe the diet stuff is later in the book. I don't care how this diet came about as much as I want to know how to help myself. Just my opinion!! -M
1,"yeah, right","i won this book at a local church raffle. At first I wondered how this food tied in with my religion and how it made me healthier, then I realized it didn't. Buy the alphabet of manliness instead and eat beef jerky."
5,Excellent,"Excellent, Amazing!! Tried and true. This book gives a commmon sense approach to eating and staying healthy. I have already experienced improved health/resolved symptoms after 3 weeks (even with some of my own modifications). God has created our bodies so amazing! It is wonderful to experience your bodys own self healing by changing your diet and exercise habits."
1,Wrong disk enclosed..and without it virtually worthless,Although entertaining.. the production of this book was obviously very sloppy...Most of the text refers to an enclosed CD rom .. unfortunately the CD rom attached bears no relationship to the book.. and of course the Web site of the publisher and the author are let us say less than helpful.
1,Only sent one rat - does not respond to query!,"My girlfriend ordered these love rats to be sent to me for my birthday, one of them showed up but the other was missing.I contacted the company but did not get any response. While the one rat is kind of cool - it clearly says they come in pairs.Kind of a rip-off if you ask me, my girlfriend is pretty much devastated that only one of the couple arrived."
4,Definitely Maybe,"I can't find the words to describe this book. If you're big into the teenage dream of obsessions, manipulations, and inevitable consequences, you'll adore this book. Canty has a knack for holding your attention. Kenny's life is filled with the sorrows of living and he goes in search of happiness. You are drawn into his poetic thoughts, and you will see the beauty in life. If you are looking for a Fairy Tale, this is not your story. There are some graffic moments but what is a good story without them. If the real world begs your attendence, come on in. This one is a keeper. For reference of raw thoughts, reality, and passion."
3,Love and Hate relationship,"I bought this book at a library sale. At first (chapter 1 and 2) I thought I would not finish it as it was not grabbing my attention. By the time I did finish it I was sorry it ended. A good book about English minor royalty and how they lived a couple of centuries ago. The family dynamics could be this century. Also, the fooling around, people now act like its new but its been here for centuries. All in all a good read."
5,Make a little carpenter happy,"We gave this tool pouch to my 2 1/2 yr. old grandson when his little sister was born. He carries all his tools in it all day. Excellent quality, durable, and so much more than I expected. Thanks for bringing us a quality product at a reasonable price."
1,Made in China!,"This was a very poor quality product. The leather was very cheap looking, and the sawing done by somebody paid $1 a day.Spend a few more dollars for a better quality product."
3,Its worth the money but...,"I bought this set for the kids to use in the back yard. It is not too hard to set up, even for one person, but the poles are a bit flimsy. By the time I get the net looking like it should look, the tension lines are very tight and the poles are seriously flexing. Also, the plastic stakes, though very common, are easy to break while pounding them in or pulling them out of hard ground.Overall, this is a very inexpensive way to get a basic volleyball set-up for a party or some other limited/infrequent use. If you want to have it set up for a long time or put it up and take it down alot, then you will want to invest in a better set as I don't feel this one will last."
3,Propaganda,"Not as scholarly as Team of Rivals. Gossipy and interlaced with personal opinion. Reporting of the oppression of blacks and women and the ""wonderfulness"" of Eleanor Roosevelt and her projects lacks objectivity. The gossipy style, opinion and lack of balance detract from the truth being related."
4,A piece of history,"Extraordinary blend of historical events and the people who led and lived the years, the months, the weeks and the intimate moments of this time."
5,Well Written and Researched,"This book is beautifully written. It is a deeply researched historical work that leaves the reader thirsting to continue reading it until s/he has reached the last page. Doris Kearns Goodwin has written a narrative account of one of America's most difficult periods: World War II. She is not only a great historian but a great writer. I particularly enjoyed Goodwin's portrayal of Eleanor Roosevelt. This book is further strengthened by Goodwin's empathetic treatment of issues related to Jews and the Holocaust, Blacks and integration, and women and the job market. For all those who enjoy this book, I suggest that they follow it by reading Goodwin's ""Johnson and the American Dream."""
4,Kindle Transcription OCR Sub-Optimal,"I loved the content of the book; however the optical character recognition (OCR) conversion of this book is poor. For example, ""100,000 troops"" is converted to ""100, troops"". Additionally, the ""rn"" letter combination sometimes converted to ""m"" leading to issues with names.I hope that the publisher revises the scan and issues a new revision.The book otherwise, I couldn't put down. Doris writes magically and the book is wonderful. The weight reduction using the Kindle outweighed the issue with the OCR, leading to a 4 stars review."
2,Who Edited This Book?,"When she discusses the Japanese losses at the battle of Midway she states the Japanese lost 4 aircraft carriers (true), 1 heavy cruiser (true), 3 battleships (completely, totally false). Who's supposed to edit this stuff? For a supposedly top notch historical book that's an absurd error to get through."
3,Mailing was too late for trip...,"I ordered this book with the understanding that there was sufficient time for it to be received before we left on vacation. No quarrel with the book selection, but the mailing date mysteriously changed when the order was confirmed. Unfortunately, the ""new"" mailing date was just about two weeks later than what was advertised."
4,Good Wrench,This wrench torqued a caterpillar head at 320 ft/lbs.20 ft/lbs past the last mark (by hand).Wrench does not flex or bend.Would not recommend a cheater bar as the lock ring and the end of the wrench look like plastic.Other than that it seemed to not be accurate all the time.I pulled 320 ft/lbs in 10 lb increments starting at 70 ft/lbs until 320 ft/lbs.It seemed to pull to far without clicking.I would push the wrench back till the rachet clicked and pull again and it would immediately click.With this in mind I can work with this wrench.Great for the price.It torqued my cat head which bends 3/4 breaker bars like pretzels.
5,great cd,I have been a fan of arcangel from the start in the early 80. and was relly happy to see that jeff continues the magic and metaphisical experence of the mucis .

2,Deseptive information from Actron,"Unfortunately, I did my homework after my purchase, it comes with bad soft ware as my computer can not locate the auto scanner as a device so I can update. I purchased this unit and it only has information upto 2003 I bought it in January of 2010 and I CAN NOT update it on he internet. My research into on the internet comment reflect alot of people have this problem and ACTRON does not stand behind there product and fix it. I AM BUMMED!"
3,questions about the product,"I want to know if this Actron CP9190 Elite AutoScanner Pro Diagnostic Code Scanner Kit (Includes CP9185 Base Scanner, OBDI & OBDII Cables with Hard Case)can be used to check JEEP VEHICLES.I have a mechanical shop in Venezuela for to repair several Jeep Vehicles.We would appreciate you rush answer.RegardsArcel Yanez"
4,Review of Actron 9190,I found the 9190 to be a great tool. It provides all the data I was looking for and displays in graph form data streems that I was needing to see. The Snap On scantools are much more exspensive and the Actron makes looking into ones own car service affordable. Thanks Actron
1,Diagnostics equip?s,"My fiance has been wanting a good diagnostic tool for a quite sometime. He has a very basic Actron scanner, but I want to get him something much better. He wanted Actron still, but after the reviews I am finding on the internet, I would love advice from you guys on a different product. I remember him mentioning at one point that he wants something that reads ABS codes. I can't afford anything over $400 to $500 (max). I know that probably doesn't give me many options for the really nice ones, but just want to get him something that will do what he wants and more. So please help!!"
4,Good MP3 Player,"Overall, it's a good value for price. I have been using this product for more than a week now. Though the documentation is poor, the product seems to be sound technically. The transfer speed from PC to MP3 player is not 480Mbps(as should be for USB 2.0 device) but 10-12 Mbps. Anyway that is something you can ignore as you do not copy files frequently. I have not changed batteries so far even I hv played it for more than 6 hours or so. FM radio is good. Have not tried recorder. Also have not bought SD card yet. The connection to XP is smooth. No issues. I gave it 4 start for two reasons i) Poor documentation ii) Data traansfer Speed."
5,Lovely book,"I already have this book. I am getting it for my friend's kid. Rich in story, rich in character. They don't have stories like these any more :)"
1,no 400 Firewire Cable!,"Even though this product is touted as s 400/800 firewire, it only comes with a 800 firewire cable. My imac will only support a 400 firewire connection. How FRUSTRATING to open the box, think I could easily plug and play, and find out that because I didn't see the ""fine print"" the drive didn't come with a NECESSARY CABLE.It might as well have come without a switch to turn it on.It is now a useless piece of metal on my desk, taking up room and necessitating the grief of repacking, and returning."
5,awesome stuff,This CD is a must have for anyone interested in free jazz. Booker Little plays with such ingenuity!
1,I wanted to like it ..............................,"I liked Judy Collins for years before I got around to buying this album. And now I know why I waited years. She is a good singer when she is concentrating, but only ordinary when she's not. I am still in awe of what she achieved on the first verse of ""Amazing Grace"", but not nearly as happy with the other verses, to the point where I would rather find a better version.Just like I did with my other favorite recording of hers - ""Someday Soon"". The version by Suzy Bogguss is vastly superior. And I think Joni Mitchell's version of ""Both Sides Now"" is wearing much better than Judy's. And I would rather hear Leonard Cohen singing ""Suzanne"". Judy did these artists an immense favor by popularizing their music, but I don't think she is standing the test of time. Maybe some of today's great voices could be convinced to do a ""Songs Of Judy Collins"" album and give a brighter shine to some of her better originals."
2,Judy is great but the Elektra CD is awful,"I was stunned by how bad this CD sounds. I'm no expert, so I can't give you a precise description with proper terminology. Suffice it to say it's a bad job of transferring the recordings to CD. I later bought the Gold version, and the difference is like night and day. Judy Collin's voice is too wonderful to let this awful CD prevent you from really hearing her. The Gold version is worth the extra money."
3,The Rainbow Trail by Zane Grey,It took a little while to get interesting but it finally did grab my attention. The last few discs are the best.
5,the titans,"The Titans, by John Jakes: This is the forth in the series The Kent Family Chronicles. This and the others in this series should be required reading in our American Schools. Though novels they give realism to our American history from the very begining . Jakes has used real people and events and spiced it with the ""Kent"" family participating in the growth of our country. I'm only sorry making a living precluded my reading earlier in life."
2,Boring techno-pop,"2 1/2Like a mediocre combination of Air and Daft Punk, cheesy synth-lines and sometimes-catchy pop structures offer a solid but uninspiring listen. The duo's healthy variety keeps all these plain compositions afloat as a disc, but the songs up close are all shades of weak."
2,Not worth the money,"I grew up thinking that Cross pens were ""the thing to have."" My relatives gave them as gifts for graduation and so on. Recently I decided to buy myself one after having used disposable pens for years, and I'm very disappointed. This pen was beautiful when I got it, but after two weeks in my purse it already had several scratches in the enamel that were deep enough for the black underneath to show through. (All I keep in my purse is sunglasses, wallet, phone, keys, and pens, so the keys must be guilty.) Also, it has started skipping although the ink cartridge is not empty yet.I'm really disappointed in this product. Cross should tell people that these pens are not made to go anywhere except in a nice, soft pocket. And given the fact that the ink is now inexplicably skipping, I'll probably go back to disposable pens. What a shame, and a waste of money."
3,"Worth 2.5 stars, but I'll round up based on past performance","The Mystic Rose continues the downward trend in the quality of stories in ""The Celtic Crusades"" series. While I found The Iron Lance enjoyable, and Black Rood decent, I just could not find as many positive aspects in Mystic Rose.The main character, Cait, is not likeable, nor do you empathize with her in most situations. The reader isn't able to fully connect with her emotions and thoughts. I've never read a Lawhead book in which the main character was a female, but I'm wondering if he struggled with the process of trying to write a story from a woman's perspective. The first half of this story is, quite simply, boring. The remainder does have some redeeming qualities, including vivid battle scenes (a staple of Lawhead's), more interesting characters, and an overall higher level of action.Lawhead is capable of doing so much better than Mystic Rose, and I'm looking forward to a rebound in his next book."
4,This is an impressive book but Kindle version could improve,"This is an impressive book.The mixture of older middle English with newer spellings can be a harder/messierread than either modernized English or the original middle English.But with that aside, the beauty of Spenser's description of natural items isunsurpassed. He enjoys rambling about his subjects ... creating an item that islonger than it could be (his Courtier instincts perhaps ?).These are ways to improve the Kindle version :1. Page numbers please. I've seen other Kindle books with page numbers inserted.When the professor says ... on page x, I'm at a loss (without the paperback) asto where that might be.2. Please link the end notes into where they are referenced. That is the mainreason for e-book purchases - linked content - and was disheartened to not findthat in this book."
4,I've had/enjoyed a written copy for a long long time,"It is a classic truism: until you get it in writing, you have nothing. This work of art is a classic you too can get in writing. And it's quite enjoyable. Beware though! If you read the Faerie Queene in its entirety, you will probably cripple your ability to converse in normal english for quite some time."
3,well...,"I'm of two minds here: on the one hand, you've got to admire Spenser's skillz--after all, we're talkin' thousands of nine-line cantos, eight lines in iambic pentameter and one in iambic hexameter, with a strict AC BD rhyme scheme. That must've taken some doing.On the other hand...I can't say I've really enjoyed reading it particularly. Spenser himself admits that the only reason he even wrote the thing in story form was to appeal to a wider audience; I think he might've done better to stick to straight moral philosophy. The allegory really gets in the way of telling a good story, in my opinion. Plus, and I know I sound like a complete cultural philistine when I say this, the archaic language just annoys the hell out of me.Some people love this poem to death, I know. Not me, however."
5,A Great Book of Mysteries and Legends About NC,"I recently just finished reading this collection of stories about North Carolina. This book is filled with intriguing mysteries and legends about the Tar Heel state. The more famous story of Roanoke Island is covered here, as well as many others most from outside the region have probably never heard about. The stories include tales about shipwrecks, anomalies of nature as well as disappearing people. I found particularly interesting the story entitled 'The Devil's Tramping Ground' itself, as well as 'The Strange Hoof-Marks at Bath' and the mystery of 'The Brown Mountain Lights'. These alone will capture anyone's imagination and spark a desire to explore the hills of North Carolina. All in all a very enjoyable book, and if you like a good collection of short stories this is a good one for you. The fact that they all come from a particular region and are researched North Carolina mystery stories makes it even more facinating and entertaining."
4,Still a good movie,"This is a story of an American pilot during the Korean war. He has brought his his overseas with him and the family trials between spending time and his kids and the men who keep him flying. During all of this, he and his squadron are worried over the Bridges of Toko-Ri, a heavily fortified bridge of huge military target because it is the only bridge that can handle the enemies heavy equipment and tanks. It goes a little slow whith the family stuff but moves fast enough to get through them They end up going on the mission and see what happens. William Holden gives a good performance (as usual) and Grace Kelly as a typical housewife also gives a loving performance. The surprize is a young Mickey Rooney as he gives a brilliant acting performance."
5,Bridges at Toko-Ri,"Excellent movie, but then most that were made in the 40's and 50's are top notch...Any movie with William Holden and Grace Kelly in it has to be terrific. Have seenthis movie at least 10 times and never tire of it."
4,"Large Cuff, Fits HEM-711AC - Recommended","This Large Blood Pressure Cuff fits my Omron HEM-711AC home blood pressure meter (as well as other Omron meters). Here are my observations:Pros -+ Works Well, gives accurate readings+ High QualityCons -- Hard to put on by yourselfThis is a required accessory for those with larger than 13"" circumference arms.Recommended!CFH"
3,Informative video,"This is a good video, very informative. It compares favorably with, for instance, National Geographic and Reader's Digest videos. The computer recreates of the ancient structures are good. When superimposed on the modern grounds, you can see it's artificial because the lighting is wrong. It would be nice if all ancient structures that can be restored and rebuilt are done so.The video could have had normal color footage, instead of that faded black and white footage for the ancient everyday scenes.At the end of the other video about Egypt, it says that there is a lot known, and unknown, about ancient Egypt. It would also apply to ancient Rome (and so on).This Rome one is approximately 60 minutes, and could have been longer. The other two, Egypt and Greece, are approximately 75 minutes each. This Rome one could then have included the Pantheon in Rome, and Stabiae (by Vesuvious).This series of 3 should also be available on DVD."
3,True to its title,"The book is as it claimed to be. It provides ""ideas"" and ""images"" for surfaces not step by step instructions to achieve some of the authors beautiful finishes. I will sum up as a ""go give it a try and see what you get""."
3,Easy to Learn BUT...limited,"This CD is fairly easy to learn and comes with a matching booklet. I found the voice to be a little boring and the booklet did not follow the CD in the same exact order.If you have a good attention span and want to learn basic french, then I would recommend this."
5,the most touching and passionate book on child abuse,"i am already in the human services field and when i read this book for a class project i was doing it only confirmed and reaffirmed as to why i was in this field to begin with. we all have human rights and our children do as well. this book, this child gave us all a precious gift, the love of children. the authors did a magnificent job in giving us all the ability to relive this child's life even though she is gone. god bless mary ellen, the authors and all the children that are living this terrible ordeal today called ""child abuse."" it is up to all of us, the readers to learn and to stop it. the book gave me a new perspective on my work in the human services field and its victims of trauma. i would suggest everyone in the field of social work to definitely read this book and fast. you will never regret it and you'll cry when you are done."
1,Say Wha?!,"Can anyone explain the absurd prices asked? I love Lennie, but not that much. Theone star is just to enter the reviews..."
4,An excellent summary of a remarkable individual.,"For fans of Leonard Bernstein, this is a ""must-have"". This documentary captures the man's once-in-a-century talent and his passion for music.Without a doubt, Bernstein was the most influential American classical musician of the twentieth century. This documentary adequately captures that.The film is really a mix of interviews, film clips, and still photographs. The interviews are thoughtful and sometimes even memorable. The film clips are interesting, such as rare footage of his politically controversial ""Mass"" and ground-breaking ""Candide"" and ""West Side Story"". Unfortunately, still photographs comprise a bit too much of the material, and I found this to be the film's only drawback."
2,too big,For my little girl just learning to use her hands this item is too big. A similar toy about 1/2 the size would be more fun for her.
3,Pendants,Very pretty and all but quite large pendants. If you have a small family it is great but if you are a family of 10 like ours it is too large for one necklace.
4,Logan Sackett,"Logan Sackett, part-time outlaw, fast with a gun,and as tough as raw hide, is drifting along and runs into Emily Talon, an equally tough old widow who is defending her land against a bunch of no-good gunslingers. When Logan finds out Emily was born a Clinch Mountain Sackett, he decides to help and it is down hill from there for the gun-slingers, but not without Logan being shot full of holes and nearly being killed several times. The story is full of interesting characters and colorful language. It will keep your interest."
3,Mediocre,"The reviews of the sciences are decent and helpful. The practice tests are not helpful, however, and are not a good representation of the real MCAT."
2,was expecting more,"This was a disappointment for the beginning, hard to follow if there was a plot,person who jump forward in time, did a poor job of making anyone believe he was from the forties..."
3,"The Philadelphia Experiment is one of my favorites, but it is still not captioned or subtitled for the deaf.","I bought this movie in the VHS version several years ago but I was disappointed that it was not closed-captioned. It was captioned while shown on TV and on HBO several decades ago. I recently rented it from Netflix to see if it had been upgraded and either closed-captioned or English-subtitled. Still not. So there I go again, waiting again. It is one of my favorite movies regardless of how old it is."
2,Disappointed,"It had an interesting story line, but just didn't deliver on film. I felt I was watching a first effort on the acting and filming and special effects."
4,Good Flick,"A good flick. Reminds me of Final Countdown, but in reverse (forward in time, as appose to back in time). Special effects could be a little better, but I guess adequate for the times. If your into time travel, then it is worth the money."
1,The Philadelphia Experiment,"A little disappointing when compared with my memory of first seeing it on its original release, but this is only because the special effects and concept are now somewhat dated. However, it was still good to see Michael Pare oozing wartime sex appeal in a modern day society, one of the attractions of the plot. The warship-trapped-in-time concept was less thrilling than the original, but has stood the test of time for younger viewers without the sophisticated taste of higher tech expectations. A good watch for say a 10 year old but not that intriguing for adults. Worth a look though, for old times sake, after giving it to your nephew for christmas."
3,Final Countdown Gone Bad,"First of all, I enjoyed the movie. It was entertaining and a good Sci-Fi story. What made it bad was Nancy Allen. When I see her on the screen I get an old ""B"" movie feeling about her acting. Michael Paré is okay as an actor but can be dull, he always has that bad boy edge to him, which I enjoy watching. He makes the movie bearable.I loved Final Countdown and thought this was a remake or possibly an old script someone found and decided to try it again. What made this one different and more interesting was the military (bad guys) twist with the developement of yet another weapon and the results of that endeavor. A comment on the early nuclear bomb tests that went on and left many military men dead or poisened. Much of it hidden yet in secret documents. In Final Countdown, the results of unethical teasting were very interesting.If you are looking for a fun time with a bowl of popcorn on a Saturday Night. This could work. Cheers...."
3,Oral history,"The information is there but I would have prefered a narrator with a more native, ethnic storytelling flare."
3,Context is everything,"IT IS ESSENTIAL TO REMEMBER THAT ALL THE COMMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO GERONIMO'S ""DIPLOMACY"" AND LACK OF ANIMUS TOWARDS WHITE PEOPLE EXPRESSED IN THE BOOK AND BY REVIEWERS HAD MORE TO DO WITH THE WORDS A MAN WHO EXPECTED TO BE ASSASINATED AT ANY MOMENT BY HIS CAPTORS. AS SUCH, HIS ANTIPATHY FOR THE WHITE MAN IS ATTENUATED BY A MAN LOOKING DEATH IN THE FACE FROM A CULTURAL TRADITION THAT ONE'S LAST MOMENTS SHOULD BE FREE OF HOSTITLITY."
1,No introduction needed,"This version of Geronimo's autobiography includes a 33 page introduction by Frederick Turner. The introduction nothing more than an insight into Mr. Turner's personal prejudices. I can only assume that someone with such strong biases will be unable to prevent them from affecting his editing. My interest was in reading Geronimo's words and not after they have been filtered by someone with an obvious agenda. I am a student of History and not, of the history of political correctness. I will now have to read the original text without Mr. Turner's censorship."
2,Geronimo's story of his life,I figured that this book would go into greater detail about the famous Apache Indian Geronimo. Since it did not that is why I gave it a two star rating.
5,very beautiful design,"The color and sleek design blends well with my Silestone countertops and island in the kitchen, size is perfect for crushing/mixing my spices together"
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book because I loved the T.Jefferson Parker books that I read before. I'm glad I know how good his books can be so I won't be put off by this one but I might have been if this were the first one I had read. I gave 2 stars for the large portions of the book that droned on and on about 'life and stuff'. I would give 3.5 stars for the rest of the book that had some police procedural/politics in it and the 'scary' parts.Buy a different book by Parker and you'll probably find something you'll want to re-read. Like one of my favorites ""California Girl""."
4,Good Police novel,"This novel contains all that you would expect from a police novel. A few twist and turns that keeps you guessing, a good bit of excitement and disappointment. All in all a good Novel."
4,A very pleasant read,"I'm looking forward to reading books 3 and 4 after reading 1 and 2. Anything that gets young people interested in reading on their own is a good thing. I read my brother's Amazing Stories in the late 50's: I had flunked 3rd grade and was just beginning to learn to read on my own. The texts at school were boring and ordinary, but science fiction was exciting and different. Good children's books from "" The Wizard of OZ"" to the Harry Potter books have been those where the young reader is carried away into the strange and magical world of the imagination! I hope someone better than Disney makes the first movie of these books!"
5,Potter lives up to Hot reviews,"Thank you, Amazon.com for sending my family Harry Potter. For the very first time in his life, my 12 year old couldn't put down a book.It wasn't wrestling that kept him up late last night, but little Harry Potter. He fell asleep reading in the wee hours, and only his light still on alerted me to this new miracle. This morning his first question was ""Do I have time to read about Harry before leaving for school?"" What a book!"
5,Da Bomb!,This was no doubt the best book I have ever read! There is so much mystery you never know what is going to happen next! The only thing I don't like is that they say it's only for 9-12. I would say 9-adult. I'm 13 and I loved it. My mom even wants to read it! I can't wait until the 4th comes out! If you haven't read this book then your missing a lot! From beginning to end non-stop FUN!
5,"Stereotypical magic, superb plotting","I was originally disinterested in reading Harry Potter - after all, everyone and their mother was doing it, and I perversely refused. I also prefer my magic to be ""higher"" - think The Dark is Rising by Susan Cooper. However, I finally broke down and read this book and its sequel, and I am glad that I did. J. K. Rowling's imagery is bright and well-visualized, and her character development is excellent. Second to none, though, is her ability to define the plot and keep it moving at a pleasant, snappy pace. This is a refreshing change from many stories, which either get bogged down in the details or move the action along too quickly. These books are a good read and shouldn't take more than a few days for the experienced reader. They are also excellent read-to-me books, as evidenced by my mother's fourth-grade students, who hung on every word!"
5,what is so great about Harry Potter,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fun reading for everyone of all ages. I think that Harry Potter can be a learning experience for everyone. Even though they say some wierd stuff in this book. I think little kids understand it, because they have very imagative minds. I am not just saying kids have it adults have it too. Harry Potter is a book a family could read together and discuss about it with one another."
5,This book should win the Newbery award....its brilliant!,"I just love this book, she writes so vividly and makes you want to keep reading on and on. I love when they are playing Quidditch! She really is creative and I would love to talk to her. READ THIS BOOK! I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH!!!!! BYE!"
1,Harry Potter a good book,"I really do not like this book. It is full of ...""magical"" things and I really was not interested in the bookor characters at all. This book is definitly not worth all the hype it got. It was hard to follow, hard to understand, and definitly not a good book! END"
1,It sucked,Worst book everThis was the worst book I have ever read in my entire life. I have never read a worst book.
2,Overrated,This book is WAAAY overrated. It's not that great. It's okay....probably less than okay but better than bad.
5,Fantasy Follower,I have always been a lover of a good fantasy novel. I constantly heard people ranting and raving about Harry Potter. I finally decided to give him a try and I fell in love. I couldn't put it down and once I finished the first book I had to run out and get the other three. I'm still counting down until Year 5 comes out.J K Rowling created Harry Potter's world to contain enough imagination to keep me interested with making Harry himself normal enough to seem real. It's the perfect balance.
3,harry potter and the sorecrer's stone,"I dont really like this book because it keeps on changing settings and I cant understand it that well. but this book is preety exciting in a way. I thought that when harry got a mysteries letter from hagerat was to most exciting because I did not no who it came from.it is also exciting because you will not know what will happen next. This book is about a boy named harry he is ten years old.he lives in with his anut. One day he recive a letter from a creature harrgert and then haggeert use his magic to go to a nother world. then he gose to a school with wizards and learns magic. one day he heard about the sorerce's stone and he trid to get it. when he was there, their was a monster so he fought the monster and got the sorecer's stone. later on forgement chased him and crashed in to dombo door[the head master of hogart]then dombon door told hary to break the stone and forgerment disapeered."
3,Should do well,"A modest, undemanding fantasy suitable for children and others in the 8-12 age range, this should do well. Readers who are unaccountably put off by derivative plot, wooden narrative and tin-eared dialog may prefer the mature oeuvre of Enid Blyton. Other authorities recommend the 'Narnia' cycle of C.S. Lewis and the 'Once and Future King' of T.H. White as some measure of preparation for Tolkien (or, for those who can cope with the wordplay and literary allusions, Terry Pratchett). But none of these authors - not even Pratchett, who is still alive - is so pretty."
2,Harry potters first year at Hogwarts,"This story takes place in a place in a place where wizards, witches, ghost, goblins, and giants exist at a school named Hogwarts. This place is important because this is the school Harry Potter will learn his ways in using magic. He will also about his past in this place.This book is mostly about Harry Potter as one of the main characters of the story showing him about his past and how he learns and the games he plays at Hogwarts. Two other characters are Harry's friends which help him get through the year, as well as Harry helping them get through the year.In my opinoin I think Harry Potter must of been real famous because everyone knew of him. The book is interesting because of the way they learn magic and how sometimes messed up. I gave the book 2.5 stars because sometimes it got intresting and sometimes boring. I would recommend this story because it is funny and interesting."
5,Great adventure,The story contains the elements of a good role playing game.I enjoy the descriptions of magical effects and when it fizzles too.
4,Harry Potter the sorceres stone,"I like this book because it is fun and exciting. You can read this book no matter how old you are. It relates to magic, and that's another reason why I like it. You will want to read it over and over again because the story just gets you going."
5,older reader,"I'm a parent of a 12 and 4 year old. I saw the movie listing and wanted to read the book first after years of hype about ""Harry Potter"", so I bought a paperback for my oldest daughter. I started the book in the morning and finished it that night. To put it simply it was like going back into childhood and just reading a good fairy tale. That's it. You shouldn't put more into it than that. Just a well written (although I had to keep the odd sounding names straight)fairy tale that opens your imagination like it should."
5,COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN,"I will admit first off that I am 14 years old and I STILL loved this book. It is my new favorite book, when just yesterday, Angela's Ashes was. My family and I got home last night at 1 am, and I did not go to sleep until 5:15, when I was done. This book is a must read for everyone, and unless you are extremley religious, you won't find it ""evil"" or whatever."
5,luv it,"this has gotten me in love with the series! i won't stop reading them. i have now finish the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, book. i am no reading th fifth book: Harry Potter and the order of the phoenix. my parents won't stop saying that i should stop reading every single time i some free time!! =)"
3,"Admiration for Rowling Led Me to ""Sorcerer's Stone""","Excellent read for the target demographic. The storyline is easy to follow and descriptive, enabling the reader to colorfully visualize characters and scenes. I would not recommend this book to anyone over the age of 15 due to the lack of character development, depth and interesting dialogue. Sorcerer's Stone is the first and last book of the series I'll read. Not enough ""juice"" to keep me interested."
5,Execllent book for Middle Schoolers,I liked this book because it is great and exciting book.My favorite part is when he gets to go to the school of Wisardry.Another part is when he gets to play Quiddich games and how he has the best broom stick.
5,It really is as great as the hype!,"I'm an adult and I usually read mystery/thrillers. However, these books have become so ingrained in our culture, that I wanted to know what they were all about. I thought about just watching the movies, but I always prefer to read first so I can form my own impressions, before the movie forms them for me.I won't say much - a lot has already been said about these books. I will just say that J.K.Rowling is a true artist with words, who creates a magical world that you wish you could visit. We all owe her a debt of gratitude for getting young folks interested in reading entire books in this age of twitter, blogs, youtube and sound bites.The other thing I will say is that these books are for kids of all ages, and I'm very glad I read this one. I will definitely read the other six, and then watch the movies. Such enchantment!"
4,always a classic,"No matter how old I get, or how many times I read it.... this series will always be entertaining a put a smile on my face."
5,Fast and Fun,"It is a measure of this book's quality that, although I am an adult and therefore not the target audience, I still found this an entertaining read. There is an appeal here that transcends age; the major difference for an adult reader is that he or she will go through the book more quickly. In terms of plot and character, however, this book beats some of the recent ""adult"" books I have read."
3,Maybe I'm too mundane...,"I admit I don't understand Potter-mania. The books are okay -- while not my first choice of reading material, they'll while away a slow afternoon -- but they don't begin to inspire the passionate devotion in me that I see in so many reviews posted here. I don't find even find them particularly impressive in their imagination. Maybe it really is me..."
5,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"Even though this book has been hailed as a wonderful book for children, I enjoyed it thoroughly. I wanted to read it before I let my children dive into it, and I found myself being completely delighted by the story! It is definitely a must-read for youngsters, and for the young at heart. It is delightful, whimsical, and a joy to read. I highly recommend it for those with vivid imaginations!"
5,Can't Wait,Good book. Can't wait to read the next few. It was a good book. Wonderful book it was. Lol and rofl.
5,THE BEST,"When I was ten I became a Harry Potter fan. Wherever I was you would see me with one of those Harry Potter books under my arm. My favorite part of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is ""Quidditch."" Man, if i had a *nimbus 2000 broomstick, I would like to play that! These are great books, which I recommend to anyone who can read."
3,"Nothing Spectacular to Merit the Hype About this ""Anniversary Edition""","Belatedly I found out that this is not worth buying. Yes, I bought the book because I thought that being touted as the 10th Anniversary Edition, it would be SPECIAL. Like there would be at least a Reflection page by Scholastic or JKR since the book (and the obscure author) has been a huge success. However, the contents are basically the same. The only additional is the sketch of Snape by JKR with a small note regarding the sketch plus the colored frontis of Hagrid on the boat...yes, the dust jacket has a new art and the boards are red with golden stars...but that's about it.If you collect the books though, as in because you want every copy of the HP book series, then what I just said won't matter. But if you're buying it because you think it offers something new, then I would say it is not worth it."
5,Why not like it?,"This book was well written and captures the minds of not only children, but adults. I couldn't out the book down, and the descriptions, oh the descriptions!From Charles Dickens and now it's J.K. Rowling. The book played in mind and I could visualize the characters and their actions. I have only read a few really good books and this is one of them. Only a select few books have really caught my mind, and when someone asks me a good book, Harry Potter always comes to mind. I can't think of another book that comes so close to playing all the scenes and images in my head, and she has such an easy style of writing. It's not to hard to understand,a nd for all those adults out there, if you get past the first few chapters, the books turns out to be a smash. I would recomend this book for any age, old and younge. I really hope that you do give it a chance and try it."
5,Very nice book,"My sister gave the paperback to my son a couple years ago. He really enjoyed it, and has read the next two so far. He hasn't started on the huge 4th volume yet. I recently read this one, and thought it was a very good book. Suspense, humor, adventure, magic... what more could you want? Especially if you're a kid. This collector's edition is very nice, and the Amazon price was great. The drawing by JK Rowling is pretty good. i wonder why she didn't do her own illustrations all along. from what I had read, I thought maybe it would be an actual pen and ink drawing, but it appears to be a reproduction. However, there is an autograph on the same page that certainly looks like it was actually written there with an ink pen. I've yet to find a website that clearly describes what you are getting. Anyway, it's a nice collector's item, and you can't beat the price."
2,"I'm sorry, but I didn't like it.","I tried to like this book, I really did. I thought to myself ""Billions of people can't be wrong."". But well, as it comes to me, I didn't like it. The plot is boring, and the first 100 pages are so boring that I can't really understand how someone can get through them. I personaly believe that a big part of its sucsses, at least from what I saw in Israel, is publicity and commercials. Half a year before it arrived to Israel there were commercials to it anywhere. If you bought a book, it said on the bag: ""Have you read Harry Potter yet?"", and there were signs about it anywhere. I even saw an interview with a critisizer that praised the book, and then mistakebly admitted that she didn't read it.I can't really understand what is all the excitment around this book. It is, in my opinion, after I forced myself to end it, an average book, if not worse."
2,Almost good,"A word of warning should be given by those who recommend this book to grown-ups. It's a book for children and should be read a such. The book is written in a clear and simple style using numerous cliches of fantasy. Ideal for kids, but too obvious for my taste. I gave it to stars instead of three as it kept me hoping that the fun would start on the next page, which never happened."
5,This book will take you to another world!,"I like this book because it's a different kind of book and fun to read,and makes you want to know more . It also gives you a different perspective of a different world of magic , mystery, and entertainment.I also thank Mrs.Holt for reading it to us in class last year.I also wish they would make a a movie for this book,that would be a cool movie.I hope you like this bookas much as I did .It's a really awesome but different,book.Please read and find out for yourself, you may like it."
4,This is a good book,"The book Harry Potter and the Sorcers Stone was written by J.K Rowling. A boy named Harry was placed on his aunt's and uncle's door step. His aunt and uncle wanted nothing to do with him, so they made him sleep in a cupboard under the stairs.When a letter appeared on his front steps, his uncle wouldn't let him read it. His uncle got scared and let him sleep in the house. The next day another letter came. His uncle got even madder and went on a family trip. The first night they stayed in a hotel, but another letter came. Harry's uncle went to rent a boat and floated accross the lake to a cabin and spent the night. As they were going to sleep, a giant named Hagrid took Harry to buy his wizard supplys. Then Harry was back with his aunt and uncle and began school where he has many more adventures. But I will not tell you any more, you have to read Harry Potter and the Sorcers Stone. I recommend this book to all of you."
2,The next three books are much better,I am a big Harry Potter fan but I almost gave up on the whole series while reading this book. I found it to be very boring and slow moving. I have talked to many other people who are into the series as well and they agree that this book is not that great. It was these same people that a year after reading this book got me to pick up the second one and realize how good this series really gets. This book is good for explanation and history but not great entertainment. I do agree that this is a great series just not this particular book.
5,Harry Potter is not only for kids!,"To all the readers out there.... I know that the Harry Potter's books have been categorized as ""books for children"". It has been a while since my husband and I (33 and 31), have had so much fun reading a book. We would like to recommend all adults to read these books and pass them on! you'll have lots of fun!"
2,Harry Potter review,My friend Morgan would really like this book it is five star rating MY friend Meredith would like this book just as much as Morgan would I think
3,Got me hooked on fantasy,"This book, I have to admit, is one of my favorites. However, there are many other better books out there for adolecents and kids, too. If you enjoyed this book, there are many other books that are much better.If you are above the age of ten and don't mind a little bloodshed, I reccommend Garth Nix, Tamora Pierce, T.A. Barron, and Diana Wynne Jones."
5,Really Intriguing,A very great book! I can't wait to read the whole series! The movies do not do the books any justice.
5,Do you believe in magic?,"This disarming little book sweeps you up and hurtles you along with its hero Harry, a small boy with a tragic past. Fresh and imaginative, the story evokes sympathy and admiration for Harry and his gutsy approach to his problems, some of them life threatening. An enchanting read for all ages."
5,This is the best book I have ever read!!!,"If you are thinking of reading this book start right now because this is the best book ever wirten! Their is so much fantsy, magic and comedy you feel as though you are right there next to Harry watching it all happen!"
4,Read Patricia c. Wrede!!!,"This is a great book, fantastic! And I can see why it is everyone's favorite. I have read Harry potter And The Sorcerers Stone twice already, and can't wait for the next book. But nothing can compare with Patricia C. Wrede's books. so, when you finish harry potter, read one of Patricia's books!!!"
5,WOW!,"These 3 books were GREAT! If you liked them, you will also like: -any of the Oz books (1-40) -Edward Eager books -E. Nesbit books -Patricia Wrede books"
4,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"What a wonderful diversion! I was looking for a new book by one of my 'regular' authors (Koontz, King, Stackpole, etc.) when I saw this book and remembered some internet talk about the series. I broke down and bought it, expecting a very 'basic' read.What a suprise! The visual imagery is wonderful and our protaganist is a very identifiable character.If a parent is looking for a book to interest their young child in the joy of reading, I would direct you to this book.(Am I the only one that thinks there's more to Hagrid than's being let on?)Oh by the way. . .I'm 'over 40' and a banker.Read this book/Read this book to your child!"
3,"good, but not amazing","The first Harry Potter is a good book, imaginative and creative. I can see why kids who normally don't like to read enjoy this. However, I'm surprised to hear advanced readers, especially teens and adults, raving about this. I would think they'd enjoy something with more insight and emotional core."
4,Big Hype and Pictures Draw a Crowd,"My nine-year old wanted to get a copy of Harry Potter because it was all the rage. I bought the book for him, which was supposed to be written for his grade level. I found he had a terrible time with the names. We ended up buying the cassette, and reading the book a long with the audio tape. This made it much more pleasant to read, but it is not the most economical way to enjoy the story. Next time we may just go for the tape."
5,This Book Is Enchanting,"Harry Potter and The Sorcerers Stone is the best book I have ever read! Harry is a young boy who's parents died when he was little, he was sent to live with his mean aunt, uncle, and spoiled cousin Dudley. Harry recived an invitation to Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Durring his first year at Hogwarts Harry makes new friends, and rivals. Harry along with his friends finds himself in some trouble along with his friends. I thought this book was GREAT! It is full of excitement and enchantment, it is sure to spark anyone's imagination weather you are 10 or 97!"
5,an asome book full of magic and exitement.,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#65533;s Stone is a great book about a young boy named Harry Potter. He has to live with his aunt and uncle who know that young Harry Potter is a wizard because his parents Lilly (a witch) and James (a wizard) Potter are both killed by Lord Voltimort. Lord Voltimort is called you-know-who in the wizarding world, for he must not be named. When Harry Potter goes to Hogwarts School of Witch Craft and Wizardry he gets into all sorts of trouble. He meets some new friends named Ron and Hermine. When Harry receives the fastest broom yet, a Nimbous Two Thousand, he is surprised who sent it. He also meets the evil Lord Voltimort. He is very surprised when Lord Voltimort is inside a teacher&#65533;s body, but you have to read to find out witch teacher&#65533;s body he is in."
5,This is how I like the book.,"A couple of mounths ago my cousin came to my home to spend the week. She showed me the book and I dicovered that it was unique and astonashing. Like Voldermort,and how they were afraid to to say his name,or the invisible steps that you had to remember to jump the fallen ones. And how the secret passeges lead somewere else on Fridays,I also liked the different words they had for things. Thanks for the book cousin."
5,Harry Potter And The Scorcerer's Stone,I thought is was a well written book. I don't see how anyone can say this is a bad book. It was full of adventure and fun. There was never a dull moment. Every child should be have the chance to read it.
4,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,Do ya like magic and potions? If you do you'll like the book Harry Potter #1.Harry Potter #1 starts when an old man named Hagrid drops off Harry to his aunt's ... the Dursley's. This book takes place at Hogwarts School. The moral of the story is Harry and his friends go on a journey to find the Sorcerer's Stone. The book is an adventure and fiction.I chose this book because it is funn and detailed. I would give this book four to five stars.
4,weeee,"This book is so cute. I thought it was gonna be alittle out of my league... Boy was I wrong. This is a very interesting fairy tale. Not only does it keep my attention the whole time, its amusing as well. I'm so glad I can say that I've read Harry Potter. It seems to be the hot new thing now that the movie has came out. After reading the first one I can't wait to dive into the next ones!"
4,At a loss,"As a children's librarian, I am delighted to see kids going nuts about reading, especially a long book like this. To be sure, it is well done and entertaining. Yet I still feel at a loss to explain why this book in particular has become such a mania, especially among adults, when there are many other equally good books out there. Surely the fad aspect has something to do with it, though as I say it is nice to have a fad with something basically good at its heart. I just hope kids will be moved by this to find the myriad other magical books out there for their own discovery, and not to be pied pipered simply because everyone seems to be doing it in a kind of Oprahlike frenzy."
1,Good book. But Stephen Fry's reading is 1000x better!,"The HP books are a great deal of fun, and it's hard to imagine anything else I could say about them that hasn't been said ten thousand times already.I do however want to say something about the *Audiobooks.* For reasons beyond my ken, Amazon.com does not let you know that there is an infinitely better version than this available, read by the delightful Stephen Fry. According to J.K. Rowling, her daughter listens to the (Fry) audiobooks constantly. Stephen Fry's gorgeous voice is a pleasure any time, but these books give him grand scope for mimicry and vocal characterization.Choosing to record a new version of these books for an American audience when Stephen Fry has already so brilliantly done them is perverse in its idiocy. Don't bother with this version; go over to Amazon.co.uk and buy the real thing!"
4,"Enjoyable, But Not Fascinating","It's not bad. Amusing, fast-paced and easy to read. Also extremely well-plotted; all independent events converge on the Sorcerer's Stone. That's very skillful. It is quite enjoyable, but not fascinating for me.I don't think it is so good as a fantasy novel. It is not so imaginative, rather too realistic as a fantasy. It doesn't describe an another world, but a mere variation of our real ordinary world. It's rather a traditional school-life story. However, I think that makes this novel readily acceptable to so many people, even to those who doesn't like fantasy novels very much.The characters are rather two-dimensional. Harry, Ron and Hermione are relatively well described, still I feel they are not flesh-and-blood people but chessmen of different roles. And I don't like the description of the school houses rivalry; the house points are up and down like a computer game. I might be fascinated, if this novel were more like a novel."
4,I must be getting old,Only reason for a 4 instead of 5 was the reading level. Wish I would have read it when I was younger.
5,Best Book Ever (Fantasy Wise),"i read many books and many different kinds of books. out of all of the fantasy books i have read , this is my favorite next to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire."
5,Fantastic,"I have seen all the movies, but the books really are so much better! Much more detail than what was in the movie."
2,"Wonderful children's book, but......","I enjoyed reading this book, but I fail to see how it can quite reach #4 (or thereabouts) in the Millennium pole. JK Rowling's writing reminds me of Enid Blyton's (a favourite of mine when I was a child). Older readers should look elsewhere for more meaty reading satisfaction (any of the SF classics should do the trick).Having said that, am happy that children are turning to books because of Mr. Potter!"
5,Al jay veenstra book of Harry Potter and the soccer Stone,The story i read is a.Vary interesting book because it is about. A boy that finds out that he is a famous wizerd.I rekamend it if you like mystery book.The resion i reckamend it is that is vary good book.
4,Amazing,It is a great book although it spends a little too long on describing everything but fortunately not too much.
2,Probably shouldn't have waited,"I'm probably the last person on earth to read the Harry Potter books or watch the movies (or maybe it just seems liked it). Since my kids were excited about the seventh one coming I decided to give it a try. I would have stopped with the first one if these books weren't so hyped. To tell the truth, I'm three books in to the set and struggling.What a disappointment from what I was expecting do to all the raves. I'm thinking I probably shouldn't have waited so long to start these, and also wondering how such poorly written work can be proclaimed as great literature? Give me Roald Dahl or C. S. Lewis anyday and I'll read happily for hours. The same is not true for Harry Potter."
5,This is a great story about fantasy and adventure!,I think this is a great book! I am 8 years old and my mom bought this book for me to read. I have been reading chapter books since I was 6 years old. This is far the best I have ever read! I can't wait until she buys me the rest of the Harry Potter series.
5,stop being a muggle and read this book.,"This series is the best, I can't wait for the 4th book. enough said."
5,This is my favorite book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is the best book!!!!! You have to buy it. It is about a boy named Harry Potter who is a wizard! He is the most famous wizard! He learns loads of magic.He lives in a house named Griffindoor. To hear the rest get the book!!!! I give this book an A+.
2,Over-rated for adults,"I picked-up this book because of the hype, and after reading numerous reviews, which indicated that this books was not just for kids. I expected it to have the same appeal to adults as C. S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia. It does not. There is nothing about this book which could lend itself to a multi-level reading as Narnia does. It is just a kid's adventure story in the 'land' of wizards and witches. And even in that, I don't think it lives up to the hype."
5,This amazing author comes up with an amazing book!,I loved reading this book. This reminded me of a book called James and the Giant Peach. With a wonderful cast of characters. The wonderful main character Harry is a great hero. I loved every single minute of this book. I highly recemend it.
5,the world's greatest book!,"Harry potter and the socer's stone begins when Harry's parents who are wizzards are killed by an evil wizzard. Harry then goes to live with his Aunt petunia and Uncle Vernon. Then Harry gets letters adressed for him but his Uncle tears them to bits. Finally Harry finds out he is a wizzard and has been excepted at, Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizadry. Going to Hog worts does nothing but lead to adventure. I thought this book was great. I thought it was great becuase it was so suspencful. the book also had end to end adventure and fun."
5,casted a spell over me,"being an adult i hesitated at the thought of owning a harry potter book especially since it was a hit with critics....usually the critics choose boring books...finally i bought it and i am so glad i did.everyone always dreams about fantastic adventures and magic powers that will transport them out of there ordinary lives and place them in a world where anything is possible.it also shows you that even a so called ""nothing"" can end up great and so why judge a book by the cover...no pun intended..it was magical and whimsical and an over all good book and it was written by a female and it is not a romance...read this book young or old it can take you on the adventure people still dream about but never mention...."
5,Magicial! The perfect book !,"I'm 10 years old. A book can't get any better than this. These are the best books I've ever read! J.K. Rowling is best! I read all 3 books in 11 days! I even read more than 100 pages in one day! Really, I did. This is a mystery/comedy book. Recommended for all ages. You won't want your money back. You cherish this book forever! Guaranteed!"
5,I loved this book,"I don't know what to say that you probably haven't heardbefore, but I'll just tell you like it is. I this this is one of thebest books for kids and adults. It will become a classic within years. I read it and couldn't put it down! It is so different and funny you want to see what weird things will happen next. It is about a boy who doesn't know he is a wizard, but is one, and is sent to a school for wizards and has so many fun, dangerous, and suspensful andventures. You will want to read it over and over again, I promise. It is a great book for all ages!"
2,Vastly overrated for adults....for young only,"I was recommended this book by the myriads of devoted fans. I approached this book from the standpoint that it is essentially written for younger folk. I am 34, but so many adults swore that this was a great work of fantasy that I decided to give it a try. I have a rule. If, after the first 100 pages, Im not interested enough to go on, I just stop right then and there. This book sadly falls into that category. I am very surprised that so many adults feel that this is a major work of fantasy. It pales in comparison to most writers. The writing is not all that good. The story is comical to an extent and has moments of imagination, but not nearly enough to recommend. From the youth standpoint, I can somewhat see that an interesting and comical story is developing and I am always for youth reading more and more books. It will lead to reading better and more thought provoking books eventually. For adults, however, this book has nothing to offer."
5,"Harry Potter, a wizard, meets many problems and many friends",Harry goes through main gates and a weird train gates while meeting Herimone and Ron. Teacher gives him trouble too. Quiddish matches make him better known than the scar on his head. Harry and the students make words about his trouble with you-know-who and that is what makes it so suspenseful. The best age to read this book is 8-11 in my opinion. Also I would give it 5 stars because I adore it. You will have to read this book to find out what happens with Harry and you-know-who!
3,Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone,"The book I chose to review is The Sorcerer's Stone from the Harry Potter series. In my opinion this book Should not be banned because of its content. I do not believe the witchcraft in this novel is intended to be real; it is simply a story and a way of entertaining the reader. Because of this, it should not be banned. There are far worse television shows,music videos, movies, and other forms of entertainment that cause people harm. Books should not be censored if these other things are not. Some people enjoy reading about fantasy and that is what Harry Potter books provide. In conclusion, a person's right to choose what they read should not be taken away."
5,Amazing book,"This book was absolutely terrific. It was filled with suprises and suspense, and you can't believe the ending. I reccomend it to everyone who loves fantsdy, or even doesn't!"
5,Harry Poter: A book for all ages,"I am a teen and I had seen allot of people reading this bookand I thought it was for kids. I didn't want to read it because Ithought it wasn't up to my ""level"" of reading, boy was IWRONG! My gifted teacher told us to read this book and figure out why it had been on the New York Times Best Sellers list for so long. I can totally see why now, it is charming, mystical, and takes you to a place that you dream about going to. The never ending adventures of Harry Potter are a joy for everyone to read, I recomend it to any skeptical readers that think this book is not on their ""level,"" because they will be in for a big shock when they see how awsome this book is!"
5,The Greatest Book Ever,"This is a brilliant book, j.k. Rowling has a gift of writting books you don't want to put down. The best part was when Harry went with Hagrid to Diagon Alley. The follow up(Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets) is also great, there will be seven(one for each year of his school life).Roll on number three."
5,A review from Mr. Entertainment Lover,"ASTONISHING! WRITING AT IT'S BEST! Harry Potter is an excellent fantasy book that everyone will love. Harry Potter is the son of a great wizard and witch. When they get killed by the evil wizard Voldemort, he is adopted by his nasty and aunt and uncle. Later Harry escapes into a world of magic and finds out he is destined to become a great sorcerror. He then joins a school for wizards and witches and escapes into a magic world filled with unicorns, ghosts, dragons, and plenty of other adventures."
4,the boy,"The book Harry Potter is the best story I have ever read.The story is creative and it is full of adventure. It is about this normal boy in a normal day, until something changed his life. I think that everyone in any age should read this book because it is full of mystery, adventure, and fantasy.M.B"
4,good company,it's a very good book and the company made a mistake while sending it but they were very nice to me and repare their mistake.
5,Great read!,Really enjoyed this book and can't wait to read the next in the series. Have been wanting to read these for awhile.
5,Just Amazing,"The only reason I got this book in the first place, was because it came in a set with other books that I wanted in a book order at school. I simply put it in the back of my bookshelf when I got it in the mail and didn't look at it for several months. Then, on a snow day while school was closed I had nothing to do. I looked through my room and found Harry Potter. I read the first few chapters and became HOOKED! Just as I finished the first one I went out and bought the second. Two years later, I had read the third and second books at least two times. Sonething about leaving your troubles behind by going on a train far away and meeting new friends was a universal dream that most people have wished for. I've now seen the movie and waiting for the fifth novel of the series!"
4,"""Harry Potter"" is accessible magic!","This book is a fabulous read for any age, with some quite profound stuff underneath the enchanting adventure of the magical protagonist. Highly recommended!"
5,Awesome,I've seen the movies read the series who knows how many times but reading the first book is always a adventure
5,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's stone,"Harry Potter is a kid who you just can't help liking. No matter who you are, you'll love this book. I used to hate Harry Potter six months ago but once my sister made me read it, I'm Harry Potter's biggest fan."
5,Not just a kids book!,"What can I add to the more than 3000 reviews that have already been written. I'm a male in my mid 30's and I bought this book to read to my sons. Instead we ended up getting the book on tape and listened to it while we where travelling, however I was so into the story I picked the book up and read it in an afternoon. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and highly recommend it for adults as well as teens."
5,A wonderful fantasy about how one boy makes a big difference,"Harry Potter is famous before he can walk or talk so the people of 'his world' think he should live with a muggle (non - magical) family intill he is of a certian age. He has never played Quidditch flying high above the trees, he has never done spells or potions, he has never even seen pictures that move, common things for a boy of his age to have experienced in 'his world'. Instead he lives with his Aunt Petuinia, Uncle Vernon, and big stupid cousin Dudley who make him wear old misfitting clothes, never have birthdays, live in a cupboard, and allow him to beat up and pushed around. All this and more changes when a letter arrives for him and a giant man kocks on the door. You will love Harry and all his magical friends."
5,Harry Potter and the PHILOSOPHERS STONE,"Why are you americans so reluctant to use PHILOSOPHER, its the WORD, its the right word, JK is a brit gal, and she used the word, so WHY CANT YOU what is your problem? TOO DIFFICULT FOR YOU IS IT? HMMMM dont you HAVE DICTIONARIES??????? Anyway, this book RULES as do all the hp books, what more can i say, other than woo, and hoo. Cant wait for the order of the phoenix, it better be at least twice as thick as goblet of fire, all the more hp reading pleasure! cant wait for the film (with all the top British actors and actresses...ahem, you yanks probably cudnt understand all the LONG WORDS IN THE SCRIPT) goodbye."
5,"Fun, Fresh and Exciting to read to your child!","My seven year old daughter and I are thoroughly enjoying this book. I have read the book through because I couldn't wait to see what happens myself. It is a fun, heartwarming book that is so imaginative I smile when I think of it. We can't wait to read the sequels. What a pleasant way to put my daughter to bed each night. Thank you Ms. Rowling! Imagination and Creativity and Excitement begin to describe this great book. I'd say the age levels should be 7 on up!"
4,A Must Read Book,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It's about a boy named Harry Potter who is off to a wizard school for his first year. This is a must read book. My favorite part was when he had to play chess to go into the next room and solve that riddle. The ending was wonderful, but I wish it had more details. You'll have to read the book for yourself to see if YOU like the ending!"
5,Imaginative and gripping,"In all honesty, like most over-hyped things I was a skeptic about the Harry Potter novels. After a friend of mine read the first installment and loved it, I decided to read it for myself - and I am glad I did. The character's are brilliantly written and it's so action packed that you don't want to put it down. I am now well on my way to the second book. Great fun!"
5,Great read aloud for parents and teachers alike!,"I am reading Harry Potter to my class of 3rd graders and they love it! It is exciting, funny, and fast paced. I think I laugh as much as the kids do!"
5,Harry Potter Rules!,"This book, the first in the series, is great for people youngand old. It is about a boy named Harry whose parents were killed in a""car crash"" and he was left on his evil aunt and uncle's doorstep by a monster on a flying motorcycle later identified as Hagrid. Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and Dudley are not nice to him because, since they knew his past, they didn't want to mess with him. His bedroom was a closet. Then the letters started coming.Uncle Vernon tried to get rid of them, but they keep multiplying, so they move to an island and Hagrid rows to them and tells Harry what is in the letter. He is destined to go to Hogwarts, the wizarding school. He goes many strange places, meets many strange people, learns about a new sport, and conquers the wizard that really killed his parents. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is worth missing your favorite TV shows to sit down and read. J. K. Rowling is a great author and remember, a book lasts longer than a Surviver."
5,A Winner!,"LOVED IT! I put off reading this book because it was touted as a kid's book. Maybe so, but I was only two pages in to the book when I knew it would be a winner. The story is so imaginative and well written that it can touch that special place in each of us that retains some child-like wonderment. I read this book, then immediately ordered the next two in the series. Book four will be out soon and I can barely wait! The story flows smoothly, is well written and is occasionally laugh out loud funny. It's an easy, fast-paced read with interesting places and characters. Come on! The sorting hat awaits us, and classes will soon begin again! Escape from your Muggle life for a bit; after all, don't you crave a bit of magic?"
5,You won't be able to put it down! Great for kids or adults.,"I bought the first four harry potter books about a year ago and did not have the time to read them until last week. I was wondering why the series was such a big hit and I found out. The books put you in a made up world you do not want to stop reading about.When I did pick up the first book to read I could not put it down. There are not too many characters which would confuse children (and adults who try to read real fast like I do), there are interesting twists in the story, and JK Rowlings Harry Potter world is just a nice escape from reality. A very enjoyable read."
5,Wonderful!,Even better the second time...or third..or fourth. It pulls you in nd keeps you turning each page. Never wanting to put it down.
5,Harry Potter is cool,"Sarah and Me think this book was full of excitement and adventure. The amazing world that Joanne Rowling creates traps the imagination with its sorcery. It's all about this normal boy who finds he is a wizard. He meets friends and enemies in his school,Hogwarts, for witchcraft and wizardry. But one enemy stands above the croud. His name, his name is VOLDEMORT!"
1,Spazzer's Comments,"There have been many great books written in our time---but Harry Potter is certainly not one of them.For one, Rowling has made the characters superficial and cheap, and there is no character development. Harry is always the same, Voldemort is always gonna be evil, you get the point.Good is not a pure good, and evil is usually a fallen good. Rowling doesn't make any blend in that; good is good, and bad is definitely bad. No one changes.Plus, the whole thing about his scar at birth is ridiculous. Harry doesn't deserve that; he didn't do anything. The plot is overused. Voldemort keeps on showing up every book...when is there going to be a new plot? I appreciate her creativity, but there are authors that can write much better than this.*ANIME ROCKS!*"
3,Not up to the hype,"I have to agree with a previous poster, while the book was good it certainly is not up to the hype that has accompanied it. There is nothing in this book that Piers Anthony did not do 25 years ago and did better. The characters are pretty standard for a fantasy book, the evil sorcerer, the young hero etc. but there is nothing particularly compelling about them. The fantasy elements are also pretty standard fare, the plot tends to be a series of almost unconnected episodes. For a better treatment check out Piers Anthony's Xanth series."
1,"Dull, derivative, unimaginative","Well, you can't please everyone. I decided to try this book because of its phenomenal success and popularity. I can now say that I have read it and I found it a dull affair. Rowling is not a good writer. The book is episodic and the narrative doesn't really move along. While everyone else praises the book for its display of imagination, I didn't find one novel idea or incident in it. The wit was weak, the characters one dimensional, the plot uninteresting. Rowling has taken fictional bits and pieces from dozens of other children's books and whipped up a stew out of them which lacks originality and force. More grievously, there is an emptiness behind it all. A book for very, very easily entertained (and not very literate) children."
5,good read,all of the harry potter books are amazing the books are read by kids of all ages i am 13 and i have a college level so i finish books in a short amount of time i also can write up to 40 words in a minute and the harry potter series is my all time favorite
1,Harry potter and the Sorcerer's stone,This was a good book by J.K.Rowling. First Harry gets dropped off at his uncle's house. Then Dudly's birth day comes and they go to the zoo.Dudley pushes Harry and gets a python let loose on him . then Harry gets locked in his room.then he gets a letter. they catch him and rip it up. than he gets more letters and they move far away. Hagrid comes and takes him tom Hogwarts. They go to the bank and then the shops. then Hagrid gets him an owl. they went to the train station and Harry left. there he met Ron and Hermione. They get to the school and get sorted. They accidentaly go to the third floor.They go to the trap door and go through a series of obstacles to get to the stone. Harry won and the day was saved.
5,A magical beginning!,"When I first read this book I read it because many people had told me that it was amazing. So I decided to check it out and when I did I was actually quite surprised. I thought this would be a lame boring story but it actually turned out to be exciting and enchanting!Its a great beginning for a great series. The characters personality's are shown and when you finish the book you can't wait for the second!!Overall: I would definetly reccomend this book. Its fun, enchanting and exciting!"
5,Great book,"Great book, loved it, ,doesn't everyone? Can't wait to stop writing this review so I can read more! Woo hoo"
5,Brilliant!,"Absolutely brilliant! The characters are so well thought out that I really got into it. I was able to relate to Harry Potter and his friends, Hermione and Ron. The use of magical terms were astounding. I found that many of the legends and magical herbs coincided with actual legends and ingredients in magical spells. The history of Harry Potter is revealed in bits and pieces which made me want to read on. Hearing about Lord Voldemort (or should I say He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?) sent shivers up my spine. All in all, this is a wonderful book to read with your children or without!"
5,Best book ever!,My first Harry potter book and I loved it! I can't wait for the next book! I recommend this book!
2,THIS BOOK DRAGS ON AND ON!!!,"When this book first came out a brand new craze came out with it. Thousands of kids were cramming into every store across the world trying to get the book like it was the second coming! So many people were hypnotized by this less than perfect book that they would go out at even midnight to get a book from the first shipment....The first night I had read a few pages my eyelids slowly started to fall... It continued to drag on and on. I've got to admit even though it was pretty boring it was very detailed. You could almost picture yourself there, but then again who would want to!I would not reccomend this book to anyone...Basically, my point is to tell you that this book is a snoozer. Don't be tricked by popularity of them. It's only a fad."
3,what is all this fuss about?!,"___Three stars that I gave are an average - one star for the first half of the book, four for the second.After reading the first 130 pages, I decided to take a rest. Sorry, just couldn't keep on going. Then, few months later, I picked the book up again. From Harry's arrival at Hogwarts, the plot picked up the pace and I found myself actually liking it. But all in all, I am not impressed. It amazes me that such a book stirred so much emotions around the world. It can be viewed as a good metaphor of our own lives and society, though. ___"
2,Not My Type Of Book,"I don't really get why so many people get hooked on these kind of books. I'm not much of a book reader, but isn't this magic stuff kind of old? Well, your probably not going to care about what I think, because everyone else thinks this book is the best. A lot of people my age are going to read it and say ""WOW!This book was great!"" and buy a copy for a friend or keep it as a collecters, but more of ""Harry Potter"" books are going to come out on the market and soon enough I will probably change my opinion."
5,HARRY POTTER IS THE BEST!!,"WHEN I FIRST READ THIS, THIS WAS THE LONGEST BOOK I EVER READ WHICH TELLS YOU THAT I DON'T READ MUCH BUT MY GOD WAS THIS BOOK GOOD!! IT LED ME TO READ ALL THE OTHER BOOKS & NOW CURENTLY HARRY POTTER & THE GOBLET OF FIRE IS THE LONGEST BOOK I EVER READ. I LOVED ALL 4 BOOKS!!"
5,Love,Love this book! Harry Potter is a classic. I am reading it to my kids now and they are really enjoying the adventure.
3,The first time... in english,"The book I bought was the first for me written in english, I'm an italian guy and it was a present for my sister.She the book is really good and it is more funny to read it in the original language instead of in italian..."
3,Great book for the younger of us,I remember when I was younger I was eager to get a copy of this book. With new words no one used or heard of before its time such as muggle or hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry.Great book for the imagination as we follow harry on twists and turns and during confrentations with certain characters.Definetly recommended for the youth of us.
2,I can't see what everybody sees in it!,"This book is not what I would call a masterpiece in my view. Why is this book better than ""A Wrinkle in Time"" or ""The Hobbit""? Why don't I see 900-something 5 star reviews on real books? Could somebody answer this for me? Is it just because this book is popular? Why aren't the other good books?I gave this book 1 star for effort and another for a, well, amusing story.About the sequels, take books like ""Goosebumps."" Way too many sequels, BAD BOOKS. Rushed authors, BAD BOOKS. I predict #3 will be yet another BAD BOOK. Though I can't see how this was a STUPENDOUSLY WONDERFUL FABULOUS book either."
5,A Wonderful Read for All Ages,"Since I had heard so much about this book I asked my friend if I could borrow her copy for the weekend. Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down! It was so interesting, about things from the invisible train platform to quidditch to Fluffy the three-headed dog. I was so intrigued chapter after chapter that I had to keep reading until I finished the book, and I did finish it, that same day! It was by far the best book I had read in my thirteen years. It says that it's for ages 9-12, but I think it is for anyone who enjoys reading about fantasy fiction, that is mixed with a bit of humor and mystery. I highly encourage anyone who has not read it to give it a try and I'm sure you find, also, that you can't simply put it down!"
5,The absolute best book I have ever read! And it's true!,Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone is such a good book! I finished reading it about a week ago but I still can't get over how exciting it was! I've recomended it to some of my friends and told them how much I liked it they deceided to read it.At first they didn't believe a book could be so good but after my friend Alana read the first chapter she said that she couldn't put it down. Now all my friends want to read it even my mom!
4,read it.,"For those few people who haven't read this book yet, i highly suggest it. compared to all the other hp books, it isn't the greatest, but if you compare it to all the other books on the planet, it totally rocks.ps. if you are a hp fan, email me with your opinion on the half blood prince thing."
4,"Fun, but for younger readers","It's a fun, creative story but the writing leaves a lot to be desired. I plan on reading the rest of the series, I just hope Rowling's writing style matures with each book."
4,Good story,"Harry Potter is a good story. I read this book in my summer holiday 3 years ago. And until now, I still remember the story. The story really impressed me much!"
5,wonderful plot and story,"Harry Potter never dreamed he was a wizard. He never thought he would discover a world of magic that was hidden under his nose, or that maybe he'd find a great adventure when he does. This book will enchant you!"
5,One of the best books ever!,I loved this book so much I've read it over 10 time in the last 2 months and I think it's great. If you are a teach I think you sould read it to your class.
2,Hmmmmnnn!,"I was taking PT, via doctors orders, when I ordered this. I had the therapist review it and she said she would not recommend it."
4,macro programming for CNC control,"I have tried to find a book, which has topic of macro programming for CNC controller like FANUC, MAZATROL... but I could not so far. I wonder whether this book has detail explaination and example about macro programming for CNC system. If it has, I will surely buy it."
3,More later,I am only about 20% into the book so can't really comment on it at this point. I will add somethin later.
2,"good idea, tons of errors","The content of the book is good, and the included PCBs will be useful, but you MUST know enough about electronics to detect and correct the numerous errors in the wiring diagrams, etc.The text is a little disorganized and key points and concepts are not as clear as they could be, but the information is good. This is NOT a book for complete beginners. If you're new to electronics, try a NerdKit instead."
5,Radio VCR,"This little unit is perfect to record shows like JIM ROME, Phil Hendrie, Dr. Laura, Rush Limbaugh ""Insert Radio Host here"" or the ball game that won't be on TV and on during your work hours.Get the AC adpator with the unit from .... and a 256SD card from any where else.Pogo also has a great Tech Support staff that quickly helps you in case of any problems and they respond to all emails lightning quick.All and all you should get it if a Radio VCR is something you been wanting for years."
1,One Star for Bad Customer Service Policy,"Ditto to the last upgrade review. It's a neat little machine when it does what you want. But...Did you know that they have radio in Korea (I was handily informed of this by Jeff at Pogo)?And, you can take it to Europe where they have different channel spacing (if you spend the extra $10).They want me to send in the unit and charge me $10, and I just bought mine 10 days ago. Don't believe that all the units out there now are the latest version! There's no way to tell without opening the box and Pogo doesn't seem to care unless you bought it from them.They felt they were doing me a favor by telling me about the updated firmware -- hey, they could have kept a secret. Maybe they should have. Of course, then I found these reviews."
5,A CHILD'S BOOK NOT TO BE FORGOTTEN,"READ IT WITH MY GRANDCHILDREN. WE ALL HAD FUN IN LEARNING THESE SIMPLE BUT CRITICAL MEMORIZATION SKILLS. ALTHOUGH ITS A BIT PRICEY, IT'S WELL WORTH IT ESPECIALLY WHEN OUR GRANDCHILDREN WENT OFF ON THEIR OWN TO COME UP WITH THEIR OWN VERSIONS OF MEMORY IDEAS. THE ARTWORK IS CREATIVE AND REFRESHING. REMINDS US OF MAURICE SENDAK'S UNIQUE STYLE. MY HUSBAND FEELS THIS TEXT FOLLOWS GOOD TEACHING LEARNING FUNDAMENTALS I.E. ACTIVE PARTICIPATION DURING THE LEARNING PROCESS (HUBBY IS BIG SHOT PH.D.)WE WANT TO SEE MORE FROM THE DRUCKMAN DUO."
1,Bushnell should stick to making binoculars,"I had one of these units or something very simular, and it just didn't work. It was supposed to give altitute based on barometric pressure. It just didn't work at all.I set it at known elevations (Blue Ridge Parkway overlook signs) and traveled to the next sign. The readings were all over the palce. Not one accruate reading.I contacted Bushnell and they admitted the unit did not work as it was supposed to. They would not give me my money back. ($75.00)Insted they sent me there botom of the line binoculars which I wouldn't pay $25.00 for. I say they should stick to optics, but I have steered clear of the company alltogether."
4,Good Collection,"As a child of the 40's, western movies were the pastime of choice. This an opportunity to see some of them again."
3,Putting it into real language,"This book would be a good recommendation for those looking for that something ""more"" in their lives, that something that is lingering just below the surface of consciousness. Although there is writing of Dharma and Sutra and various Tibetan names that sound like a mouthful of jumbled letters - for the most part, this is a ""real people"" book with easy to understand concepts and practices."
1,"The Pretentious Path to ""Enlightenment""","Words can not describe how utterly disappointing this book was. The language is arrogant and assuming. Absolutely not intended for the begining Buddhist. It is a superficial attempt to reach the masses(if those masses happen to have a Masters or PHD). At times, it seems, this book was written as nothing more than a long-winded display of his vast vocabulary. Clearly, the author does not get the concept of simplicity.If you are a lost and shallow yuppie searching for a thin attempt at clarity and depth... this is the book for you- enjoy!"
5,One of the funniest books ever written,"I am actually a publisher and we have a line called Humour Classics, in which we reissue out of print classics of humour. And a book I read many years ago, that I loved (I love all of J.P. Donleavey - he is one of my all-time favourite writers) is Fairy Tale of New York. I was checking on Amazon to see if it was available and in print. It is. But I was amazed no-one had done a review. SO here goes: it's brilliantly funny, it would make a great film. The action sequences in the funeral parlour are superb. His prose style is pure magic. Read it!"
4,"a simple, sad story told very well","'Sweet Hereafter' is my first novel from Russell Banks and it surely won't be my last. The reasons are quite clear. In 'Sweet Hereafter' the author employs excellent dialog and fine characterizations to fully capture the rural setting of local tragedy (a fatal school bus crash). The plot itself is very basic, perhaps too basic, but not overly familiar. Normally such books don't interest me but give me excellent writing and I'll read anything.Bottom line: the writing skills of the author trumps a plain Jane and morbid little story. Recommended."
2,You're Most Likely Going To Need To Aquire A Taste For This One,"I'm into this type of music, and I'm familiar with a lot of the artists on this compilation, but the compilation itself isn't as good as it could be. The songs are all songs that really, REALLY take some getting used to. I gave it two stars because it's okay to play the CD as background noise every now and again (and I mean background...like you need to be totally busy and not really paying attention to the music), but other than that, I don't really suggest you spend the money unless you know for sure you are really into these artists and more so...these songs in particular."
2,Large Deviation from the first book.,This book deviates from the first so dramatically it doesn't even feel like it belongs in the series. I'm writing this after completing the entire series. This was the worst of the bunch.
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Dull, mormon wish fulfillment just fantasy. Card may have come up with some clever and complex science fiction, but he has also accomplished some terribly turgid fantasy. A suggestion and loaned from a friend, the stinking rotter. :)"
3,The Final Week,"The book, The Final Week - Contains subject matter in reference to the last week of the life of Christ. Due to the date it was written it is a bit behind modern attacts on the burial and resurrection. However, much useful information may be found in a study of this book..."
1,Do not read this book. Do not buy this book.,"This book contains no useful information that you do not already know at this point. However, if you would to know about what to do with your ""bankable"" star's acting, and you don't know, and they actually gave you a ""bankable"" star... just, don't buy this."
5,Great!,This is the first book I have read written by Amy Fetzer. I am hooked. I ordered 2 more of her books on line. The characters Rein and Michaela captivate the reader. They are full of passion and vitality. They are quick witted and mysterious. Not to mention Hot! It's a definite page turner!
1,Taken for a ride!,Player stopped reading discs after 3 months. Emotronics wouldnot stand behind the product and onkyo would not honor warranty because Emotronics is not a authrorized dealer. Avoid emotronics if you like the idea of having a warranty and avoid onkyo dvdplayers (at least this model).
1,Damaged Merchandise,I received this pendant today and a stone was missing. This was my first purchase with Gem Avenue. I cannot believe that I waited about 10 days to get the package and it came damaged. I guess they have a poor quality control department. It was quite obvious that the stone was missing. Maybe someone there is blind as a bat!
2,Gem avenue,"It was smaller than I had expected, but it is a necklace that I will definitely wear in the future."
5,Great Product,"I found this to be a great product, did what I needed it to, was very functional. Had trouble the first few times I used the crimper (was repairing an old 25 ft. cable from Walmart or somewhere like that) but it was user error on my part. I was not crimping the connector down hard enough. Once I did this, the process went well and the tool worked great"
1,Cheap product,I purchased this for my wife and she did not like it. She said that it was cheap looking and that the pouch would not stay on her pants unless she was wearing a belt.
1,Garbage,The bulbs do not stay connected to the hoses. Poorly made. It doesnt work! Save your money. I actually bought two!
3,Jerusalem Bible--Good Edition,"How do you rate Bibles? I would have given it five stars, but the print is small. I am very satisfied with the product."
5,Jerusalem Bible,"This Bible surprised me....I love how it conveys the Old Testament and the New Testament in construction of the paragraphs that make more sense when reading Scripture. The text is true to the Douay Rheims. The Bible comes with a beautiful tapestry cover.The only negative is the thin quality of paper used. Other than that, it is fast becoming one of my favorite Bibles."
5,The Best True Story!,It's the most accurate translation of the Bible and incredibly readable. A must for anyone who wants to read the Bible!
5,Jerusalem Bible,"I am very happy with this purchase. It was in excellent condition, I have been looking for a bible like this for along time. Thank you.This contained God's Word and the Art Work was surrealist."
1,"Don't be fooled, this is not a Talking Heads album.","Peach Of Immortality: Talking Heads '77, from what I can tell, has nothing to do with the Talking Heads whatsoever. I bought this thinking it was some sort of Talking Heads material, so imagine my disappointment when I heard this CD of random sounds, no drumbeat or vocals, and no hint of the band I payed to hear. I wouldn't have bought this CD if there had been a review of it listed, but there was none. So, I felt it was my duty to write one and perhaps save someone from wasting their money like I did. This is not a good CD."
1,Invisible Helpers is not for me,I didn't care for this book at all. I thought it was way out there. Not my cup of tea!
4,Works as advertised,"In general I find these filters cost far too much. Decent price, decent service from this vendor."
3,Once installed they are beautiful,"Pros: The light fixture is beautiful now that it is installed and arrived timely.cons: Difficult to install. The directions were not very detailed and the illustration was so small it was hard to see even with a magnifying glass. One of the panes of glass was loose and upon careful examination it had been placed in backwards luckily it was fairly easy to correct, but I had to check and tighten all of the frames holding the panes of glass. It comes with two chains that are not in the picture. The chains were too long and required bolt cutters to cut them to fit the appropriate height. The anchor/toggle bolts provided were too short for our ceiling which required buying additional bolts."
3,product is okay,Tried several times to adhere a sink skirt with this....works for several months and then starts to fall off.
5,Perfect,"This product comes with both the hook and fastner sides of velcro and each side has adhesive on the back so you can stick it to what ever you want, I put it on my external hard drive to stick on the back of my computer to keep it out of the way and it works great, keeps it perfectly secure."
2,sticky-back velcro,"This product does not always stay stuck. When velcro is separated, the sticky-back sometimes comes loose."
3,Stick good,"Sturdy yet supple.I had my doubts before application as the tape seemed to shift around but after it was fastened, held like a champ. Be sure you're aware of buying the white color. Black was not an option with this product, not that I found, but white worked for me fine."
5,Handy velcro for PECS,"This velcro is nice since they are circle shaped. I use them for my son's PECS book. They are super strong---more so than average velcro, so don't plan on removing them. They were also a good deal here on Amazon."
1,"Beware old stock, hard to seperate!","Not sure if I just got a bad batch, but I believe it is just older stock because it is near impossible to separate the backing from the actual Velcro. Made in Mexico, not sure if that is the reason?"
5,Glimpse of Robert E. Lee's Daughter's life in 1850's,"Great frank and colorful book of an ancestor of mine, through the Calvert family...life in the 1850's of Robert E. Lee's daughter, and what life was like in the Lee family from a young girl's eyes."
5,decide for yourself,I just received this book from Amazon and felt I needed to add my two cents to the mixed reviews that were so off-puting. This book is terrific!!! There are diagrams and explanations as well as pictures of tools I've seen but had no idea how to use. Ignore the negative reviews and BUY this book.
1,Never read the book.... never will now,"I read the Da Vinci Code, enjoyed it, saw the movie thought it ok. I have not read the book Angels & Demons and am not sure I want to after this movie. I have read others reviews and it seems like I would enjoy it but this movie was SO HORRIBLE I'm not going to. First of all Ewan Mcgregor must think he's still Obi-Wan Kenobi or something because his whole character was just stupid. I enjoy Tom Hanks as an actor but his portrayal of Langdon in this movie seemed way to forced and rushed compared to the da Vinci code. The bits of ""comic relief and irony"" seemed so unrealistic and improbable all I could do was shake my head. If you value 2 1/2 hours do not watch this movie. Even Ron Howard's cinematography (which I am a fan of!)did not do Vatican City any justice of it's history and beauty. PASS - TRUST ME"
5,"Surprised Me, Not a Typical Sequel","Although I tend to shy away from sequels, I broke down and bought this at Giant to pass time away while completing a tediuous task. It was GREAT.There is zero babe factor in this movie, which was a disappointment, it could have been scripted much more engagingly, but three things really blew me away throughout:1) The staging or the access to ostensible Vatican inside and underground areas--presumably not actually within the Vatican, this was all done superbly2) The twists and turns and the ending were great. I actually had tears of surprise at the end and will not spoil it.3) Finally, Tom Hanks and the historical allusions still fascinate me. It would be great if history could be taught so ably, but more deeply and more thoroughly.Absolutely recommended.To browse all 86 of the DVDs that I recommend, visit Phi Beta Iota the Public Intelligence Blog, each links back to their respective Amazon page but only there can you see JUST my DVD reviews."
3,Somewhat better than DaVinci Code,"At least this film isn't a total plodding nodder like The Davinci Code was. This one at least has a bit of life in it, a faster pace, a tighter window of time, and not quite so much dwelling on the symbols or mysteries. Tom Hanks and Ewan MacGregor do decent work for Ron Howard. It's a decent diversion for an afternoon's viewing."
4,Solid Movie,"I found the movie to be very enjoyable. I loved the book when I read it; however, it has been awhile since I read it, so I was able to watch the film without constantly comparing it to the book. I watched the extended version and it moved along at a good pace. Never had a long, drawn out feel to it. I did run into a problem with the digital copy. It kept telling me that I did not have a new enough version of iTunes installed when I have the most current version. Don't know if anyone else experienced this. It's probably something on my end. I just haven't had that happen with the few digital copies that I have downloaded."
3,Angels and Demons,"A disappointment. Not nearly as good as The DaVinci Code. Not a good title for the show, leaves you expecting something very different. Just a plain old cop show, basically."
3,Good for a rental,"Honestly after the horrible job they did adapting the DaVinci Code, I wasn't expecting this to be great. We rented it basically because there was nothing better to get at the store. This was just okay. I honestly found it fairly boring. It was far better than The DaVinci Code, but still it just was boring and predictable. I will say that at least the acting was well done and the story was intriguing. Something just seemed off about it. For one thing I do know that sequentially this is supposed to come before the DaVinci code, but not only is that not eluded to at all, but it was actually marketed as a sequel. I wouldn't buy this but I'm glad I rented it. It wasn't a total waste of time for me I just wish it had been better."
3,Disappointment,"Disappointed in story line - all they do is run around chasing ""clues"" from improbably easily found sources."
1,damaged CD,The CD I received (Angel and Demons) would not play through. It kept freezing on frames early into the movie.
3,it was ok,"The priest lied, hide from other priests, very weird things happened. Part was good that Langdon pursued old time ago clues 7 caught bad the person in the end."
4,"GOOD, BUT NOT GREAT.","I REMEMBER ONE OF THE KNOCKS AGAINST THE DAVINCI CODE AS BEING THAT IT WAS CALLED A GLORIFIED TREASURE HUNT. WELL, I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE DAVINCI CODE , TO ME, WAS FAR MORE INTERESTING; ESPECIALLY HOW YOU WERE DRAWN INTO THE DETAILS OF THE PAINTING OF THE LAST SUPPER AND HOW JESUS' HEIR WAS A FEMALE. TRUTH BE TOLD, ANGELS AND DEMONS IS MUCH MORE THE TREASURE HUNT UP ONE SIDE OF ROME AND DOWN THE OTHER AND BACK AGAIN. TO BE FAIR THOUGH- THE PLOT TWISTS AT THE END WERE VERY GOOD. AND TOM HANKS' CHARACTER DID A GREAT JOB OF BEING AN INTELLIGENT PERSON WITHOUT LORDING HIMSELF OVER THE PEOPLE THAT ASKED FOR HIS HELP....AS SO OFTEN AN EVERYDAY PERSON DOES. AND HIS FEMALE COSTAR DID AN EXCELLENT JOB OF BEING SMART AND SEXY WITHOUT PUSHING HER LUCK WITH THE SEXY PART."
4,Angels & Demons,"Great movie with a well thought out design to hook the viewer in to watch to the end. With Tom Hanks and Ron Howard collaborations you know there can't be anything but great movie magic of the highest caliber. I can not recall ever seeing a movie with either of these men involved that would be considered sub-par or below average. What made this movie especially good was that there was no need to have this be a real sequel to ""The Davinci Code"", because this movie stands on its own. You don't have to see ""Davinci"" to enjoy ""Angels & Demons"". I was proud to add this BluRay DVD to my collection and consider it one of the top five."
2,Picture Quality Was Atrocious,"This is a review focusing not on the ""Angels and Demons"" movie as an artistic work, but on the quality of the transfer to Blu-ray.We watched this film with a number of friend and I was simply aghast with the quality of the image. The day time scenes were decent enough, but the night scenes were murky and muddy. What was worse was the fact that there was ghosting of the image on my screen as if the compression had been done at a low quality setting. The delightful crispness I've grown accustomed to with most Blu-ray transfers was completely absent here... to the point that I double checked the disc to make sure that it was, in fact, a Blu-ray disc.Whoever was in charge of the transfer of this film should be ashamed. It simply is not up to the Blu-ray standard."
2,Lackluster sequel to THE DA VINCI CODE.,"Not that the first film was a classic or anything, but it was still mildly interesting. This film begins well, but then devolves into a ridiculous pseudo-mystery and becomes tedious as it goes on.This is Ron Howard and Tom Hanks in need of a hefty paycheck, and nothing more. Hanks' Langdon is a bore, devoid of any detectable human emotion.This franchise needs to end."
3,"Better than Da Vinci, but that's not hard to pull off","Ron Howard turns the original Robert Langdon adventure from Dan Brown into a sequel to The Da Vinci Code. Tom Hanks returns as the symbologist responsible for the exposure of the Catholic Church's sacred feminine conspiracy, this time hired by the Church itself to prevent a revenge attempt from an enemy scientific cult. The on-location shooting from the first film is substituted here with unconvincing computerized recreations of places like Vatican City, but its somewhat forgivable considering permission was not granted to film there. The booky pace of The Da Vinci Code is alieved here since Langdon is racing against a real-time threat instead of going up against a warble of historical puzzles. The plot moves faster, contains more action, and the players seem less like caricatures and more like characters. It's an improvement on its predessecor and worth a viewing even for those who didn't enjoy the first one."
3,angels and demons dissapointed,this move was ok but it wasnt what i expected i was expecting something like the first one the thrills and the chills left the first 10 mins of the movie they talk alot in this movie. the only thing i can suggest is buy it at goodwill if you find it there but dont be in a hurry to get it
4,Not to be Missed,"I'm not usually a fan of this type of film, but I am an avid Tom Hanks fan. I started watching this fairly late last night, and it had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish with nary a yawn. I liked it much better than ""da vinci code"". I reserve my 5 star ratings for my over the top favorite movies i.e., ""Out of Africa"", ""Fried Green Tomatoes"", ""Dr. Zhivago"", etc., so a 4 rating is an excellent on ""my chart""."
2,Died after 2 1/2 years,"Loved the TV for the fist 2 1/2 years. Had a great picture. But then it started taking longer and longer to turn on. Now, it does not power on at all. Seems to be a familiar problem with Samsung TVs as I researched this online and it seems to affect mostly Samsung brands.Would be curious to see how others are faring with their TV after 2 years..."
5,Great First Experience!!,"Product was shipped and delivered as said by Amazon and the private dealer. I was definitely impressed!!Stephanie, WV"
5,Great Final Chapter?,"DVD arrived early, in new condition. This was a great addition to the Die Hard series; an essential one if you're a fan."
4,Bruce at it again,"Bruce Willis is at it again in the fourth entry of the ""Die Hard"" movies.To be brief. Some things are done excellently,,,such as dialog and of course the stunts. But as with anything when trying to up the ante for the fourth time some things are not up to excellence. Some of the characters and some of the situations are blah blah.Bottom line...a good movie to own, and see over again."
3,AMAZON = LAME,"I love this movie, however days after I purchased it, Amazon dropped the price by $8. I asked for a credit for the difference. They refused and insisted I must ship the original one back to them so that they could credit my account and then bill me the new price and ship it back to me. The logic behind that policy escapes me. At least the movie doesnt appear used like most of their products are."
2,Failure to suspend...,"your disbelief. When the plane hovers over the interchange, and John leaps around like Mario crazed, it was over for me. Then, please explain how an individual is shot, remains standing, the bullet passes thru and knocks another across the room.????. This one killed the series, I hope all were well paid."
1,come on now,ok here s why i give this one stari just saw the unrated version it was best die hard movie next to the 1st oneso i ran out to buy it on blu ray and thats when i found out its only in the pg13 versionits just not a die hard movie gosh gee beep *@#$ you know what i meansure a blu ray player will make a std dvd look better but the sound is a lot better on blu rayim going to wait it out until they put a new version out because you know thats going to happenother than that the movie is top notch
1,Live Free or Die Hard,"I loved this movie, preordered it on Amazon the unrated version only to find the local Walmart with the title ""unrated"" in a 2 disc special!!!.. annoyed.. it was also the same price"
3,Bruce is Too Old,"Definitely not as good as Die Hard #1 or Die Hard #3, but better than Die Hard #2. Bruce Willis is just way too old to be a credible action-hero."
4,Live Free-Die Har,"As usual, Bruce Willis is GREAT. The movie is action packed frombeginning to end.Excellent product - BRAND NEW."
4,Live Free Or Die Hard Delivers!,"I thought the movie was fantastic. A few scenes where it's obviously far fetched. But overall, it was a great movie. As a personal favorite, it ranks 3rd behind Die Hard With Avengence & the 1st one as best Die Hard movie."
2,How low they've sunk!,"Firstly the only thing Die Hard about this movie is the use of the McClane name, that is it. Other than that it is just another buddy cop type film. Not that it is bad for what it is but it is no where near the caliber of any other Die Hard movie. That last scene with the fighter jet is so fake it's throw up worthy. Worth a watch, but don't expect much."
3,A huge gap between DH3 and DH4...,"I just finish watching this movie today. I see what people mean about this being totally different from the other Die Hard movies from the past. To me, the movie was great, alot of action, but the director of this movie really push this movie to far ahead in the future kinda mood. So now there is a huge gap between Die Hard 3 With A Vengeance, and this new Die Hard movie. So if you watch Die Hard 3 and then watch this movie, your gonna have to get use to the huge jump in the timeline. Overall, not a bad movie, I really enjoyed it, but as others pointed out, just doesn't feel like a Bruce Willis Die Hard movie, although some of the sayings that Bruce Willis said from the original Die Hard movie, were thrown back into this one, especially the one at the end of the movie, ""Yippi Ki Yay..."""
5,"I'm not getteing older, I'm getting better (from an old commercial)","Bruce proves once again, old guys can still rock and roll. Yea, it's over the top, as usual, but come on, it's entertainment. And for a sequel, it still ratchets up the excitement level plenty. Bought it for my kid in college for christmas, and mom and I stole it off him on break. We all loved it. And that F-35 ought to drum up some recruits for the Marines, even cooler than the Harrier. Buy it, rent it, re-up, Bruce did.....Ooh Rah!"
3,Die Hard4.0 not up to the expection.......,This sequel does not have any thing new. While watching this movie kind of feels that you have already watched a movie with a similar story line. Three starts are only for the action in the movie which is good. Not a kind of movie which a die hard fan would expect.
3,Ka-Pow!!,"This is a pretty good film, and the transfer to Blu-Ray works beautifully. The sound is terrific, and it is fast moving. My problem is there are a couple of scenes which totally stretch reality to the breaking point. I like to let my skepticism go as much as anyone, but this film has some real deuseys. The above average Gladiator type would be hard pressed to live through this one. Justin Long held his end of the bargain playing a scared computer geek very well without going completlely over the top. I have to say it was probably second best of the Die Hard films. I can only give it three stars."
4,Die Hard Again!,"I wanted to see this when it came out but was unable. I am a great fan of the Die Hard series and of Officer McClain. It did not fail to deliver the Die Hard punch in action, quips, and mysteries turned into oppurtunities to survive. Canted wait to see the next!"
4,mclain is back and thers a lot to hack,"like part 3 he's out on the streets all over the place alot of computer hacking, it hought it may of mentiond a little more about his wife and son notjust the daughter,and i felt the plot an special effecs was better than part 3 but still not as godo as part 1, 2, i thought bruice was pretty good being 12 years since the last one came out. alot of action and better than part 3 but the plot in 1,2 was still better to me"
5,One of the best,"Mel Gibson really outdoes himself in this flick. Fantastic effects! Plot doesn't matter with this film, though it was acceptable."
4,Good BlueRay Movie Title,"I will limit myself to the technical side of the release:Blue Ray transfer is excellent. Very smooth payback of Video and DST-HD Master audio track.The sound tack is a little bit not as exciting as it could be for the movie like this. Low frequency effects are almost not existent (very rare). Sound engineers would get (B-) from me for the job and ""no bonus"".Video transfer is very good (A+)."
5,Bruce is my Boyfriend!,"After watching the ""old"" Die Hard movies over and over again, it was exciting to see that John McClane was getting back in the saddle again!This is the cream of the Die Hard movies. Justin Long was a hoot in this movie as well. You'll want to add this to your personal DVD library, just make sure you get it in FULL SCREEN!Yippee ki yayyyyy!"
4,Love action movies,Big fan of action movies. This movie deliver the action that it promise. Like the different spoken languages it comes in. Recommend for the action type and bruce willies fan.
4,just as good as the original,I loved this movie and I can't recomend this one enough to any Bruce Willis fan or any fan of the series. you won't be disappointed with this one.
4,Great addition to Die Hard series,Nice combination of action and humor. With Willis and Olyphant in the movie you can't go wrong. Both actors are dynamic.
4,"Kept me going....and I am NOT a ""Die Hard"" fan!","I have not seen Bruce Willis' detective John McClane since the first DIE HARD twenty years ago. Action films are usually my least favorite genre. Who cares! This was one edge-of-your-seat,formulaic,tense and funny film for pure entertainment. I didn't think about the plot or character angst for one minute. I was entertained and had fun. What I did enjoy was the seamless editing and Michael Kamen soundtrack for this film.This film was shot in my neighborhoods of Baltimore and D.C. and it was great fun watching the two cities shot and pieced together to make Washington. For those wondering about Woodlawn in the film, it is a Baltimore suburb where the Social Security Administration is located. The only thing that goes on there is the highest murder- rated neighborhood in the city!The packed theatre where I saw this film howled when we saw that!!!"
3,Redefining health care,this book had some good ideas that could have been conveyed in less than half of the space. It was quite redundant.
4,Redifining Health Care,"The book is in excellent condition, but it took a long time to get mailed to me."
2,Not For Me - but pretty,"Very Pretty but a limited number of arms and my family was not even in the book. For such an expensive work, I expected my family to be there!"
2,You get what you pay for.,"First of all they were too small and I am having to buy a whole new pair, a different shoe altogether because I was not thrilled with these.They have a smooth rubber sole instead of the hard leather you normally find in character shoes.The upper material does not give very well which makes breaking them in next to impossible."
1,These shoes run very small,"These shoes run about 1 full size too small. I ended up paying about twice as much for the pair I now have. I purchased them from a local dance shop in town. They are much more comfortable than these.When returning these, you have to pay the shipping both ways (when you originally purchased them and when you return them). I was out just as much money in shipping fees, as it would have cost me to go ahead and purchase the more expensive, more comfortable shoes locally. I don't recommend these."
1,The Hypnotist's Stooge,"Self-serving predictability is to be expected from this kind of thing but I was surprised to find it so completely, almost improbably, dull considering the life it purports to recount. Synopsis: A frigid romantic stumbles blindly into cinema, seven (or eight) marriages, two abortions, and a homocidal daughter. Reading the love letters Turner sent her murdered gigolo will tell you more than anything you'll find in this publicist's dream account of a battered spouse, either about the murder or the woman herself."
3,The Chillout Sessions Series is Slipping.,"Chillout Sessions 7 was OUTSTANDING. Unfortunately, Chillout Sessions 8 and 9 are very mediocre at best. I just purchased Chillout Sessions 10, I hope it is better than 8 and 9...I own every chill and lounge CD, for the most part... I'm really dissaponted in this series anymore."
1,What a piece of garbage!,"This toy is the most useless piece of junk that we have ever purchased. It really does NOTHING worthwhile - makes a dumb phone call every hour or so when you ask, Barbie says one or two words and THAT'S IT! This toy does NOTHING else.I can't believe what a rip off this thing is and that Mattel would find it worthwhile to sell to the public.If I could give this thing zero stars, I would."
4,4 year old loves this phone,"This phone is expensive and doesn't give many options on programmable favorites, hobbies, etc. as other reviewers have stated. Personally, I was not very impressed with it, but my 4 year old daughter LOVES this phone and is so impressed that it knows her friends and brothers names. She has had hers since Christmas and it works perfectly. It does call her just like it should. It sounds just like a real phone ringing so it sometimes confuses family members (thinking the real phone is ringing). I think this toy would be most appropriate for a 2-5 year old. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it has such limited options when it comes to programming it."
3,Behringer VMX100 DJ Mixer,Its great very simple though not that many features great for a starting Dj
1,Made out of paper! Piece of junk!,"This flag is a disgrace to POW's! It is poorly made, and when I attached it to a groomet, the ring ripped and nearly fell off. Garbage!"
2,Not much help,Not much help in making the DR-880 productive. A little help but I'm still not getting any songs from it.
3,"No problems reading, a bit yellow","The book is fine for reading, but a bit brittle and yellowed pages, stains. The listing said there were issues, so no misleading there -- I am only saying the condition, as advertised is about a 3 of 5."
3,Interesting review of 1950s in America,"I read this with interest not because it describes today's society, but it certainly gives some background to why things are the way they are in America today. I found the description of how the social side of playing the ""game"" in the military was particularly interesting. Easy reading and provocative in some chapters (e.g. being Jewish and being excluded)."
5,Great unexpected twist on old theme,Powerful aliens who conquer the world are a sci-fi staple. This book turns the story around when the aliens have problems running the world. Comic cameos by John Kennedy and others.
5,Brother Termite,I like the book. I read it twice. Bought the book in 1993. I highly recommend the book. It combines the best of several genres.
4,I must be a masochist,"Though I know by now that the endings of her books are gonna leave me dissatisfied, I still read them.I read them because between the front cover and the ending there is always astonishingly good storytelling. This book was no exception. An alien invasion story told from the side of the aliens. It took me awhile to figure out that was what she was doing and then suddenly, just like that, it changed the entire way I was reading the book.That angle made me think about what was happening more keenly than I was doing so up to that moment and actually made me go back and start again. Simply amazing writing. Again though, that ambiguous ending...Still, I recommend it. You can still find her books here for pennies. At that price, don't be afraid to check her out. You may enjoy them tremendously."
1,BEWARE! THIS IS A CARTOON VERSION OF THE CLASSIC FILM,"Take note before you buy this video. It is not the 1956 classic film by Kon Ichikawa. It is an animated version. I am sure that the rave 5 star review from Charlottesville above is intended to refer to the Ichikawa version. I think someone got their wires crossed on this one. If you can find the Ichikawa version anywhere, buy it. It is a true anti-war classic - right up there with Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory."""
3,Brunton Lite Tech 10x42,"These binos have good optics and lite gathering ability. However, the minimum focus distance is about 19' which is not great. Also, the eye spacing is strange in that I have to move the eyepieces as close together as possible to create the field of view. I am ususally in the center of the range on other binoculars. The neck strap included is inadequate so I'll have to buy another. For the price I'm happy with them."
3,Nice intro series but too expensive,"This is a nice introductory series on A&P. I would have liked it to be a bit more indepth educationally but then, maybe it was intended for a different audience. It make a great series for high school level classes and non science majors. I found some (but not all) of the sections useful as an introduction to various body systems in a college level class. My main complaint about this series is the price. Considering how long it has been on the market it should be considerably less expensive."
2,No different than my indoor antena,"I read some other reviews said this antenna is good, buy it to replace my indoor antenna and hope it can get better HD signals. Set it up, set TV to re-scan all stations, don't even get one more station at all, it make no different than my indoor antenna. May be need to put it outdoor, set up ladder climb up on the roof top and point to the right direction, make no different again. I am not asking for much, if it get a few channels more I will keep it, but well, return it for refund."
3,Serve the purpose...,This thing served the purpose as a fold up bed but it was hard as a rock.I saw where many people called it very firm but I beg to differ.This thing is hard but not quite as hard as the floor...that is why I gave it three stars.
2,Disappointing mattress.,The cushioning is too hard. I do not like the slick cover. Have not decided whether or not I will return it.
3,If you use it a lot...be ready to replace them often,"This thing wears out with extended use. We had people live in our house for a couple months and after a months use, they already lose there firmness. It got to a point where we had to double stack. Granted the people using them were by no means heavy, so it was kind of a shocker. However, this still beats sleeping on the cold hard floor.In all honesty, I probably would buy another because I myself get a good nights sleep in using them. But then again I can sleep in just about anything.If you are looking for durability..look elsewhere. If you are looking for a fairly cheap fold up mattress that can be stored easily, then this is a great item for you...especially if you don't plan on using it often. When it was new, it felt fantastic...but after the wear...it feels...meh.Let me know if you have questions"
5,BETTER THAN CHEAPYONES OUT THERE,WOW IT IS REALLY COMFY AND REALLY SOFT.BOUGHT ONE FROM ANOTHER STORE NOT GOOD.THIS IS NO COMPARISON.ITS SIMPLY THE BEST
1,terrible product,"Initially this product seemed to be fine, but than while I was pushing my elbow against the mat, I noticed holes in it. I checked them later, but they were still there, didn't ""inflate"" back.I don't know what this mat is made of that pressure leaves holes in it."
3,"Costco better, but check first","I bought one of these at Costco for around $45. It looks like it's exactly the same. Unfortunately, they only had black ones available (I had wanted brown). Regardless of the color, you have to plan to cover it with some additional fabric anyway. The existing fabric is VERY low quality / cheap.The one I bought came with a ripped corner. I'm planning to ask Costco for an exchange today. My membership recently expired so we'll see how good their customer service is..."
5,Great item,We have both the pooh and tigger blanket and my daughter loves them. She has loved them since about 3 mos old. She sleeps with one of them every night. I have bought these for showers also.
1,Not good,After 1 month the cord broke in half. It appears the cord must have been rotten or too long in stock
1,Vivitar 28-300 lens for Nikon AF,"We own this lens for several years using it on Nikon F70. I was very disappointed with the over-all quality (esp. sharpness) of the lens. Tamron 28-200 lens is supposed to be also on the ""lower"" end of the quality scale - I tried it once and WHAT A HUGE DIFFERENCE compared to the 28-300. In other word: even the much critized Tamron 28-200 is better. Very likely a 28-300 even with reasonable compromise would unreasonably stretch the budget and perhaps the OEM of Vivitar (Vivitar does not have his lens factory) did the best they could for that money. I am curious, how good or bad is the 28-300 offering from Tamron. The Vivitar Series 1 IMHO does not deserve the ""Series 1"" name. I am affraid, in order to cover a long range with better quality one would still need 2 or even 3 lens."
2,Not scary,"This movie is only for kids or those who saw it as kids and adults with fond memories of it. I bought it and instantly traded it in to Amazon. It wasn't scary but was boring and annoying, very low budget and outdated. Only for hardcore fans. Halloween, Friday The 13th, Piranha, Poltergeist, Carrie and Dressed To Kill are far better for suspense and drama from that era (late 70's and early 80's)."
4,Dark Night of the Scarecrow,"The movies begins somewhat slow, but soon picks up and holds your interest all the way through. Charles Durning does a very good job of making you hate him. The movie takes on a creepy, eerie, & scary feel with the dark, country side setting. Don't look for any spectacular special effects. When you have a good story, acting and direction, too many special effects can get in the way and ruin a good Halloween-type movie."
3,Scary Little gem,"After reading several of the reviews about this movie, I decided to take a chance and purchase it. The cinematogrophy was crisp and crystal clear. The acting was above par; even though it was a made for t.v movie. The scenes were loosely constructed, but kept you guessing. I gave this film a 3 out of 5; due in large part because of the loosely constructed scene actions, but as I said, the overall picture quality was great. This movie however; is not worth the $10 I paid for it- $5.00 would have been a fair price."
2,Dover Publiher's Listen and Learn German,"I am a big fan of the Dover Listen and Learn languages series. I greatly appeciate the formatting and usefulness of the materials for those begining to study a new language using the ""phrase method"". Nothing but good things to say about their Japanese CD course. However the German CD version is horrible. I cannot understand the German speaker, sound quality is terrible. The recording is abismal!Dover should really pull this version ""off the shelf"". It casts a bad light on otherwise good materials. I also have the ""Listen and Learn French"" CD version; it is much better than the German version however not nearly so good as was their original vinyl series from the 70's & 80's.Just don't spend the money for this German language course. You will be very disappointed. I suggest the Pimsleur beginer's course as a vastly superior option. Viel Erfolg!"
4,"Great, if you know what you're doing","Great manual control.Not so much on auto mode. Better take a TTL flash, if you don't want to think."
1,It is not worthy the money.,I called up their support number. Twice I got the answers of they are sending me an online link of the driver for two calls I made. So far I have not received any email they promised to send. The last call I was told I am going to get it within 10 minutes. It is not the case.I am disappointed not receiving the link so far. Don't know what is going on there. Only hope eventually I can get a workable driver.
3,only a replica,"yep, i had one that looked exactly like that. why would a solid wood handle look like hard wax? a real battle ready sword isnt worth only 55 bucks. amazon isnt the place to find real swords if thats what u want."
2,"Dark, gorey and kill, kill, kill","Though the movie does have some redeeming qualities with its cinematography; it lacks a decent story line, it is kill, kill and more kill from beginning to end. I am not sure what I expected but it is not worth the two hours."
5,Pathfinder,"I saw this movie in the theatre and I was excited that it was coming out on DVD so I went to get it right away on tuesday. The movie was great, lots of action and it was pretty violent and bloody, but if that doesn't bother you then you should be okay with this movie. There wasn't a whole lot of talking, but there really didn't need to be. I don't know how much money it made while in the theatre, but I do know that it got bad reviews, but just don't listen to them. This is a great movie and deserves a chance. If you liked 300 you'll like this one too. So whether you rent this, or buy it you won't regret doing so."
2,no damage control,"way to violent, did not even watch the whole movie, violent beyond discription, could have been good if more time was spent on a real story, too bad"
3,Pathfinder DVD In dts,"This filmn is very dark...in color and light. It is hard to make out who is who, and what is going on. I guess I really did not care for the movie and It was difficult for me to figure out what it was about. It is in 5.1 dts and I alway's look or movies that are in dts..the sound is so good. Unfortunately, the sound could not help this movie.<>L<>"
3,Worth A Look,"To be honest I wasn't really expecting much from this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. The fight scenes, while graphic, were filmed really well and the cinematography adds to the demeanor of the movie. The plot was a little flimsy and there were some definate holes but all in all it was entertaining. Karl Urban did a great job. I would have liked to have scene some more drawn out battle scenes and a little more character development with the Native Americans in the movie. If you like this type of movie, I would definately recommend watching it."
4,Pathfinder is a very cool movie!,"I heard a lot of negative reviews on this film. I never listen to bad reviews as people seem to think that when they bash a movie they are ""smarter"" or better informed than others. So I reserve judgment for myself. Once again it happens. Pathfinder is a very cool movie. It reminds me of Frank Frazetta's art. Great set pieces,good acting,direction and cinematography. If you are into this kind of film then you will like it. If not then don't bother you won't understand. Too bad they probably won't make more like this."
3,Gory Dark Ages fantasy,"There were plenty of times where this was a 2 star film and only a few when it was four stars but overall it comes in as a 3 minus. The idea is interesting, Viking conflict with American Indians but it's done in such an over the top manner, any historical point is lost. The Vikings are dressed like Fantasy figures and act with no logic what-so-ever. There is lots of gore and it's all done in the darkest of shades so that it often looks like night-time. I kept thinking that there was clearly a budget of sorts available and that it was a shame that it was spent making a sort of Dark Ages 'teen slasher'. While most of it is cliched (as much as the film defies genre classification) and sometimes almost stupid in terms of believability, there are a few surprises and I guess it is generally adequate for killing time when there is nothing else available."
3,"Decent action film, worth a watch, but not a favorite","This film doesn't do anything that hasn't been done before. A viking child gets left behind because he does not honor his fathers wishes, and is embraced by the natives of the North American Lands. He is part of a prophecy of freedom from the ""Dragon People"". He knows the lay of the land, the ways of the natives, and the way of the Dragon People, and just the man to free the New World. Of course there is a love story in here, and a wiseman imparting wisdom throughout. The action is intense, there are very graphic scenes of gore (at least 10 or more beheadings). A real testosterone feastival. Worth a watch once, but not a keeper by anymeans"
2,hard to use,This book doesn't have an index so that you can scroll down and read Persuasion before you read Emma. This is a real inconvenience and I wish I hadn't purchased it.
3,Too many errors...,This is a lovely volume of Jane Austen's work and I would've given it 5 stars if there were less typographical errors dotted throughout the entire book.
5,Exquisite Book,"I have never owned a more beautiful book in my life. The hardcover is covered with a sturdy dark blue (almost black) cloth with texture. The words and patterns are engraved in gold into the cloth. The cover picture is also sunken in, smooth and laminated. Every aspect of this book is elegant and sturdy.The edges of the white pages are colored blue-grey, complimenting the cover.This book is roughly just as thick and as heavy as a bible, so most people should not have trouble reading it in bed.This will certainly be one of my most prized books. I highly recommend this edition, if not for the content, for the beauty of a collectors item of a classic novel.Ordering this from the UK to east coast U.S.A., it took less than 2 weeks to receive.I showed the book to a friend and she even WOWed over it, saying the appearance alone made it a very striking coffee table book. It is worth way more than the 5.86 pounds I paid."
2,"Silly stories, silly women!",The women are silly and it seems that money is the main focus along with the men and especially the women marrying well. That means to someone with wealth. How these stories became movie material I don't know!
1,"hello, is anyone home?","Hello Amazon, im sorry but your website presentation while shopping for books is useless. All I wanted was a paperback set of Jane Austen books. Seems simple enough. Apparently not, the first set brought up says paperback in the title but way later the actual description claims it is an audio book???The customer reviews, supposedly for this book, were a mix of reviews from 6 different Jane Austen products. Hardback, paperback, video, etc.The actual description of the title was so buried in screen after screen of add ons, reviews, additional suggestions, etc it took awhile to find and then it was not a review of the product but an overall review of Jane Austen books. Most of the Jane Austen sets and compilations did not even list what titles were included. Come on folks! You would think that would be common sense information.Amazon Management - Please Read This. Thanks"
2,Not what I wanted. Not listed as a compendium.,I was searching for the collected works in separate volumes. This failed to mention that it was a compendium and therefore I was stuck buying this and also the books I really wanted somewhere else.
5,Excellent Book Bargain,"I highly recommend Jane Austen's delightful writing to one and all. Each one of her, unfortunately too few, novels are true classics in every sense of the word. She is witty and very readable. Her novels are deliciously addictive and you will enjoy rereading them over and over.I purchased this edition for my 17 y/o daughter so that I could keep MY own copy of this book available for myself...I am so envious! This is a lovely, expensive-looking book which sells for an amazingly low price. There are cheaper hardback copies but the extra $4.00 for this one is very much worth 3 times that small amount. The leather binding and original artwork make this an excellent bargain."
3,Good lens and durable for the price.,"I owned this lens for my Ricoh MF camera for about 5 years and it is still going . For some time was the most used lens in my outfit. It has all the focal distances you need for people, children and portrait. The picture quality is ok, nothing outrageous but enough for a beginner , student or like me, family photographer."
5,cando yes,I ordered itI used itit worked with in a couple daysnow others with to use itthey can get there own
1,Always good to see bands crap on their fans,"This doesnt deserve 1 star. I spent 20 bucks on this and the schism cd. And what do you get? Nothing. One video...not even all of the videos they've made on the cd...just one. Oh but then, you get the joy of listening to comentary with some jerk-off, who has nothing interesting or valuable to say about anything ""I remember one time I had a beer with tool. Neat.""But then you get to listen to the remix...which sounds like somthing a highschool student could have put together.Tool has been my favorite band for quite some time now, and I'd just like to thank them for crapping all over their fanbase by releasing this garbage. Download 2 of their music videos and you'll have more than this dvd can offer."
5,Heady,This is one hell of a movie. The menu's are custom Alex Grey!! The remix is enlightening. I would highly recommend buying this.
2,Give me one reason why they didn't put both videos on one disc?,"I find it insulting that TOOL released each video on seperate DVD's, and that they have the nerve to charge $10 dollars for each. There's only one video, a commentary (not by the band?), and a lone remix. You guys are clueless if you don't see the greed in this!! Let me guess, the next album is gonna be sold song by song and we are gonna have to buy 12 or 13 cd's with one song on each, and only then will we have the entire album. I bought Salival 5 years ago and payed $27 dollars for 5 videos, an entire album of live and unreleased tracks, and a beautiful presentation in the artwork. I love these videos and think the band's music is amazing, but I will not buy into this obvious greed! Think for yourself!"
2,What is this supposed to be? I thought it was TOOL live,"What is this supposed to be? Now I know these guys are incredible and all but I am totally confused. Maybe if I were ten years younger and stoned / trippin out of my mind it might be a bit more entertaining.Very visual, they really take their time with the cinematography. Commentary is kinda stupid but funny also.Glad I didn't spend very much.They are due for a live performance DVD."
5,Excellent compass,"The Silva Ranger type 15 used to be a very good compass, They changed it and is now an absolute joke. This Brunton Nexus Elite is the same as the old Silva Ranger type 15 and is an excellent compass. The person who rated it and complained that it was not digital does not know enough about a compass to be buying one in the first place.(Does it even remotely look digital?) I have done forestry work for a long time and I would take this compass anywhere. Very accurate for somebody that knows how to use a compass."
1,Bubble,"The compass developed a bubble which grew to over 1/2"" in diameter. Obviously, it's just a defective compass, but it is not returnable because it contains hazardous materials, and I have been unable to contact Brunton for over a month despite half a dozen messages (their only customer service option). Try Silva compasses--the company has a public return policy for any Silva compass."
2,Auto shut off maddening,"Don't buy this, get a 283/285HV instead. It powers down after 5mins, when you're least expecting it. I've missed so many shots because the flash was not ready when I was. Poor design feature which cannot be overridden."
3,Disappointing,"I can't be too harsh I suppose but I am afraid this film reinforced some negative stereotypes. Sure it's a low budget flick and that's OK - a gay romance is going to have a limited market and therefore it's going to have to be put together ""on the cheap"". What I can't forgive is the story itself because it had real potential to show case a life most people know nothing about and then descended into a well worn path of promiscuity, broken hearts and a compromise that leaves the main character appearing weak and lacking in principles. There are a lot of light hearted moments and that really helps so overall it's not bad but I feel it could have been a lot better even without a higher budget."
2,Preaches a bad message,"For an obviously very low budget film I thought it was Ok. Many of the scenes were quite good and the relationship between the two leads was quite believable. It tackles a sensitive subject quite well - but as other reviewers have mentioned I too must agree that the ending was quite disappointing. I think everyone deserves to have their standards and the film seems to suggest that ""give in"". Love is NEVER enough to maintain a relationship. Two people MUST have common ideas, values and goals in order for it to last. The film says that Love is what is left after you stop judging. This is TRUE, but it does not mean that you should let go of your personal standards in a relationship, as it seems to suggest."
5,Great romp,"While it is certainly true that Nietzsche makes several argumentative errors and is somewhat inconsistant at times, the Anti-Christ is a fantastic read. Although it ended his career, I think this book is a great way to be introduced to his work. The Anti-Christ may not be his best argued work, although it does contain some masterful indictments of the Christian ethos, but it is probably the work that best captures his spirit. This book is a must read for anyone interested in discovering what Nietzsche's true ideas concerning Christianity and religion are, and so that we can dispose of the simplistic garbage that paints him as a nihilist. A little dose of Nietzche's forthrightness, courage and honesty in the expression of ideas, however controversial or unpopular they might be, is just what our modern world needs."
3,"""Jarheads"" vs. Air Force Special Ops","This is a typical ""military"" action thriller with conspiracy elements that can be read as a stand-alone book. A rogue Air Force General with his own AF Special Ops unit vs. the US President with his Marine Corp escort and the ""Scarecrow"" in a battle for control of a secret military laboratory & facility. Isolated in the desert the ""team"" is trying to prevent a ""holocaust"" and a regime change. There was a lot of unnecessary ""fluff"" added to expand the pages and sometimes I felt that story (plot) was going in circles. Yes, some of the exploits are unrealistic from a military standpoint, put this is escapist fiction.Overall, a fairly good page tuner with some interesting plot twists.This is a good book for your ""escapist reading"" by the pool on vacation etc. Read and toss (or give away)"
3,Area 7,"While the plot is interesting and there is tons of action in this novel, the lack of character development hurts this novel immensely. There are several characters with colorful nicknames that you never really get to know making it difficult to figure out what drives these folks to their heroics. There are some annoying inaccuracies too like calling the yoke of a Boeing 707 the collective. Airplanes don't have collectives, helicopters do. Overall a very average piece of work with tons of action, albeit a little hard to follow at times."
1,Sad at best,This book is very Liberal sided. University Of Phoenix (Axia) charges its students $85 for this piece of trash. It is not worth what Amazon is charging either. A student is better off teaching the material to theirself via the Internet.
4,Essential Chest and Shoulders: An Intense 6-Week Program,"I have found this book to be very informative. It shows you the right way to do your weight training. It also has a lot of useful programmes that you can do, I am already seeing the results of following the intructions given in this book."
2,outdated,I thought the material in the book was outdated and sent it back. I was refunded quickly without any hassles.
4,A good work,"THis album is the most <<difficult>> by Paradise Lost. It takes many listenings to like it. In the beginning i didnt like it except their best song in this album -As i die. I decided to give it a chance because it is Paradise Lost and one of my favorites bands. So i did.........and now i like it. Its doom , heavy and very slow music ..but once you get it you are gonna like it a lot. I give 4 stars and as i know in the future they will write much better albums."
2,Please make it stop,"Where do I start? Some of the worst musicianship I have ever heard. The guitar solos are so horrible, they almost sound like an attempt at humour. Particularly in the opening track, ""While Mortals Watch the Day"". The drumming is also way below acceptable, making the entire band sound very un-polished. The riffs are not tight, repetitive and mundane. It does provide comedic entertainment value, however, thus earning two stars."
4,wonderful vacuum,"Almost everthing is excellent, except the short hose that requires me to carry the unit from my shoulder. I prefer to pull even a small vacuum on the floor."
5,Solved all my kitten litter problems,"i've tried several different types of boxes. In fact, i was thinking about getting rid of my Hemmingway kittens because I hat messiness and clutter. This is the first time in 50 years i had a pet. This litterboxsaved my pets. No mess no fuss. i was afraid it was too deep for them since they were so small. Put it was no problem."
3,wish it worked.,"My 15 lb maine coon used it no problem, my mentally hanicapped siamese however? Started peeing on the carpet and rugs and pooping outside it. Wished she would use it, as is cut down on little tracking by almost 100%. maybe Ill try again later."
4,Clevercat taught my clever cat to pee in the toilet,"I purchased this about a month ago after reading positive user reviews, and anticipating possible problems with my dog getting into the litter (which turned out to not be an issue). My cat adjusted quickly to the top-hole design. I have noticed, however, that sometimes my cat prefers to hang over the top and drop his payload- thus, he doesn't actually get down into the box, and doesn't cover his poop- which stinks to high heaven.A side effect of this behavior is that it has apparently encouraged my cat to start using the toilet to pee in. If the lid and seat are up, I have seen my cat jump on the edge of the bowl, and balance on all 4-s while peeing in the toilet- he hits the mark every time! Now, any time the toilet lid and seat are left up, we are likely to find pee in the toilet. Sounded great- until my wife started complaining that we need to train the cat to flush the toilet too!!"
3,Not dog proof,"This is good litterbox if you don't have a dog. I really do think it cuts down on litter tracking all over the place. My problems w/ it are twofold:1. I have a large german shepherd that loves to eat cat poop and he can easily get his head into the hole. So unless your dog is pretty small, it won't be dog-proof.2. One of my cats is terrified of enclosed spaces and chose to pee in the fireplace, instead. So it doesn't work for all cats...some of them are just too stubborn and stuck in their ways."
2,Not for older or larger cats,"I have two cats, the older one is 16 and weighs 16 pounds and the younger one is 10 and weighs 8 pounds. My larger cat was able to use the box but with some difficulty. Because of the amount of effort needed to get in and out of the box, he decided that he would no longer use it after about 2 weeks. Instead, he used a decorative rattan basket in my living room one Sunday morning.On another note, this box was recommended to me in a large chain pet store and I was told that the ribbed lid would catch litter but this just wasn't the case. There was litter all over the floor around the box.This might work with a young and/or skinny cat but is not a good idea for an older cat who is set in his ways."
4,decreases litter tracking,"I got this from a recommendation from a friend who said this litterbox didn't allow her cat to get litter all over the place after the cat did its business. My cat was tracking litter all over the carpet (even with litter control mats outside the litter box), so I thought I'd give this a try. While not reducing the litter tracked on the carpet completely, I'd say it's about 90% less than the standard Wal*Mart litter boxes I'd tried in the past.The only bad thing is because of the hole on top, the smell does escape more easily than front entry litterboxes with doors/flaps. But with the lack of litter on the carpet, it's completely worth it!"
3,Clevercat litterbox,"Does what it is supposed to do, the cats seem perfectly fine with it and it helps keep litter off of my floor. BUT, if your cat is normal size (10 lbs or larger) this box is just way, way too small. I have two little female cats, both petite, both weigh about 9lbs, and this works OK for them, but I do wish that Clevercat came in a larger size. To that end I may just have to be clever, purchase a big plastic container with a sturdy top, and make a larger cat bathroom myself. The concept wins five stars, the size takes away two."
3,Great Idea... If only my cats agreed!,"I thought that since I was getting this for kittens, they would be okay with using the box and the negative reviews from others wouldn't hold true. This was the case for a month or so, but now that they're almost a year old they rarely use it. When they do, we find fecal matter on top of the box, smeared on the sides of the box... it's just gross! We've moved the box to the patio in an attempt to lure the cats to do their business outside, and when they go in the house it's now in a Buddha box."
4,Great for the average cat,"I love this litter box for keeping the litter tracking and odors to a minimum. I used it for years until one of my cats became quite large and could no longer use this one well. His head had to remain out of the top hole, which limited him covering his waste, so the smell became a problem. Otherwise, it would be 5 stars."
4,Fixed dog getting into the box,"I don't know if my cat likes this, but I do because my dog can't get in it. I have tried many containers to keep my dog out of the cat litter, and this one works flawlessly. He can't get into it.My cat I don't think really likes it, but she uses it. If you have a large cat I don't think they would like this because of it being confining, but my little cat fits in it just fine. She has started just standing on the top and aiming down the hole to poop, which is odd, but whatever, as long as my dog doesn't eat it.It is essentially just a storage tub with a hole in the lid, although it does have little grooves on the top to get the litter off the cats feet and the plastic is sturdier than a storage tub (although you probably could try making this yourself)The other nice thing about this is that because the cat has to jump out and walk across the top to get out they can't kick litter out of the box and I don't have litter all over the floor."
4,Needs a wider base,"I guess when this product was designed, they assumed that the weight of the litter in the bottom would stabilize it. Well, I use an incredibly light litter made out of cedar shavings, and yesterday I came home to find that my cat had tipped the whole litter box over. I had noticed it wobbling at times when he stood on it, and he seemed a bit apprehensive, but I didn't honestly think the thing would fall over. I have no idea yet if my poor kitty was standing on it when it fell, but I assume he was. Now I guess I have to find a way to stabilize it. I really hope that doesn't make him stop using it because I'm pretty pleased with everything else about it.I would caution people who have large cat against getting this particular box. My cat is a medium-sized male, and he seems pretty large when he stands on this thing."
1,Horrible product,"If you want your previously litter-trained cats to start urinating in a chair in the corner of the room and ruin your hardwood floors, buy this product.Our cats hated it. The space was too small for them to climb into. They started peeing on top of the platform, then decided, it was too much trouble. So they found the next best thing: a chair in the corner of the room. By the time we discovered it, the urine had already ruined our floors.I called Clever Cat, and they wanted nothing to do with returning my money. In fact, the man on the phone was a bit of a smart@#$. He insisted that most companies don't take back their own products...which is a big load of crap!DO NOT BUY THIS HORRIBLE PRODUCT. Save your floors, and keep your cats happy!"
4,I really like this litter box!,"We purchased this litter box a couple months ago because we were moving to a new apartment. We have a male cat that pees high and would spray outside of the old litter box with the open front. With the Clevercat that problem was solved. There's no way he can pee outside the box with the opening on the top and there is no strong urine smell either when he goes. We have three cats in our home and all of them use this box. Like some other reviewers have stated, it does not stop the tracking of litter, but I'll take a few pellets of litter over a puddle of smelly pee any day."
3,Doesn't work as well as it should,"The idea behind this seems sound, but in reality, my cat still tracks as much litter out of this as he would otherwise. In fact, when he jumps to get out of the box, he kicks up a fair amount of litter he probably wouldn't otherwise. If your cat is an enthusiastic digger, this may contain some of the spray, but if you're hoping to eliminate tracking and spilled litter, you will be disappointed."
5,Skeptical to Satisfied,"I was not keen on shelling out $35 for a tupperware but did so hoping this would release me from extreme cat box despair. The item performs well WITH CLAY LITTER which is all I have used. My current housing situation leaves me nowhere to stow the box (e.g., a basement, a closet) that would keep the trail of Feline Pine sawdust and clumping litter from getting all over my bathroom floor, my bed linens, etc. Bottom line is if you're in a confined space I highly recommend using clay litter with this product because you will never see a spec of litter on the floor. My cat took to this box right away."
4,Stainless Steel but cheaply put together.,"Nice steamer but you'll notice as you open it up - it bends where the ""petals"" join the base. It's soft, so it doesn't snap but I wonder if this will affect its longevity. Very stiff so not necessarily cheap but badly assembled. Okay for however long it will last. Considering its price, I'd think it would be better made."
2,Very Frustrating,"I'm surprised with the other reviews and 5 and 6 yr olds loving this. I myself got frustrated with it, not because it's difficult to do but I think it's ridiculous how many times and how often you have to change the yarn. I thought it would be rainbow yarn where she can just start threading and keep going. Nope. Each color has it's own thread and you have to thread the needle, then you go through 4 holes and have to change the color, go through 4 holes and change the color, go through 2 holes and change the color, etc. You spend more time changing the yarn color than actually doing the needlecraft. We were very disappointed."
3,Alex Toy Simply Needlepoints Kits,My eight year old daughter enjoyed the kit and I recommend it to others as a way to start off.
3,makes me rather sad,"I don't know how many people know this, but Pilot Speed was formerly known as Pilate. They had to change their name in order to sell/play their music in the US. This disc is a crude compilation put out by their record company, combining their work from two separate albums, ""Caught by the Window"" and ""Sell Control for Life's Speed"", which were originally released in Canada under Pilate. Living in Detroit, it makes it easy for me to hear up and coming Canadian bands. I would recommend them to anyone and everyone, but what I totally disapprove of is the way they went about releasing it. Majority of the album are made up of tracks from ""Sell Control for Life's Speed"", missing major tracks from ""Caught in the Window"", such as Endgame, Mercy, Melt Into the Walls, and Collide. If you like this disc, check out their other two albums. I'm sure you'll have to pay an Import rate on the disc if you don't have access to Canada, but it will be well worth it."
2,Kindle version is lousy,"I love old Hollywood and was anxious to read this, but was sorely disappointed by this fiasco. This book is a rehash of scandals that have been written about before. There was nothing new in this book except some recipes inserted at the end of chapters.My biggest complaint was the very poor editing of the Kindle edition. There were numerous, glaring typographical errors. The editing was overlooked; was someone in a hurry to get the Kindle version posted on Amazon? In 2 instances, a sentence was written twice at the beginning of a paragraph. In another example, a Q was inserted instead of a 9. Small and capital letters were interspersed into titles. And, how do you spell ""Diane?"" Does anyone at Amazon know how to use Spell Check?If you want to read this book, save some money and get it at the library."
2,In a nutshell...literally,"Although this book provides some information about Sedona, it simply touches upon each of the subjects without giving you anything tangible to use while you're there. Each of the sections leaves you craving more, which leaves me thinking that I would have been better of buying the more expensive, yet more informative and comprehensive books that are on Amazon."
4,Feels more like a dirty south record,Midwikid's debut is not that bad. I found it in some cheap $$$ pile and picked it up just because i knew Kay Gee was the producer behind it. Well it does not really disapoint. It is a pretty good album. Some good bass to ride to and some hardcore gangsta tracks. I am more into underground stuff like anticon and def jux etc. but it is much better than alot of the mainstream (nelly & the tics) midwest stuff. Their beats are all provided by somebody named Ratid X and they are pretty smooth and have a dirty south feel kinda. It starts out with some hard hiting beats but it mellows out and is pretty sick. Definitly some head nodding beats here. If you get this you will be gettin something wikid.
4,"Don't read the Hong Kong review, gives away plot items","If you want to spoil stuff for us, at least give us a heads up you jerk. Giving 4 stars because that's the average (and I have to give something), haven't yet read this, I was trying to read reviews and got mad at this guy."
5,Nobody better than Hap Palmer!,"Using this CD with preschoolers is just about the best way I know to engage them in musical activities, following directions, and learning basic concepts. What fun!"
2,Shoot me in the head,"I understand that this music may have sentimental value to those out there that grew up on it, but for those of us that didn't, it's excruciating. My 18 month old son seems to like it and I like the values and lessons that Palmer conveys, so I didn't give this 1 star. Palmer sounds like he is stoned out of his mind and the songs are slow and repetitive. When a kid discovers music that he/she likes, they want to listen over and over and over again. The best children's music should be at least minimally palatable to parents. This is not, unless the parent has a sentimental attachment."
4,"If nothing else, it's worth it for the artwork.","Circus of Pain is a collaboration between members of Swamp Terrorists and Meathead with a little assistance from Templebeat. It is a good showcase of these bands' talents, with funky basslines, hard guitar riffs, and danceable industrial/hip hop beats. Aside from the several versions of ""Remove My Skin"" (a Circus of Pain original, I believe), there are ""covers"" of the collaborators' other bands' songs, such as Swamp Terrorists ""Right Here"" and Meathead's ""Dick Smoker"" (which Swamp Terrorists also cover on their ""Killer"" album). You should get this if you're into any of the bands involved or if you like KMFDM (who Swamp Terrorists have often been compared to)."
4,"Great Fan, But Could Use Some Improvement","I received this fan as a Christmas gift 2-3 years ago and it's perfect for my room and keeping my cool at night! Very strong and I like being able to set a timer so I'm cool when I go to bed but not freezing when I wake up in the morning. I have this fan running A LOT, so it has gotten some good use out of it, but eventually a lot of dust builds up inside, which stalls the fan from running properly. It still works, but can be a little funny at times."
4,RUNS & RUNS & RUNS,"I bought my fan in 2005 for my ridiculously tiny windowless office. This fan is on Monday-Friday 9 to 5. Admittedly it does get very dusty. I use compressed air to blow it out from time to time. But all told - that fan has run for 6 1/2 years. its powerful, its compact and i would not be able to tolerate this office without it. the problem began a few weeks ago - it doesn't want to ocillate anymore. It still runs but i don't like having a fan blow right on me so i like the ocillation feature. I am looking to replace it but NOT at $80. Brookstone has another mini max for $50. Since i was so successful with my first mini max i think i will buy another."
3,"Cool to listen to at first, but it has been done before","I doubt anyone has heard of ""Black Rain."" A friend of mine let me listen to some of it and it is very cool. The music is ambient and techno fused together. Some tracks are very eerie and slow-paced like ""Xerfem."" Others are very fast paced techno dance tunes like ""Night Island 2"" or ""Train Stop."" Some of the tracks are very well done, its just that most of this stuff I've heard before. If you have been to a dance club then you've heard this CD basically. That's why I give it 3 stars: It's very interesting and intruiging music, it has just been done before. Still, if you have gotten every techno/ambient CD out there and you can't get enough, then consider picking this up."
2,Better available,"This compass handles very poorly compared to other manufacturers. The pin for the lid is cheap and the hing will likely break. The card (actual compass part that spins) wobbles a lot so it's difficult to get an exact bearing. It is like the oil in the compass is very thin. Also, the direction line lid spins easily, making it possible to take a bad reading. Ironically, this is the Silva weakness as well.If you need an inexpensive engineer style compass, consider the Silva. For a two more dollars, you get an aluminum case, a hinge that won't break and a card that doesn't wobble with the slightest hand movement."
4,Not a bad King film!,"I thought the opening climax of this movie was the scarest part.The Diner scene.Could this movie happen?I say not.Think about it.The kids kill off all the adults in the town.5 years passed,how come some of the kids did'nt age in that time?And I think Credit Card companies would be wondering why no one in Gatlin is paying there Credit Card Bills?And how about TAX Bills!The IRS would be coming to town!You just cant wipe a town off the face of the earth with out any one noticing.Well this was a good movie and a lot better then those terrible sequels this movie spawned.Who was ""He who walks behind the rows""? The Devil a demon?They never did say who it was.If you ask me,I think they should de a Children of the Corn prequel about ""He Who Walks Behind the Row""?"
3,Mixed up review...,"Everyone babbled to me about how scary it is, I must see it! Being a person who likes the genre, I saw it for 9.99 on DVD so I bought it. It is scary, but it is so different, the movie is clouded...that feeling you get like in Texas chain saw massacre...like, what the hell just happened? I liked it, however, but it was a tadd ahead of my memory. I like that the ending was 'happier' then the book's everyone dies ending. See it if you like scifi and low budget horror/cult movies. Not for everyone, but to me, it was fairly enjoyable. Classic? Maybe to some, but to me it was just a movie that uses religion and satin and weird stuff to make a scary ...movie...not classic, just pretty good."
1,So Unbelieveably Bad,"This is corny as hell. Pardon the pun. Who the hell could call this a great, scary horror film and still keep a straight face when they call themselves horror fans?. This is stomach churning drivel. So god awful is it, that you just wonder what Stephen King thought when he saw this monstrosity. The acting is of high disgust caliber. The effects and make-up are cheesy and half cocked. The score was lame and the kids were terrible. One of the worst of all time. If you think this is great, you must be one of the brainwashed kids. This film should never of been made."
2,Another King story trashed,"This film actually begins quite well, although the little kid narrating it kind of made it lose the creepy feeling you had in the opening credits. The movie is actually fairly entertaining until after our two main characers enter the house of our youthful narrator and his sister. Up until this sour turn in events, it's a fairly noble adaption. And then the story is wrecked, from the, al I can think of is: ""toned down"" ending, tothe lame interpretation of ""He who walks Behind The rows"". Why do screenplay writers feel they must always change the master of horror's story around? Everytime they do it trashes what could've been a promising film. I've seen it in Dreamcatcher and The Tommyknockers, although this sucked already anyway. It also brings to mind: Why did they feel inclined to make a sequel? Hollywood sickens me sometimes."
1,Silly attempt at horror,"Being a fan of Stephen King's works, I was willing to give this movie a try. I was severely letdown. This ranks as one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen.The story begins as all the kids in the town of Gatlin murder all the adults. Then two adults stumble across the town and soon find themselves stalked by the sickle-toting children.I found the movie impossible to be believe. This movie is just not scary. I can't seem to figure how Linda Hamilton got through this movie with a straight face.I read in Stephen King's biography that Stephen King declared this one of the worst movies ever made.Enough said."
3,sterling silver baby brat,Item was a bit smaller than the others I have. Wish there were some measurements to go by when ordering.
2,Not What I was looking For...,"I would not say this book is terrible-there is alot of good stuff in the last few chapters to educate all-I was just a little disappointed in what seemed to me the long drawn out story of Ms. Ross. I applaud her for her courage to reach out to those in need and share her experiences but, I think less of her story would have gotten the point across.Maybe someone who is in a situation similar to hers would find some comfort here.There is alot of information in the later chapters for therapists who are unfamiliar with suicide grief to benefit from and would greatly help those in need with such."
4,Classic,"Aside from the poetry, which just doesn't do it for me in this context, this book is a classic must read for anyone (male or female) interested in or struggling with manhood or masculinity in general."
5,A lexicon for the American Male experience...,"Mr. Bly, much maligned but terribly wise, outlines the pitfalls of the young man with expert insight. The most profound point that Mr. Bly makes is that the maturing process is not like puberty: it is not eventual but volitional. As emerging warriors, young men must make decisions that are painful in the short term in order to grow. The decision to recconnect with older men has made all the difference in my life. I have Mr. Bly to thank because I may never have come to it on my own."
4,Iron John helps men identify the voids in their reality,"I am writing this 1/2 way through the book, but so far I am impressed with Bly's ability to tie the meaning behind ancient fairy tales and traditions which bound men and boys together with the social ills that result today from the lack of these ties. I found the book really struck a resounding chord for me, perhaps moreso because I was raised by my mother and grandmother in a fatherless household until the age of ten. The book helped me understand some things about myself that I had not realized and led to some productive self-reflection."
5,the best mouse I ever had so far,"very good mouse and not just for gaming.I have 1920x1080 screen res. so precision of that mouse is really matter.If you use less then 1024x768 res you might not see any difference, but if you have more then you will see that difference right a way."
3,Buggy drivers need work,"The hardware seems great, but the drivers are buggy. For example, in Outlook, scrolling with the mouse wheel doesn't work properly. Cruise scroll doesn't work on my 2nd monitor. I didn't have this problem with the MX510. Coming from the MX510, I'm a little disappointed because I was expecting more. If they can get the bugs out then it would be a 4 or 5 star mouse."
4,Talk about overkill,"This is a great expensive mouse, the whole ""adding weight"" feature is an interesting but useless feature for me but cool none the less. The mouse has been 100% accurate since the time of purchase (almost a year now). This mouse is truly overkill though, just find a cheaper laser guided mouse if you can or if it even exists. Or just buy this."
2,Not Worth the Money,"I bought the mouse and had high expectations. However, I did not think its worth $30 more than a standard mouse. Well, I would not try to buy a gamer mouse again."
2,bad mouse,I bought this mouse to complete my sweet gaming setup only to find it was 2 steps back. The mouse is way to bulky and side buttons to clucky
4,An appreciated present,"A sweet friend has complimented me on using this fragrance, which I have enjoyed for a number of years. I feel that it's a good value for the price. I bought this item as a gift for her and she has used and enjoyed it."
2,no more bop,"Being a Mark Fan for 30 years, I'm sorry to say I hate this album. You must be in suicide mood to like this kind of stuff.Why want anyone to take a poem on music or spoken words?"
2,Was assigned this book from our Criminal Law Professor,"I read it, it made somewhat sense but the problem was that it did not have any cases. The good thing was, my professor taught half of the course using this book..."
3,"Great information, but buy the author's other book first","The Beauty Bible is meant as a companion volume to Paula Bogoun's Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me, and it does contain some unique information not found in Don't Go..., including advice on overall body care and tips on makeup application. However, the most helpful sections of this book--eg, instructions for blemish/acne treatment, inside information about product ingredients, etc.--are covered more succinctly and clearly in Begoun's other work, which also includes a ton of useful information on specific skin care and makeup products. I recommend that you first purchase Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me, and if you then require additional information, consider buying this book."
3,Not what I thought,I thought the book would reveal what products to purchase. No mention at all. Was disappointed
2,Far Below Lonely Planet's Regular Standards,"I lost count of the number of errors in this book. They printed the wrong dates for Carnaval Samba Parades, the prices are in USD rather than in local currency - all wrong by an average 30%, as well. Hotels and restaurants are listed that closed long before the January 2002 publication date, and it's obvious that they haven't been to Brasilia in years - citing it as `treeless` - which I`m sure it was twenty years ago, but not today.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend a better Brazil guide because I don't have any experience with any others, but I enjoyed ceremoniously burning this book when I left Brazil.The most disappointing is that other Lonely Planet Guidebooks (I have used 5 other ones) far exceed the standards that this one set."
4,Solid and high quality,Bought this for my grandson. The construction is solid and it feels like a good quality product. I would recommend.
2,Irritating... But it works.,"I've owned a few Brunton Compasses. Why ""a few?"" I volunteer for a local S.A.R. organization. Over the years I have discovered that ALL of their liquid filled compasses WILL develop an air bubble in a short period of time. Even my 8099 has one. Sure, in the owners manual, they say that if a bubble develops it does not effect the accuracy and it is easily removed... Only to reappear (they don't mention) after about an hour or so. I would stick with a decent Silva. Rare to have any problems with the ones I've owned."
4,nice backup compass,"I am a really big fan of backup equipment and from multiple manufacturers when it is critical. There are times when I have been doing patrols in deep woods of Europe where I could not get a good GPS signal. That means that you really have to rely on your compass. I have always feared losing a critical piece of equipment. This compass is not fancy but it stays dry and holds up to weapon recoils and shocks pretty well. If I lose my standard issue compass, then this is my plan B."
4,One of the loudest and grossest albums of all time,I like this album but it just sort of grosses me out to read the lyrics.Its better to just ignore them and listen to the guttural roar of the singer which is unintelligible if you dont have the lyric sheets and of course the super fast guitar leads and the mega heavy rythm section.Maybe Im a wuss not to look at the lyric sheets but I dont care.I dont like to have stuff like that stuck in my head.The speed and heaviness of the music of itself is great though.I recommend this to people who like heavy music but not for those who get easily sickened.Oh yeah and Hammer Smashed Face was featured in Ace Ventura Pet Detective one of my favorite movies.
4,"Any track on ""Tomb"" is ready for the next ""Now"" compilation","Ok first off, the riffing on this disc is pretty, forget the about gore soaked lyrics and the menacingly growling vocals for a minute and you should be able to appreciate some of the drum and guitar precision that actually makes this album worth listening to if not just for the cover alone. Yes its highly disturbing, fun, campy, over the top. Do you see where I am going with this? Be the person who has at least one Cannibal Corpse cd in the collection, especially if you don't even listen to heavy music or you aren't into death metal. It could be that novelty cd you've been searching for."
1,Are You Joking Me????,"First off I would prefer to give this c.d. no stars at all, since that's not an option, I had to settle for one. As a woman I am appauled at the graffic topics disscussed on this c.d. I give props to all the guys who had enough balls to say that it is a disgusting display of pure mental sickness. I find this album extremely offending, which is hard to do. I am not offended by many things. This entire album displays an extreme distaste and lack of deep meaningful, relevant subjects to sing about. Frankly, I believe it shows a huge level of immaturity, get your priorities straight. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE this type of music, but spend your money on something more worth it. Perhaps, spineshank, machine head, pantera or sepultura. So do yourself a favor and get a life, or maybe a real hobby. Let's get real here people. Where's the good metal at?"
1,AGGGHH!,"Now I'm not one of those hyper conservative people who thinks music influences people, but that cover art is just plain fricken disgusting, I mean, seriously, it's almost as bad as the music.The music sucks. Poser gore crap. Listen to Death and Obituary for death metal instead."
5,Very enjoyable,"Get them, get them all. Genealogy and murder - hmm, who would have thought it, but wait, I know people who seem to care about their ancestors like some of the characters in this book. I can seem some of them at least thinking of murder if their lineage is ridiculed. Again, these sixty something sisters and their kin are a hoot and a half. Read and enjoy."
3,Pleasant read,"It wasn't a ""can't put it down"" book, but it was a pleasant read with an unexpected twist at the end.It did have some laugh out loud sections, but I found some sections to be boring."
5,AWESOME Beanbag!!,"I bought this beanbag for my 3 year old, and we ABSOLUTELY love it! It is so soft and very durable. My daughter jumps on it constantly and it's still just like new! She also loves to sit in it to watch TV and play because it's so soft and comfy. TERRIFIC PRODUCT!"
2,The text didn't adequately answer the questions outlined in the book,The text didn't adequately answer the questions outlined in the book. I was hoping to be able to use this with teenagers who are questioning God's existence
1,inaccessible to most,"nothing records wasn't ""scared"" of this album. it left trent reznor's hands bearing a Post-It note saying ""no commercial potential."" yes, of course a few people might like it, but this album had no future of securing any serious following or profits for that matter. concept albums hardly ever see a profit. despite these facts, it's just not a good album. the content is cliche."
4,Enjoy the Journey,"As a small town family doctor I sometimes get the feeling that 'adolescence' and 'tragedy' are linked words. Annette Smith offers a hopeful and enjoyable antidote to the angst that, perhaps not unjustly, grips many parents wishing the best for their daughters in an age so often unfriendly and even exploitive of their particular vunerabilities. Approaching her subject with the hands of an experienced nurse, the voice of an experienced mother, the heart of a pastor, and the eye of a writer she offers what I would like to prescribe to my patients parenting teen girls - practical advice on how to enjoy the relationship of focused, yet not overbearing, intentional parenting. Not another 'parent guilt' book but rather a timely and reassuring answer to the ""what now?"" raised by teen culture analyses like 'Reviving Ophelia'."
5,"Great Stroller, Highly Recommend","My family went to Disneyworld and got a chance to see all the different double strollers out there. This stroller caught our eye, we had an old one and were looking to replace it. We don't care for the side by side because it limits walking in stores and through isles. We settled on the Graco Quatro. It has plenty of cup and snack holders, storage space, a five point harness (for those Houdini children) and ergonomic handle bars. It handles very well. We have gotten a lot of compliments on it. The only down side is the attached bar for a car seat in the front; your car seat may not lock into the bar, so we just leave the cup and snack holder in place and lay the infant in the back seat."
5,"True, touching and comic!","The Sterile Cuckoo is a real gem... I bought this book less than a year ago and I've already read it 3 times. Not only is Pookie Adams believable, she's true! She's pathetic and witty, exuberant and the essence of youth. She's not terribly beautiful and not devastatingly smart, but she's unique. This is the autobiography of a college romance, and utterly fabulous"
3,Point of view,"I found the Sterile Cuckoo very interesting novel where you can see al kinds of characters and maybe you can identify yourself with one of them. Pookie and Jerry are full of magic they way of acting denotes their sensibility toward life and how fragile they are. I like the book, but I enjoyed more after I saw the movie, which I recommended to anyone."
5,"The majestic and soulful ""El Conde"".","The late great sonero Pete ""Conde"" Rodriguez was Johnny Pacheco's lead singer for almost a decade before recording this Pacheco-produced solo debut...and what a strong album it was!!! Pete's powerful and ever-soulful vocals and inspired soneos (improvisations) are truly superb on the classics ""Los Compadres"", ""Blanca Paloma"", ""Un Toque Pa' Yambao"" and a classy remake of Beny More's ""El Conde Negro"". Buy (and enjoy!) this CD and you'll understand why Pete was regarded as Johnny Pacheco's all-time greatest singer."
1,THIS WAS A GIFT TO AN ARTISTS-,I PURCHASED THIS BOOK FOR A PERSON WHO IS AN ARTIST AND WAS GIFTED WITH THIS SINCE A CHILD..HE IS HAS A GREAT INTEREST IN THIS ERA OF FRENCH ARTISTS...HE WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THIS BOOK AND THE CONTENTS --SAID HE ALMOST READ THE ENTIRE BOOK IN TWO DAYS...IT DOES HAVE NICE PHOTOS OF THIS ARTISTS WORKS AND HE WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE BOOK..IT ARRIVED IN PERFECT CONDITION AND IN A TIMELY MANNER...VERY HAPPY WITH EVERYTHING I HAVE ORDERED THRU AMAZON..THANK YOU... CHAR PS..MY RATING IS AS MANY STARS YOU CAN GIVE...VERY VERY HAPPY WITH YOUR SHIPPING AND COST AND NEVER HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE WITH AMAZON..
2,Didn't work,Tried and tried this stuff but the dogs just won't go 'there'.They didn't seem to like the smell and stay away from it!
1,It does not work at all.,This product is a wasre of money . It doesn't work at all as a matter of fact we feel that it does just the opposite of what it is supposed to do.
2,She sniffs it and then walks away,"Our puppy thinks this is an interesting smell and all, but it does not encourage her to use the bathroom there. We bought this with an indoor fake grass mat thing, and she is too afraid of both of them to use it (she was originally trained to use only outdoors). Oh well! Worth a try."
3,Puppy Spray,"This product just didn't work for us with our Yorkie. I am not saying it isn't a great product, I think we just have an overly stubborn breed."
2,Did not work for my dog,I have a 8lb. mini dachshund and I have been trying to train him to be an inside dog and I have not noticed any improvement from this product.
5,HELL-o,"Gwar's humble begininngs. Yeah so the quality sucks, but the songs rock. ""Americanized"" is probably the best song on the album but also check out ""Je M'Applle J. Cousteau"" and ""Gwar Theme"". Jizmak was not in the band yet so the drum work is not his but still, Oderus is there Beefcake, Balzak, Flattus and even Teckno is there. Check it out if you don't own it yet, you won't be dissapointed."
5,Enjoyable Experience,I have been very satisfied with this item!! I would recommend this CD to every Pre-K and Kindergarten Teacher! Great way to teach kids!
1,Really poor,"Ordered two of these, one for home shop and one for cabin on the river. Does not improve reception any at all for local am station 15 miles away and at much lower elevation with no rise in elevation between. The antenna is located in a window elevated 6 feet from the floor level in a wood frame shingle roof building with nothing which would cause interference nearby. Waste of money.Terk Technology AM/FM+ Radio Antenna"
5,Works like a charm,"Installed on an older surround sound receiver I had to run some outdoor speakers by my pool (I had lost original FM antenna). Receiver is in the middle of my house on the bottom floor, and I can pick up all the stations I wanted. Works like a charm!"
1,Better Without It.,"Well, not too much to say about this product other than the radio sounded better, with less static, without the unit compared to with it connected. I returned it the next day.I live in the metro area where most FM radio stations come in very well, but a couple that I like can have some static from time to time. So, I opted for this unit as a relatively cheap way to improve radio reception. Unfortunately, that was not the case at all. Reception was worse across the board with this unit compared to the simple wire provided by my receiver manufacturer (Sony). I think connecting this unit introduces more possibilities for signal interference with other audio components nearby that make it unsuitable to have anywhere near other audio components.Bottom line: I would avoid if you have other audio components that will interfere with this unit and/or don't what to run a long cable to position this unit in a suitable location."
2,one hunk of junk,"I'm sorry I cannot figure how it would work without a way to plug it into something? It doen't work with my Ghost Box, and I can't hook it up w/anything else either"
1,Nothing!,"The ""nothing"" refers to exactly what this product did for my AM/FM reception. It did, however, lighten my wallet by a few dollars."
2,Please take this book off my hands,"I didn't care for this book because the Dr. promotes conventional medications.Want a book on natural healing along with herbal remedies check out ""Gentle Healing for Baby and Child"" by Andres Candee."
2,Cannot be returned and bad packaging,"This is a functional compass but I realized it's too small for my taste. I wanted to return it to get a bigger one and realized I cannot, so please read all the print. Also, very bad packaging. I received it in a very big box, all smashed up, with crunched up paper inside and no invoice. Beware!"
3,I have used this book as a Math and Physics tutor,"This precalculus text book is used by many school districts in both Northern and Central New Jersey for those students in both regular and honors precalculus. I know this because I am a part time math (precalculus, AP calculus) and physics (high school and college) tutor in the Nothern and Central New Jersey area, and have been for many year. My website is[...]. I feel the book does an adequate job providing examples and enough theoretical explanations so the astute student can almost self-teach. However, if the student is not strong in math, the explanations will be beyond such a student. The book does a very good job in providing enought examples, and the assignment sections as the back of each section are well thought out in terms of gradually building in complexity. The presentation (font, layout, graphs, etc.) of the book is very good. I do recommend this text (have a copy at home), but I have seen better."
5,nice,love this fragrance and also gor body sray to go along with this product which was a very nice choice for my very special occasions
4,Needs to be heard,"A very big problem we have in this country is intellectual laziness amongst the masses. People hear whats on the 7 o'clock news and accept it as truth and gospel. Most in this country are so comfortable with their lives they think nothing else really matters and nothing can change it.WELL WAKE UP! David Horowitz's book ""Uncivil Wars"" is at the top of my list of books that people must read in order to emerge from the intellectual slumber. It will wake the common observer to the tyranny and fascism existing in our beloved country's most important institutions.For those already ""awakened"" the anti-reperations argument is so often muddled out by the cries of racism that its sickening. This book will provide the most thought out and concise arguments against reparations.A MUST READ"
1,Zionist garbage,"I wonder if David Horowitz would agree that since reparations should not be made for slavery, Israel should be returned to Palestinians as reparations for enslaving the state of Palestine. ""Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery"" is a load of Zionist garbage."
5,Sharp - Sounds Good To Me,"This System Sounds Good To Me - Clear Crisp & Plenty of Bass. Plays Everything You Have - MP3's CD's CD R's Cd RW's, Cassette's. Has 5 Disc Space for great random play. We even hooked up the Xbox. 440 Watts. Satisfied Customer!"
2,Worked very well before it went belly up.,"This was a great board for almost 2 years and then suddenly one day my monitor goes blank and my hard drive light comes on and stays on. So I reset it but its just blank - nothing. After a complete check up and tests, the motherboard was sort of dead and definately unusable.I know Asus makes great products and this is the FIRST TIME I have been let down by one of their items and I simply think the board just went bad. I would not buy this particular board again though."
5,"Buy this DVD, you won't be sorry...","You may end up crying-laughing, but is there any shame in that? This is one of the greatest character-portrait documentaries ever made, and it's also one of the funniest!"
4,Almost Brilliant,"First Off, if u liked ""Is This Thing Loaded"" you need to get this cd....It's very simalar except the all around production is greatly improved. The Vocals are very addictive and the riffs prodominatly in the chorus' of every song are extremely catchy...There 1st single from the album ...For Member Only is a great song to start the cd off with because of the steady flow of the whole song. Songs Like ""Accident Underwater, Pornographer's Daughter, American Living, and Between Hornes and Halos"" really make this a 100% enjoyable disk to listen to...kudos for Northstar for the vast improvement from ITTL.."
5,Great Drum Set,"Bought the GP55 Child Size Junior Drum set based off the reviews on Amazon.... The drumb set is great, my 5 year old boy is having a blast with them. My wife and I even get on them sometimes and have fun trying to put some beats together.We are not musicians but my son had been asking for a set of drums for some time, we did not want to spend money on something that would fall apart after playing them but couldn't justify paying a huge amount of money for something that was going to be a toy for my son. This drum set has lived up to all the reviews. They are tough, well quality built and a great starter set for kids.Note: I did receive the instructions for the 3 pc. set instead of the 5 pc. set but even though i've never put drums together, it was easy to figure out using the 3pc. set instructions."
5,You beed this in your library,"Learning to value yourself, learning to respect yourself, learnng to believe in yourself, and above all learning to love yourself you will find this and so much more in this amazing book."
4,Valuable insights and ideas,"Kris has a gift for finding undiscovered spiritual truth and bringing it to light. This book will challenge you and cause you to think and grow in your understanding of what it means to be a child of God. His writing style isn't the most polished, but he gets the message across anyway. Definitely worth the time to read. You'll probably want to read it more than once."
5,Soar Into Your Destiny as a World Changer!,"As children of the King, we are invited to live as Princes and Princesses in God's Kingdom! If you have any struggles with self-worth and your purpose for being alive, this book is a MUST read! Kris Vallotton masterfully weaves in the truth of God's word along with his own life experiences that ultimately led him to believe who God says He is! The Holy Spirit used this book to convince me even more that I am a loved and valued child of God with a limitless destiny in Him!"
5,An eye-opening book,"I am so blessed by Kris Vallotton and his heart. It is amazing to read about a man who connects so intimately with Jesus. His books will inspire you to believe in who God made you to be. To forgive others, to love others, and learn about God's heart for you along the way. I am so thankful for him!"
1,Icky!,"Like the previous poster mentioned, these are glorified pantyliners. They don't hold urine very well at all. I use regular nighttime maxis for my doggie diapers now, and they work perfectly and keep the urine from soaking through to the diaper.Save your money and spend it on normal overnight maxis."
4,"Could use a headphone jack, but otherwise excellent.","This is an excellent sounding, easy to use minidisc unit. The only obvious feature I can think of that it's missing is a headphone jack. I bought mine through Amazon and it was the best price around with free (and fast) shipping."
4,great buy for the money,"this was a great buy for the money, the product came a little early which was a plus but the one down side was after one week the player broke and i had to send it back but as long as you save your receipt everything is good! i sent it back"" i had to pay for shipping "" and it was back in about 15 days and is working great so far!"
4,Very nice basic MD player/recorder.,This MD player has been a musical piece in my second system. I'd recommend it for a mid-level stereo setup.
5,One of Niven's Best - The Origin of Known Space!,"For those who love Niven's work, this may the his best. It continues to have the strongest effect on me after many re-readings."
5,A science-fiction classic!,"A densely-packed novel that combines theory on evolution and the human life cycle with hard science, politics, action, prediction, and one of the most interesting aliens ever devised"
3,"not Stewart's best, but not bad either","Airs Above the Ground is not quite as compelling in its descriptions and plot as The Gabriel Hounds, My Brother Michael, or This Rough Magic (my favourite); however, it is still a classic Stewart mystery/romance, even if the romance is quite evident from the start. Vanessa March is quite likable and the only Stewart heroine thus far to not have annoyed me just a little bit. My favourite element of the book is the friendship that develops between Vanessa and young Tim Lacy, who is trying to break away from a stifling household and forge a path for himself. As far as the descriptions of exotic locales go, trademark to Stewart, I enjoyed the chase scene through the castle. Airs Above the Ground didn't wow me and I found the ending a bit strange as it didn't feature Annalisa at all..., but all in all, a pleasent read."
5,Laugh out Loud! Probably her BEST book EVER! Re-read it yearly in spring!,"Breakup is a great reflection on life in general, although it is a wonderful portrait of Alaska, as well. Dana Stabenow's heroine, Kate, is balanced with her normal cadre of neighbors, relatives and friends. You would swear some of them are people you meet every day, which is why THIS book is a hilarious treasure that needs to be reread every spring."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"This is the well known Metal Blade re-mixes of ""Lightning To The Nations"". This is overly polished, clean sounding, has riffs chopped off, and has very little of the rawness and power of the original (LTTN). Also, don't buy the Metal Blade versions of LTTN. Either buy the vinyl, which was pressed in Germany or the blank-cover version. I hate to say this, but Metal Blade ruined a masterpeace. Anyway, find the High Vaultage version of LTTN and you will definitely be satisfied as it was mastered directly from the FIRST vinyl pressing. If you do not believe me, check out Metal Maniacs issue (Nov 98 I think..) and you will read more about it."
2,Adidas axion shoes,"I bought these for aerobics class, but they didn't feel comfortable to me. They feel heavy too. I just wear to work now."
1,"Flesh eating shoes, buyer beware","I bought these because I needed another pair of running shoes, to rotate with my fave Nikes. Well, I should have stayed with the Nikes. Comfy at first then they chewed the back of my right heel. Bad shoes, Bad. I agree with the previous reviewer who stated these things might be defective. I wore them for a couple hours, took them off my feet and threw them directly into the trash. Ouch"
4,Great Cushioning,I have not worn Adidas in a while and I think these shoes have made me a loyal adidas customer again. I use them for light jogging and aerobics. My feet have never felt better.
3,hit or miss,"John Lennon did not have the attention span for any other writing than songs. When a reviewer referred to an 8 page piece of his as a ""short piece"" Lennon said, ""To me, they are marathons. That's why I kill characters off, because I can't remember them."" Evidence of his lack of an attention span are in these pages. But a little trivia for you Americans: in England, ""spanner"" means ""wrench."" And, ""a spanner in the works,"" is equivalent to the American saying, ""a monkey wrench in the machinery."" So the title A SPANIARD IN THE WORKS is more of Lennon's clever word-play."
1,Very poor play back of my tapes,"Bought this due to positive feedback regarding playback ability. Made a mistake.Play back on this machine is extremely poor, have old JVC machines in garage and shop that use for play back and give excellent pictures with same tapes.Will send back and replace with JVC"
1,What a disappointment!!!,"We purchased this model after carefully checking out other brands. What a mistake! It browns the top of the bread unevenly while burning the bottom! There is no automatic turn-off if the door is opened and, like several other reviewers, we agree that it is poorly made, cheap construction. Don't buy it!"
4,Overall Good,I would have given 5 star but 2 of the cans were slightly open when they arrived so They turned bad. My dog likes it and it settles ok with hos stomch.
4,Learning Something New,"Counting Katie's Gifts is wonderful children's book. At the beginning, Katie is sad because her friend got a present for no reason. Her mother comforted her and told her that she has many gifts. Katie did not understand at first, but then her mother took her outside and showed her a bird in the tree. Katie didn't realize that the bird was a gift, but it was, from God. Then Katie was able to find many more neat gifts of nature that God gave us. I believe this is a valuable lesson for all children to learn."
4,Civil War in Lists,"If you like David Letterman's ten reasons, ten best, etc lists then you will love this book. It is filled with interesting information about the many lists about and concerning the Civil War."
2,Certain inaccuracies,"Flagel uses the term ""African Americans"" when in reality the term didn`t come into existence until latter 20th century. Please, if you`re writing about history, be historically accurate. Negroes and blacks is correct terminology."
2,A good concept with disappointing substance,"At first, I was intrigued by the title and the idea of using insights from history and science to formulate corporate strategy. However, disappointment set in already in the first chapter. It gave the impression that the whole strategic concept was based on a ""falsifiable strategic hypothesis"" with little room for imagination and creative thinking. The historic lessons appeared also to be scarce and somewhat academic. I ran out of incentive to complete reading the book. As a fellow McKinsey alumnus and a 'student of the arts', I had expected something better than that."
2,"The good, the bad, and the ugly....","The good: the massage function works fine, no problems with the performance, and the battery holds a good charge.The bad: how much money is saved in construction by using thecheapest foam padding imaginable?The ugly: the 'pebbled vinyl' material on the arms is already separating after six months. Maybe a cheaper material could have been found...but I doubt it.Overall good in theory, but very poor in execution. If some real quality were put into the product, it would rate potentially 5 stars. 'Til then,you've been warned....!"
3,rushed?,"I have to say I'd agree with whoever gave this album less than 3 stars. All the songs here are the same,, I could not tell a difference between 1st and 10th but they are however in between melodic and heavy but not as heavy as early metallica. All of the members are very skilled musicians and can come up with interesting sounds here and there. Besides that,there's really nothing I can point my finger at could be outstanding in any way. This leads me to say that Draconial Times is better than Icon for few reasons. Get it and you'll find out why."
2,Adequate,"I am not excited about these glasses. It was not clear from the description that it was a C5 version, meaning not only the out dated logo but the outdated color as well. And the styling was not what I expected in person. I carry these in the car as a back up pair, but wear them very little."
5,Fantastic movie,"It is one of the best movies I've ever seen. All actors are real great, but the best are David Bowie and the unbelievable Takeshi Kitano who acts as the Yakuza-Boss in Johnny Mnemonic, every movie with Kitano is real great, also his japanese movies. Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence is better than River Kwai and it is more interesting to see the characters, who are really terrrific, than to see the typical american war-heroes in River Kwai. Im Mr.Lawrence wins no one a battle against the other, the prisoners only want to survive, they do not want to fight against anyone, only Bowie is a little bit rebellish."
3,"Chekhov, Hollywood Style","A not uninteresting adaptation of Chekhov's ""The Shooting Party,"" with the requisite 1940s Hollywoodization (have peasants ever looked so clean?). One of Douglas Sirk's earliest Hollywood efforts. Begins in 1919, two years after the Russian Revolution, but takes place, via flashback, in 1912, five years before the Revolution, so we get to see an example of a profligate Russian nobleman (a strangely cast Edward Everett Horton). Sanders is very good as the judge whose obsession with a beautiful peasant woman (Darnell) eventually ruins his life. Darnell is certainly sultry and seductive, but there's nothing peasant about her in her early scenes. (Just as a nit-picking point of information: Darnell's name could not have been Olga Kuzminichna; it would have to have been Olga Kuzminovna - just the way patronymics/middle names are formed in Russian.) Certainly worth a look, especially for those who enjoy films from the 1940s."
1,Just horrible,"I heard what a popular game Halo is and was looking forward to the DVD, thinking it would be on the line of GI Joe or the Justice League. Boy was I WRONG. The animations is really basic, at first even watercolor like. The story is told more in pictures than in actual animation. I did not realize that this was several short stories (around 10 min each) and not a continuing story. I stopped watching after DUEL, then I decided to give it another try and the watercolors went to Japanese animation type, but still very basic. The stories were as basic as the animation and I never did finish the whole DVD. I got it on sale for $2 and feel I wasted my money. Maybe hard core fans will get something out of this, for everyone else I say skip it."
2,Not sure what people are watching,"I think the sheer newness of this film has people blinded to the fact that it was not that good. I am fantasy and Manga artist and I am more than in agreement with artistic license, but there was so much of that in this flick that it took away what could have been decent stories. The visuals where at times confusing and totally unnecessary. It was like it was done by students who were allowed to spread their wings with colors and abstract shapes. This is somewhat typical of true Japanese Manga. Just too darn much. If they focused on what the game truly portrays this would have been much better.If you play the game religiously you will be a bit disappointed in this looooong awaited movie."
4,Really Cool!,"This was a Christmas present for my dad. He has watched it a few times and thinks it is awesome! I watched it once too and I think it's pretty cool! However, I will say this: if you are not a fan of the Halo video game series, then you might want to play those first. But, it is a standalone collection of animated films and it should be enjoyable, regardless!"
2,"Potential, but falls short.","Babysitter, Homecoming, Prototype, and both origins were my favorites out of all of them. While Halo Legends features amazing animation from the start (except for the duel), the overall feeling that this gives me is that this was pretty much a cash in. Rather than have a bunch and mix of different directors with different styles they might have been safer choosing one style and director. Having read all the books when I finished watching this it made me think that the directors didn't have a feel for the games or the previous adventures and set out to do their own thing. The package had good animation but was just too corny and over the top. I skipped the duel and odd one out because as a fan of Halo I couldn't stand for how lame this was. If they ever attempt another try at this they need to make it a feature length film with a good plot, they should also keep to the japanese anime style used in prototype, babysitter and homecoming."
2,No Halo here,If you are a Halo fan this is probably is a good DVD but if you are looking for a good movie about warriors in suits try Bubblegum Crisis.I really think the animation could have been better. I just got through watching 9 on Blu-ray that was a much better Blu-ray animation.
2,Not for me.,I've never played the Halo series of games. If I had I might have enjoyed this movie. I prefer sci-fi over all other movies and books but this one isn't for me.
1,Lame,"I have nothing more to say other than an American franchise should have stayed American. An anime spin on the Halo universe is totally lame and detracts from the epic feel that is Halo. What a waste. Though the Origins portion was ok, everything else,.... well I will not get my time back."
4,Really cool movie!,"Awesome, loved this movie! The different style are incredible, and it looks like this movie had a huge budget, very slick. I didn't care for the american produced segments as much, but loved all the rest. the japanese segmnts were weirder than I thought, and it doesn't go with all the canon of Halo.I wasn't sure how this ties into ODST. Also, is this tying directly into the Halo prequel somehow, coming out in a few months? It was a bit confusing. And some of it goes against older Halo ideas, but all in all, I loved it!!But all in all, amazing. Two great animes in one week - Halo and Dante's Inferno! If only the rest of the months had this much cool stuff out!"
1,"Poor quality, will never buy one again.",This has got to be the worst remote control I've ever owned. I've gone throgh 5 in the last three years. I've experienced everything from a single button quitting to the entire remote failing. Absolutely horrible quality.
1,Don't waste your $$,"After a couple of nights of use the pad was all crinkled and wouldn't stay in place and was very uncomfortable. My son would move and it would send off a false alarm. For the amount of money you spend on this product you would think they would include more than just 2 sensors. One gets wet in the middle of the night you have to replace it with the second, hoping by the next evening the sensors are dry enough to use again. It has not stopped the bed wetting."
1,the same pointless music,"You know, I actually try to sit down and listen to this music. I try to find something that is good about this album. Interminable instruments banging and slamming all at once without stopping, a singer who groans. I've tried to find something good with this album, but like before, Cannibal Corpse is a really stupid band... if you even want to call them a band. If you want REAL death metal, get morbid angel or In Flames.... Hmm... should I even rate this album 1 star???"
1,ridiculous,"Unlike wine, this band gets worst and worst with passing time. THis Cd has no innovation at all."
2,I'm sorry this band scared you,"A music fan from Spring, TX United States was home crying last night because of this CD. These guys are sick. They describe in painful detail of a family being murdered and making love with dead corpses. Musically, it's okay, and lyrically it's ridiculous, but they are so over the top gory. These guys need to get a life. Not the heaviest or anything of that short, but they are tied with Pig Destroyer and Agorophobic Nosebleed for sickest bands in the world."
1,All I can say is Pathetic,"Wow,people call this music?Here is a review broken down:Musically-The guitar and drum rythym slightly changes every few songs.Lyrically-Well the lyrics never change just disturbing and always about gore.Though you cant understand anything coming out of his mouth,if you get to reading lyrics you find it extremely sick.I think death metal as a whole is distgusting,but this is pathetic.So if you like people beating the hell out the drums(every song),same old guitar notes,and the vocalist screaming at the top of his lungs every track then this is the group for you.Why I give it 1 star or any stars at all,cuz it got my attention with the grotesque cover and name,so i'll give em' that."
4,Very basic beats but fun!,As the title implies it is a beginners book. I felt it could have covered a little bit more but again there was no false advertising when it states beginner level. (Which is definately where I was when I bought it).
3,Divorce Reading,My divorce has been and continues to be a very difficult personal struggle. This book really didn't provide much help. Maybe if I re-read it in a couple of months.
5,"I don't like it, I love it!","Yes, maybe the vocals aren't perfect, but the album has soul, feeling and a great sound. Try to hear it on the Gloria Reuben website."
2,the hidden persuaders,The intentions of the author can be judged well enough. But the bottomline is that the book no longer belongs to the present time and generation. It is sad but true that this insightful writing needs a relook in present context.
4,Time Warp to the 50's,"If you have an interest in what it was like to be in 1950's America, this book is like a time travel excursion taking you there. It's very dated, but an interesting look into life in that time, very much like being there. If you know a little about the 50's, this rounds out a lot of what you think you know. I'm just old enough to have missed the 50's (born 1962) but still recall much of the effects of those years on society. Growing up in Maine, it took awhile for the 50's to actually leave. Much of what I remember as a child relates to that era. If that's you too - you'll enjoy this quick, easy read."
4,GROOVY COMEDY! WHERE'S DVD??,"I WANT A DVD OF THIS!! Very funny comedy, reminds me of self, always eating soup for one, always chasing women of my dreams, haven't found nada yet! ...Peace."
1,Still Searching,"I have been looking for an instrumental - preferably orchestral- of Phantom of the Opera. I was looking forward to a Piano rendition, but was disapointed with the artistic quality of these Artists. This is nothing better than elevator music. I was severely disappointed in the use of synthesizers. The artist/s always seems to miss the boat (or beat) when emphasizing and/or conveying emotion during play. I know there must be a name for this musically but unfortunately I don't know what that term is. The over-all feeling of this cd is flat and lacking emotion. Andrew Lloyd Webber invested so much time and money into this play/movie and was especially proud of the magnificence of the orchestra used for the movie, I only wish he could have marketed that orchestral recording with out vocals."
5,A Good Book-Thoroughly Enjoyable.!,"A story with twists and turns that keeps you in suspense. The outcome is surprising,I found myself staying up late to read the last 30 or so pages. I highly recommend this book."
4,i love the band but......,i am a very big goo goo dolls fan but every band has a angry album that works for a few situations unlike thier other 5 albums. it is still worth the money becasue james dean is a great laugh you just want to listen to it and up yours works for any break up with you girl or guy. im sad i missed them the first time they came to erie but i caught the may 9 show!
5,Simple Solution IS THE BEST,"Having children, dog, cats, etc....this stuff is absolutely the best and most cost efficient product for sale that I've found so far. It had completely removed all odors from carpeting and padding, and I even used some in the laundry for an incontinent person once with great success! Where is the gallon size?"
3,Not as good as their later music...,"This was my third Slayer album that I bought, and I wasn't too impressed, but, then again, they were probably still trying to find their niche in the whole metal scene, which they did find in thier immortal ""Reign in Blood."" The mixing in it is primitive at best, the bass is too loud and the lyrics also drown out the rest of the sound. If you were to compare this to, let's say, ""Divine Intervention"", you'd say that ""Divine Intervention"" was a bit more innovative and more listenable. A good album, but not as good as thier later music."
5,2 words: HELL AWAITS!!!!,"This album's got it all. Kick ass muscianship, the evil atmosphere, wonderfully written lyrics, and of course lightning speed mayhem. Kicking off the album is the infamous title song ""Hell Awaits"" with it's creepy hypnotic intro, deadly guitarwork from Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman, lightning fast drumming by Dave Lombardo, and of course singer/bassist Tom Araya's precise vocals and earthshaking bass intact. Other great standouts include Necrophiliac, Kill Again, and Hardening Of The Arteries. Slayer rules, wonderful album."
3,"Well, it's Slayer...","Hell Awaits is the first Slayer album I got. And I use the term ""album"" loosely. Not in a bad way, of course, but because of the lack of material.Released in 1985, this album just dosen't cut it. Only seven tracks (though I enjoy all of them) and 35 minutes. Sure, Reign in Blood only clocks in at 29 minutes, but read my review. This album feels like one big song. Every song has to do with Satan and the like. Not much variation.My favorite tracks are Hell Awaits (one of their best, ever), Kill Again (a thrash classic, even if no mentions it), and At Dawn They Sleep. Oh yes, did I mention the production is just as bad as it is on Show No Mercy?I will admit, that about every month, I will pop this CD in and listen to it 4 or 5 times through. Not a good starting point for new fans, but good for buying after you get all their other CD's before Divine Intervention."
5,A Typical Haynes Manual,"This hardback is not as described in the other review. It includes the usual information of Haynes manuals which means that it covers almost everything the home mechanic will perform including engine teardown photos and details. Haynes leaves out repairs that are expert level and the determined mechanic can find information on these repairs if desired.The paper is normal Haynes paper. The pictures are black and white and clear. The book is expensive because it is a hardback and an import from Britian (with such words as Bonnet and Tyre).I will fault Amazon with the current wait time for this item. I ended up getting an excellent used copy for about the same price.Frankly, not sure what Mr. Gushue is talking about."
3,Volvo Maintenance manual,Excellent pictures & write up for general reference. Some info only available in this book or dealers books. This reference gives enough reference info to locate & complete most simple repairs and additional info on some complicated repairs. A couple different manuals like this are required to get a good idea of what is required to remove & replace some parts and do some troubleshooting.
3,"Not enough pictures, UK version","Haynes did not release a US version. So you are stuck with the UK version, driver on the wrong side and funny English. There aren't enough pictures to explain maintenance and repair procedures. You pay for a service manual in order to be sure. You can't be sure if there aren't enough pictures to compare with the actual vehicle. Plus, sizes and specs are located in different chapters. Could use better organization and a US-specific version."
2,NOT SO GOOD VOLVO REPAIR MANUAL,VERY DISSAPOINTING MANUALVERY LOW QUALITY PAPERVERY POOR PHOTOSNOT MUCH INFO WHEN COMPARED TO FACTORY MANUALSVERY OVERPRICED I PAID 38.00 NOW ITS 31.00 STILL WAY OVERPRICED
5,I finally found it listed in amazon,"I am 45 and I got this book (in german: das grüne Buch) as a gift when I was seven. I never forgot it. Once, when I was in 3rd grade, I took it to school and our (mathematics) teacher read it out loud during class. The teacher himself was touched by the book and came to me, and assured that it was a very fine book.I appreciate both artists, Graves and Sendak."
3,SQ to Sarah,"Nice for the first few listening sessions, but not something I could listen to over and over again. Thought it would be more beautiful."
1,"Please do not waste your money, as great as Sarah is.","Being a huge fan of Sarah McLachlan's, I bought this CD as an impulse buy. However, from the beginning chords, I was quite disappointd. The ""essence"" and resonance of Sarah's songs was not at all captured. I don't know if it was because a violin simply cannot convey the depth and meaning of Sarah's vocals, try as it might. The arrangements seemed disordered, scattered in purpose, intonation and mood.Stay with Sarah's actual creations. No offense to the musicians themselves."
2,Mixed to Poor,"Nice style and appearance. Pretty god quality for price/package, good speakers. However some internal problems. You need to place it uphigh good clear view toward front edge of shelf- recieveer location on it for the remote signal is poor. I need a 2x2 inch block under front to elevate it to recieve remote signal. Programming it setting the time and radio stations/channels. Decent not greatest- but get used to doing this. It loses the time very frequently on me (and why unknown, no power outage nothing else in house needs reset). When time lost, mixed as to if it also loses station memory- not alway sbut frequent."
3,Revisting Berlin,"This is a good stage recording based on the Paramount hit movie WHITE CHRISTMAS.The recording captures the energy of the stage performances with the added bonus of added Irving Berlin classics. However, nothing can compare to Rosemary Clooney singing COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS and SISTERS. And, who else but Bing Crosby doing WHITE CHRISTMAS.But, one can enjoy the recording for its own merits if one is not familiar with the original movie sountrack."
2,"This Scrooge doesn't like ""Christmas""","I am a late-comer to this album, and appear to be a dissenting voice, alas. I found this album dull, the biggest problems being that the arrangements have no sparkle (maybe they were meant to capture that lush, and--dare I say--bloated 1950's sound) and the singers (with the exception of Karen Morrow) have no personality. When dealing with material this familiar, you have to bring something extra, and despite the obvious talent that went into this, it is just serviceable. The whole thing reminded me of a Lawrence Welk tribute to Berlin, or a big-budget cruise ship show."
1,Unsatisfied Customer,Complicated!!! Can't put this with my other Itunes and if I can its sooo difficult. Gave this for gifts and my people can't figure it out . No way Ill do this again. LOVE amazon but this is NOT GOOD!!!!
1,HAUNTING MY EARS !,"This CD did nothing but haunting my ears, with its noise, pollution, bad songwriting. Skip it if you can, because Slayer has nothing to offer you. They're after your money, that's all"
4,Sharp,"Another good release from the best of all METAL bands. This EP contains one of the greatest metal songs ever written, ""Chemical Warfare"". The other songs on this EP are above average but nothing special. Buy it just for CW."
3,A Bit Far-Fetched.,"Susan Elizabeth Phillips has a unique writing style which captivates. But the story of this book is a bit too far-fetched. If only she had made the heroine more attractive , beautiful , better-endowed and less dowdy, there would have been stronger chemistry and sexual tension between the couple to make the story more credible.It is a Cinderella type of story except that Dr. Darlington was not portrayed a beauty but a drab middle-aged plain Jane."
1,not worth the price,"This book was recommended to me by a relative. I ordered it and another that was also her recommendation.i could not get interested in this book at all, and it was nothing that I would even have considered. I read it - it was disgusting and I threw it away!! The title was ""Nobody's Baby But Mine"" by Elizabeth Phillips, and it was sexually explicit."
2,disgusting,jane pretty much used cal for his genetics. she disgusted me in her actions and then to try to make a love story out of it was stretching it for me. if you dont mind manipulative individuals then purchase the book and see if you like jane any better than i did
5,Loved It!!!! She's a collectible!!!!,"I was starting to lose interest and faith in the whole romance thing. Everything was getting so cliche, but Susan Elizabeth Phillips has given me a new reason for straining my eyes!!! I could not put this book down. After I was finished reading it (in under 6 hours) I read it all over again. Ms. Phillips has the wit that I have been missing. With this book I have been introduced to many leisure nights of love and humor. I'm already making room on my shelf for her other books!!!"
4,Very Good,"I read it in 2 days! Tugged at your heart at times, and even cracked me up (which is hard to do)."
1,Do not waste your money,"I will preface this review by mentioning that I loved the first two books in this series. Unfortunately, the plot of this book made little to no sense. The truth of the matter is that if someone tricks or manipulates you so that they can get pregnant there is no way that you would ever forgive them let alone marry the person. These two had nothing on common and would not ordinarily be together. Its also not that simple tobe put in contact with professional athletes. The ridiculous plot doesn't end there: SEP never even addresses the fact that a woman with an IQ of 180 would a) seduce a man in that manner Oe b) think that her child would be of average intelligence because one parent is dumb. The book doesn't ever address the obvious self esteem/delusions of the heroine.I loved the first two books in this series so I will be reading the next one."
2,What?,"Normally, I can really trust the customer reviews on Amazon, but I can not believe someone (let alone several people) rated this 4 and 5 stars. Was I reading the same book? I don't have a problem with the kind of far out story line (after all, it is a romance novel, so you can expect some of that) even though I can not imagine what intellegent woman would have the thought process the main character does.... (example: I'm so incredibly brilliant that I honestly believe sleeping with a stupid guy will produce a normal child... Really? I must have missed that little tidbit in biology class.) But mainly, this story was just boring. The characters were one dimentional. Even their huge personal problems were boring. Skip it or just check it out at the library, but don't waste your money."
2,Disappointed after Rubyfruit Jungle,"I really was bored with this book. I had found a great author (and still think she is) after Rubyfruit Jungle and Six of One, but Bingo was a BIG disappointment for me. I was bored stiff and found myself reading and re-reading lines because I'd fallen asleep. Read Rubyfruit Jungle or Six Of One for some great entertainment."
5,One of the funniest books I've ever read!,This book is hysterical! Laugh-out-loud reading. My favorite Rita Mae Brown novel
3,An overrated weed?,"This is a highly evocative book of the life of a skid-row bum in 1930s America--in many ways one of the most evocative accounts of this type of experience I've read since Grapes of Wrath. And yet, I found the book ultimately disappointing. Francis Phelan's character fails to advance in a meaningful way; and thus, the story itself seems static. The story failed to pull me along, and I found myself strangely uninterested in the ultimate fates of the major characters. Part of the problem, I think, is that Phelan's character is a bit implausible. He is portrayed, in some ways, as too good to be true. It is hard to reconcile his altruistic behavior toward the deserving with his murderous past. I also found the sex scene with Katrina overwritten to the point of being incomprehensible. What does this mean, for instance: ""Francis embraced Katrina, and shot into the her the impeccable blood of his first love, and she yielded up not a being, but a word: clemency."""
3,Down and Out in Albany,"I was a bit underwhelmed by this book- although that might have been part of the point. As it gives us a glimpse in to the tragic lives of a few locals, it also gives us a taste of their aimlessness, their rage, and their sorrow.You cannot help but sympathize for the characters (which almost feels condescending), but also it made me wonder: how close are all of us to the edge? What might happen in my life that might cause me to become lost? If anything, this story shows that no one can ever really know what their future holds, and that we should appreciate what we have because it could ALWAYS be worse."
5,"Hope for forgiveness, at the end of the road","In ""Ironweed"", William Kennedy gives us an honest look at Depression-era homelessness, without either trivializing the hardship or glamorizing the dangers inherent in life on the road. There is not an iota of sappy sentiment in ""Ironweed"". In fact, the story of Francis Phelan, former third baseman for the Washington Senators, now a 58-year-old alcoholic bum, can be downright depressing, but not relentlessly so. Although Francis is living with the legacy of his lifetime of mistakes, big mistakes including three deaths and the specters of those he wronged in life, he somehow manages to maintain some measure of dignity and self respect, as do his king-of-the-road cronies. Francis, while flawed, symbolizes belief in the possibility of forgiveness and hope of redemption. Highly recommended."
3,Depressing,"First of all, this book is well-written. Kennedy is very talented. However, the mood is bleak, depressing and one of desolation. It reminds me of the paintings by Edward Hopper, like ""Nighthawks"". That is my main criticism - the pointlessness of this character's life. Let me quote a sentence from the book just to give you the flavor: ""...notable was his ability to understand...the slithy semaphores of the slugs and worms that moved above and through his earth."" For me one book by this author is enough. ('slithy' isn't in my dictionary and I've only heard it in Lewis Carroll's poem 'Jabberwocky') Life has enough muck and mire as it is, thank you very much. In my mind, the book doesn't even begin to explain the mind of the skid-row bum. If it did, that would be an entirely different story."
4,Couple Problems but..,we had a warrenty on it so we got the problems fixed. Their was a strip of different colors going vertical down the side of the screen. We got that fixed but unfortunity the company that fixed it in our area scratched the boarder that surrounds the tv so we had to send it back and get that fixed too.. but everything was free so i have no real complaints! SO far I really love the tv and it is really easy to use! One thing we noticed though.. when your watching a dark movie sometimes when a bright object comes on the screen it blinks purple.. dont know if its just our tv or if its a thing the LG does.. we asked the mechanic and he said he cant figure out why it did it.
4,"A novel about race hatred, not Haiti","Having recently read C.L.R. James's fascinating, Marxist account of the Haiti slave revolt, ""Black Jacobins"", I was excited to learn of a literate, fictional account of the same subject. Now that I've read it, I agree it is literate, but it is more an exploration of the depths of race hatred than a treatment of the Haiti uprising. Most telling is Bell's decision to develop the character of Toussaint only slightly, preferring instead to focus mostly on a fictional white doctor. How Toussaint and his illiterate allies accomplished one of the greatest miliary and political upsets in history is of little interest to Bell. The goal of the book seems to be to impress upon the reader to what appalling depths mankind, black and white, will stoop when a conflict is racial. Although Bell paints many shockingly violent scenes, he didn't convince me that racial forms of hatred are uniquely virulent."
2,Unnecessarily Gruesome,"I suppose I can understand how others could have enjoyed this book - its subject matter is interesting, and it is descriptive and evocative. However, I found all of this atmosphere to be at the cost of character and plot. If you want page-long descriptions of flaying scenes, this is the book for you. If you're more interested in character development and engaging storylines, you'll need to look elsewhere."
4,Outstanding,"Bell's novel recreates the Haitian revolution through the eyes of several different vibrant characters. We as readers come to experience this event as though we were really there. The Island is transformed before our eyes from a slave colony to a surrealistic Hell on earth where bands of men travel the countryside in search of blood and cities burn with regularity. Delving into the minds of slaves, masters and soldiers equally the book shows every side of the event in vivid life. The themes in this book ring out every bit as pertinant today as when the revolution unfolded. The issues of racial hatred and class warfare exist now in America even if they live subdued beneath the surface of everyday life. This novel explores what happens when the shroud is pulled back and the passions and hatred of men is let loose."
1,Look Elsewhere,"I would be surprised if there is a worse Italian language learning tape on the market. A phrase is said in English, then once in Italian. Some are long and complex, and some are obsolete. The tape was originally recorded in 1958 or thereabouts, and includes vocabulary for such items as the milliner's shop and brushless shaving cream."
2,Listen and Learn Italian - New? CD,"Although this is in the format of a new CD, the material dates back to the 50's. I didn't notice that when I bought it; otherwise, I would have chosen a different product. The responses of the Italian translators are not always clear. The examples are typical 50's: lots on the topic of smoking! I chose a CD format so that I could listen to it before retiring or while driving, so that's the good part. But in conscience, I won't resell this particular CD, and would not recommend it at all."
3,There are better options,"I have used several German language resources to try to get a handle on this imposing language.I found this book to be less helpful than Harrap's German Pocket Grammar, which I much prefer. Part of my preference is that more material is covered in more depth in Harrap's. One example: prepositions are covered in 3 pages in Essential German Grammar and while Harrap's devotes 21 pages even though Essential describes prepositions as ""much more complex in their use than [...] English prepositions.Harrap's also is a nice small size which is easier to carry."
3,"Okay, but they're no Saw Doctors","I bought this after falling in love with the song ""Brown Dog"" from Scooby-Doo and the Loch Ness Monster. My kids and I still love that song, and ""ooh lah lah"" made popular to me by Rod Stewart (their version is much better). The rest is average at best. I was hoping for something more after being blown away by the Saw Doctor's ""Sing a Powerful Song"", but this fell well short. Of course, this is a tough comparision, because I believe the SaPS is the best album ever -- but still, I expected a little more."
5,Awesome Book..,"Programming Perl DBI is great book. I'm much of a book ready but this one good. It keeping my attention. I like the how the author taught over the Learning perl and programming perl books. I do however recommend getting some knowledge in perl first, you need to understand the source code in it"
2,Disappointing,"Of the 331 pages of text, 145 pages are an exact reprint of the CPAN DBI documentation (which I had already printed on my laser printer); 76 pages deal with text files, DBM, and SQL. This leaves 110 pages for DBI. For [the price], I was expecting more.The actual 110 pages of DBI are fairly good. The authors should have included examples other than Oracle, and I did not notice any treatment of areas that are different between databases, such as date/time fields. But, the examples included should be quite helpful.Eventhough I am returning my copy back to the book sellers, I would still recommend it for O'Reilly groupies, or people who can not print out the CPAN documentation, or if your job situation requires you to use DBI and you're starting from ground zero. Otherwise, check out CPAN and the message boards.The greatest asset going for this book is the ""Tigger"" factor -- ""It's the only one"" on DBI currently being published (that I know of)."
3,"Great hardcore, Bad basics",I do agree that this book is a must for anyone developing with the perl DBI. This book has shown me that it is an incredibly flexible module and made me think twice about recommending PHP when dealing with db functions. It covers everything from setting up the module to ODBC and SQL manipulation. There are also many things that are not mentioned in the documentation in here. I was frustrated with the lack of examples when it came to database manipulation though. It was not the purpose of this book to cover these areas in depth but to only spend a paragraph on things like the SQL JOIN functions is kind of dissapointing...anybody hear a book idea there?
5,Metalli-history,"This CD is a part of Metallica history, basically Lars had a spot on this CD before he had a band, James and Lars put together Hit the Lights, and had L. Grant throw some leads on it, (which were later updated by Mustaine) and placed this early version of Hit the Lights on the compilation. It's a great CD to have if you are a Metallica fan. James was basically copying the singing style of a band they were extremely influenced by and that was Diamond Head, so the singing style is different from what he later adapted too, as the singing style of DH was way beyond his reach. Cool piece of metal history and the other songs on the CD are decent, but not awe-inspiring."
3,Just what you would expect,"This is thick,chunky, brutal death metal! It is not the cleanest sounding recording, but it is good enough compared to most death metal recordings. This band is excellent live! Ryan is one of the better drummers in death metal and deserves a listen."
4,Cat box bags,I got these bags for my clevercat top opening cat box. They fit the box exactly as desired. The bags work great. The only catch is that the cats front claws tend to poke holes in the bag if I don't trim them often enough.
3,Clever cat Jumbo liners,"I use to buy these at pet smart, then soon they were not available any more.I saw them on Amazon and was happy to be able to buy them again, but the quality is not the same as the ones I bought at pet smart!The top is not long enough, and the thickness of the bags is very thin.....I will use what I have, and look for another alternative ......"
2,"I really like the litterbox, but the liners ...","I SO wish there was a way to make liners without the folds at the bottom! It's nearly impossible for me to scoop the clumped litter out of the ends of the litterbox; the only place my cat pees. Frustrating. I end up putting less litter in and tossing the whole batch once a week = pricey liners. I did try the trash bags instead, as another reviewer mentioned, but didn't have much success there, either. I need this style of litterbox, so I'm willing to stick it out, but I wish the manufacturer would improve this design."
1,I love the box but not the liners!,"The clever cat litter box is VERY clever. The liners, however, are another matter. First of all, once you put the litter in the box it barely goes over the top edge so I have to hold the liner in place while putting the lid on. The liners need to be a little bigger. Second of all, they shred very easily so you need to use at least 2 at a time. Third, people said previously that using regular garbage bags was a better idea because they are cheaper, stronger and fit better. They are absolutely right. I stupidly bought 3 boxes of these so I had to keep using them until they were gone. What a waste of money and plastic. I have also decided to use regular black garbage bags that fit much better and do the job better overall. Plus I don't need to order them online because fourth, you can't find these liners in stores not even the ones who sell the clever cat litter box."
3,Ok,"These are ok. Our cat scratches like crazy it tore holes in like no tomorrow. We just stopped using the bags and just use it without. Kiki (the cat) likes her little box more without the bags. Still a great product. I don't like the sides of it at the bottom, it makes it diffcult to clean because of the folding. It is just OK."
1,Not my favorite bags,"Bummer I havent found a better bag for my clever cat box. These are short and just barely fit the box. So, of course, the cat catches his claws on them and always rips it enough for litter to pass through. Not once have I been able to empty the box without a mess under the bag. I think if they were really CLEVER, the would have thought of a bag that left some space after the litter was put in."
4,great STUDENT piccolo,"This is a fantastic beginner piccolo... I outgrew mine after a few months of playing it. The key mechanism is stiff, but it is really easy to play, more like a flute than a piccolo. If you are just learning to play the picc, or have difficulty doubling flute and piccolo, this is a decent choice for the price. If you are looking for an instrument that will last you for awhile as you grow as a musician, try something else."
2,Good for the Newly Diagnosed Hepatitis C Patient.,"This book is good reading for the person who knows nothing about the Hepatitis C Virus. For the patient who knows even the slightest about HCV, this book will not be of much help. I personally feel that this book was thrown together in a week or two without much thought put into it. Some of the website URLS are not correct."
3,"Out-dated, but...","It is difficult to pan a book, especially since it was one of the first I ever read about hepatitis C. The book's foreword was written by the now-deceased Emmet Keeffe, MD, a man I admired very much. However, although the book filled a big need in the late 1990's, it is now out-of-date and stands along with many better books. Thank you Ms. Roybal for being a pioneer for hepatitis C patients."
1,Bad choice,Air is not staying even for single night. I could not find a way to call seller too to return.
2,Very disappointing,"I bought one of these SwissGear Airbeds and was very disappointed. The mattress was very difficult to fill and by morning was nearly empty. I could find no apparent leaks -- it just wouldn't hold air. The one I had before stayed inflated longer than this one even though it did have a hole in it! So, I went back to using the one with the hole until I could get a new one."
1,HORRIBLE,"SLayer appeared in the musical scenario along with Metallica, Mercyful fate and others. The success of Metallica shows who was the best musicians. Slayer is satisfied with playing disguised as radicals. At least they don't write lyrics like ""Necrophilaic"" anymore..."
3,Very Good ...But Not Slayers best,"This CD has alot of great classic slayer songs.""Black Magic"" ""Die By the Sword,"" and ""The Antichrist"" are some of the best songs Slayer has ever written,and the opener ""evil has no boundaries"" is also very Memorable.I like the satanic overtone slayer has always had in their music...But sometimes it seems like these guys are trying a little to hard to convince us that they worship the devil.That photo of JeffHanneman with the eye liner and the upside down Cross is A little bit silly.The only problem with this record is the production...It sounds as if it was recorded on a 4 track...But it is a great vintage Slayer CD and it is a MUST HAVE for slayer fans"
5,SHOW NO MERCY TO THOSE WHO POSE!!!,"Well this is the first slayer album and it has some definite punk sensibilities (production is crude, guitars don't have much crunch.) But this album has The Antichrist and Black Magic which are two of the best songs in metal history. Araya uses that wild rising howl the most in this album that is really a trademark of early Slayer (akin to that of Tom G Warrior's 'OUGH!') Even in this stage Slayer had a very unique style of thrash metal."
5,great debut,"This cd is awesome. This is the greatest debut of i band i have ever heard. Every song is good, no filler here. Really outstanding tracks though are Metal Storm/Face The Slayer, Tormentor, and Crionics. Slayer are a really great band, they play good and Dave is ... amazing on the drums. Especially the double bass, its so crazy. For the people who say the production ... on this album, what do you expect it to sound like it was recorded in the early/mid 80's! i think the production is perfect actually, the underground or basement feel (hahaha) really gives this album more definition."
3,THE BIRTH OF....SLAYER!!!!,"if you where buying metal albums back in the early 80's as i was,this album got your attention.this was much heavier than Metallica,much better musicianship than Venom-their really werent any contenders(Bathory was at least another year or two away).slayer took the dual guitar attack of Judas Priest,coupled it with the-then emerging thrash scene and a monster was born.i always prefered Slayer to other thrash bands because they where HEAVY.speed was secondary to the almighty riff.Today,this album has aged REASONABLY well.the cover and it's lyrical attempts at evil are just plain ridiculous.it is really funny to me that concerned parents REALLY bought that this stuff was to be taken seriously!anyway,the lyrics and some of the musical arrangements on this album firmly place it in the early 1980's.for that reason,the three stars.true classics should be timeless.this one is not."
3,Blueprint for Slayer...,"First of all, to the guy who said Lombardo was Slayer...I hate people like you. Morons like you shouldn't be allowed to be fans of Slayer. Slayer are a BAND, no one member possesses all of the cards, and let me tell you, if you don't own the killer Divine Intervention, proof that Lombardo wasn't the band, that I suggest you should. I don't recall Lombardo writing any sprawling riffs, and while he was a great drummer, he was by no means the band. Plus Bostaph rules too.But back to the point at hand...This album is by no means phenomenal, but really a blueprint for what was to come from Slayer. While not overly original, sinister, or thrashy, it was a more melodic Slayer, more influence from Maiden and Priest than their thrash predessors. Check out ""The Anti-Christ"", ""Evil Has no Boundaries"", and ""Metal STorm/Face the Slayer"" for some great tracks...but beware...their better material was to follow!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time And Money,"This book was one of the worst books I have ever read. From a historical perspective, other than the fact that the Socialist/Communist revolution takes place in the USA instead of Russia, it is an exact recap of our 20th century timeline. In addition, the authors have an annoying habit of throwing famous real (Colonel Van Damme) and fictional names (the Blues Brothers and President JR Ewing) into the stories for no apparent reason. On the positive side, the book does start out promising. The first three stories are rather interesting, but for the rest of the book, the authors seem to have run out of ideas and simply filled pages to complete the novel. In short, don't waste your time and money on this book."
4,Excellent story for Young Children,My youngest daughter loved the story. I gave it to her for her 5th birthday. I have read this book to her twice already. What a great bonding experience. An I must say I really enjoyed the story as well
4,Great Sheets,"These sheets have been so great! They are extemely soft, cool and comfortable. The only downside is they wrinkle a lot (and I don't iron sheets.) However, it is a minimal downside, and we liked them so much we bought a second set."
5,Addictive,"There isn't a single throwaway song on this smart, fun, completely addictive album. I love it!"
4,"OK Go, to the music store.","This band surprised me at first with the viral internet music video of ""Here It Goes Again"" (the treadmill video). I decided to look into them a bit more, and got the album Oh No. The songs like Television, Television, and It's a Disaster, show the talent in this band, not only in the music itself but in the lyrics. Their older album that is self-titled, is great as well. My recommendation...get them both."
3,Their first album is just so much better...,"I had fantastic hopes for this album since I love their first one. I've tried listening to it a few times and it just flounders in comparison. Sorry to those who like it [I really wanted to love it!!!]. To those that like their first album, check out Supersystem and the Infadels (be sure to get spelling correct on the latter one].Peace"
4,Clever Pop for the ADD Nation,"No one can accuse OK Go of staying in one place for too long. Listening to ""Oh No"" is like spending summer camp in a cabin full of ADD campers: they can't sit still, they won't sit still, some of it will make you buggy...but when they're good, they're very, very good. The CD is worth your money, for 5 songs alone. The lead song ""Invincible"" is clever, power pop (someone WILL ask you to turn it down). ""Maybe, This Time"" is a welcome & provocative moody piece. ""Lately It's So Quiet"" is an odd little gem. ""A Million Ways"" will stick in your head. And, ""Let it Rain"" has fascinating time signature changes. This is fun, melodic stuff, expertly executed, with a tongue-in-cheek sensibility."
3,better than average msb,"msb was still finding its sound here. several excellent songs like ""were not strangers"" and 'beautiful lies""you can see where they are headed.."
2,Very Odd,Tjis video is AWEFUL!!!! It is full of creepy things which I'm kinda into but this is a really strange video...
3,"child enjoyed, but a bit odd for adults","My little girl (7 years old) watched ""Wee Sing in the Marvelous Musical Mansion"" and LOVED it, we would borrow it all the time from the library until we just ended up buying it.So, we decided to also buy ""Wee Sing in the Big Rock Candy Mountains"" while we were at it, thinking that it would be the same caliber. While both have cheesy acting, and a lot of singing; ""Musical Mansion"" had a much more interesting plot line, and I felt was somewhat educational in that it taught musical terms.If I watch this for more than 20 minutes, I get bored and find something else to do while my little one finishes it; she likes it well enough, but for something that parents can enjoy along with their kids, I'd recommend ""Musical Mansion"" instead."
3,Could be better,"I really loved this movie as a child, and I got it for my 1 year old son to watch. After watching it again I find it just OK. My son isn't as entertained as he is by other videos."
3,A Little Strange...But Ok,"Like all the other videos in this series, I was forced to watch this movie many times throughout my elementary school years. Wee-Sing pretty much WAS our music class. This one was pretty frequently used, and was actually pretty entertaining.A basic summary of the plot: A little girl travels through her playhouse to a fantasy world inhabited by a bird (?), a furry blue creature of some kind, three pastel mice, two furry brown creatures who eat too much, and a pinkish/purpleish bunny named (of course) Bunny Foo Foo. They play some games, watch a fly and a bee get married, sing, and of course learn a valuable lesson about playing nicely with others. The story itself is ok, but the setting and characters are a little weird. To this day I don't know what the female furry creature was supposed to be."
4,Snoodle-Doodles.,"This was never my favorite movie, although it is good. I would reccommend Sillyville or Sally's Birthday Party, or even Marvelous Musical Mansion. I watched ALL the movies when I was little. But now that Im a little older (17) I cant get over the fact that the Snoodle-Doodles remind me so much of that creepy bear thing in the movie ""The Shining""..."
4,Innapropriate... To Say the Least,"I simply cannot approve of the nickname ""Corpsegrinder."" A person of his age and stature simply must have a more appropriate nickname such as ""Mr. Corpsegrinder."" I mean, come on folks, he is a role model let's have some maturity. Which brings me to my next point which is ""Corpsegrinder"" simply does not inspire fear in me for corpses are already dead. It would be much better if his name was something like ""Babyeater"" or ""Fetuslicker."" If this was changed I would find the album much more enthralling and wonderful but, as it stands, it really leaves a little bit to be desired."
5,What death metal was meant to be,"This CD has got to be one of the most influential Death Metal recordings ever. Any technique you want to know of, listen to this and Rob Barrett and Jack Owen has done it. Every song has something to remember about it, wether it be the riff or the lyrics that just stick in your head. This is a must have for a Cannibal Corpse fan and you should just have it anyways. Why the heck did anyone give this less than a 5 star review?"
5,Catchy Gore Soaked Metal,"By far the most memorable and catchy Cannibal Corpse album recorded. While not quite as brutal as albums to follow, it still holds its own in regard to pleasurable listening. One of the more mainstream death metal albums (though far from MTV material), this album stands out as ""something different"" from CC. Maybe its because they actually slow it down on some songs. Rob Barrett easily smokes Bob Rusay on guitar and I would recommend this to anyone interested in wetting their toes with death metal. Every song is killer, and the lyrics, though more tame than previous works, are still at their best. One thing I find lacking with later Corpse albums are lyrics. I've seen them play 3 times, twice with Barnes and once with George. All shows rocked equally......need I say more"
2,Fair,"The Bleeding is a definite disappointment after CC's masterpiece ""Tomb of the Mutilated"". Tracks like ""stripped..."" have a good intro, but then fall apart. There are no sustained brutal sections that are worth listening. Only a few sections stand out, aspects which make this album fall from expectations."
1,it doesn't get any sicker than this,"Seriously, what deranged lunatic would appreciate this music. Just listening to the sound bites is enough to make my skin crawl. I felt like I needed to take a shower afterwards.This is just pure demonic works. Music? No. Force fed broken glass? Sick.I wish I could give this album and every single one a negative 5. Actually I wish I could remove every single album that every person owns and have a huge bonfire in celebration of the destruction of that crap.Would you want your son or daughter listening to that?Is that becoming of a person?If you could care less what your children listen to, that's the reason for the endless cycle of mayhem and violence we see today. Parents could care less, so children end up not caring, their children, and on and on and on. So sad.Parents, pay attention to what your kids listen to!!!If you find they listen to this stuff (crap), get them to psychological counseling now!! PRAY!!!This is the crap that breeds serial killers!!!"
1,Their worst ever...,"Well, if this is CC best album ever, I imagine their worst...This is another piece of junk released by the worst band on Earth, a band led by talentless musicians. And some people still buy it... I'd rather buy Madonna albums than the albums by these sick guys...."
1,Tricked!,"It's the same song looped over and over, they just start playing it from different parts so they trick you and make you think it's a different song. You got tricked!"
1,I don't think they are bad musicians... they are bad people.,"I don't think Cannibal Corpse are bad musicians. Enjoying death metal or not is a question of musical taste, every person has its own. And, inside a genre, of course there are good and bad musicians.I'm not discussing the quality of CAnnibal Corpse's musicians. I'm discussing their character, their personality. What kind of person would, given the opportunity to make a record deal to record aggressive and no commercial music, use this opportunity to write such disgusting, bad, mean, obnoxious, insane, malevolent and utter evil lyrics? Why would a musician in his right frame of mind do it?!! WHy would them hire artists to draw such evil cover arts? I'm not saying ""evil"" in the religious sense, I mean evil in ideas, in character.I hate this band with all my heart (and this an evil feeling, I know!)and I hope they dissapear forever."
2,Outrospective re-released with a bonus?,"The bonus disk contains 10 mixes, nearly half already released in previous singles (Muhammad Ali, Tarnatula and Crazy English Summer) For me it was somewhat worth it because I never had the chance to get the singles, for others it will be somewhat of a disappointment due to the fact that this edition isn't as good as a Satruday 3PM or Irrreverence. Only thing concidered new are three never before heard mixes of ""We come 1"", occasional ""Step Too Far"", and a ""Muhammad Ali""None-the-less, I love this group and I will accept what's given in this cd. I recommend those who don't have Outropective nor the singles to listen before buying. If you already have the cds and singles, I'd save my money for a possible ""Introspecitve"" remix project due in the Fall. I give this 2/5 because few mixes could've been better."
5,Not exactly a review,"This is not a review, althoght I think this album is great. I just want to point out that ""Not enuff love"" is basically taken from an old tune (early '70s) by Rare Bird. The song is ""Sympathy"", and i suggest you all to listen to it, it is great."
4,Almost,"I Love Faithless. But there is something strange about this album that i can't quite put my finger on. Most of the tracks individually are excellent but as a whole it seems empty. Really there is no point in 'Machines R Us' being on the album as there is already one similar instrumental track, the fantastic opener ""Donny X"" Which borrows its lyrics from the opening track to faithless' first album ""Reverence"". Maxi's Lyrics to ""Giving Myself Away"" are great but the music seems a bit flat and empty. Of course there's no denying the brilliance of Faithless. Not Ennuf Love, We Come 1, Crazy English Summer and One Step Too Far are all Fantastic Songs."
3,A Decent Read,"I didn't really like the way that Yakage story turned out (Tenchi seemed to be a little wimpy at times), but that story involving Tenchi's illness was awesome from beginning to end!!"
3,"Not bad, but she's no Bombeck","I read this collection because I had heard the author was a modern day Erma Bombeck, who I absolutely love. I don't see it. Yes, there were a few funny parts, but nothing as good as anything Bombeck ever wrote. This book may appeal to someone who is married with kids, which I am not."
5,"Great storytelling, could be the motion picture of the year!","It never occurred to me to read a book and feel so mesmerized by the storytelling that I could actually visualize what was happening. Well, this is what happened with Steve Bell's ""Secret Revelation"". I just couldn't put it down. Wonderfully written, deeply compelling and one of the best ideas I have come across in years."
5,Perfect,I was afraid i wasnt able to find the ribbon because i hav an older model.im so pleased and happy
5,The Great Pyramid - Altar to Almighty God!,"E. Raymond Capt brings to light an obscure prophecy found in the book of Isaiah: ""In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the Lord. And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the Lord of Hosts in the Land of Egypt"" (Isaiah 19:19-20). Mr. Capt reveals that the Great Pyramid of Giza is the fulfillment of this prophecy, and demonstrates through a map of the region how this ""Testimony in Stone"" could be located in the midst of the land of Egypt while at the same time at its border. This monument was shown to contain not only complex mathematical calculations, unknown to the people of that time, but also an accurate prophetic timeline of the plan of God. Amazing!"
5,"Great First Novel, Watch for This Author","What a great book! This book gets my endorsement and I am a Young Adult Librarian who reads YA novels, and this is a truly exceptional novel, it would definelty appeal to boys, I cannot wait to read his next novel. There is great character development and believeable, a trait that lacks in so many of the novels I have read. Watch for great things from this author."
2,Didn't really like it,"After being blown away by ""The Woman in White"", I decided to check out a shorter Wilkie Collins book following the misadventures of a rogue. The book just never grabbed me. I enjoyed the rogue's sense of humor, but never got invested in the character. He aimlessly wanders from one minor misdeed to the next. The book culminates in what's supposed to be a suspenseful plotline, which for me just fell flat."
1,THIS BOX IS NOT THE SIZE THEY SAY IT IS !!,THE ITEM DESCRIPTION IS WRONG! I GOT THIS IN THE MAIL AND THE ACTUAL SIZE IS 6 X 7 X 8.5. MY MONEY IS BEING REFUNDED BUT IT WONT BE FAST ENOUGH FOR ME TO GET A REPLACEMENT. I CHECK MANUFACTURER WEB SITE AND IT ONLY COMES IN THE SIZE THAT WAS SHIPPED TO ME. I WOULD HAVE GIVEN ZERO STARS IF IT WAS AN OPTION.
4,a little miffed....,"I recently purchased this CD SOLELY because it was my understanding it had a ""hidden"" track, noted on this page by ""15. Untitled Track"", SUPPOSED to be Space Oddity, one of my all-time favorite songs & again, the SOLE reason I wanted the CD in the first place... well, its not there. Did I miss something?!!!"
4,Try to not smile,"Quirky, surprising and beautifully done. Bowie fundamentalists may cringe, but the Brasiliero touch to his music is very very clever. Recommended."
5,Good crock pot,"I bought this crockpot because I have a smaller version of this brand and I wanted to be able to make more food at a time. On average if I make beef stew in the smaller crockpot, then that will be one meal for us. I wanted to be able to have leftovers, so I bought this bigger one.It works very well and holds a LOT of food. The first time I used this it smelled a little rubbery but after a few hours it seemed to go away.I didn't anticipate exactly how big it would be, so storage is kind of a problem, but that's my fault and nothing to do with the product.I would recommend to anyone who wants to be able to feed 4-5 people or have leftovers several times."
5,REALLY GREAT!,After watching Donnie Darko (several times) I ordered MAD WORLD by Michael Andrews - Gary Jules and really love this music. It sticks in your head and sorta makes everyday problems seem less important or something! I highly recommend this for sure. Believe me I have bought alot worse :)
1,unhappy customer,I got this mixer yesterday and i must say it is horrible being so happy for a product to come in only to realize that you can't even use it... why you ask? because it didn't come with a power adapter!!!!! how am i supposed to even try out the product if i cant turn it on. also I dont know what happened to the original butter like fader but this one was not that. I bought this mixer after extensive research and playing with a fellow DJs and I was very impressed but the one that I received was far from perfection. I have decided to not contact the seller about this information but rather instead of going through hassle of sending it back and making sure money is returned I just bought a innofader and am going to hopefully find a replacement adapter.
5,BEAD CROCHET,"Great information and instructions for bead crochet, bead knitting , and beaded knitting. Finally you will be able to see the difference between the 3. Fantastic projects that just make you want to try them, even if you don't knit, you will certainly want to learn plus a very nice gallery of one of Ms. Chin's creative creations, book is certainly a great addition to your knitting/crochet library."
4,"cute, practical, not as sturdy as I had hoped","The bins have soft sides and removable bottom reinforcement. Nice for a small toybox, but due to the fabric only sides (metal frame to support) it does not hold heavier or pointed objects well. I would be afraid that they would puncture the fabric. Overall, cute and functional in with the coordinating bedding and room decor."
5,"Perfect for it's purpose, note, it is soft sided","This is a good looking, well made storage bin. I got it for my daughter to stuff under her bed in the dorm.Note, it is soft-sided. The bin has a simple, but sturdy, wire frame. The ultrasuede fabric wraps around the frame, with a hard flat bottom. The ultrasuede wraps around the top of the frame and is held on with long velcro strips all the way around (on the inside). ""Unzipping"" the velcro is how you remove the fabric for spot cleaning.The bin is soft-sided, because the sides are made up of the ultrasuede fabric (backed by a slim cushiony black fabric), suspended between the bottom and the velcroed top. However, the sides are not real flimsy, either. I wouldn't use this bin to store nails and power tools, but it works fine for bottles of vitamins and dorm dishes or, of course, sweaters and other clothes.It looks very nice, not cheap. Recommended!"
2,Picture and description do not match,"Picture is for the fifth 2010 edition, which is what I needed. Book received is the fourth 2002 edition, which is what is described."
4,Nice Jeans,Love the fit. It's been a while since I bought jeans. And I was nervous buying them online. But they're true to size. And they have a little bit more room than the regular fit. So they get over my thighs easily
5,Great jeans,"I just wrote a review about Wrangler Rugged jeans where I also gave a 5 star rating. I am a Levi's convert, ordered these jeans on a whim, and I think these Lees, as well as the Wrangler Rugged jeans, are great. The fit is comfortable and they seem quite sturdy. Size ran about the same as Levi's. After 30 + years of wearing the same brand of jeans, I thought it was time to try something else - part of this is probably due to the fact that my mom made me wear JC Penney jeans when I was a kid and they were so uncool I decided to wear Levi's the rest of my life. Anyway, I finally switched and am quite happy with the decision."
5,The best blanket for babies,I absolutely love the blanket. It's soft and large. I plan to get another one.
2,Disappointing!,"This book was a total disappointment. Several of Joanna Lund's books were recommended to me, so I thought this would be a sure winner. The recipes looked easy, straight forward and relatively appealing and healthy (aside from frequent use of artifical sweetners, including saccharin!). For Easter, I made several of the recipes and they were a complete and total disaster! The Key Lime Pie was so bitter, it was inedible (thankfully, my family has a good sense of humor). I would not recommend this book at all-- it is, by far-- one of the worst cookbooks I have ever purchased."
3,not what I thought but still good,"It was nothing like the movie Chocolate, but it was still a good movie, the story line was terrible, but the fighting scenes were good."
2,all you need to know... NOT as good as Chocolate,"I saw this cover and I saw oh wow !!! SHE'S BACK !! and its called RAGING PHOENIX !!I cant wait !!! ..... then.... I saw it... was very sad.The movie is pretty confusing and all over the place. Let me just say someone is collecting tears. ok. TEARS FROM GIRLS. then there are other characters with way too much screen time that, frankly, I dont care about.Bottom line... I bought this movie to see her in some great action scenes with perfect choreography and hard hitting sound fx. THAT IS NOT IN THIS MOVIE.sorry.Hope her next movie is better. I AM A HUGE FAN OF CHOCOLATE and dont want her to fade away."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought two of these roboraptors for my grandson's. One of them didn't work at all, the other barely walked and only on a smooth, flate surface. The one that did work, only worked for a week. Very disappointed grand kids and grandma!"
5,A new companion is born,"My mini roboraptor is always big fun. I like it when he opens his jaw,walks in circles around my big roboraptor, and his articulated arms. But it would have been better if it had baby dinosaur sounds. But i still love it."
1,This album SUCKS,"This is before fates warning was a decent progressive band, in this album it's clear that the pressures of the eighties shred metal era was the sound they were trying to get, some nice progressive stuff, but very repetivive music, I believe in albums there should be balance, there is none in this one, get the later stuff, the new live album is good, and so is parallels"
3,50/50,"This book was all right. I thought it was going to be imaginative in the beginning but it became too mushy with all the feelings coming up over and over again between the characters. It was an okay story but it was just too typical- too scared and scarred to love but damn they are just so sexy I think I might (no real basis for their feelings, other than 'meant to be')... maybe I shouldn't, oh, but I must! You already know what's going to happen really, I just kept reading, hoping something unexpected would happen."
5,man with a camera,If you are a Bronson fan you must buy this dvd!Bronson shows in a early stage of his carrier that he was a great actor (in my opinion the best ever!)
4,Good pocket dictionary!!,I recomend this pocket dictionary for fast access to the signs to express more than 1000 common concepts. Practical for have always near when learning the most frequent used words in ASL.
2,"I couldnt help, but had to put it down","It seems to be a book for nurses, but definitely not for laypeople or doctors. I have worked on an ICU and I found the book- stilistically badly written,- way too long,- more an information textbook mated with a school-girl-diary than a good novel!I cannot recommend it at all. Save your time and don't buy it.(except you're a nurse and might recognize yourself in the story).Read House of God instead, it's brilliant!"
5,Good book for people looking to be a nurse,"I liked this book, my only wish is that it was more current. Times have changed very much since this book was written so though it gives insight on nursing many aspects have changed. I enjoyed her written style and thought it was informative and entertaining. Just bought her second book TENDING LIVES."
1,it leaks,"Bought these at West Marine (for $39.99) and installed, looked good. After first use the left light stopped working, I looked to find water had gotten inside and broken the bulb. The neoprene gasket does not make a good seal, I verified this in the pool at 2' deep - bubbles. Verdict: defective. Returned."
2,Overrated stoner noir,"This is the heir of Raymond Chandler? Please. The book goes like this: Hillbilly PI is sent out to find a bearded, macho writer (a Hemingway stand-in). He finds him drinking beer with a bulldog (the novel's single instance of invention). The two of them then decide to quest after a girl ten years gone. On the way, they drink (wow!) and do drugs (while drinking? cutting edge!) and admire the thighs of blue-collar women. This book completely lacks the romance, humor, and stylistic brilliance of Chandler, as well as the narrative rewards of lesser hardboiled novels. Skip it."
1,Does Not Fit Change Pad,"I chose this cover for the color and material. I was very disappointed when I put it on the change pad and it did not fit. Our change pad is a standard size by Summer Infant. It did not fully cover the sides and I put something in the center, about the weight of a baby (I am due next month) the corners lifted off. It is too bad because I really liked it and had to return it."
1,A book with no redeeming features,"I had a hearty laugh over a used John Norman book a friend brought over, ""Tribesmen of Gor,"" a colorful,purply-prosed desert space opera with slave girls. ""So bad it's good!"" I picked up Captive of Gor with the same expectation and was deeply disappointed, primarily because the main character, Elinor, is such a shallow, self-deceiving twit, impossible to sympathize with. The plot - such as it is - proceeds with glacial slowness, interrupted by snivelling catfights and petty snitching. Little of the color or culture of Gor is presented, and little of the amusing bombast of Tarl Cabot. Not recommended."
2,"I tried to be Patient with ""Patience""","After my first listen to GM's new CD I totally hated it. It sounds nothing like the GM that I'm used to from past CD's. All of the songs have NO connection and there isn't even ONE big single among them. I thought if I listened to ""Patience"" a few more times that I would at least be able to pick out a favorite song, but that has not been the case. GM needs to go back into the studio and create music and songs from his heyday of the late 1980's and 1990's. Then - maybe - he will have some more hits on his hands."
5,Heavy Rotation,"I dunno. I've read the other reviews and don't get it. The songs on Patience are F-Fantastic. I think there is great variation and the lyrics and singing combine to create a really moving and interesting album from top to bottom. There is not one song I don't like, my favorites being maybe Amazing and Precious Box. I have listened to Patience many times now and my appreciation for it grows each time. I think George is really a savior for popular music and it's a pitty the corrupt music industry won't allow him to be heard in the USA. Give the album 2 full listens and you'll be hooked too...IMHO! wade"
3,An ordinary release from a media icon,"I've been a fan of George's since that mind-rotting song ""Wake Me Up Before You Go Go"". Man, you can't get it out of your head!! I've purchased all of GM's recordings, including this one, but I'm the least happy with this one. Here's why:I think the material on this CD is pretty weak. Not that it is not good, but it's weak. There are three exceptions though, that make this album tollerable: John And Elvis Are Dead (excellent song! my favorite on the CD), Flawless (a truly gay anthem with a techno dance flair) and Freeek 04! (a steamy song about everyone's favorite activty - hehe). Otherwise, it's a bit off. George has such a powerful voice and it sadly doesn't get showcased enough on this recording.If this is truly GM's last studio album, I'll be sad. I think his final release should be an upbeat dance album. Even if he has to do a few covers, he can pull it off. I'd much rather remember him as going out on TOP, rather than just going out."
3,George Michael's Patience is a disappointment,"I really don't know what thebig hype was about when GMwas to release his latestcd ""Patience"". Yes, weknow in Great Britain,his songs have beenthe most played on radio,but this album really sucksIt has no life, too manyself indulgent notes thatjust goes nowhereIf u new fans to GM,check out the followingcds that best coverhis most prolific hey days:1/ Wham---Remixes(A new spin on Wham's early days)2/ GM: Faith (really hip tunes)3/ GM: Prejudice (maturation period)4/ GM: OlderI think if GM is to have bettersuccess with future albums, he'sgot to go back to basic and thinksimple harmony with soul. Notcomplex harmony that goes nowhere"
5,Absolutely flawless music.,An astonishing work of art..this album convince me that this man is one of the best pop artist from England...his music is breathtaking.
4,Disagree If You Must ...,"... but George Michael still got it. The sign of true talent is a skill which does not deteriorate with age or infrequent use. George Michael, in my opinion, has real talent. I loved this album; heard Cars and Trains on Rhaposody and made my move. Unfortunatley, some artists suffer because even though they have the talent, the material they get or the production suffers. Overall, I don't think this happened to GM this time out. I recommend it."
1,Dull dull dull - he's lost his edge,"I've been a George Michael fan for years. I've been particularly impressed with his recent stuff - the balads, re-makes, and fun dance tunes from the last couple of years have an originality not usually found with pop music. So I was excited about this new CD and sprung for it, even though it's an expensive import. What a mistake. Boring. Dull. Cliche. Self-involved. He's lost his edge. Wait for a used copy - it'll be in the discount rack in no time."
1,Dissapointed,I was really hoping this would work for me since I read a lot of positive reviews :(This dried up my hair and didn't seem to help with my excessive hair loss. I am highly disappointed.
1,burns scalp!,"i've used this product twice so far. it burned my scalp. i felt pain all over my scalp when i comb my hair. the chemical in this shampoo is too strong, the hair near my hairline are falling out."
5,One of the Devotional Classics of Christianity,"I've read Hannah's book twice and the chapter ""Is God in Everything?"" several more times. This book is thoroughly biblical, very helpful, and highly recommended for new Christians. She wisely distinguishes between internal temptations and sin (something I remember struggling with as a new Christian - and I didn't have this book, unfortunately) and shares with the greatest of Christian mystics the truth revealed in the chapter ""Is God In Everything?"" I put this book right up there with ""Abandonment to Divine Providence"" by Jean-Pierre de Caussade, ""Centuries of Meditations"" by Thomas Traherne, and ""A Testament of Devotion"" by Thomas Kelly. The latter book is another Quaker classic. - Brad Clark"
1,Christian Secret of a Happy Life,This book looks like a printing reject. It has no border around the printing and some of the word endings are missing.
4,a good book,"A very exciteing book, but with some flaws such as: most people have no idea of what words like alas, alack-a-day and woe mean. but otherwise it is a great book"
5,How to Be Successful and Human Too!,"This is one of the best books on business and finance I've ever read. As stated before, the book does not tell you how to become rich. It tells you how to be. The impression one gets of Mr. Getty is a highhly intelligent, liberal thinker. He shatters the myth that is so often portrayed; that the rich are selfish, overly conservative people who care nothing for society around them. While this may be true of some, it is not true of all. Mr. Getty discusses a way of being, a philosophy that is both tough and humanistic. He shatters many other myths as well. He points out that becoming wealthy is not a result of knowing things others don't, or cheating innocents, but instead entails hard work, persistance, patience, common sense, and risk. This is a must read for anyone with aspirations of becoming successful in the business world. Well worth the paltry sum it costs."
5,Good Stuff!,I brought this after I saw the youtube video with the african american woman. It taste pretty good and I think its helping with my hair growth. I do however take other vitamins in pill form as well as this drink so I can't only attribute this to my hair growth and strong nails but it's not hurting it. I've been drinking it for about a month now. I'm now on my second bottle. I only wish they sold it at a local health food stores like Vitamin Shoppee or GNC. I would definitley buy this product again.
1,"pretty ring, terrible band","The stones on this ring are a nice size and color. Unfortunately, the band is so narrow and so thin that it bends just putting it over your knuckle. The people were very nice and prompt issuing the refund when I returned it, but the band was so flimsy that you couldn't do anything to fix it."
3,Know what you're buying!,"I really enjoy John McGann's playing and usually enjoy his instructional material. Before you buy this one, you should be aware that it is mainly a lecture with him playing some music. The information is concise and well presented, and should be helpful to many folks. There is no tab or instructional documentation. In addition, he doesn't present lots if drills or play-along material. He sticks to the fundamentals."
5,Review,"This is a great CD, it brings back many memories from my childhood!!!!! Yes I remember when there was lots of great music and really great musicians."
2,"Useful for balance, although at times seems hyperbolic","I bought this book because i was genuinely concerned about the harm vaccines might do to my sweet baby. While the book contained some useful information, the evidence she cites doesn't fulfill the promise of the title. The most useful thing about this book was the message that it's okay to ask questions and that parents have choices. I felt better about giving my child most of the recommended vaccines because I was making an informed choice after looking at both sides of the issue."
1,Out of Date,This book is so out of date that I don't think any pediatricians use the vaccines or techniques ( such as stacking vaccines) they warn you about. All this book did was scare me. I did learn a few things about vaccines and were to get the latest information. Overall not worth the time and the scare.
1,OLD INFO,"Although I am sure the book HAD great info, I think it is a true shame it wasn't made cleat that the info is old and outdated ... I do feel like i was ripped off!"
5,Must read for new parents,"If you have a baby or going to have a baby, you are going to hear about vaccinations. There is more to know about vaccinations then just the autisim debate. If nothing else read this book to find out what is in the vaccinations that you are going to give to you children and what they are vaccinating the kids against."
2,BAD Science,It's truly freitening what the American public is dumb enough to believe. Every single scrap of current scientific research has proven over and over again the safety of our vaccinations. Conspiracy theorists abound about vaccines just like governmet coverups of UFO's. There is NO proof that these vaccines are harmful except in the RARE case of allergic reaction. I hope to never see the day when we listen to BAD science books like this piece of garbage and see thousands of children a year die of diseases that are preventable by the miracle of vaccination!I'm relatvely sure that all these parent would be lining up at my office for their flu shot when the pandemic hits!Some advice---learn how to read scientific articles an don't beleive everything you read on the internet and in junk novels!
4,Wonderful for a beach read,"Three middle-aged women have a holiday in London; they've been friends since sharing a Midwestern childhood and are now all variously dissatisfied with their lives. The bed & breakfast house in which they stay is run by the elusive, charming, and secretive Mrs. Smith-Porter who seems to be a helpful angel of some sort.Not a deep book, but no one ever said it was; just a thoroughly enjoyable way to pass the day on a screened porch with a fan, a squeaky rocker, and a glass of iced tea."
3,Relic,"The acting is bad - no Barrymores here. The story isn't special because we'd see it a thousand times in ""A Star Is Born"" or any of that ilk referring to nobodies out for stardom. The dancing is average, definitely no ""42nd Street."" The makeup is too heavy. This is clearly a piece that has too much of an experimental look to it. It's saving grace is the catchy tune that's still around today, ""Broadway Melody."" And don't say that all of my gripes are because it was made in 1929 because ""All Quiet On The Western Front"" and ""The Champ"" are two very fine movies made during the same era. Heck, there are silent films better than this one: ""Sunrise,"" ""The Crowd,"" et al. Just because it's an old legend doesn't make it a great movie, so tone down on the 5 stars there folks."
3,The scent is a lateral move from cat piss,"Occasionally my cat enjoys a nice big wee in the kitchen. The flooring is a pvc tile (the grey raised coin design that seems to be popular for laundry rooms or garages)and while its an easier clean-up than carpet, the surface is still rather porous and a cruel task to clean up (that darn raised coin pattern.)To be honest, I'm not sure if this solution works at all because the smell is so nauseating that I'm forced to scrub the floor with baking soda, vinegar, oxi clean and an orange cleaner afterwards just to remove the Simple Solution scent. It's nearly an all day event.I would imagine that as a prewash spray, it would be alright. Otherwise it smells like a box of wet baby wipes - that have been used and soiled."
2,just ok,"i really liked the starfist series when it first started. but in this new book the marines are used to kill the leader of a memeber world of the confederation based on flimsey intelligence. for a government that has a secret prison planet where people are held with out trial or recoure called darkside. where a marine kills a helpless conferderaton citizen because the little he saw may expose the confederation's secret op against one of its own memeber worlds. i like stories to be more white than black maybe that's my sense of whats right, i just found this to be to dark for my tastes."
5,CD-ROM's still a great tool!,"Enjoyed this cd-rom. The clarity and colors were wonderful. Blake would be very proud....From the companies web site one can buy a ""Blake bundle"" and it's like getting a free cd-rom...Peace, AJ"
2,"not bad, not good","This player is a great size and has a great picture, but gets hot through about 3/4's of every dvd I played in it. Also it won't play VCD's no matter what is says in description. I own every kind of vcd and scvcd and it would not play them. It also had a hard time with my cdr's and cdrw's. If you want an cheap dvd player for travel this one is ok, but otherwise there are better ones out there on the market!"
1,Stay Away!,"I just want to warn you about this companies equipment. They don't stand behind it at all. So far I have owned 2 of their prodects and neither one has lasted 1 year. Unfortunately, their warentee is for 90 days. This Portable DVD players battery never worked (I brought 3 of them back before I got one that worked and that one stopped working after 40 days...and the batteries only warenteed for 30 days). This company does not stand behind their products and their customer service...well I guess they call it that...is useless. Trust me...don't buy anything from them. Save your money!!!"
3,Not that great,"Not the best cartridge to get. The sound isn't that clear and crisp & the first one I got I had to take back because it simply didn't work out of one channel. Best advice - listen to the audiophile's warning. This really was made to be played at a loud venue where the intricacies and details of the tune's/sounds aren't being concentrated on, and this is a good stylus to scratch if you're into it.Stanton's got some better ones out there and the Shure 44's are pretty solid. Comparable to this, IMO, are a few of the NuMarks but I'd actually rate them a cut above. And if you're into the good sound, check out some of the Grado's. Regardless, you're not gonna get a primo sounding cartridge on the cheap so sometimes with these you get what you pay for in terms of sound quality. For beginners, maybe check this out. Audiophiles looking to enjoy a good album may be disappointed.This one doesn't come with a headshell, etc. so you're on your own there. Just got the screws, etc."
1,Shafted,"I bought a pair of these cartridges only to find out that they didn't include needles. Normally, I wouldn't have a problem with that, but since they are advertised with needles (see picture above), I found this to be a problem. And like the previous reviewer said, the advertised version comes with a velvet interior which would provide better protection during shipment. But all I got was some hard plastic and cracked cartridges. I am now in the middle of fighting for a refund. Let the buyer beware."
4,Functional for a reasonable price,This is not a bad deal for $21.00. I use this to hold Gamma Quick Kids 36' Tennis Balls. This holds about 50 - 60 of the red tennis balls for kids.It was easy to assemble but there were a bunch of washers left over?It is a good idea to have some cable ties and a velcro strap...the cable ties are to hold the basket together at the base and the velcro strap is for the lid.I am not sure how long the the plastic tubing/air hose on the handles will last.
2,The legs are hard to lock into the prop-up position,"I bought this one after my previous ball hopper broke. This replacement is reasonably priced, but you got what you paid for. For me the major drawback is that to lock the legs into the prop-up position, you have to push them pretty hard into those locking tabs--I have to put them down on their side on the ground and use both hands to push them in.Another thing is that the basket is held together with screws (you have to put them together yourselves with those screws, so some DIY involved). I don't mind the self-assembly part--many products do these days. The issue is that there are no locking washers included--two of the screws already become loose and I have to tighten them again. I am afraid that one of these days they will become loose again and be lost (my wife and kids also use it, and they may not pay attention to these details)."
4,Good Buy,"Product is a good buy for the price.""Some Assembly Required"", but not in the way I usually fear. Just a few nuts and bolts, and the only tool required is included.My only complaint is that the lid doesn't lock closed, which was an issue since I leave it laying sideways (the only way it will fit) in my car trunk, hence balls everywhere. A short bungee cord remedied that.In all, I've seen better, but it does the job, and the price is great."
2,This is NOT the Best Ballhopper,"I bought this ballhopper because it was the #1 selling ballhopper on Amazon. I just returned it.1) It does NOT hold 75 balls. Maybe it hold 65 but as balls come in cases of 72 it ended up with 8-10 balls rolling around the back of my SUV.2) During assembly the ""caps"" popped off all four ""capped nuts"" leaving four open ended side bars that did their best to rip up the carpet in my cargo area.3) It is VERY hard to pop the legs in locking slots when using the unit as a stand.4) Because it didn't hold 75 balls, the top would never stay shut. I had to use a twist tie.Just ordered the Gamma 75 Gold and that seems to be a much better unit. Check it's page in a few days for a review."
1,tennis ball hopper,"Bought tennis hopper, one week after use the welds on the arms broke on one side, now it is useless. Weak link is the welds."
5,Terrific!,"This is one high quality apron and the price is unbeatable. Great coverage, the pockets are a nice touch, the stitching is perfect, the fabric is nice and sturdy, washes great. Love it! I'll be getting more of these!"
5,An eye opener for the Public School 'educated' masses.,Anyone who cares to learn a little about how the biggest mafia in this country operates should read this. I can testify as to the veracity of this book for I am part of the mafia myself.
2,Not worth it,There was only one or two songs that was o.k. & the rest I did not enjoy at all. I guess I was expecting to hear fast/thrash metal & this cd lacks it completely.
1,not for ADOBE DREAMWEAVER this is different.,I ordered this DVD because it says it covers things I did not cover in class for Dreamweaver. But this is not for the popular program Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 or Dreamweaver creative suites. This is for some program I have never heard of also called Dreamweaver made by Macromedia it is not the same as adobe dreamweaver. I have never seen anyone use this program. It is not for the popular program made by adobe. SO beware. this is not for ADOBE DREAMWEAVER.
3,Not as Bad as some..,"...I have seen much, much worse. It is kind of a weak story but it has some erotic content. Be it a Prison and all. It was a fair movie and not bad to have around."
5,A real surprise,"This album is new material, and it sounds wonderful. I had sworn off any more Collin's compliations, and this was a real surprise. It's heart felt, too. In some previous albums, her terrific saprano belted away emotion, but not here; this is really one of the best things she has given us in a long time. Avoid the spoken word tract, everyting else is a gem."
1,Do not buy APEX,"I got this TV delivered and it does'nt work right. Apex has the worst customer service. Try reaching their 866-4APEXGO number its always busy, try their 909-930-1239 you get to talk to a rude customer service representative after 35 minutes hold. Bottom line - TV does'nt work and teh manufacturer would'nt help fix it. DO NOT BUY APEX."
5,Fantastic polish,"I been using this stuff for 10 years, and it brings very nice finishes for your clear coat. It doesnt require much buffering, and its shinny once after the haze. The hazing only takes a few minutes, and then can be removed after. Don't use it on the regular unpainted plastics."
5,Wouldn 't use anything else,"I""ve found after many years of using this product best results are acheived by doing small sections at a time, like haif of hood or a fender or a door. For best results appy to a section, let haze about 5 minutes then wipe off. Immediatly reaply to same section as before for a smooth and ultimate shine. I hope this helps with this great product. My vehicles look like the day I bought them. 2007 nissan frontier and2011 Honda Pilot."
4,"Nice shine, easy to apply, but...","Nu Finish gives your car a nice shine, it is easy to apply and remove. On the plus side it can be applied in direct sunlight (no sweating in the garage) and gives a nice shine. The down side is that if it gets on anything black plastic (My corolla has black door handles, mirors and door trim) it turns it a white color. I found another product called ""Mequiar's Cleaner Wax"" that works well to remove the white smears, but it is still a pain. You should be extra carefull around plastic when using this product."
1,"Terrible, Dishonest Description","Do not be fooled! This is NOT a complete collection of Dickens' work. In fact, it is only a very, very thick and very expensive copy of ""Bleak House"". Very deceptive of the publisher to entitle this ""Charles Dickens' Complete Works"". Returned the book right away. Do not buy!"
1,hard to access seperate parts,I found that it was virtually impossible to find individual stories since there is no index or table of contents.
3,"Ebooks of public domain material will, I hope, someday be better proofread.","There's no point in critiquing Dickens in this forum. I love his work, but am dismayed that the level of proofreading found in ebooks in the public domain is so universally low. This edition is no exception, in spite of the fact that it is not free. It's been spellchecked, but there's some little mistake or other on nearly every page I've read so far. Will press on nonetheless for the sake of having all this material available on a portable gadget."
1,Kinda disapointed.,"Let me start off by saying that I love the Death Note series, and have seen the first 2 seasons.Having said that, this DVD is nothing but rehashed footage from those first 2 seasons, compacted into a less than 2 hour movie.If you havn't seen the first couple seasons you may like the movie, but it might not seem to make sense in parts, and even if you have seen the first 2 seasons, the edit job to make both seasons into a ""movie"" didn't do them justice.To recap.Love Death Note,Don't like this DVD."
5,Effective,Works immediately and well. The only thing I would change is to have a quieter spray. Febreeze bottles have a quieter spray and I wish the manufacturers of M9 would offer an alternative bottle that sprays with less conspicuous noise.
4,One good book,this book is very good although it may make you cry at the end. This book is good for all ages. I like the humor that Freak (Kevin) has. My favorite part is probably when it's at the 4th of July. Every chapter takes place in a different area. There's a little bit of violence in the story.
4,Freak the Mighty,Freak the mighty is about a little kid who is disabled and he can't do anythging for himseldf and he meets this guy who is really big and is also an oiutcast. They kind fo become friends until they day Freak dies. Which is a very inmportant day to everyone
3,"Great story, not great audio sound","I use this with students. The audio is not of the best quality, and it's hard to hear. The narrator does a great job of sounding sullen, but he uses such a quiet voice. I DO highly recommend the book though."
3,Freak the Mighty,"Freak the Might is a good book about two kids that become friends. BUT Freak, has a disease that he knows will kill him in the end. Max's father went to jail for killing his wife; Max's mom. He was supposed to serve 30 years, but he only served 9! When Max found out that his father was coming, he went crazy. When he went to sleep, he was kidnapped by his very own father. But Freak being the smart kid that he is found out. Freak had gone to where Max was being held, and called the cops. Right when Max was in a fight with his father, yelling at him: ""I SAW YOU KILL HER! I SAW YOU! I SAW YOU TRY TO TAKE THE AIR AWAY FROM HER!!!!!!"" That is exactly what Killer Kane, Max's dad tried to do to Loretta Lee. Freak came right in time to save Max's life. He had a squirt gun with Vinegar, salt, and chilly pepper. But he had said that it was some type of acid. The cops came to arrest killer Kane for attempt of Murder to Loretta Lee. Involved in all this action, Freaks heart just gave out on him."
4,The best book I have ever read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The Mighty just felt like it came out at me. I can't wait till the movie comes out. The story is about two boys named Max and Freak. They Always go on adventures. I hate When Max get kiddnapped by his dad. I felt sorry at the end for the for the fair gwen of air and Max at the end. If you want to know what happen read the book. Out of all the book I read {alot} that had to be the best book iv'e read
5,Best Book Alive,"Freak the Mighty is an awsome book. It has a bunch of humorous and sad scenes. The part of it that I especially liked was when Max had the squirt gun full of soap, vinegar, and curry powder and he made Killer Kane think his eyes were burning up. Freak the Mighty has a really cool dictionary that Freak wrote. If I were to rank the book, I would give it four stars because it is very tradedous but adventourous. If you like action books, then this is the book for you. Freak the Mighty is one of the best books I have ever read, so I encourage you to read it."
5,WHAT A BOOK,ITS A VERYY WELL WRITTEN BOOK THAT OPENS YOUR EYES TO THE WORLD OVER AND OVER AGAIN ITS AMAZING A MUST READ NO A MUST BUY I TELL YOU ITS AMAZING!!BY NICK YOUNG !!PEACE OUT!!
2,it was bad,"My opinion was that this is a bad book. It was about this little dwarf kid that has this disiese that makes him small, what he lacks in body size he makes up in brain size, he is very smart. There is also this big kid with disease that makes him huge what he has in body size he lacks in brain capacity. Together they play around doing imaginary things and having fun, together they are freak the mighty. But really the disease that is in the dwarf kid (freak) is taking over his body and eventually he dies at the end in the hospitol."
1,freak the mighty,"Freak the mighty is a kind of boring book where a big mentally challenged person and a midget nerd make friends.They make friends and become a team.My favorite partwas Christmas Eve but the rest of the book wasn't that good , but that is just my opinion."
1,freak the mighty,the book was in awful condition.the booked was written in from front to back with lots of notes and profanity.it was hard to focus on the book because of all the writing
3,what I thought about Freak the mighty,"I think that ""Freak The Mighty"" Was an okay book, but it's not something I would generally pick to read. It was a good book though. I think it was great how Max and Kevin playedplayed off each others weaknesses to make up for what they didn't have or needed. It was good how they helped each other.I liked the book though because it was funny. It also showed that no matter how diffrent to people are, you can get along. It showed that even people who are diffrent need friends. I liked how diffrent Max and Kevin were, but became best friends.it also shows that oppisites do attract."
4,freak the mighty,this book was about a boy named max who meets a crippled boy.they go on adventures together so they call there self freak the mighty.but one day max's dad killer kane broke in and took max.so freak saved max by finding them in an abanded building ....i recommend this book to anyone.and my favorite character was max.
4,Freak The Mighty,"The book I read was 'Freak The Mighty' and the book was a very good book for all ages.Maxwell and Kevin are the main characters.Maxwell Kane is a big,dumb,slow,gaint ,at least that's what kid's thought at his school.Kevin as problems to.Kevin is small ,very smart,and he is slow like Max.Kevin is disabled in a few ways.One of Kevin's probles is a small.Kevin's body is getting to small for his inner body peaces.this book is very good until the ending.Read the book you will like it I promise."
2,Chris said this book is boring,I think this is one of the boring s books I have ever read I did not like this book.Im thinking of buying Max the mighty see if its bad like this one.Butthe sad part about this book was the little kid freak died and that made freaks friend Max sad.
4,~*~Reviewing My Mind~*~,"I liked the book because its interesting when Freak (Kevin) and Max go on journeys together. You could say that they are best friends. Freak gets his name because he has braces on his legs. He's like this boy genius and Max...well...he's not the smartest person in the world! He's a large framed ordinary kid and Freak is this small 4-foot genius.I don't like the book because it's just boring in the very beginning and then it in the middle it starts to get a little interesting. But the end is the best part. That's where all the action is. But even though it has a lot of action, it's sad. But you'll have to read the book to figure out what I'm talking about."
5,Don't Judge a child by their Appearince,"I am a 12 year old chid,and I recently read ,""Freak the Mighty"". I thought it was a wonderful book that every ""young adult"" should read. It teaches that you should try to see what a person thinks,not how they look. I believe that the author of this book was an awesome writer and this SHOULD recieve an award for the grief and soul they put into this book."
2,It was just............wierd,"Okay, this book was short but long. It didn't really interest me. It was just wierd. ONe minute the character is talking about this and the other minute he's talking about something else! This book was a kind of book where'd you go ""What's the point of this book?"" ""What is the author trying to tell me?"" I didn't really like it. I could hardly stay up reading it! And the bad thing was I was assigned to read this so It really didn't interest me. I tried getting into the book, but It wasn't interesting. But I guess it was alright to me."
3,~*~Darlene's Review~*~,"The book, Freak The Mighty was pretty good. I liked it because Freak (Kevin) was always making up some kind of journey. Max was always hanging out with Freak. You could say that they were best friends.Freak is called that particular name because he has braces on his legs, and everyone thinks he's retarded or something. But really he's a boy genius! He knows everything there is to know about...well...almost everything! He even says words that his teacher don't know! On the other hand, there's Max. Not the smartest person in the world! Basically, Freak talks like he's some sort of scientist or something and Max has no idea what he's talking about! So of course, Freak has to explain to him almost every word he says.I don't like the book because the beginning is not all that interesting. It's basically at the end where all the action is, but other than that, it was pretty ok!"
3,Freak The Mighty Review,The book Freak the Mighty was not the best book was not the worst book. If I had a choice I persnoly would not read it. It had some exicting parts and some not
2,ok but not great,I thought Freak the Mighty was an ok book. It could have been a litte more exciting. the book was over rated it was not as good as I thought it was going to be. The one good thing about is that Max the main charecter makes a best friend. He helps him with his schoolwork and helps him to get better grade. To now the ending you have to read the book.
4,A MIGHTY GOOD LESSON,"FREAK THE MIGHTY IS A GOOD BOOK BECAUSE IT TELLS YOU HOW TO DEAL WITH TOUGH ISSUES. IT IS A FUNNY, HEART-WARMING, AND SAD STORY. THE BOOK WAS KIND OF HARD TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IT WAS BEING TOLD THROUGH A PERSONS THOUGHTS AND EXPERIENCES. I LIKED THE BOOK BECAUSE IT WAS INTERESTING. IT WAS CLEVER HOW THE AUTHOR MADE THE STORY SEEM TO BE A TRUE EXPERIENCE."
1,Couldn't get past the horrible inaccuracies,"I realize that this is a moive. Unless it's written by someone in the field, you need to take the technical aspects with a grain of salt. But there were just way too many problems with this movie. It starts off with the title. Ground Control? That wasn't even a part of the movie. It might have actually been decient if they spent some money and hired a consultant."
5,Great Fates CD,"This is a great CD. Completely different from all other Fates Warning CDs. This was my first Fates Cd back in 1989, and I still listen to it. This is more metal than progressive, but the songs are amazing. Arch does sound great on this CD, much better than on the earlier CD's. And the guitar playing of Matheos and Aresti is, as always, impeccable. I also recommend Perfect Symmetry as my favorite FW cd in the progressive/Ray Alder era. DO NOT GET INSIDE OUT! It is terrible. Even the band members have admitted it is an embarrassing cd."
1,Speakon Cable,"This is not a Bridge-Mono cable as the add might lead you to believe. It is a regular mono cable, as opposed to a stereo cable."
4,"Light hearted, nonsensical fun romp","My first introduction to Beverly Lynne. It certainly won't be my last. She is a drop dead gorgeous woman, dressed or undressed. While she's not the BEST in acting ability, I have seen far worse. The script could have been better written, and the special effects were hokey, but if you don't expect too much, (besides lots of nudity, and after all why else would you be buying this), you won't be disappointed."
5,"So far, So good","I just placed my order for this wonderul television yesterday morning. I spent a week going through all the reviews and all information I could find about this tv. Everything sounds so wonderful and at 1329.00 I can't really go wrong. I'll see in a few days. I will update once it's here.***update***02/17/04 I ordered this TV on 02/13/04. Already shipping late, according to order status it still hasn't shipped. The product page advised that it ships in 24 hrs. We'll see how much longer it takes."
5,Simply delightful!,"I picked this up just after Christmas because I wanted to re-read ""A Christmas Carol."" The two additional stories, ""The Chimes"" and ""The Cricket on the Hearth,"" were new to me although I've read nearly all of the Dickens novels. Delightful! The usual Dickens themes - how human love and goodness can triumph over the evils of poverty, indifference, and avarice - abound. The characters are memorable and colorful, exaggerated yet poignantly familiar. What a great way to wind up the holiday season."
3,Condensing Leaves A Lot,To be desired and is unfortunate. I suggest you not let this book be your only example of Charles Dickens' rich writing.
2,Don't judge them by this CD,I bought and love almost all of Goldfingers releases and I actually regret getting this one. Let me break this down for you. They start out by saying how much they hate somebody then they change it up a bit and say how much they hate somebody else. Throw in a few more songs about how much they hate everybody and you've got this CD. If you're pissed off at the world then I guess you can identify with this CD.
3,nothing special,"Goldfinger is very pro social, vegitarians , no guns ,Dont like Ted Nugnet. It makes this album interesting but it was nothing specail for me. It provided time to pass by in the car but nothing else FTN was funny but crude in the same way , alot of the songs were this way.Happy is one of my favorite songs on the CD but in the backround the band goes du du du du du du which takes away from the song , i think. This is a good CD but dont expect a whole lot from it."
2,what happened?,After picking up their ST cd after hearing my buddies copy a million times I picked up Stomping Ground. Both were totally awsome discs. Then I picked up Hang-Ups after falling in love with Superman while playing Tony Hawk. Then I pick OYE. It was a total let-down and far too preachy with the vegan message. A few of the songs are worth picking up on the internet but all in all don't waste your money.
3,300,"This was purchased as a gift for a family member. I cannot personally rate this product, but the member that received it really enjoyes it."
3,Good Movie!!,I purchased this movie for my hearing impaired father only to discover that it is not closed captioned. The movie is great but it would have been nice if I could share it with my father.
1,Legendary battle. Corny movie.,"This movie is more than disappointing. It dishonors the legend of the 300 Spartans.And, no, Spartans did not throw babies from a cliff, for whatever reason. Archaeologists have excavated in Sparta for a long while and have never found a baby's skeleton.Google on these words for more truth: sparta reconsidered"
4,300,"I thought the film was very good as it had a kind of ""mystical"" qualiity that tranferred the viewer to another dimension that maybe (or not) we would not mind living in.The story line iteslf was accurate on the basics of the historical narrative but also the producers did take some liberties in order to enhance the overall context. I do not recall that the priests of the oracle were anywhere near the evil ugly beings that the film suggested....the Spartans were a religious community ...no need to demonize their beliefs.I did not realize that the king was Gerard Butler...I thought he did a great job. Lina Heady was also good however I think she has been type cast into this type of genre.Overall, the film was quite artistic and very good for people who enjoy this type of adventure."
3,History written by the Spartans,"You really have to go into this film with the mindset that the story is being told from the Spartan viewpoint. I will give it 3 stars for some of the battle sequences, but it's hard to get passed how poorly the Persian Empire was portrayed. I see a lot of people dismissing this as ""just entertainment"" and such, but's there was certainly an agenda being force fed to the audience here. The Persians were shown as mutants who lured in a traitor with the promise of sex and riches...while the Spartans are always depicted as fierce warriors in the name of ""freedom."" I can't pan it with 1 star simply due to the nice screenplay, however, the political agenda was laughably easy to detect."
4,What a great movie!,"Im not going to sit here and give this movie a five. To me, five stars means its flawless and nowadays its hard to find a film with that kind of flow and plus I have my negatives. On a brighter note, first off the special effects are freaking outstanding! Second, character development is surely here. I mean the main charcter just continues to become a ruthless S.O.B. Finally the story line is pretty dam cool especially considering how it ends. Im not gonna spoil it...you have to see this flick and make sure the volume's all the way up!"
3,Blue-Ray needs to step up,"First off, the movie is great and it's one of those movies that must be seen in theatres or at least in HD/Blue-Ray to truly appreciate. It's gorgeous to look at and the action sucks you into the movie.My comments are more about the Blue-Ray format for this movie and in general. I feel Sony needs to step up and give us a bit more for the money. There are two-discs versions and super duper reextended quadruple edited versions of this film and many others. But when it comes to the Blue-Ray, nothing. Not even an insert in the case with the chapters, film info, actors, nothing. For the money we pay for these movies, I think they can put a little more content into the discs and the packaging. Blue-Ray should be a step up from normal DVD and even HD so, make me feel like I'm stepping up. Give me the content in the disc and in the case."
5,One of the Best Collector's Editions EVER!!!!,"I have at my private stash of DVD'd close to 1,100 movies so far...and this is, hands-down, one of the best collector's editions I've seen! The value/buck here is incredible!"
5,One of the stalwart Epics of our time,"Not a whole lot to say about this movie--other than there is nothing more visually impressive, emotionally stunning and legendary in violence and Historical RECREATION than this movie about the battle of Thermopylae. By far Gerard Butler's best movie, it is well known this is also a fictitious graphic-comic adaptation so there is a whole lot of Hollywood license being taken, but i think it is still one of the best Epics of all time and one of the best movies I've seen since Gladiator."
5,Color is awesome,"Compared to DVD, 300 is 300 times better in Blu Ray. So crisp you can see the sweat comming from the pores on the spartans. Excellent buy especially for the money. You just can't beat this price on amazon"
3,"Good Story, Horrible Visuals","""300"" tells the amazing story of how an informal Spartan army of only 300 men held off the massive Persian military force until they were betrayed by an exiled Spartan and decimated by King Xerxes. The story was incredible, and told very well. Several of the battle sequences really whet the appetite of the armchair war tactical strategist. But the flat, fake, chrome-like colors of the film (which make this almost look like a comic book), really take away from the experience. The slow-motion photography also detracts from the credibility of the film - I can only guess that this technique was used to simulate a 3D effect, which it accomplished to a certain degree, but not enough to make this movie visually appealing. Also, the ""look"" they chose for King Xerxes was awful! From the research I've done on this individual, I don't believe the costume to be historical - perhaps this was just another of the filmmaker's surreal visuals for shock value?"
2,"For the few, the loud who do not go beyond the realm of Cliff Notes","Having seen the 1962 film,""300 Spartans"",and though a comic book admirer, this newer, graphic comic-take on the last stand satisfies only modestly. Both films share a fictional rendition, though ""300"" has a unique visual stamp to its efforts. Adding gratuitous sexcapades for the modern porn-inclined audience was degrading to its dramatic efforts, including the British accents and preposterous ""M-lords"" scattered throughout.Yet the most inventive use of slo-motion in action film to date allowed the viewer to savor the synchronized movements of the brave lads as a unit or separately to absorb the weaponry tailored for the daring close combat.The acting was superior to the daytime soap screenplay;and despite the autodesk re-created Pompeiian town in detail, the film never makes an attempt to wrap the action in historicity. The History channel's ""Last Stand of the 300"" is the real take on this incident."
5,"A ""cinematic"" must have in your film collection!","If you like ""gangsta"", this is the one. Love the Earthquake quote...""sire, it's an earthquake"" and I think the lead actor replied something to the effect of it being a battle cry. LOVE IT! The film was seductively visual, the hero kicked butt until the last drop...."
2,i want my 20 dollars back!,"wow this was with out a doubt the single most boring film of the year.bad story, bad fights (too much Cgi blood), predictable ending. they should have cut about 30 minutes of the movie cuz it just drags on and on.if you dont have a brain and you like movies that will make you fall asleep check out this one"
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"I watched it last night and thought that it was a waste of time. If you liked Gladiator with its sense of realism, you won't like this movie. I sure didn't. Its just like watching a comic book."
3,Assault by the Persians.... Assault on the senses,"This is a gorgeously shot movie. It will take you in on scenery alone.But... It is no Gladiator. It is no Braveheart. It is no Sin City.Honestly, the slow mo cuts got old, and the pacing was varied. I found the History Channel treatment of the real events (including more than just a passing scene on the naval strategics) to be a much more satisfying and interesting story.If you do not have the aforementioned titles, get them first. They are more deserving of the money. If you feel you must have this movie, I suggest you buy used, or if you need to show off your HD display or new HD player, get the HD version. I am sure it's magnificent to look at."
3,"Good Movie, Crappy 'Special' Features","300 is an awesome action movie but the Special Features on this disc are very disappointing. The 'Making Of' Featurette is only 5 minutes long. The 'Making 300 in Images' was just a bunch of film pieced together at a high speed. It relayed no actual information and made my eyes hurt.Buy the movie, but don't expect much from the 2nd disc."
5,Blu-Ray kicks a**!!!,This movie is just AWSOME! I had seen it on dvd and image quality on a 1080p hdmi tv is just incredible. Plus sound is masterfull. I loved it.
3,BEWARE: grainy picture!,"I love 300 as much as the next person, but buyer beware, because of artistic choices by the director, the picture on this DVD is extremely grainy. It is not the fault of the format, but the director. It doesn't look bad on standard def, but the picture gets exposed on HD-DVD, making the most visually stunning movie to come out in years a marginal-looking HD-DVD at best. Also, if you buy a Toshiba A3 HD-DVD player, the HD-DVD version of 300(NOT the HD-DVD/DVD combo) comes free (also with Bourne Identity).Just be warned... this seems like it is a must-own for HD-DVD, but if you were planning on using it to show off the clear, stunning picture of your HD-DVD player to your friends, you (and they) will be massively disappointed.Some people may not mind the graininess, but I for one payed big bucks for a HD-DVD player, TV, and movie so it would look clear, NOT grainy!"
4,"Visually stunning and good action, but not for everyone","This is not, and was never meant to be, a historically accurate version of the 300 Spartans. While it is based on an actual event, it is an adaptation of a graphic novel version of the story. If you are looking for accuracy or a documentary this is not it. If you are looking for an action movie with great visuals, good fight sequences, and good (but certainly not great) acting, you will probably find this to be entertaining. Personally I think the best performances in the movie come from Dominic West and Lena Headey. If you are looking for movie that is an accurate representation of the Battle of Thermopylae pass this by, but if you are looking for a good action movie that looks and sounds great on Blu Ray, then this will be a good addition to your collection."
2,A Turkey,"It would have been useful if someone had said not to buy it if you are over 25, though I think it is really pitched to 17-year olds. The speech at the end was rousing, but otherwise it ranged from mediocre to cartoonish most of the time. And by that I don't mean the special effects, but the level of the story."
1,Racist,This movie is one of the most racist films I have ever seen. I would give it 0 stars if I could.
1,Thanks to those of you who don't fall for the hype,"Thanks for this heads-up. I don't hold out much hope for these Hollywood fake historical dramas. They are just pumped up good guy-bad guy Axis-of-Evil propaganda imposed on ancient history, which is completely ridiculous. The last decent Greek epic Hollywood ever made was ""Clash of the Titans"" back around 1980. I just stopped paying attention to all the hype."
3,Not worth the HD cost,"The first movie I watched on our new HDTV. What a disappointment! I kept thinking that the picture was nowhere near as nice as I was expecting and had seen in stores, etc. The problem was not my equipment, but the ""style"" of the film. For theatrical effect, the picture has the appearance of having been filmed through very slightly frosted glass. This technique, whatever, causes the background to appear as if there is considerable noise in the signal (not ""snow"", but not a steady background). Very strange. The features on the DVD are filmed normally, and look terrific...On to the story. This is a film adaptation of a COMIC BOOK. The gratuitous nudity, and splattering blood ad nauseum are completely expected once you know the original medium. It is too bad, as the story is actually a pretty good one but gets too mired in the over-the-top gore to match the excellence of films such as Gladiator.Worth watching once. Not worth owning."
3,not bad,"Nice computer compositing work.The action was OK. But one would have hoped they read the Iliad, which has greek warfare scenes that make 300 look G-rated. One would have hoped that they watched the 7Samurai or read Outlaws of the Marsh - both stories have more more entertaining depictions of asymetrical warfare. One would have hope the film makers had watched Richard the 3rd. etc.The film makers seem to have been inspired by football. SO if you like foot ball, and wish that football players had to charge head to head with elephants... youre in luck.In the past Iranian Americans have dealt with racist anti-Iranian paranoia by referring to themselves as persian. But 300 makes ""Persian"" sound like ""gay goblin"" - so now Iranian Americans are calling themselves Iranian Americans. almost funny."
2,All blood No Plot,"blood Blood Blood Blood Blood blood Blood blood blood Blood Blood bllod Blood blood Rape blood Blood Blood Blood blood Blood, that basically sums up this generic mindless Blood Bath movie. All violznce, No Plot, laughable Fake acting."
2,Bad Transfer,"I have noticed that many scenes have a lot of flickering which detract from the movie experience. Unfortunately this effect does not appear to be confined to me, searching the net has displayed many other people experiencing this issue. I am starting to believe that this issue is due to a bad transfer and not a hard ware issue. I would NOT buy this disc, wait till they resolve it."
3,"not bad, not great either","i thought this movie was gonna be great, it has some great effects and its really different from most war movies, they have done a good job on the fighting scenes, but what i didnt like at all was the way they showed persians, persians didnt dress that way in wars and they werent bisexuals, if any of you have seen the movie alexander then you will understand what i mean about the persians,but if you just like te wars and the gore and to see some cool mutants then its a good movie for you"
2,Grainy,Great price but a bad transfer. The picture is very grainy for a modern Blu Ray rendition of a rather popular movie.
5,AWESOME,I love this movie its filmed in an interesting way its based on historical happenings the guys are hunky and hardcore . Totally get it.
3,Only Butler acts well. Good director.,This film is a about a great director and 1 good actor. Butler is great as usual. The rest of the casts tries but unfortunately their trying can be seen. They are simply not natural and lack the charisma. The director's shots are simply stunning. He is going places.
2,300 is just way too long and too much,Caption says it all. It was loud. Had some amazing stuff. But that's it.enuf said.
4,Awesome Looking Blu Ray dics,I've just started collecting BR's right after I bought my PS3 and I wish I had been purchasing them sooner. I also have the standard dvd of this movie and the difference between dvd and br is phenomenal. Blu Ray FTW!
2,Great Movie...Terrible Blu-Ray Transfer.,"I love the movie, but the video quality of this blu-ray transfer was the worst I have seen so far. I played it through my PS3 on my new 61"" Samsung DLP (1080p) and had constant digital noise flickering. I love the Blue-Ray format, but this is a terrible example of the new technology."
1,Although I generally believe that the less said about 300...,"...the better, I do feel obligated to say a few things about 300's self-aggrandizing disquisitions. To organize my discussion, I suggest that we take one step back in the causal chain and embark on a new path towards change. What I mean to say is that I have a tendency to report the more sensational things that 300 is up to, the more shocking things, things like how it wants to call evil good and good evil. And I realize the difficulty that the average person has in coming to grips with that, but while it insists that we have no reason to be fearful about the criminally violent trends in our society today and over the past ten to fifteen years, reality dictates otherwise. Actually, if you want a real dose of reality, look at how as far as being namby-pamby is concerned, none of 300's devotees holds a candle to it. Do I blame society for this? No, I blame 300."
2,Not my cup of tea,"This is almost like a comic. If you like SIN CITY then you will probably like this as it is a similar style.To me it lacked a decent plot, nice scenery shoots and good acting these guys were like statutes."
5,300 the film,"this is a great movie.based on actual events,this movie is approximately correct(there were 300 or so spartans,but they were joined by other greek supporters which brought the numbers to around 1000-1500...still,considering they fought against 150-200,000 persians,this still a monumental achievement).the photography/cinematography is outstanding...incredible battle scenes...the scenes almost look like ballet...incredible to watch..."
2,Good Movie Terrible Transfer Quality,"First this is a pretty good movie, especially if you like action movies with a fare amount of gore. My low review of this film comes not from the quality of the movie but rather from the poor quality of the encoding and transfer to Blu-ray. This is NOT how blue ray is supposed to look. The clarity is very poor and barely above DVD quality. Unfortunately many Blue-ray and HD-DVD movies are like this and I am getting very tired of paying $10-20 bucks more for a movie that is only marginally better visually. I encourage you to save your money and buy the DVD version."
4,Grainy,"It does not look like other blue ray movies, it dit not look that great as expected, overall the movie is great."
5,Outstanding,"Looks absolutely perfect, sounds absolutely perfect. Definitely a nice upgrade from the standard DVD version of the film and worth the extra money for this version of it. Despite the gritty film style of the movie, the high-definition versions of it have a clarity and crispness that in my opinion really add to the graphic novel feel of the film.Very happy with the purchase. If you have a Blu-Ray player, you owe it to yourself to have this movie in your library."
1,Turn off the audio,"Visually very interesting with innovative special effects. Occasionally over the top creature design. Cool to look at, but the script is terrible. The script was written and spoken with modern day language that doesn't match the time period. Disappointed."
1,Junk Movie,"I was very excited to see this movie with all the hype and hysteria around it. Knowing that it was not historically accurate I at least expected something entertaining, good cinematography or interesting images. I was left feeling...empty. This was a waste of money and time. I usually donate movies that I have watched and tired of or movies that I don't like. In this case I broke the disk and threw it in the trash."
3,Was not that impressed with the blu-ray,"The grain that was intended for this film is a distraction in this high definition, blu-ray release. The reviewer who refers to pixels blinking in the background is pretty spot on. About 1/3rd of this reveals the gorgeous color palette in HD that you would expect and the rest of the movie on the disc can be disconcerting by comparison.Just an FYI to folks who are looking to upgrade from the regular DVD, you may be disappointed. I'm a pretty big advocate of blu-ray, but not so much for this particular release."
5,Got Rifles,"Rifles for Watie is about Jeff Bussey a sixteen year old farm boy from Kansas. This story takes place in the Ozarks region(Kansas, Missouri, Olkahoma, and Arkansas). Jeff's family gets ""bushwacked"" by Confederate bushwackers and because of it Jeff joins the Union Army. Jeff thinks war would be fun so he's excited to be in his first battle. But when friends die in the battle Jeff changes his thoughts about war. He finds out that war means destruction and killing. I think Rifles for Watie deserves a five because I think it was well written, took place in a very important American historical event, and it has a wonderful plot. I compare this book to War in the Ozarks. It takes place in the same region as Rifles for Watie, and it has about the same plot. Rifles for Watie was a extremely exciting and excellent book."
5,You will never need anything else. TRUST ME!,"This product was recommended to by someone over 10 years ago ( I cannot remember who). All I know is that when I was younger, I would get gel nails/acrylic nails and whatever else. Since then (10 years) and after purchasing this product, my nails grew very very long to the point of never needing a thing but polish. I actually had to constantly cut them. Trust me when I say that once you use this product for about a month, you wouldnt put crap on your nails ever again. Now, my nails are strong, long, and hardly break. All you need is patience and this polish and you cant buy patience, but you CAN give this product a try. IT WORKS!"
3,As far back as I go.......,"Having discovered Fates Warning after their Pleasant Shade of Grey CD, I started working my way backwards in the long list of releases they have put out. When I listen to this one, it seems that they are trying to bridge the gap between heavy metal and progressive showing very different sounds on different tracks. What I find is a CD that has a few good tunes and some that don't really come off well. Ray Alder pushes his raw talent to the brink while trying to scream out lyrics slightly above his range and some of the songs just don't gel with the complicated drums Mark Zonder tries to add to them. I think if you like APSOG, Parallels, and Inside Out, that this CD may not appeal to you. If you like the stuff before it, you might think it's the greatest. Pursue at your own risk."
1,Tried to return after 17 days unsucessfully - 33% success rate while recording.,"1 disk recorded fine, second disk could not finalize, and recorder would freeze up. Had to remove battery to restore. Third recording attempt (3rd disk) I continued to get disk errors, and had to wait minutes for recovery. No I wasn't jumping up and down, I was highly stationary.Software/Hardware doesn't allow for easy recorded data transfer to hard drive (USB). Data capture of recorded data crashed about 70% through every attempt (USB). Gave up an copied from mini DV through DVD burner.Tried to return for exchange or money back, but Best Buy would not accommodate the request - 3 days after the return policy. I feel like I have a expensive peice of junk - Samsung will only service it. I really don't want this product, and wouldn't recommed it - obviously based on experience."
4,1/2-inch Shank Master Dado Set,"I recently purchased this set on sale and have used many of the bits. It comes in handy when using them for baltic birch, plywood and MDF dados that are rarely the ""standard"" size. It has a +1/32"" bit and a -1/32"" bit for the standard wood sizes of 1/2"" and 3/4"", and a +1/32"" and a -1/64"" for the 1/4"" size. They may not be the quality that you would want or need for production work, but for modest use, the price and quality is unbeatable."
1,very disappointed,"I learned my lesson. I will never buy anything from apex again. I bought a 43in.Apex projection tv the second day the tv went to a double vision. I called the apex company,and they told me they were gonna find a technician. There's no techician in this area for apex tvs. They're suppose to send me a new tv in two weeks and i haven't recieved andthing yet it been four weeks now and no tv my next step is to go to 7 on your side and see if they can get anything accomplished.I received my tv on 9-2-2003.It wont let you rate the tv i rate it a 0 i had to put in 1"
2,ASK Before Buy,"I recently purchased this from REDIFORM believing that it was a ten pack as indicated in the figure, paid almost $9 for sipping and handling and received a BIG BOX with just one booklet. TOTAL RIPOFF. When contacted the seller, they put all the blame in Amazon and I am not getting the other nine!"
3,Angle Schlesser perfume,This was purchased as a gift and was not the exact scent she wanted so my evaluation reflects that. She seems to like the one she got but not as good as the one she wanted.
4,Not too shabby,"Wendy has done a very nice job of introducing HTML to the average person. What might seem like technical mumbo-jumbo to most people, becomes very clear with this book. I hadn't used HTML in years, and this book served me well as a refresher course."
1,Where's the country??,"Somebody at work heard I liked country music and gave me this because they didn't want it. How in the heck is this country?? It's just unimaginative, outdated, pop music with a little fiddle and banjo trimming. [Shaking head in dismay.] Some people should change and find some roots; I'm putting this dud in the garage sale box."
5,Some People Change,Quick on shipping and was exactly what the seller stated very pleased with this person. And would highly recommend them and purchase from them again.
5,My kind of music,"I adore this CD. The song What DoYou Say AboutThat mirrors many of my own attitudes. There are a great many people today who think it is their business what their neighbors drive or what color their house is painted. It ain't none of their darn business. If people spent as much effort taking care of their own business and staying out of their neighbors business, it would be a much nicer world."
5,SOME PEOPLE CHANGE....THE BEST CD,"I have listened to the CD over and over. I love it. I think its the best they've done so far. If you like Montgomery Gentry, this is a must buy CD. There isn't one song that I don't like. ""Some People Change"" is great. ""Twenty Years Ago"" is another one that I can relate too."
4,"Great for DVD movies, beats Sony Wega hands down","I've been shopping for a 27"" TV for my room to watch DVD movies in letterbox format. I've compare picture quality between the Sony Wega and Toshiba. The Panasonic comes out ahead of the pack. They all have 3 line comb filter, but the Sony only have 500 lines across compare to Toshiba and Panasonic which has 700 lines. Which the CT27SF37 has a clearer picture."

It is a copy of the first edition, which has entered the public domain. There is no indication of this on the product description page. If you want the final edition that Hardy revised, look elsewhere."
5,A CLASSIC AND A MASTERPIECE.,"If you want to know and share what is math, you have to read books like this. You have to know that math is about thinking and solving problems. But that's not all there is to it, you have to know that she's like a beautiful woman, she's about beauty, art and love. That's what a man who is in love would 'think' about his beloved one. That's what you'll say the moment you begin to understand math. You'll fall in love with her.Federico TejadaPS: You can change the pronouns to adapt it to your personal gender or orientation.One thing else: Math is about doing it for yourself, not only reading what others did."
3,Kurt to the Chase,"I usually like Kenneth Brannagh -- love him as a filmmaker -- but found him perhaps miscast in this kind of dreary series. He's too lively an actor for such low-key goings-on. He has some effective moments, but he'd be better suited to a less subdued role. For instance, I think he'd make a first rate Tom Thorne.The visuals here are often quite arresting, but I was never terribly impressed with the rather forgettable cases. The first one is the best, but by the time we get to the last, the main character is almost literally sleepwalking. Plus, none of the lead's colleagues really register."
4,Good Resource,"These 3 DVD's present the subject matter well. Hagganah is very simmilar to Krav Maga and the whole concept is well presented by Mike,Worth buying if you can get hold of it."
5,good pimpin game,this is a good book very genuine gives spcific details very interesting something that will take your game to another level a must get book i bought this book 2 times cause the knowledge is unique and the player is a antique
4,VERY GOOD BOOK...,"I ENJOYED READING THIS BOOK, VERY WELL WRITTEN. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE ELSE. THAT WOULD LIKE TO GET SOME INSIGHT TO SOME OLD SCHOOL GAME..!!"
5,ISM!,White Folks ties up shoe laces with the game dropped in his book. I look forward to any future writing endeavours White Folks comes out with. Because I know it will be pure ISM!
3,goodness gracious,"some of the songs on here are really good and fit right in with the r&b and hip hop of 2004, but thanks to superbowl janet was boycotted everywhere. If she hadn't performed with that cracker justin timberlake she would have been all over the place like she deserved to be, but her bad choices led to her downfall and she still hasn't recovered from it, AT ALL."
3,Janet is out with a new sound,"Janet has definitely come out with a new sound in Damita Joe. The cd is not all bad. She's even revisited her r&b roots on this cd. My main issue with Damita Jo is there are numerous times Janet is singing so low, you cannot understand or hear her over the music and she's drowned totally out.I see Janet getting better, because actually this is a better cd than her last. The new sound is pretty much working for her, just needs to be sure we the listeners can hear her voice."
3,Download a Few Songs,"My favorite tracks on this album are Damita Jo, My Baby featuring the man of the moment Kanye West, and Spending Time With You. Janet brings back memories of All for You with Warmth and Moist. If you haven't heard them, use your imagination, I'm sure you can figure out what they are about. This overall is a nice cd, but without any strong singles it kinda gets forgotten about among my collection."
5,hot,the more i listen the more i love this cd. all nite is such a hot hot track. this cd is all about sex and sensuality and getting your body moving. with all the controversy it's nice to see that she is still one of the top singers/performers out there.
3,Disappointing Damita,"An avid life-long fan of Janet I am, but not of this cd. It is average at best, definitely not her best work. Too many slow tracks and not of the lively Janet we are used too. I think there are 4-5 good songs, the rest are pretty much sexed-up ballads without much going for them. Save your money and buy the singles!"
4,Love her album! Janet still can make you dance!,"I love this album! Liked the dramatic Telepopmusik intro. The dance numbers are all solid! ""All Night"", the title song, ""Spending Time With You"", ""My Baby"", and many others are so funky! ""Just a Little While"" sounds new-wave-ish to me, but it's okay. I liked the Jam and Lewis songs, but Kanye West, Bag and Arnthor and the others were also solid with their offerings on here! Very good music to drive on the interstates just in time for summer!"
5,"MISS JACKSON, IF YA NASTY!!!","I love it. This is great Janet. Much better than the last album -- not quite Control or Velvet Rope, but it is great to hear her doing some R&B and, of course, the dance music ROCKS. Janet -- you are my girl. Keep it up. For all the haters out there -- Janet is laughing all the way to the bank...."
2,gosh ill rather listen to spice girls,what were you thinkin janet i mean you made 22 songs most of them are about islands i like strawberry bounce but man the rest of the album is trash and im mad because i spended 18 dollars on a cd i don't even like people who read this don't waste your money
5,janet,"this album is great and i am a janet fan but i'm not giving it 5 stars because of that ,because ""all for u"" was not one of my fav's th almbum is more R&b than pop,and has the three or more usuall upbeat songs that get's u dancing kanye west brought out banging beat for miss jackson on ""strawberry bounce"" and ""my baby"" using his sample heavy sound and style. two words buy it"
5,"Move over Ms.Jackson, Damita Jo's here!","After All For You took awhile to get used to, I didn't know what to expect from this, but it is genuinely good. If you are looking for the real popish songs from the last album, this one isn't it. 99% of Damita Jo is a mixture of old and new school R&B. My favorites include: Damita Jo, Sexhition, Thinkin Bout My Ex, and Moist. When I first saw some of the lyrics before hearing the actual album, I was a little worried. But it pretty much is delivered tastefully. Even the ""baby-making"" songs aren't as raunchy (Would You Mind). This is one of the best albums, period, I've bought in a long time. Even nontraditional Janet fans can enjoy this!"
3,not janet's best,"musically she did much better than all for you, but her voice and the lyrical content is very weak and very vulgar. The bonus tracks should have been featured on the worldwide release of the albu, they're some of the better songs on the album musically, I just wish she had made a better effort to use her voice on them instead of lazy, uninspired singing."
1,Not the Janet we know,"After purchasing this CD and listening to it, I can't believe that it was even produced and released. This is not the Janet that we knew back when. Nothing like what she used to sing and the songs are senseless and no rhythm to them. Control was a great buy and rhythm nation, this is just not Janet. I would never encourage anyone to buy this CD. To me, its the worst CD I own. Sorry Janet, but not good."
2,"JUST A LITTLE WHILE, is the best track","The only song i like on this cd is ""JUST A LITTLE WHILE"",the rest are just boring, the usual oohhs & aahhhs from Janet.make's me so mad when they can make such an uptempo track and release it as the first single, then the rest of the tracks they could'nt be bothered.BUY LATOYA JACKSONS new CD ""STARTIN OVER"" which is full of upbeat tunes, i love it, i got it in 2002, still awaiting it's official release soon, and the first single out soon to be called ""JUST WANNA DANCE""."
1,Damita Jo Delivers a ride both Nauseous and Diahhereatic,"Hard to say this as I am a HUGE janet fan. But ""Damita Jo"" just does NOT deliver the quality of Janet music we are used too. Promos report that it is a musical ride of Janet's emotions and personalities. Personally I feel it was a ride that makes one both nauseous and ill. Only saving factor of this Cd is the ONE song ""Up All Nite"". Save your money and pray just this song comes out on a single. For those who do purchase it....Good Luck, Take some Pepto for the upcoming upset stomach and hit track #1, and let your ride begin."
4,"Better Than ""All For You""","A slick album - A job well done for Janet and her team. Very sexy, upbeat, sunny album. Listening to this album emotes many different energies. This album is better than her previous ""All For You"". BEST TRACK: ""Island Life"". Best booty shakin cut - ""All Night (Don't Stop"". Best slow jam - ""Thinkin bout my ex"". REFRESHING to say the least. A must have for any *R&B junkie*"
4,Her Middle Name,"Wow!! What can i say about this. This album is one of her best if not the best she's done. Before the album was released i thought that it would bore me because i thought that it would be all about nasty sexual things. And although it does have it's ""sexy songs"", they aren't really that nasty becaue she is singing about it in a different way. The song i'm talking about is MOIST. She has what i call i good work out/dance track on the album calleD ""Just A Little While"". This song is so damn good it hurts me. (LOL) And her interlude ""Country"", is funny. Now the stand out tracks on here are Sexibition,Strawberry Bounce, All Nite(Don't Stop), R&B Junkie, Thinkin' Bout My Ex, And Just A little While. It's very easy to listen to. You just put it in and jam to it. I love the DAMITA JO side of Janet. I've been a fan for years and i love her even more now that i've heard her ""OTHER"" side!!! You will not be dissapointed..."
5,Sad PR stunt but hot album,"I thought this album was definitely going to be garbage because its first single ""Just A Little While"" sucks!! But, I was wrong.. this album is definitely good.I don't know about it being her best b/c I don't own any of her previous albums but this album is good. Someone who reviewed this album said that the beats sound the same on each track..... you're a fool.This album has great production on each song and every songs has its own beat.Get this,great album."
5,KEEPIN IT REAL,"I THOUGHT THIS ALBULM WAS VERY OUTSTANDING!IN THIS ALBULM I THOUGHT JANET REALLY EXPRESSES HER TRUE SELF.(FORREAL)I ALSO, THINK THAT EVERYONE OF HER SONGS DEFINES HER TRUE EMOTIONAL BEING, AND THE UPS AND DOWNS SHE'S HAD IN HER LIFE.MY 2 MOST FAVORITE SONGS ARE(LIKE U DON'T LOVE ME)AND(THINKIN BOUT MY EX)I TRUELY LOVE THE WHOLE ALBULM, I TRULEY LOVE JANET! MISS JACKSON IF YOUR NASTY!!"
2,Disappointing,"Great background, but can't hear the singing well. The lyrics are almost indistinguishable. Some of it devolves almost to rap, which I hate. Usually, with rap, though, you can hear the words along with the bass/drums beat.Backround was pretty good, and makes good filler. The singing was hardly art. Some of the intro talking was really pretty insipid."
1,TWO SUPER SIZED THUMBS DOWN!!!!,"This album sets JANET JACKSON or should I say DAMITA JO back to her Fame days. What a waste of MONEY I put this cd (...). Now I know why she had to come up with something to get this to move off the shelves. IF you like a lot of softed voiced mumble jumble and maybe ONE dance song --Here it is. IF you want music that you can sing or dance to-- Move on. I heard Janet say this is a album about being in love well, I find it more LUST than LOVE. Janet keep this love cd behind closed doors and do what you do best DANCE MUSIC."
1,Very Disappointed,"I've been a Janet Jackson fan for almost 20 years now and I must say that this is the weakest of all her albums. The production is very strong, polished, and crisp (as usual), however, the music is bland and very uninspiring. I know Janet is really into exploring (and exploiting) her sexually, but she doesn't take us into more of a deeper realm that other artist like Prince hasn't already been to.Out of the 22 tracks on this album, I only bother listening to two - ""Spending Time With You"" and ""SloLove"".If you are looking for GOOD Janet Jackson albums, then please direct your attention to Control, Rhythm Nation 1812, Janet., and the Velvet Rope. Leave this one on the shelf."
1,"tasteless, vacuous and slicky-slicky.","Janet, this is little more than self-indulgent drivel. Where life meets art you claim? Tasteless, vacuous and slicky-slicky indeed."
1,How disgusting and disgraceful,"This cd has very limited quality, i mean no quality. It is just janet singing stupid songs. It has too many tracks where she talks about listening to the radio, or going to the beach. Its pure nonsense. When i bought it i listened to it in my walkman and instantly vomited into my Louis vuitton bag, thanks alot janet.. that is a total waste of eight hundred dollars. Dont buy this cd. If you are keep your reciept bacause you will want to return it. When people mention the name Janet jackson i think in my head ""high cheek bones + the same nose as her brothers so not make a good mix"" Ha! Dont buy it. You will only disappoint yourself"
4,"better than all for you, this is for you","Yes,I am a big fan of Janet,and i must say that i am her biggest critic as well.This cd is good a nice mix of R&B, dance and with a little bit of retro thrown in.I've never been one to like slow jams even from miss Jackson,but i have to say they are pretty good. This album does have explicit lyrics,but not as bad as 'All For You' contained. If you are looking for an all dance CD dont bother,but if you like something with a little variety this is for you.This CD could do very well with the right releases and STRONG videos to back them up.superbowl bashers and all janet bashers aside. make the choice for yourself everyone has different taste.I think This cd is worth having."
5,Damita Jo is Damita-rific!!!,"First of all, if you are still smarting over the incident of the super bowl, or are insecure about intimacy, then this cd ISN""T for you. Having said that, Janet's new cd, is filled with great r&b jams and timeless ballads and is one of her best efforts in a long while! Once again, the QUEEN OF POP (the media's title, and not something she had to fax for them to call her) is back, and ready to rule the airwaves once again. Get ready for a rhythm nation indeed! Unlike other so-called divas, Janet continues to remain relevant to the times, nuff said!!"
2,"Janet, you can do better than this..","This is by far, the worst Janet album of her career. We're all tired of her heavy breathing, fake orgasms and meaningless lyrics as we struggle through the twenty-something number of tracks on this album.Especially because Janet takes a few years between albums, we expect more from her. All of the songs on the album are under four minutes in length giving one the impression that she rushed to get the album out.The only songs worth considering as possible hits are Thinking About My Ex, R&B; Junkie (good song) and I Want You. The others are fluff and nowhere as good as the songs on her All For You album. Sorry Janet, this one's a write-off. Better luck next time."
3,BRING RENE BACK!!!!!,"Yet another mediocre album. The interludes are corny & should've been left out altogether. There are only 3 songs that are worth mentioning:1) R&B Junkie2) All Nite (Don't Stop)3) SloloveAll Nite (Don't Stop) is a remake of Evelyn King's ""I'm In Love."" She coos for the better part of the album. Most of the tracks are mid-tempo to slow. The 3 listed above are all up-tempo.This album will have to grow on me as I listen to it more & more, which certainly wasn't the case with Control, Rhythm Nation & Janet.I was SO hoping that this album would be a musical blockbuster from start to finish, but sorry to say, it's not..."
5,She just keeps getting better!,"Damita Jo may come close to being one of Janet's best compilations of pop, R&B; and dance music, which is saying a lot given the quality and infectious music this brilliant artist has been churning out for 2 decades. Janet's original sound continues to impress, along with slick production, a great mix of catchy uptempo as well as soulful tracks. Even Janet's thoughts and ramblings between songs start growing on you, and you can't help but smile at how cute her persona is.Stand out tracks are Damita Jo, Sexhibition (one of Janet's best tunes in a long time) and SloLove. But the one song that alone is worth the price of this entire album is All Nite (Don't Stop) which will keep the dance floors shaking for a long, long time."
2,What happend to Janet??? :(,"I was so excited to get this CD. I must say that this is one of the biggest waste of money I have ever spent. It almost puts me to sleep...almost all of the songs are mono tone and dull. There are no songs that stick out as being ""classic"" like the older stuff Janet is know for. This CD will most likely fall like a rock on the charts. The first single ""Just a Little While"" peaked at #45 then quickly fell and the second single ""I want you"" Is doing much worse and is currently charting in the 60's. I expected much more from one of my former favorite artists. Save your money and wait for the next one."
1,awful,I used to love Janet. But now all she sings about is sex and it's boring and gross to keep talking about it. She needs to retire now. And please stop doing stunts. It makes everyone hate you.
2,No artistic growth on this album,"Is it just me, or is Janet Jackson trying to rip off Sade's ""Love Deluxe"" album cover? The black & white shades, body position, hair, etc . . . If you ask me, Sade got it right the first time. Really, Janet. Maybe you should stick to pasties or military gear circa 1814. As for the album, only ""SloLove"" sounds current and may lead to some great remixes. I also wish she would choose different procducers . .. I am sick of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis tunes. They have produced every album since Control . . . .YAWN!"
1,Damita what,"Lyrics like ""I feel you get erect, there's no place warmer than my mouth"" say why this album stinks. Degradating, decadent. Janet is over."
1,Bash this to pieces!,"This new album from Janet Jackson is just unbelievably terrible! The lyrics are lowlife inspired and totally vapid to a nauseating degree. Every song and interlude is awful.Nothing good on here. All For You was a big fat dissapointment but it sounds like a masterpiece compared to the cruel joke that is ""Damita Jo""!I can't believe taht she has sunk this low. Avoid this CD. It's unbelievably vapid and stupid!"
3,Missing Songs,"My 6 mo old is MESMORIZED by anything Bear. He especially loves the songs, so when I saw that the episode with Grandma Flutter had the bathtub song and what's in the mail, I bought it in a heartbeat. Well...THE SONGS AREN'T ON THE VIDEO!The rest of it is great, but this was a big disappointment."
5,Awesome Game!,This is my husband and my favorite game (and we've played quite a few). This game is so enjoyable and challenges you to explore each other in new ways and in new places in the house. I would suggest this game to any couple!
2,Hammermill Laser Print 3-hole punch paper,Not good for printing on both sides. It will curl up and not go back into the duplexer. Recommend it for printing on one side only.
1,Yick.,"I had been a casual fan of Brown's work until I paid money for this monstrosity. The plot is dull- a lame rehash of the countless ""rise of the old USSR"" that have flooded the genre since the events of 1991. The characters are weak, and the plot twists are weaker. Worst of all is Brown's disgusting Clinton-bashing, so naked in its hostility that it makes Brown look foolish and petty. Maybe Brown should have spent less time whining about Clinton than writing a better story. Better yet- he could give me my money back."
4,Very amusing,"I'm torn between 5 stars and 4 stars for this book, but I tend to be a tough grader. This book is very humorous. A delightful read. Buy it for vacation. I also like ""A Walk in the Woods"" - also a travel type book and very funny."
3,Good,"Please do not go by my review. I bought the album for one song ""knuck if you buck"". I have never listened to the album."
1,Tough to Read - literally,"While this book does have some useful content from the couple chapters I have read, the material is overshadowed by a serious problem - this is almost not readable in the literal sense.There is something about the small font size and presentation that makes reading the book tough on the eyes, even with a bright light. I read a lot and this is one of the worst presentations I have seen. The other students in the class who I talked with about this textbook also had the same comment. For a book that charges over $100, this is inexcusable.Unless you want to wind up with a pair of glasses sooner than you think or get a stronger prescription than you have now, avoid this book."
3,Chess puzzles based on traps?,"This book has quite a few mistakes,andin the answers section it sometimes failsto mention other possible answers if there ismore than one.It also has someof the worst puzzles ever.A few of themare based on traps,so theydon't have definite answers tothem,they rely on the opponenttaking the bait.Puzzles should havedefinite answers(variations),whether it'sone answer or more,they must be definite,and the opponent should be forced bycheck or have no greater option but tomake the expected/forced moves.This is notthe case with some of the puzzles in this book.But I must admit,after finishing it,my game hasimproved."
5,Tal John,"Short and sweet then gang. Over 30 years ago I entered the world of Gor. Collecting every book up to and including Magicians. Wrote my one and only ever fan letter to John Norman. Actually received a prompt reply. From someone that stated he was the Author. Encouraging me to write, and I wasn't a writer at that time in the mid 80s. During a long bout with illness. 25 Gor books read back to back was my greatest comfort. Gor has entered my RPG worlds.Had no idea there was this amount of a fan base. And as for this book, been waiting 20 years for it, I am not disappointed in the least.Lord Ronin from Q-Link"
2,What Happened to the Story?,"Early John Norman novels were clever. The characters were contrived and the sex highly improbable but the stories often had clever narrative structure and wonderful pace. Witness of Gor has none of this. It's long and most of the first three quarters is given over to the sexual politics for which John Norman is famous. The repetition is dismal and would be comical if it weren't for the constant claim to be taken seriously. It's strange to have these novels turning up in lists of sado masochistic writing; they are more slerotic than erotic - except, I guess, for the John Norman tragics who can't get enough of the one thin message repeated again and again.And then, suddenly, the novel comes to life and it is genuinely riveting. The action is powerful enough to save the dismal sex and while it lacks the lapidary finish of many of the earlier novels, it is still worth the read."
5,Good Product for Value,"This product worked great. It is not a professional, high-end machine so the results were what I would expect for the type of machine that it is. I would recommend highly for home use if your carpets were cleaned on a regular basis. Not for extreme dirt."
2,Reviewers aren't waiting long enough--won't last!!!,"As the other 1-2 star reviewers who have owned this machine for more than a few months have stated, THE INTERNAL HOSE WILL BREAK ON YOU. We owned this for almost 18 months, and the hose snapped. It isn't worth it to replace it, so we need to buy a new machine. The first few months I used this machine, it was incredible! Fluffy clean carpets, great suction, looked professional. BUT IT WON'T LAST!! I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Pay no mind to reviewers who use this a few times and get excited and write great reviews. I previously owned the other Hoover Clean Surge steam vac, and that one seemed more sturdy, lasted longer, and sucked up more water, leaving the carpet dryer. Of course, all these machines will crap out on you after about 3 years of regular use, but I was really disappointed that we didn't get 2 years from this one."
2,Does not have a long life,Hi! We purchased the Hoover Agility about 2 years ago. It is now not usuable. We are shooping for a Bissel.Pros: It always got out a lot of dirt.I felt it left the carpet drylightweight and pretty colorCons: made from really cheap plastic.brushes kept quitting on usreplacement parts are priceySo after like 4 uses an important front panel cracked. We had it replaced at our exspense. Serveral times the brushes have simply quit working. Once my hubby found a quarter stuck in there. But the other 2 times nothing. The latch for the clean water tank cracked and it leaks but we have been living with that. But we went to use it the other day and the brushes aren't working again. Dh hubby is sick of fixing it.
1,so far the worst in the series,I've liked every book in the series so far leading me to have high expectations of this book as well. Unfortunately I felt this story fell flat. I couldn't get into the main characters at all. They didnt seem to have any substance. Also became somewhat offended by the American slams peppered throughout the book written as thoughts from the main character Xiao Fei. If these are reflections about our culture from the author then I really dont care to help her paycheck by buying another of her books or giving her a second chance to see if she writes anything better. Overall this book was boring and I couldnt wait for it to end. The only reasons I read it through was to see if got better and so I didnt miss any potential setup for the next in the series. Very dissatisfied with this one.
1,A huge disgrace for the advertising profession,"Unfortunately, the lowest mark here is only +1. I's rate this book -10.Ogilvy, that knight errant of advertising that sells, said in the 1970s about the then advertising: ""Lunatics have taken over the assylum."" Lunatics now seem to have taken over ALL advertising and branding!!!Books like ""Lovemarks"" make Ogilvy turn in his grave.Books like ""Lovemaks"" are a huge disgrace for advertising that sells and a delight for ""creaAtinism.""These books strongly suggest that perhaps advertising and branding are past saving.God save us."
1,Would you pay for an advertising flyer?,"Well, you will if you buy this book! If you're in the industry there's nothing in this book you don't already know! If you're not in the ad industry, then by all means, go ahead and buy it so you can see how clever it is to publish a self-serving eye candy full of propaganda for Saatchi and Saatchi and Kevin Roberts concealed as a book about branding!"
4,Good principles about how to build great brands,"I really enjoyed this book, building emotion based links with your customers it's a necessary task in the competitive business scenario of nowadays, and Kevin Roberts explains a framework of this, with examples of how many successful brands have done it and he explains the principles that drives his personal view of the future of brands too.Reading the book it's a stunning visual experience, almost every page has a lot of pictures that makes you understand clearly what it's talking about (a picture is a thousand words worth).I believe that every category needs a very specific combination of the values shown in the book, but that it's not deepened in the book and I missed, because it can make you understand the emotion that drives every product in every category. Well, I think that the latter it's our work!"
4,"Good book, can be hard for undergrads...","I have used this book in my 200 level Sociology of Families courses. The students enjoy most of the readings but there are a few that are overly technical and/or assume the student has a background in the topic. Despite these issues, overall I feel it is one of the better families readers on the market now. Chapters are diverse and do not ""tokenized"" issues like race, class, sexuality, and gender in ""special"" sections. My students really enjoyed the different perspectives and qualitative studies she chose to include."
4,Mylene has nothing to do with this CD,"I would like to throw some information in on this disc. According to the Internet sources, Mylene Farmer herself had nothing to do with the album. It was the initiative of the recording company, and, therefore, singer can't be blamed for the flaws that the CD has.Overall, I think it is a good quality album that serves the purpose, considering that it was released for a certain target group. I think that group has been satisfied.And if a customer is a real Mylene fan, it can't be a waste of money to purchase this item.Good luck."
2,used book,I knew I was buying a used copy of this old book but it's falling apart so is very hard to read. Too bad they didn't repair it or send a better copy. I know the author so really wanted a copy of his book.PEG
1,The Whipper is not squirrel proof,"It is NOT squirrel proof. As a matter of fact all the squirrels have figures out that if the wrap their bodies around the bottom of the feeder and put their claws in the holes, they can have a wonderful feast.Don't buy it! If anyone has one of these and has figured out what to do, please share. I have written toDroll Yankee and have not received any response about the problem."
2,Not as good as I thought it would be,"I've been a big fan of the Droll Yankee Flipper, and have had it for about seven years. For some reason, even after inserting new rechargable batteries, it will not hold a charge for long. I decided to replace it with a non-battery Yankee Whipper. The reviews appeared to be good and said it was pretty much squirrel proof. Our local squirrels figured it our in less than three minutes. If there is any way a squirrel can reach the feeder from a bush underneath the feeder, they can beat the system. They hang on by putting their front paws in two of the feeding holes and eat out of the third. I've cut my bushes back, but it's amazing how high these squirrels can jump. The Flipper would be the way for me to go if I had to order another one."
4,Another squirrel chaser.,"This feeder gives anything over five ounces or so a rude surprise. Step on one of the feeder platforms and it immediately collapses. Highly shocking to squirrels, and even to crows, etc. Very clever feeder."
4,Great!!,"I love this CD product. It has all the basics....numbers, greetings, everyday phrases needed to survive on a journey to another land! Loved listening to the two people on the CD; it was very easy to understand every syllable spoken."
5,good for a beginner,One of the first audio disks I got to learn japanese. Has great phrases and writing in the booklet. Good place to start ^_^
3,"Not bad, but not as good as I hoped","I'm glad I got a good price on this book because frankly it was a bit of a letdown. There was more talk about the taking of the pictures in the earlier sections than there was actual pictures. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of pictures and very good ones, but somehow the book didn't give me the feeling of 'being there' at these abandoned places the way I'd hoped. For example, the book ""Ghostly Ruins - America's Forgotten Architecture"" really did a better job of that. I'd have a look at this book in person if possible before buying it. Maybe it's just what you want, maybe not. I'd have probably taken a pass."
3,Quirks,"While this ebook received generally positive reviews, I need to point out several defects.1. Reviewing facts I know, D. James Kennedy, the former, now deceased pastor of Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church is referenced as ""James D. Kennedy of Coral Ridge Baptist Church."" Location 45640 If there is this blatant error, how many more are there?2. Several appendix entries are organized in an unhelpful manner. For example, instead of being in a helpful chronological order, the 100 Most Important Events in Christian History in Appendix 15 are in some sort of undefined random order.3. Several of the tables are illegible on the DX. They cannot be sufficiently expanded and the type appears washed out - little contrast.4. Unfortunately this ""New"" edition is 9 years old and only one other similar dictionary is offered for Kindle, this probably being the more complete of the two."
5,Grandma says.....,I am thouroughly enjoying my musical washboard. I cut the tips out of cotton gloves and pushed thimbles through so I can get maximum sound and no wear and tear on my fingernails. I put on some polka music and strum along. I encourage my grandchildren to keep rythem with the spoons (making the washboard seem very desirable) . Each has enjoyed our session and look forward to coming back.
4,Grounded for Life: Season 5,"One of the greatest shows ever - except this is the weakest season released. It may have Henry (the youngest brother/son)on the cover and the spine of the DVD case, but he isn't in any of the episodes/season 5. The packaging of the DVD is much simpler than previous releases other releases - slim cases, slipcover, double sided covers, ect. This one is just a standard black case, two disc holder, and insert. It's an okay season. I recommend it anyways."
1,Worst Hair Product I have ever used!,Do not waste your cash. I have nice thick healthy hair but after using this and the leave in product it feels completely dried out and is unmanageable. This is hands down the worst product I have ever used on my hair!!!!!!! It leaves your hair in the same state as Prell does without putting in any conditioner. HORRIBLE. It made my hair tangle in the shower worse than Prell!! This company should be embarrassed for charging what they do for this and they need to go back to the drawing board!!! Glad I bought small containers!
2,Meh..............,"With the advent of Wii, Playstaion 3 and Xbox, why would you want to play this? I threw it out years ago."
1,Very Disappointed,Not disappointed in the game but the retail party that sold it!..This game was totally destroyed when I got it in the mail. How ever the cd's did work so there for I did not return it..because it was a gift for Christmas..
3,A small investment that probably does yield some big savings,"If you're buying a car, buy this book; it's a valuable resource. Of course, my conversations with the salesmen I encountered went nothing like those predicted in the book, but when used in combination with Internet research, it was very insightful. I know it helped me save money on the price of the car (of course, knowing the daughter of the dealer didn't hurt either) and, even more importantly, on closing the deal and all those extras."
1,"I'd prefer 0 stars, actually.",Trite and moralistic introduction to plants that have been used by man for thousands of years.For a more accurate coverage of the subject see: Psilocybin Mushrooms of the World by Paul Stamets and Dr. Andrew Weil
3,Difficulty read...there are better ones out there.,The only reason I bought the book is b/c it was required for a college course. I found myself turning to other sources to obtain info on Christian History mainly b/c the book is very dry and doesnt flow well.
4,Welcome back,"""Strip"" is like the feeling you get when you return to your favorite vacation spot, or put on those old pair of jeans. You wouldn't trade the feeling for anything. Although there are only two ""new"" songs, the other songs are all acoustic versions of previously released songs. This is not to imply that they are the same, as the band (or at least Mark, Dave and Reg) has re-worked the songs to fit there acoustic compositions. This is definately an album to add to you collection for the Chameleon fan or those that like songs 'striped' down to the essentials. I only gave it four stars cause John is missing... it wouldn't be fair to give it five stars without all the members of the band participating."
5,THE POWER OF FLOW,"THE BOOK HELD MY INTEREST FROM START TO FINISH. IT OPENED MY EYES TO THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE MY FUTURE AND HELPED ME TO RECOGNIZE THE INCREDIBLE ""COINCIDENTS"" THAT HAVE SHAPED MY LIFE. NOW I AM SENSITIVE TO EVENTS IN A NEW WAY. MY LIFE IS RICHER FOR IT. I LOVED THE BOOK AND ENJOY RE-READING IT BY OPENING THE BOOK AND READING A PAGE AT RANDOM. I KEEP FINDING NEW THINGS IN IT."
2,Blech.,"What an incredibly bad and BORING book. I usually trust Roberts to tell a good story, but this book raised serious doubts for me. These characters are underdeveloped, BORING and I didn't care about any of them at all. ""End of the world"" - YAWN. I am not even tempted to buy the rest of the trilogy. And Roberts' habit of big, bloated speeches was bad in the last ""Red"" flower books; I'm assuming that no editor's curtailed her because it's just awful here. I just wanted everyone to shut UP with the big, long-winded declarations. And I'm annoyed that the person that, ah, not ends up not being part of the group, is that person. Talk about the final cliche in a book chock full of them."
2,A disappointing novel,"Disappointing. My first hint that the writing wouldn't be great was that the entire back cover of the book was a portrait of Ms. Roberts. I opened the front cover to see the list of prior publications, and it covered two entire pages in a tiny font. The story is compelling - but it suffers by lack of attention to the craft of writing. If you aren't bothered by clumsy constructions or overused words and phrases, then you will probably find the story engaging and not even notice these. But if these little details grate on your nerves, then I recommend passing on this trilogy. I won't be reading the other two books in the trilogy."
2,A Cross to Read,"This book was so dismal and dark, it doesnt even matter that Nora Roberts wrote it. I read only 75 pages, skimmed the rest and left it on the plane. This never was my type of reading material but since I usually like Ms. Roberts' books, I bought this in the airport.Some of her fans might enjoy this type of story; I do not. Waiting for ""Born in Death""."
3,Not as good as I hoped for,"I tend to really enjoy books about vampires. While this was a decent book, it wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be. I did get more interested in it toward the end though. I will also definitely finish the trilogy because it wouldn't be right to read this far and not know what happens. :) For those interested, this is the story of a power hungry vampire, Lilith, and the circle of six (a witch, a sorcerer, a magician, a scholar, a shapeshifter, and a vampire) that come together to try and stop her and her army of vampires from taking over the worlds (yes, that's supposed to be plural)."
3,"Not Up To Par, At Least for Me","I have to say that MORRIGAN'S CROSS is the very first book of Ms. Roberts' that I didn't care for; didn't, in fact, even finish. It could be my own personal dislike of historical romance, but as this was more in the time travel/paranormal vein, I don't think that's true. The problem, at least for me, was unlikeable characters I couldn't relate to, coupled with too many Irish, Gaelic, and unfamiliar terms that the book's added glossary only complicated.I won't knock Ms. Roberts, because she is an unbelievably talented author who I admire. I'm also the world's largest Eve Dallas (fromJ.D. Robb Box Set (In Death)) fan, and have loved theKey Trilogy Box Setand all of her romantic suspense releases (you can see my review ofAngels Fallby clicking on my profile). Let's just say that, for me, MORRIGAN'S CROSS was a miss, instead of Ms. Roberts' usual hit."
2,creepy without the demons,"Am I the only one who thinks its a little creepy to have the old man tell a story with vivid sexual detail to children? As he was telling the story, I kept seeing him in front of the children he called to listen and it took A LOT away from the story."
2,Not Typical Nora,"I love Nora Roberts and have read most of her books...usually when a new one is released I rush right out to buy it. I have to say I was very disapointed in Morrigan's Cross. I had a difficult time getting into this book and it took me forever to read it...usually I get so hooked by her books, I can't put them down. I hope the second one in this series is not as disappointing!"
2,Nice chain but may not be suited for Campy,HelloI made this purchase to match a Campy cassette/drivetrain but it proved to be disappointing.A good looking chain and may be ideal for other setups but not for my Campy Chorus 10sp.Specifically the Chorus derailler pulleys appear to be incompatible and noisy.Thanks
1,Items were poorly packed and arrived smashed up. There was no padding or anything!,The items themselves were fine but the vendor threw them in a huge box with NO packing around them so they arrived smashed to pieces and unusable.
5,Ray Davies meets William Trevor,"If Ray Davies did an album based on William Trevor stories, this is what it might sound like. It's Dunbar's most mature, most accomplished effort yet. A lifelong pessimist, this anglophile seems perfectly suited to adapting Trevor's tales into pop songs. From the sad absurdity of ""The Day We Got Drunk on Cake"" through the desperate smoke-filled ""Ballroom of Romance"" and finally to the perennial hope of ""Another Christmas"", this album is a fascinating tour thru Trevorland. It's an absolute must for Trevor's readers. And yes, it does bring to mind Village Green era Kinks, as well as Nilsson. If that sort of music's your cuppa, you'll find this to your liking even if you're not into the man who inspired the songs. And before long you'll be ordering Mr. Trevor's books and hunting for Mr. Dunbar's previous albums."
3,Been There Done That,"I have several of the books in this series, as I'm interested in nostalgia & local history. Since I grew up in East Sacramento in the 1950's and 60's, I was looking forward to this one; however, it seems that the authors & researchers may have been in a hurry, as there are some factual errors, a lot of proofreading errors, and a lot of focus on some areas & nothing on others. It makes me think they scraped together what they could find & didn't spend much time looking for anything else. There are still a lot of older residents in the area who may have been happy to contribute either memories or photographs or both. It was still a nice trip down ""memory lane,"" but not the complete reminiscence I was hoping for."
3,This is an okay book.,"This book is a decent general overview. However, it consists of a collection of essays that really lacks an overall vision and direction."
4,surprisingly dark & a fantastical journey,"you think you like black metal? this is fine work with merely mediocre production quality. as an audiophile, the quality was something i noticed _after_ the music, and that does not happen very often. the songs on this album contain a very sad undertone with a cry for battle at the same time, releasing emotion in blasting kick & darkened keys. old school style with wonderful vox."
5,What a dedicated Christian!,"I was impressed with the devotion and energy of George Whitefield. He was the driving force for the early Methodist movement, but his name is lost to most people as John Wesely is now identified as the founder of the church.It is a story telling of the work of the Holy Spirit in a human being, and how it motivated him to tell the story of Jesus in a way that captivated the hearts of people.I was astounded to read of the vast number of people who stood outside to listen to George preach, without the aid of voice amplification.Read it and gain a new sense of history in the Christian faith."
5,Great Sandal,"I have been wearing this style sandal for about five years and you can wear these sandals with just about any style of clothing. I have a high arch and I find the Carly to be extremely comfortable, wearing them for hours upon hours. This White Mountain sandal has a lot going for it in terms of style, comfort and is a great sandal for the money."
5,Great book for all levels,I have looked at a plethora of C books. This book is the only one which is very suitable for everyone- from people without programming experience to power programmers in other languages. I bought this book without programming experience. Now I make excellent programs and still use this book as a reference. On top of that it also goes into C++ in the later chapters. I call it my C bible
5,One of the best I saw!,"It is one of the best books on c++ programming. But there should be more notes on each program, especially on the more advanced topics. I will keep this book for reference in future."
1,Condensed style. Mediocre book..Learn C++ 21 days much ++,"This book is typical writing by those who know a subjectand have no ability to put themselves in there readersshoes. Typical technical writing, written to impress theauthor. I'd like to see the authors take someone who hasnever studied the subject and see how they fair with thisbook as their only guide...I believe that they would do verypoorly. Jesse Liberty's ""Teach yourself C++ programming in21 days"" is a far superior book. I own several books on thesubjects and this one is amoungst the more mediocre ones."
2,Not for beginners,"We used this book in an Intro to C programming class. This is not a book for beginners. The instructor knew that this book would not make sense to us without a lecture to introduce the concepts. At best, he hoped that after he explained the concepts, this book would be a way to review them. I didn't even find it useful for that."
3,Good for programmers new in C,"I first used this book as a university text in a first semester course. As a beginner in programminng and C I was totally confused. The book was too difficult to read. Later on though, I found it an exellent reference and guidebook. It covers the Language very well, but you need some knowledge beforehand. In my first year of software development this book quickly ran out of steam. It does not address complex issues in much detail. I felt it lacked the ""why"" of coding. Sorry mates A very good book for programmers who want to learn C."
