3,Hmmmmm...,"I bought this for my piggy. She LOVES it. It isn't' the same design, her's is more girly girl but is the same material and size. Even though it is heavier, my piggy can still dump it over. She LOVES doing that so I figure, ""if she's happy!"" I recommend this bowl! :)"
2,"worked, but with side effects","I did receive allergy relief from this product. However, I got a bloody nose after using it for three days. I am not prone to bloody noses, so I believe it was from using this product. Although the bleeding was not excessive, I stopped use immediately. The bleeding stopped after two days."
5,Relief at last!,"I used to take antihistamines, but they made me feel sluggish. This gives me relief from sinus congestion (my eyes still burn) without side effects. It works well for me."
5,A Perfect Blend of All the Good Stuff!,"IZZ has a sound that is difficult to match. They can combine pop culture and Celtic rhythms, coming out with a brand-new style of music that has a lot more taste than most of the noise out today. The harmonies between the two brothers, Tom and John are amazing. IZZ is a breath of fresh air in today's bland society."
2,Mediocre,"There is nothing original about the sound, though the group has musical talent. If they get a better sound, I'm sure theyll be better off."
3,A nice surprise,"I took a chance and bought this record based on Amazon cross references. I was pleasantly surprised. IZZ is a quirky band, with some great potential. I was reminded a little of Primus on the first cut, which I think is the best cut on the album (lots of energy and uniqueness). IZZ could use a better producer - the back up vocals on Lornadoone really take away from the arrangement (that is an odd song - it sounded like a children's song, especially compared to track one). The vocal melodies and lyrics strike me as an afterthought - however, the lead singer has a good voice. I suspect that this album will continue to grow on me, and I look forward to IZZ's next album."
1,A BIG Disappointment,"I saw IZZ perform at a local college festival and liked what I saw so I gladly ordered their fist CD. Bad move. They need to find a new, innovative sound and aim to be less commercialized. They have potential and are good live - better luck with their sophomore album."
4,A Nice Travel Back in Time,"The book I received was exactly as advertised & the fast way thwe order was procesed & sent to me was really nice. All in all, A nice experience altogether."
3,These tablets claim to taste better than most ...,"These tablets claim to taste better than most other antacids and that point is true...there isn't the nasty chalky aftertaste that other antacids have. However, other than that, Amitone works the same as all the other antacids. I cannot tell any difference with Amitone over the others. So, if you're tired of the aftertaste of other antacids, try Amitone."
1,Bounty Hunter,"My wife is better actress than Jeniffer Aniston. How is possible that this woman make a lot money with the same hair style, no talent for years?I am very upset with Gerald Butler. I love 300 hundred and Law abiding citizen. Unbelievable that he makes this stupid movie."
3,A funny sometimes silly movie,"There is a divorced couple in this comedy. She is a newspaper reporter and he is a bounty hunter. When she becomes involved in an apparent murder case, she fails to come to court for a driving offense and the judge issues an arrest warrant for her. The ex-husband is assigned to arrest her. There are several humorous complications in the film. He owes $11,000 for bet loses, and thugs are sent after him to get the money. She is investigating the apparent murder, which the police term a suicide. The murderer hears about her involvement and pursues her to kill her. Overriding all of these twists is that both love one another, but can't admit their mistakes. Will he be able to repay the $11,000 that he owes? Will the two join to solve the murder or work separately and solve it? Will they get back together?"
1,Worst Movie I've Seen In a Long Time,"Bounty Hunter is unbearable. My husband, sister, and I wanted to watch a comedy one day, so we decided to watch this movie. Oh my goodness, the acting and plot are horrible. I usually like Jennifer Aniston, but this movie makes me cringe. It's that bad. We almost made it to the end of the movie, but gave up when we realized it wasn't going to get any better. It's like no one who had anything to do with this movie tried at all."
3,"Entertaining, But Predictable","This was a funny and entertaining movie, but you pretty much know what's going to happen in the end. There were defintely some parts that dragged out a bit. I think the chemistry between Aniston and Butler was just ok. It seems like Aniston plays the same kind of character in all her movies. So if you're looking for something just cute and chick-flicky this would probably be the one! But just don't expect some Emmy-award winning performances!"
1,Terrible Movie!,I watched this film on a flight home from Europe. It was completely unfunny and one of the worst films I ever saw. After a while I could not take it anymore and with probably a half hour or so left in the film I actually chose to stare into space on the plane rather than finish watching this piece of garbage. I wasted a whole hour of staring into space time on this clunker.
2,Romantic comedy - without the romance or comedy,"Based on its plot,The Bounty Hunterwould seem like anotherMr & Mrs Smith [Blu-ray] - a married couple at each others' throats - literally. However, it doesn't work nearly as well. Frankly, for a romantic comedy, there's not much romance or comedy.The twists and turns aren't very exciting. Jennifer Anniston's acting is lifeless. As a movie, it's not horrible viewing, but I wouldn't recommend it."
1,I give up,"Having been following Jennifer Aniston movies frequently, I officially give up hoping some day she would act in something even a little bit as good as ""The Good Girl"".This movies is atrocious. From the first 5 minutes in, you realize you're doomed, so bad it is."
3,Still waiting.,"This was an OK movie. It had some really funny moments however it never realizes the ""wow"" factor. I like both Jennifer Anniston and Gerard Butler but still think they are capable of much better films."
4,Too sweet for its own good,"Good chick flick, movie doesn't really click.It's not macho or feminine, but kinda rolls around on the screen til it's over.It would have done much better with more sight gags & seriousness.Rather than focus on protagonist / antagonist's flaws, the movie should have developed the characters further, then made fun of them.I was left not really caring what happened to them."
4,fun thriller and romantic comedy rolled into one,"A fun and exciting thriller/romantic comedy about falling in love with the person you hate, whom you loved in the first place."
3,monsignor renard dvd,"it is a good copy of the tv broadcast which came in four ephisodes ecept that the first quarter with all the introductions is missing, and so the thread of the story is lost. that is a shame.s j benfield"
5,John Thaw in the movies.,"I had heard about this series from the wgbn-newsletter, I rented it from NetFlix and before the first episode was over, I had been online to AOL to order my own copy. I may collect all things John Thaw. It would have been a privledge to meet and talk with him. We will miss him."
1,i agree with truly too good to be true,"i decided to buy this vaporizer because i read more positive feedbacks than negative. I just use one pad and I didn't evenget one thing out of it. My son was still congested and still had a hard time breathing. My wife hated it because it didn't work. Even at medium setting, i still couldn't smell anything.What a piece of junk!Needless to say, i packed it up and sent it back for a refund.I decided to buy a Vornado cool-mist humidifier...so what if i have to replace the filters, as long as it works!I read good things about this humidifier if anybody is interested!I just ordered it but haven't received it yet*cross my fingers*"
5,A great business book,"This book is great!I've read a lot of books on starting your own business and so far this is one of the bests. It talks about ways your business can be sucessful and even gives a few ideas.It also gives a mini quiz to find a job you will like to do.It also talks about how to find a good business to start based on school,hobbies, and chores. You should definetly read this book."
2,Review of Naked Came the Phoenix,"I didn't enjoy or finish reading this book. It was so slow to develop characters, and seemed disjointed. Not recommending to my friends."
4,an enjoyable experience,"I really like these glasses. The glass really does make a difference -- sometimes. I'll probably next purchase their ""red"" glasses."
2,More Bronzer...,"As a bronzer, this product works well, but I did not notice any signs of a lasting tan. I saw it wash off in the shower. The smell is gross. So basically you get the smell of a self tanner with the effects of a bronzer."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered the style of game because the illustration was shown to be like the one we owned earlier. We had lost tiles from that game so I wanted the same game as to be able to replace tiles if they be lost later. So I looked for the same style of container. When I received the game it was in a square box and the tiles were different. The new tiles were buffed only on the top edges, whereas the older on was buffed on both sides. This makes it very difficult to pick up. The tiles on the new game is made cheaper. So, thanks for down grading."
5,swaddlers are the best,"these diapers are the only reason I stopped using cloth diapers!they are great and aside from the price, an all around good thing!"
4,very satisfactory,The product is nice. A bit highly priced. Shopping experiance is nice and hassle free.
2,VERY DISSAPPOINTING,"i end up skimming through way more than i'm actually reading. there are only a couple of characters that seem to be developed beyond interest. i intend on finishing the series, because i've come too far to not want to find out how the big picture ends."
3,The whole Saga of Seven Suns series,I could go into detail about all the disappointing aspects of these books but I'm not going to waste any more time with the series.- Unbelievable dialogue- Unbelievable storyline- Unbelievably repetitive (to stretch it to seven books)I regret buying the books.
4,masterful electro from the german MUSICIAN,"anthony rother is not a DJ.. or at least not on record! all of his recordings are his own productions and complex re-workings of other artists' tracks.. also, his songs are NOT remotely near the HOUSE genre... if 'redlight district' even sounded that way in Tenaglia's CD, it is because Tenaglia mixed it to sound that way.this CD is filled with quality electro written and produced by rother himself from start to finish.. it is dark, deep, and filled with that tek-voice sound which serves almost like a tour guide through his slowly developing electro-funk beatscapes."
4,Electro,"Yeah, Rother is a far cry from house. File this cd under electro, machine voice infected German electro. I used to have it and enjoyed it."
4,fascinating stuff!,"One of the most interesting and challenging albums Andi Sexgang has put together, God on a Rope combines some truly inventive spoken word and lush, ambient textures. I adore listening to this CD, but I'm sure that a lot of people would write it off as pretentious mush. If you don't mind getting your hands dirty, dig in to God on a Rope!"
2,Crocheted Socks,"I don't like knitting socks, so I tried this book to crochet socks. I found these patterns virtually impossible -- most of the stitches were slip stitches and on these small crochet hooks and thin sock yarn, one could go blind. Also, even working very loosely, it is practically impossible to insert the hook into the loops. I don't recommend this -- and I've been crocheting for over 30 years."
5,"First-time Mat buyer, excellent purchase","I recently bought this mat to accompany my new work-out video and I am very pleased. It is much longer than I need (I'm only 62 inches tall), but I'm not complaining! Yes, there is a chemically smell, but I don't really mind. It is comfortable and protects my back and bones against my hardwood floors. It rolls up very nicely and lays against the wall of my small condo. What more can I say other than it does its job, and does it well?"
5,Easiest books to use to learn to draw,"Ed Emberly has made some wonderful books for kids and grown-ups of any age that have no drawing skills, but want to learn a simple way. His books are the easiest books to get you started if you have no previous drawing skills. He starts with a step by step illustrated lesson to draw one simple item. First a simple straight line here, then insert a circle then, then another line, step by step along the way and before you know it you have a completed drawing that you can be really proud of. I teach Cub Socuts and this artist makes the perfect book for teaching a class when you are a volunteer yourself that is not an art pro.In this one, he teaches us to make monsters of all sorts like a witch, wolfman, Frankenstein, vampire, Also see his book, ""Make a World"", and ""The Big Green Drawing Book"". If you want more Halloween related drawings including cats, jack o'lanterns, and a full haunted house, try Ed Emberley's ""Big Orange Drawing Book""."
5,An absolute read for anyone who cares about asthmatics.,"I have not felt this good in six years. I had my highest ""peak-flow"" reading this morning and this was without medication, the reading was way off the scale for my classification. I attribute this to the combination of Dr. Firshein's techniques and regular exercise(which I have been able to do because of the information in this book). My need of medication has reduced dramatically. Although, there are times when he waxes too ""Newage"" for my worldview, I highly recommend this book for the information on breathing techniques and diet,it is invaluable. It is a shame that my allergist and GP don't recommend these techniques. Hopefully we will see the medical community start to incorporate this information in their treatment of asthma. If you or someone you know has asthma they should examine this book."
1,Not what it claims to be!,"This stuff is NOT the Neutrogena product they claimed it was. Incredibly watery, to the point that when I squeezed it out of the bottle it ran directly onto my white carpet. Would not recommend."
5,Very helpful,Great book and very helpful. Designed so that you can look up issues and read the suggested solutions in a quick reference format. Very user friendly for busy parents and contains practical advice that seems to be working so far....
1,UGHH!,"I can't even begin to describe how much effort it took to just SKIM to the end of this book. The story was preposterous, the humor (and I had to double check that it was supposed to be humor) was way off, the characters were totally shallow, the situations were impossible, especially the bath scene... Stay away from this one."
2,What are the other reviewers thinking?,"Unfortunately, I didn't read the first page before I bought this book. That alone would have make me reconsider. The narration is never interesting, never grabbing, never anything but repetative plodding, but her style is not the unexcusable part. The worst part is the completely un-shocking twist in the don't-even-tell-me-you-don't-know-whodunit. If you haven't figured out the end after the first third of the book, then I envy you, becaue you're probably satisfied with a lot of the simpler things in life."
5,We ove these books.,"This is a great book. It is comprised of 3 short stories that are hysterical. Everytime we read it, it just cracks us up. It takes the view point of a dog, and his hysterical view of typical things like a bath, or a strange rock. We absolutly love this book and this authors other books about stories to read your dog, or stories to read your cat. Absolutly fantastic."
2,HORRIPILANTE,"¿Como puede ser que esta mujer cante tan mal?... Es la unica cantante que oi desafinar en un estudio de grabacion, y eso que tiene arreglos por todos lados."
2,Based on reviews of only 3 stories,"I was disappointed that there was barely a page and a half of comments by the book's author, and much of that included summaries and/or quotes from the story. Two of the three did add some insight to understanding the story. One interpretation was not in sinc with the Psych Manual of Mental Disorders, nor with two psychologists/psychiatrists I consulted. But I may have a better opinion when I've finished reading the book."
4,eGO cyle for a bike-friendly town,"I have owned and operated an LX eGO cycle for two years in a bike-friendly town. I have been impressed with its features and reliabilty, although I did have to replace the original batteries after just one year. I realize now that I probably dishcharged the batteries too low and too often by traveling too far and too fast. I now ride my eGO at a slower pace (Go Far mode) within a 6-8 mile range and recharge the batteries directly after use. I tow a Burley trailer to get groceries and garden supplies. Overall, I recommend the eGO to folks that live in bike-friendly towns who want to go green for pennies per mile."
2,Sick Hip Hop,"This album is the bomb, All the songs are tight the beats ride perfectly with there vocies. They also got some big names to lace some tracks with them such as Bubba Sparxxx, E-40, Haystack Etc. The two members of this group sound perfect togher with the tone of there voice complementing each of them perfectly. If you are a fan of any new school hip hop then check this group out."
3,"Good book for younger readers, NW is better for older ones","I enjoyed reading this book but you can tell it was really geared toward the younger readers. I really couldn't get attached to any of the characters except many Janie and Morgana. The vixen was a nice addition to the group too. The mirrors was a great part of the book and I enjoyed reading about the spells.Night World series is a much better selection of reading material for older readers as myself, so maybe that's why I didn't enjoy Night of the Soltsice as much as I should have..."
5,My 5 Year Old Loves this Book!!!!!!!!!,"My 5 year old loves for me to count the first half of the book and she counts the second half....This is such a beautiful, heartfelt book.I recommend it to all parents!!!!"
4,This Step Is a Blast!!!,"I really enjoyed this step workout. Kendall's personality is great and he was a lot of fun to follow along. There were a few tricky moves, but managable and still fun. The other workout is very boring. If they release again, they should leave off the step 'n sweat and then I can rate it a 5 star. ;)"
1,overly complicated,"I've owned this book for two years and every time I try to find something to cook I end up putting it down with nothing selected. The recipes are creative but overly complicated. Authentic Mexican food, in my opinion, is deliciously simple and unpretentious. If you want a definitive or authentic guide to Mexican food, don't buy this one. If you want a good read and some fairly creative American gourmet takes on Mexican food this is for you."
3,nice player that developed a battery bay defect in 1 week,I bought this player for my son and we both thought it was a nice unit. But after a week the battery and smart media bay would not secure after opening. Amazon processed the return to my satisfaction.
5,Great Buy,I found the MP3 player easy to install and easy to use. It was a gift for my computer illiterate brother. He loves it.
1,Doesn't fit,The door doesn't fit and I have not been able to return it. I have not been able to use it
3,Not as described - ceveat emptor,"As mentioned elsewhere, this does not come in a tin sleeve; it's merely cardboard. That's definitely going to affect its long-term durability. A disappointing bit of misleading marketing from Amazon on this one."
5,extremely happy,"this is a great product, great packaging and shipping, the grandkids are playing all the time, we love this game, just what we expected"
2,You get what you pay for,"I love this game, but not necessarily this set. Game play is hindered by having to watch out for splinters. There are a few places on my board that are really rough. It seems like it is unfinished. I'm not overly excited about the game board, but you get what you pay for."
2,worth buying!,"Sid Vicious Lives is a forgettable compilation for a cheap price. The cover of Belson Was A Gas, titled as ""Belsen"", is pretty neat but Sid doesn't even sing the second verse, he just sings the first verse over again. The rythm section consists of Rat Scabies(the Damned), Steve New(the Rich Kids), and Glen Matlock of Sex Pistols fame, just as Sid Vicious. The tracks from CBGB's are noted as excellent recordings of Sid, those being Search and Destroy(trk. 9) and My Way(AlTERNATIVE VERSION, trk. 10), which sounds better than the recording of My Way on trk. 8. The most interesting tracks are definitely the Sex Pistols remixes. Cheers."
4,It's worth it!!,"I am Hakan Ener,a Turkish friend of Paco de Lucia.Paco has done a terrific job on bringing flamenco into the 21st century with this album.This is not to say that he ends the Cante Tradition.He rather subtly escapes the notion that every compas should be played in a certain ashion in a fixed musical mode.This is shown vy his renovation of the Buleria.He brings new blood to both bulerias,and to Flamenco itself.Well Done Paco!!!"
5,good,this game rules.any one who likes the simosons should give this game a try.it has all the people
1,STOP MAKING SIMPSONS GAMES!!!,"Yes,I like watching the simpsons on tv,no I do not like playing simpsons video games cause they're horrible!This has been going on since 8bit nintendo,and developers still can't make a decent simpsons game.If they really wanted to make a great simpsons video game,then they should release the original simpsons arcade game(the one you had to pop quarters into) on a console.I don't know why that hasn't been done yet,cause THAT was a simpsons game I had a blast playing esp. when 4 people could play at the same time!As for simpsons skateboarding,a big thumbs down!!"
1,This video is completely disappointing.,"My toddler LOVES mighty machines, but this edition is very disappointing. If you've seen the one with the fire trucks and construction site, this video is NOTHING like that. The DC-10 that is the ""star"" of this video actually misidentifies some of the airplanes. Another plane that pulls into a gate isn't the same one that leaves. There aren't many machines in this video, its mostly the same two or three planes taxiing around like teenagers in a mall- interesting for a few seconds, but overall boring and repetitive. I don't recommend this video, although I do recommend most of the other Mighty Machines videos in the series. The quality of this one is not at the same level as the others."
2,Did not take the sting out,I purchased this product to use with my epilady. The product did not take the sting out. I used it to epilade my bikini line. It really did not do much. The product is expensive and I would not waste my money if I were you.
1,duration of solenoid was 24 hours after and disconnect the bateria,"model seems substandard is the second with the same fault, do not lose your money.To pass the swichet and starting the engine the starter is fixed an to unstick it should give you a blow o disconnect the battery"
4,pelle the conqueror,The movie was one of deep trust between a father and son during hard times. Thhe dreams of one child was able to get them through and to their dreams. A moving and very touching film with believable characters.
4,Pelle the Conqueror,"Swedish immigrants move to Denmark in search of a better life in the land of riches and find themselves facing the same crap as Mexicans in the USA, Filipinas in Hong Kong, etc. Mostly, we focus on an old widower (Max von Sydow) and his young son, portrayed by a very talented actor we've never heard of. We get a full cast of characters, each with his or her own story, and we get to know them. Authenticity was sought and achieved. It was a little slow getting started, I admit, but since it clocks in at 2.5 hours, so what? What's your hurry? It's a fine film and I enjoyed watching it.I'd also like to mention that it was made in 1987. Just in case you watch it. There's a little scene that may remind my American readers of Lorena Bobbitt. The film came first. 1987. Life imitates art. Or something."
3,Kandinsky at arms length,"I really enjoy a DVD about the art and artist such as the Alberto Giacometti DVD. The artist lives not only though his art but his own voice and that of his friends. Kandinsky is a steril DVD. If the art was not so compelling, for me this presentation would get 1 star. Buy only if Kandinsky's work compells you, not his life."
5,Fun and Flexible!,I love the way this video allows you to pick your own routine for that day! Chris is so motivating and pleasant to listen to... she keeps you going without confusing you or being over-the-top! Some days you only have time to do a little and some days you feel like doing a lot... this video works for any mood you are in or any time constraint you are under! I also like that you can work different areas of your body and have cardio workouts - all on one DVD!
1,Boring,"Stories start, and are resolved in 1 or 2 chapters and never mentioned again. Characters personalities are never looked at in depth."
5,Works Flawless,"Memory installed easily as expected. No leakage, full capacity. System running faster and more capable as a result of this baby."
1,Why did I bother?,"Why didn't I check the insides before buying this lump of a book? Nice glossy cover shots, but that's about all it's good for. No close-ups of defects, no shots of interior pages, scant descriptions of what is expected of each grade, near to no descriptions of each defect, too many pages spent discussing restoration, and nearly a quarter of the book taken up by advertisements.AND, WHAT THE HELL IS ""GEM MINT""?"
4,Alborada,"I have these dvds. I got mine a few years ago for saving Coca-Cola rewards points. I enjoyed this story, the only problem is one part of the story is missing in mine because it had two of the same copies of one part and another was missing (just forget which part it was because I don't have it with me right now). I tried contacting them after I received it but they had no more available. I did later also get two other telenovelas...Rosalinda and Mi Destino Eres Tu. I enjoy telenovelas very much. I do not like American soap operas at all."
5,I love Kenzie and Gennaro,I loved this series by Lehane. They need to make some films based on these characters. Bubba is definitely my favorite.
5,Diamonds Daisies snowflakes....,"I had NO problem playing the dvd disc. The dvd has episodes relating to the highlights of Donald and Marie's relationship. I would definitely recommend this dvd to anyone who likes ""That Girl"". It will bring back wonderful memories of the show. I hope the manufacturers of this disc decide to make additional dvds for the series."
3,Dual Formatting solution,"I too experienced playback problems with this disc but not until the last 2 episodes. Solution: I watched the rest of it on my computer. If you have a computer with a DVD player, the formatting no longer is an issue."
2,Monica's Story was a struggle to finish..,"I plunged into Monica's story with much anticipation, anxious to hear her take on all events that had transpired over the last year. The beginning staged Monica's life growing up, much more detail than most people probably care to know - I wanted to know about her relationship with the President (or at least her perspective) and not her entire life story. She isn't that valuable to society to have us all know this information. The book is not very well-written, with many typos and backwards English. If someone was writing this book about me, I'd make sure I came out looking a little less like a mental case. I found myself skipping pages toward the end and eventually just skipped to the last chapter. It's basically the same thing over and over again - and never once does Monica take ownership, she's always blaming others (maybe that was illustrated in the parts I skipped)."
4,"Emotional,honest,genuine,telling","Not a lurid sexual expose. A emotional, heartfealt well written account of a womens friendship with the President. A detailed account of the how it feels to be ignored by a lover, betrayed by a friend, hunted by the government and exploited by your lawyer. A story of family pain, survival and healing."
1,The smartest thing to come out of Monica's mouth was ...,The biggest thing about Mamu Monica's book is that it shows she is as self-absorbed as Sick Willie. She doesn't possess a fraction of the integrity that Linda Tripp does. Tripp was tripped up by taking the time to try to befriend such a low-life. It's easy to realize that the smartest thing ever to come out of Monica's mouth was the president's pecker.
1,Get on your knees...,"This book left TONS of juicy details out of the book. We didnt read it for the story, we read it for...well you know. Well I hope there is a director's cut version of it coming out soon that will include everything."
2,Stupid is as Stupid Does,"Made up to look like a librarian on the cover of Monica's Story, Ms Lewinski's ""tell all"" is no more a reflection of the truth than is her image on the cover. Is it any wonder that her story demonizes everyone involved, while leading the reader to believe Monica is just a mixed up victim? The only victims will be the persons who buy this dribble. Sadly, I am one of them. Do yourself a favor and spend your money on some intellectual stimulation. Otherwise, the supermarket tabloid will suffice the ""tell all"" groupies just fine"
3,A must read for anyone interested in Bill Clinton,"I initially purchased this book because I have been following Bill Clinton's presidency and career for many years. I expected to discover new things about him and to maybe get an insight about this affair. I think Monica would have done a better job writing this book in her own voice and explaining the emotions, thoughts and reason which led her to this affair. As for Clinton, he came out of this thing better than I thought. I wasn't at all surprised by the conversations and relationship experiences that I read. The only thing I was amazed at was how he managed to keep functioning in the midst of this stormy relationship and the all afterward in which he tried to help her find a job. I think in the end I felt sorry for both of them for not thinking twice before they jumped into a whirlwind affair that would inflict so many wounds on both of them, especially her."
4,Honest Insight From the Woman Who Changed US History,"From grade school through the impeachment debacle, Monica lets readers into the innermost reaches of her mind, recounting, in detail, her feelings as her private life was being played out the world's stage. The reader becomes keenly aware that Monica is much, much more than the ""Portly Pepperpot"" as she was deemed in the tabloids. Rather, she is a human being with the same frailties that we all deal with. The book is a definite page-turner and a good read."
1,Embarassment to my Generation,This poorly written book was an embarassment. I am 20 years old and would NEVER end up in Monica's preicament. How dare she gloat in her celebrity? She should be at home hiding under the bed. Andrew Morton is a terrible read. There is more to life than one's weight problems! A big old UGH!
1,Not worth your money...,This book was very disappointing. It portrays Monica as being some sort of hero. She is not a hero by ANY standards...
4,think again,"Although some may see this novel as predictable, Hitchcock's voice is fun and engaging. If the plot can be anticipated, it is still worth the trip since protagonist Jo is so likeable, and it's enjoyable to spend time with her. The plot concentrates on the decline of a NY social queen to the depths of bankrupcy as a result of Monique's malice. It is the willful act of destroying Jo, rather than uncontrolled tragedy, that makes this novel fun rather than morose. Although the depth and repetition of suffering wore me down, it makes Jo's final actions believable. Definitely a good choice for summer reading--I am glad I heard the interview on Diane Ryme's show."
4,Light Read on NY High Society,"It is an easy read about a NY socialite scorned and her devious plan to seek revenge. It's for readers interested in the going on's of New York high society. The ending is a little contrived but overall, it was terrific summer read."
2,Very disappointed...,"I started this book thinking it would be a light-hearted and fun with a little bit of mean, socialite humor. I was very disappointed because the main character goes from good to bad to worst. Starting out as an admired, wealthy woman, she ends the book willing to take any means necessary for revenge. I know books don't all end happily, but this one had no redeeming qualities. Wish I hadn't spent the time."
1,ugh,Maybe I just don't get it. These people just don't exist and if they did I would have no interest in them or their doings. The plot is contrived the characters are sick and I only wasted my time on this book because it was chosen by our book group. The hardest thing to believe is the high percentage of the people that reviewed the book gave it high marks. Maybe I just don't get it!
4,The Agent is a great introduction to Higgins work.,"I'm a long time fan of Higgins' work and I don't think that The Agent is the best of the batch. But that's not to say that it is not a very good book. My suspicion is that it was written as an effort to broaden his audience. I hope it does. It's easy to read and moves quickly. In some of Higgins' other books, a conversations between two people could last a hundred pages. That demands a bit more attention from the reader. (And offers a greater reward in the end.) Anyway, The Agent is definitely worth reading. Even though it's not the best Higgins, it's still better than most other offerings in or out of the genre."
2,no good,this was a no good book. the plot runs through in like one chapter when the author all of a sudden tries to make it happen. it just doesn't work
1,No compres este disco,Este disco no es de canciones enteras sino pedacitos o muestras de 30 canciones. Cada seleccion tiene solamente entre 40 y 50 segundos.
1,"Snippets of songs, not songs!","The above reviewer is correct. This CD DOES NOT CONTAIN ENTIRE SONGS, only 40-50 second samples of each song. Why would they do this and not have it clearly stated somewhere?"
5,Outstanding,"This is an awesome production and a wonderful opera, one of thebest contemporary works in the post-wozzeck era. Very exciting forevery modern opera lovers."
3,"Incendiary, yes. Listenable, no.","Like most of you, I own just about every Coltrane release from the 1960's; I just cannot get enough of the passion, the fire, the invention, the vision ... the exquisite SOUND. Sadly, after my initial excitement upon learning that the spotty Pablo European Tour releases had been expanded and remastered, I am now left with utter dissapointment that the reason the original releases sounded so awful is because, well, the recordings sound awful. Remastering simply put lipstick on the pig. Are these performances incendiary? Absolutely. Are these recordings listenable? Hardly. Yes, Coltrane and the entire band roar and wail; too bad we have to listen to it through a tin can and a length of string. Instead, spend your hard-earned money on the Impulse releases (all of them!)."
1,"Now you see it, now you don't",I received this pad and put it in my extra-large igloo house for my two dogs. I came home only to find it in tatters. Not very sturdy - I was seriously disappointed. It's cheaply made and I wouldn't recommend purchasing it.
4,teasing appetites for future stories,"OK, I'm the author of this book. I gave it 4 stars because *nothing* I write will ever be perfection. If you're an honest objective fiction writer, the *next* book will always be better, but (unless you're really stupid or sociopathic) no work will ever rate unto perfection.This is a collection of short stories, some published (between 1985 and 1999) and some pristine. There are also poems - work-in-action, work artifacts. If you liked 'the bone people' or the short story collection 'The Windeater' you'll probably like this book (aside from anything else, the production value alone equals *****.) If you havent read those books - hey, try a walk on the West Coast Maori side! Aotearoa-New Zealand that is- we have spider-boys among us, archaeological mysteries are commonplace, and the borderline between worlds is not infrequently crossed-="
4,Definitely worth the read,"This collection of short stories focusing on Maori language and culture by Keri Hulme is a challenging read, but the effort definitely pays off in the end. ""Stonefish"" shows off a variety of writing styles, from a kind of whimsical how-to format in ""Some Foods you should not encounter"" to the haunting, poignant tale of a Japanese New Zealander working in a fish industry told in ""Moonfish."" Some stories are difficult to grasp as Hulme has the tendency to deposit the reader in the middle of a situation/fantastical land/post-apocalyptic world without any sort of contextual prefacing, so numerous reads may be required, but trying to figure out what is going on is part of the pleasure of this collection.Each story stands alone by itself, but as a whole, ""Stonefish"" speaks volumes about Maori culture, past and present. Definitely worth the read!"
4,Schlocktastic!,"I had never seen this movie before I bought it on DVD. Being a big fan of both Landis and the wonderful Baker ""monster maker"", I just had to see this ""schlock classic,"" and it does not disappoint! The movie itself is fairly entertaining with many movie references for the film buff and some genuinely insane moments: the title character, The Schlockthropolus, is great fun. The BEST feature of this disc, however, is the feature length commentary by John Landis and Rick Baker. For cult film fans this commentary is a must, providing fun insight and inspiration to future filmmakers and schlock fans everywhere. Great fun, the four stars are for the pure enjoyment of this DVD. A lost classic and another gem from Anchor Bay."
4,Good enough,"This product is exactly how it's described--nothing more or less. In that way, I am very satisfied with it. The plastic isn't as flimsy as it usually is either. It was certainly worth the money."
5,FUN LOVE THEM!,ITEMs are great gonna have a blast painting them and making a necklace for a medicine man outfit FUN ITEM A+++
5,Awesome little guy,"I absolutely love this little guy! I ordered one as a gift for my boyfriend, and I loved it so much I almost kept it for myself. Had to order another so we could each have one.The mini shrunken head is perfect for a review mirror in a car, perfect size. The detail is great, although I wish he had more hair."
4,pretty good charger,"I really have to shove it into the car socket, and sometimes I have to ""wiggle"" it to get it to connect, but for the price, that's a minor flaw."
3,Tragically Confused,"I've never been a fan of the Tragically Hip; I find their songs to be generally punctuated by dull guitars and grating, joyless vocals. However, I will concede that Trouble at the Henhouse is their best effort, and has enough decent songs to warrant a second look. 700 Ft. Ceiling, Butts Wigglin, and Put It Off are interesting, but this album is almost worth the price of admission simply for the fantastic Ahead By A Century. If you're a Tragically Hip fan, you'll probably love this album."
3,Not as enticing as the film (Spoilers),"I have to admit that I slightly prefer the film over the original Peter Benchley novel. One of the things I had a problem with this book is that there's more politics and social issues than the shark itself. By the end of the second act, you'll feel the urge to skip a few pages and get on with the famous hunt on the Orca boat. Plus, the romance between Hooper and Mrs. Brody just comes out of nowhere. It was truly unnecessary, and I'm glad they took it out in the film.But there are some good things going here. The descriptions of ""the fish"" are absolutely terrifying (the human deaths as well). Hooper's annoying personality makes me cheer for the shark when it eats him alive. The similarities between the deaths if Quint and Ahab adds a nice touch in the conclusion of this book. And the ending overall is not your typical Hollywood ending, and so it adds another plus.I did enjoy reading the original novel, but not as much as I enjoyed the film."
2,So-so,"As stated by others, the movie is way better. Character development is weak and it contains none of the suspense of the movie. This is a case of a book being better if it had been based on the screenplay."
2,So disappointed,"As a life long fan of the movie Jaws I recently thought that I should read the book the movie was based upon. So, when I got a Kindle for Christmas this book was my first purchase. I was really looking forward to it thinking that of course the book will be even better than the movie. It wasn't. Overall the book was a big disappointment. You don't care enough about the characters and end up not liking quite a few of them. I did enjoy Brody's character, but not enough to give the book any more than 2 stars."
4,The Movie was Spectacular. The book...quite good.,"In reading Peter Benchley's Jaws, two things were striking...The first was how rapidly he kept the pages turning.The second was how brilliant the screenwriters were when adapting the novel, in their decisions about what to leave out and what to expand on.Benchley's novel provided a very good idea and a solid structure, and the script zeroed in on what was human and compelling and reinforced those elements.I recommend this book. You will be struck by some of the characterizations that originally were established in the novel. I prefer Spielberg's vision of Hooper, for instance. You will also hear Robert Shaw's voice every time you read one of Captain Quint's lines."
3,"Not bad, but the movie is much better","A great white shark menaces a coastal community, threatening to scare off the summertime trade on which it depends, until the town sheriff, a young shark expert, and a renegade fisherman go on a hunt for it. It's not a bad book, but this is one of those rare cases in which the film is better. Spielberg cut away most of the fat that weighs the story down, such as the pointless antagonism between the three heroes and the affair between Brody's wife and Matt Hooper, which is presented through a silly and clumsily written swinger mentality that betrays the books '70's origin."
3,1975 Film Awards,"The movie deserved its awards.Before starting this book, I so looked forward to all the details that are normally left out of the movie, those tidbits that they ruthlessly edited out of scenes to shrink a few hundred pages into an hour and a half movie.Yet to my surprise most of those scenes didn't exist in the book. To the point that on a few occasions I found myself checking the cover to make sure I had the right book.For my personal taste, this is one of the few books in which the movie was better."
3,Its not as good as the film,"I know it was written 30 years ago, but I thought I might try it. I was wrong, it's okay, I think it has done better since the Jasws film, this is not in the same class."
4,Jaws visits the second generation,"Of course I read Jaws when it first came out when I was a teenager. I can still remember lying out on our back porch one brutally hot summer and chewing through the pages, no pun intended. Well, my ten year-old recently insisted he was ready to read the book that inspired his favorite movie, so I ordered it for him from Amazon. He got through the first sex scene and threw the book down, completely grossed out. (Ha! He'll read it differently in a few years.) After he put it down, I picked it up again and it was almost as good as I remembered thirty five years ago. What fun."
2,Great game if you can get it to work,This is a really fun game but I just wanted to warn potential buyers that it will NOT work on newer Windows OS like XP and Vista. The game will install and you can start to play but the game will critically fail and crash. I did a lot of research online for solutions but the only way to get it to work properly is to play it on an older OS. Changing the compatibility mode will do nothing nor will any of the other claimed fixes.
5,The Best Dharma Book Around,"Food for the Heart is indeed that. I have studied Dharma for many years and this is by far the best instruction I have read. Those years at the Buddhist University did not come close to what Ajahn Chah has to offer. If you have any interest in the true teachings, read this book. It might not change your life but will change how you view life."
2,Great Art But Nothing Else,"Paintings almost always seem so much more rich and alive when seen in film and slide media instead of in a book. Such is the value of this film which presents the viewer with a reasonably good variety of Magritte's work.The problem with the film is that we are told almost nothing about Magritte himself or the artistic and social culture in which he worked. The commentary for each picture is provided in total academic speak. I love art, have a large collection or art books, and have taken art history courses, but the artbabble on this film is the ultimate in gaseous art jargon. The best way to watch this film is to turn the sound off, and admire the art work."
2,Nothing more than a commercial,"This video, originally filmed in 1988, is washed-out looking. It's nothing more than a 60 minute advertisement for many marinas (or ""marin-ers"" as the narrator calls them) in Florida. It's really cheesey, and you can hear the narrator wheezing every time he takes a breath throughout it."
1,Fell short for me,"I really wanted to love this book but I just really well didn't. It reads so badly and is hard to follow making my mind wander and just hard to get through at all. One minute you are in a scene, the next Boylan jumps a few years ahead or back and I am left wondering how we got from this point to this one. Then she goes back again. Very confusing and frustrating read."
3,Good for the price,The mouse nose is a little bigger than Mickey Mouse so it looked more like a rat. It was still cute and once I wrapped the chocolate and put a bow on the stick it looked really cute. I would recommend this product.
2,Very average,"Ok, the secret is out... I'm a closet soap opera fan. I watch As The World Turns and Guiding Light regularly, and occasionally All My Children. This magazine is ideal for someone who's a casual viewer and only follows one network. The writing is that great, although it isn't bad, per se. It's just very elementary. Other magazines about soaps have more intelligent critiques of acting and stories. The ""spoilers"" aren't as good as in other magazines, either, and the recaps aren't as up to date as in SOD or SPW. Overall, for what it costs, I'd say just get Soap Opera Digest or Soap Opera Weekly. It's a bit better than Soap Opera Update, though, which is why I gave it 2 stars as opposed to 1."
1,Dead battery,"I put the battery on charger for 4 hours as stated on package and the battery did not charge. I purchased this replacement battery for a christmas present and just found out now over 30 days, and can't return. . Warning and beware."
5,"1984, only it's not fiction!","My son was reading 1984 for school and I suggested he read this afterwards. 1984 can seem unbelievable when you live in a free state. Why would any society need thought police? Well this story puts real flesh and blood on the concepts raised in 1984, right down to big brother. It also takes place at an interesting time in Eastern European history, when the fighting STOPPED after WWII. What happened to people who really didn't support Hitler or Stalin after the war? Listen to this and get a taste of what it took for those people to survive in Hungary in the 50's.I love this ""book"" and I wish it would come out in print so it could be considered by our Junior High School for required reading. I would buy a hard-cover copy for each of my boy's so they would always have a greater appreciation for the price of freedom.Great book."
4,Great Summer By the Pool Reading,I picked this book up at the library. The title caught my eye and also the description of the story's content. The beginning of the book is exciting and rather sad when Snow's mother confesses her crime of kidnapping. I thought the book dragged until Snow meets her real mother and then cried when she decribed how much they looked like each other. I rejoiced with Snow and her biological mother throughout the rest of the book and when I had finished was surprised how much I actually enjoyed the book. Great summer reading!!
2,black uggs,Love uggs slippers except black. You have a difficult time getting the dye off your feet. I was very disapointed.
5,Ugg Coquette slippers,"Love these slippers; I have them in all colors and have been buying them for years and are very comfortable; you can also wear them outside because of the sole. They do run big so I order 2 sizes smaller than I normally wear, and they still are a little large."
5,Works great!,"My 15 year old cat started tearing up in one eye, and after only two pads the gunk and problem have disappeared. Seems like the pads disinfect the eye, as well as clean the tear stains. Good product!"
4,excelent CD,"After years away from mexican music, finding this CD on a shelf at the local music franchise store(Tower), BLOWED ME AWAY. How this CD puts together every song I could have ever thought of buying from ""los tacubos"" is magnificent! Of course being the thrifty concious shopper I am, I came here where after searching for it, purchased it. If you are looking for a good, fun, artistic cultural sound that reflects mexican culture, you're in luck ! cause you just found it. I really don't care why this CD was put together, or why there's so many good songs on it ... I just have to say, THANK YOU ! two thumbs up, WAY UP !"
5,wild ride,"Something for everyone in this album,I never thought I could listen to Cafe Tacuba's music without seeing their wild videos at the same time but this album proved me wrong. Their music is like taking a ride with a crazy stranger."
1,ALLAN TURING Serious inaccuracy,"The entry on ALLAN TURING is completely wrong : He was not an 'American' and Bell Labs were not the first to build a relay computer. Allan was born in Paddington, London, England, UK on 23rd June 1912."
3,Arson investigator is engaging hero,"Edgar nominee (?Julian Solo?) and New York fire investigator Reuben introduces young fire investigator, Fritillary Quilter, and her mentor, Isaac Blessing, in this story of dysfunctional family and arson.Young Dorsey Browning has died in a fire in her childhood home. Her sister Faith ? with the backing of the preliminary fire investigator ? blames a faulty bedside radio. Issuing a flurry of lawsuits, Faith refuses to let her insurance company in the house. Claims investigator Quilter calls in Blessing and, under his tutelage, begins her first fire investigation.A likable protagonist and complex forensics keep the pages turning, but the villain is way too obvious and a lengthy back-story slows the pace at the beginning. Although it feels like Reuben is still finding her footing in this series, the book made me want to read her previous books, as the author clearly knows her stuff and has a straightforward, engaging style."
2,Very biased report from a Texas source,"Just something to keep in mind as you read this book: much of what Heard states about OU's indescretions is based upon rumor, and much of it is groundless. Heard's sources are typically UT alumni and people who dislike OU; it's no wonder he was able to dig up so much dirt.OU has surpassed UT in nearly every possible way, save for the series record (which was amassed prior to the 1950's). This book is Heard's attempt to sell books to Texas fans by further feeding to their delusions. I would highly recommend this to Texas fans, but not to anyone else."
2,item not what I needed,"The product description said this item would fit my model of lantern. When it arrived I was disappointed that it would not work. I emailed the company and they said it was what I ordered. That is correct, it was what I ordered because the description said it would fit.I could send it back but the cost of shipping both ways is more than what the product is worth."
4,Great Addition,This CD was a great addition to the series. Although he doesn't have the same big name as some of the others. I have heard quite a bit about him recently. Lets watch this next Big Star.
2,No illustrations,This edition contains references to illustrations that aren't included.The illustrations add much to the story. Was able to find them online but it's a pain.
5,Etidorhpa,"No one but fools and the inept would consider this work fiction, I have read the ""original"" version published in 1895, and have personaly researched the book to the extent of visiting the cavern entrance, verifying dates, places, and the the story told within the book over a 20 year period, and it is TRUE."
1,Remakes,"One star for misleading customers into thinking this might be original music. It is not and though it might be technically acceptable, it is missing the original art which made the song what it is.It's disgusting how prevalent this deceit is!"
5,This is a great CD!,I listen to it almost all the time and it is great. The walkin' on the sun remix is the best and I mean the best so if you are looking for the best by smash mouth this is the best.
2,Not for face eczema,"Again, if your skin is too sensitive or you suffer from eczema, like I do on my face, you have to be careful because this product may not work for you. It didn't work for me. My symptoms got worst."
2,Ho Hum,"Turned all of our faces white when we got in the water! :( its not for water sports, thats for sure. I own a houseboat so we go through about 20 bottles per summer, so I will stick to Hawaiian Tropics Sensitive Skin for faces. Other than that, it is scent free and worked without any burning issues."
5,A Nancy Wilson Christmas Indeed,"I have waited years for Nancy to do a Christmas album. I was so excited to discover this new CD. The last of the Jazz Divas has out done herself. It is jazz at its finest. This will certainly make my season bright. I hope you are working on your next CD, Nancy!"
3,Not Enough of a Chase,"On the fourth page, Ashmore Chase is described as ""horripilant like the porpentine against its foes,"" a description that should alert the reader to the fact that this is Innes at his most verbose and obscure. Obviously he has confused himself with John Donne, for every paragraph is as much as conceit as the author's writing of the novel. A few passages of wit in the middle sections are let down by the presence of three egregiously jejune and callow youths. Since the murder is committed three-quarters of the way through, and to the accompaniment of excessive coincidence and too many cardboard mad villains, there is little room for any interest in the crime, so the solution is as anti-climactic as it is unconvincing."
4,Good product,"I've used several thousand of these in my small business and have no complaints. They are sturdy and lightweight. Product arrived quickly, too."
4,Blues by Eddie Taylor,"Not bad if you like the blues. Eddie Taylor's guitar work and the band are great and his songs also are good. I wasn't too impressed with Floyd Jones. If you can get this CD for under $4.00, go for it. I REALLY wish Amazon.com would provide their sample songs on MEDIA PLAYER."
2,Perfect for teenyboppers,"This magazine is chock-full of celebrity gossip, schmoozy breakup stories and wannabes such as Lindsay Lohan and Hilary Duff dissing each other. If you're eleven years old, this may be what you want. But for anybody older than preteens, this magazine does no provide. Multi millionares complaining about how hard their life is issue after issue gets really old, really quickly. For more sophisticated teens, there are much better magazines available."
3,"Dumb, but fun","I know these books are trash. I buy them for posters.I'm 14 and the only time i actually read them is at mycamp when it's raining. Plus, that's a tradition, to buytrashy, cheap, filled with strictly gossip informationand read them and see how low people can go. I meanlook at Kate and John Gosselin. =[ oh well."
4,Pretty Good . . . There Are Better Ones . . .,"J-14 is a pretty good magazine. I like the ""Truth or Dare"", ""Totally Embarrasing Moments"" and ""Cool Comebacks"" the best. It has posters and a quiz in each issue. (With titles like ""Are you a Good Girlfriend?"" and ""Does He Like You?"" and ""Are You a Flirt?"") It has ""Winning Looks"", where they rate how stars look. In ""Totally Embarrasing Moments"", people write in about embarrassing moments they've had, and J-14 rates them as - ""You'll Get Over It,"" ""We Don't Know You,"" and ""Leave Town Now!!!"" In ""Truth or Dare,"" people write in about stuff they had to say or do ina game of Truth or Dare. J-14 will rate those as ""Total Daredevil,"" ""Pretty Risky,"" and something else I can't remember. In ""Cool Comebacks,"" people write in about cool comebacks they've made. Overall, it's a good magazine, if you're looking for something like that."
5,VERY COOL!!!!,"wow! I love this magizine, and it has hilary duff in it!( a total plus!!! )it has-embarassing moments,cool comebacks,the newest cleb pics,posters in EVERY issue,beauty tips,horroscope,tons of music,very intresting articles,and a zillion other things!!!!!I love this mag,and its so colorful, its hard to miss!!!!!its my fave, you Gotta get it!!"
5,Great!,"My daughter gets this magazine, along with a couple of others. It's the highlight of her day when they come in the mail. She reads it through as soon as she gets it!"
1,gets worse and worse,"The first time I bought J-14 was in 2010. From there to now it has gotten from good to horrible! Seriously the stories are very shallow, they focus on crushes and celebrities . They are boring and I don't recommend it to anyone."
3,J-14 Review,"First off, I'd like to say that most girls 8-15 find this magazine very interesting. I have to admit, I buy it myself sometimes. It is packed with pin ups, colums, advice, and so much more for the ""pop princess.""However, J-14 is probably, in my opinion, the teen version of The National Enquirer. I am saying this from my point of view, and someone who knows behind-the-scenes info, that J-14 makes up some of its articles. A lot of ""quotes"" are just a couple words here and there from different conversations, or actual quotes the artist has said. Once all these words are put together to form a new quote, yet another rumor comes up also. That's the only thing that I do not support in this magazine. Although, entertainment is entertainment, and you can't change that. Some magazines have to make up things to sell, and unfortunately, J-14 is one of them."
4,Good Case for my Roland XP-80,"I've had my workstation for about four years now, and it was stationed in my office where it lived, as I did not use it to perform in live settings. I bought the case to protect the workstation when I moved and since, I have used my set-up for a number of events. THE CASE: I think the case is great - perfect amount of room for my keyboards and I really like the interior ""tie-down"" straps - although you do have to be careful about tieing down your keys. There is an abundance of padding in a semi-rigid set-up. Of course, when your boards are in there, it becomes totally rigid. The wheels are a great addition when your arms are tired of lugging your boards around, which is pretty fast with the weight of them - bag is light. The large front pocket is great for cables, disks and other stuff. I originally wanted a soid case like an ATA or hard-shell, but this works really well for me. I wouldn't check it through baggage at the airport, but it's pretty tough."
2,"Older titles more fun, better bet...","Of all the Tonka titles, this one is the least rewarding for me (as a parent), and least played (by my 6 year-old). When I purchased this product, I thought I was getting another fine Tonka software product. I wasn't.The controls are keyboard-oriented, which makes it more difficult for a child to master. He is used to mouse-oriented controls (contained in the older Tonka titles). My six year old has a hard time remembering which key does what function. Even after playing if a few times, he doesn't enjoy it much.Also, the game simply isn't as fun. The latter titles offered more interaction...more diverse play scenarios. This title lacks the ""oomph!"" that carried the other games.If you're a first-time Tonka buyer, I'd reccommend either the Tonka Construction set or the Search and Rescue program. Oh, and be sure to check the system requirements before you buy!"
1,This can't be Tonka Joe,"We purchased this computer program thinking it would be fun and enjoyable like all the other Tonka Joe adventures. All we found was pure disappointment. My son is very proficient on the computer and easily does Tonka Construction 1 and 2, Tonka Garage, and Tonka Search and Rescue but this program is not only difficult for him but it is even difficult for me and his 12 year old brother. My son still loves Tonka Joe but I am very surprised in the difference in products and was considering Tonka Raceway but now I may even reconsider that purchase."
5,"Fun, with good visual effect","This is my son's favorite CD ROM game. It has variety of games to select with. I enjoy watching him play. However, he needs help with certain tasks. It is an exciting game which is not too difficult for children 5 and up."
5,I believe this is educational,"ok, all these Tonka games have been great for all 3 of my sons - 11,8 and 5 They have learned all the tools names, trucks and how they work. and Now they are learning tid-bits about rockets. I love these Tonka games. Great graphics - or so says my 11 year old."
1,The Plan 9 of Outer Space of Toscas!,"This version of Tosca is so bad it's funny. In a failed attempt to ""modernize"" the classic, the producers weigh down the story with hilariously inappropriate stage setups, including a tilted stage (at one point, Scarpia even has to grab a piece of furniture about to slide off into the orchestra pit!) that is actually fitting given the fact that the whole production is about to sink like the Titanic at any moment. The singers writhe and roll all over the stage, they go up and down on pulleys, clothes are ripped at, hairy chests are exposed (oh, brother!). All would be excusable if the singers gave us something new & great, or even good - they don't. The cast is not equal to the task, but is pretty to look at. Even the audience seems incredibly underwhelmed by the needless bombast and ham-fisted Broadway musical acting. And what is with the eyeball? Ugh, could you possible get a bigger sledgehammer to ram that metaphor home? C'mon, its Puccini, not KISS."
2,More of the Same,"This whole ""Greatest Hits"", ""Essentials"" and ""Best of"" nonsense is ridiculous. How many editions do we really need anyways?Add to this yet another inclusion of several tracks STILL appearing in their edited or ""Singles Version"" format and the whole thing gets pretty damned insulting and frustrating for those of us that are TRUE fans of The Doobie Brothers.Where are Neal's Fandango, Dark Eyed Cajun Woman, Mamaloi, Little Darling, I Cheat the Hangman, South City Midnight Lady, Daughters of The Sea / Flying Cloud, Another Park, Another Sunday,the very jazzy and thumped up version of China Grove or Slow Burn (from The Wilderness Concerts)?""Hits"", I suppose. ""Best of"", not hardly.Spend the extra few bucks, buy the originals, and do it yourself. Hey after all, if you want something done right..."
3,"This game is good for the preteens, or anyone!","Well, this game is a lot of fun to play with, a bit messy, but fun. It is not really educational though. I would say, reading Teen magizine is more educational than playing this game, but it is (in a way) worth the money....."
2,Tenat's Side of the Story,"I did enjoy learning about his early life and roots his father etc.Then my interest level started to ""wane"".He has many details which were not available to the general public up to this point.However, other than two or three details I learned, the book did not keep me deeply interested."
2,"No Footnotes, Much Opinion","Mr. Tenet is a great storyteller. The melodrama is rampant here. Where does the story end and the truth begin? There is only an index at the back of this book. No footnotes whatsoever. Other books that I have read from former gov't officials have copies of un- or de-classified memos and documents to back up their arguements. Arbitrary discretion does not inspire confidence in the story. It will always be a mystery to me as to the reasoning behind President Bush keeping this holdover from the Clinton administration on as CIA director. Mr. ""slam-dunk"" fails again.Fortunately, I waited to buy this from the ""bargain books"" list. Read the book, just take what he says with a grain of salt."
3,cdp man,"I found this very interesting and provided a background knowledge of events that were transpiring right under our nose. Although I believe a lot of fact, there was too much justifying, but that may have been necessary to cope with a very difficult time and responsibility."
4,An important contribution,"This is not the whole story. However, given his position it is inevitable that he is able to tell stories that no one else can. For that reason, it is a valuable read."
1,Rehash,"This is identical to ISBN 1559533706, Problem Solving Strategies. The authors have repackaged it with a new cover. There is no new material covered in this book."
1,Frustrating for my daughter,"My 2-1/2-year-old daughter received Glitter Glide for Christmas after asking for a ""My Little Pony"" toy. She was excited at first because the pony is very pretty and its crown lights up. However, she wants to take the skates off and use it to play with her other ponies, and this is not possible. So, she usually ends up putting it away in frustration and hardly ever bothers to make it light up or spin. I would recommend getting a regular ""My Little Pony"" over this one since they are more versatile."
5,Great Toy,"These Backyardigan toys are the perfect size for toddlers and my son loves them. We have washed them on the delicate cycle in our washing machine and they have held up well, although the tag indicates ""spot clean only"". Would reccomend to anyone with a toddler....there are no small parts."
5,Perfect gift for the little Backyardigan Fan,Character accurate stuffed animals. Larger than your typical Beanie Baby. My 3 year old grandson was enthralled by this gift
5,This record will bring great chi to your home or work,"I am using this record when I do house energy cleaning work, it has this amazing power to change all negative energies into positive healing vibration.This record has helped me a lot to be more positive and spiritually uplifted.Hope you have a chance to try it.Anita"
2,you think she's great?,"Hikki's fans, you always says that Mai-k always ripping off Hikki's style!! how rude!! >.< This album is so totally boring!! she just wanted to eat my money!!! It cost me so much amount of money and the songs is so.. yuck... She tries to make good songs but failed... ...Mnay people says that her songs are great but for me it's not.. If you want some good jpop songs you better heard Mai-k's that Hikki's..."
2,nothing to get excited about.,"This assemblage is nothing to rave about, I would suggest sticking with Mickey's own hits or music he made when on top."
2,The subject is appealing but the plot poorly executed.,"Although the reader can sympathize with Benny's learning disability, the other characters are disappointing and unrealistic. The father too cruel, the mother too weak, the sister too mean and his teachers oblivious. The fact that they haven't understood that he has a learning disability until fifth grade is appaling. Then, suddenly, the coach intervenes and everyone's personality changes overnight. Most of all, there is too much dialog between the adults in the story and not enough action centered around Benny."
4,A good book with industrial applications,very useful for industrial applications. There are quite a few printing mistakes and that would be a problem for those reader they are not very strong in statistics.
5,Page-turner from the Get Go!,"Nerdy but cute graduate student cracks a code and then is pursued by a lovely young lady. Coincidence? We think not! Add serveral near death experiences and even the most blase will be suspicious. The hero of this well-thought-out story is smart, clever and just quirky enough to be believable. You will find yourself having to read ""just a few more pages"" even though you are too tired to keep your eyes open, this book is a real page-turner. I don't want this to be a spoiler, so I can't go any further in my plot description (but don't trust the girl), but let it suffice to say that you will find this book exciting and entertaining! A rip-roaring read!"
5,beautiful earrings,"You don't have to love fishing to love these earrings. They are beautiful. Iridescent yellow and red, and a good size (slightly over an inch long)."
5,A Truly Lucas Gem!,"I bought this CD because of the first 3 tracks. Most tracks are the 12"" versions. I also like this because of the inclusion of ""Sometimes A Love Goes Wrong, Dreamer, and Street Corner Symphony"" with longer versions not to mention 2 versions of ""I Gotta Keep Dancin'. This is highly recommended."
5,The greatest modern war film,"We Were Soldiers has done something that no other movie has been able to do. The Vietnam war has long been shunned, and its participants dishonored. Those movie gives a new look at the start of the war, the feelings of the soldiers and their families, and a suprisingly human look at the enemy. Along with the usual host of action and surprises, you begin to care deeply for the people in the movie. If your cup of tea isn't usually war movies, I would highly recommend you make an exception for this film. It will seriously change your view of the Vietnam war and those who fought it."
3,It takes alot more than this to make a classic movie,"It takes alot more than this to make a classic movie... It takes alot more than realistic war action to make a classic movie. First, it can't be made by formula, the formula of so many, like Pearl Harbor for example. Classic, great movies take something much much more. Second, it can't have the ""dumbed down"" cheesy scenes for the first 45 minutes or so, the scenes so stupid and ""spoon fed"" to the audience... The bottom line is, movie making is a business. That extra box office money this business needs is why this movie is so dumbed down and really an insult to any intelligent movie fan."
5,Gibson at his finest,This movie is amazing. Look who is in it. This is one of Mel's best movies he has been in. Being a war movie fan this is one of my big favorites. It takes place during the Vietnam war at the Battle of Ia Dang Valley. Mel Gibson's charecter must lead the u.s's leser forces againest a huge force of Vietnamese. Gibson was a great role model in this movie. Every kid who was able to see this movie would want to be just like him unlike Nhicolas Cage's charecter in Windtalkers.
5,Not quite as good as Platoon but effective,Real life account of events of US Army Cav(the 7th) in Ia Drang valley in 1965. Good solid cast and awesome effects give this one a true-5 star rating even if Platoon is still the definitive Vietnam picture.
5,Great,"Great movie, but it should have been longer. To many important parts were cut. Anyone that sees the movie, should read the book. It makes it even better."
4,MIA,"One of the best movies I ever owned, Mel Gibson was fantastic in this exciting film about Americas first in counter in the Viet Nam conflict. I have replaced it twice."
5,Unlike the previous viewer I opposed the Vietnam War,"I opposed the Vietnam war and still do but my opposite number is right--this is a great movie (I also suggest the book and the ABC special where the soldiers return to the Ia Drang valley after thirty years) This movie isdedicated to the Americans AND Vietnamese who died during the battle of the Ia Drang. It is thoughtful, respectful of the enemy and gives our soldiers the credit they were denied when they came home. I have gotten into rows with ""Anti-War"" friends who protest any effort to glorify our soldiers. They talk the talk but basically were chickens--with ideology but no empathy. Communism has nothing to do with it. whatever The Vietnamese were as the book says a brave and worthy foe--and our soldiers (who the chicken anti-war movement jeered) were brave and worthy--heroes in what I regard as a monstrous war. I was crying after the movie. I was ashamed I did not go to Vietnam--even though I would have gone only as a medic."
5,"5-star movie, 0-star war....","Wars are the HELL on this planet & those who want war are just EVIL...There is no heaven, this it it!Good movie!!"
1,Makes one feel guilty.,"This movie was horrible,don't get me wrong i like my war films, and I am not the son of the devil, I found The Thin Red Line horrific, but this film had me in stitches, I was laughing so much and this made me feel very guilty. You know when someone is going to die, because something good has just happened to them. This film tries at one point to show the story not just from the americans side, but our hero from the other side runs along in dramatic slow motion only to have his head blown off. Mel Gibson just seemed to be his usual self, with no emotion this time, I didn't care what happened to these characters which since it is a true story made me feel more guilty. Watch Black Hawk Down, there's a very emotional war film."
5,HAUNTING MEMORIAL. THE ESSENCE OF THIS MOVIE LEFT AN INDELABLE MARK ON MY SOUL.,"I really liked this movie. I didn't nitpick the scenery or take fault with MEL GIBSON personally or any of the other issues some reviewers deemed important. I applaud MEL GIBSON and any and all who brought this movie to screen.This movie depicts a battle in 1965 (the VALLEY OF DEATH) where ""the rubber meets the road"" in the evolution of the war in VIETNAM (the first big time encounter for American military with the NORTH VIETNAMESE.) A BRUTAL beginning To a PROTRACTED BRUTAL WAR incorporating the effects of war on wives/families and combatants on both sides (which I found entirely appropriate and touching). Illuminating the HORROR, the military BLUNDERS, the BROTHERHOOD/CAMARADERIE, the COURAGE/DEVOTION, and the LOSS of COMBAT/WAR.This movie is not so much about what you see. It is about the VISCERAL (like I said earlier--the essence). Not what you see (as bad as it is), but what you are left to FEEL."
2,John Wayne would be proud !,"I am a fan of Mel Gibson movies, but this one was no Braveheart or Patriot. There have been alot of great war films like Platoon,Saving Private Ryan, Blackhawk Down, Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now. We Were Soldiers is not one of them. This film belongs in the B-grade section with films like Green Berets , Hamburger Hill, Casualties of War ,Thin Red Line etc.I thought the acting cheesy and the battles scenes were very unrealistic.If you love John Wayne movies then you will love We Were SoldiersIf you want to see a great war film grab a copy of Platoon or Blackhawk Down."
1,Horrible mess by Mel,"Has mr. Gibson got totally grandeur? This film is so bad as it could possibally be! Mel should be nominated to the Razzie award!It's very unpleasant to see him with those other young, welltrained bodies, and you can even see the sucking spirit in his eyes!"
5,Wow!,"Mel Gibson is such a great actor. He brings real life to the characters he plays and this movie is no exception. This is a first rate movie in any catagory. It truly captures, the way no other Holy-wierd film has, what it feels like to be in the thick of brutal combat.As a former United States Marine, my hope is that everyone who watches this movie will walk away with a much more profound understanding and appreciation of the cost of freedom we enjoy in this great nation. Our freedom is granted to us by the Warriors that our Armed Forces train; our freedom is not free.Watch this movie. If afterwards you can not better appreciate your citizenship in the USA, then....pick another country.Semper Fidelis!"
2,Long story,This movie is pretty long and it drags in spots. The movie is definitely okay but certainly not great. Not quite what I expected.
2,Overrated (....at least on Amazon),"This is a movie with excellent potential, yet it doesn't quite 'hit'. For one thing, Mel Gibson's war general accent seems totally fake. Especially given the way his character is portrayed. Character development, although attempted, turns out to be weak. Perhaps this is related to the fact that the fighting dominates the movie. In fact, the fighting sequences are the one part of this film that's great. Obviously director Randall Wallace wanted to show the non-stop killing and unrest, but he does so at the expense of the rest of the story. Also, the subplot of the wives back at home is interesting but poorly placed. Wallace jumps from brutal killing to the peaceful wives in a way that seems obscure and awkward.Perhaps I was hoping too much for another Saving Private Ryan or the like but instead its more of a detached experience of explicit brutality. Worth a watch; not the buy."
1,Utterly boring movie for war junkies only who don't like plots,"No attempt was made to make this movie entertaining. It's two hours of shooting Vietnamese soldiers, over and over again. I've seen TV movies handle this sort of material better. What a shame."
3,the women in this movie drag it down,"the women in this story drag the story but theres still some great action scenes in here with Mel Gibson(Braveheart and Signs) leading the men to victory...sometimes silly but all in all its an ok view..other cast includes Marc Blucas(Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Pleasantville), Dylan Walsh(Blood Work, Congo), Ryan Hurst(Remember The Titans), Madeline Stowe(Unlawful Entry, Impostor), Barry Pepper(Knockaround Guys, 25th Hour), Chris Klein(Election, Say It Isnt So), Keri Russell(Tv's Felicity), Sam Elliott(Road House, The Hulk), Greg Kinnear(Auto Focus, Dear God), Desmond Harrington(Ghost Ship2002, Wrong Turn), Don Doung(Green Dragon), Keith Szarabajka(Tv's Angel), Mike White(School Of Rock), and Clark Gregg(The Last Time I Committed Suicide, The Usual Suspects)"
1,We Were Soldiers,The disc would freeze off and on throughout most of the movie. I think I would have loved the movie had the problems did not exist.
5,Action movie with a Purpose,"I truly enjoyed watching this VN era movie. It was good insofar as being an action and war movie. But, what truly set it apart for me was that it contained both the triumphs and the errors that occur in the midst of kaos. The people portrayed faced difficult challenges and improvised on the spot to meet the pain head on. This is clearly one of the better war movies I have seen. Too many are simply violent for the sake of violence, or just anti war messages that disregard the truth for the sake of a making a buck and altering the viewers' opinions on a war."
4,The futility of war,"This movie drives it home very strongly how futile and painful war is. Hundreds of men sent to their deaths for no good reason, maybe that would have been a better name for this movie, ""For No Good Reason"".A very moving war story shown partly from both sides about the tragedy and suffering involved when 2 armies decide to take each other on, no holds barred, in a full frontal assault.Mel Gibson is true to form, a powerful and strong epic from a master actor and producer, he has been involved in many great movies over the last 25 years,and deserves full credit for yet another commanding performance, despite a few fopar's off screen, he really is a legend of the modern movie era."
4,Great war movie!!!!!,"Don't give up on this movie after the first half hour. The director, Radall Wallace (writer for Pearl Harbor)has a tendancy for emotional movies, but this is so for only the beginning of this movie. The next hour and a half is pure action and gore that rivals Saving Private Ryan. Great war movie that will keep you glued to the seat. Not many extras, but the ""making of"" documentary is pretty interesting.Don't watch this movie if you couldn't handle the gore and bloodshed of Saving Private Ryan!"
4,Excellent Music!,I have been trying to purchase a set of CDs for my BBQs' gatherings and this CD makes a great addition to my music.
3,the usual suspect,"I liked her other two books, but as a retired academic, I often tire of mysteries set on campus. This is especially true when the villain is so obvious, not because of any weakness in her plotting, but because in ""ivy"" mysteries the bad guys are so often those whom most of us in the arts would choose--let me be coy here--not students, not faculty, not staff, guess who."
5,Very good condition and read,"I just love how its set up. It introduces Isis story being told by her. Although it shows only a few chants and spells, it is mostly about the life of Isis and her associations. I really recommend this book and it is great to learn about the Goddess Isis and her many forms."
3,Average debut...but an unlikely sleuth..,"""Bloody Bonsai"" is the first of the Jim Dany series, and it is plainly average. Dandy is a retired physical therapist who was dragged into doing Elterhostel by his kids. He meets Doddie Swisher, and falls in love with her. In the meantime, a shady hotel clerk is found stabbed to death with get this-a bonsai tree. It is up to Jim and Doddie to solve the mystery and find the killer so they can be cleared. Blackmail and illicit love are two things they dig up."
4,Recommended.,"A very interesting book on an often misunderstood or little understood subject. Dispelling the myths, this book provides different angles or points of view to consider the jesuit experience in Latin America. Highly recommended to anyone interested in the subject or who may be intending to visit the argentinian-paraguayan missions."
4,thomas and friends,"i got this cd for my nephew. he already had this one,but he had scratched it to where it wouldn't play anymore. he loves thomas, so i thought i would get him another one.thanks Amanda Langham"
1,"Dull, uninteresting, poor","Pretty much a waste of money. A narrator goes through the 12 cuts, doesn't add anything new, and you spend a whole hour waiting to hear something interesting, unique or thought-provoking only to be disappointed. meh"
4,"Heck, even Billy Beane liked it!","And he gets bored with baseball books, according to his review on the sleeve. You wouldn't think a regular season game would be all that interesting that it would warrant a book. But the Yankees and Red Sox are perhaps the only two teams which a book like this could be written. The story flows very nicely and there are some interesting tidbits on certain players that you may not know about. Every perspective is covered in this book. Player, general manager, owner, and fan are all accounted for. I took off a star because of Kettman's epilogue that turned into a rant saying basically that the Yankees are evil and the Red Sox will someday win a World Series because of this wonderful group running the show. Hey Steve, if I want a Red Sox homer I'll listen to Peter Gammons okay? Other than that, this is a enjoyable book. Just stop after the game is over."
5,THIS CD STANDS ON ITS OWN!,"Over the years Michael W. Smith has proven he is an artist! However, this CD stands on its own! Unlike his previous projects, all of the songs on ""Worship"" are worship songs sung directly unto God, whose presence is very much felt (at least by me). I believe God anointed everyone involved so that this CD would bring ministry and healing to those listening. Each song is beautifully recorded with a huge choir featuring Gospel/Christian artists. Even if you're not a Smitty fan, this CD is a MUST-HAVE! And, even if you're not a Christian, this CD will touch your heart. I whole-heartedly recommend it!"
4,Smitty leads us in worship as well as ANYONE...,"He has a heart of gold, a passion for Christ, and a great worship-leading CD that I will listen to many, many times before I even begin to tire. He has great taste too, selecting great classics as well as a few that I never heard until I bought the CD. BREATHE, PURIFIED, and, especially, ABOVE ALL are beatiful expressions of God in song.Great upbeat songs: OPEN THE EYES OF MY HEART, LET IT RAIN, PURIFIEDGreat mellow songs: BREATHE, DRAW ME CLOSE, ABOVE ALLSmitty scores points from me for this worship album, but doesn't get 5 simply because everyone else IS doing worship CD's right now, he he."
3,Worship missed the mark for a MWS album.,"I'm in agreement with the editorial, this album leaned too heavily on ""songs of the day"" (popularity) including popular vocalists, INSTEAD of leaning on the spring of praise and worship that MWS has in his heart. With so much to draw from, he seemed to ""run dry"" for a moment and came up with this, or just maybe wanted to do something different. If that be the case, then it IS different,,,lacking in what has been notably MWS work to this date,,,ORIGINALITY AND ANOINTING. So, I recommend that Michael stop following Popularity and stick with Anointing, which in the end is what praise is all about."
2,not what I was expecting,"Even though the CD cover had many familiar titles, I thought ""well, this is Michael W Smith, they're going to be AWESOME."" Unfortunately, they aren't. Live worship CDs are obviously the current bandwagon and it's too bad MWS jumped on...this is a really mediocre effort that falls short of what we've come to expect from him. The pieces themselves ARE powerful, if you consider the lyrics of praise to the Lord. But, musically, this CD really isn't anything to write home about...it's lacking real punch that makes it sound different from the Maranatha/Hosanna worship CDs with which we're all familiar. Too bad, because he is such a talented musician and lyricist...he should have considered expending his efforts into developing more original worship works."
2,Are you kidding?,"I can't believe Michael W. Smith would allow something like this out with his name on it. If you are a devoted fan, the last 2 songs are worth having--the rest of the album is poorly recorded background music. This could be any singer. ""Michael, what happened?!"" Very disappointing."
3,The Corrs Live In London,Not any where near as good as Live at Albert Hall. The video format was weak as were the vocals.
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE.,"The ladies are lovely, the lyrics are sensational, but the sound track is horrible. Like listening with two paper cups over your ears.The levels are all wrong. The sound engineers need to remix. Maybe you can tweek your sound system and get better performance. I couldn't.Save your money on this one and go buy their Live at the Royal Albert Hall DVD or Blue CD, both are quality productions.My apologies to Jim, Sharon, Caroline, and little Andrea."
5,another brilliant single,"And what's so great about them, they remain brilliant though the music has changed a lot since 1996. This one is great again, although it can't beat Jonathan David as song of the year. After having listened to it, I feel a real desire to listen to Village green preservation society and Something else by the Kinks; The first two songs on this single resemble those albums in a way. It's a shame there are only 3 songs on it, but the band made up for that with their terrific peel session last june. I can't wait for a new album..."
1,Even more of the same,Just another band that couldn't write an original song if their life depended on it. STAY AWAY! Very far away if you like diversity in your music.
3,"Great equipment, wrong color",I bought this one in particular 'cause I thought it was silver... But it is green... It just think they should be more carefull with the pictures... Overall this is the best caliper for measuments of fat. Very precise..
4,It's a good product,"Lange skinfold caliper It's just a good product, nothing more then this, but as a common instrument we can trust on it"
1,Name Dropping and Fame Seeker,"If you're looking for a fluffy read about celebrities and true crime at it's most shallow, this is an interesting read. But there are no insights, and no deep revelations. The author was painful to listen to for his shameless name dropping. He gave me the impression that his career has been spent trying to cozy up to the rich and famous to bask in their glow."
5,A factual account of the major trials,This is a MUST read for any law student.It is also great reading for all the trial watchers.Too bad Dominick Dunne is no longer with us to continue his excellent work.
2,Name-Dropping at its best......,"I've admired Dunne's work in VANITY FAIR, so I was really looking forward to a true crime work by him.As far as I could tell, the entire purpose of this book was for Dunne to name drop, from Betsy Bloomingdale to La Comtesse de la Farge (I made that last one up). No crime or investigation was complete without Dunne letting the reader know whom HE knew who had a big name, and how much that person admired him. I am a huge fan of true crime, and I found so little of that in this book that I was surprised it was listed as such. If you love true crime, I would recommend you NOT buy this book."
2,A Stale Helping of His Previous Work,"I have never read Mr. Dunne and thought that I would enjoy his fresh and unique perspective on recent criminal trials. Unfortunately, all of the vignettes have been previously published in Vanity Fair and little or no effort has been made to update them for subsequent developments. As such, anyone with more than a casual interest in the subjects (Menendez, OJ, Safra, etc.) will have already heard 99% of what he has to say. His prose is somewhat cumbersome and the celebrity gossip and relationship details where he has genuine insight and access are often presented in a confusing manner. Mr. Dunne could have written a much better book had he updated and critiqued his previous work, accounting for new events or noting where his original opinion had changed. Unless you are fortunate enough run in his social cricles, or else your name appers in print on its pages, you are better to leave it on the shelf."
3,Homeworld: Game of the Year Edition,"As one of the oldest windows video games I had always enjoyed the complexity of this game, and the strategy aspects of it. The navigation controls of the game were some of the most original I had seen.If there was one thing I have to say against it would be that it is difficult to get running under operating systems like Windows XP and Vista since these systems compatibility with older games has always been lacking.Other than that I have always enjoyed the experience playing it."
2,Not Fun,"I'm surprised whenever I read a game review. The reviews are usually too long and don't spend enough time covering the disadvantages of games. Plus,there's a bias in that many of the folks who write a review are those who seem to have had a positive experience. I played the first six missions of Homeworld. The game is interesting and has potential, but I found the user interface to be terribly awkward and cumbersome. I played the game ""Starcraft"" and loved it. As for Homeworld, I learned the rules and all, but it didn't seem like much strategy was involved -- just seemed like a matter of building more ships to kill the enemy, and then working the controls to get your ships to go where you want. My advice is to play a demo of this game before forking over the cash. If you like this stuff, then great. If the user interface becomes less cumbersome, then I'll probably buy future versions. That's all."
1,Homeworld- WORST Game Of The Year Edition,This game is horrible! If yur thinking about buying this game reconsider...unless u like like sitting in the middle of spacewith a bad battle system and a crummy soundtrack. If u didwant this game get StarCraft. IT ROCKS!!!!!!!!!
1,"Great ITEM, horrible SERVICE","I bought The Melody Book because it is a required textbook for a class I am taking. I ordered this book about a month ago and it finally came. I've needed it for class before now but have had to make due - the shipping on the item says to give it an extra 9-13 days... That time span came and went a while back.This book arrived damaged. I paid for NEW because I wanted a high quality, no hidden defects, item. It looks as if this book was made without a back cover and they had to try and put the cover on as an afterthought. Because of its poor construction, the back cover is also RIPPED along the binding.I would return this item, but as I have stated before, I need the item NOW and this will have to do. However, I am extremely disappointed in my purchase."
4,Detailed but interesting reading,"I never knew until I read this book, how little is really known about playgoing in Shakespeare's time. Much has to be deduced from adding a letter here, to a playbill there, to an essay from somewhere else. Gurr is an excellent writer and does a great job in this book of making such a collection of details interesting reading. He also does an absolutely outstanding job of drawing conclusions based on evidence and not filling in the blanks with guesswork. He discusses the theaters, the actors, the audiences, dress, classes, and touches on dozens of contemporary topics including the plague, pickpockets and cutpurses, the weather, and prices. There are a couple of appendices with interesting lists of surviving documentary evidence regarding playgoing."
3,"Still Love Fruba, but....","It was super-difficult to understand this one! Not once, but TWICE does it look as though Tohru is about to kiss someone - does she or doesn't she, with the drawings I couldn't tell! The way we jumped back and forth during flashbacks, and from character to character, it was really hard to understand the story. Mostly it's about Kyo's past, but the last part of the book is dedicated to Yuki and his older brother, and the feelings Yuki has for Tohru. One plot line with Kagura and Kyo seemed to be totally dropped. BTW, even though rabbit kid is on the front cover, he doesn't have a part in this book - he's mentioned once or twice.Still love this series; it annoys me in so many ways, esp. Tohru, but for some reason it's addictive. It's like my soap-opera (and I prefer it to watching desperate housewives lol)."
1,too bad there isn't a choice for '0' stars...,"(...) This product is junk and so is the documentation. I gave this to my brother as a gift. I just returned it along with a long letter to the company. I have a good understanding of computers and after 5 hours of torture trying to get it to work, I gave up.The manual is obviously written by someone with 3rd grade writing skills. It also assumes the reader has been installing drivers for the last 3 years in a shop somewhere. I can't imagine how novices would get this drive installed. Finally, you know the product's bad when a yellow piece of paper insert says, 'check with us before you return this product...' I called the number and received a recording that was not helpful and left a message that was never returned. I'll try another brand."
2,Bittersweat in NY,I was very excited to get the burner i mean hey i went from a 4X to a 24X but you have to know plenty about computers to get this thing going sometimes. They always say its an easy installation.. I got news for them perfect installations are in there dream land. Once i got the thing working it works all right. but if you aren't very good with computers go with a name brand its worth the extra bux. PS there is a TOLL FREE TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR THIS BURNER THOUGH. I called it once i got through i had to listen to faqs for 5 minutes and the tech support guy didn't speak good english but its better then nothing...ok its really not.. the number just in case anyone really needs it is 18008830206
1,Don't buy this,"This manufacturer cares nothing about support or a quality product - only your money. I received the 24x10x40x for Christmas. It is 3 full days now that their support number has been constantly busy and E-mails are ignored. The ""installation manual"" seems to be written for Electrical Engineers and is in poor english as well. Expect to spend half a day just putting it in your computer, and an unknown number of days trying to get it to work. ""Masters"", ""Slaves"", and ""Jumpers"" are words I don't like anyway but you'll see them in the manual. At one point my computer wouldn't even boot! I would have taken it back already but don't feel like spending another half day just to remove it. Maybe that's what they want?"
4,Short and Sweet,"I finished this book in a few hours, given I did not practice the exercises assigned (I plan to do those later). Based solely on the content, the book is short and sweet. The chapters get straight to the point and the author is kind with her advice. Bach addresses every basic topic about writing, from using exciting verbs to presenting manuscripts. It is informative yet brief, and it is for that reason I suggest cross referencing to fully understand these topics (when needed). For example, she spoke about character sketches, which at the time, I had no clue what that was, so I needed to go somewhere else to figure that out. This book is a simple guide through the world of writing a great story. You may need to reference additional material on writing fiction. Nonetheless, this book sits at the right corner of my desk. Great advice. Excellent tool for quick referencing."
4,Great for those of us still using old-fashioned corded phones!,"This was a replacement for an older model that finally gave out. I keep one old-style corded phone hooked up 'cause their reliability still beats wireless options in case of emergency, and having one of these retractable cord thingies is a must if you don't want to deal with a constantly-tangled ""curly"" cord. The connections between the cords themselves and the phone jack connectors seem a little flimsy, but I had the same impression on the first one we bought and it lasted almost 15 years, so no complaints there."
5,one of the best fusion albums ever!,"plain and simple this is an amazing cd from start to finish. chad covers all styles and plays them flawless. he also knows how to put a great gruop together as well. i will agree that this is a holdsworth ""showcase"" in many respects but it also has some of his best playing in years and he is just restrained enough to not lose the listener, this is a must have for any serious jazz/fusion fan. anyone claiming this is muzak is deaf and should stick to there kenny g cd's."
2,"Too technical, overly difficult to read","I love turtles, so I bought this book so that I could learn more about them, but it happens that this book is overly technical, too good for a Biologist or anyone studying Biology, but over the top for a person who just wants to pass the time and enjoy a good read. Full of statistics and data, this put me out of finishing this book, so I stopped in the middle of it. A great mistake having bought it."
4,Wokini,"The Amazon posting suggested this product was in Hardback format, but I received the paperback version. The price was very decent, so I did not send it back and raise any issues. This is not the first time someone has listed a book in hard copy on Amazon and then sent me the paperback version. The book was in good condition and the price was very good, but it was not what I was hoping for in the end."
3,more like a summary book,"it is a good book for general practicionaires, but not for rheumatologists.also helpful for nurses in rheumatology departments."
1,Huh?,"""Huh?"" about sums up this rather silly book. The extremely brief summaries of the more notable Celtic saints is plush with legends that no critical, modern mind could put on a level above fairy tale. Granted fairy tale can be very educational, but there is no room in Sellner's summaries for a modern critique of what these legends indicate about the mind or faith of the hagiographers, much less the actual saints. [...]"
1,Awful!!! So disappointed,I saw this novela for the first time when it came out way back in the day. It has always been my favorite story. My sister bought me this DVD for my birthday I was so exited to watch it. I got cozy in my bed and the first thing I noticed was that in the main menu it didn't even have the theme song of the novela. I didn't mind but was a little taken back I should have known that this was just the start of my disappointment. The story is really bad edited. It will make no sense at all if it's your first time watching it. And if you already saw it it's just a BIG dissapointment! Save your money people and shame on you Televisa!!!
5,Twigg's Burnin'/Confessin' the Blues Review,"My friend Eddie gave me this CD a little more than a year ago. It was the only CD I played in my HUMMER for the next 2 months.Esther Phillips was a very talented songstress. For anyone not familiar with her sound, Esther's singing voice is most comparable to that of Nancy Wilson. However, Esther is quite sassy and sings about topics that Nancy wouldn't dare record.""Burnin"" has a jazz flavor, not bluesy. Every song on this CD is a hit and my personal favorite is ""Long John"", more of a Dr. Feel Good than a dentist.The CD keeps me smiling, popping my fingers, singing, and rocking when I am on the road as if I were reliving Esther's performance at the Pied Piper over and over again.I'm purchasing this CD for another friend who I know will enjoy Esther Phillips as much as I do and will want to share this treasure with other friends. The CD is priceless."
4,A wonderful collection.,"It is a wonderful collection with a lot of hits greatest hits. But he has had so many that it would be impossible to to make a real best of. However, it is a wonderful cd and a pleasure to own.Review by Michael Peters. Please let me know if this review is helpful so I can write better in the future. Thanks."
4,Steve needs a double...,"...cd that is to really, really, capture all his best and greatest hits. On this collection I would have booted off ""THE STAKE"" for ""SACRIFICE"" and added ""GOING TO THE COUNTRY"", ""YOUR SAVING GRACE"" and one of Steve's best song's, always overlooked for these compilations, the very sweet, ""I LOVE YOU"" - and about 'leventeen other songs that would of made a nice 2-disc comp., at say, the $22-24.00 dollar range, and brother you would sit back and watch the bucks come in. Hey...this is still the best single collection out there, and they were so close to getting it right, that it is indeed worth your cash and time. If you want to round out this collection with another nice companion cd, check out ""BEST OF 1968-1973"" as well as 1972's ""ANTHOLOGY"" (""I LOVE YOU"" is on this one.) These are great early collections, and I would personally start with ""ANTHOLOGY"". Enjoy..."
4,puh-leeeeeeeeeez.....,"Look, first of all, if u look closely, the other side of his hair IS blue. Second of all, the manufacterers tried to do a mohawk in his hair. Third of all, PUNKS R SUPPOST TO LOOK LIKE THAT AND YASMIN IS ONE OF THE WORST PRETTY N PUNK DOLLS!!! The best ones my opinion r Jade, Cloe, and this one. Oh and also, they r made to be tourists cause they all have a suite case(if u didnt notice)*sigh* above all, this is a good doll.hope u enjoy it!!!!^-^"
3,not really helpful,"This book, although intriguing from the title, does not show you how to kill your girlfriend's cats. Comic pictures at best describe something that should be given a step by step manual. Like: use rat poison in the water. Put in microwave. Hold underwater. Don't feed. Any of these ideas are not given the proper explanation."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,I threw this product away because when I placed this product down my drain it actually made my pipes worse. I found it ineffective and a waste of money.
2,This stuff works !,"My husband and I have been using other brands of Glucosomine for 7 or 8 years. It helped but was no miracle. After finding out that this brand was the only one that was tested and proven effective, we switched over to it. That was 6 months ago. After about 3 weeks - we noticed a major improvement in our flexability and reduced level of joint pain. We are now able to do a lot of activities that we either could not do last year at this time or do them with considerably less pain."
3,Very little other refs available,"Since there are few references available on point types, this was added to my reference library. Disregarding the prices, for the types, descriptions, etc. I have the Texas type book also. What puzzles me is why Overstreet has listed some types for Texas, which are not covered in the current Texas book, nor any of the old books (and I have them back to the second or so book from the 1960s). Example is the Texas point type Overstreet calls Edwards. Not in any other Texas books I find. No explanation by Overstreet. Not a bad reference for types, just wish there was a better one available, more akin to the 1960s book from Texas."
2,yo-yo sexy girl,"it was just okay. i like yo-yo girl cop, but yo-yo sexy girl cop was a bit too much for me."
5,MC Solaar is ILL,"I had heard Solaar a few times as a kid while travelling in France and remembered liking his music. So recently, on a whim, I picked up Prose Combat. I was hooked after just listening to it once and had to share my excitement for this album with all of my friends. Solaar flows like no one else and the music has a smooth, sexy tone to it. It passes over the harder beats and powerful hooks of much American hip hop for a slicker, jazzy nightclub feel. It conjures images of a smokey Parisian dancehall with a sultry crowd. It is the first album that I've bought in a while that I just can't stop listening to. Solaar's mellow flow makes him perhaps one of the best MC's I've ever heard (although I can't comment on the lyrical content as my French is poor). Check out Solaar if you get the chance..."
4,A powerful and beautiful read,"An eloquent and powerful call for compassion, this book offers a succinct and highly readable presentation of material not commonly found in self-help books or popular psychology books. Brilliantly chosen literary references introduce the ten short chapters and attest to the timeless truths presented here. I had a profound experience reading this book. It is a gem."
3,Second half esp. worth watching; maybe skip first 20 mins,"The second part of the film, starting at about 25 minutes in, is especially worth watching. Until then, it is very typical of what you often can see on TV, with a lot of time spent discussing UFO sightings so as to convince us there's something out there. In that time for me, I didn't see anything new that I haven't already seen in other similar movies and TV shows (except for the mention that they thought that what happened at Fatima--the sun coming out of the sky--was a UFO). It's only the second part of the film that gets to the analysis of what may be going on and to the ""conspiracies."" I thought the ideas about hypnotism ""loosing the spirit"" was especially interesting. I originally gave this film two stars due to its dull beginnings (and straightforward dullness to begin with) but then changed it to a three upon watching the second half a couple of times."
3,I expected much better,"I found this movie to be disappointing on many levels. I found the first part of the movie to be very information, where they documented famous alien encounters. Then, the movie really went downhill. I was expecting to hear a lot of information on how these UFO sitings were spoken of in the Bible, because I have heard a lot of really great talks on this subject, but the movie barely spent 15 minutes on this.The movie also referenced accounts people had given while under hypnosis. These accounts are absolutely unreliable. Hypnosis has been proven to cause false memories..Also, the movie was very short. Overall, a disappointment!"
2,Way dissapointed,"The original Homeworld blew me away. From that amazing opening sequence with the Addagio for Strings music throughout the rest of the game. Everything about the game was revolutionary. Game play and intense storyline. Which is why I was greatly disappointed with Cataclysm. Cataclysm didn't invoke any sentiment and failed to completely draw me into the story as did the original. The Catacysm story is a complete waterdown compared to the original. The possibilities in ship building and technologies becomes limited compared to Homeworld. The game is a complete step in about every aspect from the original, except for some nice surrounding graphics. I was very very very very very very disappointed with this. A definitive second rate sequel. I wish I had never heard of this sequel, worse yet played it. I recommend sticking to the original Homeworld. This one will only mar the memory of the original."
2,Get it together!!,"This game has great graphics, but that's about it. The storyline definately needed improving along with the horribly robotic sounding voices. The additions to this game (like support modules and science modules) were the worst. A word to the wise get the original, it is one of the best games I've played. Sierra, I know you guys can come out with more levels and stuff for the original come on!!"
3,"Does Amazon really care ? "" Not happy""","If Amazon really cares then they should do us a favor and change the picture of the sage Curtain to "" What is actually Looks like..""This curtain is more like yellowish green, nothing like shown on the picture...Not happy ..."
5,Love it!,The shower curtain I bought for you was exactly what I ordered. It came in a timely manner. It works perfectly in my bathroom. It is modern and sleek and simple and I love it! Thank you!
3,"Nice curtain, but ""sage"" isn't as shown in images...","I bought this curtain to coordinate with the 1920's sage tile in our bathroom. The tile border includes multiple shades of sage, so I thought that an acceptable match would be fairly easy. Unfortunately, this curtain was a fairly strong yellow green, similar to PMS 372 (google Pantone Color Chart*)in daylight. If that color works in your bathroom, this curtain is an excellent buy. It's very well made.(*Note--A color chart on a computer is subject to the color rendition of the monitor, of course...so PMS 372 on your computer will probably not exactly match the color of the curtain as you see it in your home.)"
2,Does not have snap on liner like the video shows,"The video showed that you could use a snap on liner with this curtain...which you cannot do. That was the only reason I wanted this curtain. So you basically don't use a liner with this curtain, it just sits inside your tub...which I think looks kind of funny. That being said...it seemed like it was made of good materials and the hooks seemed pretty strong. I did return it though so I could get a curtain with a snap in liner."
1,Motor makes funny noise,"I bought this a while back and had trouble scheduling my handyman to come and put it in because we had those huge storms the first of July. When he finally got it in, the motor makes a very loud hum. He took it down and checked it carefully and put it back up and the noise is still there. I went to Lowes and bought another fan for him to put up and I'm trying to decide if I should return this. I thought it would be a better quality fan because it is a Hunter and I have ceiling fans all over my house - all but one of them a ""Hunter"" and none of them makes a noise like this one.Laura"
5,My Cool Kitchen fan,"We just love our new kitchen fan. It is so quiet and really does the job.Ease of installation, our son put it up for us in place of a 25 year old one.Of course Hunter is the brand for fans."
5,This one's a DIYer's dream!,"Excellent product, solidly made; clear assembly/installation instructions. Silent vibration-free operation; works superbly in 12' x 12' bedroom. (I prefer running fan pulling air upwards, for gentler airflow.)Some have commented on a gap between the fan housing and ceiling; when installed per Hunter instructions, the gap is 5/8"" -- not objectionable at all to me, and it becomes invisible in time. The gap serves a dual purpose: sound isolation, making the fan truly 'whisper'-quiet; also beneficial ventilation for the fan motor.Consider installing with Westinghouse Saf-T-Brace to provide super-solid mounting; and with Lutron SFSQ-SH-WH 3-speed (plus off) wall switch -- both available from Amazon.Hunter 23866 Lowprofile III 42-Inch 4 White Plastic Blades Ceiling Fan, WhiteWestinghouse 01100 SAFETY BRACE General Light Fixture PartLutron SFSQ-FH-WH Electronics Slide-To-Off Fan Speed Control, White"
2,Anemic air movement,"I selected this fan for a covered patio. You can only feel a small breeze if you are sitting directly under it, and the fan is on high. I should have bought a fan with a larger diameter blades, and more wattage. It's installed so I'll live with it, but have added another portable fan to help cool people on the porch since the Hunter is of little use."
2,Low profile fan,"Shortly after the fan was installed, there was a terrible clunking noise.My son is away in the Navy so I have no way of re-installing or checking out the unit. I haven't used it since. Did not realize there was this rating system."
1,"Not Flush to Ceiling, Low Quality","I have seen another review to this effect on here and then commentary from the peanuts. I mounted this fan to a box directly to a joist and used the mounting bracket. Bottom line, if you look at the bracket, there is NO way for it sit flush with the ceiling, I'm not sure how others are achieving this.The fan is also of lower quality with a flimsy housing, I paid $71 for it, would NEVER pay the current asking price of $90+!!!"
3,Disappointed,Item is cheap and flimsy. Will bend quickly. Opens cans but won't last. Only reason I gave it three stars was because of the quantity for the price. I figure it kind of evens out.
2,She Really Doesn't Play Nice-by Joel,"Firstly,she's one of the worst named artists ever:hear""Verbalicious''!How stupid!I think she said it exatly means ''verbally vicious'',to describe her type of music.Anyway,she hasn't any special skill in music,and it's not only this!She has a enervating voice.I just know it because I downloaded this song when I read about her first in Smash Hits.Don't spend even 3cents in this CD-single.She's another one of these artists that people will forget her appearance in 1 second.Saw that she sings a bit rap and a bit pop-r'n'b???"
2,Not enough Drills,Its a very basic book. Not so much focused on drills but more so on stretching and the difference between the guys game and the girls game. It was more of an autobiography of the author than a coaching tutorial. I would have liked something that had more drills and game tactics
3,hard as a rock,I really like this product .The nail hardener really works .I never had my nails grow so beautiful .I would recommend this product .
4,Long sought,The product is great. One of the features is that you don't have to keep your hand in the drying booth for 5 or more minutes. And as it says it is a great hardner.
2,Shuddup and walk!,"This is not so much a ""History of walking"", but is rather ""The author thinking and talking about other people thinking and talking about walking, either their own, or someone else's"".At least three levels of removal from people actual walking anywhere and seeing or doing anything. An academic's idea: armchair exercise.The book is nicely written, pleasant reading, with all sorts of learned bits and pieces. However, if you're looking for accounts of people actually walking, hiking, exploring, touring, etc., that is: actually doing something and not just cogitating about it, better look somewhere else."
1,Skewed and Political!,This is ridiculous. Nowhere in this book is there written an adequate history of walking. I have walked all over this great nation using many steps and styles of walking. There is no mention of it in this book! Ridiculous! To omit the great footprints of great walkers such as Abraham Lincoln and Benjamin Franklin is a travesty. This book is a woefully inadequate to describe the history of walking and is inconclusive in its methodology of step-taking.
5,Now I know why I love walking,"The free writing style fits the content well. As a compulsive walker, she speaks to what moves me to move, As an advocate for active transportation, it speaks to the reason to encourage more walking beyond just traveling from point to point. Highly recommended for wonks and easy walkers alike."
2,too small,they are not 5x.i would not recomend them to any body.i was very dissapointed in length and width.not worth the 30.00 dollars
3,sweat pants,soft and comfortable. but the leg length is not long enough for men 6 ft 6 inches tall. cant recommend for tall men like me. they need to be 2 or 3 inches longer in leg length
3,hey ~ they are sweat pants.,"So how can you go wrong? Right? Well, they are not as LONG as I expected....and the man is tall! Was hoping for a bit more length."
5,great sweat pants,"I have purchased multiple pairs of these sweat pants. They have a much better construction than most other comparable products. Are very comfortable. As a warning, if you have some one special living with you, I would suggest purchasing at least 2 pairs. My fiancee is constantly stealing mine. Sadly I have noticed 2 problems with these sweat pants, first: when buying, purchase one size larger than you think you need as they will shrink some when they are first washed. This can cause problems if the pair you bought ""just"" fits. The first pair i got rode up my legs more than I like after the first wash. But if you get one size larger when buying it will counteract this small flaw. Second: the Drawstring ties do not like to hold there knot and come undone all the time. Add an extra knot and this also is easily fixed.All in all, the best sweat pants i have ever gotten, and I will undoubtedly be getting more in the future."
2,Quite boring,This game gets boring after an hour or two. The interface is a bit confusing at the beginning.
3,Maybe if you really love these kinds of games....,"...For about two weeks, this was my life, I played Monopoly Tycoon all the time, even dabbling in the multiplayer thing on Gamespy (by the way, Gamespy is a terrible network, most people seem to be connected to the internet with a can and string). However, after those two weeks, I quickly lost interest.Some scenarios in the game are rather fun. Fast paced, beat the computer type things. If you enjoy games where quick decisions and figuring out ways to break down the competition, then this game is for you. This is a bit like The Sims on steroids, after the side effects have kicked in. While it's fun, it's not the best game in the world... however, people who really enjoy this genre of games, in my opinion, will love it."
1,Broken,UPON RECEIVING THIS PRODUCT IT DID NOT WORK. I paid to have it shipped and would have had to pay to return it. It wasn't worth it. So now I have a broken video game that was a complete waste of money!
1,Too easy to beat.,"Monopoly Tycoon is a continuation of the other Tycoon games. However, the levels are too easy to beat. The time clock on the game is too fast. An hour in game time takes just 30 seconds. A day is over in less than five minutes. On each level, you have to start over from scratch. You lose all of the property you bought and developed on the previous level. The best thing I can say about it is that I didn't pay too much money for it. I would recommend you find a free download and play it and save your money."
1,Didn't like it at all.,I enjoy Sim games so much that I got this game for my kids last Christmas thinking they would really like it since they love Monopoly.I was wrong. This game needs a doctor because something is definitely lacking. It wasn't what I thought it would be at all.I think the fact that the challenge is a short amount of time is what was the worst aspect of it.
1,will not download into my computer,I have such difficulty downloading this dvd game .. it simply will not download well enough for me to use it..I hope no one else has this problem.. I plan on sending it back.. but I am sure the cost of sending it back will be more than the re-embursment..
5,TaeBo II,This TaeBo is such a great workout video. It will have you sweating off those calories in NO time at all. It's awesome. I use it every other night
5,Amusing and highly effective,"I have to say I enjoyed this workout much more than I thought I would after reading the various negative reviews that ones have posted. Instead of finding the ""out-of-synchness"" and various other blunders on the part of both Billy and his team annoying, I found it amusing. These imperfections do not make the workout any less effective. My heart was pumping like crazy, I was sweating from head to toe, but was having so much fun that I didn't want it to end, even after the full hour! If you have a sense of humour AND want a wicked workout that will burn 800 calories, this one is for you!"
3,"Good, but a little crazy!","I really enjoyed that first series of Tae-bo and found it very affective. So when I decided to try this dvd I was very excited about it. I must say, it will get your heart rate up, but this time around Billy seems to smoke crack before he starts the workout. He moves very fast and changes his movements so rapidly that it's hard to follow. I'm sure it gets easier the more you do it, but when learning a new routine, this work-out is a challenge.Good luck to all! :)"
3,Chicken girl,"The video does not have the balance I would have liked; Billy Blanks does not always do both sides. Or, it is more excessive on one side than the other. The worst part of the video is Shelly (short hair, brown two pc. in the first class, turquoise blue outfit in second). She reminds me of a scrawny little chicken. I cannot stand her hollering throughout the video and her gross crotch sweating. The good aspect of the video is that it gets me to exercise for approx. one hour straight."
5,Billy Blanks IS THE BEST!!!,"I was a devoted follwer of his original tapes, so when these came out I was VERY eager to try them. They are FANTASTIC!!! They are more intense than the originals and more fun! They continue to challenge me, and I get bored easily. The cardio level is comparative to running or spinning, and you tone your whole body doing it. It keeps getting better!Highly reccomended!!!"
1,Plain old garbage,just a waste of $15. I typically give every movie a chance and even wanted this one to end decent but it was a waste. Woody's acting has hit new lows. Don't bother even renting.
2,Misleading and hard to follow,"When I watched the trailer for this I thought it looked like Training Day Lite, in reality it shouldn't even be mentioned in the same sentence as that movie. Rampart is a hard to follow movie, about a cop who crosses the line and then continues his downward spiral throughout the movie. I found it boring, with very little action and a complicated plot to follow. The acting was solid, but if you want action don't look here. Don't be fooled by the trailer like I was."
2,waste of time,"movie did not grasp my attention and I would not push it on anyone, maybe for the right veiwer but not my style"
3,Not bad..,Pretty good story of a corrupt cop who doesn't think he's doing anything wrong. It shows how he poisons everything he comes in contact with including his own children. Woody's character is not a character you will like unless you lean towards the extreme-right of the political spectrum.
2,boring,"Thought that Woody is playing a tough brutal cop here and there might be some action.He actually is a kinda good cop who is sometimes kicking some asses. But the whole movie is slow. I would neverplay that movie for a movie night with friends. It is just too boring. No action really.I am just watching it and waiting and waiting and waiting for some action or thrill. But no. It is just about a copwho got hated probably by some guys and they pulled a lil accident just to get him in rage and kicking the guy in his guts. Just to tape that kind of cop brutality. Now whats happening? nothing really. Maybe I will see Woody in court real soon.Just seeing a cop walking around, talking and fxxxing around. Nothing else really.Not worth really to buy it. I would prefer comedy or action movies. I need to be entertained somehow. I enjoyed rather wathing THE HELP. There is more going around and it goes under your skin."
1,No one to like,"Skip this movie unless you love being depressed. There is no one to like or care about in this, just a selfish scumbag leaving desolate people in his wake. Not one thing is redeemable about the character, the writing, the acting or the movie."
1,no redeeming qualities,Dark scrambled story of detestable LA cop stumbling from one depressing scenario to another in completely unbelievable story with no redeeming features. This is one of the worst movies available to rent on Amazon. Save your money unless you enjoy watching paint dry. How could so many decent actors sign up for such a terrible film? This movie needed a script! My wife gave up on it about 15 minutes in...I decided to give it another try later in the night....I...could...NOT finish watching it....the movie had no one the viewer could give a damn about. How does stuff like this get made?
2,Put me to sleep,"The negative reviews about this movie were correct, there was no brilliant performance by woody Harrellson who I actually like as an actor. This was a exercise in futility. He is a crappy corrupt cop in his own twisted and completely unbelievable delusional character who continues to defy the law with his vigilante justice all the while completely oblivious to the fact of how screwed up his personal and professional life is, I didn't expect a lot of action but I expected a better plot, the plot was convoluted and slow and it never had a chance to go anywhere as it pretty much started out slow and got even slower. The character interactions were bad and forced and in general not believable especially the lead character. If you have insomnia then this is the perfect cure."
2,Not as expected.,"The trailer is better than the entire movie itself, so don't bother to watch the whole thing. Read the cliff notes version on wikipedia."
1,Skip it.,Dreary and depressing are the good points of this film. I would not and will not recommend this to anyone.
3,Just ok...,"Was hoping for something more. Woody Harrelson is great in this movie, but the story line just gave up the ghost."
2,like Woody but not a good movie!,The movie does not fully add up and way too long without Woody this movie would have never been released!
1,DO NOT BUY,"This is not a straight razor for shaving. Do not buy this razor. It doesn't even look pretty. The scales are poorly made, the blade is crap. It is just a glorified pocket knife, and a very poor one at that. It will not shave, nor will it hold an edge. If you want to buy a Chinese razor, buy a Gold Dollar."
2,Kriegar Pearl Handle Folding Straight Razor,"The product was very poor quality, as expected for such a low price, came closed so much it damaged the blade and was very very hard to open at first, i wouldnt recogment getting this as it would cost more to make it sharp enough to shave with than the item is even worth."
5,PERFECT!!!,"The newest album by the eels is by far the best. After listening to it numerous times I've decided that it is one of the best albums I've ever listened to. It is much more complex and I dare say experimental than previous efforts, AND it toally rocks, marking a sharp contrast to the more acoustic, laid back previous album, ""Daisies of the Galaxy."" The first single, Souljacker Part I, has all the makings of a smash hit. If Dreamworks records decides to actually promote this album,it will be HUGE. I doubt it, however, since they did little to promote previous albums. In that case, this will remain a hidden gem. Do yourself a favor and be one of the few to own this album."
4,E is a rockin'!,"I dig the Eels. I bought E's first solo album when it first came out. In fact, I even saw him open for Tori Amos during her first tour. He was good then. He's a master of his craft now.I dig the Eels. When I heard the Eels for the first time, I didn't know it was the same E. I love the Eels now.I dig the Eels. I love this new album. I was lucky enough to find it used since it hasn't been released domestically yet. It rocks out a lot more than his past albums. It's not as ""nice"" as they were. It hits you with a punch and makes you stand up and say, ""F... Yeah!!!!""Buy this album, You'll dig it, too."
2,K Rothe,"Updating isn't Leil Lowndes at her best. Its filled with very obvious ""tips"" and ideas. Some chapters are helpful, but a lot of it is out of date (even though the book is brand new!) or very nearsighted. An example is when the author refers to landing a ""rich"" mate, she only seems to write about the qualities ""old money"" seek. The chapter on confidence is good. Some people may find Updating helpful, but unfortunately, I didn't."
3,UpDating: How to Date Out of Your League,"Author of How To Make Anyone Fall in Love with You, Leil Lowndes, writes this book in an informative style. She repeats many ideas from the first book. While there are a few things to learn from this book, I was looking for more depth."
5,Comfortable and roomy,"These jackets are just awesome. I bought three different colors. They are durable, comfortable, and warm. I took them into the field on some of the colder days in Washington DC. They survived and kept me warm. Plus they just look good.Get a couple. You won't be disappointed."
5,It Happened in Boston?,"I just finished reading the new Modern Library edition of ""It Happened in Boston?"", which I had first read 35 years ago. It still seems as startling as it was then; all these strange characters, and the mad protagonist. What a feat of imagination! I had actually expected it to feel somewhat dated but it didn't - quite the contrary, it seemed completely of the moment. I think this edition should find a new audience, among readers who did not exist when it was first published."
2,A sloppily written book,"The content should be accessible to any graduate student but the sloppy writing style has made it unnecessarily difficult to read. Out of the many poorly written places, here is an example. In section 6.3.5 on page 248, it wrote, ""Recall from section 9.3.1..."" But I am only in chapter 6, how can I recall something from chapter 9. I then checked chapter 9 and found out that the forward reference was not a typo.""Foundations of Multithreaded, Parallel, and Distributed Programming"" by Gregory Andrews is a much better written book. Unfortunately, Gregory's book does not cover the same content."
3,Art of Napping Pleasant Book,This is an enjoyable little book that gives good reasons for napping. Not as informative on the actual physiological issues concerning napping.
1,Toy Story Woody Costume,"I bought this costume in a 3T/4T for my son's 3rd birthday and it just barely fit him. He would outgrow this in no time. I will give the fact that he is a bit tall for his age, but he is also a string bean. I would go the next size up."
3,"Super Pet Small Animal Gravity Bin Feeder with Bracket, Colors Vary",Although I could find it here it didn't prove to be as sturdedly made as I would have liked. Used to feed our rabbits
2,guinea pig feeder,"I thought this was a feeder you could put food in for a weekend when we would be gone. but it does not have an attachment for the cage so the animal can knock it over easily. the food spills out and he can access all the food at the same time. He is a pig, what do you think, of course he eats it all at once. it does nothing more than if you over filled the bowl in his cage before you went away for a couple days"
3,If god is political he/she can be any color desired,"More politics than spiritual. Also a bit dated, course that probably cause the book was written during a different time. Still, things haven't really changed much. So a good read - over a few sittings."
4,Pretty Good Workout,"This is a pretty good cardio workout. If you have a minimal amount of time, this gets the job done and gets your heart rate up. I am more bias towards the 1st workout which is a straight cardio workout as opposed to the second with floor work.I love Billy's encouraging words, it helps move along the workout. Do this for about a month or so if your a regular exerciser than progress to the advance, which is going to be my ultimate workout goal."
1,Disappointing,"The second half of this disc has some moments but the ""In the UK"" portion is quite terrible. I feel sorry I spent good money on this one!"
3,John Stamos a hit,"My wife loves John Stamos and he was really good in this movie, even though the movie was not quite as hot (if you get my meaning) as one might think from the title. Lots of sexy situations and thought-provoking for a long-term married couple, but marginal nudity and heat."
1,Buyer Beware! Bottle Volume is Not Listed!,The shipping weight is given but not the bottle volume. It is critical to know if this is the 3.5 ounce bottle as this item also comes in a tiny sample size. This appears to be the sample size rather than the full-sized 3.5 ounce bottle sold in stores but it is unclear from the description.
4,Solid album,"This is a solid album from The Used. I recommend it to any one who likes rock, punk rock, and screamo."
5,"Lively, Intelligent Treatise on Bees","I found this book by chance and what a delight it is. This guy can really write! I have read many books about bees and beekeeping and this is one of the best--he brings the bees to life and clearly explains bee behavior, anatomy, etc. in vivid, entertaining prose. His observations are wide-ranging and generous. Highly recommended!"
4,bfi does a good thing,"these little books are very helpful for deepening the understanding of a favorite film.they are well written, not too boring and perfect for a day of travelling by air or train because they're not bulky. they slip right inside a computer case; then you pop a dvd in of the film you've read about and you're set!total edutainment!"
1,This is horrible,I wish I could rate this as 0 stars. Giving it a 1 is being too kind. I think the description provided under the product details does not accurately reflect what you see in this film.
4,Great DVD From Ruthless Records,"although multi-platninum artist's Bone Thugs -N- Harmony have been released from Ruthless Records (owned by Eazy E[RIP]former wife Tomica) This DVD does show old good times that bone thugs have had Bizzy Layzie Krayzie Wish and Flesh. The dvd has nothing to do with bone (as in editing producing ect..) I think ruthless had made a great dvd , the clips are abit unbalanced because most clips are imported by fans across the world. Bizzy deliver's a stunning performance as long as lay and wish , though krayzie is abit quite while performing (if u have checked out there last video's u can tell his a quite person) Although there isn't much of flesh-n-bone (hes on the stage with them at times) but they never showed clips of him doing his thing like the other bone memebers. I will have to give this DVD a 4 , better quality would diffenitly get a 5."
5,Funny Funny Stuff!!!,"Well if your offended easily, I would suggest buying something else. Otherwise this cd is great. It is a duet style cd, where Celph Titled, teams up with J-Zone, and if you know anything about either artist, then you know what to expect, if not then your in for a surprise. J-Zones raps are typical, and usually are based on sex, well not much different here, but he adds a twist that makes his songs hilarious, and he doesn't take himself to serious. Celph Titled is the punch-line, funny tough guy, blow stuff up kinda guy, which isn't exactly different than most other rappers, but he makes it very entertaining with a sense of humor, and punchlines that fit like a glove. Anyway if you want club songs, with catchy beats, then look elsewhere. If you want lot's of humor, punch-lines, great refined beats, and rap that's just plain straight forward with a take no-nonsense approach, then this is for you. Recommended as a must buy in my opinion."
4,2 of my favorite rap comedians,"Fun album, not 5 stars but a great listen, lots of funny punchlines. These 2 guys are just goofy and crack me up, I cant wait for some new stuff from Celph 1990now was so sick and he improved so much."
1,Nascar Heat (Playstation),"After a long wait I just purchased the Playstation addition of ""Heat"". I'd start by saying that the addition of the alternative playing options was a good idea and a great addition to any race game, specifically ""Beat the Heat"" and ""Race the Pro"". But that's the only thing good about this game.... And my 6-year-old daughter mastered those in the first day. The graphics are about 3 years behind other race simulation games on the market and the sounds at best perform in ""Mono"" they are hollow and distant and quite honestly sound like are a...recording attempted at some race track. I was very disappointed.... At best I consider this a Beta piece of software, as exampled by the Lap counters and there failure to properly count Laps and maintain consistent position of the users car (If you get a Lap down you will see what I mean)."
2,BURN YOUR OWN FROM A REEL TO REEL OR SEALED LP,"Still WAAAAYYY Too Much HISS on this Remastered CD..Just not as much as on the Original 2 CD Columbia Release or the Subsequent 1 Cd Release on Columbia or Chicago Records.You would be better off buying an Original Reel To Reel or Find a Sealed LP on EBAY or music Store and Burning it yourself. These other ""Raters"" must be ""Homers"" and say anything is great that gets put out on their band. As A Chicago Fan since 1970 I was Highly anticipating this ""Cleaned"" up Release and Was Thoroughly Disappointed. Even the Japanese CHICAGO 2 CD is Horrific."
1,Chicago II--Major Disappointment II,"Ditto my review of Chicago Transit Authority.""Colour My World"" and ""25 Or 6 to 4"" are the only two cuts on this CD that aren't painful to listen to. Well, OK, maybe ""Where Do We Go From Here"" as well.Thankfully, Chicago found where to go--as far away from this material as possible!"
3,Older book,"The book came in great condition, pretty sure its brand new. However, it was published in 1999. One of the first points it makes, on the first page, is to always use current material when teaching in the classroom. So, I feel weird continuing to use it's information, but the information it does contain is wonderful. It is a great book and the reviews do it justice. Just know, that it is old material."
2,"No, it isn't so great","Other reviewers are quite right -- this is sub-par noir. Although one wouldn't want it to linger much further beyond 72 minutes, the character development and plot resolution do seem rushed. In fact, quite a bit of the acting and interacting seems to be ritualistic, like the players are aware that they're making a noir picture, so that they must strike a certain stance or pose in keeping with the genre. Self-conscious noir doesn't work.I will say that the scenes in the vault itself are pretty tense. The final scenes in the bowling alley are just lame and ill-conceived.And again, everything gets sewn up in a tidy little package at the end - gangsters knock off other gangsters and get caught by the police. How convenient!Skip it. Certainly don't buy it."
4,Cute poster,"Beautiful poster. True to size, and the colors are vintage which is what I wanted. Shipping charges are too high."
3,Not as good as others,"I purchased two yo-yos at the same time in order to compare functionality. This one and the ""Duncan Pulse Yo-Yo"".This one ""sleeps"" so well that we find it difficult to get it to return.This one is difficult to wind (even after twisting the string). This is related to the string being very loose.This one is very wide and does not fit well in the hand.This one is fairly heavy and causes finger pain after a few minutes of trying to get it to work.The Duncan Pulse Yo-Yo is wonderful in comparison. It has none of these flaws, is easy to do tricks with and was a bit less expensive, also.Three stars might be a bit generous, but it is a durable design and should be around to cause frustration for years to come."
4,replacement parts seem fine,I bought this when my shaver's original foil wore to the point that it was nicking my face. This seems a fine replacement part for the original. No complaints.
3,Functional,"I have used this model of foil for years. It works. It doesn't work great, but then again, I never get a decent shave (given my skin type)."
5,"Encompasses all conditions for improving your ""net worth"".","So China, Russia, and other countries seem to be hurting. Read Getting Rich in America and see how a change in other economies will increase sales and import/exports. Americans who take advantage with saving now will reap the returns latter. You too will be financially secure. Simple savings will pay off big time."
2,Not impressed,"I felt that the characters in this book whined too much. It seems very melodramatic with no sense of humor. I also found the characters not very true to human behavior. In fact, all but one woman (and she was helpless) in this book was a total be-atch. The plot was very transparent and predictable. The best part of this novel was that it took place in Washington, D.C. and I knew of all the places he wrote about. After I finish this review, I will never think about this book again."
3,A Week In The Woods,"Is this one of Andrew Clements best....no. However, it is an interesting idea for the main character to learn how to camp and survive in the ""wild."" And once we get to that point in the book, it grabs your attention and holds you to the very end. However, having to wade through the first part of the book is a challenge."
2,It felt like a month in the woods!,"This drawn out tale has only one or two interesting chapters, and they are near the end. I can hardly believe I stayed with it that long. We get way too much background on the major characters, especially the teacher. (...)"
4,A Week in the Woods,"Mark Chelmsley had just moved to New Hampshire, where he would have to attend Hardy Elementary. At the school, A Week in the Woods was a beloved tradition and Mr. Maxwell was in charge. On the trip, Mark almost got suspended and wondered off into the woods. Will Mark and Mr. Maxwell be able to work together to save each other's lives?A Week in the Woods is full of twists and turns. If you are looking for an adventure packed novel, than this book is for you. Also, children from 9 to 13 should probably read this fantastic story. I definitely liked the sections of the book that made me feel as if I could not stop reading! A Week in the Woods is an incredible novel that everybody should read!"
5,Good book,This is an amazing book greatly written. About a boy going on a school field trip. 5 stars all the way!!!!!!!!
1,sloooooow,"Dear Readers, If you are planning to read this book forget it! A week in the woods is such a slooooow book--they don't even get to the woods until the end of the book! Try Frindle instead."
2,A Week in the Woods,"Dear Reader,Don't get this book. It is very slow. I couldn't make it past the first 4 chapters it was so bad. The first chapter is so dull I think I almost fell asleep, literally. The second and third was horrible, describes how some rich snooty kid is moving and on how his 'Dad' wants to toughen him up. You can tell what will happen after the first pages. The snooty rich kid is going to run off into the woods during ""A Week in the Woods"" alright.I would try Frindle or The Janiter's Boy, both by Andrew Clements those are good.Good job on Frindle and The Janiter's Boy, Mr. Clements!"
3,DVD version of earlier released video,"This is simply a DVD version of a video released some years ago (aprox. 5-8 years ago?) so the newer partnerships mentioned in some of the reviews above, and already released on other DVDs (and copyrighted by their producers) would not have been available for inclusion. However, what is included are several exemplary pas de deux danced by some of the best dancers of the last 30+ years. If you haven't seen them live, this is a good chance to view them at their best, and be able to compare to other (more current) interpretations and see how changing forms and style have impacted ballet."
4,Very nice visually.,"I am in no way an expert on ballet, but enjoy watching performances for the beauty and grace of the dancers as well as the humorous portions of some. This is a collection of excerpts from several ballets and is delightful in and of itself. I bought the DVD because Baryshnikov is the male lead on one track of ""Don Quixote"". Enjoyable viewing."
3,I expected more...,"It is hard to explain why, but I was disappointed with this DVD. For some reason, every time I want to watch a ballet performance, I choose one of my other ballet DVDs (such as Kirov celebrated Nijinsky, or Kirov Classics)."
3,Takes me back to college,"Very pleasantly surprised to find this CD available for purchase. I remember hearing Primitive Love Rites exactly once on my local college radio station. I subsequently bought the 45 single, recorded it to tape, and forgot about it for 20 years. Since I am an incurable list-maker, I re-discovered this song recently when looking through a list of various music and in an idle moment I looked it up on Amazon. Hey, for less than 10 bucks you can't go wrong."
2,very cursory summary with good first hand accounts,This is a very basic and cursory overview of the black experience during the civil war. It reads like it was Mr. McPherson's master's thesis. The highlight is the excellent use of first hand accounts by both free and enslaved blacks. A good introduction to the topic but incomplete.
2,"Cute design, bu tlow quality.","This was not a bargain price for a quality item, as I'd hoped. Cute design, but more like plastic than metal. The loop holding the lower heart was open upon arrival, and upon trying to close it, the loop broke off. Too bad, as the photo is cute."
3,So expensive... for what?,"Feel and learns are very expensive and I have yet to find out why. My son has no problem peeing in these. He does not seem to ""feel"" anything and does not have any urge to be changed. We went with a cheaper brand this time and they work exactly the same.. so what am I paying for besides the Pampers name?"
4,Searching to Find the One,"This album is a reminder of the 70's & 80's up-tempo ballads that made everybody try to dance and get a little exercise. The vocals and the instrumentals are done really well. The songs Searching to Find the One, Private Party, and No One Can Love Me stand out, and compare to the likes of musice done by Earth, Wind, and Fire."
4,Love their music,"I love their music. It took me way back. Back into time. i was pleased with the CD. Wish they would have kept the original edits in the CD, and added the remixes of all the songs, instead of just the remixes, but that is nit picking."
5,HI-NRG with a Twist of LIME...,"This Cd is a great collection of Limes classic HI-NRG dance tracks.All Remixed to perfection,remember the 80s then this is the Cd for you.A must have Cd for anyone into HI-NRG."
3,no problem,No problem at all.Arrived on time. No damage.The content of the book is notthat interesting.
1,Dyslexia isn't mysterious anymore- & this isn't good science,"Dr. Levinson does many readers, especially parents of children who struggle to read (have dyslexia) a disservice with his theories. Dyslexia is a reading disorder,not a mystery and people who waste time and money pursuing unlikely solutions to reading problems have been led astray.Specialized instrution is the answer- not magic ear treatments! This kind of quackery is unethical!"
4,Gun Vault,"Excellent quality but finicky. The buttons must be pushed carefully and in a deliberate manner to activate which can be a problem when in a hurry. Therefore, a lot of practice is recommended."
4,all-in-one office equipment - this is the way to go,"It's amazing that a UPS crew can drop, kick, tumble, fumble and crush the box and yet when I peeled away the tattered outer packaging the Brother MFC-845cw came out unscathed. I've used it for a month and love it. I don't do a lot of copying or faxing but this machine is great and I'm really glad to have it when I need it. I can finally do color enlargements - my favorite feature. I discovered it by reading a review in WIRED magazine. They said it was the only one they'd seen with a cordless phone - - duh, why don't they all have that? Anyway, I highly recommend it. I got free shipping, paid no sales tax, and got it for $25 less than MSRP. Score!"
5,Very Nice WiFi Printer!,"My year old Brother MFC-845cw is a very nice WiFi Color Photo Inkjet Flatbed All-in-One Printer\Fax that just happens to also have a 5.8GHz Cordless Handset for around $230 If you're looking for an answering machine, buy another product, this just happens to be a WiFi Printer/Fax that happens to also have an acceptable phone and answering machine!"
1,THIS CD IS GARBAGE,"I was a big fan of Janet but somebody tell me what the hell this is. This album is a complete and total dissapointment. It's the same remanufactured R&B music iver and over again. This album is a lot like the 1993 Janet except this album lacks the soul and talent that was put into it. The title track, Would You Mind, and Love Scene are among the worst songs I have ever heard by anyone. The fake orgasmic sounds in WYM sound more like she is straining while on the toilet. A complete dissapointment. I'm not impressed. After 15 years of amazing music she decided put out such musical vomit, man, this is one person who has now given up on Janet. She has lost a fan. My new favorite female singer is now Bjork.Goodbye Janet, hello Bjork."
5,Awesome!!,"This book is powerful and helpful. Inside, I found so many things I didn't know, not just about organization, but about dressing well, also. It makes me want to get busy and get things straightened out so I can find outfits at a glance. I especially appreciated the shopping tips that help you focus on what you need to complete any outfits in your closet. I highly recommend this book to anyone."
3,"Picture shows red, it was tan.","Really wanted the red which was shown in the picture. No where does it say the color is different. The kitties love it no matter what color, but I would have prefered to know it was not going to be the color shown."
5,Scholar in Training,This is a great book for someone who is seriously interested in biblical literature and more specifically the exile period in the Hebrew Bible. I love this book because its an academic read that isn't written in so lofty a manner that you can't grasp what is going on. I recommend this book to those interested in the academic side of faith.
5,Great Poker Set,CaraThis was a gift for my husband who plays in a weekly poker game. He was really excited about the dealer buttons. A perfect gift for a poker player.
2,Breakout,"If you're looking for a great ball-bouncing brick-breaking game for the PC then look somewhere else. The graphics are pretty but the controls are horrible. Add to that a game that will only take you about 2 hours to go through and you have a major disappointment.HOWEVER, if you ARE looking for a great ball-bouncing brick-breaking game for the PC (that's similar to the classic arcade game Arkanoid) then go download the shareware game DX-Ball. Or better yet, DX-Ball 2!Whatever you do, stay away from this game because the controls are guarenteed to frustrate everyone who plays it."
2,Hmm...Not so sure on this one.,"I am a huge Sondheim fan. Don't get me wrong, but this is not what you think of when you think of Sondheim.The performers are fine. The musicians are fine. But ""Frogs"" is an amateurish, uninspired, and uninteresting piece of theater. Maybe it's just because I'm just listening to it on disc, but on this CD, it's not good. ""Hymnos:Evoe"" was a good song though, I must say, if only for the ""Evoe...Alalai Alalai"" section, which stuck in my head for days.The reason I give this even two stars is that the songs from ""Evening Primrose"" are decent and got me going at the end of the CD and that there are some moments in ""The Frogs"" that shine.If you're a Sondheim fan, I highly suggest you go with ""Into the Woods,"" ""Company,"" or ""Follies,"" which happen to be my favorites. The new recording of ""Into the Woods"" is especially enjoyable with Vanessa Williams as the Witch, as is the original recording with Bernadette Peters."
4,Unknown Sports Hero,"This is the autobiography of Glenn Burke, a black, openly gay major league baseball player in the 1970's. It was written while he was living with his sister and dying from AIDS. It is a short book but very interesting. He certainly loved the game of baseball and it was a trajedy that he didn't have a better career. His describes being gay in the major league and how his friendship with Tommy Lasorda's gay son helped to shorten his time with the Dodgers. He also discusses his descent into drug addiction. His name should be more well known than it is, and I hope someday a good movie is made about him to help him get the recognition he deserves."
5,Johnny Is Tops,"TTB is an awesome musical about the life of Johnny Larson as he was writing Rent. It was introduced to me by my friend Kristi who is a hardcore Rent fan. She said she got the album and will be seeing it for her birthday when it comes to Philly. With her approval I knew it had to be good. So, I got a copy myself and loved it. It has the same rock feel as Rent and I highly reccomend!"
2,Tick...tick...dud,"It's just not that good, people. Calm down. Far too derivitive -- all these songs sound like things I've heard elsewhere. Some of them, of course, I have. Larson mimics Sondheim's ""Sunday in the Park with George"" and even the theme song from ""The Jeffersons."" BO-ring. Here are some lyrics: ""I feel bad / that you feeling bad / about me feeling bad / about you feeling bad..."" Gee, isn't that witty and clever? It's like, it goes around and then comes back and stuff. Like that.Here's my version:It's time that people in SoHo / Realize that people outside SoHo / Aren't that interested in SoHo / As are people in SoHo.Save your money."
4,The Big Man's Walker,"This rolling walker is great! My father-in-law is on O2, 24/7. He has COPD and can get winded easily if he is exerting himself on his walks. He's a big guy: 6'2"", 260lbs and this walker is up anything he can dish out. The handles are just right for his height at the highest setting, the seat is nice and wide but it is also a little higher than a chair so he can get up from a seated position easily. The basket is large enough to hold his oxygen tank. The brakes work great, push down on the lower grip to lock the rear wheels or squeeze them like bicycle handbrake levers for fine brake control. The only drawback may be that it doesn't fold quite small enough for a full-sized car trunk; the handles need to be removed for it to fit."
2,The reviews are as dubious as the research,"As I write this, there are seven reviews of Leamer's book on the site. Six of them are positive, and five of those are from the Washington-area. What a surprise that Mr. Leamer lives in Washington! These reviews give every impression of being written by friends of his--especially the one by Dan Moldea, who's an author himself.I've read the book, and it reads like a compilation of tabloid stories and interviews with dubious sources, trying to milk every last cent out of the Kennedy franchise. That's bad enough. It's even worse that Leamer's using reviews of dubious authenticity to sell this crud."
4,Funnily enough...,"while I like this I don't LOVE it. Someone To Watch Over Me is fabulous. But I think she was saving up the best for My name Is Barbra, Two... I know it's just subjective. The voice is just as wonderful, I guess i just prefer the material n Two.."
2,Not as sturdy as it looks.,"I bought two of these on Feb 15th 2011 for my new ferret kits. It was fine for a while, but as the male started to grow, he would stand in the water bowl and it would flip off of it's brackets under his weight. I ended up super-gluing the brackets to the bowl, which was a good fix for a couple more weeks.. eventually the plastic snapped beyond repair, and I had to toss the water bowl, and swap to a wide-mouth water bottle.The food bowl, however, is still alive and working well, four months later(after getting the super-glue treatment). So, I suppose it depends on what animal you have and how hard they are on the bowls."
3,food bowl,When it says something about lock I expected it to lock onto the cage so they couldn't get it off. But they can and they knock it all the way to the bottom well today I went to put it on and it broke on me so it was a good buy but I wouldn't buy something like this again.
1,Pathetically stupid,"Don't waste your money on this deeply unhelpful book, unless you're trying to build a library of ""everything-you-do-is-wrong""- style parenting books."
1,There should be laws against this parenting style.,"The authors suggestions, such as not going to your baby when he cries, are outright appalling. I urge potential buyers of this book to skip it and purchase something by William and Martha Sears, or at least something a bit less Neandertal..oh, wait, even the Neandertals probably comforted their crying babies! Henner fails to produce any evidence supporting her method, which if followed will almost certainly produce a withdrawn, angry child."
1,Is this book a parody?,"I honestly thought after reading the first couple of chapters that this book was a parody. It reminded me of some skit ""Saturday Night Live"" would do on parenting. The answers were short in words and substance. There were also a lot of contradictory statements. The book made me question the credentials of Dr. Sharon. If Marilu and Dr. Sharon felt they HAD to collaborate on a book, then perhaps the better approach would have been for Marilu to pen a book on her views of succesful acting, with Dr. Sharon offering asides to THAT topic."
1,Annoying,"This book is so irritating and annoying. Marilu Henner comes across as bitter, and not enjoying her children very much at all. She is so concerned about being strict with rules that she seems to miss the joys of parenting.I wonder if she has changed her mind about any of her statements now that her children are older."
4,Good but buggy,Frogger one was a big hit. It was a very basic game that caught on. Frogger 2 has some very big advanges to frogger 1. First they have a plot and story line unlike the first one. They have serval difrent frogs to choose from although I do not see that big of an advange to any diffrent frog. The arcade mode has a little advange but not a big one. The bottome line though is this game is a little buggy. For example in the options menu you can not see where your cursor is. It is a sold game with some upgrades needed.
2,not as good as the first,"Frogger 2 has much better graphics then the first frogger, however, it lacks the challenge of the first game. it took me 2 years to fully beat frogger and 2 days to beat frogger 2.Even though this game is fun and the graphics are well developed, the game itself has less substance then its processer."
5,Not realy for Sleepytime,"This is a great CD, but it has not helped put our son to sleep. It is much better for quiet time. I do highly recommend it."
5,"Wow! An obvious cousin to ""Gone, Just Like a Train""","For those who like to hear Bill Frisell step out in the trio format, this record is for you. Ably backed by jazz legends Dave Holland and Elvin Jones, Frisell skims some of the best songs from his recent work and re-arranges them into the jazz trio. As with his earlier masterpiece ""Gone, Just Like a Train,"" the trio format allows Frisell to step out of the ensemble and carry the melody. Toward that end, he uses more sustain, and his solo voice is well-heard. This record is full of energy, off-kilter yet memorable tunes, and innovation. Bravo, Bill."
4,"Enticing, easy-going alt-Jazz","Another eccentrically languid offering from this great guitarist with an excellent supporting cast provides ample counterpoint to a majority of sunny-side Jazz-guitar output. Touching around a multitude of styles, Frisell and company usually add a darkened, though certainly not negative connotation to what in lesser hands would have reeked of bland retreads (case in point: the often abused and exploited cover of Moon River totally works). Between imaginative covers, impressionistic homages to traditional forms, and heavier, more personal experimentation, this may be as good a crash course as any for beginners into this eclectic, prolific, singular artist. It is not his greatest- a few dead spots here and there crop up amidst reliable interplay, and the sampler feel touching on many different styles may alienate certain specific fan expectations, but in an attempt to be all things to all people of the mildly experimental jazz guitar form, the disc is a bridge-builder."
4,Moss Out Works ok,The product works ok. You really have to soak the area heavily for it to have any effect. The iron leaves marks on decorative stone. (I found this out the hard way) It really needs a 2nd coat to work well.
1,Not even close,"Incompetent, very poorly edited, and a lot of empty space to make the book seem more than it is, which is... barely there."
2,"Dull, Plodding, 78 minutes I will not get back","I know several people loved this movie, based on the reviews I see here now. I'm here to tell you it is NOT for everyone.A guy and his wife travel to the home of his ex-friend - her ex-lover - for the weekend. Their marriage is troubled. She is tempted by her ex, he is tempted by the ex's new fling, a silly-acting married woman who likes to run around naked.You see lots of dream sequences with water and several scenes around the lake. The symbolism is tired and nothing new. He's drowning in his wife, his obsession, his lack of confidence... The list goes on and on.I can do foreign films that are engaging, but this one was just too much for me. It is dull, the film is green throughout, and it was excruciating at times to watch. Perhaps a bottle (or ten) of red wine would have made it better."
5,"what do you expect, its smith and wesson","typical great quality from smith and wesson. the blade is sharp, and it attached through the handle for extra durability. not cheaply made. the knife is a bit on the heavier side but i like that since it means for extra power when in use. i bought one for hunting and hiking and it can easily penetrate flesh of deer, as well as to fend off other animals during hiking in an emergency. includes a sheath and sharpening stone."
5,Very nice,I bought this for my son for christmas and it is very nice. The case is great to keep all the chips in order
3,"A taste, but not a feast","Tired of amulet bags? This book does not contain a single one. Instead there are needle-cases,a necklace depicting elephants, and teeny-tiny cups and loaves of bread. Maybe a bit precious, but certainly not run-off-the-mill. But a word to all authors and editors of beadwork: Photographs (and, similarly, scans) of size 11 beads printed at 100% are too small for a beader to understand what's going on. And when the beads and thread are both dark, it's futile to try to understand the thread path. If you want a book for inspiration, this one is nice. If you want a book for instruction, go to one of the lovely books that has clear diagrams, Carol Wilcox Wells's books, for example."
2,Way beyond beginner,"This book is your standard seed bead how-to fare. First you learn the stitches, followed by projects using the stitches. The trouble with this book is that the projects are far beyond beginner level. If you are just starting out with seed beads, their size alone is daunting, so look for a book with easier projects."
1,Pike was a theosophist,"Pike was actually charge with the responsiblity of rewriting the 4-33 degree by the Soveriegn commander of the rite. In reading Pike's work I can see how people think that Freemasonry is evil.He entered a lot of pagan or occult theosophy into the degrees. It is and interesting read but I only read the interesting parts and leave the Occult parts alone. For example early rits of the Knight of the sun degree was biblical, but pike changed the characters to deities such as Bel and Mithra. For a more pure read of A.A.S.R read the Francken Manuscript. I gave a 1 rating because Pike is not my favorite person."
2,couldn't get into it,I'm sure there are plenty of people who would love this book - i just couldn't get into it :(
2,Disappointed,"After reading this book and comparing it to Dr. Arem's book The Thyroid Solution and another book for Graves Disease called Graves Disease; A Practical Handbook; I found this book to be lacking in how it was presented, ease in understanding and resourcefullness."
4,Not bad at all....,"Personally I like the cutesie drawing style and the basic story line. The first book didn't really interest me all that much but I feel that things picked up alot starting from the second book onward.As for the whole ""faerie"", ""avalon"", no make sense thing, it's the fault of the translators. The faeries aren't supposed to be part of ""avalon"" (I have no idea why they associated these two together, they most definetly are not from ""avalon"" in the original), they're figures from old korean ""mythology."" In fact, I'm not even sure you could call them ""faeries"" exactly. *sigh* thats what you get from some of these translators."
3,it's ok,"Overall it's a decent, cute story (granted i've only read three volumes so far) Boy gets life overthrown by supernatural girl; we've seen this plot before. the manga, er mangwha? has it's moments. some of the artwork is sloppy but some panels are very well done making it worth it to at least look at it. the story is sometimes jumbled and hard to follow and at certain points it drags. it gets more interesting as it goes along though. i like the characters, i like the humor and will continue reading it, however i wouldn't recommend spending your money on it. go to the library like me and just check them to enjoy."
4,Trusting the reviews,"Well, I am definately a Tesla fan and it doesn't get any better than the 5 man acoustical jam. But I'm going to have to trust everyone when they say this is a good cd. I say this because I saw Tesla live at the Boathouse in VA Beach and it kills me to say it but they sucked live. 3 other bands in the boathouse kicked @SS so I know it's not the location. BUT!!! I will take a true fans word and pick this up."
2,Not suitable for the beginner,"Mr. Schiller has a PhD, but his book does not reflect much quality control went into its composition. There are missing figures, but yet referenced in the text. The book lacks an index. Several words are abbreviated, but there is no apparent explanation for them. I get the feeling this book went from first draft directly to publication. The hefty price is not justified. I am glad I only borrowed it from a library. The one purpose of the book seems to be to promote Excel spreadsheets he has created to track the OEX; and their prices are equally inflated. Why must you, Mr. Schiller, sell them from Spain? Isn't trading the OEX sufficiently profitable by itself?"
5,Excellent,"Graph are incredible, and the game is friendly user.Great response, seems like you are playing with real players on the field"
1,Doesn't work,"Game came on a single DVD, installed without a hitch, and would not play at all on either of my less than 1 year old computers.I keep getting ""wrong disc inserted"" or ""no disc inserted"" messages when trying to start the game from either the start menu, desktop shortcut or autoplay window. A tech support representative from Konami e-mailed me an elaborate list of things to try, thinking that its some kind of conflict with some of my other software but I haven't gotten around to trying any of it yet...It's too bad because I heard a lot of good things about the game and was eager to try it. Should have bought the PS2 version I guess."
2,Serling has written much better books...,how seriously can you take a book when feirce political rivals allow eachother grandstanding monolouges for not paragraphs but PAGES on end. the endless monolouges even interupt time critical action sequences. I have read everything Sterling has ever published as well as most of his cyberpunk contempararys' work. This book falls well short of his usual high mark. It was not the subject or the characters... the delivery was abysmal. I feel bad that one of my favorite authors would fall down like this. cyberpunk authors seem to be dropping like flies. even the great Gibson's latest published work is about his love of watch collecting on e-bay. Thank god we still have Stephenson churning out great science fiction.
3,not the best,"This was my first Sterling novel... I can't figure out those who say that this ranks up there with Stephenson's Cryptonomicon. Not even close. I did particularly enjoy Sterling's dissection of federal funding of science in the late 20th century and his projection of one possible future scenario. Being deeply involved in the frustrating, absurd and increasingly meaningless quest for public funding for science, I really appreciated this portion of the novel. Unfortunately, the whole didn't live up to that particular part. It was sometimes funny, but in the end was too disjointed and unfocused. I was glad when I finished it."
1,Disappointing and sketchy,"I'd expected more from Sterling. Distraction could have been a much better book, if the author had decided what exactly it was supposed to be about. Instead the book jumps from subject to subject, never spending enough time on any of them to convince, and none of the characters are well-enough drawn to make you care about them. Sure, Distraction is full of interesting ideas, but none of them are immediately, intuitively convincing, and because they're skipped over so rapidly, they just aren't supported. I've always found science-fiction to be most interesting when it deals with the results of scientific discovery or societal change, so Distraction should have been a bargain, since it includes about twenty times as many changes as most or SF novels. Instead, its very unsatisfying, because instead of exploring the effects of one idea, Sterling throws another one at you. I remain unconvinced."
1,GRAND PRIX 3 = WORST PEICE OF CRUD EVER,"GP3 is HORRIBLE.Bad graphics,bad sound,bad idea to buy it.GP3 is so bad it made me miss Night Driver for Atari 2600.Back to Grand Prix Legends for me,if only I could go ten laps without my engine blowing up!"
1,Worthless piece of garbage (a more apt term couldn't be used,"Infogrames, Hasbro Interactive, and Geoff Crammond have a lot of guts to put out such [junk] as this. I own several other racing games of all sorts and this is by far the poorest. The calibration is poorly defined, I was never sure what I'm supposed to do. I've got a $[money] racing wheel that can't be calibrated-don't tell me this game was designed for a joystick!!! To make it even worse, technical is non-existant, and I mean non-existant. I challenge anyone associated with this game to contact me to explain how to calibrate this because I would really like to give it a fair shake, but as it is now, I wish I would have used the $[money] bill that I spent on it to have wiped my nose (once again a more apt term couldn't be used); at least I would have gotten some utility from my money. And Amazon should be ashamed to offer something like this for sale."
3,"Good, but not Great...","The Grand Prix sim world is still in need of a top-notch racing-sim. I've never actually driven a real GP car of any era. But if GP3's physics modeling is remotely accurate, the modern Grand Prix cars are just marvelously high-tech slot-cars, guided around the track by marvelously high-priced chauffeurs. I like GP3 better than F1 2000, but with today's advancements, a Grand Prix sim should be available which flaunts the graphics of NASCAR Heat, along with a physics model on the level of, say, the venerable GPL. For some reason, we're not there yet and GP3, although entertaining for a week or so, is not in this league on either category. GP3 is certainly fun and I pull it up every now and again just to listen to the Euro-music, but when I'm in-practice, GP3 looses to GPL every evening. It does have one advantage that many of today's power-hog sims don't; you can still run this quite nicely on a 450PII and a cheap 3DFx card."
3,Many better formula one games out there,"I just recently had a chance to try this game out, and it wasn't that impressive. The graphics are ok, but i've played a lot of other formula one games with much better graphics, gameplay and features. I wouldn't buy this, its not really worth it."
2,More like an informercial for her other book,"Loved the concept, but it was more like an infomercial for her other book. It never gets to the meet of things."
3,Needing more organization,"I picked up this book because it looked interesting at a used book store. I was pleased, but also let down. While I like the things that Anne is approaching, I do not like the way she approaches them. I find her book hard to follow, it jumps all over the place, and spends too much time on ""fluff"" I feel like she rambled on for 200 pages, and the other pages were where the actual information and revelations lied.While I wouldn't recommend this book if you really want to read something enlightening, it is a nice little eye opener. Better used as a reference, or something to skim, because reading all the fluff really takes too long. I got to the end and wondered what I just read."
2,weak lens,"Length:: 0:36 MinsHandle these glasses very carefully-if you stress them in the center they will crack, and you will have to buy and install a new lens...more money, they would know the weakness when they made them. I would stay away from the purchase, as nice as they are there are better glasses."
3,temporary replacement,this charger has broken in several places and is not a good replacement for the standard charger.
4,Great mix of innovative music with an older sound,"A very refreshing blend of modern rock and an older new-wave style sound. Funny lyrics and a quirky lead singer add to the sound and create a really fun and interesting album. I would recommend this to fans of early punk music and early new wave like Devo and the Talking Heads, as well as anyone else who is dissatisfied with most of the music being released today."
3,Very debut-y,"Ima Robot's debut album is filled with a handful of good songs, and some embarassments that fail miserably. For the most part, the sound IS original, falling somewhere between The Undertones, Missing Persons, and Pulp. It's a hit-and-miss affair, but the good songs sure are catchy, and I their follow-up to this may just be incredible."
4,excellent and a half,"Long before Rod Stewart sold out with disco singles like ""Do You Think I'm Sexy,"" in fact long before disco at all, he was making fantastic British Rock with first the Jeff Beck Group, than the Faces, which he hooked up with as they grew from being the Small Faces.You probably won't recognize any of this wonderfully organic, blues based rock. But the organ, biting guitar, and fantastic bass work made this music some of the most genuine and sincere rock and roll of the very early 1970s. If Serpent Power and the Doors and Lothar And The Hand People were the dark tunnels of 3am early FM radio in America, the Faces were the daylight, for the daytime. Too ambitious for Top 40 AM.I came to this not knowing any of this music and that is a great advantage. With ""classic rock"" being great music that has been played out, it is wonderful to know there is still that which flaked off as free form FM became playlisted AOR.It is there to be discovered all over again. Start here."
4,Faces find Ron and Rod,"Small Faces (Faces) / First Step: This is the first album that Small Faces (who would soon change their name to simply, ""Faces"") had finished with Ron Wood and Rod Stewart in the lineup. Their version of Bob Dylan's ""Wicked Messenger"" is amazing. The rest of the album is good, but never rises above the first cut. A nice four-star release."
3,"ordered 4; 3 are ok, but stitching came out of the end of one","I already own 3 of these from another company, and I like the way they work, but I needed more. I ordered 4 last month, and used them for only a week when (after a heavy storm), a lot of the stuffing came out of one of them when I picked it up. I guess the stitching on the end of it was defective. If I'd known, I would have reinforced the stitching or something, but oh well. A big mess. I am returning the defective one, and will reinforce the stitching on the other three as soon as they dry out."
1,Bored to Sleep,"Teaching middle school age students I am surprised there is solittle to offer in reading about King Arthur and the Knights of theRound Table. Any writer should know by now that to interest a child,or any reader for that matter, dialogue must be foremost on a writer'smind. This book was boring, offered little conflict and almost nodialogue. What do writers think children are reading now a days? Andhow can one even hope to begin to spark a young mind's interest in ourliterary history if this is what is set before them to learn from?Don't bother reading this, unless you need to fall asleep, quick."
4,A GOOD INTRODUCTION TO A CLASSIC,"I am currently reading this book, and it is very good. I read the reviews on many other editions of the Arthurian legends, as well as some of the reviews on this one. I was looking for an edition that was faithful to the original sources, yet accessible and enjoyable to read. I would say that this is a good modern edition for the general reader. I would recommend it. I subsequently ordered the hardbound edition of this book.It is beautiful, well-made and well-designed. I would also recommend this edition. As a final note, It would be helpful if the book descriptions and reviews all matched the book being sold. Sometimes they don't, and it can be confusing. I don't remember having this problem with this particular book, but I noticed it when trying to get information and reviews on some of the others."
4,Luke is Great,"Worthly effort. This album is average for Luke Vibert's usual albums. ""Prick Tat"" and ""Gwithian"" are the best two tracks. For starters to Luke Vibert, I recommend his 2007 ""Detroit, Chicago, and Redruth"" album."
4,Good Intermediate Level Video,"This is one of the first exercise videos I bought, it was combined with Ultimate Stomach and Thighs (don't bother with that one). It really got me hooked on Kathy and she is one of my favorite instructors. The aerobics in this tape are really fun. They are broken down into several segments with different flavors. The 50's Dance and the Hawaiian were my favorite. Beware though, this workout is very long. I broke down the segments and only did a couple when I did this tape, you may not want to do it all at once, especially if you are a beginner. But this workout is fun."
1,Please do not spending money purchasing this DVD,I read the reviews about how cheesy the workout is and sadly did not listen. I could not believe how cheesy the movements are. And aerobic intructors do not use these movements today. It is definitely 80's everything. Don't be fooled into buying this dvd. If you are looking for a great workout please buy one of her newer dvd. Such as the timesaver one or two or rules of fat burning.
4,Not her best video,"Although this is very dated it does elevate the heart rate and make you sweat. I consider myself to be at the intermediate level and I can go through the entire routine. I am not particularly fond of using weights while doing the aerobics because I like to focus on one or the other. The workout is fun especially the last section which is more dance oriented. I really prefer her step workouts which, for me, seem to work the legs a lot more. Although this is not my favorite it still gives me a fair workout."
5,Always one of my favorites!,"I first bought this on VHS in about 1990. I really love it. I always have and even now that I am getting back into shape and am nearly 20 years older, it's still a challenging video.I like that the video actually works out almost all parts of the body while dancing on your feet.If you don't like it because of the music, sets, costumes, you need a) accept it for what it is and b) look at the exercise value.I find it entertaining and nostalgic. I will admit, I am a child of the 1980s and still love the music. I never had mall hair, though."
1,The Worst!,"I'm so dissapointed in this video! It talks about how beneficial, working with weights AND aerobics are TOGETHER, however, there may be a whole 5 minutes of using weights! Some cross training! Very outdated, some parts are just ""silly"", I think I'll stick to ""The Firm"" tapes, they haven't dissapointed me yet!"
2,A little dissappointed,Normally I love Kathy Smith Videos -- but I found this one hard to follow and a little to high impact for me. I much prefer Funtionally Fit and Fat Burners low-impact aerobics to burn fat.
1,very outdated,"I read the other reviews and decided to buy this workout. Definitely not a good choice. It is very very outdated. The costumes, music and choreography is all very ""80's"" like and is very distracting and annoying. Try something more modern by kathy, like the kickboxing workout."
3,Where's Bryan White?,"The first time I heard the song without Bryan White's vocals, I realized how annoying it was to hear only Shania's voice on a song was meant to be a duet, for the entire song. Bring back Bryan White! (or at least get the full-length CD for the true ""duet"" version)"
5,SHANIA DOES IT AGAIN!!!,"From This Moment On was released as a pop single in the late summer as a solo track. Shania does sound beautiful in her solo rendition, however I feel that the duet with Bryan White which is available on the Come On Over full-length album does this song much more justice. Either version is a great love song, probably the new difinitive wedding song. -Derrick Guynn Director Of Operations: Powerhouse DJ Entertainment; Speedway, IN"
4,Efficient,"Weights aren't my favorite activity, but I need to do them and this work out is over before I know it every time. It is easily executed in your home--no jumping around shaking cabinets, no broad swath of space to clear to move around, no step apparatus. A piano bench makes a fine substitution for the gym version, or a chair works well, too. Unless you are familiar with Kathy Smith's communication style, you may be lost the first time around, trying to figure out which weights to use when--her cues tend to fly by. The simultaneous two track work out is a bit confusing at first, too. A word to beginners who don't possess a lot of upper body strength: start with 2, 3 and 5 pound weights, and take it easy with those 5's. And don't worry if you don't make it through the first time. You will eventually."
5,2 sessions and I'm hooked!,"This is a great workout. Not only do you lift weights but you have to balance while doing it, it strengthens the 'core'. I love the design your own workout feature. Kathy's a great instructor she always shows how to do proper form and variations of the moves. Just when I'm about to swear at the TV it's over. I've only done two sessions but I'm hooked. I'm trying the stability ball workout tonight it looks fun and challenging."
5,Entertaining,"I am planning to purchase this video but I had to read the reviews before I do. I am giving the customer reviews 5 stars. Clearly this video is both well loved and equally hated. I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. I found the negative reviews hilarious! Thanks for the laughs, and now to place my order."
5,First time I've gotten good results from a weight video!,"I love this video for several reasons. First and foremost, it is fast. I appreciate that it is broken down into sections (upper, lower, abs/back) because I can't always do the entire tape. Second, it gives me options as I progress. This isn't a tape I'll just be done with after a few months. Third, I love Kathy and she has helped me like no other instructor has to achieve results and maintain them. I've lost 12 pounds in less than 2 months and I feel fantastic! I like her style and her attitude and I would recommend this video for people who have already done some weight training. I believe there is no warm-up on this tape because of the *timesaver* element. She wants you to get 20 minutes of weight work in and I have no problem warming up and stretching a bit for 10 minutes on my own."
5,Great workout!,"I really enjoy this video. You should complete the whole video: upper body, lower body and abs, in order to really get a good workout. You will really work your whole body."
3,3 stars just because Kathy is annoying,"I've never bought a Kathy Smith tape before, and I have to say this will be my last. The workout itself wasn't too bad, the 2 tracks were great. Having a choice as to how hard you want to workout with weights is nice. It was Kathy's whoo-hoos and 'encouraging words' that spoiled the workout for me. I do understand that lots of folks do workout better with encouragement, but I think there's a fine line between encouraging and annoying. I will keep doing this tape, simply because I paid for it, but will try and do it on mute!"
3,Kathy Smith,"This is a good, quick workout for upper/lower body, but my big criticism on it is that there is no warm up. When I want to do Kathy's workout, I use the warmup on my Karen Voight workouts and then switch over to Kathy. I'm not sure why she couldn't have put a quick warm up in this program. Other than that, the three programs (upper, lower and abs) are intensely targeted workouts for days when you can't fit in the longer program of other workouts."
3,Good 20-Minute Workouts,"I bought the 2-pack that includes LWTLW 2 but haven't gotten to that one yet. Personally, since I'm not a beginner I like not having to listen to a long instruction preceding each exercise, and I think they are good quick workouts. I use my own iPod now that I know the routines and just watch, so I can listen to my own music.I know this may seem trivial but when I insert the DVD into my computer, on my screen the title reads 'LIFT WEIGHTS TO LOOSE WEIGHT."" If I had a dollar for every time I saw it spelled that way by posters on the Weight Watchers boards..arghh."
2,"KATHY SMITH: CHOPPY, LOUD AND TERRIBLE!!","I agree with June 26 review....except I am going to say it better...her instruction---SUCKS!Most irritating is the fact that she yells!...I don't find that particuliarly motivating. In fact--""I FIND IT QUITE DISTRACTING"" (Can you hear me now!!?)And the moving all over the 'friggin' place as she is lifting---is also DISTRACTING and nerve racking to say the least.I was never a fan of hers anyway but I needed a routine (and still do now) for a free weights program.This...definitely (4 me that is...) isn't it.If I didn't mind paying shipping and handling again...I send it back to the seller (bless his/her ole' heart...they got it to me sooo fast)...with no expectation of a refund.That's right...they could have this s%$!& back fuh' free!!!"
4,Good Blade,"I'm very satisfied with this cross cut blade. It does everything I need from it. It rips fairly well if you don't cut stock too thick. Sometimes I forget and rip wood too thick. If I do this too much it seems to collect resin buildup on the sides and will cause burning if done too much. I have only myself to blame when this happens.This resin will clean off quite easily with many household cleaners. Simply spray it on generously and let it sit for 5-10 minutes. Brush the blade with a plastic brush and it comes off easily. I sometimes need to do this a second time, only if I've ignored and allowed this resin buildup to become quite excessive. Again, my fault.The special expensive caustic cleaners don't work any better for me and are a waste of money as far as I'm concerned."
1,no certificate for this expensive watch.,Nothing can prove it is real or fake. just make me don't feel confortable at all. And the seller won't give u any words either.
5,great lighting fixture,"this is an excellent fixture, not too difficult to install, very nice product."
1,Avoid. Appears to be pirated.,I love the game and wanted to get a new all-in-one copy of the gold version of the game. This is however appears to be a pirated copy with an invalid key. (Search UBISOFT + WGYTF...J847Y and you'll see the complaints.) The clamshell cover and inside key are obviously printed by a high-end laser printer and the DVD itself appears to be produced in a copier. Avoid and get a better (valid) version.
1,Not fun,This game is impossible. Why bother making it if it's impossible. One unit of a certain type could easily wipe oot a whole frickin' army of another! OCH!!!!!!
1,Wish i could tell you how much fun i had...,"i purchased this game with birthday money and searched for one that WASN'T a ""Ubisoft Exclusive"" i was sent a blue box, Ubisoft Exclusive. the picture was wrong and when i went to install it, froze my computer 3 times and the other 2 times it told me the disk was empty. i am disappointed and out 16 dollars."
5,travel man-purse,Been looking for something small enough not to be a problem yet big enough to handle my travel wallet and a few essentials. This does the trick and is an incredible value.
2,Cheesy,"I was hoping for something that showed at least a little quality, and this doesn't do it. I'm havingback problems and can't sit on a wallet in my hip pocket so was looking for a decently made ""manbag"" to solve the problem. This product carries what I need but looks seriously tacky."
3,The size,"Very nice, good looking, elegant, manly, light, just wonderful.... If only it was .5"" wider, .5"" taller, if only the pockets had .25"" more in width - I'd pay double price for it. The size of the bag feels suffocating to me. One pocket for glasses (I assume) and one for a pen/pencil - they are made in such a way that glasses ALMOST fit, and a pen can be SQUEEZED in but barely so. I like carrying books in my bags - with this one I can manage to squeeze one thin book in it and with enough effort I can even zip it up with the book inside - but barely. It's like everything has to be SQUASHED/squeeeeeeezed with this bag. One half of an inch more everywhere - and I would have given this beauty 10 stars.As for the smell mentioned so many times in other reviews - mine had a smell of healthy leather, pleasant and not offensive at all. Smell is almost gone (unfortunately... )"
5,Great bag,"this bag more than met my expectations. It is well made and just the right size. It was a gift for my husband and he is extremely pleased with it for carrying writing materials, cell phone, meds, etc."
5,Funny extras for a classic film,"I don't know what that other reviewer is talking about. The sound quality on my DVD was just fine. I hadn't seen the film in years and was pleasantly surprised at how well it holds up. Some of the extras have some sound glitches (the Dave Schools interview goes on too long but the first 15 minutes are great and the director/producer commentary has sound drop outs at the beginning) but the film itself looks great and sounds fine.As for the extras - the commentary track is hilarious and the B-52's video is a great addition. As far as the clips from an unfinished Flat Duo Jets film - well, I just hope they finish it because it looks like a masterpiece in the making.If you liked the original or just want to find out about underground music in the 80's you really need to get this DVD."
3,Pretty Basic,"The book is well-written. However, I found it pretty basic if one has been studying spiritual energy. I have been a long time fan of Caroline Myss' work. She recommended this book and thus I thought I would read it. I feel that after studying Caroline's work, this book was at a beginning level of exploring spiritual energy and its impact on your biology. However, if one has not been exposed to much of this information and is looking for a place to start, this book is excellent for that person and that purpose. It is clearly written and will move a person new to this area forward in understanding and working with their own energy and power."
3,Positive Energy CDs.,The ideas presented by Dr. Orloff are good. The presentation is a bit rushed for me. I would have liked more time to absorb or try out her suggestions.
4,Intuitive Empaths,"The message of Positive Energy is to be mindful and from mindfulness comes a new kind of freedom, both in knowing one's self fully and in being fully present in one's life.Dr. Orloff offers great information about how to deal with life's issues. Where she's especially strong is as an empath and it's as an empath that her voice is most authentic."
5,Highly recommended for all Empaths,Anyone who struggles with 'unexplained' fatigue may find this book helpful. Wonderful insight on situations in life that may be draining energy without our realization.
3,Fizzled,"In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Kiyoki (the son of a great mask carver) forsakes his family history, duty, and lover for his painting, which he pursues in Paris. There's powerful stuff here about family betrayals and about art consuming one's life. I felt so much promise with the story, and yet it seemed to lack closure at the end of the novel. The family estrangements are (rightfully) unresolved, but I was expecting a different ending. Also, I noticed too many editorial errors which I found distracting."
5,My opinion,I appreciate the shorter segments that you can build upon. This DVD is very easy to use with detailed instructions on how to add segments as you become more toned. It also makes it easier to fit into busy schedules.
5,Great step workout for everyone,"Wow! I love this DVD. I did step years ago through gym classes so I've seen a lot of different instructors and workouts. This is actually one of the best. The instructor cues well and is not annoying. You can get a very good workout and the moves are not complicated at all. The DVD lets you pick the segments you want to do so you really can customize your workout. The abs and lower body workouts are short (less than 5 minutes, it feels like at least) but that's all I really want, so they are perfect for me. I highly recommend this to beginners and advanced steppers alike."
3,"Decent Workout for Beginners, but Annoying Host","As a beginner, this tape was quite effective and a great introduction to Step-Aerobics, but now that I have been doing step aerobics for over a year at the gym and using other tapes, I find this tape very boring and too easy. I find myself adding ""power"" moves to the moves Kathy is doing to make it more challenging, even during the advance portion.Speaking of Kathy, she seems very uncomfortable in front of the camera and it is almost as if someone off camera is telling her and her crew to look like they're having fun. It doesn't seem real. Especially with her half-embarassed forced sounding ""Uh-huh's"" peppered throughout the tape...and how about Richard's mullet and sweaty hanes t-shirt...ew!That's all, if you don't mind the awkward fake enthusiasm, you will have an effective beginner's workout.Good luck!"
5,"Excellent for both beginners and advanced ""steppers""","This has to be one of the best step videos, and best Kathy Smith videos, I've used. I first purchased the tape approximately 5 years ago and it is still used once a week in my 5 day routine. The general concensus on Kathy is either you love her (solid, basic choreography) or hate her (miscued videos, too ""cheery""); this is one even for those who fall into the latter category. The moves are fairly basic, yet remain challenging. Her direction is pretty good on this one. If you want to try step but feel it may be intimedating, try this one. If you have been doing step for awhile, you will be pleasantly surprised that it still can be challenging."
3,step workout,"This is just an ok workout. I had been doing step workouts in the past and this one wasn't very good, I got bored with it. Kathy gets winded and out of breath in it and you have to pay attention to what she says because sometimes she makes mistakes in what shes saying and trys to correct herself. Whats nice is you can select levels of the workout you don't have to do the whole thing. It might be ok for a beginner."
3,Nice workout.......,"Kathy brings you from very beginner to an intermediate (not advanced) workout. It takes a bit to get throught the beginner part but I like to do longer workouts so I run through all of the levels. It's a good ""time to start stepping again"" dvd when I have not done step in a while."
2,One Wheel in the Sand,"I'm an avid step-aerobic exerciser and consider myself knowledgable and informed when it comes to this subject. I was excited to view this video after having read the comments about it on Amazon.com. Much to my dissappointment, it was not all that I had hoped it would be. I suspect that I may be a little particular when it comes to working out. This video is well over 50 minutes long, broken into segments designed to cater to individual workout levels, and never seemed to get started. The music is terrible and reminds me of some new age chanting...hardly motivation to get pumped up. The only redeeming quality is that the sculpting portion at the end of the video is pretty effective. I do not recommend this video to spunky people who are serious about their workout ""working them out""!!"
3,Decent Basic Step Workout,"I have been doing this workout for many years and it's one of my old standbys, so I got it on DVD after the VHS wore out. I like it because it gives a good workout and the steps are not too complicated to follow, but varied enough to keep me interested. The only problem I have with it is that the cool down section does not really feel like a cool down at the beginning; it's more of a lower body squat workout and so is irritatingly mislabeled."
3,Fun for what it's worth...,"For mindless entertainment, this book fits the bill. Entertaining, but by no means a work of art, I recommend getting it from the library or waiting for paperback. Better than Nathan's Run."
4,The most Peaceful CD I've ever heard.,"This CD is for those who want to escape from whatever their going through. This CD takes you to another place. CeCe's vocals are so smooth. I loved the way I felt after listening to the album. My only little problem is that some of the songs are too peaceful, maybe it's just me, but the end of the CD where the upbeat songs come up, whew! I was ready. Great Cd."
5,Great for the Soul,This is a great CD. If you are looking for music to enter into GODs presence this is a good worship CD. To GOD be the Glory!
5,Uplifting Worship,Once in a while a CD comes along where you can feel the artist dig deep within him or herself and let the spirit of God lead and use them. This is such a CD. CeCe brings forth some powerful worship songs that cause one to pause and meditate on the one above. And isn't that what it's all about anyway? This is a great CD and I highly recommend it!
5,Wonderful... Amazing!!!,Her music is so beautiful... I can feel deeply the relationship of God through her music. Also Her DVD is great!!! I can't forget her powerful voice and passion to the Lord. She is best!!!
5,WOW!!! HER BEST YET,Ive been playing this cd over and over..its simply fantastic...a total praise and worship cd. This is her best by far. Each song will have you praising God. I recommend it highly to anyone who is a Cece fan and or a praise and worshipper
4,Excellent for those looking for the basics.,"I picked up this book on a whim, since I speak Turkish and wanted to learn Azerbaijani. I was pleasantly surprised to find not only words and phrases, but introductions to the alphabet, fairly thorough grammar, and loads of useful and very usable words and phrases. Awde is a great linguist, as well, I have picked up several excellent books by him on many subjects an find his work to be very reliable. I highly recommend this book."
3,Azeri language guide,Is a brief guide to the language of Azerbaijani which I will make use of but wonder if there isn't a good CD set that allows me to hear the language.
5,GREAT SERVICE,"this book was hightly recommended, can't wait to read. This book came very quckily, would reorder from this company again"
2,Expected more,"I was disappointed by this book. He makes the same general points over and over with very little concrete steps to help people struggling with being ""crazy busy."" In the middle Hallowell shows off cutesy words he's coined to describe this phenomenon."
3,INGLORIOUS BASTARDS,"I enjoyed this film, but it was not as exciting as the new version by Quentin Tarantino. Actor Christopher Waltz stole the picture."
2,misled,I ordered this item off of Amazon as a Christmas present for my son who is a Quentin Tarantino fan And I wAs misled by the cAptions written on the description of the movie I assumed that it was the latest release of inglorious bastards The movie is The original from 1978 Not what he was interested in I paid for guaranteed shipping before Christmas almost 8 dollars I'm did not receive the movie until 1-4-2013! so I will never order from this website again and pay for extra guaranteed shipping! I feel that I was misled by the review of the movie And Also Paid a lot of money for guaranteed shipping before christmas! ThaT was never delivered before ChrisTmas So very diSappointed Thank you Donna Rasmussen
4,Better than the remake!,"I have both movies; this original one and the recent remake by Terantino. This one is much better as far as story line goes and as a WWII war movie. Sure the actors are not as well known; Bo Svenson is no Brad Pitt, but when I watch a movie, it is also about the story, and not just the actors. I had no problems with the DVDs all two of them played perfectly. So here it is short and to the point: remakes are seldom better than the originals!"
1,Low quality,The discs do not work in any of my players They seem to over sized disks and do not work
2,cute shoe but elastic was too stretchy,The shoes are really cute and would probably work for a child who is 4 or 5 but for anyone smaller the elastic strap just doesn't hold the foot in the shoe like it should...the shoe would be far better with a buckle or a velcro closure...the elastic was just too stretchy and my daughter's foot would slip out making the shoe unwearable and in my opinion even a little dangerous.
5,Amazon Reviewed Purchase,"I work in a hospital and we use a lot of alcohol hand rubs which play havock with my nails. This gives me a way to protect my nails without the shine. The vendor price was excellent, the delivery time on target. Will definitely use and recommend this vendor again."
3,Maybe I'm too old.,"Hillsong is always great. Good worship music. I personally find there is too much repetition in the songs, but that may just be my age. For those who love contemporary worship music this is a good one."
5,One of the best electronic records of the decade?,"Yes, yes it is. I came back from a Snares show last night, seeing Aaron Funk improvise was mind-blowing enough. Here he has put incredible effort into this work (not that his live stuff doesn't!) Word of mouth has told me that heart and soul was put into this disc by Winnipeg hearsay, and I totally believe it. Shocking that the music press hasn't gotten all over it already, it's a beautiful record, the dramatic orchestral bits with the breakcore beats make it a fascinating (and for Snares vets) a surprising listen, to keep it simple, you'd never expect to hear these two incredibly different styles of music put together, but it is the incredible differences that make this album work. This record definitely cements Funk into absolute importance in electronic music's history. I hope that's a decent review, it's late!"
5,beyond awesome game!!!,"I have the gamecube in the household. and my brother wanted tales of symphonia for christmas and told me i would like it. i got my mom to get at target for $20 for christmas. i wasn't too interested but decided to play since it is partly mine. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES YOU WILL EVER PLAY!!!!!!!!! i recently replayed for the 4th time and ended up staying up to 3:30 am, which i don't do. i love the battle system, and the story line is amazing. and i love the music. one of the best rpgs i have ever played"
5,"THANK GOD, A GOOD RPG FOR GAMECUBE","Simply put this game puts all other Gamecube RPGs to shame. If you have a Gamecube and like RPGs at all, buy this, there's no reason you shouldn't. The battle system is great and even better if you have 1-3 friends playing with you too. There's a pretty good story to go along with the action too. If you buy any RPG for Gamecube, this is the one you WILL buy."
1,tales of symphonia,"This game is bad. the game play is horrible, and you cant figure out how to activate co-op mode. If you plan on buying this game, DON'T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is not worth your time and money. Get a game like phantasy star online.Now, that, is a good rpg. tales is rated T for teen. Also, look into the game series of Zelda, by Nintendo."
5,wonderful wonderful wonderful,"This by far is the best experience I have had so far with books that I buy. The customer service went above and beyond my expectations. The book is in perfect condition. Sometimes you don't know what to expect. I got a note sent along with the book. That doesn't usually happen. It was a nice surprise. I hope to do more ordering and i suggest to everybody that if they want to buy from very honest, nice, and courteous people to buy from here. Thanks for the great experience. Michelle"
5,The Dangerous Year,"This is a story about a family of baby skunks who had to survive their 1st year without the guidance of their mother, who was killed by an automobile while trying to save one of her babies. It is a compassionate and true-to-life story about a species that one will truly learn to love and appreciate after reading the book. The author obviously understood animals' multitude of challenges faced living in the wild, in particular the skunks. I read this story each year to my 3rd grade students, and it was always one of the favorites. Such a wonderful story should never go out of print, but I understand this book is fairly difficult to find now. I will never let go of my copy!"
3,Last book in a good series,"I loved the first three books (trilogy, if you must) in the series, fourth and fifth were pretty good, the two prequel books (of which this is the second) were OK. Good solid writing but missing the spark of the first three.If you like good action-based Space Opera with a bit of mysticism thrown in start withThe Price of the Stars: Book One of Mageworlds"
4,Be prepared to concentrate,"This movie has so many twists that you will need to watch it more than once. The vocabulary of street thugs is impressive. Proof that there's more to our language than the F word. Only heard one or two 4 letter words even though this movie deals with drugs and the violence that is caused by them. The language is somewhat Shakespearean and at times hard to follow. Great movie for teenagers, many lessons to learn here."
1,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"This movie has a great cast, a seemingly good story, and a ton of eye candy, but even with all that it has going for it. It was just weird. I didn't understand the code, the slang, or the point. I was looking forward to this one and I was incredibly disappointing. This is just one strange movie that you can avoid."
4,Not your Basic Detective Novel Flick....,"This is my First 'Review' - Didn't know anything about ""Brick & was drawn to it by Joseph Gordon/Levitt - The only other 'big name' is Richard Roundtree in an almost cameo, but Nora Zehetner was a pleasant surprise for me - My test for a 'good' movie is whether it can NOT put me to sleep - The ""Brick"" kept me on edge all the way through - Was surprised to find myself watching a 'teenage' detective movie - made almost like a class project - would be interested in the actual expenditure on this - but drawn in & kept wondering ""where is this going?"" - The acting was adequate - don't see any Oscars here, but an entertaining & fulfilling flick for a Saturday afternoon - The 'repro' on my DVD was good, with NO problems & well handled by the Studio(s) - A Keeper for any collection of films. JFJ"
2,Bang bang chitty chitty bang bang...,Ah - film noir - ah - high school drama - a twist on an old classic made modern by muttering teens - and who better to flick an eyebrow - faces twisted in angst - dialogue so dilaberately convoluted that it becomes very clear that each character is just spouting their lines - but no one is actually listening or waiting for what the other has to say - because not even they understand it - how tongue in cheek. How dull.
1,Pretentious Film School Stuff,"You're expected to believe that a bunch of high school students are capable of running an elaborate drug dealing cartel, all the while never appearing to ever go to class. The plot is muddled and the dialogue is slow and dull. It takes a long time to begin to make sense, trying the patience of any viewer. Adults don't seem to exist in this world. And the exposition at the end by the two main characters is so complicated and absurd that it exposes how weak the script is by having them recite and explain to the viewer what just took place over 90 minutes."
1,TARGET PRACTICE,"THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN. IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY SOME OVERLY COOL HIGH SCHOOL PUNKS. I JUST WANTED TO FAST FORWARD TO THE LAST 5 MINUTES TO SEE WHAT THE MOVIE ENDED UP BEING ABOUT. A FRIEND AND ME ARE GOING TO TAKE IT OUT SKEET SHOOTING OR MAYBE DRAG IT BEHIND THE CAR FOR ABOUT 10 MILES UNTIL IT IS COMPLETELY DESTROYED. IF YOU ARE AN OVERLY COOL ULTRA GEEK, YOU'LL LOVE IT. IF YOU ARE AN ADULT , DON'T BUY IT....HELL, DON'T EVEN RENT IT....PITYFUL"
1,smell toxic,"These have a horrible, toxic plastic smell to them. I threw them out, it was too much work to return them."
3,good resource,A good resource for those seeking to know God and who He is and a good reminder for believers to regain their perspective of who God is. I am a believer with a personal relationship with God. I don't agree with some of the doctrines presented in this book(being of the Reformed church) but the meat and potatoes of Christianity is here. The small differences doesn't determine our salvation. I can unite with other Christians and the church by keeping in mind what are the notions vs. what are the landmarks. When you re-establish the basics of who God is and all His attributes you can continue to grow in your faith with what is most important....to Trust and Obey. We can't do it by trying to be the one in control and living life on our own power. This book puts the focus back on where that true power and control is. With God!
4,Believe me - THIS BOOK WILL MOVE YOU!,"I grew up and still live in a rural area but didn't work on a farm. But you could have lived in NYC all your life and still identify with some of these stories. A very raw and real book. I swear when I was reading some of what these guys said, I almost dropped the book because it was EXACTLY what I have fealt and gone through. I wish the author would write another book like this. If you have always thought of yourself as on the outside of gay culture, then you will identify with the experiences documented in the book. Couldn't put it down."
5,Does the job,I had been using a 5 port but came up needing one more. This device served the purpose at reasonable cost. And it arrived quickly.
3,"""Reason Enough"" to buy","I'm not generally a big bluegrass fan, and I just happened to hear ""Reason Enough"" (the first track on the album) while flipping through the digital music channels. I immediately came online and bought the CD.Perhaps because I'm not a huge bluegrass fan, a lot of the songs on this CD are not to my taste, but, appropriately enough, ""Reason Enough"" is reason enough to buy the CD. It's a beautiful song, and Dale's voice matches it perfectly. It also perfectly sums up the situation if you've just suffered a break-up. It's one of those gems that you find where you least expect them, and it's not-to-be-missed."
2,Non-Intuitive development flow and glaring errors,"Good book overall. However, the development flow was non-intuitive. The complete game source is not included in the bookand the downloaded game code is a different version thanwhat's in the book. Also, the book has a lot of coding errors."
5,FABULOUS PIECE OF JEWELRY,"The best way to describe this product is that I just ""love it!"". I wear it often..it is a beautiful piece of jewelry. It is well crafted and seems to hold up very well. I recommend this to anyone that is looking for a smiliar piece. I am sure you won't be disappointed."
2,Looks cheap!,"This item looked great on the computer, once it arrived it looked like it came from a gum ball dispenser. Very flimsy, and thin. The design is beautiful, but the quality is not there."
2,Interesting but Needs a Better Organization,"I really like this book, but wish it had an included index for looking up names with a specific rating on one of the scales in the book. There is a name index in the back that is useful for finding a specific name and looking up the information about that name."
1,Blah,"I bordered this book and was really anticipating it having read other's reviews of it as...- a must have for club kids- less like a novel, more like a crazy night out- the kind of book you'll read in one sitting- written by a NYC DJ it describes the ultimate club, that fantasy many clubbers chaseI'm on p. 113 and finding myself skipping sentences to get through this quicker. It is awkwardly written, often improbable and there are skin crawling hints of a too-close-for-comfort kind of ""close"" family. I'm yet to read anything about the club as I'm trudging through the three main characters unremarkable childhood. The ony thing keeping me going is the promise of the novel but the book seems so different from how it was reviewed that I had to research it again to be sure I didn't accidentally buy another novel of the same title.I hate not finishing a book so will try my best to keep reading but really feel this is a waste of my time and money."
4,Fabulous soundtrack- and Faith Evans is wonderful,"What a great soundtrack! It's like a mini-Beyonce album (like Whitney Houston's ""Bodyguard"" soundtrack), featuring the additional talents of the wonderful Angie Stone, the reunited Destiny's Child, Ann Nesby, the O'Jay's and my personal favorite, the heavenly FAITH EVANS, who sings a wonderful version of the Donna Summer classic ""Heaven Knows,"" and proves that Ms. Evans needs to sing more uptempo songs. I can't wait until your next album, FAITH!!!"
1,Terrible for pets.,Slips all over tub and hair gets caught and won't rinse off. Thought it would stay with the suction cups.
1,something changed,"We play outside in wind and need a heavy birdie. Last year I bought these at half the price and they were great. This year I paid more and they changed something. The rubber tip is different and they don't work as well. Also, there is some white glue to hold the tip on and after a few hits, the tip separates and flies off. You can push it back on, but if you hit it a certain way, it comes off again. You spend your time chasing the rubber tip around the field. Very disappointing product. that's the problem with Chinese products - you never know the quality."
5,Great debut album from a solid rock band,"I saw V Shape Mind when they opened for Evanescence at Summerfest in Milwaukee. I loved them immediately, and couldn't wait for the CD to come out. It may not be the most unique album in the world, but its a solid rock album, and there isn't a song on the album that I don't like, which for me, is quite rare. I've been listening to it constantly, and I'm liking it more and more everyday. Vocalist Brad Hursch has a very unique voice, and is probably the best part of the band. This CD is definately worth buying."
2,Worst album Ive bought so Far this year.,"ok this Band could be really good If they changed 1 thing.This one thing they should change is the Singer.Hes got a terribly Annoying voice.Alot of people were telling me that I should buy this album...so I did.The only song I was able to listen to was ""Monster"".I Didnt even know that was in rotaion on radio until someone told me.But the other songs on the album are really bad.Unless you like the way Mudvaynes singer sounds when he tries to sing,dont buy this cd.And thats Not opinion...thats Truth.ANyone who tells you they sound like TOOL (Which is what I was told by several People)Needs to go out and Buy A Tool cd and compare the 2.They sound nothing Like Tool.They Sound like an Even Worse Version of Trust Company."
4,The best first-person WWII game I've played,"Excellent graphics, even better sound. The sound effects immediately impressed me.. reminded me of ""Saving Private Ryan"". Almost too realistic at times.Has a few shortcomings, but overall it's a very good game."
2,Tastes Terrible,I don't know if this product works well. It seemed like a good idea to have an antacid with a pain reliever but I could not take more than a few sips. It tastes disgusting.
2,"Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire","I don't recommend this book. The author presents himself as a liar. He lied to his wife, he lied to his kids, he lied to his employers, he lied to his insurance company..... Throughout the book he lied more than even a TV sitcom character lies! The only person he didn't admit lying to was the reader but how is any reader going to be able to tell when the author is telling the truth."
2,slow reading,"I have read all of Liz's books and couldn't put them down.This novel, I just could not get started, very slow reading.But this was her first novel or 2nd one so she has really improved.I love her."
2,louisiana,"product was late in getting here, (due to bad weather though) was very very faded-almost black & white with crayons on it. I got my charge out of it though, I had to look at it as though I rented it, however I was hoping it would have been great so I could have kept it for othr to see. Oh well, it was an old video. Supplier was ok though, no problem with seller."
4,I like this gun,"It is very powerful and accuracy... well it is a shotgun so it is good close ranged. The pistol it comes with stinks. The shotgun lasted about a year for me and is starting to break. A secret: the more times you pump it, the more bbs come out, but it does lose power per extra bb"
1,WARNING: Do NOT purchase this junk!,"THis is an awful kluge. Compared to comparably priced competitive music compostion software, it is poorly organized, difficult to operate, and produces mediocre results. The voices are thin, cheap tinwhistle sounds. Easily outperformed by C64 software from 20 years ago. BEWARE!"
5,Consistently good,These are the only disks that record in my older DVRs. They're also the only disks that record in every DVR I've ever had without regard to manufacturer. Being a +RW they also play in every dvd player I've tried them in. It's good to know there is one brand of disks I can trust to work no matter what.
5,Great!,I'm a New Media artist and used these discs to burn DVDs for my recent gallery show. I've used maybe ten of the discs and haven't had any problems.I love using DVD+RW because I can easily rewrite the DVD or erase it and use it for another project.
2,"Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't","I bought these to use with my Panasonic DMR-EZ485V DVD recorder. Sometimes they work, but more often I get messages that they're incompatible with the recorder. This can sometimes be resolved by taking them out and putting them back in. It's been frustrating and I wouldn't buy them again. We previously used Maxell DVDs that worked fine."
4,good,so far i have really good results recording on these discs however i have bought 5 packs altogether and each pack i have used has at least 2 discs that come up not able to record on this disc
5,Sony RW Media,"Thanks, The Sony RW Media Is great, the fact that you can reuse the DVD are great. The +R or -R are unforgiving..Seller recommended!!!"
1,Endless Formatting,"Do not purchase this if you own a SonyRDR-VX500 DVD/Cassette Recorder, I just put one of them in my DVD recorder, and like all other new DVD RW discs they have to be formatted, which is no problem but this Sony DVD RW has been formatting now for over 40 minutes, I don't know if it is just the one disc, but my recorder is locked up, cant shut it down, stop the format, change channels, do anything... I have been using Memorex DVD RW's and have had no problems recording or formatting them (format takes about one minute)I assumed that being a Sony disc in a Sony recorder would be a good thing, but from this problem I will stick with Memorex DVD RW's from now on.While I was waiting I formatted one in my computer with Nero and in less than two minutes it formatted fine, so if you want them for your PC they seem to be OK.Now I am off to unplug my DVD recorder"
4,Okay so far,"Haven't tested all of the discs in this pack, but so far the ones I have used have worked well. I am using them in a Magnavox 515 HDD recorder and playing the discs back on the same unit and a Sony Blu-ray/DVD player in another room. No problems so far. I will update the review at a later date once I use more of the discs."
1,"Falls apart very easily, waste of money","I am so thankful that I only paid $2 for this when it was sale. It is pretty much worthless at carving anything except a very tiny, very thin pumpkin. The scooper works great, but so does a spoon. The carvers bent and snapped fairly quickly. I couldn't even get them into the pumpkin, even though I carved the inside down to way less than an inch thick. I had to use a knife to get started, then the saw, then a knife again, then the saw to even it out. I could have just saved my money and used a knife and spoon.The CD has some cute patterns, but they're nothing that you couldn't find elsewhere online for free. I really don't recommend wasting your money on this."
4,An Interesting Book,"The Secret of Gumbo Grove By: Eleanora E. TateI enjoyed ""The Secret of Gumbo Grove"". It shows a tourist town from an interesting point of view that made the book fresh and exciting. This book is so novel that there are no other books that compare in its genre. The writing is of a very high quality. I would recommend this book to almost anyone of any age. I would rate this book an 8 out of 10 for interesting plot and characters, but it's slightly boring. The ending in sepcific is boring. I like the location and the detailed histories of the characters must have taken forever, due to the detail in them. The plot could use a little work in the way of the antagonist, who is a bit predictable. But the other characters are pretty well created. The ending was kind of disappointing and not very exciting. But all together the book was enjoyable and easy to read. They are trying to save a cemetery from the people at their local church. I'll let you figure out the rest....."
3,Look at built in options!,"I found this in stock at our local Toys R Us (Beavercreek, OH). I suggest taking a trip and trying them out. We found this one to be hard to steer with the parent's push bar and it doesn't come with the seat belt. For the extra $ we went with the Radio Flyer version with the rear steering gear, child's seatbelt and cup holder tray. I think it was well worth the extra $20!"
3,I'm sorry folks but I found it rather boring.,"I managed to pass this Christmas season without listening to my usual many hours of beautiful Christmas music on my local FM Classical music station, so I decided to go out and buy a basic collection of classic Christmas music.Of course, no collection like this would be complete without some brass music, so I bought this CD and the ""Joy to the World: Music of Christmas"" Empire Brass CD.I got the Empire Brass CD first and I loved it. It had a traditional sound -- not too experimental or cute -- but the arrangements were lively and complex, and I could listen to it over and over again.Then I got this CD and was amazed at the difference. The musicianship is superb, but the arrangements are plodding and dull. Just blaat blaat blaat everyone-play-same-note stuff. There didn't seem to be a lot of passion in the music.It still has it's charms, however, but I think this will be one CD I listen to only once each Christmas season."
4,Gotta have it,"If you're a B. Burke fan, you just have to have this in your dvd collection, its not that great of a dvd....but its not that bad either!"
4,If you're into REAL smooth R&B...,"Gary Taylor's ""Mood of Midnight"" is the kind of album that's rarely made today. It's intensely sexy and relaxing without being overtly carnal or boring. ""Mood"" is only one of the many fine albums Mr. Taylor has made over the years, and arguably one of his best. Sample ""In Search Of"" or ""I Will Be Here"" and it will become obvious that Gary Taylor's vocals and arrangements are top notch and well-performed. Younger listners may not be enamored with this release, because it's clearly aimed at a mature audience, but almost any lover of R&B or soul will find something to like about ""The Mood of Midnight."""
2,pretty bad,"The main review tells what the movie is about, so I won't talk about that. It just wasn't that good. I'm sure a lot was lost in translation, because I watched it in korean with english subtitles. There were what appeared to be a LOT, a TON of dramatic scenes with dialogue between a couple of characters. Pretty boring. It seemed to me, that they had a few good ideas for some fight scenes, or action scenes, and then tried to write a movie that would fit. Although the fight choreography was ok, the movie just wasn't that good. At times it looked like something you'd see from the early 80's, like flash gordon, but other times some of the special effects (if you could call them that), looked like stuff only seen more recently. Don't be fooled by the ""matrix"" looking picture on the cover. 90% of the movie doesn't have any guns in it or shooting.I'm sure that most american viewers will NOT like this movie. Be wanrned."
3,"Old, but still worth hearing","It had been years since I last heard the music on this CD. Some may classify it as ""elevator music"" and to some extent it is, but it's still a treat to hear the Ray Conniff treatments of these songs."
2,This is okay...,"I guess this is an okay guitar if you're a beginner, but I would recommend a much better one around the same price range, such as the $200 to $300 Schecter Omen-6. First of all, the guitar input jack ALWAYS falls off. The loose input jack makes a very static-y noise. Also, after owning this guitar after 2 months, the tuner head for the low E string falls off so the E string is too loose to be played, and the switch does not work. Be very careful with this guitar because it's easily damaged, and it's prone to fret buzzing. The finish is nice and sound is okay, but reliablity and action aren't so great.I wouldn't recommend this guitar because after a couple months you'll need to replace it. If you look around Amazon hard enough, you can find great deals for much better guitars. I found a $1000 retail guitar for only $300."
1,Garbage,This was the worst book I ever tried to read. It is pure trash in my opinion. No further comments
1,Your typical christian un-scientific fable..,"This book is obviously not in any way connected with science and real evidence. The author even lies straight out about different matters regarding science. One has to wonder how some people can accept whatever is offered them so long as it is in agreement with what they already thought. So then why even NEED evidence if you're that dumbfounded and biased from the start..? I'll never know.The day there are evidence for gods we'll read the scientific reports in the news and see it on TV. Untill then all we can do is being amazed over how adults can still belive in fairy tales. Do you belive in Poseidon? No. You're an atheist regarding Zeus. Me too, and I just go one god further. Snap out of it already!"
4,Response to J. Brett,J. Brett:it's missing a good song from the movie and I need to know where I'd be able to find it. It's the song that Webster comes out to in the celebrity boxing match. Somebody let me know what it's called!It's called Ante Up (Robbin Hoodz Theory). It's on the You Got Served Soundtrack.
3,First Solo Flight Around the World-The story of Wiley Post,"This book is the telling of the life and adventures of Wiley Post. It is written in the style of a documentary. Black and white photographs help to tell the story as do the added maps and documents. The personality of Wiley Post, as well as his hopes, dreams, and fears are not shared with the reader. A glimpse of the times is seen and that helps to set this event in history. This is more of a book to help write a report than to enjoy reading."
4,"Gorgeous, classic pop rock","I'm not sure how Joe Pernice channeled the Zombies or Big Star, but I don't care either. The first three or four songs are sweeping guitar pop symphonies outrageous in their poppy pathos. Pernice, indeed, sounds quite a bit like the smooth, seductive Colin Bluntstone throughout these songs--a fact I never noticed during his days on Scud Mountain. The fifth song will cause Wilco to tear their hair out and hire Jeff Lynne. Though his lyrics are lachrymose and morbid, they are so admittedly (""this fascination with the moribund""), and there's a great sense of fun in that. The only missteps here are one or two ballads (Shaken Baby is one), with gross jazzy chords tipping the mood into maudlin. Pernice can write this stuff in his sleep and it bogged down his Scud Mountain stuff, too.Thom Monihan's production is stellar, crisp and full throughout: Pernice's distinct vocals swoon atop layers of guitar, piano, organ, and strings. Extremely tasty. This record was a real surprise."
5,My wish has been granted!,"Christina Aguilera has got such a great voice. One reason I love this song so much is that she adds so many riffs that each verse is totally different from each other. This song just screams ""HIT!"" and deserved all the success that it got. I am hoping that this song wins a Grammy!"
3,Old & cold tracks in a new package.,"This compilation is ok, if you like your 'hits' 2 to 3 years old. But if you want new tracks, like Britney Spears, Cher, Offspring and more, go the the 'search' field and look up ""NOW 42"""
1,WTF is wrong with Japanese brands?,"Just one word. It would 'STUCK' in the middle of your junk and won't go down. I guess Japanese people are really thin in some place. I think I'll stick with Trojan which is providing me a snug fit already. I bought this because it was cheap, but I would never buy this again."
4,Excellent sex,"These are the best condoms I've found so far. I bought 100 based on reviews here- what the heck, it was cheaper than buying a few small packs of rubbers locally and I figured I could give them away if I didn't like them.Pros- Lightly lubed. Thin! Tough- they seem like they'd last an unlubed anal session.Cons- Lightly lubed. Possibly a little snugger than average, but maybe not? Looking at posted numbers shows these to be about the same size as most other regular fit condoms."
4,"Almost ""The Very Best of...","Overall, this is a very good compilation that should satisfy most listeners. However, if they really want to hear just how diverse and talented this band was, they should have included the classic, ""Summer Madness"" It was (and still is) a mind trip of massive Jazz/Funk/and R&B proportions. Any true Funk Aficionado should hunt for this song and give it a listen.Also, Where is the disco era's ""Open Sesame"" ? The horns on this cut are ree-diculous, The nasty bass line propels this song like a freight train, and the soaring vocal harmonies are not to be missed."
5,"Disco, House, and more Disco","Rick Garcia and Mazi do a nice job of including the roots of House music in this two part mix. The mix extends for 72 minutes so you get plenty of music. The first mix by Rick Garcia is progressive house with disco mixed in. The beats boom and the sound is tight. The best way to sum up this album as a whole is that it goes by quickly. The second mix by Mazi is probably more like Disco with House mixed in. Incredibly he does it well. The beats boom, the mixing is good, the music selection is fine and fits together well. Everything in this cd goes along nicely and even though I tried to find reasons to give this cd less than five stars I wasn't succesful. If you like house music this will fit in your collection just fine. If you're not a HousERaT but still want some music to listen to and chill, this cd should still work for you."
3,Anything with Diane Franklin can't be too bad,"This movie doesn't have the best writing or production quality, but it's a cute concept and Diane Franklin does extensive (artistically done) nude scenes in the Garden of Eden sequence where she _bares_ it all (what is our educational system coming to?) as Eve."
5,"Good Plug - However, No Noticeable Fuel Mileage Increase","I have two Toyota Camrys. A 2004 SE and 2006 LE. Both have the same 4 cylinder engine. I have always been religious about checking the gas mileage on my cars at every fill up because this relays to me if anything has gone awry. The '04 had 115,000 miles and the '06 had 45,000 when I replaced the plugs. I replaced them mainly to see if it would help the fuel mileage; unfortunately for me, no difference. I'm sure they are good plugs as Bosch is well known for their high quality, however next time I will probably replace using the factory spark plugs."
2,Great Company,"I had Toyota Camry 98. I install them 4 days ago. I'm disappoint, It installed flawless as OES models, engine start as quick as OES, but the race of the engine not good at all. When I drive & push brake pedal the engine want to shut down."
3,My two cents.,"The review below clams 4.5 more MPG. A sparkplug alone will not give you 4.5 more MPG.If that was true every car would come with these plugs.Now if your plugs are completly worn out.Puting in new plugs will help alot.These plugs are fine,but for the $$$ the Denso iridium is a better plug.Right now I have not found anything better, including the e-3s.Mechanic for 40years."
1,garbage! a gimmick,complete garbage. both the dealer and my mechanic refuse to use these in my nissan xterra nor in my toyota tacoma. had to return and get single electrode NGK platinum plugs. I am pissed that i paid for my mechanic to go out and buy more plugs.
5,Words Cannot Express,"Kids, this is it. Here's your chance to broaden those horizons by a small degree. Eastern Youth is an incredible band from Japan. Of course, they've been putting out good records for years under the American radar. They released the split EP with Cursive a while ago, which was good, but simply pales in comparision with their newest album, ""What Can You See From Your Place."" While sung completely in Japanese, it doesn't matter. This record rules. The music reminds me of Jawbox. A three-piece band, the music is very guitar-oriented and all rock. Fans of good solid ""indie rock"" should invest their hard-earned dollars in this record. Check out a band called Quruli as well."
3,Not for young children,"Unless you're ready to discuss the multi-sexual status of hyenas with your 2nd grade son, I'd avoid the Lions & Hyenas DVD.If you are trying to motivate your kids or yourself to work for a conservation organization, you might find a use in the other DVDs.I'm a NatGeo baby. I loved the content from the 70s & 80s, but I'd rather watch Life or Planet Earth than this ""Wildlife Collection"" that's more focussed on the ""wild"" lives of conservationists."
1,A waste of $23.99 - Bengay Ultra Strength is better,"Ice packs and Excedrin also work better! Sadly, the analgesic gel I formerly used, alcohol-free Physio Ice, is out of production (8% menthol + 0.8% camphor). The manufacturer referred me to Biofreeze. It arrived today and the only active ingredient is 4% menthol, which Bengay Ultra Strength beats for a fraction of the price (10% menthol, 4% camphor, 30% methyl salicylate, no alcohol). The base of Biofreeze is nothing but a load of useless herbal extracts and rubbing alcohol. I certainly won't admit to my physical therapist that I was dumb enough to pay $23.99 for this junk. Injuries caused by a speeding yuppie who rear-ended me with his huge SUV. IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE EXCEDRIN OR BENGAY ULTRA STRENGTH IF YOU CANNOT TAKE ASPIRIN OR OTHER SALICYLATES."
4,biofreeze review,All in all I liked the product. It didn't work completely for me because I have r/a but I had used it before and knew what to expect. It did help some with the pain and I wanted to have some on hand Received the product in the mail very quickly.
4,it really works,good item you won't be disappointed. My sore hips got better with bio freeze.not like the over the counter sutff.
1,No Relief,"Someone at work told me to buy this product for my sore elbow. She swore by it. However, I found absolutely no relief from using it."
5,biofreeze a-one,"I love biofreeze. I run and play a lot of tennis. As soon as I feel a sore spot, I put on biofreeze and in no time I'm good to go. There is a slight smell, but not enough so everyone around you can smell you."
2,Bio Freeze Experience,I purchased Bio Freeze based on a relatives recommendation. My spouse has tremendous pain in her neck and left shoulder. Unfornately the Bio Freeze did not help ease or eliminate her pain.
3,Is this really Biofreeze product?,I bought 2 of this and got the items with no seal. Just wonder if there is really biofreeze product inside or something else.
4,It Works in Conjunction with Other Treatment,"I've used this stuff for sore muscles and aching back. My daughter uses it for her sore ankles and legs from running. You still need to use hot-cold treatment for many aches and pains, but it appears to continue the soothing after the hot-cold treatment. The plastic tube that it comes in is prone to cracking. Once cracked, it will release slowly release the menthol (the active ingredient) to render the stuff useless."
1,Rachmaninoff Undergoes Surgery,"and whiile on the table, the patient died. There is no music here. Digital sound, yes; music, no."
2,Love them....but,They are true to size. But the width is a little small. I ordered the 9.5 Wide. This is bigger than my shoe size. I bought this size so that I could wear thick socks with them. I can't. But a great shoe anyway
1,This Series Sucked!!!!!!,"This Sucked and to top it off I received the series with the wrong series title so there for I got double of this mess on different dvd's beware, this broke my heart and I love Burns and Allen and I was not even born when they were on, just fell in love with them my ten year old loves them too. Want my money back will try and send it back do not fall into the trap do not BUY!!!!! Not even worth 1 star"
2,Disappointing,"The collection is a huge disappointment for a 5 disk collection. The collection only has 8 episodes of the George and Gracie Show. The documentary would be a nice addition but with 5 disks, more episodes should be included. With only 8 episodes and the documentary, 2 disks would have been sufficient. It just is not worth your money. George and Gracie are great and were some America's finest entertainers. Gracie is the funniest woman I have ever seen, including the legendary women comedy actresses like Lucile Ball and Carol Burnett. The show is a great example of how the old Vaudeville shows were adapted to television. It is good for the younger generation to see how the commercial advertisements were built into the show. But for 5 disks with only 8 episodes is not a good value. I find it very insulting to the careers of Gracie Allen and George Burns."
3,Quality Control?,"Got the light, opened the box, put in batteries, turned it on and the blue LEDs weren't working. I was going to return it, but found 4 loose screws that were causing bad contacts. After the screws were properly secured, worked fine. Where's the quality control that should be checking these units????"
3,it's ok,"It is exactly as advertised but it is not very bright. Using it in our hot tub works ok, but if it were in a pool it would be pitiful. Why it couldn't be beefed up to be brighter I don't know."
1,Don't bother!,"The picture is VERY misleading! The light emitted from this ""starship"" doesn't even come close to what is shown. Even on the darkest of nights, you had to look very closely to see what little light there was on bottom of pool. A dud."
2,Didn't remmember,"Well between the old black and white, and the not too great old shows, it was quaint, and watchable, but not too much."
5,A great new approach from his Soundgarden days!!!,"A great song full of catchy lyrics and innovative guitar playing, it has a great edgey melancholic sound that draws you in. This will be the top album of the year!!! A nice change from Soundgarden, less heavy but more thoughtful and personal, it is his opus! Magnificent and magestic!"
5,Wonderful music,"If you like Percy Faith or music from the big band era, this is a must! Every moment of listening is delightful. Get it, a glass of wine and sit back for a restful, relaxing break."
1,Didn't work,I tried this product numerous times and it did not work for me. I did feel relaxed but it did not help me to sleep.
3,Effective,"Rescue Sleep works flawlessly in getting me to sleep on stressful nights when I can't quiet my thoughts, but for me it's had a bizarre side-effect. Every time I've taken it over the past few months, the same exact thing has happened. I have bad dreams, usually involving violence and crime, and I wake up cold. This might just be my reaction to it, but it certainly has been strange. Besides that, it helps me rest more completely, greatly facilitating the waking up process in the morning."
2,Disappointing treatment of an important subject,"I was looking forward to reading this as the subject matter is so relevant to where we are in the world today. Sadly, I was disappointed.Here's an extract from Page 588 of 604.""Truth is dead,"" Thor grumbled. ""If it wasn't for talk-show hosts like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity, America would be lost."" The Admiral walked over to Troy's TV and turned it off. If he'd had a gun, he might have shot it......Sarah agreed. ""Who would have thought that subduing the Islamic warlords was going to be easier than battling our own media. Good grief!...........""If you add some extreme anti-Islam rhetoric, seemingly well-researched, maybe valid but far too one-sided, you'll just about have the essence of the ideas expressed here.(...)A better written and plotted book might have earned 5 stars for the research alone. As it is, a 2 seems about right."
1,"If you like sexism, jingoism, and typos on every page...","...you'll love this book. If the authors' research on Islam is credible, they've blown the value of that work by surrounding their ""expose"" with characters that could be created only by bigots: a female U.S. president and Secretary of State who also happen to be cigar-smoking lesbians; a female right-wing CIA agent who also happens to be an Evangelical Christian virgin until her wedding night to an ""agnostic"" (religious right buzz word for anyone who doesn't buy their tripe) admiral she converts; etc., etc., ad nauseum. And the grammatical and spelling errors are so numerous as to be distracting, even when I really tried to stick to the story. I picked up this book in an effort to educate myself by objectively examining the authors' concepts. But their bigotry and ignorance finally got so smelly I had to put it down halfway through in favor of getting online and doing my own research."
1,"It is there,AL-QUR'AN, the muslim's guide, just read it.","Dear allI like it going so.some reviews were very useful to know what is there hidden between the covers of that book.muslim's guide is named AL-QUR'AN, it is available long time ago in English, and i think it is available now in tenths of languages (may exceed 100). are we blind or we wish to be, are we dependent or independent (at least with ourselves)???I encourage you to read the MUSLIM'S GUIDE (AL_QUR'AN) in your own language. try it and judge by yourself.Note:Have you ever read a book that challenges you to find any error or false information in it?The real challenge is there in AL_QUR'AN, go ahead, find out the trueth by yourself.It's miracles will never finish."
1,A book of some what good cartoons.,"This book was not real intoresting. It was long and drawn out. It did not get right to the point. If you want to read about cartoons and not get to the point of them, read this book. Other than that, it is not the book for you."
3,Hard to find this item for less.,"I looked all over for this item for less. Didn't find it available anywhere. Received a notice from Amazon that one was available, but it still cost me more than I wanted to spend. It looks not bad, but a little afraid to turn nobs to hard because there made of plastic."
5,Great purchase,"As someone who likes retro things, this radio appealed to me.There were more favorable reviews than unfavorable. So, I took a chance.I am very pleased with its appearance, size and the quality of sound.If you are considering this radio, I highly recommend it."
3,Good just little small,It is a okay. just it is too small and chair back is not very comfortable but overall it is good for teh price.
5,Highly Recommended Series,WindKeeper is the first book in Charlee's WindLegends Saga Series and is a wonderful and exciting dark fantasy. Conor and Liza's story is simply breathtaking and makes you wonder how one person (Conor) can go through so much pain and suffering and still go on. A definite must read!!!!!
5,Roy Rogers: Hero in Gray,"Classic action B Western with Roy playing a Confederate Officer at the outset of the Southern War for Independence who is trying to track down a murderous renegade who is fighing the war and innocent civilians for his own gain. The villain is loosely based on William Quantrill.Great Shootouts, horse chases and fun."
3,Expected much more,Short flick really. Only a few old people were interviewed. There simply wasn't enough content.
1,design flaw,The blade is backwords how can you stab like that?? This is a cheap product dont waste your time or money
3,It's ok,"it's a good knife, sturdy construction and whatnot. the blade is very dull out of the box. needs some serious sharpening before any kind of practical use"
3,Needs a proof-reader,"I read this book for pleasure as a first introduction to celestial mechanics (I am an astrohypsics major at my college), and found the selected topics coherently explained in comprehensible language. Perhaps more importantly, the mathematics (at least at the beginning) is covered more or less step-by-step - you won't get lost by any ""it is therefore obvious..."" and then a skip of five or six steps.Unfortunately - - The books is rife with typos, and nothing so simple as a misspelling. At least every other page (and often several times on one page) an equation would have an exponent or operation error (such no division sign) and references in the explanations to earlier equations were regularly mistaken.With a few more thorough proof-readings (and some more work on the second half of the book, which whizzes through a topic many times more complicated than the first half but in the same amount of time/pages), this book could easily move up to 5-stars."
5,Cool book,"I think this book is good, actually very good, but I get kinda confused with all this strange talk about Krishna and Yaksha stuff. It's really strange stuff that plays with your brain in cool ways, making you feel like you are there with the characters. From what I've heard about the other books, this one seems the best. But it was a mistake to make Joel a vampire, in my opinion. END"
4,"Gory yet beautiful, not as good as the others.","I was very happy that Sita survived the stake. Even for my tastes, I thought the book was a little too bloddy, but I still wouldn't have written it any other way. I thought that Sita pushed Joel into being a vampire too much, but I liked that she saved him from a painfull death. Everything leads up to the climax in Eddie's house very well, and the next book follows precisely how it should"
4,Love it,"Absolutely love this book, and the entire ""The Last Vampire"" series in general. Following Sita's journey is an exciting and wonderful adventure, and this book is no exception. Sita is 5,000 years old and thought all vampires (aside from herself and her lover Ray) were gone, until a series of unusal murders force her to realize she was mistaken. She must meet this new foe, destroy him, and try to do so without destroying herself. A great (and quick) read."
2,Cats don't know what to do with it,I have two cats. One did spend some 15 minutes or so laying on it and using the scratch section but the other hasn't been near it nor has the other one now. I've left it in their room in hopes they finally do use it.
3,"Cats loved it, wish it was sturdier though","My cats loved this so much that they thoroughly destroyed it.... knocked the brushes off and broke the tabs that held them in place ... knocked the dome out of the middle and broke the tabs there too. And the brushes popped off when they rubbed their faces on them. GREAT idea.... better execution would be helpful though. I ended up putting all the plastic in recycling because it became unusable after they'd whomped on it for a couple of months.If they improve it and make it sturdier, I'd be interested in buying the newer version. As it is, much as the cats loved it, I can't see buying another one just to see it thoroughly thrashed in short shrift.That nubby thing on the top of the dome was amazing to watch them with though.... they rubbed their gums on that with great bliss on their faces.... clearly it was some form of cat-understanding genius on that. Hopefully they'll revamp enough to make it hold up better."
3,too tight,"I find the case a bit too tight for the printer.. where are all of you putting the printer's handle? It doesn't fit in the bag if it is put all the way to the back or front of the printer. And leaving it in front, near the top of the printer makes me feel like it will break if the bag gets bumped .... what am I doing wrong that the handle seems to be ill-fitted in the carrying case?"
4,A solid MP3 player that can be expanded to 1 Gig.,"I like MP3 players that have some type of expandable memory. So if all I can afford is smaller storage MP3 players then at least I have the option to expand its memory later when I have more money to spend. Additionally I don't like MP3 players with rechargeable batteries. I have to carry a re-charger and if the rechargeable battery dies when I am on the road, I have to wait until I find an electrical outlet to charge it again in order to use it. With a non-rechargeable battery I can always buy batteries off-the-shelf and if the MP3 player has a long-playtime on one battery then I don't have to carry a lot of spare batteries with me. The Rio Forge had all these qualities + a good sound quality although I replaced the headphones with a better pair."
3,Remanufactured Rio Forge Sport MP-3 Player,"I like the player. However, I am a reader of audio books and I download books from the local library using NetLibrary. I am having difficulty using book marks and the resume feature to keep my place when the player is shut off. Rio tells me it has something to do with the NetLibrary platform. Called NetLibrary and they tried to help, but I'm stiill having trouble with certain books. Otherwise I like the player for quality of sound and listening to downloaded music."
4,Fine Melodic Death Metal,"After listening to this cd, I could really tell that In Thy Dreams is greatly influenced by At The Gates. The Singer really sounds like the singer of At The Gates, as well as the drumming. The guitars on this album are stellar, but unfortunately there are no solos :( But if you like At The Gates, or anything fast and melodic, buy this album."
1,"one word ""Blasphemy""","This book has been very successful in alienating muslims around the world. Just by putting a ""picture"" of the The prophet of God the author has proven his incompetence. How can the author just randomly select a picture and use it for such a great personality. This is utterly blasphemous. How can such a book even get past a review done by a person with a positive value for common sense? The only decent thing that the author and the publishers of this book can do apologize and remove the picture from the book."
1,it's hurting for the muslims,The use of Imaginative picture of Prophet Mohammad(peace be upon him)is very hurting for all the muslims and is completely unacceptable. This clearly indicates the authenticity of this book and the knowledge & maturity of the author. I strongly condemn this act done deliberately or carelessly on the part of the author & urge the Publisher to remove this picture and other related material.
2,Ragbag collection of soul artiste covers of the Fab 4,"The covers of Beatles songs being collected in LP/CD collections has produced over the years some gems of both well known covers and rare finds. This issue is sadly not one of them.The separate Motown collection of Beatles songs by major artistes on that label showed that sometimes the Tamla magic could not work its soul spell on the UK group songs. This collection is a Rhino special and covers a variety of non-Tamla soul artists - sadly the quality is variable. Aretha (Let it be) and Wilson Pickett (Hey Jude) shine, Booker T & the MGs have done much better on their Abbey Road tribute than the cover of Michelle on show here, and some are plain embarrassing (Billy Preston on Get Back given he was on the original recording and the Bar-Kays ""We can work it out"").I fear this is one of the least interesting Beatles cover collections I have heard."
5,jeff buckley,"has nice covers of dylan and others, lots a talkin though, best ever Halleluya cover enjoy most of it and big fans of Jeff will enjoy the live banter"
3,not too bad,"Slow at first, and not a lot of action, but the powerful descriptions of the land and the in-depth characters make up for it in a way. This book spans a time period of 1917 to 1939 and takes place primarily in Quebec, Canada. It tells the story of several french-canadians and english-canadians, and their struggle to get by and to find themselves amidst the bitterness between the french and the english in war-time Canada. It's not the most enlightening book i've read, but i gave the Canadian author credit- it wasn't a waste of time to read."
3,Interesting,It was a little difficult to get into the authors mind-set. He had a message to convey. I did enjoy the book. I am collecting books about and from Southeaster Asia (Indochina) and I would probably not purchased this book if it weren't for that.
4,What If Peter Gabriel Stayed With Genesis?,"This excelent release from the Italian prog-meisters The Watch attempts to answer that question, and it largely succeeds.It's certainly NOT a full-out clone but the influence is certainly there, and strong tracks like ""--And The Winner Is--"" for example show great care, top-notch writing and musicianship with an ear for memorable melody and a great sense of humor (however obtuse).Definitely a worthy listen."
3,Promising beginning but smeared eyeliner / rolls of fat,"Picked this book up and enjoyed the verbal foreplay in the first chapter. The strong writing continued at times, but ultimately, the randy Mrs. Amberg has her makeup smeared and runs badly out of steam.Falls in that category of book where a reader asks: would this book be published except for 1. author lives in NY; 2. her friends reviewed it; 3. surprise--plot is about a desperate housewife in NY, sex, and the accompanying blah blah blah. Not sure if I cared any longer by the end, which didn't some soon enough."
2,"Don't bother to sit, watch TV instead","Found it a bit heavy and dull. Utterly boring. 11 more words neeed, what can I say? Awful! 2 more? No, no!!"
5,Great Sandals!!!,These sandals are so soft and comfortable and really easy to get on and off. My daughter loves them.
5,LOVED IT,"I loved this cookbook - I got another WLS cookbook (I won't mention any names) but, this one is SO much better. It's full of recipes that I will use rather than having the cookbook sit on the shelf collecting dust because the recipes are far to complicated. This is THE WLS cookbook!"
2,Nokia hands free ear bud,"Very disappointed. While the outgoing voice is recieved clear on the other end, the incoming voices sound distant, and are muffled."
4,I loved this book!,"Unless I am mistaken by a similar title, this book is one I wish to buy. I read the book many years ago, while in high school, & am very glad to find it is still available. I would like for my daughter to read it now. It tells of Kate's days when she stayed here in my hometown, in what is now the home of my friend. In the book she journals her days at both the hospital site, and the house. I have spent many days at both the house & the Old Stone Church, one of the hospital sites in our area. I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves civil war history, and/or nursing history."
2,typical school book...,"Buy it for class, use it, and then sell it to get most of your money back... Its not something you will want to keep."
5,This is the new bible for internet marketing,"It is a clear, concise and step by step guide to developing and growing a successful internet marketing business. Tom Antion is one the formost experts in internet marketing and he shares all of his secrets. A must have reference book for your library!!"
3,Good info BUT ...,"A lot of good information here, but the author also pushes his other products constantly throughout the book. It's a perfect example of the marketing techniques he's writing about, but I found it a little annoying."
1,Beware of this book!,The book is simply a marketing platform for the authors products. He even tries to get you to make him money by clicking his own affiliate marketing programs.
1,A 294 page advertisement for the author's products,"A 294 page advertisement for the author's products and services. But what's far worse is his ""recommendation"" for a shopping cart system that re-prints the URL hundreds of times and more importantly never even mentions once that the cart system web pages have his name right on the bottom of every page or that he has any association with the product whatsoever! The author doesn't seem to realize that you lose all credibility when you repeatedly ""recommend"" various products and services without mentioning even once that they are your own."
4,sad and lonesome voice,"No question this an album of a type, intended for bruised hearts and slow drinking. Taken as a whole, the album can feel a little monotone, but take select tracks and mix them in a playlist, and the aching and mid tempo fit in nicely. Best tracks are, ""She Ain't no You"", ""Some Tears"", and ""I was so Lonesome""."
4,Achingly warm & beautiful,"Puts me in mind of the best of Dwight Yoakam. Do yourself a favor and get this and the Caitlin Cary collaboration, ""Begonias""."
3,wow shes a ghost,"these dolls ur ok.yeah if u got one u could pretend it was a ghost,haunting the other Bratz."
3,Super Reader,"I enjoyed this knockoff/homage or whatever you want to call it. Seems it was done in a pretty good spirit.Alan Morgan, a bored lawyer, is out hunting, when a timber wolf takes serious umbrage at being shot at.Luckily for Alan a Llarnian disembodied supermind from a planet in the Canopus system decides to hyperspace him the hell out of there at that time.Adventures with princess of a different hue, psionicist-faux wizards, imprisonment, political struggles and more follow.Luckily for Alan, he's a fencing champ. This, and his heavier gravity muscles make him the greatest swordsman on his new home."
3,"An inexpensive, good fire alarm.","I bought 3 of these a few months ago. My wife and I cook a lot and were getting many false alarms from cooking food with the BRK fire alarms. This fire alarm works MUCH better at false alarms. It's only gone off once since purchase, however when it did, the silence button only worked for about 10 seconds at a time, which is very annoying. The instructions say the silence should last for 8 minutes. I was forced to unplug the unit until cooking was done.Update 2/24/09: The 8 minute silence does work - the silence button needs to be pushed in once to silence the alarm, and again to activate the 8 minute delay. It will glow red when the pause is active. This is a 5-star fire detector, but for some reason Amazon won't let me change the 3 star rating."
1,The smoke detector from hell.,This smoke detector goes off 2AM in the morning and its a false alarm. The silence button is malfunctioning and the smoke detector is jammed into my ceiling so Im having time trying to shut it up. This whole time the alarm is hurting my ears as my head is only a foot away. I finally unplug it from the power wires from my ceiling and get this: IT STILL BEEPS. I thinking its haunted at this point. It finally dies half a minute later.Its like a monster from a horror flick.
1,It's more a grammar than a language course,"If your intention is to learn to speak Maltese, just don't buy this book since it won't be helpful at all. It is more a grammar than a language course and it would be ideal for those who have already learnt the basics of Maltese and wish to have a grammatical reference whenever they hesitate about the language rules. Very few exercises and quizes, and not useful at all in which concerns to learning Maltese, no dialogues in the whole book, and very ""hard"" explanations about the language. I gave it one star because of its cover, which is the only nice thing in the book. If you're looking for a good language course in order to learn Maltese, my recommendation is to buy ""Beginning Maltese"", by Lydia Sciriha (University Of Malta)."
4,bells,"If you like to hear bells this is for you. They sometimes get in the way of the music, but bells are for Christmas, aren't they? All the traditional American Christmas music is on this cd. They are played very well, but sometimes you have to break with tradition. I really wish that there would have been some other carols, like ""in the bleak midwinter"" or ""three Kings"". Other than that and maybe too many bells, I would reccomend this cd."
2,Great Purchase,I had this album in album format was really happy to find it at such a reasonable price in the CD format.
5,Christmas Heirloom,"I having always wanted an original music box, but never being able to afford one, when I can across this CD I knew it was for me. The CD captures the Victorian era music boxes and transforms any listener with the true essence of Christmas!"
1,Don't buy from Oregon Scientific,"I purchased this product last year. It worked fine for 6 weeks, and then some of the electronic components burned out or something. I contacted the company and they told me to mail them the speaker and they would send me a replacement. That was 4 months ago, and I still do not have a replacement. I have called them, left messages, and emailed them. I have been told by 3 different employees that the replacement speaker would be sent ""right out."" I just filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and hope I can get some justice finally. Beware of this company!!!! Their customer service is TERRIBLE!!"
1,Not what I expected from this product,"Extreme Styling Treatment did nothing to help me style my curly hair. It made my hair very soft, too soft, and thus I was unable to get the smooth style I wanted. My hair was flyaway. I get better results just by leaving in my conditioner that I use after shampooing."
5,The Grand Escape,"I am an elementary school library media specialist and read this book aloud to children of all ages. We all love it! It is humorous and curious and the mystery always keeps the students' attention. You can't go wrong here. Anyone who has cats will be especially entertained. A real winner!M PowellRoswell, Ga."
4,This book is okay!,"This 'fun filled' adventure is your tipical average book. It's a story about cats who run away, just like any other cat book!"
1,A guide in misusing Biblical texts,"This book should really be entitled 'Beyond Reasonable Scholarship.' Dr Jacobs bases his argument on the false claim that Jewish tradition only countenances a single author for Psalms i.e. King David. Then he goes on to infer that as this is untrue (how could David write about future events?) the belief in the divine authorship of the five books of Moses must also be untrue. This is blatant nonsence as Dr Jacobs must know.There are several Talmudic references to Psalms as a composite work and many later commentators such as David Kimkhi and the Malbim also explain how Psalms was the work of over 10 authors, edited in his generation by David and that later editions added Psalms written in the Babylonian exile. Therefore the supposed authorship of Psalms has not a jot to do with the authorship of the Pentateuch. This a bad book full of bad scholarship. It is also an insult to any academic or traditionally learned Jew who is aware of the sources."
5,Perfect EDC!!!!,I LOVE this knife! It is the perfect size! It is very sturdy and razor sharp right out of the box. The clip holds it to just the right height out of your pocket and the handles keep it very lightweight. And the price was around 1/3 of what the manufacturer is asking.
4,Nice for th price.,Very nice knife for the price. Plastic plating for handles was a small let down. But still a great pocket knife!
5,Great Knife,This knife is al some it's a must have to anyone thinking about it. the blade is good steel and light weight. I love mine
5,good knife for 14 $,"I like it, AutoLAWKS work perfectly, very sharp I own Cold Steel pendleton hunter and even Cold Steel was not so sharp, of course VG-1 is more better than AUS-4 but CRKT was more sharper, I like its size and tanto style."
3,Not as good as I expected,"This book is good for beginners, but I've already tried EVERYTHING Dr. Condrell said before ever buying this book (WITHOUT reading it in a book, or magazine, or getting advice from my pediatrician), and it STILL doesn't work! I guess maybe I have an extra stubborn 3 year old, but nothing in his book is news to me. Was a waste of my money!"
4,You either love him or hate him.,Paolo Conte is a great musician. I think is voice and style of music is great. This new cd is a great continuation of his previous cd. As mentioned in the previous review his starting song 'Elegia' set the stage for the cd with great vocals and instruments accompanying him. Then 'Sandwich Man' is going to be a classic with the way he shows his emotions from his voice. 'ChissÀ' is another track that I enjoyed with the joyous music and korky voice combination.Overall the cd is worth your time and money if you enjoy his music.Enjoy.
5,My own opinion....,"The Great White Stanhope was my first CD done through UproarRecords and was, if nothing else, a good learning experience in notletting other people have all the say. I was not involved in any part of the production of this CD beyond telling the jokes to sparse crowds in Reno. The editing, selection of material, and final cover art were all done without my final o.k. and suffered as a result. I am far too rushed and gasping making the album a little overbearing for the living room. I made ""Sicko"" basically to replace this album, hence the overlapping of material. Although I don't care for The Great White Stanhope, it's still got my name on it so...5 stars."
5,PERFECT!!!,"This is the best Evangelion video I have got as of yet. This keeps up my knowledge that Neon Genesis Evangelion is the best anime show in all creation. They are always funny, exiting, dramatic, emotional, and PERFECT!!!"
4,Good but there are a few flaws,I bought this cat tree for my deck and I'm happy with it overal.The flaws are:1. There was no paper manual for assembling but it was compensated by guiding marks right on wooden parts so I did it easily.2. The top perch isn't very easy for cats to climb or jump on from the middle purch because the former overhangs pretty much.
2,Another dead theory,"Susan Blackmore uses skeptical arguments against the Near-Death Experience (NDE) that have been proven wrong for over 15 years. Research by Dr. Raymond Moody, Cardiologist Michael Sabom, Dr. Melvin Morse, and others have conclusively demonstrated the absurdity of Blackmore's claims of a 'dying brain' being at the heart of the NDE.Furthermore, current research into NDEs in the blind have shown amazing results which conclusively demonstrate that 'something' leaves the body upon physical death.Blackmore and others like her will no doubt continue to debunk immortality until they, too, join the ranks of the living dead.This book is better suited as a paper weight."
2,Skeptic and absurd!,Ms.Blackmore tries to debunk any (if not all)previous studies on the NDE phenomena by looking for answers (her own) that are still within the absurd and incredible. Why can this narrow minded scientist accept the truth? The evidence on life after death is so staggering and compelling that no matter how hard she tries ..it will still be there! The spirit lives after the body dies!
5,GET THIS BOOK!,"If your taking the lsat and self prepping this is the book to get. I always heard people talking about how good the bibles were and after purchasing them I definetely agree. No other book even comes close to these in my opinion. Everything is explained clearly, many examples, and helpful diagramming exercises."
2,Good for Basics,"This book is okay if you are totally bewildered by the games section. However, this book does not help much with timing. The book isn't good for preparing for games with few restrictive rules in them. The last few pages of the book is how newer games are constructed. Paradoxially the info is skimpy towards the end of the book. It seems like the book just needs to be updated and a little less self congratulating."
1,Very disappointing,"This book was not at all what I expected. As a member of middle management I was looking for suggestions on motivating employees on more of an individual basis. Most of the ideas in this book I felt need to be implemented by upper management throughout the entire organization. As supervisor of a small department, I do not have the resources or authority to implement these types of changes. Also, most of the ideas would only work in businesses with high customer contact. For those of us that work only within the organization, most of these ideas are not applicable."
3,orchid,"this book was a good read, but I found it not as good as Amaryllis,and Zinnia, still fun, but just not up to the other two."
1,?,This is a weird doll she looks like a goth. I don't know why they are dressed mostle in black and they r fun but it might not be the best 4 younger kids but for more older kids like 8 or 10.
3,Kinda cute???,"This doll was my very first Bratz doll and i think shes very different from my other dolls i now have. i think the iii candy dolls are really wierd and really oringal some how, theres nothing i mean NOTHING like these. Oh well, her hair is very durable the most durable hair on dolls ever. what i hate the most about these dlls is that they come with colored legs, it sucks! you cant put them in different outfits unless you put ugly pants on them but i do like the outfits they come in but not Yasmins, i dont like her hair either so thats why i didnt get her. my favorite bratz dolls are the campfire* & the winter wonderland* those dolls ROCK!!!"
3,Bratz rule but......,"i love bratz dolls alot especially cloe but this line of ""i-candy"" dolls?? Sorry i don't thnk so. Actually the dolls itself are ok but its the clothing i dislike. Basically they look like bubblegum pop followers. Overall i give it a 3."
4,The best buy,Definitely the best stuff among other products. I have used TM6000 for 15ys. I purchased TM6000b to replace the old one with monitor gone bad.
5,Ancient Secrets of the Horse's Mind,One of the very best books of this type I have EVER read. I came away with a far greater understanding of why horses react/respond as they do and recommend this book to anyone who loves and deals with these wonderful creatures.
5,Great book.,I bought this book after reading someone elses. Couldn't find a used copy and thought this was over priced but when it comes to why horses behave the way they do this book is really to the point. Lots of information in a small book. It was worth paying full retail to have this to refer to. Other more experienced horse owner may disagree but I've been looking for information to help me with my horse and appreciated the straight forward way the information was presented.
2,One good song TIME trippy,Well I have the record I can't get any radio stations to play the song and i want people to listen to time Cause its a trip
4,For Collectors,I purchased this book for my son who is a Simpson's fan and collector. It was not quite what we expected but in all is a very different piece for collectors.My son can pretty much recite every episode by heart and there were still information in this book that he was unfamiliar with.Over all it is worth the price for a collector to have something with a twist to add to the collection.
5,Cool Simpsons Album,The Simpson's are one of those families that you gotta love and this picture album is tops when it comes to learning things about the Simpson's that you didn't know or refreshing the things that you do know. It's funny and is a great gift idea for any Simpson's fan!
1,Fair warning!,"The information given says the bag is 18"" wide. It is not. It is 14"" wide. My bass, a DeArmond Starfire doesn't fit in the bag, and I am returning it. If anybody wants to take a moment to go through the steps, you can get a pre-paid UPS return label from amazon and send it back at no cost.Now question is, will Amazon correct the information. Probably not."
3,"""Virgin Earth""","This book is very long and at times tedious. Gregory has vivid descriptions of EVERYthing. Her characters were good. We reviewed this in book club and after discussion, I found out I remembered and enjoyed more than I realized!"
2,Annoying Main Character,"I usually love Philippa Gregory's books. But this one, for me, was lacking. The main character was frankly annoying--from the beginning of the book to its VERY disappointing ending. I agree with another poster who had a hard time understand how three intelligent women could love this guy. The reason I gave it two stars (instead of one or none) was because the book did have its moments. The time spent in early Virgina and the look into the lives of King Charles I and the story behind the English civil war were interesting. I just wish the story could have been told from another main character's perspective."
4,Pop goes Barbra,"It was the late 60's and protest was big, so she contributed a collection of thought provoking songs (""Ask Yourself Why"") mixed with some whimsy(""Honey Pie"") as well."
2,crossroads in her career,"If there's one thing to say about this album it's that it's unusual - rather eclectic even; Regarding the two tracks 'Honey Pie' by the Beatles, and 'I get by with a little help from my friends', Neither song feels right on this disc. I cannot fault the singing here but the material falls short of her voice and it shows.Seems a bit 'Thrown together' but interesting......."
3,Steamer,I don't feel there is anything wrong with the product. It just seems more difficult to use than I am willing to do. I have given it to a person that was happy as a clam to get it.
2,really not worth it,I was able to use this as a an option eating steam foods only but it really does not work and takes longer to steam food. really not worth it andwas really disappointed....
4,Aids Healthy Eating,"This is a very attractive item to sit out on the counter, etc. It cooks quickly. I like the outside water indicator, however, it is a little hard to see being clear water and a clear over over the indicator."
2,Nicely designed,"Nicely designed but baskets are cheapest pieces of garbage (very thin easily scratched or cracked plastic) I have ever bought. Must be made in China. If you have kids around, don't buy."
4,Not BPA free!,"There are so many different opinions about this machine that you do not know what to think. I had an old Sunbeam steamer for years that had a plastic 5pp white rice tray. It finally stopped working so I purchased this. This steamer is wonderful, but the rice tray is 7pc which releases BPA. I saved my old rice tray to use in this steamer, so for me this unit is perfect. I do not understand why they do not include trays that contain safe plastic...it is so easy to do! Great unit other than that concern!"
1,worse steamer I ever had,My wife and I had a 20 year old black & decker vegtable steamer that finally stopped working. I reviewed several steamers at Amazon and found the Oster 5712 steamer had many positive reviews. I purchased it and it just didn't put out much steam and everything took longer than their manual said. This included lightly loading the steamer. Our old black & decker steamer could be fully loaded and took way less time. Also it had a warning light that indicated water level was low when the water level wasn't low. I will never buy another Oster steamer.
1,Not for the lazy,"I'm lazy, I admit it. Sometimes I don't get around to cleaning this a day or two after I've used it. As everyone else who rates it a one, its impossible to drain completely from the little inlet thing. Yea you can still use vodka or vinegar to clean it out when it gets all nasty, but really it would be nicer if you could just dump it upside down to empty all the water out."
1,Bothersome cleanup,"This unit may steam as well as others, but the external water fill/gauge compartment is connected to the main reservoir by a small hole. There is no way to clean the external fill compartment.This unit defines an over designed product. I must concede that the really great part about the see-through water level indicator is that you can see when mold starts growing in there. Then you know when you need to go get some bleach and let it soak for half an hour.Look for a steamer that doesn't have a separate fill compartment and you'll be much happier."
2,BPA free?,"Oster 5712 Electronic 2-Tier 6-Quart Food Steamer4/22/12Before considering any FOOD STEAMER I want to have a certification from a independent testing laboratory in the United States that certifies.""There is no lead in the stainless steel.There is no Biphenyl A (BPA) in the plastic parts"".Robert Flynn Orange County CA"
5,Steamer,Used this steamer on several occasions and it works great. I especially like the separate sections and the larger size. I had previously had a B & D model and it never was quite big enough. This one is perfect
4,Great item,"I can't cook much but this thing steamed everything (except brown rice) perfectly. Everything I've ever put in, has come out just right. My only complaint is there's lots of parts to wash. Our dish washer isn't that big and this thing almost fills it up."
5,Wonderfuly Flexible Steamer,From the unpacking to the eating - great experience. The 2 containers of different size alows a large choice of quantity to steam. The control panel is natural to operate and the dispaly size very comfortable. I like the feature allowing adding water during steaming. The weight of the unit is surprisingly light. I can't think of any feature that is missing.
4,basket case,"I have had this steamer since 2002 and it is still working fine. It heats up very quickly--it continuously takes a small amount of water to boil. Unlike the traditional steamer, the whole pot of water has to boil before any steaming can be done. This electronic steamer only takes second to produce steam. It is very efficient. It also has a drip pan so that the water in the reservoir is not contaminated. There is an external water fill system which is very handy- just add water as it is steaming. If a prolong steaming is required, one might want to check on the drop tray--making sure the drip tray does not overflow into the reservoir where the heating element is. The digital display is a plus- two buttons, up and down (for the timer). Only reason not giving a five star is because of the smaller tray with the egg holders. The little indentations are difficult to wash by hand. Overall it is a very good teamer."
5,Meets all my expectations,"Easy to use and excellent in all its applications. I've made rice, broccoli, green beans, steamed squash. It is easy to fill and VERY reliable."
2,Boring...,I love reading DS book. I've read so many of her books and it never took me as long to finish them. Too boring.
4,Cold Packs Help Pain,"I have on going chronic pain and these ice packs are great to put in your pocket, purse, car or most anywhere. They get icy cold instantly and sure help calm down pain and spasms. I bought a whole case of them."
4,Assisted Living,J. Allen is very knowledgeable on the subject and I would suggest a person or company to get this book if thinking about asisted living in any way.
1,save your money,"this album does not represent all the wonderful sounds of Enigma, the mixes are terrible and a major disappointment to real fans, save your money"
2,"Uh, no. Save your money!","Aside from maybe one or two songs on this album, it sucks. Plain and simple. This album just has no soul and the sound majority of it is just pure rubbish. At best it's a new rendezvous with an old fling. For at most two songs.I would seriously try to talk you out of buying this album unless you are simply an Enigma collector that MUST have it.My feeling is that everything Enigma has done after the second album is rubbish but because that first one was so good, I'm always hoping that they will, ahem, return to innocence. ;) But I'm always disappointed (it just gets worse and worse with every release) when I buy the latest offering. If that's how you feel then this album should get no consideration from you. There's no happy ending here.And will someone please tell the guy to quit trying to sing??? It's like with each album he's singing more and more. Doesn't he understand that he is an AWFUL vocalist? Obviously not.Save your money. :)"
2,A good lotion with unacceptable scent,"Before you start to apply it on your skin, the overwhelming smell will totally disappoint you. The ""scent"" is too strong for a lotion. People around you will be scared by the smell. Don't buy it unless you knew you love the smell of patchouli. But it is still a little too much."
2,"Good moisture from the lotion, but the scent ...","Good moisture from the lotion, but the scent is very overpowering. It was far too strong for me, but it was a quality lotion."
3,"The lotion made my skin feel good, but ...","The lotion made my skin feel good, but I didn't care for the smell. It was really, really strong."
3,I liked the moisturizing aspect of this lotion. ...,I liked the moisturizing aspect of this lotion. It kept my skin moist for along time and didn't leave it greasy feeling. I didn't like the scent and noticed no aromatherapeutic effects. I'd recommend it to friends as a great moisturizer to use on hands and rough spots.
5,Excellent book to understand contemporary Spain,"The book covers the last three decades of Spanish history and provides a critical introduction to the politics and government of Spain.Written from a moderate-left viewpoint, this book is for those who already have an interest in the subject and who want to use it as a very up to date toolbox for the study of Spain."
2,Did not fit older model Mossberg 500CT,"I have an older model Mossberg 500CT (20 gauge, North Haven Conn. manufacture; see image here [...]). The Pachmayr recoil pad is 5mm too short and 3mm to wide for stock. I suspect the recoil pad is designed for recently manufactured guns. I'm considering buying a slip-on pad instead.Installing the pad does not require any gunsmithing, but you do have to drill additional holes into the butt of the stock to attach the new recoil pad. The recoil pad itself seems well made. I may give it a try, ugly as it will be, and follow up with the results."
1,YIKES!!,"This doll looks like it is dressed up for Halloween or something! Its make up is wayyy too much, and the clothes are sooooooo ugly! I do love Bratz, though. I DO recomend London Yasmin,though--She rules!!"
5,Amazing intro,"Reading Jonas is always a pleasure; the way he divides and presents the field is still useful, despite the many discoveries that have occurred since book's publication.Most useful for people with a philosophical background: while (excepting the final chapter) the book is in no way 'philosophy,' Jonas thinks like a philosopher; he brings Gnostic figures and myths into a kind of dialogue with philosophy (especially Stoicism)."
1,shipled without a top on the bottle,"I received this product with no top on the bottle, just the usual paper seal. After I break the seal and use it once how am I to reseal the bottle, with a part of my anatomy that shall remain nameless? The person who packaged it could plainly see that there was no top which is why they're packing stuff in the warehouse. I feel much better now."
3,Too Thin,"I have had several jobs that get ""non-removable"" stuff on my shoes.I have tried several way to avoid this.These will work in a really minimal use and low friction environment. Otherwise they are really useless.I have found that they suits with the feet attached are really the best.Only for very, very lightweight usage."
4,"Good shoe covers, but not as durable as I had hoped","These are the only shoe covers that came up when I searched Amazon for ""outdoor shoe covers"" so I had hoped that they would be a little stronger than typical shoe covers. I was looking for something I could cover my shoes/boots with when I go outside to clean up after my dog. These might be a little stronger than some of the others, but they are definitely intended for use inside. One of these got a hole while I was walking around outside, likely from a twig. I have started to double up and use two pairs on each shoe/boot, and that works pretty well. Please not that if you do intend to use these outside, as I have, you will need to be very careful when walking since it is much more slippery, especially after it has rained."
2,Not the A.F.I. I want to hear...,"One of my favorite bands, but this CD doesn't do it for me. These guys had such a raw sound on their earlier work, but their sound is changing. This album is very 80's/Grunge with elements of good punk scattered throughout. I know that groups change styles, and that's normally good to see how bands are changing, but I have no use for this style. I say let Glen Danzig do his own thing, and let A.F.I get back to the roots! Some may like this, but it is very different. Way too melodramatic for me, but keep rockin' fellas!"
2,from punk to metal,"Sorry, but after falling in love with ""Very Proud Of Ya"" and then getting the fisrt album ""Answer That.."", I bought this album and it's just not even close to the same style. This is much more like heavy metal than punk. All of those people who reveiwed this album with five stars either haven't heard their previous material or just like metal more than punk. This album gets to collect dust next to other metal albums disguised as punk rock(see bands such as Snapcase and Ensign)"
1,You call this MUSIC???,"Haha...riiight. Listening to screaming guys....no thanks, I'll pass on that. You want real vocal talent? Check out Jesse McCartney, Clay Aiken, and Greg Raposo"
3,Good for beginners,"Just a plain basic product for beginners or someone not wanting to invest in more expensive molds. Since it is made of thin plastic, don't expect it to last a long time. Also be sure to hand wash."
2,There's a lot better mascara,Someone is giving deceptive information about the Imju Fiberwig mascara. I have tried everything on the market and this one can't compare to the lowest price mascaras on the market! Don't waste your money on this one. The one nice thing is that it does come off with water and doesn't flake but my lashes don't look any fuller/thicker. I have put multiple layers on and I still can't get the look they claim! Lash Perfection by MAX (waterproof) does a better job. If you want to spend more money DIORSHOW WATERPROOF mascara is much better than Imju Fiberwig mascara.
2,IT'S JUST A ZIT,"Eva (Jessica Morris) is in prison and wants to go straight. She is bullied and abused. Her daughter while visiting her gives her some tiny worry dolls. These dolls enter her head through her ear and takes control over her while manifesting themselves as a big zit in the middle of her forehead which on occasion opens up to reveal a tiny miniature bloody skull.The acting is fairly bad. The prison scenario is cliche. The horror aspect was more of a joke. Not bad enough to be in the Ed Wood category, and not good enough to pass as worthwhile entertainment. This is part of a 20 Horror DVD set available at Wal Mart for $5.00. Might be worth a free Prime watch if you are desperate for bad entertainment and stoned.Parental Guide: F-bomb, Full frontal shower nudity, off screen rape with object."
4,really cute ear rings,"I love the fact that these are sterling silver. We have metal allergies in my family. When you open the door, the little man falls out of the outhouse. Really cute."
1,Didn't Work For Me,"I really didn't think there could be much of a difference between face washes, but this one definitely didn't mesh with my (fairly normal, I thought) skin. It dried out my eye area so badly that it's actually bright red and rough, and somehow managed to increase my usual frequency of blemishes.I'm sure this stuff could work wonders for someone, but I definitely wasn't that person."
4,The glitter and the gold,It captured the times and mood really well. It gave enough personnel information to keep it interesting and relative for today's times.
5,Very Funny!,"This album is really good. This is one of their best albums and I love it. Track 13 on the cd is really funny, when matthew and father are speaking. The best on the cd are probably power up and highballs which are brilliant. Goodbye (track 8)"
5,Enthralling and beautiful.,"A must-have for any fan of the medium of comics. Wonderful stories, fully-realised characters, charming artwork."
3,Just Ok,The quality of this DVD was not great. Two of the four episodes were all static filled and the picture was washed out! Not too happy.
1,Empty Calories,"I am really disappointed in this beand as they are marketing this to kids. 4% Iron and no other vitamins?? With childhood obesity a t epidemic proportions, why would ANYONE feed their children all of these empty calories?? It is like giving them Coke or Pepsi for BREAKFAST!! OK ORGANIC Coke but still Coke!! I am sad because I have heard great things about this brand and really like what they are doing for endangered species!! But they are not thinking about their target consumer CHILDREN!"
4,I liked it more than i didn't but not as much as i should ;),"This overall good story it feels that it was written by two authors and it is not clear if i really liked this book or not.Therefore if i was asked to review this book in one phrase,I would say,I liked it more than i didn't but not as much as i should ;)The introduction of characters and situations lasted more than anticipated, it took pretty much half of the book to get me where i expected and i enjoyed it from then on.There are some genuine moments where you really felt the hero and the situation, but although the focus is meant to be the city and not the heroes themselves, apart from a certain moments, i found it to lack the lush descriptive language that it would require to describe the locations the City of Splendors, the Grand City of Waterdeep.There were some minor print layout issues towards the middle.I gave this book four stars as an average, this rating doesn't apply overall. first Parts are 3+, others i would rate as 4.5"
2,Grade= D+ Fair to Poor,"This is a slow story that fails to hold the readers interest, it is difficult to read due to lack luster settings and prose, and populated with un-interesting characters. The plot is silly and boring, I did not care at all about story line or the characters, and found this completely dull.Overall= D+Readability= D, Character= D, Plot= D, Setting= D, Action= D+, Romance= D+."
3,"Thin, but insightful","Of course Nietzsche is famous for his misogyny, yet David Krell unearths neglected material in order to demonstrate a more complex and nuanced relationship to woman in Nietzsche's thought. Krell examines Nietzsche's planned attempt to write a rendition of Empedocles, which is postponed indefinitely, thus giving us a window into Nietzsche's fundamental failure to really deal with the theme of woman. There are also fascinating accounts of abandoned versions of 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra,' which indicates a failure to confront death. However, Krell's concluding remarks are rather limited-he suggests that Nietzsche's problematic relation to woman was a consequence of the women in his own life. The suggestion is probably correct, but Krell fails to really explore the idea, though it would clearly require another study all together."
3,New or used???,"I thought this was a new product; maybe it is,but it looks like someone wrapped it at home with plastic wrap. Speedy delivery, & it arrived safely packed."
1,Worst power cord ever,"The power cord wire burnt out all by itself within three weeks. I had bought two of these and they both had the same fate. Therefore, it is not a one off thing, they are of poor quality. Put your money in something more durable."
5,very good movie,"If you want this movie on DVD, buy the VHS and it can be recorded onto a DVD with all your other favorite Christmas movies!"
3,Its just another product,"I have oily and dry skin (yeah its great...) and I bought this considering many online reviews said it is one of the best. It was very drying and didn't necessarily reduce anything overnight. After several uses, and switching between the product and some basic lotion, my acne did lighten a bit, but it wasn't near perfect. Its worth a try, but don't expect a miracle cream."
4,This products clears up acne quickly. Great product....,This products clears up acne quickly. Great product.
4,Immediate Results,"After the first night of using this product, I saw an obvious reduction in my pimple. The pimple was not gone completely, but it was definitley smaller and less visible. Although product says it's a gel, it's more of a white, pastey cream. The main con is that I paid $6.00 for the product on Amazon, and I have since seen the same product in the local dollar store for half the price."
5,For All Western Lovers,This collection is well worth the money. Randolph Scott at his best. Very well directed and acted. Well above the average western and very entertaining.
1,"How many, and which, movies","The cover art says that it is a two disc set, and the price is double the regular price indicating that there are, in fact, two discs included. However only four titles are shown and the reviews only mention four titles.What, exactly, is being sold?"
4,I recommend this product,"It's a good product! It makes your sweet spot smell fresh, does not smell like a perfume, does not leave a special aroma, just clean fresh smell. It seems it keeps that sensitive skin hydrated."
4,nice book,"I wish there had been an age attached to this book as I'm sure my grandson will love it when he is older, but not now for his 4th birthday. I'll save it for a year or two."
2,"The ""old"" Strategy Guide",I'm an adult--agewise. This book will not be much help beyond the game guide that came with the game software. The basic strategy recommendation for single player was made obsolete by a software patch released after the strategy guide was published. One or two minor points were in the strategy guide that I did not pick up from the game documentation. The game website has better strategy hints for free! Save your money for something better or an updated edition. The multiplayer strategy said than human players were unpredictable and most of the single player strategies were not appropriate. There's a news flash for the cable news channels!!!
3,"Design of FRP and Steel Plated RC Structures: Retrofitting Beams and Slabs for Strength, Stiffness and Ductility","Quite a good book but but certainly written more for the academic than for the practitioner who is normally after a quick, reliable, simple solution. Should have added another chapter that said ""If you are happy to take a conservative approach and anchor this far past inflection points then this is the solution"". This would have saved me reading the whole book cover to cover to design one job."
2,lacking in everything,"Okay, so I bought this book thinking it would be a useful reference book. It's not. Yes, it has a bunch of illustrations, but it gives no reference information to go with the plates--which, by the way, are simply awful line drawings, some of which are badly colored in to the detriment of the pictures.Do not buy this book if you want to learn what things are called, the time periods in which they were used, or any specific, detailed information about variations in the general styles for a specific period in time.On the other hand, if you just want some reference pictures for designign your kid's Halloween costume, then you have plenty to go by."
3,General,Gives a basic and brief coverage of both male and female costume from different periods and cultures. mixture of both colour and black and white sketches. no great detail but good enough to present a general idea.
2,Good Techno-Thriller but Theme Frightening!,"The action and suspense are excellent...keep you hooked. The theme concerns a conflict between the Navies of the US and India. I had always felt India is the kind of country that doesn't go out looking for trouble and also that India and Bangladesh are, well, friendly. But the author actually describes the Indian military using nuclear weapons on neighboring Bangladesh which I found very disturbing. Some events such as the escape from Rhode Island and a single, crippled US warship taking on an entire Indian CBG by itself seem to be a little out of class for this class of novel."
3,Not the worst book I ever read,"Although realism is not Ms (or is it Mr?) Mobley's strong suite, I enjoyed most of this book. The plot really started to fall apart in the end, but the first half was as good as anything Clancy has done LATELY, without too much technical jargon.The end ... well, it was pretty weak. Still, it was sort of interesting to see all the loose ends tied up.Call me crazy, but Code of Conflict, if you aren't too picky about details, isn't bad reading. I have read several WEB Griffin which weren't half as entertaining."
3,OK but editorially flawed,"This is an adequate example of its genre, although some of the situations are a bit far-fetched. The book is, however, made almost unreadable by terrible quality control. It is perfectly clear that the only close look taken at the proofs was by an automated spell checker! This dismaying tendency ( correctly spelled problems with tense, homonyms, etc) is seen more and more often these days. Whatever happened to competent proofreading? The publisher should be thoroughly ashamed!"
1,"Very Disappointing, terrible editing","I enjoyed the other books by this author but this one falls far short of expectations. The middle of the book slowed to a snail's pace with page after page of wordy, endless soul-searching by the characters. The action finally picked up in the last 50 pages but ended up not being worth the effort.The editing was awful! Incorrect words, incorrect tense, plurals instead of singulars and vice versa.After forcing myself to finish this book while flying, I left it on the plane. It was not worth carrying it back home."
1,The book is really pathetic,"The techno/war thriller seems like the internet craze - too many people with bad ideas and poorer knowledge jumping onto the bandwagon.Book is technically flawed, badly edited and geo-political nonsense. Save your money and buy a Big Mac instead - its more ful""filling"".PC"
1,"LACKS OF LOGIC, REALISM AND KNOWLEDGE","The book is poorly return and clearly exhibit the lack of Authors knowledge and logic about the region in question. One of the Major country Involved Bangladesh is wrongly refereed as Bangal (a state within India) and Bangali. The book is usual portrayal of mighty good forces fighting against unprofessional, foolish villain. The novel goes against the logic of current world order."
3,Broad but Shallow,The book gives a broad but shallow libertarian perspective on current events. I would have liked to have seen more historic context. On the plus side the book is well written and organized.
2,The title is misleading ~~,There are very few Buddhist chants on this CD ~~ it is mostly vocal/choir singing and not what I would call music for meditation. Not even very relaxing. Disappointing.
1,A CD the Buddha wouldn't have been proud of..,"I felt that first of all the songs were WAY TOO LONG.I felt like I was just sitting there waiting for a song to end.Like another reviewer,there weren't any chants really:just chorus music you couldn't make out clearly.I would've liked to see a lot more variety in the instruments they use, as well as the mantras they chant.I highly recommend this CD though for anyone who's bored and just wants to go to sleep."
4,2 good movies for one HOT PRICE!!!,"These movies are both solid movies that are finally available together for a great bargain. While I do prefer the original because the fight scenes in the 2nd one were blurry at times and hard to see what was going on, they are both solid movies.The first is about the mystery of Jason Bourne, a man who was once a contract killer who is confused who he is. The movie packs lots of action, suspense and a whopper of an ending. (That was quite unrealistic but was still cool)The sequel is about Jason Bourne who is trying to live a normal relaxing life until he's framed for murder. And, now he's go to settle the score and set things right.They're both good movies and for the price, it's worth it to see the action and suspense."
4,Good For Lonely Nights...,"After reading the other nay-saying reviews I have to get my 2 cents in. I found this video to be quite stimulating, and it has rarely disappointed me when I've needed some company. Admittedly, I have a favorite section, however, to me, IT'S WORTH THE PRICE OF THE VIDEO!!"
2,A premise in search of a plot,"Lies and Alibis feels like a premise in search of a plot: Steve Coogan's an ex-con man who's spotted a gap in the market and now provides alibis for cheating husbands and wives only to find himself in the frame for murder when one of his clients accidentally kills a woman. With a similar plot engine to Coogan's earlier The Parole Officer - man suspected of a crime he didn't commit has to use his clients to save him - it's the kind of US film Peter Sellers might have made during the early 70s lull in his career and which you'd expect to see on an airplane. But while it highlights Coogan's weaknesses as a conventional leading man and is very short on laughs without have a smart enough payoff to compensate, it's brisk and harmless enough. But James Brolin really should lay off the Peter Falk impersonations in future."
2,A lot of money for a little gain.,"By its nature (a text book) this is very boring. Although boring, the material is presented quite well. However, the text won't be of much help unless you have a good economics professor to help you out with some of the material. I don't know why I bought this book, we never used it in class. This book isn't the best source from which to learn economics. A live person can probably help you learn more, and it may well be cheaper than this overpriced book."
5,Epiphone Junior,Guitar is a super value . The quality of the instrument iswonderful for the price. It met my expectai tions. Was delivered promptly. Its my daughters first electric and the lighter weight is perfect.
5,Barbies play football too!,"Looking for someone to challenge this Yasmin at football?BARBIES CAN PLAY SPORTS TOO!If you want proof, go to:http://www.epinions.com/content_6506516100"
4,old songs,After listening to an oldie station I heard an old favorite and wanted my own copy by the original artist. thank you
2,"UNEVEN ATTEMPT TO BE ""DIFFERENT"" JUST FEELS LIKE A JUMBLE","I hate to admit it, but after all the anticipation I found the new CD disappointing. There are definitely highlights, especially the new version of ""Quittin' Time."" But it seems to me that Chapin couldn't decide whether to do an album of live tracks, lesser-known songs or copies of her older hits -- so instead she did a little of each. That just makes the collection come off as schizophrenic. Amid the interesting new material, the familiar versions of songs like ""Passionate Kisses"" and ""He Thinks He'll Keep Her"" feel flat and boring, without any particular reason to be on the album. I applaud Chapin's desire to do a ""different"" sort of greatest hits album, but I wish she'd been consistent in giving her fans material they don't already own or hear on the radio every day."
1,"overated as an artist, and this is the proof","This compilation won't win over the sceptics. She may be a ""media darling"", and has her fans for sure, but her abilities are quite pedestrian. So little here is noteworthy that it is hard to know where to start, but the ""live"" tracks are a misnomer. If she has any strenghts, it is in the studio with her very strong band. As a solo performer, I doubt that she could keep an audience's attention in a venue larger than a coffeehouse for more than three songs. She obviously does something for some people, but try as I might, I just can't see what all the media hype is about. I wouldn't be surprised if deep down, she actually felt the same way."
5,FANTASTIC! WELL WORTH THE WAIT.,"As always, MCC gives her fans her very best. I loved the new renditions of ""Quitting Time"" and ""Can't Take Love for Granted"". I had never heard ""10,000 Miles"" in it's entirety and it moved me to tears.Mary Chapin-Carpenter continues to produce material that stands on it's own two feet, high above the other stuff that is currently passing for music."
2,"Good for starters, bad if you have all the CDs already!","You know, I bought this CD hoping to complete my Mary Chapin Carpenter collection. But, I've taken it out of my carrying case to make room for bigger and better CDs.It's great to have this CD if you just started listening to her music (in order to decide if you want to risk buying the rest of her stuff). Otherwise, it is just a dust collector. The live versions of her songs (albeit the ""Can't Take Love for Granted"" live version) are just terrible. Her new songs also lack the hometown feeling of her first few albums.I might be a bit harsh, but I think this ""box set without the box"" was a poorly packaged product."
3,curious,"I am looking for an up tempo song that was not on the soundtrack. It is a techno, driving style song. If anyone can tell me who it is by, I would greatly appreciate it. Part of the lyrics go ""...I've got two more minutes and I'm gonna cut to what you need...so tell me is it time for your a__ to give, tell me...is time to get down on your ___ ____ knees..."""
4,Liked it,"Liked the CD. Only bought it for one song, but liked several other songs on the CD. I am happy with my purchase"
3,Sarah McLachlan song,"Funny to come here and find other's like me desperate to find out who did ""that song"". It's is so good and the thing is, I already own the CD the song is on, but apparently haven't listened to it in years and couldn't for the life of me remember who did it. So, thanks for the answer folks. But now, here's the kicker....is it really Sarah McLachlan doing that version of it ? To me it sounds a little like someone else doing her song. What say ye ?And FWIW, I live in the town where that final scene was filmed. Some pretty large fans going for the pre hurricane wind."
3,Balconey Song,"I've always thought that the song that's played at the end in the storm was ""As Baile"" by Enya."
2,Just pretend it's Beck.,"I would have given this song a 1, but at least this guy doesn't sound like Beck when he sings. Other than that, it sounds exactly like beck, from the trippy sound effects to the spoken dialogue. Try a little originality."
4,Have Case Will Travel,"Back when I was jamming with a Praise Band, this was very useful... but I digress, this was actually the case for my daughter's acoustic, not my electric bass."
3,Defective,I received this item in good time. The shipping was fast.The product was defective tho. Part of the vinyl was cut to small and caused the part of the material under it to show along the edge.The overall quality of the build was good for the price range of the case.
5,Great case!,"Excellent value and good quality hard shell case. It is perfectly designed for Les Paul model, it can handle the weight and the guitar is secured inside and well protected. This is the best option to travel on planes."
3,Standard cheap tambourine,"I was a little bit disappointed with this tambourine. I was doing thumb rolls with it quite nicely at first, but after just a few times the head must have absorbed moisture and will no longer play well. I wouldn't recommend using it for anything professional, but if you just need a standard tambourine and the classic tambourine noise, then you should be happy with this."
5,Incomparable,"I'll try to be brief. This is surely the most balanced point-and-counterpoint book to date, about forensic archaeology and the Shroud of Turin. Scientifically, nothing else I have seen comes close."
4,Nice Tape,"This tape is indeed very relaxing. It works especially well right before bedtime. The routine is about 30 minutes long. She talks too much a few times, leaving the student just standing there and also doesn't cue you out of a pose (when you are turned away from the TV) a couple times. But, all in all, I am enjoying it."
5,Soaring!,My prayers and meditations soar when I play this music. The beauty of it amazing. You can tell that the chanters are really praying this music. I highly recommend it.
5,mt y review,"This book is great, not only did it clearify my perticular issues but it gave me very specific solutions. I will be reading it again and take it to my doctor to help solve the problem of androgen disorders in perticular high testosterone levels. very easily undersood book. highly reco,emd it."
1,This is so sad for anyone considering adoption,"Selling adoption to infertile people with the idea that you can ""obtain"" a baby in less than a year is so misleading. It just saddens me."
1,This is a dog ... Not erotica just bad porn ...,"The book is the memoir of Joshephine as a girl of about 6 to 7 years old as she is not so slow, or gently for that matter into a life of sex.There is no realy story and the description of the seduction scenes are really lacking. The seduction scenes are generally Josephine being the agressor and after the first ten or so I decided that I had it. Normally even though I do not really like a book I will finsh it to be able to really give an honest review, but this one .... I really couldnt take it...."
2,Puka Roach,This may be the worst album ever realeased by a major recording artist. And to think that I saw these guys in mid 2005 and thought they were good. This album just plain old stinks and should not be purchased by anyone. I think I'll go put on a John Denver CD and relax for the night...
2,alright,I only liked 3 songs on this album and that was tracks 1 2 and 6 the rest was okay. So this was an okay CD and those three songs are the best songs on this album.
4,"""My heart is a fist drenched in blood.""","I don't think Papa Roach is that good, but they're really not bad either. I've never been that critical of rock as long as it's entertaining to listen to and has some catchy hooks, which Paramour Sessions does. The band has long since steered away from rap and is now pretty standard hard rock. Nothing they do is really extraordinary, but they're quite capable of radio-friendly noise.The single ""...To Be Loved"" is a pretty solid fast-paced jam. ""The World Around You"" has a nice guitar line in the verse and a hard chorus. ""Forever"" is one of the band's better slower songs, and is matched with an anthemic refrain. ""Time Is Running Out"" kind of sounds like a pop punk song, and is fun to listen to. ""My Heart Is a Fist"" is one of the more hardcore songs on the album, and ""Roses On My Grave"" is a departure with a string section, and is a nice way to end it."
4,Papa Roach - Paramour Sessions,Has 2 awesome songs Alive & Crash!Great album but not so awesome than old PRoach albums!
3,Not Bad,This album isn't so bad. I just bought it cuz I buy EVERY No Limit album! It'd be good for playing at basketball games and rallys. Check it out!
2,One of the worst decisions I have ever made...,"This CD is quite possibly the worst No Limit cd ever made! Next to other talentless rappers as Full Blooded, etc. The best tracks on here were the last couple, they were just instrumentals of P's earlier song, called B-Ball. There were no lyrix in there and i was happy. I also listen to a few other tracks, the ones with Big Ed, Mac and Servon, as well as Reginelli and Pheno of Gambino Family, because they are all pretty lyrically talented, but the subject matter--of making an entire album dedicated to basketball, especially since Master P was dropped from Charlotte was a bad move. Don't sellout No Limit."
5,Still among the most serious deep thinking about tax policy,"The famed economist F.A. Hayek called this ""a highly important essay,"" but that was a vast understatement. Written by two University of Chicago law professors, the book is suprisingly philosophical yet also practical. A clear and persuasive debunking of all the arguments used to defend taxing the next $100 of income at different (marginal) rates depending on how much you've already earned. Only 104 pages of text, albeit in smallish print, it still packs a lot of punch in a small package."
4,Norpro Spatula,"Functional, well made and inexpensive. A little too flexible for me but still does the job. Works well on non-stick surfaces as well as baking pans and cookie sheets."
1,this album is so horrible!,this is probaly the worst album that has ever been released.this guy is so wack he makes vinillia ice look like buckshot!f--k white dawg this guy is a f--kin wigger who is ruining it for all the white mc's with talent out there.people don't let this bulls--t a-- album fool you there are good white mc's out there so just ignore this piece of s--t album and pretend that it never existed like 99.5 percent of the people out there.
5,It's goody-good.,"This is the best CD I've gotten in a few years. It's got humorous lyrics in many songs, but there are also a couple of tear-jerkers(""Restless"" and ""I Just Wanna Get High""). Out of the 20 tracks, about 18 are great. It's great to listen to at any time. If you like rap, and aren't offended by extreme use of explicit lyrics, I would highly recommend this CD."
1,Worked at first - then turned into junk,"Bought two of these energizer batteries for my Panasonic 5.8 phones several months back. They seemed to work at first but over time became junk. They now only hold a charge for 10 to 30 minutes maximum. I always let my phones drain completely before recharging them; unfortunately this did not keep the battery life strong. In my opinion, since I bought two, I believe these are low quality batteries that are not worth buying. I am replacing them with another brand - the type with the neon green label - not sure what brand they are but I bought one to test and it seems to work fine."
4,Lovin Liston,The first track is a symphonic delusion of aural bliss...I highly recommend it for any Jazz fan...particularly within this genre.
4,"Good blender, but it's LOUD","This blender is a good powerful blender that makes great smoothies in seconds. However, I did have to deduct one star because of the noise level. It so loud that it makes my 2 and 4 yr old son and daughter nervous when I run it. Thankfully I only have to run it for a few seconds because it blends so quickly."
4,Brainstorm - 'Second Smile' (Garden Of Delights),"Coming to you from Baden-Baden, Germany, this is a reissue of the band's second of two lp's. Originally released in 1973.Brainstorm's main player is Roland Schaeffer, who plays sax, bass and guitar. Schaeffer later joined up with Guru Guru and is back with them currently. Brainstorm combines progressive, jazz and experimental along with bits of Zappa-like weirdness and the Canterbury sound. Jo Koinzer's superb flute playing is quite noticeable on ""Herbst"" and ""Affenzahn"". Enno Dernov's keyboard work is also impressive on ""There Was A Time..."". Also liked the groove laden ""Marilyn Monroe"" and the band's rare single 7' single ""You're The One"" that's tagged on as a bonus track. Nice, IF you like this genre."
1,Weather and History Lesson,"If you enjoy being tied to a chair as the television flickers between The History Channel and The Weather Channel, then THIS is the CD for you. HUGE Lewis Black fan. However, this is unquestionably his worst performance, and makes me wonder why this piece is in stores. I HIGHLY REGARD AND RECCOMEND ""The White Album."" Black's, not the Beattles'.Also, it seemed that the second-half of the album was written by political lobbyist. I can and will laugh at ANYTHING as long as it's funny (i.e. yes, I'd laugh at an old lady falling hard on the ground if she bounced just right) but this CD has NOT been played after my initial listening.If you really hate your mother-in-law, THIS is THE gift for her. REWARD YOURSELF with ""The White Album"""
2,Cheap junk,It is good for only throw away stuff. I would not put serious work here. For me a bunch of Nexxtech CD/DVD had errrors reading and writing them.Next time I will look for quality brands for media.ST.
1,Left in the Dark,"The picture of the lamp showed a white colored shade, with what I believed were beads. I instead received a orthopedic shade of beige with no beads. I was totally disappointed but did not want to take the time and effort to return the lamp. I just didn't want to think about it, anymore. The gold painting on parts of the stand make it look cheap,as well."
5,A must have book for the beginner Jazzer...,"What are all those beautiful sounding chords? How do you play them and how to they work with one and other? This book puts it all together for the beginner. Chord charts could be clearer with frets numbered, but all-in-all this is an easy to read and understand basic jazz book."
5,sick of being literate to only power chords? Learn some jazz,What I've found most distracting about being a modern guitar player is that tablature robs the student of learning music theory and immediately applying it to making music rather than 2 bar riffs alone. Buy this book and retranscribe your tab downloads into real music..
4,Still jazzy after all these years,"I bought both volumes of Jazz Guitar right around the time I entered college, about a half century ago. At the time these were among the very very few instructional books available to teach yourself jazz guitar, and they were far beyond the scope of my beginner's chops. But I have kept going back to them over the years, and am coming to get a little more from their study each time.Mickey Baker is, I believe, the Mickey of Mickey & Sylvia, a rock 'n' roll duet who had a novelty hit in the late 50s/early 60s called ""Love Is Strange:"" she sang, he picked guitar, they both talked.For a relic from way before the Information Age, Jazz Guitar 1&2 have a wealth of information, pithily (if at times somewhat idiosyncratically) presented. Check 'em out."
5,Re-review for lamp,I got the replacement globes from a very concerned seller and was very pleased with his attention to followup. It is a winner.
3,Pink Earrings,These look a little more clunkier than expected and the pink glass looks more like plastic.
2,Smart Media is a poor choice,"an ""ok"" camera with a good lens but crummy memory type. It needs used Compact Flash memory cards. Smart Media is much smaller in capacity (128mb vs over 1000mb). This is a very important consideration when looking at any camera which produces such large image files. Smart Media isn't very smart. Since unlike Compact Flash it has no onboard controller. (meaning fatal error happen much more often). Transfer speed is much slower. How long do you wish to wait between shots? The slower the memory card, the longer the wait. And including a measly 16mb memory stick is a JOKE. It can hold 4-5 raw images. Also in a camera costing this much, rechargable batteries and a charger should be standard (and for most other cameras it is)."
4,"Olympus C-2040Z, ok, but","Nice camera, good resolution; only comes with a 16 mb card which I promptly replaced with a 64 mb card: why pay for 3 megapixels then not use them? I also have the Olympus E-10. Huge difference in ease of use and in price. The viewfinder on the 3040 is poor, on the E-10 super. Zoom is greater on the E-10, which, I believe also has image stabilization. The E-10 is a pro-level camera and weighs like one; the 3040 is a compact that barely weighs anything. that's why i have both. For serious photo excursions, I'll take both; for bopping around and the opportunistic photo I use the 3040."
5,I love this camera,"I have had the 3040 for about 6 months now, and am very pleased. I find it easy to use and it takes fantastic pictures. I am not an experienced photographer, but am finding the size and versatility of this camera to be great. I am glad I did not buy a point-and-shoot. While the 3040 is as easy to use as a point-and-shoot, the ability to add lenses and external flash will allow it to grow with me. My only complaint is that many of the features are buried in the 2nd and 3rd levels of a menu, making them less convenient to access."
4,NOT FOR BEGINNERS,"I am definetly not in the expert catagory, for photography and probably shouldn't have move up to this camera, from the easier to use, kodaks so soon,especially three days before my family reuion. I can comprehend pretty well, so by the time I studied the manual, and figured out what I needed, to get good quality shots, the family reunion was over. My first lesson was to go out and purchase the inexpensive, card transfer device. After I downloaded my pictures I discovered that they were to dark, and software adjustments made them look poor. I figured that I might need and external flash attachment, to avoid fumbling through the controls,at busy times, and that an additional zoom lens wouldn't hurt. My zoom pictures really suffered for light even though I used the enternal flash. I can use some additional tutoring. I Welcome!"
3,Gandalg wig Word of Caution about the mustache,The wig is a good buy when it need for a variety of other thing like a long beard for easter and christmas . A word of warning the mustache of this product will never be shape as shown in the advertisement.
5,Amos Elon KNOWS,"A blood-dimmed time is a fine and worthwhile book. Amos Elon is an intellectual in the midst of the war zone. Though his book ends before this current war, he is always lucid, always eloquent and full of insights from Jerusalem."
1,Breathe Breathe Breathe,"The cueing in this video is absolutely terrible. Moira offers absolutely no direction, as if the only word she knows is ""breathe, breathe, breathe."" Damn it, I get it... BREATHE! She literally says ""move this here, pull it up, move that over and breathe."" ARE YOU SERIOUS WOMAN?! I shouldn't have to look at the TV to know what in the world you're talking about. She NEVER says, ""we're going to stretch the hamstrings or the quads"" or ""stretch to the point of tightness"". Just you guessed it ... ""breathe."" I also found Moira and her long freakish toes irritating in general. Breathe, breathe, breathe... it goes on and on. The disk is rather short, which initially attracted me, but for the quality of instruction.... buy something else. Literally anybody with video camera can do one of these videos... this terrible workout is proof. And remember ... BREATHE."
3,Conditioner and Detangler,I think the straight silicone works a little better but this is a great detangler for our Cocker Spaniel. Coat is shiney.
1,I cant get past the awful smell!!!,"I purchased this because most of the reviews were good. The smell is awful and it doesn't matter how good or not good it might be when I can't get past the horrible smell, it is time to find a different spray conditioner for my two dogs after their bath. I can't say that I have notice it doing anything but smelling awful so I would highly suggest to not purchase it and find something that smells better."
3,College reading,"I was sent this book to read for the honors program at my college, and in my opinion, it is a far cry from the ""masterpiece"" that the Sunday Times hails it as. Parts have beautiful wording and imagery, but on the whole this book is a long, slow, and pitiful read. Alliteration is used far too often, and thus bogs down the already scattered story line. Unless it is required reading, I don't suggest this book unless you are most fascinated by the history of the upstarts of automobiles in the US and abroad."
4,This set is a perfect set for someone starting a new kitchen,I have been using this set for 2 months now.It works great and the pots and pans are perfect sizes.However this set doesnt work that well when we put it in the dish washer.The copper bottom is getting black spots when i run the dishwasher.But it heats very fast and the food cooks fast.I just love this set.The glass lids work great tooand not to forget i got it for $20 at amazon!!!!!!!!!!
5,*the* place to start for jazz improv,"I had read the previous version of this book over a decade ago, and this book is a huge step forward. If I had had this version back then, I probably would've been much better at jazz improv today. The only downside of this book is the information architecture (e.g. page layout); it's a bit arcane, but it's charming I guess, like that disorganized folder of important papers your music teacher might have given you when you were starting out. Content-wise, this book is filled with jazz improv gems. A must-have."
5,Excellent for areas where you don't have much room to work,"There is not much that can be said about a Oil Drain Pan.What I like about this one is it's shape. I use it for small engines and the shape helps me get it in to smaller areas. If I were to drain the oil from a car or truck I'd want one with a much larger drain area. This one is excellent for riding mowers, tillers, and etc.I bought this as a replacement for one that had disappeared from my garage. I already knew it was small but that was what I liked about it. I have a large drain pan for cars and trucks but it don't work well for tight spaces when draining small engines. I spill far less oil with this one.It's a sturdy product that should last many years."
2,Not what I was expecting....,"This is not the book I was expecting... I know the author try her best, but I found that this book have very few names for each letter, in fact I found out more french names in other book than in this one, and the title foucuses on French names.....I'm a bit dissapointed. The cover it's great but the lack on information is wat I regret...Certainly, in my opinion it is not worth it's value, in fact, I'll try to return it, it is not what I was expecting."
5,2nd copy,"I love this album so much that I didn't mind paying a second time so as to replace my lost first cd. This has been making me laugh since it came out. I got my first copy before seeing Bobcat do the same material live. Listened to it repeatedly, and still loved the live show!"
3,Cancelled order,"I cancelled the order, but the seller was nice to return my payment, and the overall experience with the seller was good. But regardless, its a good book to read as it gives a lot of predictions into the future trends in HR and OD and how a good HR person should work around them."
3,"great concept, could be sturdier","I purchased this hoping to make potty training for my 2 year old a little easier. He really loved the freedom to get up on the potty with very little help, however, the Freedom Trainer is a little flimsy, so if your little one is afraid of wobbly items, this one may not be right for you. Please bear in mind my 2 year old is a big boy, 37 inches tall and 35 pounds. The Freedom Trainer fit my commode just fine but the seat has to be in the up position, it slides around if you just place in on top of the seat adding to the wobbly effect mentioned earlier. My only real complaint is that the ""bolt and nut"" system used to put the Freedom Trainer together is also made of plastic and one of them broke while tightening up the seat rendering it unusable. I am going to try to replace it with a regular bolt and nut, just haven't had the time and we are using this in an extra bathroom so it hasn't taken priority in the fix'it department."
2,Don't recommend this item,"I would absolutely not recommend this particular potty ladder to anyone.I had seen one similar to it and was quite disappointed with the one I ordered.It's back in the box waiting for my next yard sale, or I may take it to the Salvation Army.Guess I should just take the trouble to return it.Thanks for asking.Carol TribblePinckney, MI"
4,GRANDMA'S PRAYER ANSWERED,"The potty chair is a blessing; affordable, easy to store, easy on granny, no fuss, no muss and allows the independance my toddler aspires to when she visits. In fact, her 1st, unsolicited, potty experience was w/this chair; not the one at my son's home or at her other granny...they have the ""kiddie potties""; the type u have to clean up, ugh! My only complaint is the platform of the step. It's not wide enough for her to safely turn around once she reaches the seat,(akward, she's 18 mos & slim) soooo, Big Mama's there to assist w/the turn, from that point on it's as easy as A,B,C. Good Luck!"
3,"Great concept, poor quality.","I love the idea of this product, no mess to clean up and space saving. However, the product quality was very poor. It did not feel sturdy at all, and the little 'non-slip' rubber pieces on the bottom of the legs kept falling off. We gave up on using this product for potty-training because my son did not feel comfortable sitting on it and I was tired of replacing the little non-slip pieces."
5,Great Book,"I bought this book for my daughter to read because I thought she could benefit from it, And I was right. This is GREAT reading, the only thing I was disappointed with was that ending, it ending so quickly and now I have to wait till April for the next book. Great Job Leathel.~Angie~"
5,Anybody that loves vampires has to read this book!,"This book is so awesome, it catches a vampire as a powerful strong being, unlike other books that can bore you easily. Anyone who loves exiting nonstop action should read this Book, you wont be let down."
2,Lacks substance,"The humor that was promised never came to fruition. The characters are not believable for the era and setting. Joshilyn Jackson writes as if she were the angry voice of her main character. She attempts to portray the actions of the characters as humorous, but instead they come across as classless boors with no respect for others or themselves. If I were not from the South and didn't know better, I would have a low opinion of Southerners. Jackson uses the same typical unimaginative descriptions that have been used for eons to describe Southern culture. The whole tone of this book is crude and insulting. Thankfully it is a quick read (translation:short) and doesn't take much intelligence on the reader's part. Rating: R for language and content."
3,Bookclub Pick,"Our bookclub picked Gods In Alabama. First, not my type of book but the many reviews had me anxiously rushing through our last book to get to this one. One of the reviews said a mix of Steel Magnolias and Sweet Home Alabama - I didn't get that from this book.If I rated on humor alone it would get five stars. The author is great with one liners. However, the story drug in many spots. I am looking forward to discussing the book simply because of the one catch within the story - can a rapist also be a good person?It may make a good Lifetime movie - maybe with Taye Diggs as Burr."
1,Sad and boring,"To describe this book, one must use words like:trite, banal, commonplace, corny, dull, hackneyed, hokey, horrible, stale, uninspired, unoriginal, vapid, appalling, awful, heinous, lousy, lurid, horrid and terrible.Poor plot, flat characters and out and out bad writing. It did however make fine kindling on a cold night!"
2,Too Much Time and Space for One Little Book,"Covering 2500 years and a fair chunk of real estate in 40 pages, this volume of the normally quite nice Osprey Military books is only recomendable for the Angus McBride art. It concentrates on the better known states, when the limited size would have done well for a study some of the lesser known states and left the Egyptians, Hittites, Assyrians and such for their own volumes. However, it does have a nice integrated timeline, and the aforementioned wonderful Angus McBride art."
5,A Christmas Wish,"This looked like it might be a good classic Christmas movie to watch during the holiday season. I have not had a chance to view the movie to rate it, but I have given the seller a five star rating for their prompt service and delivery."
1,IT WAS AWFUL!!,this book is hardly worth reading. the main character is soooo fake. i couldnt bare reading past the 3rd chaptr. i hope none of u are unfortunate enogh 2 hav 2 read this book
2,drdickens,"This story does not make sense either on a literal or symbolic level. The narrative is crude and forced. The theme is vague. The writing has a few good moments but is generally flat. One has the impression that Moore didn't know what to do with the situation after he set it up. He plowed forward into a series of unbelievable scenes until there was no way out. In the end, he chose the easy way out."
4,Stuff,"Tony Maloney, a history professor, on vacation in Carmel, CA, goes to sleep in a motel, has a dream about attending the Great Expedition in London in 1851, and when he wakes up, a magnificent collection of Victoriana is set up on display in the parking lot. A dream come true at first, but eventually the collection begins to take control of his life, and there is nothing he can do to get rid of it - not even dream another dream! He ends up committing suicide.It's an interesting idea and Moore's broad humor is on display here. But it's pretty much a single idea and often while reading it, thought it might have worked better as a short story. Good, but Moore has done better work in other books."
4,Works with Palm Treo 700W,"I bought this in order to plug standard earbuds into a Palm Treo 700W smartphone, and it works great. I load music onto an SD card using Windows Media Player, and this adapter lets me plug a pair of Griffin Earthumps in and get at least 6 hours of MP3 player functionality. If you have a Treo, buy this and the Earthumps through Amazon, and you have a portable MP3 player to travel with, including the phones, the adapter, and a nice pouch to hold them, for about $10.00. Don't be fooled by the low price on the Griffin buds either - they work great for $25 (what I paid at the airport) so I'm sure they sound even better when you only pay $6.49 through Amazon!"
1,Did not work,"Did not work with my LG phone. I'd hoped to use this adaptor on the ear phone plug on my phone, to plug it into my sound system. Alas, it does not make proper connections."
5,Exactly what you need to plug headphones into a cell phone,"If you have a small 2.5 mm outlet on your cell phone and you want to plug in headphones, get this little adapter."
4,It works!,I bought this adapter for my teenage son right after he received a hoodie for Christmas with built in headphones. It connected the headphones with his phone perfectly. I don't know if it's washable yet but I'm sure we'll soon find out. We give it 4 stars and possibly 5 if the washing machine doesn't damage it. Everyone should consider this item if needed.
1,Didn't work out.,This item came quickly and that was much appreciated but the my need wasn't met with it. I needed it for a pair of stereo headphones to be connected to an Xbox controller. It just wasn't a snug enough fit and continued to become loose rendering the item useless.
1,Ghastly audio! MUST TO AVOID.,"The video elements are just fine on this set but the audio is catastrophic. There is a disclaimer at the beginning of each disc babbling about ""poorly preserved"" elements. These kinescopes are very well preserved, it's the audio remastering that sucks, and this set should have been recalled. It is difficult to understand dialogue through the distortion. Abominable!"
2,somewhat disappointing,I know I had written a good review for this before but that's because i had just spent a lot of money on it and i was telling myself it was good. The band sounds like background music as you hear the audience louder and like another reviewer said it sounds like Geddy is singing with a pillow over his face.
2,"Sound is Terrible, Rush say it isn't so!","I'm deaf in one ear so at first I thought it was just something people could hear in Stereo that I could not, until my all-ears friend listened to it, and said it sounded like a horrible bootleg someone attempted with one of those old tape players you buy at Radio shack.It was just horrible, too much base, I tried to lower the base, change the treble, play with the EQ, no luck, still crappy god awful sound. The first poster was spot on the money, I'm just re-affirming that this is by far the worst Rush live album I've ever heard.I'm sadly disappointed with Rush on this, they were the ones that signed off on this project, if a partially deaf guy can point out how awful the sound is, I have to ask, did Rush even LISTEN to this album?Okay to be fair here, what's good about the album.. the art work is pretty, the set list is arranged well, the CD's are nice and round with no jagged edges, other than that there are far better live albums out there."
3,The sound leaves much to be desired,"When I used to hear Rush live, both in video and albums, it was always an impressive sound usually better that the studio recordings, the details of the instruments were perfect.Rush in Rio has fallen into the standard Live Audio Sound. The concert itself met Rush standards but the sound ... it just not your usual RUSH LIVE SOUND. I can't say more."
1,Who left that EQ alone? AWFUL!!!,"To enjoy this album, you will ABSOLUTELY NEED a 31+ band EQ on your stereo. It will sound HORRIBLE and very WASHED OUT on most ""PC speakers"" and in most standard car audio systems.I'm assuming that Alex and their engineer Jimbo did the best they could with the live sound they had... but since Jimbo is credited with the recording part, it seems like he had significant hearing loss by the end of the tour.It sounds like the whole thing was bootlegged from a little Panasonic cassette deck back in the 50th row at the concert.TERRIBLE and not worthy of the ""Anthem"" label. Even the FIRST RUSH ALBUM had better EQ!Do yourself a favor. Find someone with a great deck who's got a very good EQ and a CD recorder, and run each of the CD's through it to fix the EQ, then use your copied CD's for general playing.Rush should definitely recall this album and replace our discs with better mixes. Utterly disgusting."
1,What's next?,"First we get Vapor Trails, which probably has the worst sound quality of any studio album on the planet, then we get Rush in Rio, which is probably the worst sounding live album on the planet.With this trend, what exactly do we have to look forward to?"
3,Rush in Rio CD,Just wrote a review for the Rio DVD. The cd sounds just as bad or worse than the DVD. It's a real let down. I have been a fan of Rush for most of my life and still am. I hope these guy's will RE MIX AND THAN RE MASTER BOTH THE CD AND THE DVD. The sound mix doe's not do this great band justice...
3,Even I could have mixed it beter,"Rush is still a great band, and if the crowd noise on the DVD were lower, this live performance would have risen to the top of my list, which is still headed by a couple of Dream Theater performances. I don't know who wanted the crowd this loud in the final mix, but they obviously move in cheap pop-music circles and have absolutely no idea of how to mix virtuoso performances (compare with Dream Theater Live in Tokyo, for example)."
5,Miracles do happen here and there,"To me ""Exit... Stage left"" was longtime winner of live performances. It is great joy, to find band making it once again so many years after. Sensitive ear can complain about sound misqualities, but wasn't that, what differed from studio recordings for ages? And wasn't the atmosphere of the live event always to cover these troubles plentifully? So does it once again. And since this record is doubled by DVD with Dolby 5.1 for sound lovers, there is no reason to complain. For audio-record collectors, this show is just another great achievement. Thanks, the band! Frankly, we did not expect that much was possible!"
3,Mountie prevents Indian trouble,Mountie (Tyrone Power)goes to indian villege to save captured white girl and retrieve bank robber(Robert Horton). Power is aided in his quest by half-breed(Thomas Gomez)and must challenge a proud indian warrior(Cameron Mitchell.
3,Power : - Always good to look at!,Not the best of a Tyrone Power 'epic' but enjoyable just the same. The mountain locations are magnificent as is the man himself! I enjoyed it very much as it brought back many happy memories.
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!I LOVE LEO,"This was a great book!!If you love Leo then you MUST get this book!!I love him soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much and this book gave me a lot of good info that I didn't know And I thought I knew everything about this HOT babe!!!Plus it had really hot pics of the hotest guy alive! Get this book. I love you, Leo"
4,Get well-known of DiCaprio,"This is a excellent book about Leonardo, better than all the others. It includes many nice pictures of him ( the cover is great ), and interviews that let you know what he thinks, his thought and ideas. No matter you're his fans or not, if you want to know more about the actor who is going to be the hottest in Hollywood, Jack in Titanic, buy this book."
3,Good,I'm taking my dog to a trainer and this had a couple of things that he has not taught me. So it is a cute video and if you want your dog to learn tricks it's great.
3,Excellent Turbo,"We ordered this turbo, to replace a similar one we gave to our daughter. This Turbo is way quieter than the one we gave away, we were not sure it was working. A few minutes after we turned it off the glass cooking bowl shattered. We returned the Turbo, and the replacement arrived and is working great!! Amazon was so easy to deal with on the return, they have made me a loyal customer. I recommend this Turbo to anyone who likes fast Cooking.July 2010: the oven was great until a month ago when it just stopped working, the fan runs but it will not get hot, at least it waited until we had our friends over to visit before it died...The reviews for this oven are shifting quickly from positive to not so good...and of course it has been almost 2 years so there is nothing to be done except pitch it and figure out what brand to replace it with.."
5,Great Item,"Far less exspensive then the TV advertised products (flave-o-wave, far better quality construction. Easy to clean and cooks wonderful meats of any kinds. A great replacement for using the stove + tender meats. Great for a husband who's weary of cooking."
5,super cooker,"The Aroma Turbo Oven is one of the best appliances I have ever used. I had a similar one for six years. It is easy to use, easy to clean and best of all it is a healthy way to prepare food. I can't understand why more people don't use it. It saves on electricity and it is fast. I wouldn't be without one."
2,Not so good warrenty,"I got the product as stated by seller. They did great job.The cooker handle broke the second time I used it. I called manufacrurer and they didn't offer to fix, but instead shipped the part with no instructions on how to replace. Two hours of taking parts off and looking finally got fixed. Hope it doesn't break again. I'll trash it. NO INSTRUCTIONS!FOR information, handle has cotter keys keeping it in the head. You can't just pull it out. Nut on fan is left handed! One screw is missing that holds pan on."
5,At last...,This is probably the best anime i have ever seen.I almost have every episode in French and i'm looking forward to see them in English.Long Live Saint Seiya!!!
4,Bitter-sweet Love Story & Rags-to-Riches Tale,"I always love historical fiction, especially of this period. (17th Century England.) Life was really hard then. But in this novel, Nell Gwynn, born in the lowly slums of London, finds herself first the leading comedic actress of her day and then the beloved mistress of King Charles II. This book is a good sequel to Philippa Gregory's novels about the Tudors. ""The Perfect Royal Mistress"" met the greatest test of all for me: I cried at the end! Read it! You'll cry too."
1,"Skip this ridiculous farce, and read ""Forever Amber"" instead","This amateurishly-written, poorly-researched novel is an insult to historical fiction, and certainly doesn't even begin to do justice to ""pretty, witty Nell."" If the leaden dialogue and shallow characterizations don't turn you off, perhaps the absolute lack of storytelling ability will. The author appears to have forgotten the ""show, don't tell"" rule of writing, and frankly I am amazed that this was published at all ... evidently there are much lower standards for historical romance than for other types of fiction. My writers' group would have torn the first chapter to shreds in five seconds flat."
5,Perfect Royal Read,"I read THE RUBY RING when it came out and wasn't that impressed with the depth of the characters or even the plot of Hager's first novel. However, I thought I'd give her books another try and I'm really glad I did. The Perfect Royal Mistress is a huge step above her previous work, and the story of King Charles II and his mistress Nell reads like some of the best historical fiction around. The pair of them drive this tale of jealousy, love and politics, and anyone who's a fan of English history will enjoy this romp through Charles's life, complete with affairs, mistresses, and illegitimate children!"
5,A panical masterpiece,I thoroughly enjoyed hearing the new panic album. JB's voice is right on along with the rest of the clan. I couldn't have asked for a better selection of songs with such a crystal sound. It is a must have.
5,Widespread just keeps getting better.,Widespread has one of their tightest sounds on this album. 'The Waker' is already a favorite of mine. Iv'e been listening to Widespread for seven years and they never cease to chill me!
5,This album Jams like no other!!!!!!!!,This album really jams. X-mas Katie rocks and so does the Waker and all of the rest of the album. This album is a must to add to any collection. Even if your not a Spreadhead.
4,VERY Impressed!,"WOW! That's really all I can say about this album. I've been an R.E.M. Fan since '91. I've heard a lot of things about Widedpread Panic, but never sat down, and listened to one of their Albums. I'm SO glad I finally did! And, that I started with this one. It really is amazing! It's very refreshing to hear some ""Real, Good"" Music for a change! I don't bother with the radio, or pay attention to who's at the top of the Billboard charts. It doesn't even begin to compare to this! (The same goes for R.E.M) I'm pretty picky when it comes to music. There aren't very many Albums that I can listen to, without skipping a song or 2. This one is pure perfection! I'm going to be listening to this thing for a good, long while. Until I decide to get more of their stuff."
5,Not just for e-business managers,"As a software developer who develops websites, since reading this book, there have been many times I've sat in a meeting wishing everyone else around me had read it as well. While reading it, I found myself nodding in agreement with much of what Bergeron says. Technical people and management as well as web designers should read this book (not to mention anyone who's in business at all, whether you consider yourself an e-tailer or not). There's a lot of insight that goes beyond web technology that should be useful to anybody.The material is presented with humor and ease such that you feel like you're having a conversation with the author. Beware that if you don't read this book, it's possible that your competition might have read it and could already be implementing some of its suggestions."
3,"This sounds okay, but it has very little information with it.","This CD was a quick release in 2000 to go along with the popularity of the TV show ""The Sopranos"". The main disappointment with it is the lack of discography in the liner notes. There at least could have been the release dates listed for all the songs."
4,Worthwhile Book to Read for College Freshmen,"Pat O'Brien came to speak to my graduating senior class this year about the reality of college and how to make the best of it. I think it was a good thing to put the end in perspective first and make goals for yourself in order to make your path towards success even more efficient. His Winning Characteristics are not always easy to accomplish, but with discipline and hard work anyone can achieve them. Basic tips on studying, getting to know professors, extracurricular activites, and internships are helpful in envisioning your undergraduate years as challenging, but exciting experiences. Overall, O'Brien offers sufficient and real information that every college freshmen should know, and if he or she utilizes O'Briens advice they will be much more likely to be successful."
2,Bring back the rock and roll,"OK, perhaps I'm in the minority here, but I'm one of those Soul Junkies that digs the lo-fi rock and roll stuff but doesnt really care for the hip hop beats. 1952, 53, and 55 rock, and I even like 56 a lot, but 57 and 58 lost me. The 1942 EP kicked my butt with Good as Dead, and thats exactly the kind of music I want to hear more of from Glenn and the gang. 1958 is just a jumbled mess of noise and nonsense. If that's your thing cool. For me, I miss the super spiritual rock and roll."
3,"Great for Beginners, Not Good for Advanced","First, I agree that this is a great, if not fantastic, self-prep book for someone who can't afford a class or is just starting. The chapters are broken down by question type, everything is clearly explained, there are plenty of examples and the drills and practice problems help to illustrate the concepts.HOWEVER....I bought this book for the same reason I bought the Games Bible: I was looking for more info before the test. I've already taken a prep course, twice, and I've done over 400 hours of studying for this test. I wanted to perfect my skills and walk in with 100% confidence come test day. Although I enjoyed this review, there were very few nuggets of helpful/new info that I found. That said, the practice book (which is sold separately) was great for review and freshening up old concepts.OVERALL...It's a great book but I'm not sure how much value one will find in it if one is already advanced (or I guess scoring in the low-mid 160s)."
5,Essential Prep Material,"The ""LSAT Logical Reasoning Bible"" offers an excellent explanation of the logical reasoning portion of the LSAT. This book offers detailed instructions on how to address each major type of LR question. The rules from this book are essential to answering the questions correctly and in a timely manner.Reading the book is not enough. You must know it by heart. I made an outline of the book two weeks before the test to make sure I memorized all of the rules. Starting with the LR Bible, and continuing to use it throughout my LSAT prep, notably improved my LSAT score."
5,Excellent Intro to Structures of this kind of thinking,"The book is an easy to follow guideline into the Logical Reasoning type of thinking that is used for the LSAT testing for future lawyers in this country.The book was purchased most economically, through Amazon.com."
1,Music??????,People this aint music this is rock GARBAGE. If you like this kind if CRAP you seriously need some kind of mental help. THIS KIND OF MUSIC IS PURE CRAP
4,A Satisfying Nail-Biter!,"""Diane Thiberge has just 48 hours, not a minute more."" THE STONE COUNCIL starts off fast, and gets faster and more complex as things go along. Inexplicable things start happening, and people start dying.I loved it. The plot revolves around a 30 year old ethologist who specializies in the study of predatory animals. This knowledge serves her well as we unravel the mysteries of who this killer is, why they are killing, why they kill in the creepy ways that they kill, and finally how Diane came to be in the middle of this story. Unraveling all that leads us to explore telepathy, psychokinesis and how the Soviet state funded research in these areas. In the process, we see Diane come to know herself.THE STONE COUNCIL delivers everything you want in a thriller, down to the surprise revelation at the end that brings all the disparate plot elements together at last."
4,Perfect!,I needed 2 of these so I can keep a dozen boiled and a dozen eggs in my fridge. I like that I can turn them sideways in order to have more space in my refrigerator.
3,To domesticate a pig of a hero...,"I read the Conquest first and really enjoyed it so I decided that I had to read the prequel, the Taming. From the comments I have read by other people it was just what I expected. The hero is a real pig and really needed domesticating as well as taming! He's not my type of hero at all. How could he rape his bride (to avoid an annulment of the marriage) and then spend his honeymoon nights with other women, leaving his new bride alone. I really couldn't see why Liana was attracted to him. As for discovering that Rogan already had millions of offspring (from his ""Days"") running around the village, I found that a right turn off. I preferred the Conquest but feel that the Peregrines are filled with too much hatred."
3,Fun to read!,"I was bored this past weekend and happened to see this on my bookcase ~~ and naturally, since I love reading Deveraux's books ~~ I picked this one up. And again, she carries me away! This one is no different from her other books ~~ and I love her books when set in medival times!This one is of Liana, a wealthy Neville heiress who has been courted ~~ for her dowry, not for herself. Rogan is a Peregine, bitter about the Howards who are feuding with them all this time ~~ and never takes notice of Liana after their wedding. Determined to get Rogan to fall in love with her, Liana made his home and life so comfortable that he couldn't resist her.This one rated a three just because the last few chapters felt like the author was rushing through to get to the end. I hate being rushed ~~ especially by stories like this! But all in all ~~ I love this book and love how Deveraux has always managed to carry me away!10-24-05"
1,so dissapointing!,"I read so many good reviews a was so excited to read this book. The Hero was disgusting! I could not get over all the filth in this book. The constant mentioning of the hero never bathing killed all the love scenes, especially considering the hero was covered in body lice for most of the book. The Hero also sounde very ignorant for most of the book. I wish I wiouldn't have wasted my money."
5,You will like this one,"I was very worried at first when I began to read about all the filth and lice. I couldn't understand where Jude was going with this one. Who in there right mind could be attracted to a person who is so grose and doesn't care about himself. But I stuck to the plot and couldn't put the book down. Happy endings, with funny surprises."
5,Great educational bird toy,Great little stuffed bird that makes the turkey sound. One of our son's PreK teachers collects them for her classroom and we were happy to contribute this addition.
3,Thanksgiving turkey,This would look good in a thanksgiving display. The sound button doesnt work just right. It has a brown tail with white trim. The head and neck consist of light blue and orange and pink and tan. The body is dark gray with wings that are black and white striped. Some black furry stuff in front. Bottom and sides black and black ring on tail.
2,Amaryllis,"I found this novel to be very lacking as a science fiction/ romance. I think that it is truly one of the worst books that I have ever read. As a romance novel I thought that it moved along to fast. One minute they were having an agrument, the next minute they were practically sleeping with each other. As a science fiction novel it was absolutely horrible. Ms. Castle did not take enough time to talk about the plot or defined it as it needed to be. Frankly, if I hadn't read a book worse than this recently this book would be getting a one."
3,Original Concept - But don't expect much else,"There are a lot of original and interesting concepts in this book. The idea of people with a psychic ability that need a complimentary psychic to channel their talent is fascinating. Too bad the characters and plot in this book are not. Riddled with attempts at clever dialog that mostly fall flat, a hero that talks to the heroine like she is a not too bright child, and a half-baked mystery this book plods along unevenly. There are many drawn out scenes full of repetitous dialog that do nothing to advance the plot, or entertain the reader. Still the book is readable and parts do sizzle, but not one of the better futuristics I've read."
4,A Great Book,"This is an excellent book. Fascinating. A nice combination of Romance, Mystery, and the Psychic. Read It!"
2,This will soon be an old version,"Right after I ordered this product, I learned that Microsoft will soon release a major upgrade for it. I called Microsoft and they were not able to tell me that I will receive this update when it comes out. It appears that after spending almost $500 for this version, I would have to spend an additional $500 to receive the next upgrade. I returned the product and decided to wait for the Visual Studio 2005 upgrade."
1,Not as good as it looks,The size said 12.....more like a size 6I was not able to wear it to the Halloween Party.Money wasted!
2,More like a size 8-10,"This Costume is ADORABLE, but definitely NOT a size 12-14. It is way too small, more like a size 8-10.Unfortunately it is impossible to find it bigger."
2,"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me!","Once again, I have purchased 1/2 of a season for a full season price because I mistakenly interpreted the word chapter to mean season. Dumb me."
2,Not Very Good,"I think the originals in japanese of real emotion and 1000 words were much better. I don't really like Jade's voice. It seems too sharp. Also, the recording sounds kind of low quality. Even though I don't understand the japanese version, I prefer the japanese version over this english version."
2,wired,"this cd, is basically have some japanese music turned english. my responses, its okay ecept for the fact that since im japanese i more use to japanese language for tese music. i personally think the english songs on this album are hard to listen to, too soft and overall not japanesey ""not a word"" but basically stick to japanese when making japanese music and i speaking to avex, or sweetbox jade couod've made her own song instead of ruin a nice japanese song. the piano song is really great and to you was also, and if you are going to buy advent children i reccomend you import it because english ruin the characters voice, and teh characters are japanese so why change their voice to english, did they go to english skool."
4,It is one of the good book that I could find about coaching,"I am trying to find some relevant sources about coaching. At the end I felt that I am getting closer to this concept. Giving some basic ideas about how to behaive as a coach and then giving some ideas about the structure of coaching. If you are intersted to become a coach, yes you should read this one."
1,Try this...,I liked going to the IAC website & MindTools website and getting most of this info. for free!
5,Co-Active Coaching 2nd Edition,"THis book was very insightful, informative and interactive. The author's have made an amazing contribution to the world of coaching. The shipment service was excellent!"
2,Far From His Best!,"If you got Island Life, All The Way, When Night Calls and In My Wildest Dreams you'll be disappointed by Orlando Ablaze. Live, with alternately overpowering drums and keyboards I coulkd hardly recognize this as a Ken Navarro album at first. Had I been able to listen to clips from the album on Amazon I would not have bought this one."
4,great lil hight value knife..,"i just picked up this knife at our past gun and knife show for ten bucks! But even for 20 bucks this is a good knife.. It has like the g10 scales on it soo naturally it runs a little heavy but it is pillar design which is nice.. overall, good knife by taylor made(smith wesson), these knives by them are usually hit or miss.. and this one is def. a hit.. pick one up you wont be disapointed..j"
1,"very lame,puts you to sleep","Another great musician,that thinks we want to see and hear an accoustic set.I wanted a DVD of a concert band but got an egotistical,{I'm great by myself,its me they love},load of self indulgence.I've seen him ""live"" twice,and own all his cd's,but this DVD is a waste of his time and my money.The DVD is not clearly advertised as an accoustic set,so don't waste your money."
4,Enjoyed Mr. Walker's singing but a little disappointed in CD,"Clint Walker has a lovely, mellifluous voice and I enjoy hearing his singing. The musical choices reflect his abilities well. However, I didn't realize that a few of the songs would be done by a women's chorus rather than Mr. Walker. The songs are lovely and well done, but it's such a treat to hear a strong, manly voice in song, that hearing the chorus disappointed me. I thought that he had made an album of ballads years ago, but I can't find any information about it. On this album, ""With These Hands"" was my favorite, but my twelve-year-old daughter prefers ""My Kind of Country."" It would be great to see a collection of his songs from ""Cheyenne"" and his various movies also."
5,Fantistic hybrid of 2d gaming and 3d graphics!!!!11one,"Viewtiful Joe has to be one of the best if not the best 2d games I have personally ever played. It achieves the hand drawn look using the new technique of cell shading. Not only does it look bueatiful but it plays like a dream. I have heard people having problems with slowdown and frame rate drops on the playstation 2 version, but I haven't noticed any problem. Be wary, this game is one tough cookie, even on easy."
5,Henshin A Go Go Baby!,"When Clover Studios was still around, they produced some awesome action games like Viewtiful Joe. It's a classic and if you've never played it, I highly recommend it. Got here in great condition and quite fast!"
2,I want to return this. It's too small,They have not responded to my email about sending this back. Both are too small
4,Well worth it,"My son is about to complete first grade at a prestigious private school. The sections on History, Geography, Literature, Arts and Music are for more extensive - and engaging - than what he has been exposed to at school. The content and style were well suited to his age."
3,Good Overview,"Great springboard book to help if you're a homeschooler or trying to supplement your child outside of the classroom.Language and Literature: Plenty of stories and poetry to read to your child and get them started. Weak in the phonics area. I would recommend a good phonics primer - Phonics Pathways by Dolories Hiskes (awesome and inexpensive resource and it will get your child reading fast).Mathematics: Simple progression in math skills. I like the suggestions on manipulatives and games to do with your child, they make the learning process more fun for the child.Science: Braod overview of many sciences. Good things to start talking about with your child before a trip to the local zoo or library to pick up more in depth information.This book is not meant to be a complete curriculum for teaching your child, but is a nice supplement. I like the stories, poems and music. It's a great portable all in one book. The notes to parents are helpful in finding ways to teach each subject."
1,Not Very Interesting,"We have had several of the Kumon workbooks over the years and they have always been fun and exciting for our children to work through the problems. This one just has the same 2 puzzle types (color the correct number, dot-to-dot) all the way through and none of my children were interested for very long."
5,Excellent!!,Phyllis Trible brought the plight of these ancient women to heart breaking life with her examination of the text through the eyes of the mostly voiceless victims in scripture.
2,"For Men, as Adam, who eat what she brings to them.","A work typical of God's curse upon Eve (Genesis 3:16b) and her progeny as the emerging church movement moves, in Sovereign Decree, toward 2 Thessalonians 2:7,8 & 9."
3,"A nice Story, but...","I have recommended Ms. Whetstone work to all of my friends. I love her work in Tumbling and Tempest Rising. I couldn't wait until I got my hands on Blues Dancing. I enjoyed the story, but it just didn't get my attention like the first one. The first two books were page turners for me this one was just a lil' slower. I was very glad that Verna Mae found what she needed all along... Ms. Whetstone is still one of my ""A-List"" authors."
1,Blue and Sad Narrative,"This book had very depressing undertones. Even when the characters are supposed to be happy, they feel sad. I don't get it?The characters personalities were not fleshed-out enough. Certain characters I could never really understand who they were, and how they fit into the overall scheme of the story.There are too many holes in this book. Since the author jumped from the 70's to the 90's she should have done a better job of filling in the gaps.Someone gave me this book, and I am very glad. I would have been very upset if I had actually shelled out money for this story.I do not recommend this dull and boring book to anyone. And, I will never read another story by Diane McKinney-Whetstone. An author gets only ""1"" chance to impress me. First impressions, are the lasting impressions. And, this particular author has left a bad impression on me with her ambiguous story that does not lead to a sensible ending."
5,Diane does it again! Blues Dancing is supreme!,"If you haven't read this one yet...what are you waiting for? Diane McKinney-Whetsone has a way of placing you in the center of the story, along the line of the characters, that locks you into their joys, fears, desires, and their strengths. Blues Dancing hits the heart of many of us who have ever needed to change our lives around, and needed the right inspiration to do it. Verdi Mae is forced to reach out of her shell of un-assurance to go for what's best in her life. She suddenly leave the familiar for the unfamiliar and takes the chance on love, love that one wrapped her in a sheet of fear, anxiety, and emotional trauma. Taking the hand of her true love [Johnson], she finds her self worth again! Once you read it, don't put it down, seeing this book through to the end will bring about certainty in your own life."
2,Wisdom of the Ages,"One major correction Dr. Dyer need to do is that Siddhartha Gautama later know as Buddha was born in Lumbini, Nepal. He was *not* born in India as he states. If an author gets this kind of fact wrong, who writes with a second hand knowledge of a major religious/spirtitual figure could be very well discredited. What if some author starts saying and writing that Jesus was born in Syria or Jordan? There is no dispute/controversy regarding Buddha's birth place. He was born in Lumbini, Nepal."
5,Reaching or Dumbing Down?,"I question Gail Hudson's suggestion of Dyer dumbing down. Reaching a large audience is worth praising. While some might prefer his more elevated writing, there are those of us who value message over form."
1,THIS CD SUCKS!!!!!!!,"The movie Blade was Kick-Ass and action packed, but the soundtrack sucks with the exception of New Order. What happened to all of the Techno and Rave!!"
3,Producer's mistake,"Roger Sanchez was very unhappy in his attempt to put hip-hop and techno/rave in the same project. Hip-hop is cool, but it has nothing to do with the movies' mood, expecially its soundtrack. If one buys this CD, one expects to get techno and rave, not hip-hop. But I think it's worth the money because of the last four tracks. Go get it!!!"
3,More Techno...Please!,"As exciting as the rock/rap fusion (or techno/rap in this case)can be for music fans like me, most discs I've obtained have disappointed me over the years. The movie ""Blade"" initially drew me in with it's hard-hitting techno beat, but the soundtrack only manages to whet the appetite rather than living up to itsgreat potential. The track ""Confusion"" is the main reason to get your mitts on the CD, but the remaining rap tracks only cause fans to wear out the ""skip"" key on their CD players. A worthwhile effort, sure, but it only made me want to listen to better collections, like the ""Judgement Night"" soundtrack, or the satisfying ""Saint"" soundtrack. True fans of the techno or rap genres know what they like, and this probably won't be it."
2,Do your self a favor...,If you like the club scene and Track 12. Go buy the Cd single and take this one back to the store. Why support this drivel when you can get your money to the artist and support their music.There is too much good music to pay for 50% of a bad disk.
1,WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?,"The movie was pretty crummy, but I loved the techno music. So i bought this, and it's crap. The techno music is good, but what is this rap crap? If I would have known this was rap, I wouldn't have bought this."
2,lost songs,"i bought this CD just for track 12, confusion (which alone is good enough to buy this cd), but i've been looking for that song frost listens to on his headphones during his encounter with dragonetti in the library. it sounded like a very cool track."
3,Blade were did the rap come from,So you what to get this soundtrack well you better think about how much you like techno cause it has more rap then anything. But the techno tracks are hard to find and they are some good ones at that. If you know some one who has the cd dub the last tracks other then that if you buy it you love techno a lot.
1,WANT TECHNO....NOT MUCH HERE!!!!!!,"THE MOVIE WAS THE BOMB THE SOUNDTRACK IS A BOMB! GREAT TECHNO TUNES ALL THROUGH-OUT THE MOVIE AND THE FIRST HALF OF THE ALBUM IS RAP. WAS THA DILLY YO? THE BEST TUNE ON HERE IS THE REMIX OF NEW ORDERS CONFUSION! WICH IF YOU DON'T WANNA SUFFER THROUGH THIS HORRIFIC ALBUM CAN BE FOUND ON THE IMPORT ""THE (REST OF) NEW ORDER"". IF YOU LIKE TECHNO PLEASE TRY SOMETHING ELSE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!"
2,Very Disappointed,"I bought this album, after seeing the movie, expecting a descent techno album. BUT NO! It's mostly RAP! (YUCK) with very few songs from the movie actually on it. Then I actually read the cover, ""inspired by the movie"" oh well. I was really hoping to get Bang Wa Cherry singing ""Chin Chin"".. no it's not Shonen Knife!! ...."
3,i bot the dvd to find the songs,"rent or buy the dvd to find the songs in the credits......japanese bar scene...shonen knife..""ah singapore"".....Photek...""ni ten ichi ryu""....source direct...""call & response""...and a band called soltaire does..""Eclipse,Soleil,Fearless""...chk out the dvd, to find what u lookin for....."
3,The issue of Soundtracks-,"There are 4 types of Movie Soundtracks: Original Score, Film Music, Show Tunes, Cast Recordings. This soundtrack would fit into the Film Music category, however the reason this is a concern is that within this category lies the subcategory of music ""inspired by"" the movie. Much of this soundtrack is comprised of music inspired by the movie. For those looking for the great techno appearing during the movie, you will be disappointed with much of this soundtrack, with the exception of a few good tracks at the end. Upon reading the interesting thoughts by Soulson (above) the true state of the soundtrack is exposed, the producers wanted to make a soundtrack filled with rap songs about the movie which they thought would lead to more money in their pockets. DJ Krush is great and the Roger S. and Soulson collaboration are phenomenal."
2,Not what I thought it would be.,I listened to the samples and I am disappointed in all of the rap. I loved the techno dance music and this is the only cd I've wanted to buy for a while but I think I will pass after seeing the reviews and listening to the available songs.
4,Tight Collection,I dug Certain songs from Albums from Pac.this is no exception How Do U want it is tight Jam as is California Love with Dre&Roger.those cuts are Bumping.2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted with Snoop was okay at the time&still is at that level.Hit'Em Up is Funny.Ego&Arrogance.but the music on all the cuts were cool.
3,Lots of dinosaurs in a small package.,This was purchased for a family we sponsored for christmas so sadly I really didn't get to play with them much. The dinosaurs were very detailed. The zipbin was a little on the cheap feeling side. But you do get what you pay for.
1,No Call Back!,They sent me the wrong product. I can't get them to call me (or Email) me back. Don't buy anything frm Cheap-CD's!
5,MegaMan Equals MegaFun!,"I've read manga before, and it was pretty good, but MegaMan: NT Warrior had me rolling on the floor with its humor and jumping up and down like a crazed chipmunk with its action. The cartoon version doesn't do the manga justice, though it comes extremely close. I greatly recommend this read!"
2,A big disappointment,"I have been a big fan of the b-tribe for the past 9 years. CDs like Sensual Sensual, Suave Suave, Fiesta Fatal, and Spiritual Spiritual are the best in the Spanish/New Age genre that have ever been made by anybody. This CD seems to be a try by the group into Jazz/New Age genre. They should stay with what they know best. This CD was certainly a big disappointment."
3,A little light on action shots,"The book is a decent personal perspective on this era in motor racing history, and some of the shots are quite candid. My only complaint is that there are a lot of still shots; cars and drivers sitting around the paddock. Could have used a lot more photos of cars at speed."
1,Eeh....,"I apologize to the fans and creators of this program, but it can grow rather infuriating and hokey for me. Although normally I am the sort of person who enjoys humor relating to small children, the jokes of that subject featured in ""Full House"" are boring and cheesy, I hate to admit. Usually, such humor overestimates the typical dislikes and fears of young children in laughable fashions as though something unspeakable is being brought up. In many series this can be funny, but in ""Full House"" it just is not. It is a typical, unrealistic, corny situation comedy featuring impossible, odd situations that are always handled by the end of the episode."
4,Not sure what I think.,"I have fond memories of Full House, but I have to admit that I found it a little silly this time around. I would highly recommend it for younger people, but I guess I have gotten too old (60) to really enjoy it anymore. Funny, but I still like watching Family Matters. Go figure."
4,"House Too Full, No Need for DVD...now.","Let me start off by saying I love Full House. I grew up with it since it first started and I was a small baby. But is there really a need for this show to be released on DVD right now? I mean why would anyone buy it when it's on basically every channel at ALL times? I can think of at least two channels off the top of my head now that play the show constantly and Nick @ Nite is one of them. It's on pretty much as a marathon all week long. I say wait a while when the reruns are a little more scarce and THEN release it as more people will be interested in it.And to all those who are rating this review as not helpful, screw your bias opinions. I'm stating the truth."
4,My least favorite season of my favorite show,"Full House Season 1 is good, but out of all 8 seasons, it's my least favorite. It might be the absence of Becky, Jesse's long hair, or that Michelle can't talk. And also it has a lot of boring episodes.Favorite of Season 1: The Big Three-O, DJ Tanner's Day Off, Our Very First Show & Night, Sistely Love, and the Miracle of Thanksgiving."
5,Full House-The Complete First Season,I Grew Up Watching Full House And It Was Good Watching It Again On Dvd For The First Time And It Was Also Good Watching The Cast Grow And Change With The Series Again As It Went On Over The Years.
3,"Persuasive, but not very detailed","I found Hazlitt's arguments to be persuasive, but not supported by a lot of empirical analysis. I expected Hazlitt, who is an economist, to cite more empirical studies. But overall I enjoyed reading the book. It moves quickly and is not filled with academic jargon."
3,"Looks cool, but too small.","I ordered this thing just for fun, but I gave it to a friend for a graduation gift because it wasn't what I was looking for.Pros: Looks okay, price was fair.Cons: DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE PICTURE, smaller than the real prop, feels kinda cheap.If your looking for something to make a costume than this will do. But any self respecting pirate would try and find a better one. After all everyone knows the fake ones won't turn you into a skeleton at nigh, duh."
4,Finally the voice of Penelope is heard,"I was drawn to this book by my love of Greek mythology. I was interested in the retelling of the Odysseus myth from the female perspective of the faithful Penelope and the twelve maids.I thoroughly enjoyed this and read it in one sitting. The voice of Penelope was believable and i loved her take on her family background and the rumours, tales and stories that revolve around her, Odysseus and her cousin Helen (another very well realised character). The only reason for scoring this as 4 out of 5 is that, although I am used to the convention of the chorus in Greek mythology, the multimedia aspect of this chorus just didn't really work for me.All in all though I would definitely recommend this book. I have been meaning to try some of Margaret Atwood's writing for some time and feel that this was an excellent introduction. I will definitely be reading more."
1,Cotton candy & styrofoam,"I can't believe all the positive reviews of this book! Is this a case of no one wanting to say that the Empress has no clothes on?I love Margaret Atwood, and have read just about all of her books. This resembles NONE of them. It is cotton candy and fluff! It's written in a comic book style that is supposed to pass for wit, I guess. I'm scratching my head and wondering why she bothered with this book at all. Maybe she needed some quick cash?"
3,"Great concept, but","Giving Penelope a voice is an excellent concept. Margaret Atwood's book, part of the Canongate Myth Series, illustrates the trials and tribulations that Penelope goes through as she waits for the return of her husband, Odysseus, from the Trojan War.I would argue that there is too much telling rather than showing in the book. Penelope, speaking from the land of the dead, tells us her story. If we could have seen more of her interaction with her suitors, her maids, Odyssues and their son Telemachus, I think we would have a greater appreciation for and understanding of her plight.This is the second of the Canongate Myth books that I've read following Weight. I love the concept of the series, but was looking for more from both books.I'd bump this review up to 3.5 stars if I could."
4,"Not what I had hoped for, but still worth the reading","I should have read the reviews about this book. I was expecting a more serious treatment of the telling of the Odysseus myth from Penelope's viewpoint. That could be worthwhile, I think. So I was initially surprised that Ms. Atwood was giving me a light-hearted romp through the halls of Hades, but once I got over the initial shock, I got a lot of laughs out of it, so I'm giving it 4 stars. No 5 stars because I thought there were a few times that the author was taking the easy approach to humor by using some modern slang and/or referring to modern fixtures and gizmos. Perhaps a few efforts to get a laugh were a little overdone. But do buy it or borrow it from the library. It's short, a quick read and a showpiece for Atwood's renowned wit, and if you say you never got some chuckles out of it, I won't quite believe you. The chorus of the hanged maidens is delightful. Just be realistic in your expectations, which I obviously wasn't."
5,The Best!!,"Gil Mantera's Party Dream is one of the best dance/rock bands ever. From start to finish this album is packed with nonstop tracks that just leave you speechless. Not to mention they are one of the best live bands. Some of my favorite tracks are: Shadow Grip, Elmo's Wish, Building Rockets, and Emotion Road. Support your indy music scene and buy this cd now!"
2,Nothing Special At All,"Most people probably bought this CD thinking that the content would be that of the song ""Crush"". Unfortunately, this album is a huge disappointment. The songs all sound the same--they are all written by the same person, Andy Goldmark, or co-written by Jennifer Paige and Andy Goldmark. They are all slow and the tunes are the same. The only good songs are ""Crush"", ""Somewhere, Someday"", and the remix of ""Always You"", because they have a beat to them. The worst song, by far, however, is ""Let it Rain"". So, in conclusion, if you are looking for an album w/ the beat of ""Crush"" you will be sorely disappointed."
5,Sweet pop music from a sweet lookin' girl,"I think I have a crush on her. And so does my friend Mark Eaton, of Chatham, Ontario."
5,Every Song is GREAT (unlike most albums you buy),"I thought Crush is a nice song and Jennifer has a great voice but I was totally impressed when I heard the other songs on the album. For most albums I buy, it always turns out that 3 or 4 out of the songs are great and the rest are kind of like ""fillers"". NOT THIS ONE. You go, girl!"
5,Hot hot hot!,"This is one simmering album for fans of the 70's horn rock sound -- my personal favorite from BS&T. Though most of the tunes are cover songs, the arrangements are what make the album great. The horns are blowing like crazy (with an especially insane trumpet solo on Lucretia MacEvil), David Clayton Thomas is screaming, guitars are wailing... well, you get the idea."
3,only black and white photos,only really bad thing ....is all the pictures inside are black and white.color pictures would have been goodlike one mushroom was. yellow and red. but in picture it was only black and white
3,Common Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms of the Northeast,Great information but I was disappointed that the photos were in black and white. I had to order another book so I could see the colors of the mushrooms I was finding. The book was a good resource for comparison with a book with color photos.
2,horrible ending,"Since there was nothing on TV that caught my attention & I like to watch horror movies I put this movie on, wish I didn't. I suffered through the poor acting in order to see the end. Perhaps I wasn't paying much attention but the ending sucked! Who did the murders? I don;t like movies that leave you without an end. As I said, maybe I wasn't paying much attention to it & just before this movie I watched another, won't mention the name, which had an ending but the acting was horrible too."
5,Nice to use,"I allready owned this Bar-B-Que and enjoyed it, so I bought one for my daughter and son-in-law for Christmas. It has done a good job for me, we use it at least 3 times a week even in the winter time."
5,AWESOME!,I think that Maggie and the Ferocious Beast: The Big Carrot is an adorable and creative book My whole family loves it. It is one of cutest books I have read and my little sister adores it she reads it every night. The best part of the book is the illustrations...so bright!
4,Crank it up!,This is Johnny Winter's at his rock & roll best. Classic songs with an all star lineup. Half of the McCoys (Hang On Sloopy) are with him. A must for your collection!
2,AND saves it,"Johnny Winter never quite understood rock and roll and in the late 70's he ditched it altogether for blues.Derringer,Hobbs and Caldwell on the other hand knew what rock was all about and it is them during the Rock Medley that stirs the crowd upDespite the hype this album isn't all it's cracked up to be.Pass"
3,So-so,"At six tracks and just under forty minutes, this is one pretty short CD, but it does include an 11-minute B.B. King cover, and a 9-minute ""Mean Town Blues"", and it is from the LP-age, so I suppose that part can be excused.If you prefer Johnny Winter's most ""Old-time-rock-n-roll"" styled albums, you'll probably love this, but if you are looking for samples of his bluesier and/or more musically diverse material, there isn't that much here to get excited about.The up-tempo ""Good Morning Little School Girl"" is quite good, and Winter's renditions of ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" and ""It's My Own Fault"" are excellent, but the rest is predictable, generic and sometimes slightly hysterical rock n' roll (""Long Tall Sally"", ""Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On"" etc.), and a mediocre ""Mean Town Blues"" which belies its title.Some really good stuff, including a lot of fine guitar playing, but too many mediocrities for ""Johnny Winter And"" to deserve a better than average rating."
5,"Classic, blistering recording","Gotta disagree with the Stamford review.The energy and sheer axe virtuousity of this record surpasses anything else JW ever did. You'll never tire of it. The hyperpaced R+R is great but the blues cuts are probably even better.As far as studio records, the one that preceded this was pretty mediocre - Still Alive and Well is far better.I saw Johnny about 5 years ago and he was still incredible. His later tour in this area was cancelled for health reasons so I hope he's OK - probably is since he's still putting out records. That Live in NYC record was far inferior to the '94 show I saw, though."
1,"waste of money, scratched discs!","I bought the first season from this seller and each disc had issues, it was really a waste of money. they back of the cd's were all scratched and no good, only being able to watch every other episode is REALLY not what i was looking for. shame on you for selling this crap."
2,Only for Amanda Pays,"Subterfuge is really bad, but the reason it's worth getting is because first it's ten dollars. But second, and most important of all is because Amanda Pays is in it.If your a fan of Amanda Pays then Subterfuge is worth it. Highlights are of Amanda Pays turning around a motorcycle while someone is driving the motorcycle with her on it. And, when Amanda Pays Suits up in a wet-suit at the end of the movie. That's it."
4,Great travel seat not FAA approved,"I bought this seat for a trip to Africa with my 3-1/2 year old. It is a great seat, well padded, and nice fold in cup holders. It is lightweight and you can get a soulder carry case for it. The only thing I wish is that it was FAA approved for use in an airplane seat."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY.,"IF I COULD MAKE MY DECISION AGAIN KNOWING WHAT I KNOW NOW, I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT SOMETHING DIFFERENT. THIS PRODUCT MIGHT BE FINE IF YOU CAN STAND UNDER YOUR CAR AND USE TWO HANDS. HOWEVER LAYING ON YOUR BACK IN YOUR YARD THIS PRODUCT SUCKS. IT IS NOT EASY TO USE ONE HANDED...I HAVE YET TO BE ABLE TO USE IT IN REMOVING A FILTER FROM A CAR YET. PLIERS HAS BEEN MY BEST TOOL TO USE. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET A GOOD PAIR OF OIL FILTER PLIERS, THEY WONT FAIL YOU."
5,A Great Comedy Thriller,"Great stuff as ever from Bill Fitzhugh. As well as the usual endearing characters, a fun plot that breezes along, and plenty of smiles, there's also tons of interesting stuff about classic rock and radio stations which had me reaching for my CD wish list. Bill Fitzhugh has a real knack for making even his not so nice characters likeable, and sometimes even loveable. Left me with a good feeling for days after I finished it. Can't wait for the follow up."
2,Not up to his usual,"Way too much radio techno talk...who cares about ""segues"" or what disk jockeys talk about in detail to play. Basic story okay but not nearly up to his prior books...especially Heart Seizure which was the best."
2,A 78rpm author spinning at 33.,"Bill Fitzhugh is one of those authors whose books always go to the top of my to-be-read pile. However, this one is disappointing in every way. While the characters are likeable enough, the plot is almost nonexistant. It meanders. In fact, the book doesn't really end. It just slows until the paper runs out. It is as if Mr. Fitzhugh had to write something, anything, to fulfill a contract. Perhaps it was just an excuse for him to let us all know that he is well versed in the radio business and that he can easily remember obscure music trivia.This book is so unlike his others, I am going to assume it's a one-off mistake and his next book will be back up to speed."
2,Average,Jamie Foxx's show got better over time.around season 2-3 I notice a stronger element kicking in between him&Garrett Morris.Comedy is truly hard to move at first&certain things weren't fully developed there yet within the show. but it had some moments.
4,Memorable,"Read in January 1992, this book contains great poems by Essex Hemphill, Marlon Riggs, Wrath, and Donald Woods. Perfectly fascinating, moving stories, too. I remembered Wrath's work best after all was said and done."
1,very cheaply made product,Well i got these thinking they would be better then the $70 ones i purchased at a P/X in my location and boy i was wrong these are no better then the cheap glasses at walmart in fact the ones at walmart are better cause at least the lens dont fall out they are by far the worst glasses i have ever purchased and will not buy from here again.now i will say the guy called me and he swore up and down that they are real nike glasses but i know nike dont make cheap stuff so i doubt these are i think they are a knock off that he got for cheap and is selling on here but just know that they will not make you happy when you get them in the mail and see for yourself how cheap they are well i hope this helps you all.
5,ZOEgirl will soon return,"Different Kind of Free is an amazing record and a huge step in the right direction for this band. They are set to release their new project very soon, and the word on the street is that it builds upon the rock flavor presented on Different Kind of Free. This was by far their best record to date... curiously, it seems that most female artists and groups end up going to more of a rock sound as they progress..."
4,"I hate to admit it, but...","I really liked this video. I hated their music when I was a teen. Too ""pop"". I preferred punk. Nevertheless, Abba's music was everywhere and although I didn't seek it out, it must have sunk in. When I watched the video, it really brought me back to an era and time-of-life I very much enjoyed. I even knew all the words!"
3,I love ABBA but..,"This video told a nice story, sort of like VH1's Behind the Music, but when it came to the music, the videos were talked over, clips were shown, and it was frustrating.."
1,The Fourth Floor and Other Short Stories,"I didn't like this collection of short stories. Some of the stories, in my opinion, were underdeveloped. Others were too long and quite tedious to read. The lack of editing, made reading this book laborious ... rather like grading a poorly written english assignment. I wouldn't recommend this book."
5,Love these pens,I love these pens. They are wonderful. They write very well and look beautiful. I highly recommend them to anyone who likes to color. The delivery of the item was very prompt. Wonderful service from the seller.
4,Excellent thougth process - helped me immensely,"Some of the concepts though simple are strikingly effective. I will continue the suggested process religiously, even though the pains have subdued."
2,Weak Book,"Compared to all of the other books about TMS by Sarno, Schubiner and Brady this book is the weakest and less helpful of all. It lacks clear guidelines and is not really helpful compared to the others."
5,Hilariously depressing,"Watching this film around members of the ""bombs 'n' Jesus"" crowd will inevitably start an argument and/or physical confrontation, thus putting you in the position of facing ""the learned corruption of learning"" up close. Which is (for me anyway) a sign that it's a good movie.Kudos to Albert Nerenburg."
3,A Fun Read,"Being a fan of West Virginia's native son, Jesco White, I was immediately intrigued when I saw this title in an antique/junk store. Even though only a portion of this behemoth of a book is dedicated to the Last Mountain Dancer, I found it an enjoyable read overall. Kinder's writing style is engaging and possesses a unique wit and pace that keeps the reader interested in some mundane occurrences during his sabbatical. Normally, I could care less about what an old redneck scholar is doing with a young beauty and her children, but Kinder makes it interesting. He also visits other parts of West Virginia lore to include Mothmen, the missing Sodder children (which I wish he'd covered more) and the area's rich coal mining legacy. While this book is very long, I never found my interest waning and Kinder takes the reader to many interesting nooks and crannies of his home state."
4,Happiness with the Spinners,"A must for serious Spinners fans. The second album contains hard to find songs of the 70's including the amazing "" Easy Come, Easy go ""."
3,Happiness.../8,This two-albums-on-one-CD has it's moments (Rubberband Man and I'm gonna get you stand out!) Three stars!!
3,"I think it's good, because it's really colorful.","They all go to the Boddy Mansion, and Mr. Boddy dies, because of...well, I won't tell the answer. I recommend this book highly."
3,Pre Kendergardeners,It serves it purpose of giving the me the lyrics to entertain a bus load of pre kindergardeners (4yr olds).
2,Propane Cylinder,The propane tank is great quality. Unfortunately I didn't shop around and paid way too much. You can buy the same tank with a meter on it at Sam's for $29.00 or Home Depot without the meter for $29.00.
3,"Good, bad, ugly","I have one of these that has died... I would consider replacing it with another, but I'm a bit gunshy. The machine has great features and excellent performance. But mine broke down several times before its untimely death. And the picture quality on recording was slightly mediocre. The machine DID stand up to a LOT of use (we recorded endless hours of soaps and Babylon 5). The on-screen menus were not as good as the could have been, but worked reliably. But here I am getting another machine... and I'm not sold on the picture quality of this unit. ::sigh:: It's probably perfect for most people. If you rent a movie or two a week, this is the unit for you."
5,Absolutely a life saver!,"I had to have major abdominal surgery and knew it would be difficult to lie flat afterwards, so I bought this pillow ahead of time. It was wonderful! It is firm, which I like, but others may find it to be a bit too firm. It really made it much easier for me to get in & out of bed as well as getting comfortable.Now I'm all healed up and I still use it for other things. It works great to sit comfortably and read or use the laptop in bed.I've also decided when I get my next head cold that I'll try sleeping with it. I tend to use extra pillows because it's hard to breath when my head is all congested. I have a feeling this pillow would be helpful.I'd absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a wedge pillow.For the record, mine is the 12"" x 24"" x 24""."
3,too hard,"I think this would be great if it were softer. I know that I would use it more.I bought it to use ar night, but its a bit too firm so I only use it to sit up in bed to read."
4,Helps me keep weight off my shoulders,I had shoulder pain. Now I don't. I sleep like a baby and it is great for watching TV in bed.
3,"Served the purpose, but a bit hard","Ordered this for my wife who needed to be elevated after hip surgery, but she found it to be a bit too uncomfortable because of how hard itwas. I tried it also and found it to be adequate, but certainly needs pillows added for softness."
1,FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY,"What garbage! I remember seeing this in a book store a few years ago and I read through some chapters. Please. I cannot believe that anyone with half a brain takes this stuff seriously. I do believe there are some genuine mediums out there, Sylvia Browne being a good one. But anyone who runs a psychic hotline (we all know how THOSE work!!) and says dead movie stars come to HIM for revelations has GOT to be a quack. Did he (or his ghostwriter, I should say) actually think for one minute anyone would believe this nonsense? I saw NO disclaimer on this book. PLEASE don't spend your dollars here. It's not even worth checking out to see how phoney it is."
2,Not for Commercial use,"I wanted a crepe pan that would hold up to alot of high temp. After 2 weeks of use it looked old. This is a terrific pan for home use, but not for commercial. We followed all instructions for cleaning. With alot of use it just can't handle high temps with a gas stove."
4,nobody's home,"Great tune!! It has breaks between the beats where all you hear is a person's ""answering machine"" who is having a very bad day. You hear one message then the beats come back, then repeats the process again. The song has kind of a laid back(but not too laid back) house beat with funky background noises. This is definently a record to check out!!Be sure to check out other Green Velvet songs"
4,Very compact,I bought this to have in the car and to take with us camping. It's got a lot in it and my husband is very pleased with the range of items included. It's extremely compact and well organized. I thought the price was a bit high but I guess you pay for the excellent organization and compactness. Definitely better than kits we've tried to assempble on our own in the past.
4,"Coulda, Shoulda, Woulda...Long Live Dee Dee","As many reviewers have stated, this is for Ramones Fans Only. If you are looking for stuff about the BAND, this ain't the place to look. If you are a Johnny Thunders fan, you will definitely wanna check this out.Personally, I REALLY like Dee Dee and find him to be a very engaging, if sad, character. His place in music history is secure, but to see him near the end of his life, a wreck, and with little to show for his years as a legend, is sorta upsetting for your average Ramones fan to see. You should pick up his autobiog. to read a little bit more about Dee Dee the PERSON as opposed to the RAMONE.He was a thoughtful and troubled man. Get this to learn more about HIM, not if you are looking for a Rockin' Good Time."
5,Shoes & Slippers,Beautiful photos of a wonderful collection of 18th & 19th century footwear. A terrific reference for anyone interested in either century.
2,Not Quite Satisfied,"I didn't get the impression that the author was absolutely convinced of the things he wrote about, such as his psychic ability. He seems convinced and then he doesn't. It made me question his gift. The writer comes across as a nice guy, but he is no writing genius. Unless one is really interested in all he has to say, the writing tends to get boring. Sorry."
3,Recomend this product,"This book was entertaining and gave insight into his mom's personality, which is what I was hoping for, so I was happy with it. He is very respectful of his Mom/mentor, who he admires very much. I found his view of home life and the teenage antic's fun to read. It was nice to get a guys point of view."
2,not that good,"I think this book was okay. There were some funny parts, and I have to say that I did grow to like and admire Chris. But all in all, I was dissapointed. It was boring and I am one of those reviewers that didn't like the style he wrote it in. He was repeatative, like when he mentioned a million times about his and his moms tempure. I would love to have a reading with him and would never question his abilities, but it just wasn't a really good book."
2,"Before Picasso was an artiste, he was an illustrator","Before Picasso was an artiste, he was an illustrator. He MASTERED the techniques of illustration before tackling the new, rare, and different, and thus gaining immortality as a great artiste. Why don't Indie fim makers master the techniques of moviemaking before they take on the pretensions of the filmmaker artiste? This film is tedious and tiresome, with characters that are flawed, at best, and (possibly) psychotic, at worst. Boring. Next?"
5,THE REAL DEAL! There's nothing like the original,This is the original 1980's serial. I used to watch these with my children as they were growing up. It is so good to see them again now the children are grown. They bring up so many good memories.
3,I would have really given it 2 1/2,"Okay... I heard Koontz's books were awesome, so I found one at my local school's library... The Funhouse. It was an okay book overall, but if I were Koontz, I would have stuck with the state of mind he was in when he wrote the prologue. The fifteen or so pages before the story actually began were the best out of the whole book. The rest of the book reminded me of the psychotic religious-obsessed mother in Carrie. I admit, the whole Conrad-meeting-his-firstborn-son's-mother's-children plot was pretty eventful, but I would have been happier with a nice Stephen King novel."
4,I loved it to hate it.,"When I first read this book, I hated it. Not because his book was not well written, but because it was too well written. I got scared out of my wits after I finished reading the book, but I came back for more. It is too good to put down, but after I finished reading it, I got nightmares for days after."
4,one of Koontz's better works,"Could have been better but I still got scared toward the end. Very creepy and scary and if you like being creeped out, you will like this one. canivals give me the creeps anyways. if you like carivals too, check out ""lightning"" i think, something like that. You know you have read too many Dean Koontz books when you can't even keep them straight anymore. lol (="
3,"Good story, but there was one major element missing!","I picked this up at my local gym. The plot seemed interesting, and I had never read one of Koontz's books before. I won't bother repeating the synopsis, but I can say that I did enjoy the book. As far as entertainment value, I was turning page after page. BUT....**slight spoiler**I could not believe the story ended without the mother coming face-to-face with the carny father. The kids ended up dealing with all the drama of the Dad's wrath, and the Mom wasn't involved at all. There was NO closure on the parents relationship, and/or the mother's anguish. I couldn't believe the book ended that way. It was quite a let-down.If you can overlook thiat glaring omission, the rest of the story was worth the read."
3,Pretty good,"The book started off awesome, but towards the end it seemed rushed and the ending was a big let-down! Koontz is a brilliant writer and it seemed that he could have made the ending better"
1,Worst book I've ever read....,"I usually like books by Dean Koontz, but this one was awful. The first half was boring for the most part and well, what happened to the second half? It just ended. Like he ran out of time or ideas (never had too many to begin with in this story) - don't know, but it really stinks! How this has gotten as many stars as it has is totally unbelievable!! Would give it 0 if I could."
2,Could have been a lot better...,"First of all I did not find The Funhouse even slightly scary. The closest it came was a few moments that were a tad creepy. The story itself, could have been intriguing, but it was messed up with focus on teenage hormones, turning it into one of those trashy horror movies. The worst thing was that the ending had no substance and was shoved into ten short pages."
4,Love it,"You can tell this is an older one, but it still has that same promised amazing twist that they all have!!"
3,Mr. Jeffrey's Mystery. Solved.,"This is not a review, just a correction. Mr. Robert E. Jeffrey seems to be shocked by the fact that he read EXACTLY THE SAME BOOK by a different author called Owen West. Apparently he is unaware of the fact that Dean Koontz uses two (of which I am aware) nom de plumes, one of which happens to be Owen West. So, no wonder that the books Mr. Jeffries read, were the same. They were written by the same person- Dean Koontz- under different names."
2,Very Very Weak,"This novel was alright through the first 100 pages or so, but after that this became abrasively boring and tedious. I had next 254 pages already played out in my head. Very predictable. I'm glad this is just an early novel by Dean Koontz writing as Owen West."
1,Waste of time!!,"This is the first Dean Koontz book I have ever read. I could almost picture him sitting and saying ""just let me get something down and meet my deadline"". The dialog was so juvenile! Horrible and don't waste your money or your time on this book. I understand that some of his work is better. I sure HOPE SO!"
1,The funhouse,"i ordered this book in hardcover, they sent me a paperback. not worth the hassel of returning it since i got free shipping with a minimum order. If you order hardcover, you expect to get a hardcover book, especially since the 2 other books in the order were also hardcover."
3,The Personal T.R.,"This Biography of Theodore Roosevelt is a very good and well written accounting of the personal side of his life. The book examines his youth, first marriage, and his time in the west in very good detail. The book fails miserably in it's exploration of the time TR spent in the White House. It falls far short of detailing the day to day political manuvering and his interaction with the other national political players. If you are primarily interested in his personal life, this is the book for you. If you are more interested in the compromise and delicate balanceing act of his national political career you should seek out other works. The biography by Henry F Pringle or Willaim H Harbaugh offer a far superior political biography and spend a little less time on the personal life. Because of this failing Miller's bio is not the advertised COMPLETE life. Other bio's are more Difinitive."
3,Works but Breaks Easy,I helps block out the sun but still hard to see screen on bright days. Worked like it said but very light weight and breaks easy. (coloradodeer.com)
5,Work of Pure Beauty,"A beautiful work. I don't know how anyone would not like it unless they approach it with prior expectations. It's probably not what you expect, even (or especially) if you're already a Jeff Johnson fan. The two songs sung by Janet Chvatal - ""O Redemptor"" and ""Nothing Immortal"" - are as beautiful as anything anywhere, and the rest is very fine."
4,The Whole Blue Eyed Gospel Soul Thing Rolled Into One..,"White Trash were an interesting band of jazz,soul,funk,gospel all rolled into one large cacophony of sound reminiscent of what was going down at the time with the likes of Delaney @ Bonnie, Joe Cocker's Mad Dogs and Englishmen, Blood Sweat @ Tears, The Flock..The maniacal screaming albino keyboard rocker Edgar, whose blues man brother Johnny Winter joins him on a track released this 2 LP LIVE set that is all shucking and jive, good musicians with the likes of Rick Derringer and Jerry LaCroix, an audible horn section ..all pretty unique stuff where musicianship was all very important.Edgar Winter was a trip."
1,lip sync,"I have never seen one of these ""movie versions"" of opera satisfactory. To me only live opera is worth watching. The filmed lip sync versions appear absurd and essentially boring. THE SINGERS ARE NOT SINGING!"
5,The Best Opera Movie Available,An incredibly beautiful movie with great singers in every role. Even the minor roles of Marullo and Ceprano are memorable. Major roles played by Furlanetto and Wixell are incredibly powerful. Don't miss this one.
2,Poor sound quality,"By quickly going through the reviews, none seems to have pointed out an apparent problem of this DVD. Sound quality is so bad and not at an acceptable level."
3,"Really good, but shows its age.","I don't know. I like it, but I don't. I'm an avid believer that if you have a nice home theater setup with a large screen, then you should expect sharp visuals and clean audio. Being an old opera production, the video shows its age.The audio and vocal performances are quite good, and will come across nicely with your home theater. I would enjoy this much better if produced in HD but keeping the elegant staging.Now, for those that do not care if they see ""film"" marks, or the 3:4 aspect ration, this is a 5 star production."
2,impressions of unit,"Unit looks very elegant, but It has a few hiccups like it will not play dual format disc the HD version,but it will play standard version.Go figure.Also rentals from netflix cross your fingers that they will play."
5,Wonderful learning tool,"I loved this CD. Sandra Ingerman shares her journey and what she has learned in a loving, easy to understand way. Everyone will get something out of this!"
1,Rubbish,Rubbish. Semi-autobiographical meanderings by aged communist writer trying to work out where communism went wrong and too stupid to see. One of those books better forgotten.
5,The Best of Robin Lee,"Robin Lee is the greatest country singer of our time, and for those unfamiliar with her music, this is as good an introduction as you're likely to find. Most people know her only through her hit single ""Black Velvet,"" but Robin is much more than just one song, and Black Velvet is far from her best. ""I'd Walk Through Fire,"" written by the team of Karen Staley and Gary Harrison, is destined to be a classic. ""Younger Love"" and ""Shine a Light on a Lie"" are great cuts as well..."
3,black velvet,"This CD was a slight dissapointment to me. It was not as great as I had expected. When Robin sings Black Velvet, she sounds different than usual. But it sounds good when you preview it. I'm not really familiar with what ""remastered"" means, but if that's it, I'll be sure not to buy any more like it."
1,Not a Movie,This was not a movie. It is only 25 minutes of shooting. Want my money back or send me the movie.
3,Mixed bag for Sinatra lovers,"Some great stuff on here, also a few clunkers. A little too much banter and filler that sounds very dated in between songs. But flashes of genius. sinatra and basie-- you can't go wrong."
5,MAKE IT ONE FOR MY BABY AND ANOTHER ONE FOR THE ROAD,"JUST IMAGHINE IT'S 1966, YOU'RE IN VEGAS, AT THE SANDS HOTEL (THE HIPPEST CASINO IN TOWN), SEEING FRANK SINATRA IN CONCERT WITH THE COUNT BASIE ORCHESTRA, WITH ARRANGEMENTS BY QUINCY JONES. YOU'D FEEL LIKE YOU DIED AND WENT TO HEAVEN, RIGHT? WELL, THIS CD WILL TAKE YOU RIGHT THERE......'NUFF SAID."
3,Expecting More- Getting Less,"The sound quality is excellent. The choice in music is disappointing. I can name FOUR Horner movie scores or background music that is breath-taking enough that they should have merited inclusion (but alas were not recorded here).I don't know the dates when these music pieces were released, but it could have been within a couple of years apart. Why? Because this collection has a few tracks that sound VERY SIMILAR. Hence, this CD does NOT fully explore the extent of this great composer's talent."
3,pretty good jackson5 inspired track,i use to bump this jam back in the day. TTT was always known for taken other songs or styles from the past&then adding there vibe over it&this cut has the Jackson 5 written all over it. this song has a good soulful feel&still is a Pretty good Jam. I miss the Tony's as a Band.i use to listen to there albums alot back in the day.
4,People either like it or are offended- I like it,"I've had this on a VHS tape for several years and I've noticed people are either horrifed or love this documentary. I've noticed the break is sort similar to feelings about Shelby Lee Adams photography.I like this film- it's got great dancing and the mud bog scene always makes me smile (and everyone else who has ever mud bogged!)On the otherhand I've got redneck relatives who won't watch it for fear of being offended....Violence, alcoholism, exploitation, and poverty of all sorts exist on every socio-economic level- and I guess if that's what you want to latch onto when you watch this- then you'll be offended-For myself, I see Jesco as someone who is really passionate about what he's doing-he's pretty good at it, and he defies sterotypes- I think the last thing you can say about this guy is he's not true to himself-Check out ""Tater Tomater"" too if you like this :)"
4,Great Book,"This is the 2nd novel I've read of the authors and I enjoyed it very much. Having twin 3 year old boys is what lured me in. The book kept me on the edge of my seat wondering who was behind it all. I did figure it out before the book told me who it was but not too soon to be bored. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the 3 year olds did seem to have a rather large vocabulary for their age, that part did seem very close to the edge of unrealistic."
4,Mary Higgins Clark at her best,"Most fans of Mary Higgins Clark have come to know what to expect from her novels, and she always delivers. Usually family oriented, her crime/drama stories always try to show the human side of all characters, even those you are supposed to hate. I would have liked a little more insight into the psychology of twins and the connection they are supposed to share, even when apart, but I guess there is only so much you can fit into one book.If you have enjoyed previous books by Mary Higgins Clark, you'll enjoy this latest offering."
1,Ridiculous,"Half of the novel consists of the moronic characters ""thinking"" to themselves in complete sentences. There are about thirty clues that hit these folks in the face, yet they luck into finding the bad guys almost by sheer luck. Since the reader already knows who all but one culprit is, this is not very entertaining plot work. When the final kidnapper is finally revealed, you mostly just scratch your head. He did what? Because of that? Come on..."
5,book review,"Classic Mary Higgins Clark! I always enjoy her stories and can't put it down. I race through the book to find out the ending, so it easy to read it more than once."
2,Thick seams chafe at the skin,"The bra looked great on me. Unfortunately, as the day wore on, the thick seam at end of the shoulder strap (where it meets the cup) started to chafe my skin. I have 2 sores on my skin now."
2,Not a VCD player,"DVD's work just fine in this player.But I purchased it with the intention of viewing home movie VCD's.Not happenin'.No matter what I try (VCD,SVCD,different cd-r disks,...) this model WILL NOT play them.I've seen DVD players costing under $100 play the very same VCD's without any problems."
1,DO NOT BUY this tripe. Just go ahead and flush your $$$,"...you'd be better off to just flush the $$$ down the toilet. At first this was a good DVD player...good but not exceptional. After about a year it started skipping like crazy and now, at a year and half, it will not even play most of my brand new DVDs. I have cleaned it- this machine is a malfunctioning piece of junk. NOW I find out that 1,000,000 other people have the same problem with Sony. I am on my way to buy a Panasonic or something. But anyway, be forewarned.....this product malfunctions..I promise you, it will happen. What a load of junk! I would recommend that you shop around and read reviews and stay away from Sony DVD players! I myself am going for Panasonic. To me,a Sony DVD player is what a strumpet is to a princess!!!!!!! The exact opposite of good."
3,Kind of a combination of weaving and macramé,"This is a hybrid based on many ancient skills and adapted to today's (1973) needs. There are a few intermediate diagrams and a lot of monochrome photos of finished products. The book seems to me more of an inspiration than a practical how-to.Table of contents:Working Arrangements, Materials and ToolsHow to Make and How to StartThe Peruvian Flat BraidEdge-to-Edge WeavingCenter-Edge Weaving- The Osage Indian BraidThe Chinese BraidMexican Double WeavingSquare and Round BraidsWidening, Narrowing, and SharpeningFinishing Techniques"
2,"Titus Reviews ""Into the Forge""","This book was not very good at all. McKiernan has unfortunately become more boring with each new book. This book mainly consisted of a detailed journey of a band of ""heroes"". Their travels were not exciting and were generally predictable. McKiernan still has a talent for describing battle scenes, but they are few and far between in this book. I've already bought ""Into the Fire"", so I'll probably end up reading it though I'm tempted to return it."
5,A must for the fiction fantasy readers,"As with all of his books, i have loved this story. I cant wait until book 2 is released, so i may finish this journey with Tip and his friends.Mckiernan once again spellbounds you with hisstory and remains tied as favorite author along with Terry Goodkind. I do hope book 2 is to be found soon though."
5,Perfect for wee ones,"We really like this toy box. It's a decent size and can old quite a lot of toys. Because the box itself is so light, it's really hard to overload it so much that it's hard to move, which is great for vacuuming. The best part is that it's soft, so our son doesn't hurt himself with the lid etc and he has been able to safely grab whatever toys he wants out of there since about 7 months of age. I have nothing negative to say about this product."
5,great toy box,When i ordered this product i didn't expect too much but i have to say i was very happy when it arrived. The colors are vibrant and i love the fact it is soft so no chance of pinching little fingers.
2,Would have been okay if it didn't smell so bad...,"I ended up returning it. After airing it out for 4 days, it still smelled terrible. I put a few toys in it on the 4th day to see what would happen, and the next day the TOYS smelled like the box. Ugh... what the heck was that smell?? Made me sick to my stomach and almost dizzy when I first opened it. If it wasn't for the smell, it would have been okay. I didn't like the way the lid fit, but that was a minor detail."
3,Good stuff but sound quality is bad,"While I admit Gary U.S. Bonds has always been a major talent & has done some fine work-I've always wondered if the guy recorded his songs in a phone booth or something? The sound quality, especially on his key hits, is really bad-sort of a muffled sound which is a shame since other acts from the same era all had good quality sound recordings. I will probably get blitzed for giving my not so humble opinion but at this point it's no skin off my nose."
2,Running out of steam,"Weather Report released two self-titled albums in their career -- their classic 1971 debut, and this 1982 album. The latter is the last recording of the most popular Weather Report lineup -- Zawinul, Shorter, Pastorius and Erskine. Much like its predecessor, Night Passage, this one sounds like a very competent, professional band that's out of fresh ideas and rehashes old ones. There are the same tight, third-world grooves with layered synthesizers and floating saxophone, but you've heard it all before and the tunes aren't especially memorable. (""Volcano for Hire"" is pretty cool nonetheless.) It's safe to skip this one unless you're a completist or raging Night Passage fan; and even if you are, you should probably jump ahead to 1983's superior Procession.[This review is based on the 1990 release, not the recent reissue. I do not know whether the new version has superior sound quality, but it does have an identical tracklist.]"
1,"No buy, is a steal.","If you said that is made in Argentina, I not buy this. Is a steal paid $42 for a these."
4,A classic for vocalists,"I became quite familiar with this recording as a teenager, when it came out, long before singing professionally! I remember listening and listening to it, the magic pulling me in. Now, after singing for many years, I recently became ""reaquainted"" with this ""old friend"". The vocals are still as mystifying and attracting as ever! I never realized that this was my first introduction to Patty LaBelle. The harmonies, the rhythmic timing, the general feel of this recording make it truly an excellent addition to any collection. For you ""young'uns"" out there, take a chance and treat your souls!"
5,Great workout,"I purchased this DVD based on the other great reviews because I was looking for a sculpting/toning workout with weights, but also a some pilates. I really enjoy this DVD because the sculpting sections have different exercises than I'm used to. The workout is broken into several different sections, so you don't have to do it all at once if you're short on time. I especially like the abs section and the floor section with weights. I'd say this is geared more for an intermediate level because there is not a lot of specific instruction on exercise form. There are two instructors, and one shows the modified form of the exercise at all times, which is helpful. I recommend this to anyone who is looking to tone up and add some new exercies to their routine."
3,"Good Stories, Mediocre Advice","What really captivated me in this book was the stories of both Britten and people she came across as a life coach. How Britten and others were distorted in thinking and action and how they rose above it was truly inspiring.The advice was okay, not as solid as I'd hoped. Some lessons I was already WAY past or they just didn't apply to me at all, others were right on the mark.HOWEVER, I also want to say I completely disagree with the review written by Publishers Weekly. They basically used their review of Britten to advertise a book they thought was better- mainly because it is geared towards men and not women. That is completely unfair and not very professional of the publication."
5,From Insight To Action!,"At last, a book that takes the reader from deep and powerful personal insights through a system that really works, to the actions that create true change and growth! While many self-help products on the market promise results like this, FEARLESS LIVING delivers.My own experience with Fearless Living has given me a way of orienting to the world that keeps me living out freedom instead of fear. From small daily choices that open up opportunities for joy, to professional decisions of paramount importance, the guidance of Rhonda Britten's book is amazing! Upon reading it, I kept thinking of person after person in my life that I care about. I want to buy a copy for each of them so they too can benefit from the power of this work.Tap into a new fearless way of living. Sense the possibilities all around you when the veil of fear is lifted and your true potential is accessed. Fearless Living IS Life Without Excuses, and Love Without Regret.Michael Arloski, Ph.D."
5,OPUS ONE,"OK ! Shame on me ! I've passed through the 70's without having heard one LP of BOC. Now, some 25 years later, disgusted by the actual music production, I'm going back to this period and listen actually to a lot of bands that have marked these golden years.So I ordered the first record of Blue Öyster Cult, and once received, after having sent my children to bed and my wife to the Post Office, I turned the volume on. And I played it, and played it again. And it was still great music. In short, BLUE ÖYSTER CULT is obviously a rock'n roll classic with 10 songs ranging from good (Workshop of the Telescopes, Screams) to excellent (Redeemed, Stairway to the Stars) or perfect (Transmaniacon MC, Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll).Anyway, a band able to write a song called - She's as beautiful as a Foot - can't be but praised.A CD for your library."
