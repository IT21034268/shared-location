2,Mediocre,"The most irritating thing to me about this book was the way the author would interrupt his own story about what is happening in the ""present"" (april '65) with character studies of the people involved. This seriously damaged the flow.I am a history buff, although the civil war is not one of my favorate eras. To me, this was a boring book."
2,Robert E. Lee as Ho Chi Minh?,"It stinks. The first half is a ""what if?"" What if, instead of surrendering at Appomattox, Lee had taken to the hills and set up a guerrilla army? Winik likens this to the Viet Cong. He ignores that Lee's army is starving, exhausted, and just wants to go home. Winik uses sports write throughout. ""Unlike a Washington, or a Jefferson...."" I finally gave up when he misquoted Stanton's great comment on Lincoln's death, ""now he belongs to the ages,"" as ""now he belongs to the angels."""
3,So So Work,"Much of what is in this book is repetative. There are a number of factual errors and the author goes of on tangents, that while relevant, interupt the flow of the book Overall, very disappointing"
2,"Not serious history, poorly organized","I have usually enjoyed history written by non-academic historians like Nathaniel Philbrick, but Jay Wink's book was a tremendous bore. I'm familiar with the period, but not a Civil War buff per se, and I was extremely disappointed. The narrative is full of unsupported generalizations, attempts to get inside the head of historical actors without any documentation from letters or other sources, and attempts to wax poetic that wouldn't make it past a freshman composition professor. Professional historians have been trained to avoid these mistakes, but Wink falls head-first into every possible type of error. Finally, the book is poorly organized, throwing in a long section about Lincoln's upbringing only after 200 pages, completely out of place."
5,Excellant book,"I think the most startling thing that the author presents in the book is how murky presidential succession was at the time Lincoln was assassinated. That and the fact that the peace that came out of our civil war was perhaps the least likely outcome. On top of that the author gives brief but important backgrounds on all the key players that had a part to play in the ending of our civil. Enough so that in my opinion if someone was to read only one book about our civil war, I would recommend April 1865."
3,Best Civil War book in a long time,"This is a magnificent book, as good as On The Brink, this author's first book. So many people think that the Civil War ended on April 9, 1865, but Winik explains how the war could have gone on for a long time but for the character and principles of some of the key players. I teach high school history, and have been an amateur Civil War historian since being born in Virginia, and this book is one of the top 4 or 5 I have ever read on this topic. Winik makes this war come alive with understanding and insight few others have had or at least been able to write. Highly recommended."
2,Disappointing and Poorly Written,"I was very disappointed in this book. For readers not very familiar with this period in American history, maybe there are surprises here. But Winik covers no new ground (I'm not sure there is any new ground left in terms of books on the Civil War). I can't imagine people like me who have already read a lot about the Civil War would find any of this to be interesting. He's not a very good writer, either. He's pompous and pretentious at times--and at other times he just writes badly. For example, at one point he talks about ""decapitating the seat of government."" How does one decapitate (literally, remove the head from) a seat? He gets certain historical facts wrong as well. I know this was a best seller and people just drool over it, but, really, it's not a very good book. If you want to learn about this particular time in our history, you can do a lot better."
3,interesting but disappointing,"Interesting and in-depth characterizations of leading figures (a fresh and sympathetic Lee) but several shortcomings: jumps around chronologically and leaves some tales unfinished until much later; annoying habit of putting many words in quotes without attribution-- as though someone definitely said them but we don't know who; about 1/4 of book is ""notes"" but actually a bibliography-- an endless list of sources of no immediate value to reader looking for interesting footnotes or more detailed information on a subject; finally, last few chapters devolve into author's pronouncements and conclusions that aren't nearly as interesting as the actual civil war"
1,"Far from ""amazing"" and ""incredible"".","Being required to read this book for school is the only reason I would have ever picked up this book. However, after the first 50 pages, I have decided to spare my brain from this utter nonsense.Winik spends far too long on unnecessary subjects such as the various meats and other foods served at Lincoln's inauguration. While the narrative on Monticello may be interesting to some, it served no purpose to why April 1865 was the month that saved America.Instead of trying to show readers that he is, in fact, an excellent writer who has done far too much research and therefore tries to shove every single fact he found into a 388 page book, Winik should focus on his thesis and not on his arrogant attitude and increasing sense of drama."
2,no not really,"this CD was just okay. i don't really know if it even reaches up to the standards of okay. i don't really want to diss this album becsuae i know that they put alot of work into it, but i must say that i didn't really enjoy the album at all."
4,Young Gunnaz!,"I dont know why everyone is hatin on these guys. Most of the songs on this cd are hot. They got some pretty good flows over some sick beats. The intro ""Future of the Roc"" is a great way to kick off the album, and the title of the track is right, they are the future of the roc. Other hot songs are ""look in your eyes""..""never take me alive""..""life we chose""..""north of death""... and others. Some say rocafella records will fall off cuz jay-z retired, but personally i think it will be better because it will open way for other artists to showcase their talents. And i personally think jay-z had no talent anyway. Actually i think jay-z sucks and his music sucks. Im glad he retired, no more gay music from gay-z. Go get this album if you havent already by the way."
3,IT'S THE ROC,"Before i got the cd i thought it was gonna be like more of an oldschool type cd, with oldschool beats and drums,like some of the previous material i have heard Young Chris use, i was a little dissapointed but overall the cd is allright. The first like 7 are good then a few pick up the pace. To me and i am not a fan of rnb rap songs but my fav is ""No better love"" the beat is great and the hook is soulfull. Are they the future of the Roc, i think so they just need to spice up there beats, probably hook up with Just Blaze and Kanye on the next album and they should pump out about 3 good singles. Overall i think the cd is one i can just jam to. Holla viva la Roc."
3,Remixed and remastered?,"Purchased because of the singer, the songs, and the conversion to the compact disc format, I found myself comparing the recording to my age-old long playing record Jamestown. I wondered if Capitol Studios messrs Norberg and Godfrey actually heard the original. The audio quality of the LP far exceeds that of this CD. I wondered what had happened to the ""air"" around the instruments, and in some parts, some instruments. This is not a diatribe against the CD format, I have many recordings whereby I cannot discern any differenec between the equivalent original LP and the re-issued CD. This is a disappointing recording re-issue of this great singer, accompanied by excellent orchestral arrangements.."
2,Reference Material Only,"While Godfrey has compiled, and reasonably well organized a great deal of information, his written presentation lacks style and readibility. The quality of writing is what one might expect from a newly-minted PhD attempting to gain recognition by publishing his/her dissertaion. I could not recommend this book to anyone looking for a general Farnsworth biography. For the occasional advanced undergraduate or graduate student studying the history of technology, I would recommend it for its reference value."
5,Early Hitchcock,"The director's art is revealed in these early classics. 1920s-1930s, from the silent era to early sound. primitive yet brilliant artistic mastery from one of the great masters of mystery."
1,unfortunately...useless for me,did not notice a thing and i would up the doses too. the ingredients are there but the amount is not. i would look to other cognitive enhancers like Brain Elevate
2,"Kinda slow, and nothing about games.","I agree with another reviewer: the author's intent seemed to be to discourage the reader. Not that he shhould have been all rosey, but it was always down.Also note: while the title says ""toy and game"" there is VERY VERY VERY little mention (much less, any info) about games. It's all about toys."
3,For Diehards Only,"Not that Crowned Unholy does not totally kick ass, but unless you are a diehard The Crown fan, or one who does not own Crowned in Terror, it is probably not worth purchasing. It pains me to say it, but this revamped version of Crowned in Terror does not feature enough new sounds to merit forking over 18 hard earned dollars. If you are a diehard, then by all means buy it. In case you are one who has not heard, this is not just Crowned in Terror w/ Johan in place of Lindberg. The entire album was re-recorded and re-produced! Whereas Crowned in Terror has a Death Race King feel to it, Crowned Unholy better resembles the sound of Posessed 13. The bonus DVD's biggest asset is its rarity, since I am unaware of any other formal video footage of The Crown. In a way, the DVD seems a little boring, due to the very small and cramped venue in which it was recorded, but remains fun to own and watch."
4,Such a help,"Already have the book, but i have a friend off to Spain and I want him to reap the benifits of this informative and helpful travel guide. If you like to be active while on holiday, this is the book to get."
1,No ink,"This item came in timely, but the dry erase pen did not work. What good is this without the ability to write on it? Terrible."
4,Fast and fun,"Meg is an impoverished heroine who wishes on a magic stone figure for a better life for herself and her four siblings, and the answer to her wish comes in the form of the Earl of Saxonhurst who must marry immediately or be stuck with the bride his evil grandmother chooses for him. Hijinks ensue when she leaves the statue in her old house and tries to retrieve it without his knowledge.The good:The humor. From the witty dialogue to the eccentric characters, including a mysogynistic parrot.The emotions. They're clear and on the page. Sax's habit of taking out his frustrations on the inanimate objects in his bedroom is particularly well done. As is Meg's guilt over having won Sax by magic warring with her desire to provide for and protect her siblings.The bad:I'd give this an extra half star, but Meg's stubborn insistence on not telling anyone anything went on just a wee bit too long.The verdict:A thoroughly delightful, romantic read."
5,if you love kayaks,"this book is a must have for any kayaker.I found it at the library and was amazed by the amount of info about traditional kayak design and techniques.I guess it was the accompanying text for an exhibition by the Alaska Division of State Museums.It was making the rounds in the mid-eighties and featured kayaks from all around the Arctic circle,such as siberia, greenland, baffin, etc. Too cool! If youre sick of 60# lugboats and are looking at lighter designs you have to check out this book."
3,Fatal Number,"Dick Frances brings to the short story a same wit and veer he as mastered so well in the field of fiction. Short of time to tackle a full-length novel, stick FIELD OF THIRTEEN in your pocket or purse and be prepared to entertain yourself while waiting for something. The delightful thing about a short story is you can master it before they call your number.The lengths vary and may be read at random; the same way Mr. Francis describes their selection.This volume is the perfect companion for a brown bag lunch, even in the winter. It gives you the chance to get lost in the world of racing, crooks, nice-guys, and fools.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS and QUALIFYING LAPS."
5,Great book,I like this book I am a lover of self help books to me and the kids and gave me some good ideas
5,Great dance moves,"I absolutely love this DVD, which is actually a replacement of my worn out video (which was a replacement of an earlier one). It is fun and keeps your mind engaged, while providing an excellent warm up and challenging moves that keep you in shape. The instructions are good for the first time and don't become boring or interfere with the pace when you are doing this for the 100th time."
2,Not Great,"There are three sections in this video. Unfortunately, the first dance section is terrible. The instructor counts out steps but never tells you what you're doing. Because there's no vocal instruction, it's nearly impossible to follow the dance movements and watch the video at the same time (most of the steps require a frequent head-down position). The video is very poorly filmed with too many tight shots on the upper bodies of the dancers, making it difficult to see the dance movements. The instructor also wears a filmy skirt that makes it impossible to see her movements clearly. If you are a trained dancer and have a good command of dance terms, you might be okay with this video. You will also need a space the size of a small rehearsal hall, not the small space most home exercisers have. The other two workouts were all right, although also with unfortunatly selected framing for a fitness video."
2,"New packaging, same old video!","While I love this video, I must warn that I have been loving it for, at least, 10 years. I bought it because I thought I was getting something new due to the new packaging and their claim that it is from 2008. I was very disappointed to start it and see that it is the very same video I have been using all these years and not something new.With that said, it is a good workout form me because it is very similar to a real dance class. I just don't like being tricked into buying a second one!"
3,too complicated for this beginner,"I am new to home workouts, not a dancer (though I would like to be!)... I thought I would try some DVDs to get some stamina/muscles before attempting a real dance class. This video is too hard for me to follow, and I spend more time trying to figure out where to put my feet than actually working out. It seems decent enough to save it for when I'm more advanced and/or have some dance training under my belt, but for now it's not worth my time. (I am loving the bellydance workouts by Veena and Neena... very easy to follow but still hard work!)"
5,honda crankcase pulley removal tool (LIFE SAVER),"A total life saver, well worth the money. This tool is very handy if you need to remove that stubborn crank pulley bolt. You don't even need an extra breaker bar because the way it is shaped causes it to jam it's self against the body of the car on the inside if the wheel well. When it came to getting that bolt out I tried just about everything, i even rented a 3/4 drive impact wrench. Nothing could do the job as easy as this tool! Amazon can have it at your door the next day and the shipping is only three bucks if you sign up as a premiere account holder! (7 day trial)"
5,It worths the money.,"It really help to do the job, and it is not expensive.Be sure to know that this item (50 mm) is for newer honda.Older Honda use a smaller one (42 mm)."
5,Works like a charm!,"I purchased this to change the timing belt on my wife's 2006 Odyssey minivan and it really helped me get the job done!Then, I was able to use it a few days later on my daughter's firs car, a 2001 Honda CRV...it fits many applications!Us a breaker bar with it and with the vehicle suspended on jackstands, as you loosen the crank pully nut, the breaker bar (1/2"") rests either on the floor or against the crossmember. Like I said, works great."
1,ron t,"this is a useless piece of crap, almost impossible to use under a car. It does fit the hex but u need a cheater and something to hold it still. Get a really heavy 19mm impact socket and a 3/4 to 1"" drive impact gun and it'll come loose. I'm glad i didn't spend much on this thing"
5,"Sometimes, it's better to bite the bullet and pay the cost.","Yes, I know you can find ways (listed on the Internet) of making this tool using plumbing bushings. I'm all for innovation, but I just did not have that ""warm fuzzy feeling"" about using a jury rigged tool at 170 ft. lbs. The Jury rigged tool was going to cost about half of what this tool costs. For me, it was worth the extra cost to feel comfortable fighting the unbelievable torque loads. I also needed, 2 very long breaker bars, a 3.5 ft long cheater bar (I almost had to use my 6 ft long cheater bar!), an extra deep 19mm impact (yes impact!) socket for my application (05' Honda 1.7L). The tool is very durable. You will never have to replace this tool, unless you loan it out or lose it. BTW you may be wondering what you can use to make a cheeter bar. I found that a cut down TV antenna masts works."
5,A must have tool for Honda timing belt replacement,"Removing the Honda crankshaft pulley is practically impossible without a tool like this. A big impact wrench may get the bolt out but you need this tool to torque the bolt back on. This tool does its job well. It is very well made, heavy duty. This is the cheapest way to remove the pulley. Once you get that bolt out the timing belt replacement is not too bad."
3,Solid tool..Good Price...Size is off,Tool helped. Only after it had to wedge itself in the hexagon. This product should have been larger so it didn't need to wedge itself in the hexagon and that is why I gave it 3 out of 5.Other then that flaw it helped hold the crank in one position and didn't brake or crack under the pressure.
5,Great tool for changing timing belt - Honda Civic 2002,"My friend and I initially tried like heck removing the crankcase pulley without this tool through the alternate route (by jamming the flywheel) and eventually gave up. After purchasing this tool, removing the crankcase pulley was (near) cake-walk, in less than a minute it came off. It's a great tool! :)"
2,Not an exact fit on 2004 Acura TL,"I have not yet used this to replace timing belt on my 2004 Honda 3.2TL. In the image, the tool looks like it's made of some resin but it is heavy steel. The hole inside is large enough to allow heavier-duty impact gun socket (19mm for the TL). I checked the Honda SST and it looked almost identical. I will update when I'm done with the job.When it comes to tools, I want made in USA/Japan but this tool is made in Taiwan so I removed one star.P.S; after having used this, I have noticed that this does not fit snugly on 2004 TL; there is a s;ight play and it marred the corners of the crank pulley. The actual size seems to be 5.5mm."
4,Worked for my 2000 Civic,You absolutely need this for crank bolt removal on 96-00 civics.... a long breaker bar to hold it as well.
4,Honda camshaft pulley tool,"Coould not have done the job without this tool worth the money, lot cheaper than Honda or or suppliers. It fitted good but could have fitted a little bit more snug to make job easier. All said it is a great value for the money and definitely necessary for my 1999 Honda CR-V timing belt job"
2,Too soft.,Loofa is a loofa is a loofa. I was looking for something really coarse for my boyfriend. He says it's too soft even though reviews for this product said it's too rough.
3,eh... one poacher is not enough,"The problem with this Poacher Set is that for me personally, I NEVER use it for the purpose of just one egg. When I make my own homemade Egg McMuffins for example, I use at least 3 eggs (for 3 sandwiches). This means I prefer to use another poacher I have that contains 3 places to set the 3 eggs. And this is just a breakfast meal for me. Imagine if I had a huge egg-eating family. I'd need a pan that would allow me to poach 10 eggs at once. I recommend -whether you're living alone or have a family- that you buy a poacher that's able to poach at the very least, 3 or 4 eggs at once. You won't regret it. Not that there's anything wrong with *this* poacher mind you, it's just too small for me."
4,"Very good, not quite perfect though","The brush itself is excellent. Very soft. But a couple things about it:-- Some of the hairs immediately started falling out. Maybe just loose from the factory, I don't know, but be very careful because they could get inside your camera body or stuck in a crack or something.-- Sharp metal edges on the front end (towards the brush. If you're careful, it'll be fine because the brush extends out almost 2 inches, but it would definitely scratch a lens or filter coating, they really should have wrapped the edges in a soft plastic in my opinion.-- There is no cover so the end of the brush (exactly the part that will come in contact with your lens) is exposed. If some grit gets in there is could be very bad, so you need to slap the brush around to clear it first.-- The main image shows THREE brushes, which makes it look like you're getting a three-pack for the price. You are not, you're getting one."
1,GOOD FOR A SHORT TIME ONLY,"I found that dubbing my old home movies to DVDs using the JVC DR-MV1S rather confusing but produced good results. Unfortunately, I no longer can play the DVDs I created on this unit. It has gone into a constant state of initialization where the unit display flashes 'LOADING' over and over. This is the second unit I have had as I had to return the first one because it would not eject the VCR tape without unplugging and replugging the electricity to the unit. Before going into a constant state of initialization, the second one also developed a high pitch noise when playing DVDs and then it would only play some of a DVD before the picture would become garbled. Essentially, I can't get it fixed and I've only had it for 9 months so I'm out $450. I recommend Amazon.com not carry the JVC DR-MV1S. In any case, I recommend strongly against buying the JVC DR-MV1S. I have had 2 and both failed to operate."
1,A total loss,"This machine has never worked since I unpacked it. It flashes the ""loading"" message constantly as soon as it is plugged in to electrical power. On/Off didn't work, nor did anything else. I wrote to the Panasonic help desk but got no reply. I intend to buy another brand ASAP and treat this as a lesson in why it's wise to check the Internet before buying expensive items. A total loss."
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible","That this machine was ever put on the market at all is a disgrace. It is almost impossible to use, comes with possibly the worst manual ever written, and just doesn't do half the things it is supposed to. I have never been so disappointed with a product in my life, and JVC either don't care, or are too incompetent, to support it. An absolute abomination.Nothing with the JVC brand on will ever come into my house again."
2,Way too complicated,"I received this item as a gift last month. Before I opened it, I came here to read the reviews. Although most people were unhappy, I figured I'd try it out anyway, since there was an extended return policy in place for the holidays.I wanted to record my precious VHS tapes to DVD but I needed to try it first on unimportant material. After a long time of trying to figure which button to use to program the unit, I successfully recorded a DVD. I did not get the ""LOADING"" message so many people described except for the first few seconds when it really was loading.It looks really sharp with my big new wide-screen HDTV but the instructions are so complicated for every process and the warnings here prompted me to return it.I'm going to wait six months or so, until the technology is more advanced and less confusing and the price drops somewhat."
1,"To the poor reviews I say ""amen""!","My purpose in buying this device was to transfer my edited digital home videos from camcorder to DVD disks via the firewire connection. It would invariably require several tries to get the recorder to recognize my camera. Much patience required. When I succeeded in making a transfer to a DVD disk, the sound was not synchronized with the video picture. The sound lagged a bit. Not so bad when you have music and scenery, but when someone is talking, as in an interview, it's disconcerting to the viewer. The device has been increasingly temperamental, and has finally refused to function. I am comforted in the thought that there are other poor souls sharing my frustration. Yeh, I get the ""LOADING"" signal too."
1,Electronic garbage,"Best advice: Do not buy this piece of cr*p hunk o'JUNK. It doesn't even deserve 1 star. It's the biggest waste of money ever. There are way too many problems with this machine to cite here, and JVC customer service is not helpful--the pits, as a matter of fact. I will NEVER buy another JVC product."
3,Good Fun,"Another gem from McAllister.The six year old twin girls are cute, the multitude of secondary characters interesting, and the author avoids the obvious cliches in both the rich fiance and the flaky mother. But the real selling point is the chemistry between the cranky hero and the bubbly heroine.I had a good time."
2,a rather disappointing return,"Compared to the original Greyhawk boxed set, or even the City of Greyhawk boxed set, this new ""return"" of Greyhawk is pathetic. TSR killed Greyhawk several years ago, and it seems they are intent on killing it by default again by not releasing quality materials. Fortunately I am an old Greyhawk fan and DM, and have a ton of material to reference and plenty of in-house produced stuff. One who is new to the world will be terribly disappointed. Shame on you TSR/WotC, for doing a disservice to this rich and vibrant campaign."
3,"Good info, but not enough for the exam","The information in this book is excellent and it's written in an easy to read format. However after reading this book cover to cover, and memorizing key terms through home-made flash cards, I found that this book isn't enough to pass the exam. I've tried taking numerous practice question exams, and while a good portion of the info in the book is addressed, I'm still averaging about 70-75% in each practice exam. Even the practice tests included on the CD-ROM give me that average score. I understand that it would be impossible for a book to cover every possible topic on the A+ exam, so I would recommend buying this book for the good info, but buy an additional A+ as well, preferably a Practice Questions book. The more study material you have the better. Good luck out there!"
1,CD is worthless,"If you get this book to take advantage of the CD, you just wasted your money.The book in itself is great but they couldve done away with the CD and sold it at a lower price.The Osborne McGraw CD gets this book its low score but the LearnKey customer service should get a 20+ stars for its tenaciousness in helping me get the problem resolved. It basically boils down to downloading 4 exe files from 3 different sources, changing the folder the disc wants to download to and rebooting about 2X.All in all, way too much then what should have to be done to view a simple video training demo.Do yourselves a favor, STAY AWAY FROM OSBORNE BOOKS WITH CDs.Its not worth the trouble. The actual content of the book itself is fantastic and very condusive for someone just starting. The CD makes a noble effort to be a frisbee. And it cant even do that well."
5,This author is fantastic!,"This is the second book I bought by this author. The other is for ""Network+"". The feature I love the best is the disk that comes with the book has the entire book in PDF format. You can install it in you laptop or work computer & read at your leisure or have Adobe Acrobat read out loud to you."
2,good for background but not for the test,"I have read the entire book and purchased the complete test bank on CD that Mike Myers offers. I studied the hardware questions till I was scoring in the mid 90%, on the 600 plus questions on hardware. I just passed the hardware section with 10 points to spare. This book should not be considered test prep material.. I am preparing for the software section of the test now using Test King. I do not have any professional experience in the IT field but I have been using computers since I build my first one that ran on CPM."
3,So So book,"Good ONLY for learning the certification test, has very little value when it comes to actually learning anything about how computers work."
3,Eh. Was a good read.,"I had to read the whole book on pdf because a friend of mine had lost my book, but I had the cd rom. I bought this book to study for the exam; which I believe that is what it was intended for. The main drawback I had was I wanted to study the glossary, which was not in the book at all, you have to look at it on pdf and then you can't print it. This was a major disappointment for me."
5,Loved it,Son and daughter both loved it. Its easy to build and cardboard is thick enough to withstand being stepped on.
3,Shaping tomorrow's company with today's technology or is it?,"Cairncross does an excellent job in describing what she believes will be the real impact of the Internet, changing the structure and practices of corporations. The dotcoms failed but that does not imply Internet technologies will. A valid point but her analysis implies that these changes are yet to occur, when in fact for many companies, utilizing the Internet for supply chain or human resource management are commonplace. The point is that what she writes is not ground breaking but instead a nice summary of what has been taking place in the corporate world over the last several years."
2,bad dvd,"i don`t know how you guys can sell bad used dvds , i bought 4 and only one was good , the rest were badley scratched , even this one"
4,Nothin' but the bass-ics!,"Any jazz fan worth his/her salt should, at least, give this CD a listen. Bought it at a flea market-type sale and it's probably the best bargain in music I've ever bought. ""Justice's Theme"" is one of those tunes you may have heard in the past but didn't really know what it was. The late George Howard lending his sax to the title track is sensational. My favorite cut is theme to ""Boyz In The Hood"". Believe me, it's not what you may think. Also, ""What If I Forget The Champagne"" has a hint of Latin to it. I think the tune is great for those who want to get closer than close. ""Christmas in Rio"" is inspirational. The tribute to Cesar Chavez is great. This CD should've gotten more airplay. Everyone who's listened to my copy wanted my copy (naturally, I told them to buy their own copy). This is a can't miss CD."
2,JUST THREE GOOD TRACKS,I was disappointed with this CD. The three tracks that had gotten radio airplay are outstanding. I would recommend downloading those tracks as opposed to buying a CD where most of the tracks were done as purely an exercise in virtuosity and are barely listenable
2,Cd doesn't Merit the hype,We thought we would enjoy a trip down memory lane with 3 singers we remember from our childhood. I don't believe anything recorded by them after 1960 is on the CDs. Maybe someone in their seventies would like it. It is boring with all the same type songs. Would not buy it again.
5,Excellent for beginners!,"This book is excellent for beginners! It explains things that would normally seem very complex in a simple, concise manner. It skips all the technical stuff that most other books feel you need to know, even though you don't. I got a page made for myself in just a few hours! I now use it to share photos and information with my family. I would recommend this for anyone who knows nothing about computers."
2,"Not my idea of a ""handbook""","It is my feeling that this book is not presented and advertised correctly on this website and that it is not reaching its target audiences. This is an introductory and all-inclusive manual for a student, or for a PR professor who needs to prepare his or her lessons. It's a textbook that one needs to sit down and study, hence not my concept of a practical handbook. I much preferred another book on the same topic, because it contained less theory and more practical how-to.In short, I think that this book failed preciselly at what it meant to teach: Public Relations. At least on amazon.com."
5,Unexpectedly totally brilliant,"I heard a track that I liked so I bought the album. There is not one bad track here. The sound is very polished but not overly so. Philippe Katerine has been hard at work in the production dept. and comes up with his best sounding disk to date. Glad to see Bertrand Burgulat involved too, you should really check out his Ssound of Mmusic album...Helena's voice works just as well in French as in Brazillian portuguese.Gives Bebel Gilberto a run for her money. Un disque super."
4,All The Info,I love all of the information this book offers. Nice pictures. Could have better organization though. I'm very glad I bought this book. 4 Stars
2,Boring unless you like to read minutia & details of raising 3 kids alone where nothing ever happens,"Sorry but I couldn't finish this. The story was extremely slow-moving and nothing ever seemed to happen. I skipped ahead a lot of pages before anything ever happened, and even when it sort of did, it was boring. I'm just not that into the everyday minutia of raising kids even though I've done it. I want a story with adventure and excitement and this definitely didn't have any."
3,Good and informative but not a high light,This video is well made and gives some informative inputs. I am missing some real shooting samples except on the beginning of the video. But in general price vs. value it is ok.
1,Seller Lied,The seller of this product didn't ship product as shown or stated in the Feature section.I ordered 2 set and received 4 different color instead of 6 different color cables. They sent me 3 cables per color for 4 different colors.
5,I'm glad I have it!,"(...) The ETX 70 really likes dark skies (being a rich field refractor and all) and this is perfect for getting it there. Lots of nifty pockets for eyepieces (of all sizes if you use your imagination) for a flashlight, a bubble level, and (of course) the scope. They tell me you can even get the dew shield and the right angle finder in it. It's also great for storing the scope and carrying everything to the backyard. The case seems rather sturdy and, while nothing is completely kid-proof, it's kept the scope safe from little girls -- so far!"
2,The Egyptology Handbook,"This was disappointing -- I expected a large DK-like book, but this is small and not nearly as much information in it as expected. I ended up purchasing the DK Egypt book (at Barnes & Noble) and giving this one with it."
5,Wow -- finally some advice that makes sense,"This is a carefully thought-through way to change the way you relate to food. It's based on the simple idea that you're not going to change your habits overnight, so you're asked to make changes over the course of time. You lose weight by paying more attention to what you're eating, and not eating too much of it -- it's not a typical diet program.Independent of the book, the program is also offered on the web at changeone.com -- which may be a unique tie-in with a book of this kind. They're offering a free trial week there now."
2,drummer?,"This is the worst Methney album I have heard to date. Although it has some great guitar playing in parts most of the CD is totally ruined by monotonous hip-hop beats which,in my opinion, have no place in jazz. Where's the freedom and improvization which jazz is known for? In fact, I'm not even convinced the drummer was playing at all. For most of the set it sounds as if the drummer switched on the drum machine and went out for a smoke. There are a lot of good Methney albums out there, but this is not one of them. Save you money."
1,Not For Everyone,"This video contains prolonged footage of Marty Stouffer's wife in late pregnancy wearing a tiny bikini. Footage starts by slowly scanning her body as she lies in a lounge chair. Then she stands up and poses for the camera. Marty and his daughter then fondle her belly. If modesty is an issue for you, you may want to avoid this video."
5,Keeps my skin moisturized not GREASY!!,"I bought this lotion a couple of weeks ago and I absolutely LOVE it!!. I'm not too thrilled about the scent, but that wears off after minutes. What I LOVE is that it keeps my skin moisturized for hours! I was using Clinique's Deep Moisture Cream/Lotion and I must say for half the price, I get a better product and my skin remains moisturized longer. I also love how my skin absorbs the lotion quickly leaving my skin soft not GREASY like other lotions/creams. I really LOVE it and I will continue to use it on my extremely dry skin!"
3,Feels good but Shoo weee!,"I love the way this product feels on my skin. I have incredibly dry, itchy tight skin and I have senstive skin which limits me to what I can put on it. I was using Aveeno which aleves the itchy tightness but make me feel sticky for DAYS. So I tried this and it works well but I just can't get past the smell. It smells like mud, baby powerder (which I hate) and coconut mixed together and the smell is so strong my mom down stairs can smell me when I wear it. Its just too over powering to wear and makes me have a headache ( I'm incredibly sensitive to perfumes) . Too bad too cause I'd love to love this product!! Its great for your face before you put on makeup though!! Exspecially powerder foundation like I wear!"
4,Definately for beginners. Potentially boring for anyone in decent shape,I purchased this DVD to supplement my recovery program from a serious back injury. I am a former competitive kick boxer and consider myself to be in pretty good shape.The DVD is great for learning the fundamentals of Pilates and really helpful for people with injuries who need to be extra careful. However I cannot say it's much of a workout for people already in decent shape. I have only tried the beginner workout though.
1,Manwar's worst album,"I am a die hard Manowar fan. They are the best heavy metal band in existance. Every recording they have produced is excellent with 6 or 7 great songs. Louder than Hell is the exception. It is by far Manowar's worst album. There are no real good songs on this recording. The songs seem to have been written from a formula or template. They are are boring. Even after many listens I think the whole ablum is terrible. I recommend Hail to England, Fighting the World, and Sign of the Hammer for those new to Manowar."
1,Garbage,"I litterally mailed this album to Hell. I microwaved it (if you've never done it, you must microwave at least one CD), broke it into pieces, then addressed the envelope to Hell, stamped it, and mailed the MoFo. It was that bad. Manowar, once Kings of Metal, have become Clowns of the Armageddon. Avoid later Manowar at all cost. Everything Triumph and back is awesome. Steel and death and kings and might, we are strong and bold and right. Fight and kill and die and fight, steel and kill and fight and might. They've become cliches of themselves. You suck Manowar. Eat Shizite and die.This album deserves NO stars, but the world demands one. I hate you world. Burn in hell. I will deliver thee to ash. ROAR!"
2,DISSAPOINTING,"I heard Brothers of Metal on the radio and found it to be one of the most driving metal songs ever, so I bought the album. Courage was very inspiring too. They had that blistering guitar solo as the second to last track which was awesome. The rest of it......repetitive stuff, same guitar slash and bass lines again and again, quite boring. When I see so many five star reviews for a mediocre album at best, I start to doubt the credibility of fan reviews on Amazon"
2,Was not packed properly; dishes broke,"The plates I ordered were exactly what I expected. However, they were shipped to me without any protective packaging -- just a box of dishes dropped into a cardboard box that wasn't even marked ""fragile"". Almost half the order was broken -- shattered, actually -- when they arrived (the miracle is that they all weren't broken). Since this was a Christmas gift, it was inconvenient, to say the least."
3,Went to Town with This Guidebook,"Maybe Europe really isn't that foreign of a place, but I used this guidebook less than I anticipated. I planned really well before I left for Europe, so I wasn't spazzing out when I got there. The maps of the cities and the subway are indispensable. It is also a good value for your money. I do not like the fact that it's bulky; it makes you look like a tourist even more. Good for your first trip to Europe, but hopefully, by the time you return, you'll indulge yourself to more elegant appointments than the ones this recommends."
4,Great Sanbord CD,"This is a re-hash and re-packaging of the 1970's vinyl album ""Beck"" which is still availabe in the form of a Japanese import on Amazone, albeit for a hefty price. This is fine album and a great example of jazz session artist David Sanborn before he had his own career."
3,Lay it Down,I enjoy Cowboy Junkies but some of their stuff can be a little weird. I don't think anything can beat Trinity Revisited with the DVD.
5,This is one of the best bands out there.,If you're treading water and looking for some new music that you've not heard before then by all means try CJ. Whether you like to go clubbing or sit at home with John Denver's guitar this CD will touch you. This band is tight and has excellent repoir on stage. See them live if you can!
3,Worth Reading!,"This book tells the story of Frida, one of only two women to survive the massacre of over 30,000 Jews in the Rumbuli Forest. She was determined to live so that she could tell the story to others and the victims would not be forgotten.As with any book about the Holocaust, a few parts were difficult to read, but it was definitely worth it."
2,Unpleasant Lemon Flavor,"I'm not a fan of the lemon scent/flavor as it doesn't make the caps taste any better, it just gives them a strange odor.Also, I experienced some unpleasant fish burps when I took these with a protein shake. Taking them with large, solid meals reduced this effect.These pills aren't so bad that I won't finish the bottle, but I definitely won't be buying them again."
4,Solo Eagle,"When The Eagles broke up in the 1980's, two members landed outstanding solo projects. One of them was Don Henley. Actual Miles blends all three of his studio albums, into one great package. The songs feature his hits Sunset Grill, and The Heart Of The Matter. It also features three new tracks.The Garden Of Allah, is the so-called sequel to Hotel California. I thought it was even more frightening and enjoyable, than its prequel. You Don't Know Me At All brings classic rock and excitement in its depths of hard core Henley fanatics. Everybody Knows is a remake of a Lenord Cohen tune. This song was off the 1995 album Tower Of Song: The Songs of Leonard Cohen.While fans still look foward to his songs with The Eagles, Don Henley proved to break down the walls, and tell haunting and understanding stories of pop music in each of our lives. It is not the end of the innocence. It still is continuing on."
1,this is a joke that i didn't understand,"he has become a caramel coated staple of rock with his joke band, theeagles. on every station you heard em they are all here. and they allsound so different. you would never know it was don. he is so talented. every song you hate is here on this cd. if you really care about music and what it stands for, you hate this music and live to see the day it is gone. END"
1,I got this as a gift...,and it was probably pre owned by someone who realised they had done a horrible mistake in buying this cd. Anyone want to trade?
1,Poor compilation of a big one!!,Can't understand why some guys forget to include the most famous songs in the compilations...what about 'Johnny Can't Read'!??oohh God!! I love that song!this is just a waste of money!!
3,Not very descript,"This is one I honestly gotta say the movies were all better than the book. Being that this is a true story, the details were pretty lack luster. The way every chapter ended in an exclimation point got really annoying quickly. Overall, if you want to partake in an enjoyable true ghost story, watch any one of the versions of the movie. They are much more descript and vastly more entertaining."
1,Amityville Borer,"Frankly, a poorly written, poorly crafted, lame book--not worth writing a thing about at all! The only thing frightful about this book really is how many readers found this book scary and or enjoyable. Better to use this book for kindling prior to lighting the fire to read by and sitting down to a chiller Lumley, now that man can write!"
3,exaggerated and totally made up ... left me annoyed,"The Amityville Horror was an easy and fast read, but to market it as a true story? Come on! I would have enjoyed this book as fiction, maybe it would even creep me out a bit. Instead, I found myself reading chapter after chapter filled with evil spirits, ghosts, a pig roaming the house and green slime oozing from the walls, all the while thinking how on earth would anyone believe that these things actually happened. The green slime made me think of Nickelodeon :o)"
4,The scariest story i have read in years.....,"The Amityville Horror by Jay Anson is the story of a family who had moved in to a new house in Amityville, Long Island, not knowing that the home was supposedly built on top of an ancient Indian burial ground. Rarely does a book ever captivate me, yet this one captured my attention immediately. From the first two sentences, ""George and Kathy Lutz moved into 112 Ocean Avenue on December 18. Twenty-eight days later, they fled in terror,""(p.7) you are interested in what it is that could make a person flee from their brand new home in just 4 weeks. Further into the book, bizarre phenomena occurs creating a terrifying experience for the Lutz family. From the daughters demonic friend ""Jodie"", to Father Mancuso falling deathly ill anytime he steps in to the house your trapped. This is a horrifying book based on the encounters this family has had. But the scariest thing of all is...it is said to be true!"
5,The Amityvlle Horror,"The Amityville Horror is a genuinely erie piece. It is reasonably well written and often awakens the icy fingers of fear along the spine of the open-minded. Even it if was a hoaxe in reality, the story, as told by Jay Anson, is disturbingly believable and enjoyable for any fan of supernatural horror, fiction or nonfiction. Read it with an open mind and a dimly lit room.........Get out!"
2,"Just a tall tale, totally unsubstantiated","When I saw this in the ""true crime"" section at the book store I thought it was about the De Feo murders, but it's about the subsequent family (the Lutzes) to occupy the house. The story is told in an omniscient narrative style, like Cub Scouts telling ghost stories around a camp fire (""Then the priest heard a voice saying..."") --which is OK if that's what you're looking for. (""Lions and tigers and bears --oh my!"") There are no photos nor any other semblance of proof. The author claims that paranormal activities were a regular occurrence even before the De Feos lived there, but the family living in that house today doesn't tell any ghost stories. Perhaps Amazon said it best when they labeled this a ""Mass Market Paperback."""
4,Scary!,"This book was very scary. Be sure to start reading it in daylight so you can finish it before nightfall! Otherwise, it'll scare the pants off you!"
4,Connemara in the rain,Poetic account of one Canadian's experience of life on a small island - Inishturk - in the far west of Ireland. The miseries of winter - 'the terrible frosts and the sly damp...making old fractures of wrist and pelvis ache' soon shatter illusions. And 'the house where the drowned man lived has been empty four winters.'They say that seals are ghosts of the drowned. Plenty hereabouts!
4,Lost treasure,Wow why did I wait so long to buy this?? This is a really good CD. Just good straight ahead rock and roll.
5,In response to anyone damning the vocalist,"I believe the choice of that vocalist, was by all means a wise choice, come on we have too many droning Kurt Cobain/Eddie Vedder copies and clones. Screaming vocals is what rock and roll was all about, and Slash if we all remember comes from a band that made their mark with the trademark screams of Axl Rose, why not give the fans what they want, more Guns N' Roses style music, which is exactly what he's done on this album. So you can't slate this album for vocals, or guitar playing or any musical aspect, you're obviously not paying attention, in this modern music world, this is a rock masterpiece!"
3,"Good, but not great","This is an OK CD, if your a Slash fan you'll like it otherwise you may want to pass on it."
1,Slash should leave us alone,"It's hard to decide which is worse, the songs or the playing. While the songs are pretty terrible, the guitar playing is atrocious. Slash was kept in check when he was in Guns, but here he's given free reign, and somebody told him he could play the guitar. He should look at Axl and how Axl has stayed out of the limelight and he should do the same. Axl was the talent."
5,algo de lo mejor,"es un albúm excelente, Slash sigue siendo uno de los mejores guitarristas que he podido escuchar y este Cd, lo acredita, las mejores canciones Neither Can I, Be the ball, aunque algo que lo malogra es Eric, (mala imitación de Axl), espero que ya no esté en el proximo cd..."
1,5:00 = BAD,"Slash may be right that it's five o'clock somewhere, but it's also true that this is a horrible collection of music. Memo to Slash: Give it up."
1,MY EARS ARE IN PAIN,"I have a theory. Slash felt guilty about all the money he made with his pedestrian band Gun's and Rosers. He decided to show the world that he isn't the least bit talented, he just happened to be at the right place at the right time, and his band had a talented and good looking lead singer, Axl Rose. Slash put out this album to prove that he can't play the guitar or write songs very well. He must have felt a tremendous amount of guilt over the fact that his band was so popular, yet he was no the least bit talented. This disc proves to everyone once and for all that he's just some guy with leather pants and a vintage guitar. We should thank him for coming clean."
1,A HORRIBLE ALBUM FROM A PITIFULL GUITARIST,"Slash, Please leave us alone. Your guitar playing is terrible, your songwriting is awefull. Can't you go away quietly like AXL?"
3,It Doesn't Add Up,"Since when does 1344 x 1024 translate to 3 megapixels? I don't own it, but I would have purchased it if it would have been a 3 megapixel camera. Since it isn't, I'm sure it's a good 1.3+ megapixel camera."
5,Great Job,"I thought this book was very interesting. I liked how Estevan started the first chapter in the present and then went back. It was very suspensful and I didn't want to put it down. Also it makes you think if you could see your future, would you take the chance to know or let it be a mystery... I liked how the characters and their lifestyle was so real. With the great detail and description that Estevan used, I felt like I was there and could see everything that was going on. I think he is a great writer, and especially for his first book, i thought it was very good. I wish you continued success.-Trisha"
1,WOW!,"I read this book and I was impressed.......With the stupidity. Is this some kind of joke this kid is trying to play. Aight dude, the jokes over, you can stop writing real bad books now. I don't know what this kid is thinking but this book is the worst written, no sense making, thing i have read in my life. I live on the west coast and I spend my weekends and nights reading. There was buzz here about this kid outta Xavier in Middletown, CT so i picked up this book. WHAT A MISTAKE. I had to read multiple books over and over to get the stupidity of this book out of my head. Some advice for this Estevan character, keep your books to yourself and dont expose garbage like this to the public....EVER AGAIN. This really isnt a kids review I just didnt wanna put in my credit card info to review this garbage, it really wasnt worth it, I just wanted to warn the world about how bad of a book this really is. Peace."
1,Was this a price test?,Same as everybody but I found the $1899 through a number of price watch websites. This aspect really bothers be because they advertised one price throughout the web then decide they either made a mistake or could make $3200 per unit. Not only did the price jump but the cost of shipping as well (from ~$29 to $120+).I know they perform price tests at times to find the sweet spot in the category but this is just wrong. Please take your lumps and honor the contract (sales receipt) Amazon/Target.
1,Greek Nescafe?,Nescafe Classic is Nescafe Classic.There is NO Greek Nescafe.You can use ANY Nescafe Classic to make 'frappe' if you want. You can use Nescafe Clasico (sold by Amazon LLC for $ 18.65 for 3 glass jars of 7 ounce each and free shipping) and it is way cheaper than this tinny Greek product and it is 100% the same Nescafe Classic sold all over the world. There is no need/reason to pay this much for the same product.People who have never tasted good instant coffee I recommend Nescafe Gold. Not sold in the US but known and enjoyed by millions around the world.
5,"Buffalo Bill's wild, wild West","William Cody was the most famous American of his times, renowned as a Pony Express rider, soldier, buffalo hunter and overall hero - but his creation of the Wild West show, a traveling company of cowboys and Indians which toured North American and Europe for over thirty years, solidified his importance and his name. BUFFALO BILL'S AMERICA: WILLIAM CODY AND THE WILD WEST SHOW provides the most detailed critical biography of Cody to appear in over forty years, considering his showmanship, his achievements, and the controversies which swirled around his life, both during time and into modern times. Chapters use source material references and quotes but maintain a lively style which lends to appeal by leisure audiences as well as students of American history."
4,Up and Coming Author,The author is a dark soul who gives you insight to the emotions in each poem. This kind of raw emotion gives the reader a first hand glance at the author's life expericences. Highly recommended.
1,This is NOT the 1917 Edition!,At first I thought this was the first edition until I looked at the product information. Don't be fooled! This isn't it!
1,DO NOT BUY,This was a copy of what is listed. The seller did not mention this was HOMEMADE COPY. DO NOT BUY ANY OF HIS MERCHANDISE.
2,ozzy speak of the devil dvd poor quality,"i have had many bootlegs of this over the past 25 or more years and most of them are better quality than this, i dont know if this is official or not but its not worth your money, i gave it 2 stars for the audio alone video is crap!"
3,OZZY!!!!,It was as I expected. Ozzy always puts on a good show. Some of the overdubs were obvious. They should have overdubbed Brad Gillis. Replacing Rhoads is no easy task but the solos on Over the Mountain and Mr. Crowley weren't even close.
3,More Than Killing Time,"Good movie, but the protagonist and the antagonist did not have a final knock down drag out at the end. The monster killing the antagonist is not the same thing. Even if you did have the monster do the killing of the ""bad guy"" there stilll should have been a big fight first. The ending set up the scenerio for the sequal a little too much. One was expecting more in this movie with all of the set up. This was a good movie though, but too much killing from too many killers. None of the killers were given a personality; not a one. Less killing , more action and adding a little more romance would have made this movie better. But good effort."
5,good,"I received this item fast, in a good condition. Product is good as well. Dalissime by Salvador Dali is my all time favorite perfume.I wear it almost every day. Sweet but delicate scent. Recommend it."
1,"Heavy, slow, powerless. I hate it.","IT weighs a ton. It has no ""blow"" power and takes FOREVER to dry my hair. Once it's dry, it's flat. Any natural waves have just given up the ghost, regardless of hair product used.I hate it. And I've replaced it. Waste of money."
5,Excellent!,"Great! Quiet, quick, pretty. Lots of setting options. Dries much quicker than my other dryer. Less frizz too. Definitely my favorite dryer I've had. More professional. Also shipped quickly. I'd recommend."
3,Suunto T3 Heart Rate Monitor,"I bought this as a suggestion of one of my biking buddies. He has the T4 but I opted for the T3. I also ordered the PC Pod and Bike Pod.QualityThe first bike pod did not work, the second one did. The replacment process was great on that one. The T3 is pretty nice but within 30 days it has a dead spot in the display running from top to bottom so that 0's look like ( ). For this I have to return it to the manufactur rather than amazon. My buddy has problems with his pc pod working so I'm not too wild about the quality so far.FuncionalityIt works very well and has not ever lost signal. It has 99% of the features I want but it is very complicated and frustrating to learn. I'm a visual learner and have a tough time trying to follow the button sequence to get where I need to be. The screen is small so the graph indicators around the edge are worthless to me. I leave it on the heart rate or TE most times and download for study later."
4,snow clogs,"I work at a ski area and these clogs are excellent for walking on snow and ice, plus they are comfortable and warm."
2,Not sure if I did it right but it definitely didn't work,"One other commenter mentioned that there are few instructions. I could have used more myself. I have a toilet with an unlevel flange on cement and I can't make wax rings work to save my life. So, I bought this.I followed the instructions on cleaning the existing toilet. I removed the paper cover from the top of the seal and stuck it to the toilet around the horn. It didn't seem to be sticking properly; it felt like a spot wasn't sealing. When I moved it a little bit to check the adhesion, the entire seal fell off as if there were no adhesive at all.This was a complete waste of my money. Maybe I did something wrong, I'm still trying to figure it out."
1,broken in the box,It took 1 and 1/2 hours to put it together without directions (their in Japanese)and only pictures. The arms did not fit. The posts they were suppose to fit on were to short. The walking mechanism was broken and it would not walk. My son would have still loved it if the arms would have stayed on. Junk. Returning it is a real pain. I won't be buying anything from Amazon Marketplace again.
2,Who knew there was a profanity badge????,"A PG rating must have meant something entirely different when this movie came out. The movie is full of words unsuitable for children, and the beginning sequence has a crude discussion about infidelity. Too bad - the movie would be great for families without all that. As it was, I had some apologizing to do to a couple moms whose daughters watched the movie with mine (9 & 10). Good times! (That's sarcasm, folks!)"
4,"""Troop Beverly Hills""","One of the all time great family comedy classics. Shelley Long and eight kids who make a terrific team. Beverly Hills is the better off for their being there. A great laugh, a very well made movie with a very good ending.Three cheers for Troop Beverly Hills. Every family should own a copy of this movie."
4,Troop Beverly Hills,Seller sent this classic 90's DVD in a timely manner. I haven't actually viewed it yet but I'm sure it will be just fine. Kudo's to the seller. Thanks
4,A beautiful start for the Royally Wed series!,"The series begins when Princess Alexandra of Wynborough learns that there's a possibility that her brother, who was kidnapped & supposedly died in America when he was a baby, may still be alive.Alex hotfoots it to Mitch's ranch, hoping that his stepbrother could be the missing royal heir. Instead, she finds love & laughter in this most unprincessly setting.While the premise of the series is rather flimsy, Ms. Mallery does put out a very light & engaging read. Don't miss the rest of the Wynborough series (in order): Undercover Princess, The Princess' White Knight, The Pregnant Princess & Man Mercenary Monarch."
4,"Awesome Band, Decent Collection","Well, what can I say. I unfortunately discovered this under-rated band way past their heyday. This, however, is a pretty good celebration of their career.I have had this album in a pretty regular rotation since I purchased this record in '97. I do agree with others, who say they could have made a few better decisions in terms of what tracks to include, but hey, this is still one of the best ""Greatest Hits"" albums I own. They included something from just about every album, and of course the radio standards (Signs, Love Song).This is a really decent collection spanning Tesla's career. The new album is released today, and I am so far impressed. First, radio has been giving an 80's band with a new record some airplay. Second, the band has kept to the same formula, and haven't tried to be like Nickelback or Staind. In other words, they've stayed true to themselves, just like they have always done."
1,I just didn't like it...,"This is just my humble opinion, but I thought the daughters would have all benefited from psychiatric help. Some of the things that they did were just silly. Reading about silly women is not my idea of entertainment."
1,bad bad bad,This product does not live up to the hype! It leaks through the rubber seal and sweats. Save your money.
5,amazing album which stands on its own,"This is not Question and Answer, Bright Sized Life or a typical PMG album. This is a much more mellow and free formed recording. It isn't to be rated as a comparison to anything, it stands by itself as an excellent piece of music because it is unlike anything else that the PGM has ever done. Nice Job !!!!"
3,Part Metheny,"If you pick and choose (iPod), one can find a half an album of painterly musical portraits that I associate with Pat Metheny, particularly cuts: 1,2,5,6,12,13,14,15. I guess that my DJ ear has been spoiled by Metheny products that hang together as concept albums. I borrowed my copy from a public library."
5,Yummy!,"Whether you are new to Howie Day or just don't have this EP - it is most definately worth the cost!! The DVD is amazing. Howie comes onto stage with his guitar and hooks it up some crazy electronic rig on the floor and proceeds to layer guitar sounds and vocals until he creates, in real time, a layered song that he brings different sounds in and out of by tapping his foot. The guy is seriously slick and his ability alone is astounding besides the fact that the songs are quite good."
5,A seminal work,"An excellent work in which the authors look intensely at one aspect of a subject (runaways) to throw light on the whole (i.e., slavery and how terrible it actually was). Very readable, excellent use of primary source materials. A little slow going at first, where there's not much analysis. The problems the first reviewer cited are due to gaps in the primary sources."
3,Hagin Knows GOD,"any book by Hagin is a resource that every minister should read and study Hagins life and style. Hagin prayed and prayed for hours a day, Hagin was a boy on his death bed for several YEARS, He read the bible about 5 minutes a day and fell asleep, day by day he gained a little strength, it took years to recover, But Hagin has more hours of Prayer of any person,and KNOWS GOD"
4,Important.,"The 1950s. Today conceived as a mish-mash of artificiality -- fake clothes, fake materials, fake faces, fake lives, fake lawns, fake barbecues, fake politics, fake economies -- and of staticism.Lhamon rips asunder the myth of the 1950s and explores how the decade instead provided a turbulent, dynamic foundation for the forces that have shaped present-day.Those who wish to understand the antecedents of contemporary America would do well to start here."
2,disappointed,"I purchased this to go with my newly redecorated bathroom and was very disappointed that after filling it with hand soap, the tip became rusted and each time we pumped the soap out rusted soap came out first"
2,Simple charm bracelet.,"Ordered this for my girlfriend for Christmas. Not bad for a cheap charm bracelet but keep in mind that if the person to wear this does not have a small wrist then it will not fit! 2 missing stars because its so small, it barely fits on a tiny wrist.EDIT: I wouldn't get this thing if you are going to be wearing it while doing ANYTHING active... went out to a movie and it broke. it is unwearable now. Good looking but very cheaply made."
2,"Great Looks, Disappointing Quality.","These shoes have a great look, classy, modern, stylish. The first few days were uncomfortable, which is typical for dress shoes, but they eventually became acceptably comfortable.The reason this review is 2 stars is the shoes started ""sqeaking"" as soon as they were broken in. Also, the shoes only lasted about 3 months of frequent use before the sole started seperating from the shoe. I got the sole repaired twice, but after 9 months the upper seams started coming undone as well.I will buy Kenneth Cole shoes again, but for this price I'm hoping some of the other models will last a bit longer and be a bit quieter."
1,"Bad sound quality, bad educational experience, don't bother","I'm deeply disappointed about this product as the sound quality of the dominant voice is clear but the follow-up voice in the other language is hardly audible. There's this ""artsy"" music playing, which makes it all even more difficulte to hear/understand. The educational framework in which this is presented is unclear at best, as there's no explanation or instruction given. There's the booklets, but you might as well go on-line and have your computer read out aloud a Russian language webpage to you.In short ""Don't bother about this product."""
5,excellent,"i consider myself a huge weezer fan, which means that i absolutely despised their last 2 efforts, and only half-despised the green album. pinkerton might be their best effort, then again, its hard to put it too far ahead of the blue album. it is not quite a concept album, but the title, and at least the song ""butterfly"" refer to the opera ""madame butterfly"", as a sort of metaphor for rivers' relationship at the time. the thought and effort put into this album by rivers and the band is immeasurable. this is one of my top 5 favorite albums, and i never get tired of it."
5,Pinkerton is AMAZING,"I don't know why Rolling Stone would name this album the worst album of the year, they must have had their heads up their asses! Weezer's second album ""Pinkerton"" is a classic album, along with their first album entitled ""The Blue Album"". After Rivers Cuomo trashed his unknown album (which is now entitled ""Songs from the Blackhole"" by the fans which was supposed to be a rock opera.) He took songs from his rock opera including Tired Of Sex, Getchoo, and Why bother to put onto Pinkerton. He then added other songs which he had written within that time period.Pinkerton mixes hard rock guitar riffs (with feedback) and emotional lyrics to express himself on this album. It may not sound like the blue album but this album has it's own unique sound. This album is one 90's rock classic that everyone should own."
3,a little different,"Because the album addresses more common issues, and is not ridden through with sarcasm/fun (depending on your point of view) like the first one; it seems a little less unique and more usual. It is still excellent musically, but the content is a little different."
3,"Good, but not great","I'm a big Weezer fan. Maladroit was my first Weezer cd, and I loved it. When I got Pinkerton I got less than I expected. I enjoyed listening to Tired of Sex, El Scorcho, The Good life, and Pink Triangle. However Across The Sea was too bland, Why Bother? was a good song, but was way too quick, and No Other One had a terrible beat. Not to mention, I hated Butterfly, which is the only Weezer song I've ever said that about. If you're a Weezer fan, you'll enjoy it."
1,Extremely disappointing.,"Well, Weezer's debut album is one of my favorite CD's, and because of this, I was excited as heck to go out and buy Pinkerton. I had to go to three stores to find it, and when I did, I was overjoyed. ""Yay, more good Weezer music!"" I thought. Well, I got out to my car, ripped open the package, and put the CD into my car stereo.Instead of hearing lyrical and musical masterpieces I heard in the first album, I heard a bunch of simple, unappealing racket. It's difficult to explain the sound, but it seems as though Weezer was going for something different and it just didn't work out for them. On top of all this, the lyrics are sappy and lovey. I suppose a lot of people might like that, but that's something I pretty much loathe. I can take one or two sappy love songs, but a whole album! Argh.Anyhow, I absolutely love Weezer's first album, but this one just didn't work out for me."
5,blows me away every time,"This cd (along with the self titled debut) is awesome. Each song is catchier than the previous one. Cuomo has a talent to put together beautiful little rhymes and put in a touch of humor into meaningful songs. Weezer is one of my favorite bands and the only fault i can find on this disc is that practically every song is a love song, which can get boring. All in all, this cd is way overplayed in my cdplayer, but i guess there's a reason to that."
4,Weezer will not top this. Buy it.,"Weezer won't do better than this record as is evidenced by the 2001 release. The 2001 ""green"" record is bland. This record rocks. The guitars sound like grinding metal (not suprising since they used power tools during recording). Buy it now if you don't have it and turn it up."
4,Weezer didn't suck after the blue album,"Pinkerton is very different from the blue album, but just as good. the songs are heartfelt and get you moving. I love to listen to this CD when I have a bad day and need and need that extra UMMPPHH! It's like hanging out with your four best guys friends."
4,Underestimated and underplayed,"Okay, let's be honest with ourselves -- The Blue Album was obviously the best Weezer release ever, and will probably remain that way forever. However, there are good things about every album by these guys, because every album seems to have its own unique sound. Pinkerton, for example, is more angst-drive and edgy than their first album. People failed to give it a chance! From the frustrated openings of ""Tired of Sex"" and ""Why Bother"" to the in-your-face wailings of ""El Scorcho"" (which happens to be one of my favorite weezer songs) and ""The Good Life"" to the quiet reminiscance of ""Butterfly"" the CD rocks and rolls and should definitely not be passed up. This is a must-listen for any weezer fan or music lover."
5,Weezer Addiction...,"Pinkerton is an amazing album. I cannot take it out of my cd player. If you like Weezer, this is the one you have to buy. Yeah, Blue was pretty good, Green was ok, but this one is by far the best. Rivers apologized for this album, and I cannot begin to imagine why. Green was too PopRock for me, Pinkerton has real feeling and emotion. Everything he says is something that I can relate to. The songs have so much meaning to them, and apologizing for this was wrong. Apologize for the PopRock Green Album, that was too shallow. If you listen to the lyrics of Pinkerton, you feel the pain that Rivers was feeling when he did this album. He was heartbroken, and nothing expresses emotion better than music. If you like Weezer, YOU MUST HAVE THIS ALBUM!"
5,"A REAL band, at last!","Congrats to Weezer for being one of the most original bands of the decade. They ignored all the trends, and still came out with pride and dignity. This cd is ALMOST as good as their s/t but it a bit shorter. My favorite tracks are El Scorcho, Tired of Sex, and No Other One. Weezer are just one of those bands that everyone can like. Whether you're a rap fan, a rock fan, it doesn't matter. Weezer appeals to all. And if you say you don't like this band then you are just lying to yourself and have not admitted the greatness that is......WEEZER! =w=. This is one of the best non-metal cd's out there, and this band will shine as one of the most memorable acts of the 90's."
5,Revolutionizing Rock Music,The history of Pinkerton is when it was first released it was thought to be horrible and that it would be the downfall of weezer who had taken the nation by force with its first album. Pinkerton is an excellent cd. It may takee some time but after the third or fourth listen you will fall in love with it. Pinkerton is definetley a must have.
3,THE EVOLUTION BEGINS,"WEEZER SHOW MOMENTS OF BRILLIANCE IN THIS SOPHOMORE EFFORT WHICH ACTS AS A PREDICTOR OF THEIR WORK ON THE GREEN ALBUM. THIS ALBUM FEATURES DELIBERATELY POORLY PLAYED GUITARS AND VOCALS AND YET IT WORKS. IT IS ANTI-POP AT ITS FINEST AND SHOWS US THE EVOLUTION OF THIS BAND INTO THE SUPERSTARS THEY ARE TODAY. IT IS WORTH OWNING FOR THE MOMENTS OF BRILLIANCE THAT SHINE THROUGH, AND AMUSING TO OWN FOR SOME OF THE LESS THAN STELLAR MOMENTS. OVERALL, A NICE EFFORT."
4,"Youthful, energetic and at the same time a little sad...","The entire album sounds like one song, but it is Weezer's unique style that makes it a good album."
1,Very dissapointing after listening to first CD,"I feel betrayed by Weezer - They did such a superb job on their first CD. It had a style all of its own. This new CD brings Weezer back into the cesspool of other manic-depressive alternative titles. Its songs are harsh, not fun like ""Buddy Holly"" or ""Undone."""
2,Worst Weezer album!,"Too bad they hit their sophomore slump so hard. The blue album was pretty good. I was looking for an improvement beyond that. But this is just annoying. I wish Rivers would have stayed in his cave for the rest of his existence. Their music just keeps going downhill. The only song that is tolerable is Pink Triangle, and maybe The Good Life. But come one, it bombed on the charts for a reason."
4,weezer is pure rock,weezer is a great rock band that can truly write great rock songs. this is a really good record. get it
3,money clip,Looks cool but screw keeps coming out and then you loose half the clip. Needs better enginering
3,"eh, its okay","...I was expecting more. He is technically pretty good. No mistakes anywhere, so its probably good for a student wanting to learn the piece, and needing a good role model or something. I think The recording is just sort of lackluster, and is devoid of the passion that a violinist should exhibit when playing any of sarasate's showpieces. THe pieces sort of serve as skeletons upon which substance should really be added. I sort of regret not holding out for a more passionate violinist (*cough* vengerov *cough*) to release the sarasate spanish dances. Oh well, another cd of mine that will do nothing but collect dust."
5,Great Investment,Caillou has not lost it's appeal even for older children. My children are ages six and nine and they both still love Caillou. We wish we could find more Caillou items but they are almost impossible to find. This show will be a favorite for our grandchildren as well. It is a great investment and a wonderful treat for the whole family!
4,Best of Jennifer Holiday Review,"I primarily purchased this item for one particular song: ""And I'm Telling You"" from the original Broadway play, ""Dreamgirls"". I thoroughly enjoyed it...just wish it was a longer song!"
2,Good while it lasts,"I have owned two of these. This dryer is the best blow dryer I have ever had, but it lasts just about a year of gentle home use. Same results with both dryers. For this price would expect it to last much, much longer. I would not call it ""professional"" quality."
1,Dont Do It!,"I am a professional hairstylist. I cant believe how crappy this deal is! Ordered my blowdryer, got it, knew it was fake almost instantly( I already own a real one), wanted to return it. I called them and told them it was fake and they said I could return it for a refund. They e- mailed a rma# and I sent it back. Well a month has gone by and they claim they havent recieved it and wont even try to help me find it. Yeah right. Total scam because I called them out for being fake. They wanted to exchange but I was adamant on a refund. I guess they didnt like that. Losers. Dont do it!"
1,Consumer fraud,"After purchasing this product from Amazon for Christmas I found out that it has NO guarantee that it would even work at all! Amazon is NOT an authorized seller,therefore NO guarantee! Talk about consumer fraud! This should be spelled out before you make the purchase so you could make an educated decision. BESPOKE says that they are pursuing the matter in court but it's been 6 months and they are still selling them! I totally doubt their response."
1,Purchased New; Looks Used!,Product arrived very poorly packed. The item was purchased new but looks like a refurbished/used blow dryer. Will be expected damage and low or no life expectancy. Would like a new one! Very disappointed with my purchase!T3 Bespoke Labs 83888-SE Special Edition Evolution Professional Ionic Ceramic Tourmaline Hair Dryer
1,A customer service nightmare,"Purchased this for my daughter. She loved it! 55 days later when it quit the story makes a U Turn. Getting in touch with customer service is next to impossible. I have finally received two emails with two different answers, this took seven business days! To expensive to have this lack of service. Buy a different brand!"
4,superb overview on eastern religions and their implications,"An inpiring journey through eastern perennial philosophy by the man who could turn out to be the most important thinker of the twentiest century. In the last year of his live Campbell gave one more lecture tour so that it could be filmed and reproduced. This one series of five is obviously his favourite subject. Inspiring, informative and amusing..."
3,Wasn't overly thrilled with this one,"Of the 16 Barney tapes I've purchased for my son, this one doesn't get a 4 or 5 star rating. It's decent and cute but nothing to write home about."
5,Changed the way I think!,"Thank you Mary Kay Ash for writing the words that I needed to read! Mary Kay's ideas may seem old fashioned to some, but I found them to be refreshing. It's nice to be reminded once in a while that God and Family should come before Career. This book is an inspiration to all women (not just those who like cosmetics and skin care) who want to be the best they can be at whatever it is that they do. The book will keep all women grounded!"
5,Your Really Can Have it All,"With the right priorities (God, Family, Business) you can have it all. Read how a successful business woman broke out of the accepted mold, built her own business and gives you the tools to build your own. I find it amazing that Mary Kay put forth this model over 45 years ago and some corporations are still looking for it. The advice and wisdom in this book will help you reach your goals, whether as an Independent Beauty Consultant or just starting your own business."
3,Much Too Long,"I was very excited to see Daniel Deronda because of Daniel falling for an impulsive acting girl in the 19th century was sure to be dramatic but I was wrong. This story was too long not to be juicy but it fizzled bad. Daniel spent the whole movie trying to find himself because he ended up disappointed by Gwyndolen who married the wrong man on impulse. Being that this was 2 discs, I expected a little more."
1,A VERY painful Experience,"I love BBC miniseries, like Pride and Predjustice, Berkeley Square, Wives and Daughters, just to name a few. But this was torture to watch. It is so overly dramatic it's like watching a poor high school play. I didn't care about the characters and the plot (if in fact there had been a plot) was so slow ... so slow and disjointed. If this were going to be a story about the Jews returning to their homeland, I would have loved to see that. If it were going to be a story about British aristocracy, I would have enjoyed that too. I Don't understand how the other reviews for this movie are so high. I would not recommend this to anyone."
5,Brilliant work of art,"This production is one of the best I have ever seen. It has a wonderful love story, a philosophical quest, a story of changed people and redemption, and a search for meaning in life. The performers are true professionals and are all excellent. The costumes and scenery are beautiful, and the ending of the movie is very gratifying !"
2,It had promise,"I enjoyed this movie..but halfway through, it became utterly boring and depressing. I finished it but hated the ending and I was left wanting something a little lighter and happier. The cast was A+"
4,very good,"Great for learning in the car. Sometimes the speakers go a bit fast, but it was much more enjoyable than grammar drills. I wish there was a level 2 set I could buy!"
5,a 12+ ? year old's opinion of one cute dog demon!!,"In this latest issue of inu yasha, inu yasha FINALY has a rival for the love of Kagome. I mean, there were SO many love rivals in Ranma 1/2, you think Inu would have had one by now!And the new smaller, cheaper version of the series is a huge improvement. (I can afford it now!!)And this book is just genuinly good! The last few pages are especialy engaging, when Kagome goes home... again.Anyway, in my opinion it's the best book so far. I HIGHLY reccamend it."
3,bought it for 1 song,"I only bought this cd for the song ""Love Rollercoaster"" performed by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. This is one of my all time favorite songs so the cd was worth it to me. I don't like any of the other songs on the disc."
2,Doesnt make sense,"If you've seen the show, you know that Beavis & Butthead would never buy this album. Other than zombie, ac/dc, and ozzy, itsjust a soundtrack fit for a different show. They missed the opportunity to really put out a soundtrack of good metal/hard rock anthems. The only reason I bought it is for the red hot chili peppers track, which rocks and was the best of that year."
3,"Good educational toy, needs supervision","The calendar is sturdy and the pieces are well made for the price. The one thing that I don't like about this toy is that I feel like I have to monitor my kids (3 & 4) playing with it. The magnetic dates and activities are tiny, and I'm worried they will get scattered around the house rendering the calendar useless. Still, I like it for the price, and just keep in mind that it's something I have to sit down and do with my girls."
3,Love Mr. Tutt,"I've enjoyed Arthur Train's stories of Ephraim Tutt (Mr. Tutt) for fifty years, ever since I was a boy. Many appeared in the ""Saturday Evening Post"", and the series was very popular. I read this one somewhere along the way. This is a book of stories about his law firm in New York. (Samuel Tutt (Tutt) was either a partner or a subordinate. This was a firm with the approximate ethics of ""The Practice"", which would take any case that walked in the door. Lots of humor. It would make a good TV series."
4,Surprisingly Good Movie!!!!!,"I never thought I would say this but the movie was actually pretty good. I was alittle skeptical about watching it after seeing ""Soul Plane"" but I must say its worth watching."
1,TOO SCARY!,"BEWARE! This is packaged as a fun little girly girl sleepover and it is a MONSTER STORY. The girls turn into monsters and it is good for night mares. Moms, you might wanna preview before you let kids watch this one."
1,Disc did not include Kidz Fairy Tales,"I ordered this two disc combo but the only show included was Kidz Sleep Over. The Fairy Tales show was not included, either on separate disc or on the disc with the Sleep Over show. I have one very disappointed child and this disappointed parent. Would have saved a couple bucks by just ordering the one show."
1,Don't bother,"Like I said, don't bother. I forgot what I saw soon after seeing it. Let's see I need a few more words. Done"
2,Don't Bother,"Boring, inane plot with a ""heroine"" who is so self-centered and shallow you wonder why you are bothering to read another word about her. Try Perri O'Shaughnessy's books instead."
2,Anyone else have this problem?,"My husband works outdoors and was using this product faithfully on face, neck and arms. I can't be in the room when he sprays it but the smell goes away pretty fast so that wasn't a big deal. The big problem was his T-shirts would be stained orange at the neck and where they touched his upper arms. Scrubbing reduced the stains but wore out his shirts. Maybe it was a body chemistry thing. It kept him from burning but ruined his shirts so he no longer uses it.Has anyone else had this happen?"
2,Predictable and boring,"A very good friend that knows of my admiration for irish literature gave me this book as a present. Although my predisposition was the best, it was terribly hard even just to end it. I found it boring, uninteresting, dull and full of easy literary cliches. My friend told me it is regarded as an outstanding book in the second half of twentieth century literature in Ireland, but I only managed to finish its less than two hundred pages out of sheer stubborness.Sure Mr. McGahern writes well, but in my opinion it is not only that that counts."
3,Nothing really new here,"First of all, in this day and age how can a book be published with this many grammatical errors!!! C'mon Masterson, at least hire a great editor for the second printing, if it makes it that far. As far as the material goes, same ole stuff you read in every other leadership book, just different stories. I'm not mad that I bought this book, just sorta bored with all the same stuff out here. I'm sure without your e-zine this book would never have made it this far, stick to what you know best, marketing."
5,One of the dopest!!!,Truly one of the greatest albums of all time... of any genre... period! Just listen!
2,a film to hate or to love,"I must admit that I had read those two very positive reviews (posted on Amazon.co.uk) before I decided to watch ""Buffering"". Full of enthusiasm I pressed the play button and?The plot is as simple as every teen comedy, so don't expect too much. In this case we have two gays, no cash, but a cam and LAN and a lot of energy to burn in bed. I spare you details.Jokes? Well, they circulate around one subject (sex) and aren't particularly elaborated.Acting - so so. I liked the girl. The owner of sex-shop seemed the most experienced of all.In my opinion it's one of those films, that viewers will fall in love with or loathe it.Judge for yourself."
2,gay movie with straight sex,"Good story, pretty good acting and production values. But adding straight sex scenes into a gay film ruined this one for me. That's not what I want to see, it just grossed me out!"
5,love this pan!,"I've owned a Magnalite for 20 years or so, and my son-in-law kept asking for recipes for my roasted meats, mainly ham, and I kept telling him it was the pan, nothing else I did. I bought him one for Christmas this year! They are different from any other roasting pan--amazing results!"
1,Lid did not fit,"How could you go wrong with a magnalite roaster. They have been the roaster of choice for years in my family. The 15"" roaster I received was defective. The lid did not fit the roaster! How can that happen?"
3,"unexpected! I found it in ""sample music""","How delightful - Microsoft gave a freebee that is real neat! Under ""Sample music"" I discovered King Suny and his African Beats! 9 great sounding songs worth from Synchro Series! Cool!"
1,All plants died,"I loved this item at first, but unfortunately if I wanted the moisture to be maintained, the flap had to be shut, which killed all my plants because of lack of oxygen. Great for the price, but not worth the trouble."
5,Nice Greenhouse,I needed a portable greenhouse for my back patio that would be useful and aesthetically pleasing. I am very happy with this greenhouse.
3,Good for Starters,"I bought 2 thinking I (or my husband) wouldn't have to lug my plants from our porch to the greenhouse as we (he) does every year! What was I thinking...Putting it together wasn't a problem but read the directions carefully. Overall it's pretty flimsy. For small pots & starters it would be great, they have no weight to them. Anything else forget it. We had a wind problem too but we fixed that by anchoring them to the porch with bungee cords. Don't put any weight on the shelves they will buckle or tip. My husband made some shelves out of light outdoor plywood and I put those over the screen ones that worked fine. We had a pretty good cold snap for a few days (cold for my part of TX nothing to the rest of the country!) and most of my plants didn't make it. Don't let your plants touch the plastic or they'll get frost burn like mine. Overall we'll lug our plants to the greenhouse this fall. And I'll donate my little ""green houses"" to our local 4H Club!"
4,This is a good (as in adequate) seedhouse,"This is more a ""seedhouse"" than a ""greenhouse"".... but, along with four Home Depot's Jiffy-72 peat pellets trays it helped me get going down the trail to a spring garden. This Gardman unit is on the light frail side and tad overpriced BUT no regrets... it works and I am a happy planter. HOWEVER, if there is one thing that Gardman is serious missing it is putting in some black zip ties to hold down the shelves. They will (guaranteed) slide out from underneath you if they are not secured down ... But do get it to get a head up on spring planting. Recommended."
1,cheaply made. falls apart,"My roommate bought this greenhouse for me as a birthday gift this spring. I received it and immediately put it to work! (late April, 2012) Initially I was estatic because it seemed perfect for my needs and, while I was very careful not to overload it, seemed very sturdy.It was late June that it disintegrated on me. The hard plastic shelves actually seemed to have ripped under the weight of a few herb seedlings. It was outside, but located in a shaded spot.I have contacted Gardman. They have not responded.Bad product. Bad customer service. Spend your money elsewhere."
2,Not pleased,"I was looking for a small outside(for the sun) greenhouse to start seeds and bulbs. This one is very light and will tilt over with the lightest amount of wind. My seeds and plants were a mess with dirt all over the place and the wind wasn't even mentioned on the news(thats how mild it was). The stand itself was broken on the bottom and now it leans. I would not recommend this to anyone unless you like picking up dirt, and replanting the same seeds over again. We put bricks at the bottom, and moved it to a less open location hopefully this will work."
2,""" AND GOD CREATED DUCK TAPE""","We own 4 of these units. They are very light weight and fairly sturdy. However, the zippers on all but 1 of them has broken and we have to use tape, to seal the plastic. We have been very careful not to abuse these poor zippers in any way. Yet these zippers have not held up. Thank God for Dock Tape."
5,great product,"Love this. It's amazingly sturdy, and snaps together in about 15min. I did discover, after the first one, it's easier if you either put the shelving pieces together first, then stack them, or give a gentle tap with a hammer as you go so the one you just finished doesn't come loose while you're working on the next section. No tools (except hammer, and a stronger person might not need that), no screws.......super easy. I am VERY pleased with this product."
3,Just not the same,"This album was a disappointment for most who bought it at the time it was released. Let's face it, there is no 10,000 Maniacs without Natalie Merchant. However, several years on now - you put it on and realise that there are a number of well written songs and it maintains the instrumental and production quality of Our Time In Eden."
2,...,"one should only purchase the CD 'Used.'""Ruins"" is lacking! Contains Rather Drab and Dull lyrics.Vocals ARE uninspired.Yes, Many of the five Star Reviews are fromMARY WORSHIPERS, or, those who work(ed) for 10kM!Thank God Mary Ramsey was asked to leave the Maniacs."
3,"A bland, disappointing effort","It's been said before, and I'll say it again--Mary Ramsey is no Natalie Merchant. It's really not Ramsey's singing that is the problem, it's her songwriting. Most of the songs sound like bland, lifeless Wilson Phillips rejects. Gone are the distinctive melodies and lyrics which Natalie did so well. Aside from the excellent ""Green Children,"" each song sounds exactly like the next. It is very difficult to get through this entire CD without tiring of it."
4,Sci-fi + T&A = Space Oddity!,"I love this DVD! Well, to be honest, I've only watched it with the filmmaker's commentary on, but trust me, you aren't missing much!David Friedman sits down with video distributor Mike Varney (sp?) to discuss the making of this obscure ""nudie cutie,"" and Friedman is none-too-hesitant to call it the worst film ever made. He's not far off. As stated before, watching the movie without the commentary is needless, there's nothing to it really. Lots of T&A, some space ship models and some very bare sets (no pun intended). The stories that Friedman and Varney recount are the best part, from the history of the theaters this type of movie played in, to how Friedman got around the legalities of using the Starship Enterprise in this celluloid schlock.If you're a fan of bad sci-fi or T&A flicks, this is a definite must!"
3,Disappointed,"This book will be appreciated by readers who want to ride up on a ski lift and then start hiking, because most of the hikes in the book begin that way. It's an efficient way of getting up out of the valley and into the high country, instead of hiking up a set of steep switchbacks. We have hiked in the French areas described in the book and have ridden the lifts several times (as many hikers do), but we prefer to hike in more remote, wild areas without ski lifts. Most of the French towns the authors recommend are fashionable ski resorts made up of modern hotels, without the charm of authentic Alpine towns and villages. Other hiking guides are available in English that concentrate on hiking away from the resorts and lifts, where you get to the trailhead by a road or a ""navette"" (shuttle bus)."
1,NEVER RECEIVED IT!,I NEVER RECEIVED THE PRODUCT. I CHOSE STANDARD SHIPPING. I FOUND IT AT THE LOCAL BARNES AND NOBLE BOOK STORE. THE REASON THAT I PURCHASED IT ON LINE WITH YOU WAS THAT EARLIER ON BARNES AND NOBLE DID NOT HAVE IT.VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS EXPERIENCE. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT I CAN GET MY MONEY BACK. I EMAILED THE BOOK DIPOSITRY WHERE IT CAME FROM AND THEY SAID THAT THEY COULD NOT SHIP IT OUT AS OVER NIGHT SINCE I DIDN'T GET IT BY STANDARD. SO I HAVE PAID 2-3 TIMES AS MUCH FOR TWO MAPS.
1,Terrible and not in the good way !,All I can say is WOW ! I'm a big fan of the series but that is 70 minutes of my life I want back ! Terrible horror movies can be great and entertaining but this is just crap on every level.
1,Sleep away camp 4,"This is a complete rip off!!! All it is, is a peiced segment of all the sleep away camps!!! Oh, and a half naked girl just sitting on a dock!!! Its not a movie at all. Dont buy this!!!!!!!!!"
3,I love sleep away camp but....,"I am a HUGE sleep away camp fan. That being said, I gave it three stars. All this movie was is a montage of the other three that appeared to be VHS quality. Their we're about 5 new ""snips"". A girl in a bikini on a doc a couple times and a weird chase with some ranger guy in the end. It made no sense whatsoever. But, I am such a nerd who has watched the three predecessors so many times ( in the 100's) the montage was cool and the childhood VHS memories were neat. For anyone who is not SERIOUSLY die hard DO NOT waste your money. Sorry sleepaway camp, please please please forgive me."
2,Ok on the countries it covers,"This book is ok.I'm living in Prague now, and plan to travel eastward. It has helped me in Slovakia and Hungary and the Czech Republic.The problem is that I want to travel to the Balkans...romania, bulgaria, and croatia are the only places covered in this book. The rest of the Balkans are completely not in there.Also, it would be nice to put Greece in the Eastern Europe book as well as the western. I know it isn't thought of as Eastern, but the Geography kind of makes it a good place to visit while going through the Balkans.P.S. Prague is NOT a trainwreck!!! I live here, and enjoy every minute of it. I'm sorry if there are tourists here, but you will run into tourists everywhere. If you are looking for a local experience, get out of Wen. Square and Mala strana!"
4,Getting hooked on Spenser,"I listened to the unabridged audio cassette of this book, while traveling around town. I prefer not to get the condensed versions of the books where you miss the development of the story and characters and get only the basics. While this book did get a little too sentimental, I have to say that it was for the better. To get the insight into Spenser and how he feels in lieu of always getting the stony detective that defeats all his enemies and solves the crime was interesting. I thought the story itself was intriguing. Okay it wasn't as complicated as plots can be, but I definitely didn't find my interest wandering. I have read one Spenser book and listened to a couple of others on tape, and I have to say that this book will keep me going. If you haven't read or listened to a Spenser book before I do not feel that you will be lost out jumping into this one."
4,Very Pleasant,"I really enjoy the sounds that the Glass Armonica produces, I enjoy listening to the cd while Im driving, very soothing."
2,A disappointing book,"I have always been interested in polar exploration. I enjoyed ""Andree's Story"" and looked forward to this book. But I found the author's pretentious and unscientific style (every third word is I, and he goes on ad nauseam about his archaeologocial expertise and the fact that he visited Danes Island) quite distracting.Still, if you are interested in the topic and if you want to learn more about Walter Wellman's expeditions, this book may be for you."
4,great upgrade for the Senseo,I bought the larger tank for my senseo because i felt like I constantly had to add water to the orgininal tank. I'm really glad I did since the larger tanks holds much more water and is easy to fill. Also it's very discreet - I don't really notice the difference cosmetically. I would recommend it to anyone who loves their senseo coffee as much as I do!
1,kids next bore!,i agre with most of the other reviewers with how bad and stuped this show is! all its about is these dumb kids who fight grown ups and go on stuped and pontless adventres! they r stuped too! this show is sucks!!!!
4,Outdated DVD,This DVD is outdated...it is the old version they used to make with the cardboard cover. I'd like to request a newer version being released by Cartoon Network!
3,"Ok CD, but not gangsta enough","I agree exactly with the other review. The tight hardcore Gangsta beats are the AWOL albums. Get Laroo ""Fear No Fate,"" that's his best work. ""Ghetto Perfection"" is good too but not as good as his first album. The beats are soft in this album but the lyrics are coo. For Lil Ric get his old albums, like ""Deep in the Game,"" (old school No Limit sytle) and Wicked Streets (Funky Groove) and his best album ""It's like Armaggedon."""
2,Not Very Useful,"This book is fine for someone who is already organized, knows where everything is, and just wants a more streamlined approach to schedules and time management. I may use some tips for organizing closets, etc, but there was very little useful information to help me get motivated. Just reading the book lets you know that Emilie Barnes is born organized."
4,This book is a GREAT Reference Book!!!,"I have read this book, and to tell you, I was very satisfied with it! It gives some great advice all throughout the book!"
2,Not too impressed,"I don't know. I think this item is kinda flimsy - not sturdy. It's a good idea, but I wouldn't trust it with any expensive bottle of wine. Mine toppled over and the wine bottles that I had stored in it broke all over the floor. And yep - it was, unfortunately, red wine.After that, (about 2 weeks of use) I folded it up, placed it back into the box, and sold it on eBay.It's worth about $4.00, not $12.00.I would bypass this rack and get yourself a better quality rack."
1,You only get half of what the picture shows...,"Product Features: ""Innovative, modular wine rack; holds 4 bottles"". Picture affirms this. What I received was half of what the picture shows. So the product I got can only hold 2 bottles of wine, which makes the rack itself, pretty pointless. I've never encountered this before where the seller blatantly lies about the product they're selling; I won't be giving them any more of my business!"
4,Works as advertised,"This little wine rack does a great job of holding 4 bottles in as little space as possible. I use it to organze my white wines in the fridge. I had to adjust the shelves to accommodate the height, but now the bottles stay where I put them even when I bump into them. No more rolling off the shelf."
5,A MEMORABLE KEEPSAKE VOLUME,"Famed photographer Louis Faurer, who died last year at the age of 84, is remembered for his inimitable fashion photos and arresting street scenes. With camera at the ready he traversed New York City streets, searching for the moments he wished to preserve.The child of a blue-collar Philadelphia neighborhood, Faurer taught himself photography. As a young man he went to New York City, where he became friends with and influenced Robert Frank. For almost two decades he devoted himself to work for top fashion mags, such as Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. Hollywood beckoned, and he served for a time as set photographer.Faurer's skill as a portrait artist is manifestly apparent in his study of Walter Winchell, and Andy Warhol star Viva. Nonetheless, the New York street scenes are his most lasting legacy.An award-winning writer and lecturer, Anne Wilkes Tucker has assembled a memorable keepsake volume for those who appreciate the art of photography.- Gail Cooke"
3,Weird behavior with scale.,"This scale has weird behavior. I weighed myself with my clothes on to get a reading of X. Then I got down to my boxers and weighed myself again. Once again it said X! My clothes must weigh more than 0 lbs! I put on my clothes again and once again it said X. Then I held a full mouthwash bottle and it said (X + 2lbs). Fine. No bottle, no clothes, (X - 2) Interesting... That means the scale can only create a new weight if the new weight is more than ~2lb difference than the original weight. At least this is based on my experience. Another weird behavior is if you stand on the scale, the weight will lock in. So if someone hands you a 5lb weight while you are on the scale, the weight doesn't change on the display!! I think these two behaviors are what other reviewers are alluding to. Once you get over these oddities, the scale appears to be very accurate and useful."
1,Garbage,I weigh about 225lbs (Doctors office scale and gym scale agree) This scale is always about 7-15 lbs over my actual weight. That would be somewhat tolerable if it was consistent. This scale will fluctuate 5-8lbs from stepping off and stepping back on. Not to mention that it takes two step ons to get it to read anyway or else it gives you an error 0 (scale cant 0 weight) or error 1 (scale cant determine your weight). Complete garbage.
1,Utterly doesn't work,I wish I would've realized this thing was defective sooner so I could return it. It has been stuck on the exact same weight for 2 months... Don't buy this disaster.
1,Stopped working,"After a week, the reading on the scale started doing its own thing.My weight started decreasing by a phenomenal amount every time I step on the scale.No one in my household comes close to 350 lbs. So it could not of been misused.What amaze me it comes with a life time guarantee."
4,Great tool for multisport,"I have been using the T3 and GPS POD for few months right now and am very satisfied. The watch is great, slim design with lots of functions but might be tricky to remember how to access all. One flaw of the watch is the cheap plastic that is easily scratched.For the GPS POD, everything is fine (small, light) except that it can take some time to get a satelite signal and that the battery life is rather short (about 10h).Overall conclusion: great tools!"
2,Not a big fan,I'm sure the noise will keep bears away from you but get used to the sound. Even when you get the magnet perfectly aligned it will drop the ball at the slightest shaking.
4,Bear bell,Simple and to the point. Good idea for extra bear protection. The magnet really does keep it quiet when not in use. Weighs practically nothing.
3,One fatal mistake,"Don't get me wrong! This is a very good book. But it containswhat is, in my opinion, a fatal mistake that brings into question the entire credibility of the author. In page 83 of the paperback edition, it states ""...the research of an Italian doctor, Cesare Lambrusco. This name, Lambrusco, is repeated two lines down and also in the Index. Mr. Bodenhamer had, I believe, Cesare Lombroso in mind, the founder of the so-called Criminal Anthropology, as anybody having taken intro criminology would tell you. The problem is that the mistake shows such sloppiness as to cast a negative shadow on every and all assertions of fact contained in the book. How can one know whether dates, names, constitutional cases, etc. are correctly identified? One cannot. If a student made such a mistake (and only that mistake) I would not hesitate in flunking him."
5,Gets the Job Done!,"These nail clippers work great for my medium-sized dog. I also very much like that these come with the nail file and quik stopper. The file is comfortable to hold and works well. I haven't made my dog's nails bleed to date, so I can't comment on the powder stuff. I just wish it came with extra blades!"
3,Was sent petite clippers.,"I ordered what was stated as nail clippers for medium to large dogs in the description. What I received was nail clippers for small dogs. I have a Pit Bull so needless to say that her nails are fairly large. Lucky for me, the clippers cut right through her nails with out hurting her or breaking the nail and making it rough. The blades are sharp no doubt but using them on her larger nails, I am not sure how long they will last. So, I have rated 3 stars because the clippers did do the job, but I was sent the wrong product."
4,"Good Product, needs sharpening","I recieved the trimmers very quickly. They did need sharpening though. My puppy got right into my lap and was very calm throughout the process. I loved that the trimmers did not make a loud ""snap"" noise like most trimmers do. The grip is very comfortable and the file is awesome. Really good product. Would be five stars if came sharper. It also came with a great booklet with a detailed (pictures) of what to do."
3,"Well, they'll outlast Third Eye Blind","This doesn't measure up to their debut--it occasionally falls into the whininess that ""August and Everything After"" toyed with, but it proves that this band isn't just one of the run-of-the mill pop acts like Hootie and the Blowfish, the Gin Blossoms or Third Eye Blind. There is a gravity to the Crows' music that is absent from that emptyheaded song-manufacturing; while that gravity occasionally weighs too heavy on this album, it also salvages it from the ashbin, which is where the likes of Matchbox 20 and the other Crows imitators are headed. The album contains two bona fide classics--""Goodnight Elizabeth"" and ""A Long December""--and it speaks well of them that neither song would have fit very nicely on their debut. There is sonic development here that many contemporaries would never play at, and it seems that the Counting Crows are on their way to residence in rock 'n' roll's upper echelon."
3,Disappointing,"This is not a bad album, but I had high expectations after their great debut, and was quite disappointed."
3,worth $4.99 even if you're sick of Round Here,"You probably didn't bother buying this album back in 1996 since by that time you were so burned out on the folksy-blues-rock of the Counting Crows that you couldn't take it anymore. After a monster-smash album of stuff that sounded all the same, this one was a breath of fresh air. IfAugust & Everything Afterwas like the annoying country-western bar, this is more like driving through a small town at twilight."
3,"""Okay, but only if you are a devoted 'Crows fan.""","This album should have been called ""'A Long December' and B-sides"". Its a fair album but the songs don't move. The beauty that the Counting Crows had on 'August and Everything After' has either been lost or has been done away with. I gave this album a three because some of the songs are boderline good but none, except one, have the power of songs such as ""Sullivan Street"" ""Raining in Baltimore"" and ""Round Here"". ""A Long December"" is the only exception. This song is a picture of what I think the Crows are. Its just too bad they lost it with the rest of the album. If you like the Crows style you will like this album. If you wanted 'fresh' songs, then this is not the album for you."
5,My Personal Favorite Crows album,"I think this is the strongest effort from the band. Just has a great collection of songs and keeps up a good pace, something that is lacking on the band's other albums. Has more rocking tunes and less slow quite one's. Not neccesarily a really great album but it's a good showing for a talented band's second release. I'd reccomend it to just about anyone, if you're already an owner of the band's other releases or are just getting into them I would reccomend getting this release."
1,BAD DISC,In the worst band of the century competition I nominate Third Eye BLind. A close second would be this horrible band.
4,Dispelling the Myths of Dissociation,"No stranger to the field of dissociation, the author has conducted systematic research and written on the subject for 20 years. This book is superb, accessible for everyone, informative, and beautifully written. It unveils the mysteries of dissociation, as well as its compassionate and effective treatment. It will help the readers to view the spectrum of dissociative behaviors that are perplexing and have been dismissed or denied by some; this book offers heightened understanding without the usual overdramatization."
4,A Story/Therepy Session that will make you cry!!!,"This book was absolutely Fantastic! At first, the book was kind of, well, boring. It starts out as a therepy session for a kid and his life on the streets. The whole book is therepy sessions from Dr. Beatrice Sparks and Samual Gordon. When you hear his storys, they are really deep. I cant tell you what happened to Sammy, but I can assure you, it wasn't pretty! You'll have to read this book for yourself."
1,Help!!,"This book is terrable! I thought it would be a neet story, well I was wrong it was the most boring book that was a recording of a boys therapy visits and it goes on and on about how he hates life and hates everything and everybody until at the end everything is solved and he is Mr. Happy Face! Then it is over. So don't waste your money"
1,riri@ (stupid!),i was looking at this book and thought i would well look at its comments and boy am i lucky i did not buy it but i have a sample uhhhhh! ( i am going to try to delete that )!
1,This book SUCKED!!!,"I thought I was reading a book that was trying to scam me into buying hypnosis tapes!!! When I started the book I hoped I could make it past the fake teenager, but the 20 pages of being hypnotized completely lost me. Don't waste your time on this one!"
2,Not Good for RV Awning,"The length of wire between lights is way too short for hanging from an RV awning. All 10 lights stretch out over the length of 3 ordinary lights. You'd need 5 sets of these to have lights the width your awning, and even then they wouldn't hang down correctly."
3,not a string!,"While it works and looks OK, beware this is not a ""string"" light as described. It's a loop, therefore has only the one plug, and cannot be incorporated into a string with other lights."
2,flawed,"The red cover for the Antlers is a thin piece of cheap plastic with the velvet infused to it, that reminds me of a disposable plastic cup. It does not allow for much variance in antler size. I had to bend this cover, and cut it. to make it fit kind of sloppy. The kit would have been better served if it had a piece of foam, and a seperate piece of cloth( velvet) in which to drape over it. The tacks to hold this cup down bent on me as I tried to push them in.I will not buy this product again."
5,better than expected,The filter came in a very manageable box with all parts tucked neatly inside. I opened the box and within 15 minutes had the thing put together and working properly. The first batch of filtered water took about 12 hours to filter but after that I just keep the top bucket full and I never run out of clean water. Recently there was a water main break and everyone was under a boil water order....not me!!!!! I had already about 4 gallons of fresh clean filtered water thanks to my Ceradyn.
4,Why Warner Bros. Why?,"I love the Justice League Episodes, all great ones to watch over and over again but Warner Bros., you guys have to stop this 3 episode DVD's that are being produced. You know by now that we fans only want a boxed set. You managed to do it with Batman TAS and now finally Superman TAS, the next step is simple......GIVE US THE BOXED SETS OF JUSTICE LEAGUE while the show is still hot!!"
4,Great Story - East to Watch,"There are two adventures on this DVD plus background material. This is not the great literary masterpiece that many professional film critics yearn for but it's more than good enough. This is great viewing for young and old. I'm over 50 years old and watch this DVD over and over because I want something that's relaxing, easy to watch and doesn't stimulate me to great intellectual hieghts and causes. I simply want to be entertained. There is NO bad language, no inuendo and all that... just a very well made cartoon with familiar characters and scenes. I can't wait to see more Justice League episodes."
1,sad,I ordered a NEW cd and received an old one. It was opened and has a dirty cover. I am so sad because this is a gift and I would send it back but don't want to pay shipping.
5,Just what you need when you are in need of healing,"Jesus died of your healing when he was crucified. He bore our burdens and became our source of healing. He never turned a single person away during His life on earth, He healed all who ask. This is a boo that will comfort you."
5,Sewing Kit Alex Toys,"This is very cute, perfect for a first time sewer. I bought it for a 6 year old but I think with help she will enjoy it very much. The box it comes in is very cute."
5,My first sewing kit,The kid arrived in a timely manner and was exactly as described on the site. My 5 year old is a little too young to really enjoy the sewing experience. I over estimated her physical abilities at this young age. However we have enjoyed the kit as she designs the project and I do the sewing. Many projects are included in the kit.
3,Sewing kit,Product was okay I did not send it back. But I expected more for the money. Thought the contents would have more projects.
5,Great Present!,I gave this to my friend's daughter for her 9th birthday ~ she loved it! It's perfect for the girl that wants to learn how to sew but maybe mom's not too sure... :)
3,For an older child,"I purchased this last year for my 6-year-old. She loved it but she constantly needs my help. Even a year later she still cannot sew these items on her own. Yes, the kit is well made but it didn't have nearly enough stuffing for the projects. Also, beware of purchasing this for anyone with a small child in the home. Finding needles on the carpet is never enjoyable."
3,Good quality and comfortable. But sounds not good as my image.,"This earbuds is very comfortable and good quality. It is obvious better than my old headphones. But for this price, I have not seen any outstanding character except excellent bass."
2,Sennheiser CX300-S Earbuds (Silver),"Well, I am happy with the sound quality of this product, however, I think it is way over prized. I can find similar quality products that are 5-10 times cheaper. I will not buy anything from this brand anymore.Sennheiser CX300-S Earbuds (Silver)"
2,THEY SOUND CHEAP,"These earbuds sound great if you don't mind holding them snug in your ears with your fingers. That's the only way I was able to get decent sound out of them. And that's after using all three avalible bud attachments.I have since returned them at a loss of about 15.00 dollars on shipping to and from. I am going back to my over the ear boise, a little bulky but excellent sound and no cord problems.SHELLBACKSEMPER FI"
3,Excellent sound but not very pleasant to use,"These earphones do what they are supposed to do: They produce high-quality sound and do a very good job of hiding ambient sounds. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy using them. Because they create a seal around the ear canal, they create a slight pressure in the ear. It's fairly minimal but I still found it to be annoying. The cord is of adequate length but it could afford to be a bit longer. The slightest movement or bumping of the cord is transmitted directly into the ear, so that sound becomes annoying as well. I'm going to buy a nice set of over the ear headphones instead."
4,Good inexpensive earphone,"I like the in-ear (or canal-phone, as I've heard them called) design. They form an airtight seal inside your ear, so none of the noise (aka sweet, sweet bass) leaks out. I bought these to replace my Sony MDR-EX71 (which broke), and I've been happy with them. I actually prefer them over the much more expensive Etymotic ER6i, because the CX300 is more bass-heavy and also more comfortable to wear (I found the ER6i to only be comfortable with foam tips, but those are a real chore to insert). I ended up getting a second pair of CX300, black this time, and I've been happy with those too. As other reviewers have pointed out, these can vary in price, but I'd say even at fifty dollars I'd be happy with them (I've had mine over 4 years and still enjoying them so you can think of them costing about one dollar per month)."
2,Ill fitted,"I purchased these earbuds after reading about Sennheiser's reputation. However, because of their design, any time I tried them on they would slide off my ears, so I was unable to enjoy the sound. So, I am back to my trusted Phillips earbuds, and frankly I can't tell the difference in sound quality."
4,"very good, but not great","These are nice, comfortable earbuds. I use them for the gym and walking my dog. The sound is a bit ""tinny"" with some bass absent. However, on the whole I like them and use them a lot."
2,Not as good as expected. . .,"With the Sennheiser name, I was expecting GREAT sound, because I have a pair of bulky over-the-head type that sound great. But not these! I would have sent them back, but too much trouble with Amazon. . ."
4,I couldn't find the white ones,"The missing star, is because even if I tried to locate a pair of White Sennheiser CX300, i couldn't find any.At least in any american website. I finally found them in an online store in the UK but then, for some reason they declined my card [-( .Why Sennheiser does not market their White version in America????However the sound quality is impressive, totally harmonic, and high fidelity sounds. Bass is quite what I expected, but I still have the feeling that my (now broken) Sony's Fontopia sounded just like this CX300 but with more defined Bass."
5,I'm impressed!,"I have never had the opportunity to try out the high end ear buds like shure, super fi, etc. I have only listned to the cheap junk pairs that come with a mp3 player. After reading the reviews i went ahead and bought a pair when they were 39 bucks and i will never listen to cheap pairs again.These buds are great! They fit in your ears perfectly and sounds so rich and clean.My only fault with them are the cords,i would have expected them to be a tad thicker and not easily breakable.Otherwise dont spend hundreds of dollars when you can spend 40 and have a great crisp professioan sounds from these.I cannot wait to try them out on a creative touch or a Iaudio x5 when i get rid of my junkriver h10."
3,"Interactive Atlas, Useful but not necessary","The diagrams depicted in this CD-ROM atlas are plate for plate the same as the book version. For those taking gross anatomy, Netter is a must, but don't buy this unless you have a lap top that is resistant to formaldehyde. Stick with the hard copy. There are useful options like instant quizes for terms on each page, but the diagrams are not full screen. Even on a 17"" monitor I have to squint to see details. Buy the book first and this CD-ROM only if you have the money to spare."
2,Do not buy.,"This produt is not usable for much. It does border to that I want to ask for my money back.Sorry netter, nice pictures, but sub pare presentation!"
4,The Bank,Very good movie! The principle characters were very believable and made for some thoughtful conjecture as to the reality of how banks do business.
3,Banks - love them ot hate them?,"Do not watch this movie with anyone who is finance savvy. They will be bored since they can tell that the entire story plot is fake. Some snippets of the finance modelling and chaos theory are being thrown around and it just does not stand as strong as a movie premise for someone who does economics for living, vs. someone who is not familiar with it. Half financial thriller, half morality tale - this is definitely an interesting tale of greed, loss, revenge and healing."
2,"Chipped paint, nasty smell, nothing fancy","I am not very happy with these rods. I relied on the reviews even though I did not care for the picture. How can you go wrong with 9 five stars reviws, right? Well, I am now thinking those reviews are bogus. The rods are solid iron, done well, but the paint is not staying on, it was already chipped all over all the pieces as soon as I took them out of the package (carefully), the smell is nasty, but that will air out and the design? I love simple, but this is so simple, it has nothing to it. Iron rod that is rounded at the end (hard to see from the pic). That's it. I am very disappointed in this purchase. The only good thing about these is that I have very little room between windows and the wall and these ends are so short (really nothing to them), they actually fit for my needs. I will keep them, but wish I could return them without losing a lot in shipping (they are heavy)."
4,Love this Shake,"Bought the book and then the shake mix. I'm a chocolate lover however I wasn't pleased with the chocolate version so next time I tried the vanilla and made my own chocolate taste. I mix with 1/2 c.vanilla flavored Almond milk, 1/2 water, 1/2 frozen banana (adds even more fiber), a tsp of vanilla favoring, 1 Tbsp of Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa & a couple of ice cubes. Yummy is all I can say.... did I lose weight? You bet ya, 8 pounds in about 6 wks, just in time for my daughter's wedding!"
3,This is one of the better Majipoor Novels,"This is one of the better Majipoor Novels, and far better than the single star utterly predictable first novel in this trilogy,but thats not saying very much. I always feel that Silverberg's heart isnt in this vast but rather anodyne and predictable imaginary world, which sadly comes across as patently manufactured.I notice that Silverberg said in rather disparaging fashion recently, that he has never read LOTR . He should do, a few lessons from someone whose literary skill in this area far exceeds his own wouldnt go amiss. On the other hand Silverberg is undoubtedly a great SF writer, his short story skills in the genre are peerless, though in the novel medium I would say he has been below par for the last five years, lets hope we have seen the last of Majipoor."
2,Weak suction; barely works,"The way this works is, you hook it up to an air pump, and when you hold it just right in the water, the air bubbles go up the tube and draw some water with it. The water spills into a filter, collecting the debris.I bought this hoping I could replace a messy weekly water change with a slow drip, daily water top-offs and regular gravel vacuuming (sort of a poor man's continuous water change system). Unfortunately, this vacuum doesn't provide much suction, so you have to dig the end down into the gravel and try to catch any bits floating away to make this work.The filter really does catch dirt and debris, but compared to my regular water change kit (the one with a hose that you screw onto a faucet), the process is very slow and not as effective. With the water change kit, the suction is so powerful that it knocks up a cloud of dusty water inside the ""vacuum tube"". You will get no such satisfaction with this Penn-Plax."
1,Too Many Dropped Signals,"I've had this router for about six months, and while it was quick and easy setup, it is wildly unreliable. I'm so tired of losing my connection and unplugging/resetting/restarting that I'm about to replace it already, but never with another Netgear product."
2,5 months of bliss...then a crashing halt,Same problem as many others. 5 months with no problems at all. Then it just stopped working and the power light stays on. I am waiting on my replacement and hopefully i won't have to return and post another comment in 5 months.
2,Worked well for a couple of years but just died on me! :-(,This router worked great for about 4 years but then suddenly died on me last night. :-(This is the 3rd Netgear router I've used that has died after a year or so of use.
1,DO NOT BUY!,"Purchased router which worked fine for about 2 months, then it died. Went through hassles with Netgear to get it replaced.Replacement router worked for about a year and now it died. I'm going back to Linksys and I doubt I'd ever purchase Netgear again.I strongly recommend that you DO NOT BUY!"
5,Wieless N Router,"This router is powerful, fast and easy to setup. Firmware updates are easy too if you have a PC, but difficult if you have a Macintosh. To update firmware with a Mac you must use a virtual PC operating then it becomes easy."
2,"Died, and the replacement Died","I purchased this router one year ago. Since then it has just died. I sent it back to Netgear and they sent me a new one. That took me offline for one week. Plus I had too pay for shipping the replacement router. That one died in about six months. That is two routers in less than twelve months. Good range and data rate when it works. Super fast is the only reason it got the second star. If reliability is important to you, skip it."
1,"Terrible device, terrible response","I bought one of these, and like many others here and elsewhere, mine just died. Green power light and nothing else. Tech support was absolutely no use whatsoever. No logic in their troubleshooting, and they seemed more interested in blaming my network than admitting their device had issues. If I was buying a router now and had the benefit of other peoples experience I wouldn't touch this with a 10ft pole.Honestly, if I could give it 0 stars, I would have."
1,Incurable problem,"The router works fine, when it works. My problem is that when the router re-boots, for example after a power outage, it changes it's default ip address from 192.168.1.1 to 10.0.0.1Trying to use customer service is a nightmare. If they understand you, they simply follow a script about hard reset. That does not fix the problem. Ultimately, I've re-worked my network so that my fixed ip addresses are now using 10.0.0.nnn because this device can not keep it's settings."
1,Don't Buy this Router,"This router is not reliable. I bought one, brought it home and it was doa. The replacement was not good. Fortunately I discovered this while I could still return the item. I wish I had read the other reviews before I bought the item"
5,Neatgear WN854T Wireless-N Gigabit Router,This is the 4th Netgear router I have bought over the years. It was easy to set up and has been running flawlessly for over 3 months.
1,Don't Buy a Netgear WNR854T Router!!!,"Setup was easy, after updating firmware and everything worked great for about 6 months until one day it just died.3 hours of wasting my time with tech support and some 7 days later I finally received a replacement.2nd unit setup easily but this unit seemed to like to drop the signal about once an hour. Tech support was no help, blamed my wireless card and wouldn't replace it.But the good news is the 2nd unit died today, about 3 weeks out of warranty and with that also went the only reason I haven't replaced it with a quality unit from another manufacturer!!Goodbye NetGear!!"
2,Fast but short-lived,Worked fine for almost a year and then just died. Seems that many others have had the same experience.
1,Worst router ever,I have had 3 separate routers die. All of them took over 3 months to be replaced buy Netgear. They would receive the router and not return the replacement until I called them 7 times. They all failed within 5 months of purchase. Do not buy this router unless you can not read the countless reviews of how this router fails for EVERYONE. I will never buy Netgear again based on there support. Oh and there support numbers are all unreachable from Canada now. Netgear should have a class action lawsuit against them for not recalling an obviously faulty product.
1,Short Product Life,"I bought the Netgear WNR854T wireless router 14 months ago and it stopped working a few days ago. I think that there must be a defect in the design. The warranty was only one year and Netgear Tech Support was no help. It seems like the router was designed to only last through the warranty period.I was pleased with the performance when it worked. Initially, I had difficulty getting file sharing to work with a computer running Vista. Other computers (running XP) could see the Vista computer, but the computer running Vista could only see the router. To solve this, I had to disable the router firewall. I then re-enabled the firewall and file sharing worked."
3,It works!,"This product was recommended to my by my PCP for leg cramps, at first I was in disbelief to it being effective, but it does work! The pill dissolves under the tongue and the taste is not bad at all. I would highly recommend this product for relief of leg cramps!"
2,How Much Quinine?,"I used to take quinine for extreme leg cramps; 200 - 300 mg served me well. Quinine is a little harder to come by so I tried this. But the packaging is very hazy about how much quinine is actually in the pills. Since the label is unclear and there is no after taste with the pills (quinine is very bitter) I'm confident there is very little quinine in these pills.I give the product 2 stars because there is some modicum of quinine and it does help a little with the cramps. But only 2 stars because I am frustrated (to say the least) that the description and the labeling are, in my opinion, intentionally misleading."
4,One Great Manga,In this book you find out a secret of Kaji and you find out how Shinji deals with what his father did to Toji.Very suprising.A very good book it leaves you dying to get the next.
4,Frame by Frame,"Lawrence Block's Bernie Rhodenbarr is one of the best figures in the world of detective fiction, which is illustrated by number five in this funny series. Used book seller, Bernie has sticky fingers that make him the least suspected amateur detective in the genre.The supporting players in this romp are equal to Bernie. A ransom of a Mondrian for a kidnapped cat it an outrageous beginning. This Bernie demands a good art reference to make it really shine.Block builds his characters with each installment, so going back to BURGLERS CAIN'T BE CHOOSES is a great reading trip, but each story can stand on its own.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
3,Works OK,"Works great for the first couple of weeks but quickly fades as the bag begins to fill up, which is to be expected. Not a big fan of the scent either but its better than the old pet fur scent typical of a pet owners vacuum bag."
5,Freshen the air as you vacuum!,"My daughter in law has a cat and I adore Fizzy , but she tends to scatter the litter all over which I vacuum up and then the bag smells like her litter. That is why I ordered the freshers. It leaves a nice smell in the air and I do not smell litters. Problem solved!"
2,Tough nails,"While I like the style and ease of this product I find my dog's nails are too tough for it. If I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't buy it."
1,dissapointed,This was recommended to me at the pet store when I was looking for a good nail trimmer as my old one was getting dull. The blade did not feel sharp at all and it actually cracked my dog's nail on my first couple tries. Poor thing. My old one still works better than this. grrr!
4,My kids love this game!,"After taking my two kids to see Shrek2, I bought them this computer game, and they have really enjoyed playing it. My 10 year old son seems to find the donkey especially funny, and my 8 year old daughter, who usually doesn't play as many games, has been very absorbed with this one since I brought it home. It was easy to get them started, which I appreciate, since I'm not a computer whiz, and it seems to be very consistant with the movie, which thye loved."
5,Can't beat Henkels,"I worked as a sous chef for a few years and, while these aren't knives, the steel and quality are the same. What more can I say?"
2,Don't waste you money...,"All of the shears are very cheaply made. The cutting shears for flowers are ridiculous. Small, plastic, lightweight, not a quality product at all. Considering it's ""Hencklels"", I'm very surprised at the poor quality. You would be better off to go to your local hardware or office supply store for better quality and save some money at the same time."
2,Once apon a time.......,"It used to be that Henckels products were top notch. No longer. Any fine quality knife or scissors has to be forged. I have a few old knifes from Henckels and they are fine, quality tool steel, drop forged. Now I'm not saying these are worthless just not top drawer. There are still great knifes out there just beware the sticker shock. As these will be a life long tool look at the price with a view towards that. Look at Wusthof for a good example or some of the Japanese small manufacturers or A.G. Russell, you will not be disappointed. Even if you can only afford one at a time do it. Also a great wedding gift. Duke Masters"
2,Good and Bad,"I added this Henkels International 5 piece Scissors when I purchased Henkels Pro-S 8inch High Carbon Chef's knife. The price for this 5 piece package was great considering the name value of Henkels. However, the quality of product was not even close to the same scissor I purchased 8 years ago, and surprisingly, within 2 weeks they are getting rusty on hinges.Well --- what you are paying for is what you are going to get."
3,Roache as RKF,"Movie about RFK's life and trials in politics. Linus Roache did a good job playing this part. I'm amazed at the number of English actors who take on the American accent, especially in this instance where Roache did the Boston accent. I've seen several other movies of RFK's life and times after JFK's death - this one covered the same territory."
1,Without Danzig they have nothing,This album is a disgrace to the Misfits name. Michale Graves is not even close to Glenn. 'Dig Up Her Bones' and 'American Phsycho' are the only good songs on the album. All in all this is a complete failure.
3,This is dumb fun...but fun all the same...,"When Jerry originally brought back the Misfits I refused to buy the record for a year knowing that in some small way I would find myself in a dissapointed state. Well, on a random birthday the CD was thrown into my lap and I finally decided to give it a listen. Yes folks, the wit of Glenn Danzig (as well as the extreme vocal talent) has left the building. Even so, Jerry has managed to keep the fun intact. Idiotically catchy ""woah-oh-oh"" choruses and throbbing riffs make this a musical event and a half. This is an extremely pro-qaulity-dumb-punk-metal-edged record for all the kids to love. While I didn't find myself seeing this as the most legit comeback of the time, it was certainly the most fun. While I may miss the influential vocals and intelligent wit of Glenn Danzig - this had me bopping my head along and singing with it's silly lyrics for years now. I geuss it's a victory..."
3,Good Rock Albumn,I was pleasently suprised after hearing this disc. The songs capture a lot of the old majic. Some of the old school fans won't like it but still definitly worth getting
2,Good if you like 80's metal,"This album sounds like a cheap imitation of the original Misfits. This album tries to recapture the Misfits sound by using simple and fast song arrangements, with dark lyrics and lots of ""Whoas"", but it just lacks a soul. Danzig used the influences of Elvis, B-movies, and early punk to create something original. This album just goes though the motions. It seems like Jerry Only is more influenced by 80's hair metal than Elvis or punk. The melodies are so cheesy. A real Misfits song like Astro Zombies sounds really influenced by oldies (specifically ""Blue Moon""). New Misfits songs like Speak of the Devil sound like Warrent was singing them.It's like the new Misfits are ripping off the old Misfits. The new Misfits know on the surface what makes a Misfits song, but overall it doesn't come off as authentic. Kinda like comparing Pearl Jam to Silverchair.(They still put on a great live show, though)"
4,Glenn Danzig is not a factor,"The first time I heard the Misfits, I was in 6th grade and thought that GD was the man. Well, he plays technocrap now, so let's just get off his jock and get back to the CD.American Psycho is good, campier lyrics than before but with a faster sound and wide range of vocal expression. Jerry and Glenn cannot be compared... Glenn sounds like Elvis and Jerry sounds like himself. Caught them at Ziggy's in NC in Nov of 2000. Jerry is a great guy who knows how to treat his fans."
1,Disappointed,"This was a bootlegged copy. It appeared that it was mailed to me from someone's place of business, as it was bulk mailed from a national bank like US Bank.I should have known better for the price of $.01"
1,What happened?,"I used to have a man-crush on Mike Myers, but after watching this movie he is just a silly Canadian to me.From beginning to end my wife and I kept exchanging looks of: ""What?""and ""Really?"".What happened, Mike?"
4,I DONT SEE WHY THE RATINGS SO LOW!,i really enjoyed this movie. Im a very tuff man to impress. I dont see why it didnt do that well in the box office as well as rating wise on this cite. The jokes were funny and the story was well written. It was a great movie i never got bored! i really recommend this movie. I saw it twice in 2 days. really good!
2,A low point for Mike Myers,"Is it possible that nobody actually read the script to the Raspberry Award-winning ""The Love Guru"" before heading in front of the cameras to film it? How else to explain this excruciatingly unfunny farrago of flat jokes, lame slapstick and manic overacting? Look, I'm as much of a fan of Mike Myers as the next fella`, but even he can't redeem material this worthless - and he co-wrote the thing! (with Graham Gordy, in case you're interested).In deference to its other stars - and/or victims - we'll forego identifying them here, but the writers and director Marco Schnabel should not be let off so easily.As for Myers, he hasn't looked this uncomfortable since the last time he found himself standing next to Kanye West."
4,Great value for the money,I was surprised at the quality of the tool. It's designed to last a very long time. I am very happy with it.
3,"Not sophisticated, but fun.","Hilarious! So, it isn't roller coaster tycoon. It is the same kind of funny game. Would be better if it had more scenarios, however, it is certainly worth the $4.99 I paid for it."
1,If you really want to get the best of Madness...,"Get ""Madness the business"", a 3 CD box set of their singles. Not only do you get to hear the band mature from its Swiss Cottage ""bad boy"" beginnings to its sophisticated nutty pop sound of the early 90s, but you get to hear fun commentary about the mega-band between tracks. I hear the band has recently returned to the studio. We'll see...If you're not British, you may only have a vague recollection of Madness. I consider myself to be among the music literati, and I assure you that you've missed one of the great bands of all time. Alas, like all things, the world moves on, and the ""sound"" that was so exciting and different back then is a bit thin and dated today. None-the-less, ""Madness the business"" is a must-have if you are a true collector of great music."
4,wonderful,"Wonderfully made, evenly distribution of heat. The cleaning process after cooking consume minimal time and energy. The only problem I Had was with the lid rattling and that could be contributed to steam release, but I am unsure of the cause of the rattling."
4,Sunlight vs. Slime,"Take this review with a grain of salt; there's only so much you can say about a bicycle tire without having a whole bunch to destroy for testing purposes. That said, I did buy the Slime and the Sunlight at the same time (to have an extra around) and they were almost exactly the same price.Just from the packaging, a basic examination, and my gut instincts, I want to say I'd put my money on the Slime. First, it's plastic wrapped inside a box instead of just crammed inside a barely-big-enough box like the Sunlight. More importantly, the Slime is a bit smaller in size, presumably to fit the 1.75"" diameter tires, which the Sunlight does not (their proclaimed range starts at 1.95); this makes me feel like it's more substance. That said, if you have a 2.125"" diameter wheel, you may be putting extra strain on the Slime over the Sunlight.As I said, this is just my feeling more than anything, but for something like this, I think a different perspective is worth hearing."
1,Defective,This tube exploded within 10 minutes of being properly installed and inflated. It split along a seam -- clearly it was defective. I patched the old tube and returned this one.
4,"Nice set, but...","Overall, this a decent set of throwback helmets and the display case itself is durable and fairly well made. As for the helmets themselves, there's a few that aren't historically accurate. While the Rams did use a segmented horn in 1949, that helmet was actually red (and it didn't have a facemask, but that's forgivable). The Denver Broncos '62 helmet most likely had a blue logo, not a brown one. The Patriots & Chargers helmets both should have numbers on the sides, and the Raiders '63 helmet had a silver shield, not a white one (the white shield was used in 1994 on the team's throwback uniform - it never actually existed prior to that). I think it's also just a little bit silly to have 2-bar helmets for the Panthers, Jaguars, Texans & Ravens, but maybe that's just me. With that said, this set does contain quite a few helmet designs which have become increasingly hard to find in the standard Pocket Pro style, and is thus still a nice addition to any mini-helmet collection."
2,Memoirs of a self-absorbed conceited man,"The only reason I kept reading this book was to try to fight insomnia. As Christopher Banks' character developed, I grew to dislike him so much that I wanted to see if he'd finally be put in his place. What a pompous @ss. Great demonstration of the naivety (sp?) of the Western world to anything foreign."
2,Easily Forgotten,"Not as good as Ishiguro's other works. His very best was Artist of the Floating World, followed by Remains of the Day. This book follows the career of a Shangai-raised Englishmen who becomes a detective. Like all Ishiguro's book, the narrarator has exagerated sense of formality. The sense of denial and the sort of ""elephant in the middle of the room"" truths that lead to great ending in Ishiguro's other books never materialize in this one."
2,disappointed INDEED,"The beginning is interesting and promising. The childhood in Shanhai describtion is detailed and inspiring. It was great and I was looking forward to see how all developes, being patient and coping with the time elopes. But than suddenly all clushes and becomes indeed a big mess (as the reviewer before me mentioned). The plot loses its credibility. It does not feel like surrealistic to me. It just feels like the author lets us down and the book loses its integrity. I just felt sorry for the time spent reading this stupid novel."
2,Very disappointing,"Like many of the others who have reviewed this novel I adored Remains of the Day, which is somewhere near the top of my 50 favorite books of all time. The books have similar themes - an isolated man who misses all life's cues and clues. Where they differ is that When We Were Orphans is both thoroughly tedious and quite preposterous. I notice that most people click that a review has been helpful when that review is positive. Fair enough. Don't take my word for it. But do at least try to borrow the book from the library rather than invest any money in it."
2,Frustrating read,"I admire Ishiguro for writing a risk-taking book, most unlike any I have read befire. Unfortunately, this novel fails in its objectives, except for itself being a unique piece of fiction.The protagonist is an english detective, who appears to be completely delusional about his current circumstances, and who is willing to take these delusions to great lengths. Because of this, the plot eventually becomes irrelevant to reality. This is when the book shows its signs of brilliance, when the plot is recognized as meaningless and the major themes take over in a Chinese battle.Unfortunately this brilliant culmination hardly makes up for the rest of the novel. Besides the poor/meaningless plot, the novel does not have a single character the reader cares about. The thematic sequence, during which the book finally seems to be about something, is all too fleeting. Soon after the plot returns even more absurd than before. It's a truly frustrating experience."
1,You can't judge a book by its author....,"Ishiguro can write. There is no doubt about this. However, this ability is definitely not reflected in ""When we were orphans"". This must be just about the most disappointing book I have ever read.The pace is pedestrian, the plot improbable, the naivety of the narrator and main character stupifying and the characterisations stereotyped.I wish I could be more positive!There is nothing in this book to recommend it, which is really quite amazing, given the real quality of ""Remains of the day"" and ""The Unconsoled""."
3,Disappointing,"After reading The Remains of the Day I became a fan of Kazuo Ishiguro. After reading When We Were Orphans, however, I realized that what worked in the previous novel -- an at-arms-length narration and storyboard structure -- does not work in this book. At times I almost got the feeling that it was specifically written to be a movie, for the structure reads almost like a screenplay, yet the dialogue is so weak, a total rewrite would be required. The plot is a most interesting one, but the execution is so flawed as to make one impatient for the end; not a feeling to have when settling down with a novel, especially one so eagerly anticipated."
2,I admit--I don't get it.,"OK, I admit it...I just don't get the point of the book.The prose is well written. But for what purpose? Page after page of somewhat tedious, wandering details. If I hadn't read other reviews, I would be even more baffled. I was ready for a subtle and complex book, but I guess it's too much so for me. It's not a detective story of course. Maybe it's the author's self-analysis? I dunno."
1,Simply dreadful,"I have not enjoyed a novel less than I enjoyed this one for many years. Totally unconvincing, uninteresting, and really just silly. To be avoided."
3,Convoluted plot detracts from Ishiguro's prose,"Although I love Ishiguro's writing style, the convoluted plot detracts from the overall quality of the novel. Ishiguro sets the stage well and some of the prose describing scenes in Shanghai is truly beautiful and emotive. However, the random twists and turns particularly toward the end of the novel make the story implausible and too contrived."
1,shame,"This book was never good but at least at the beginning one might have the impression that the story could evolve... well I was waiting and waiting but things went straight downhill. What is this book about? The protagonist is not interesting in any sense. At the part where he goes back to Shanghai and looks for his parents (disappeared 18 years ago and he thinks they are kept in a house still held captive) while there is actual fighting around him and thinks he found a childhood friend I thought this guy is simply insane, really a mental case and since this is a memoir of his none of which I have been reading is true. I was disappointed to find out that the writer did indeed believe that the events depicted could have taken place. The whole book is such a disappointment!"
3,a little disappointing,"I found this book rather disappointing. You know, you read the little synopsis on the back, think, ""That sounds cool,"" read the little editorial blurbs, such as,"". . .pushes the boundaries of the novel,"" or something. And I'm keeping this in mind as I'm reading. . .realizing, right, the narrator is not who he seems to be. But I was hoping there'd be more of a breakthrough or moment of realization, and there really wasn't. I got to the end and thought, all that just to find out his mom loved him all along? Geez. I wanted more detail re his career as a detective, more evidence of his skill or train of thought as a detective. I was never sure if I liked the narrator or not, he seemed pretentious and effete. . .I suppose that was intentional, but it didn't make for a very likeable guy. The best parts were his reminiscences about Akira."
1,disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this product. It was advertised as sugar free chocolate mint candy, but I could find no chocolate taste in it whatsoever. I also thought the description ""4-ounce unit (pack of 12) a little confusing. I was pretty surprised to find I paid $18.88 for a tiny little bag of candy that didn't taste all that great. No thanks."
2,A poor book,The only one important idea the book is that undeveloped countries probably dont meet the neccesary conditions to incorporate the advanced technologies. All the rest is an easy to read analysis of the world situation
2,Okay.... But Not Good Enough,"Fortunately, I got this Cd at the local $99. cents store. The songs are listenable if you were a teen or older during the eighties. While there are good songs, most of the cd is extremely bad. How much vintage eighties hit songs could Geffen might had in its repertoire? Not many. However, being that I got it for a buck, it is a bargain for me and I consider it a minor but significant treasure in my collection. The best songs belong to Quarterflash with ""Harden my Heart"", Debbie Harry's ""In Love With Love"", Berlin's ""Take My Breath Away"", Cher's ""If I could Turn Back Time"" and Asia's ""Heat of the Moment."" I don't know if it is really worth the price. There are not many recognizable songs, and most probably you may find them in a better cd.Better yet, download the songs from iTunes."
5,"A strong, well-reasoned, thought-provoking & versed account","Former professor of theology at Bethany Theological Seminary Dale W. Brown presents a powerful ethical discourse in this revised and expanded second edition of Biblical Pacifism. Professor Brown scrutinizes crucial biblical passages about peace and offers answers to disturbing questions for peace-loving Christians. A strong, well-reasoned, thought-provoking and versed account, Biblical Pacifism is highly recommended reading for devout Christian pacifists, as well as those seeking to come to grips with a Christian perspective of the relationship of war and religion."
5,A classic that is very relevant today,"I originallay read (and wrote a paper about) Checkland's ideas in 1990 whilst I was studying for my MBA. Then his ideas seemed revolutionary, insightful and impractical. Re-visiting his book nearly 20 years on little has changed in my view of its content, but the world has moved on and what seemed impractical now appears possible.I would urge anyone involved in creating modern systems based on distributed and dynamic principles to study Checkland."
4,lovely,"Lisa has a lovely voice and writes lovely melodies.She looks lovely and her lyrics are, well,lovely.This is not to sound negative, I like her album a lot, especially the song 'Wishing Heart' which was the one song which touched me deeply. Yes,that is probably the point, it (her music) doesn't grab your soul like maybe Heather Nova or Sarah McLachlan's music would do. This is not Lisa's fault though, she has a tough time being this *lovely* and cute. If you like her style (and yes,I do !!!!), then you won't regret having bought this.I got it for x-mas and listen to it LOTS.Good Album. *L0VeLY................*"
2,how much of a fan are you.. anyway?,"are you willing to pay $... for one extra track? Think about it.First of all.. I would like to state that I'm a HUGE Lisa Loeb fan. I have all her albums and singles. So when I saw this import album with an extra song (""Eno Ambient #5"") In it- I rushed and purchased it and for my surprise I came Uppon one Of the weakest songs that makes it clear as to why the song was not included in the American version of the CD. Lisa's vocals are weak and tired and the lyrics not much better.Buy both the Wonderful TAILS or FIRECRACKER for the price of this import."
5,Angelic,"Boy was I surprised at this album! This is GREAT! I got ""Firecracker"" as part of a package of 3 CD's - I really bought the package for the other 2 CD's, but I like this one the best!I had heard ""I Do"" on the radio, and I liked it, but I had no idea that Lisa Loeb is really a force to contend with in her musical talent. She writes great songs, based primarily in acoustic guitar, with intelligent lyrics. Even further, her voice is absolutely angelic.Many of these songs are simply beautiful. To single a few of them out, however, would serve as an injustice to the others. I have had this album in my CD player consistently since I got it.I thoroughly enjoy this disc, and I am definitely buying other music from Lisa Loeb. She is the real thing - writing great songs, playing the guitar, and singing as well as the best of them. This one is a keeper!"
2,Not as Advertised,"I returned the RipFlash TRIO 128MB MP3 Player/Recorderby PoGo! for two reasons:1) Amazon states under the Features section for this product that it ""Uses Smart Media Card."" Guess what--it doesn't.2) This product doesn't come with a belt clip or any other way to secure it. I know that if I put it in my shirt pocket, it would fall out in no time. If I put it in my pants pocket, it would get scratched up, or its buttons would get pushed inadvertently. I don't want to spend this amount of money on something that doesn't have some protection from damage of this sort while it is being used."
5,Best Bang for Your Buck!,"I absolutely love Puppet Master and to own all 9 movies is total bliss!I was comparing prices if I bought these individually and by just buying the total package, I've saved around $60!"
4,pretty cool,good boxset its better than the 100 dollar 1 they came out with first plus 2 more movies every movie gets their own disc.
3,Puppet Master Collection,This collection is everything I expected it to be . If your into these types of movies this collection is worth buying. It has all the movies and some good extras. Mind you they are not like watching Shakespeare but they are entertaining.
5,Great box set,"My boyfriend loves these movies and he was very excited when watching them. The second movie wasn't the best, but the series is fun to watch. The set came all together too and not damaged at all during shipping."
5,Classic Humor From Someone You Should Discover,"Generally, you are either a ""Shep fan"" who grew up listening to him on WOR or you don't know much about him. Do a search on his name and DL some of his radio shows from the 60's or 70's. You'll be hooked. It will also make reading some of his stories more enjoyable, as you will be able to get a sense of his cadence and delivery."
4,Too big for me,"I love watches that have expandable wristbands, but this one is too big for my small wrist. It also tends to pinch my skin more than other expandable wristband watches I've had before. However, it's a very attractive watch and I still wear it most every day despite the fact it's a little big."
3,"It doesn't quite ""Get Me Off"".","To be honest, after all I heard about ""Rooty"", I expected a bit more. It's not bad, just not excellent. ""Romeo"" is a good start. ""Where's Your Head At"" is definitely the high point of the disc, and also the most aggressive track. I actually was hoping the rest of it would be more like that. The other tracks are more dance/pop, and most lack a driving beat. It's not that I wanted something like ""Lords Of Acid"" or ""Ministry"", but something similar to ""Junior Senior"" or ""Daft Punk"", which this may be, but not as good. So again, it's decent, just not that exciting."
2,Remedy = Good Stuff; Rooty = Bad Prince,"Pull out your Prince, Time, Apollo, and Vanity records and you'll get Rooty. YUCK."
2,"Not very good, but no need for arrogance!","Oddly, I agree with the two snobbish reviews below who say ""Rooty"" doesn't live up to it's promise. After pulling out all the pop stops for ""Romeo,"" which is already my single of the year, the Jaxx seem rather torn between the styles of Missy Elliot and Marshall Jefferson. The CD suffers from a lack of concentration, and no other song here matches ""Romeo"" for exuberance or immediacy.As for those wanks who think you have to be ""intelligent"" to listen to ""real"" house music, well, let's all just have a laugh at their spineless arrogance. House is about bringing people together, not being exclusive. Loosen up, ya scabs!"
3,"Pretty Good, But Not What I Expected","After hearing (and seeing the video for) Where's Your Head At, I picked this CD up. It's not quite what I expected.Where's Your Head At differs from the rest of the tunes -- a little wicked and a little rocking with the retro synths. The rest of the CD seemed more like light funk. The beats are great, but the vocals and lyrics give you nothing to grip onto. If like me, you're hooked on Where's Your Head At, you might want to consider buying a CD single instead..."
5,Great Return,"I thought Basement Jaxx would find it hard to come up with an album that would be able to match the sucess of Remedy, but they have managed to do it with Rooty their new album. Rooty is a catchy and diverse as Remedy but it has the sound of progression and evolution. The first single to be released from this album is Romeo (number 6 in the UK) which is a good show case song for the album as its a song that will draw peoples attention to this album. Other standout tracks aer, SFM, Kissalude, Get Me Off and Crazy Girl. This album should get Basement Jaxx loads of new fans, and keep the older ones contented with their new offering"
4,"Half the CD is good, so get it.","Overall, I liked this CD. It has 4 or 5 good tracks which I suppose makes it worth it to buy it. Track 1 - Decent song. I had been hearing this on the local indy radio station for awhile before I realized it was a Basement Jaxx song. Probably the best dance song on here. 2-Groovy beats and old-school vocals, not bad. 3-About the same as 2 but when mellower beats 5-Similar to 1, probably the 4th best on here. 6-Soft beats with a sweet voice behind the lyrics. 7-Song is a bit busy at times, sort of giving me a headache. 8-Probably my second fav on here. Slow, deep, varying beats with a woman singer will also get me. 9-Great song, the best on here. I picture monkeys running around for some reason. 11-It has its moments. 12-Didn't I hear this in a TV commercial? 13-Good simple song with little vocals... ends the CD well."
5,A must-have for all who love new style metal!,"This album took me to a new level of thinking and it will do it to you too. But hte terible thing is they wont do it again, for on December 11 of 1998, the lead singer of Snot, James Lynn Strait died in a car crash along with the bands mascott Dobbs the dog. This tragidy ended the life of a great band and I think everyone should check em out at least once for Lynn's sake! R.I.P. Lynn Strait and Dobbs."
1,wuz up this album is terrible,ok i feel bad the singer died but this album sucks.i listen to it about four days and then i sold it because it was so boring.nothing relly new with the music the songs sound all the same.if you want good music get sugar rays old stuff or nin or korn.now thats what i call good music
2,A mixed bag.,"Have had this printer for 4 months now, and under Win2k it works well, scanning is not it's strong point, but printing is pretty good for the price, despite a slightly flimsy feel. Of course, the toner price is the catch. Tot up the total cost of ownership before you buy.My gripes? Well, the mail in rebate is a nightmare. I havn't managed to claim it despite diligently following the instructions. It feels like a scam. Secondly, although it is not marketted as Mac compatible, these days that's simply not good enough. I have just brought a new mac into the house, and having no support from Samsung on this is bad. Worse still is that there is a mac driver for it, that they withdrew a while back. Of course, no help from their support.Overall, you get what you pay for. Good value I suppose, but you'll pay for toner in the long term, and don't expect any bells and whistles."
2,Will not charge anymore in my Nikon charger!,"I purchased one of these batteries so that I could have an extra for my Nikon Coolpix 4300. I charged it successfully a few times and it seemed to be working fine at first. Now when I try to charge it with my Nikon charger, the light blinks rapidly. The Nikon instruction manual suggests that when this happens, it indicates there's a problem (as in - the battery may be unable to charge). My original Nikon battery still charges normally with no problems and everything works as it should. I don't know if I just got a bad battery or whether this is a very common problem. Just be aware that this could happen to you!"
2,It fails as a litigation novel,"As a practicing attorney I savored the idea of being able to endure a long flight and read a novel written about an area of law that receives scant attention in the popular press: professional responsibility. Unfortunately, I think I picked the wrong book and ended up with a dimestore ""chick-flip.""The authors spend so much time trying to make women identify with the needs of the female main character that her rather interesting legal problems sound like a voice-over from a tampon commercial. Since one of the authors is a lawyer, she puts in just enough law to give it some credibility. Unfortunately, either they do not think their readers would be interested in a serious litigation novel or they want to push what appears to be an improbable plot line on the readers, so people who would be genuinely interested in the plot details are left hanging, angry, and thinking the whole story is improbable!"
2,"Chip on His Shoulder, But Interesting","Having grown up in the AOG denomination, and having witnessed much of the corruption of the 70's and 80's, I could believe most of what the author details. It has a gossipy feel...rather ""National Enquirer"" for the pentecostal set. It kept my interest, although I could have done without the gratuitous description of his first intimate encounter with the woman who would become his wife. The tone is self-pitying, but perhaps he had reason to feel poorly-used by the powers-that-were at the time."
5,Family Originals will show you how to create Family Heirlooms!,"Lucie and Lucy have written a book to inspire you to preserve family history in a fun and heartfelt way. This colorful book is filled with hundreds of photos to show you examples of what other families have done. It will help and encourage you to select and collect ideas and keepsakes and then give you creative ways in which you can preserve them. What better way to connect with those you love than to create an heirloom - a personal lasting ""Family Original."" As a grandma who feels strongly about passing along family lore, history and values to grandchildren, I highly recommend this book."
4,Where has Mo vanished to?,"This is a long and finely detailed novel by a writer who was much published and well reviewed two decades ago. Since then he has vanished from popular consciousness. Reading ""An INsular Possession"" reminded me what a fine historical novelist he is and I hope that he publishes something again real soon."
4,The whole line is nice!,"I have four pieces in this pattern. They look good, and work fine. The wastebasket is especially nice."
2,Needs improvement,If you're looking for an over the seat organizer that doesn't get in the way of little feet- this won't work. As soon as you put stuff in the pockets it hangs forward and the strings don't attach well to the other seat.
4,Kind of small but worst the price,This product is good to put few items. If you have a lot of magazines like me it may damage the product.
3,"""New"" Magnalite","We have owned many Magnalite products from the original manufacturer and were really happy with the products. Recently purchased a ""new"" Magnalite Chicken Fryer. While it carries the Magnalite label and looks like the original. its quality nowhere approaches that of the originals. This is just a general note on Magnalite, that buyer be beware of what you are getting now."
5,Excellent product,"I have a workshop filled with woodworking tools - lathe, table saw, planer, jointer, SCMS, sanders, bandsaw and more. It's all hooked up to a cyclone DC, but becausebtevshop is directly connected to the house I've been dealing with dust all over everything for years.Bought two of Hess for the house and in less than a week I can see the difference. Plus, they filter articles smaller than 1 micron, which is very important if you are serious about healthy lungs.Highly recommended sta good price."
1,-no better than the cheap stuff,Over the last 15 years I have tried every brand of carbon out there. From Marinlan to the generic brands even some of the store brands that you buy from Petco or Petsmart.Does this work? Oh yeah quite well in fact. BUT so does the cheap stuff. I have bought 3lb bags of generic carbon from a seller here on Amazon and that stuff works just as well.The difference? On this product they break it all into tiny little bits compared to the cheap stuff is usually in pellet form.personally I have considered even grinding or blending (in a blender) the cheap stuff to see if you can achieve the same consistency as the more prepared stuff from this company or Marineland. Not that I can or can not prove ot really makes any difference.Personally I am going back to the cheap stuff. I clean my filter every two months and replace the carbon then and like I said can't see any difference. At least not one worth paying 5x as much for .
1,Phillips ought to be ASHAMED of themselves!,"This DVD player isn't worth the space it takes up in your entertainment system. I've had exactly the same problem as everyone else - skipping really badly; didn't matter which position I selected in the carousel. I think I was able to watch 3 movies without disruptive skipping over the last 1-1/2 years. Though I did purchase another one once I realized this was a problem, I kept trying to see if I could figure out what was wrong with the Phillips. I initially thought the DVD was dirty or defective, only to find it played fine in my portable DVD player. I finally disconnected the Phillips and am ready to toss it. I won't even donate it to a thrift store for fear that some family may look forward to using it only to be at least as disappointed and frustrated as I was. Do NOT purchase this DVD player unless you're a glutton for punishment."
1,If you got it as a gift GIVE IT BACK,"I've bought some junk electronics before in my time but this is as close to the bottom of the barrel as you can scrape. Out of the box it wouldn't play ANYTHING, whether it was a regular DVD or any of the two dozen types the manual says it won't support (CD-R, DVD-ROM, et cetera et cetera). I immediately returned it and got a five-disc Toshiba changer that was the exact same price, and it worked perfectly from the moment I turned the power on. Philips used to make good smeg, but their motto was wrong about this one: it's NOT getting better all the time."
1,De-Klein,"Far from her best...so far it is hard to recall that she ever produced her best while listening to this mess. Klein is short for DeKlein in my book. His bland overcooked production turned Mitchell from her most exciting path (her jazz explorations) to boring MOR dreck. Why she continues to use him as a producer remains a mystery. As a longtime Mitchell fan I often feel robbed of several years that could have followed through on the promising directions of Summer Lawns and Hejira. Instead he lead her in a downward spiral and finally inactivity. His track record speaks for itself, producer of an audiophile who's who of bland singers marketable only to the absurd egos of audiophillia, who typically listen to snippets of sound, rather than whole songs, let alone whole albums. Sadly his latest victims are Luciana Souza and Raul Midon, both of whose talents he has squandered, as sis his norm."
2,Bad Communication,"Cartridges have trouble communicating with printer hardware, only print a couple of pages then printer crashes with these cartidges."
4,Even My Doctor Was Surprised...,"This book essentially talks about our current eating habits and how its the cause of most of our 'lifestyle' type diseases. I think this book may/could a bit dated since it categories food by Complex carbs, etc rather than the using the glycemic index type of categorisation. It would have loved to have seen at least a discussion of this concept.The basic thrust of the book is we're eating too-much protein which causes acidosis which leads to a whole bunch of problems (I think the author recommends less than 25 grams a day)... which is very little in comparison to our normal diets (at least for the majority of people).I would have given it a 5, if glycemic index type of analysis would have been covered and reconciled back to the authors diet plan.P.S. Even my doctor wasn't aware of EXCESS protein causing acidosis..."
5,Best book to explain pH on the market,"This book is filled with great information - I am on my second read. I have read manybooks on pH, yet this is the first one that truly explains how the pH of the bodytruly works. Just read this one and throw the rest away. Very informative book anda must read not just about pH, but the body and how it works."
4,This book delivers what it promises,"I am an artist who has only a vague understanding of what is meant by the term, ""abstract art"". I bought this book because I want to understand both the concepts behind the term ""abstract art,"" and the basic technical approach that an artist might take in creating an abstract work. This is a thoughtful book that is very well researched and illustrated. I would recommend it to a general audience as well as to artists."
3,Beautiful Item,"This item is very attractive and fits beautifully and protects the phone great. The only downfall is that it makes the phone bulkier. The Treo is big as is, this made it worse."
2,"Good Circulation, loud & does not remove odor","We bought this air purifier for our sons room which is over a crawl space. The idea was to circulate the air & remove some of the musty odor. 1)the purifier vibrates the floor, causing increased noise, 2) the musty odor has not decreased,the air does not feel/smell crisp, 3)if you turn the machine off or unplug it the filter clean sensor resets itself, as if you put a new filter in. Which is not good, that means you have no idea how dirty the filter is."
2,not as quiet as Honeywell claims,"I bought this model because it said Ultra Quiet on the box and even bragged about how it achieved such a quiet motor. I'm rating this 2 stars because I feel Honeywell did not live up to what they advertised. On the lowest speed, this thing was still loud enough to hear over my t.v. set. On speeds 2 and 3 it vibrated my hardwood floor and was obnoxiously loud! I tried using it downstairs on the carpeting, but was still annoyed at the sound, so finally returned it. I checked out a larger Honeywell unit (round / appx. $239) and it was indeed very quiet on the lowest setting. I will probably spend the extra $$ on that one. Whatever you buy, try it out in the store first!"
5,A really great read!,"I could not put this book down....it's fantastic! The author, whose mother died when he was a college student, pieces together her pre-motherhood life to create a wonderful story of a complex young woman...a woman who, to paraphrase his words, peaked at a young age and spent the rest of her life trying to capture that success. I appreciate the emotional and literary efforts Mr Freedman put into this book...it was a joy to read and gave me lots of food for thought. Highly recommend!"
3,Does not pick up faint sounds,"I can hear my own heartbeat just fine with this, but I bought it hoping to be able to hear my child's heartbeat in utero as well. Unfortunately it does not pick up the baby's heartbeat (although my husband can hear the heartbeat now just by putting his ear close to my stomach)."
5,only a true story could be so amazing,"this book is incredible -- the life that Kent Walker lived would not be believed if it was fiction. The fact that it is a true story is amazing . I found that this book unlike many true crime books was well researched and expertly written , kudos to authors for bringing this incredible story to life."
4,a romodel for all,"Joan of Arc is an excellent story of a girl who stood up for what she believed in and did not back down to anyone. She was a great example for anyone today. She showed us how to be persistent in achieving our goals and how to stand up for what we believe, despite what anyone else thinks. I enjoyed the book very much and I would recommend it to anyone. I think there is a great lesson to be learned and that is to fight for anything and everything that we believe in and not to let anyone persuade us into thinking differently. That's true strength. Everyone should read this book."
3,Good headphones for the price,"Well I've had these headphones now for little over a month and they are alright. They aren't great mind you but the sound is good, the volume control function is great which is the reason I bought them for my wife. Now we can Gears of War 2 and ODST at the volume I like and she doesn't complain that its too loud. Also the detachable cord from headphones is pretty cool, I thought I broke them the first time I accidently pulled the cord out : ] Hah! I would probably rate these headphones higher but they don't sound as good as my Sennheiser HD 595's and the kind of too tight for me. I can use them but after and hour my ears start to hurt and not from the sound :s. So if you have a smaller head which my wife does compared to mine you won't notice anything. All in all they are a good choice for the price and I would recommend them to anyone searching for decent headphones on a budget! Laters...Frank"
4,your daily wake up call,This book was funny in some ways and serious in others. It certainly makes you think about stuff that is for sure. I bought it just to see what it was about and some of the sayings caught my attention. A great book if you have just broken up in a relationship or thinking of breaking up...it will make you think.
2,Gals: there's a better book,"Ladies, listen up: There's a better book for single gals--by far--than this one. Check out Ditching Mr. Wrong, by Nicholas Aretakis. I recently had to read a stack of dating books for a writing project, so I've had a chance to compare every relevant title out there. In Ditching Mr. Wrong, Aretakis betrays the ""secret handshake"" between guys and lets gals know what tricks and traps to avoid when single men are on the prowl. If I had a 20-something daughter, I'd buy Ditching for her instead. The viewpoint in He's Just Not That Into You is, in my eyes, a tad misogynist. Ditching, on the other hand, shows women how to quickly vet a Mr. Wrong so she doesn't waste her time. It's also chockfull of fun tips, quizzes, and checklists. It's a high self-esteem book and exceptionally practical--much more so, in my opinion, than He's Just Not That Into You."
5,Wake up call,Gives you a jolt of realty. Squashes all of men's excuses. Harsh but worth listening too especially if you are in a questionable relationship!
4,Great Product except for the batteries,This has been a great mp3 player. My only complaint is that the batteries die in about 2 days whether you use it or not. This happens because if you throw it in you bag the button that turns it on is easily bumped (even in the case) and you end up with a dead battery. Other than that it is a good product.
1,Digital Rights Management,People should boycot this product because Sony is trying to impose its digital rights management on all of the users. The device requires proprietary software that includes features to limit transferability of music. Cut this short by buying a different MP3 player.
4,It Was Good!,I'm a big Rugrats fan and my favorite characters are Tommy and Chuckie. I thought All Growed Up Was great it was much better than the Rugrats Movie which was a little disappointing and I was really bored watching it and was glad when it was over but All Growed Up is a lot of fun to watch and I could definitely watch this again.
5,"""You're a Friend to me...""","I really loved this special! I almost thought Susie(Growed-Up) wasn't going to be in this(I looked at the Book). It's about the Rugrats 10 Years older. Kimi Looked great as her Growed-up self, It was shocking to see the medallion ending up in the sandbox rather than in Spike. Susie and Tommy almost didn't go to the Emica cocert, but Susie Decided to go with the other Rugrats even though she had to babysit Tommy so he could prove his Dad's medallion wasn't gone after all! YAY! The song ""You're a Friend To Me""(Sung by Emica with Older Angelica and Tommy) sounds like it was written for Pokemon(the American Version)! Enjoy it! Happy 10th Anniversary, Rugrats!"
3,3 In one,"The oil opened and spilled all over the package, not sure if there's a way to prevent this? I still used it, just had to clean it off."
5,Worthwhile Book,This book is very well written. The case studies take you in a logical progression through the different aspects of web site design. Anyone who's doing web site design for a living (like me!) should read and study this book. I plan to buy more of Lynda Weinman's books based on my experience with this book
5,Worth buying even if you don't sew,"I do a little historic sewing (not a lot) but this is an amazingly beautiful book to look at. It has pictures of everything--clothes and hats and trims and sewing techniques and, well, just everything. The engravings are stunning and the production is superb. If you're at all interested in Victorian fashions, this book is worth having."
2,nice fluff...but somewhat unsatisfying,the writer obviously does not know her time periods!!! But it's a cute book and very much like all of the Sweet Valley ones.
3,Strange Medicine,"Certainly the simplistic advice in this book can't hurt, but it is not a medical boon for anyone who truly suffers from depression. This book is a ""Chicken Soup"" for the technosaavy, urban soul who wishes to surround him or herself with tomes of improbable successes and unrewarded genius. Nishigaki is a Chauncey Gardener for the Internet set. I get unsupressed pleasure planting this book on my desk and watching the reactions. You will too."
4,A 1st timer that isnt afraid to speak.,"As we go through life trying to figure out where we are, Mr. Wooten goes back to where he was and where he wants to be. He held back, however...there are words that still need to be spoken. His poetry is awesome and I for one am looking forward to his next try."
4,Nice book,This book is helpful for those just starting to learn about epidemiology. The book is written at about a high school or college freshman level.
2,They did a rush job on this.,"I love Tom & Jerry and jumped when I saw this collection. But the first thing I noticed is that the Audio is not level between episodes. Some of the are blaring loud and others are like whispers. I have to continuously play with the volume whenever I watch it. In fact I think I am going to return it and wait till they do it right. Plus I want all the episodes not just these 40. So maybe I will wait for a complete set to be released. Now as for the editing of the cartoons, I am not sure since I don't remember what the original's are like but the one I have does have Mammy in it but she doesn't say anything.... so I am not sure if they fixed the discs or not for being edited. I doubt they have."
2,Bring back Mammy Two-Shoes!,"All indications are that this will not be the original ""Tom & Jerry"" but a politically-corrected version.I recall about 25 years ago when local TV showings of ""Tom & Jerry"" began to be edited and ""Mammy Two-Shoes"" was given an Irish accent!! Geez, I was shocked at the insult to that character. (I had previously viewed, many times, the original series in the movie theaters and on 1950's TV.)I refuse to pay relatively big bucks to support such censorship and political paranoia."
4,I couldn't put it down! Terrific Civil War fiction.,"I had never read any Civil War fiction before, as I generally stick to non-fiction accounts of the conflict, but I absolutely loved this book. A fascinating look at the lives of of slaves, generals, sergeants, privates, common folk and journalists set around the Battle of 2nd Manassas. As a student of the War, I truly appreciated the historical accuracy of the novel with regards to troop placements and ponts of conflict, as well as the real historical characters that Wicker includes in the story. I particularly liked the sub-plot involving the general/slave-holder's wife, home alone with all the slaves. Worth the read, without a doubt."

4,Katadyn Hiker Pro,"Flows nice. Fills a liter bottle in well under a minute with minimal effort. I pumped out of an active beaver pond and didn't get sick. In running water, a creek, the intake siphon isn't heavy enough to keep it in deeper water. The current keeps pushing it out to the edge. I might try a tent stake and a rubber band to keep it in the mid-water."
4,"Packable, Easy to use (with three hands), Satisfying","We used this filter for the first time on a two-day backpacking trip. Although the Steripen seemed like a great idea for size and speed, we were concerned about the threads on our bottles being contaminated by dipping in the water source. Although larger, this filter is similar in price, so we gave it a shot.Its weight was a plus, and it was easily packable in its thin nylon zipper-case. Operation was simple: just drop the input hose into your water source and pump the handle. It's helpful to have a third hand to hold the output tubing in your canteen, unless you have a perfectly flat surface on which to stand the bottle.As for output, it was really fast, and tasted just like you would imagine a clear mountain stream should taste. Definitely pleased with this purchase. A satisfying piece of equipment.Of note, microfilters do not generally protect you from water-borne viruses. Know the risks of where you are traveling."
2,Broke Easily,Used this twice for on backpacking trips on the AT...one week trip and a weekend. Worked very well. Took it on a long day hike and couldn't get it to work...found out that the intake stem was broken. Never put the filter under too much stress for it to break in such a way. My advice...pay more for a better qaulity pump.
5,Katadyn Hiker PRO Filter Review,"Purchased the Katadyn Hiker PRO several weeks ago for use on the AT - Harper's Ferry to Caledonia State Park trip. The PRO quick connect feature makes the filter extremely easy to use. Pumps very fast and converted some other trip members who were using a MSR pump, which pumped much slower and required more effort. The unit pumped water from multiple sources for 5 days - no ill effects, supplied 6 people, lightweight, fast and easy to setup and breakdown. Need I say more?"
4,Great for what it is,Hiker pro worked flawlessly first trip out. its compact very light and makes water clean. pump is easy and i was amazed how fast it actually fills containers. good product for hiking and backpacking. only reason i gave 4 stars is because the price of a spare internal filter. replacements are almost as expensive as unit and i like to keep a spare around. i would recomend this to anyone hiking for a day or multiple day trips.
2,It worked great at first.,"Katadyn Hiker PRO Water Microfilter worked great for the first gallon of water being pumped.If you need to use this on a day hike, or even over night trips you should carry a new filter with you. I have used the Hiker PRO only four time before the filter had stopped completely up. ""it will not go 200 gallon per filter""It will build up so much pressure that the inlet valve will burst and not suck up any water. the only good thing about the katadyn is that you can call the company and they will send you a new housing unit ,but you still need to have plenty of filters for it . and at 20 to 30 dollars a filter i don't think its a very good product to buy. I have talked to other people that have also bought this type of of micro filter and they have said the same thing,,, (that it will break down on you after the first gallon of water pumped)."
1,Water tastes so bad you cannot drink it!,I took this to Africa for a month and only got water that tasted so bad that no one would drink it. Ever try to find bottled water in the middle of Serengeti National Park? How about finding a replacement filter out amongst the Maasai?It took two people to work: one to pump and the other to hold the bottles so that they did not keep falling over. Very awkward to use! It needs some design work and serious quality control testing!
2,"Makes a loud, annoying tone when used with a cordless phone","I bought my TeleZapper for use with a new Motorola 2.4 GHz Digital cordless phone. Whenever I press the ""ON"" or the ""HANDS-FREE"" buttons on the handset, the phone emits a loud and annoying beep. This makes it very difficult to hold the handset close to you ear when you make or take a phone call. When I disconnect the TeleZapper, this loud tone is not present.Anyone else have this problem?"
5,This really works!,"I must admit, I didn't expect it to, but it really does! My unsolicited calls *almost* disappeared. BTW, I do not have a problem with a ""beep"" noise when I pick up the phone -- it just sits there and does its thing. If only I had one for the spam in my email inbox..."
1,Tele Zapper does not work,I purchased this product but soon found it did not do what it is suppose to do. Calls are not blocked after I gave the Tele Zapper time to work. I will send the product back.
3,Zapped!,"I ordered a Telezapper to replace mine that worked very effectively. My father was plagued with telemarketers so I gave him my telezapper and ordered myself another one. When I received this telezapper, it was properly boxed and was said to be in original container unopened. I opened the box, installed the zapper and it won't work. I have reinstalled it several times, and it still won't work. I contacted the seller through Amazon.com and he said he can't do anything about it, I have to contact the company as he bought it at an estate?? I am very disappointed and feel I've been shafted."
1,outdated,"Seems to function ( that it tells me it is on ) though that is it. never seems to actually -stop- bothersome calls, soo...perhaps a newer model is needed. Or else the tele market fiends have finally found a way around it."
2,Tele Zapper,"I can't tell if this thing is working or not. Still getting annoying telemarketing calls, but I think they have decreased a little bit. Instruction are not too clear."
1,Be sure this is what you want!,"I didn't purchase one of these, because I found out something useful before I did. I had the blocker service on my phone, purchased through the telephone company. It did a great job of filtering out calls from telemarketers. But, what I didn't know was, it also filtered out calls from phone cards and all 800 numbers. I have some relatives and friends that have either phone cards with limited minutes or an 800 number they use. The blocker service I had wouldn't let these calls through. I found out from the telephone company that the TeleZapper would do the same. So, if you know someone you would like to hear from that uses these things, just be aware that they wouldn't be able to get through if you put the TeleZapper on your line."
1,Faulty Product,"TeleZapper TZ 900, did not work.TeleZapper TZ 900, was faulty.Returned the TeleZapper TZ 900."
1,Bad product,"It worked two days then created constant static on the phone line so I had to take it off. IT WAS NO GOOD, I just lost $20"
1,caution-device may be responsible for phone line noise,"In retrospect, I am not sure how well this worked. As another reviewer stated below, after a couple of years, when using my cordless phone, I started to hear static, then eventually, I heard a very loud, annoying pulse tone which the person I called also heard.Assuming the line noise was due to my phone/DSL line, I called my telephone service provider to check the line. I was thinking of changing my DSL line filters or buying a new phone (assuming some problem with my Panasonic 2.6 GHz phone). When I figured out this device was responsible, the Zapper went immediately into the garbage.Not sure what started the problems (bad battery?, latent defect?). In the end, am not sure how effective this device is as I still received plenty of unsolicited calls. In any case, this device was not worth the trouble and cost."
2,Boring,"For the converted and knowledgeable about St. Therese - you will be reaffirmed. For those looking for a good movie, you will be bored to tears..."
3,Therese . Movie. excellent movie.good acting .great scenery & costumes & hairstyles,"Therese .Movie about the saint, 1880's French.Endorsed by the Vatican in Rome. Good acting great scenery, Costumes & hairstyling. Filmed in Portland & Salem Oregon.My video purchase came from a video rental dealer, used copy had no book of detailsed filming about the project."
3,Not one of Rollins' best,I could tell this was an early Rollins' effort. It's not as good as his later books (Sigma Force especially). It's predictable and the writing is a bit amateurish. My suggestion is to skip this and go right to the Sigma Force novels.
5,Original Creatures,If you like scary besties this book is for you. Some of the most oringal creations on paper reside within this books pages. Is still smile when I think about the originality of the creatures and how well they were descibed. One of James Rollins' best.
3,Thar She Blows?,"Rollins, a favorite author of mine, has written some pretty amazing books. That said, ""Ice Hunt"" is not one of his best. While it has its moments, I had a sense of deja vu while reading it. In a sense, I felt like I was reading ""Ice Station"" by Matthew Reilly again. I love both authors but their choices can be a bit ""odd"" at times. Rollins has chosen as his monster a pack of walking whales. Below (or is it above) that is a plot about human experimentation in cryogenics. So...we have our civilian heroes struggling between American black ops, Russian troops, and some kind of Moby Dick on land. (Land Shark anyone?) Rollins has done better work. I'm a sucker for a polar story but this one left me cold."
3,entertaining but unoriginal and annoyingly innaccurate,"Overall I enjoyed the book as a quick piece of improbable but exciting adventure fiction. I agree tho, with the other reviewer that someone writing in this genre should at least take Military Stuff 101. How many time does the Navy captain risk losing ""his captain's bars"", for crying out loud. Are Delta teams sent out with no officers? Some of this a fifth grader who read Guadalcanal Diaries would know."
4,Great action thiller,"This is my first Rollins book and it was very entertaining. A lot of action, suspense and thrills. If you like the Die Hard-like idea of an every day Joe involved in extrodinary circumstances mixed with Aliens-like suspense you'll love this book. Characters are pretty well written, and likeable for both men & women readers..I would recommend it."
3,Please let me know,"Although this is a relatively comprehensive text, better explanation of answers to problems in each chapter would make it much easier to understand. Is it possible to obtain this book in a Teachers' Edition? I have been looking for quite some time and am unable to find it. If anyone knows where to buy this edition, please contact me."
2,This book is far from adequate for readers at any level.,"This book is almost impossible to read. It is filled with oblique, technical references that leave everyone, even me and the two other people in my Pre-AP class that make A's, completely bewildered. There is some connection between the material presented in the chapter and the problems in the back of the chapter, but not much. This book also goes on tangents into highly technical examples instead of actually teaching and explaining the topics presented. The only redeeming value of this book is the number of fairly helpful example problems that are provided."
1,This person never send out the book I bought.,"I bought this book and never receive the book.The person who sell the book didn't response tomy email inquiry. I don't want to give any star,but the minimum is 1 star for any review."
1,College Physics Sol'n Manual Vol.2,"I was under the impression that this solutions manual would have solutions to all the textbook problems, but it only has specific ones. A little disappointed, not worth the money you'd spend on a book."
2,Blech,"This book totally failed to explain the concept of torque to me, I spent one hour reading the torque chapter twice and it failed to show me. Then I asked my friend online and he was able to explain it to me in less than a minute. This book is only good for the problem sets, which occasionally have a cameo from a Warner Brothers cartoon and one picture of Raymond Serway on a bed of nails. You will not be able to teach yourself physics concepts if you use this book, so if your professor assigns it, I recommend you go to class. Maybe that's why he or she assigned it in the first place."
2,At times clear and coherent while other times ambiguous,The text oversimplified many topics. Many sample questions did not illustrate the chapter's fundamental concepts.
1,This book is a blunder,"My physics professor's infinite wisdom faltered when he decided to use this text for our college-level class. It lacks adequate explanations of commonplace physics concepts that are essential to the understanding of the subject. The fact that it doesn't even define new vocabulary words within the text (as well as the absence of a glossary) make it a virtually useless textbook. Its only strength is the variety of colorful illustrations that keep the reader mildly amused between the pages of its nonsensical text. If I had the gradebook, I'd give it a D-minus!"
3,Makes Mom Feel Better About Wood Carving Kids,My son cut his fingers with his pocket knife a couple of times. Now he has a wood carving kit. The gloves are a bit bulky. We had better thin ones at scouts. But he hasn't cut himself again. They also work for combing the cat!
1,Eca!,"Annoying. Unbearable. That's the only words that come into my mind when thinking about the second album from ASIA. No wonder the band broke apart after this one, beginning an endless ""dance fo chairs"" with its musicians.IT's sugar pop, of course played by extremely talented musicians, but it's sugar pop anyway. Really terrible."
5,Still great after all these years,"I had this album on cassette back in 1983 and wore it out. There's not a bad song on it. My favorite track was ""Midnight Sun"", and unfortunately it didn't make it onto ""The Very Best of Asia"" (I guess they couldn't put everything on it). Also can't figure out why ""Daylight"" is not present on the CD. With or without ""Daylight"" though, it's still the best Asia album, so if you missed it then, here's your chance to hear these great songs. Strongly recommended."
4,"good book set , still needs work","I had this book set for over 4 years, and I have to say it is pretty good at teaching japanese (I picked it up pretty fast using their recommended study plan). But it still needs work...............PROS:Native speakers on the CD help you speak japanese clearly and tune your ears to fleunt spoken japanese .Proper Verb and Sentence structure lessonsEssential Words and Phrases are given and explainedJapanese Dictionary and Pronunciation GuideJapanese Grammar supplement in back of the bookEasy for absolute beginnersCONS:Native speakers only cover the *SELECTED* words in the book.No Kanji or Kana are used with the lessons (although there is a japanese alphabet section in the back of the book)Even though grammar is explained, it could be simplified with using charts instead of blocky paragraphs."
1,Don't Buy,"If you like poor sound quality, the wrong aircraft used for the topic aircraft or seeing the same film clip over and over, then buy it. If I had known what was on this I would have sent it back. However, the policy is that if it is opened you can't return it. The problem is that you don't know what a dog it is until it's opened. Catch 22."
3,Night light reading,"This is very light reading. Some of the historical insights into ""olde New York"" prove to be more interesting than the story. There are breaks in the continuity of the story line which detracted from my enjoyment of the book. But I would recommend this book nevertheless."
4,"Easy read, impressive historical mystery",A good read with a familiar feel. I think historical readers have a new series to look forward to.Sarah Brandt is a midwife at the turn-of -the-century. When a young girl boarding at Sara's patients home is murdered Sarah's lack of faith in the NYC Police Department compels her to try and solve the murder herself. Frank Malloy is a tough cop with ambitions to move up. Sarah wonders if he will consider the case worth his time and Frank wonders if she will ever go away.Victoria Thompson's first historical is a hit as far as I'm concerned. The mystery was well done and the historical jargon is clear without being overwhelming. I think it helps the reader sometimes to know what certain historical terms are and Ms Thompson was successful in explaining them without distracting from the story.
4,Murder at Astor Place,NOT QUITE FINISHED THIS BUT NEVER READ THIS AUTHOR BEFORE SO AM ENJOYING HER STYLE OF WRITING. ALSO AM ENJOYING THE TIME PERIOD OF THE STORY IN NEW YORK / I WILL CONTINUE HER OTHER BOOKS ALSO
2,Distorted reality,"This documentary is based on a true story, but some of the events have been a bit distorted. The film really did a big disservice to Billy Mitchell by pulling a 'Michael Moore' and twisting/mainpulating certain scenes and events in order to make Mitchell out to be the bad guy. (I won't go into details here because there is not adequate space, but you can Google the movie and read all about it if you're curious.)This was obviously done for dramatic effect, but when you're slamming somebody and calling their character into question by intentionally misleading the audience, that's not cool. Note that I have no affiliations with Billy and have never met him. However, I know several people who have met him (at the classic gaming expo events), and they say although he can be a little arrogant, he's a real nice guy and nothing like what the film shows.It's still an entertaining story, but just like television, don't believe everything you see."
1,Disappointed - Buy Elsewhere,"The caddy was much smaller than I expected. Additionally, the suction cups do not work well at all and the caddy is not very sturdy - all of my shower items are constantly falling out."
5,Perfect,"Awesome and simple. Holds your soap so it won't get soggy and dissolve, holds your bottles (I can fit 4-5), hang your loofa's and more. Only gripe might be that tall bottles will be close to the showerhead but I prefer that to having the caddy hanging down. Can't beat it for the price"
2,Disappointed,"Disappointed. The suction cups don't hold the caddy. It keeps slipping off. But its just $4 , so you get what you pay for. Hence a 2 star. If the produst was sold at over $10, I would have returned it and given a 1 star."
2,QUITE BORING.,TOOOOOO MUCH DETAILS AND NO ADVENTURE.WISH THERE WERE FUNNY PARTS IN THE BOOK.THEN I WOULD ENJOY IT MUCH MORE TOO.
3,The Photograph,"Interesting headlines, clear structure, but I am missing examples from other countries than UK and USA. to Too anglo-american for somebody outside UK and USA"
3,Kept us going during the hard times.,"I always remember an interview I read that David Coverdale did. Something about the music critics telling him that ""his kind of music is dead and gone."" When he got to the show and the line of people was down the street and around the bloke. One more time proving the so called music critics wrong. Thanks Dave for sticking with it bringing us such great guitar driven rock. We who still rocked during the Disco, Punk and New Wave years owe you much thanks. A great batch of music with a lot more to follow. Others have given great song reviews, so I will leave it at this."
1,Disney Princess Boutique 2,"Music and animation first rate. Princess' features and gowns way below the level of animation for the rest of the software. Although animation has improved since Princess Boutique 1, the rest has gone downhill. Was very disappointed in product."
1,This book is the most boring book I've ever read.,It would be a waste of your time to read and my time to write this review.
5,Excellent. As enjoyable as his father's book.,"Mr. Shaara does another excellent job. As with his father's book and Jeff's previous book, I couldn't put this one down."
3,Sharks?,"I'm a big Sabuda fan. However, if you're looking for sharks this isn't your book. A better title would have been ""Other Sea Monsters and a Shark."""
4,Worth every penny.,"This book is stunning. There is a lot to read (unlike the Narnia one) plus there are additional mini books to read on each page. The pop ups are awesome. My son loves sharks, and knows endless facts about them, yet in this book there were countless creatures he had still never heard of. You definitely get your money's worth. The only con is that a few of our pop ups came damaged. Nothing major, mostly on the mini ones, but still, a little upsetting. I would still buy it regardless."
2,Does not get to the point,This is not the type of book that clearly discribes what the title claims. I started this book 3 times in one month and gave up. I finaly skimmed it to see if I could get to something that made sense and did not.
2,Worthy book but so what!,"I found the ""End of Time"" extremely disappointing particularly after reading the recommendations on the back of the book. I never knew Jon Turney, John Gribbin and John Barrow to all be so wrong. This book completely lacks any discussions of what a timeless universe implies, indeed it wasn't until the notes that it was clear what the author meant by it. The ""End of Time"" is full of pages of argument as to why there is no time, but it's done in a very dull way for the lay reader, and, as the email printed in the notes shows, his thesis has far too many holes to convince more conventional physicists. There was absolutely nothing on what timelessness actually means, no speculation at all (which as a previous reviewer noted may be because there's nothing to predict). A highly worthy but dull book. I shan't be keeping it on my shelf"
3,Time and speculation,"Spoiler! Look, End of Time is an enjoyable read; but I am not sure how profound his conceptualizations are. A lot of his material seems to come from Cosmologist, Max Tegmark; in which multiple universes hypothsis(ensambles) rule the roost. Does the book cannote more meaning or meaninglessness? Not my cup of beer, but others may be thrilled by it."
3,"Interesting, but somehow, is not compelling","I slogged through this, and believe me, when you slog through a book about the nature of time, you slog.This one was wearing, but I persevered. Finally, about three quarters of the way through, I think I grasped the concept. I don't, however, agree with it. But, read it if you are interested in his theory."
2,No Payoff,"I read this book when it first came out, and I just finished reading it a second time. With any difficult subject you keep tabs of the arguments as best you can, hoping that by the end the pieces fall into place for you. And even if they don't you still hope to find out how it can be expected to influence the subject it covers. Sadly, neither of these came to pass. The author's ""time capsules"" seem to describe snapshots of the universe in absolute time, but they include not just what we would call our actual universe but any possible configuration of the universe. We experience the most probable of these time capsules. But if time is an illusion what does it matter to us? What changes? What insight does it provide? The book may have been better off if it were written in a more technical manner for experts or with more analogies and descriptions for lay readers."
5,A GOLDEN AGE,"This A to Z presentation showcases the varied aspects of Britishsteam railway operation. NOT only as it was in the past, but in our present day on the main lines and along our preserved railways. Detailed narration accompanies the story of these most remarkable locomotives. A must own for railroad buffs."
1,Used Monitor,"I had to return the monitor because it was damaged. I called the company, they sent out a second monitor. The second monitor was damaged as well. Sorry I did not read the fine print. All the monitors from this company are used."
2,Strauss Music,I had ordered 3 CDs of Strauss music. I was informed that there was a problem with my credit card on two of the items and the orders were cancelled. The third item was shipped in duplicate.(I only wanted one) and it was the worst of the three as it is more talk than music. I am not pleased with my last purchase.
2,Great Performance - Poor Video Editing,"I have been a Moody Blues fan for a very long time and when I recently purchased my BluRay disc player I purchased a copy of this disc. After viewing this disc last night I walked away disappointed. The video quality is excellent, the audio quality is good and the performance is great. But the editing of the video was terrible. It appears that the editor stuck with strict 100 frame chunks, which means that about every four seconds you are looking at a different performer through a different camera, without regard to what the music or performance is doing. This makes for a very hery-jerky performance that is very tiresome to watch."
3,The Moody Blues: Lovely To See You - Live - Blu-ray Info,"Version: U.S.AAspect ratio: 1.78:1MPEG-4 AVC BD-50 / High Profile 4.1 / 1080i / 29.970fpsRunning time: 1:45:53Movie size: 24,58 GBDisc size: 32,28 GBAverage video bit rate: 20.99 MbpsDTS-HD Master Audio English 5328 kbps 5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 5328kbps (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 1536kbps)Dolby Digital Audio English 640 kbps 5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbpsLPCM Audio English 2304 kbps 2.0 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 2304kbpsNumber of chapters: 21Subtitles: None#Band Interview (SD - 18 minutes)"
1,Disappointing Performance and Transfer,I watched this after watching the HD-DVD edition of Roy Orbison: A Black and White Night. The audio transfer was inferior and the performance was not at all what I expected. I know the band members are older now but the performance was nothing like I remember the Moody Blues. I couldn't watch the whole concert.
1,Not the right bag for the OV-4ABC vacuum,"I wish I'd listened to the disgruntled reviewer who said this is the wrong bag for the Metro OV-4ABC. The display page makes it seem like these are the bags to order, but the correct ones are the DV-5PB replacement bags. Amazon is refunding the purchase price."
4,"Vacumn Cleaner for your car, plugs into lighter","I have only used this vacumn once, but I am very happy with it. I suggest that the extra hose that can be purchased is worth the money. I purchased it and it makes things much easier."
2,Rocky Balboa,The image quality was not the best. Even Vudu and Netflix quality is much better than amazon's quality. I have a time warner connection at 10 MBS and cannot get a clear image.
4,Worthy of it's legendary name,"The writing isn't that great and the acting is hit and miss, but this is one of the better Rocky films. Stallone ended the series on a high note with this one."
4,Good movie but some problems,"This was a great movie which def. did better than Rocky V. However, for some reason it did not want to play on my computer my Playstation 2 and another DVD player. I was told on a forum that there was some new protection from Sony and some DVD players didn't want to play it. But overall this is a great movie and deserves the space on the bookshelf along with the other classics. If it wasn't for the problem with the DVD playback I would of given the move a Five star."
4,Rocky fans have to see it....,"If you've seen the others, you must see this. So much better than Rocky 5...more ""closure"" and more believable, too. Some really touching moments and be sure to check out the bonus footage. Great stuff!"
4,I thought this movie was great,"at first i thought maybe this movie would not be as good as the other five, but after seeing it i should have realized it was going to be just as great, i am not ashamed to say that i cried through the entire movie, rocky and adrienna are one of those couples that should never be apart. the reason i gave it 4 stars is, because i did not like the idea of the young lady being friends with rocky. but all in all i would recommend others to watch this movie, especially if you have been a fan of the other rocky movies."
5,Inspiration,"Since the Rocky series began, they have been an inspiration to average Americans, who hope they can advance themselves in life. This latest version ""Rocky Balboa,"" is especially inspirational for middle aged men and women. Many Americans have lost their jobs to downsizing or outsourcing. Perhaps some of them will be motivated by this film to endure their loss, make adjustments, and move on with their lives. Val Belfiglio"
2,Such a disappointment.,"Rocky Balboa is the final installment of the Rocky films and boy was I disappointed! I just hated this film, Adrian is dead, Rocky is working in an Italian resturant, he is estranged from his son, and he tries to make an ill-fated comeback in the boxing world. This film was praised so much by critcs and fans so I thought, well I've seen all the Rocky films - why not give the last one a try? I remember watching this in the theatre and just dreading every moment. Stallone looks miserable (nice plastic surgery, not!), the writing is absolutely corny and stale and the premise is depressing. I really tried to like this film but I felt something was missing. Stick to the first 5 Rocky films, those are worth every penny."
5,Big Rocky fan.,I liked the story line. Like every boxer no matter what age you want to go out and proof that you still have something in you.
1,Did not receive my book,"HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED!!!I am useing ""Amazon"" a lot, but this is first time that I didn't receive my item (book)!!!I am not sure will they give me my money back!!!"
4,A good undergraduate mechanics text,I would actually rate this book closer to 4 and 1/2 stars. I used this text for two semesters of mechanics as a Junior undergraduate physics major and found it to be well written and well organized. I found the historical introductions to the chapters to capture my interest and the material in the chapters to be thorough and logical. My only complaint of the text is that it doesn't offer more examples. I definately feel that most students with a introductory physics background could learn the principles of mechanics using this book without the help of an instructor.
2,"nice book, but...","This book does not have nearly enough solutions to end of chapter problems for a person to learn as much from this book as a person should from a book at this level. This is the only reason I gave just two stars instead of three or four. This book would benefit from more examples too. Examples and problems are essential to learning physics.Besides the lack of answers to problems, this book is a little better than average. It is written with great clarity; it never leaves you lost or confused. I used this book for self-teaching. It works well for self-study but I would suggest supplementing this book by buying a book of worked problems or finding some on the internet."
3,Good Little Book!,"This book is a very old edition. By today's standards, it is very incomplete. However, if you want to review concepts in their ""infancy stage,"" then, by all means, this a great reference book. I found it indispensible when linking classical mechanics concepts. Using Fowles and Symon got me thru classical mechanics where Goldstein failed."
2,Can't Act,I like the music but don't buy the movie because it sucks.The movie sucks because of the actors. They don't now how too act.There is not a lot of action in the movie.
4,Excellent movie but the transfer is slightly below par,"This is a monumental movie that helped to shape the identity of Jamaica after its independence from Britain. The character work is very good and the plot gets more and more interesting as the movie goes on. To top it up, the soundtrack on this movie is trully great.The only negative with this particular DVD is that it is slightly below par for a Criterion transfer. Having seen quite a few Criterions, I can say that I was not particularly impressed with the quality on that one. I am sure though that Criterion must have done the best they could with whatever ""raw"" material they had available."
5,Great set at a great price,"This was a great gift set for my mother. She absolutely loved it and has already watched the whole set. Like I said, this is a great product at a great price. I highly recommend this DVD set to anyone with this interest."
5,norht & South Book 12&3,I Love the Movie & it was in excellent condition I wouuld recommend this movie to all my friends Thank you
2,Cheated,"Was not pleased. Left out a lot of content, especially about Rory getting married. It was not good at all. Wasted my money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,So disappointed,"I bought this as a gift for my son, who loves this series. Sadly, like some others, the reverse side of the discs were blank; half the movie is missing. I ordered from Comp-U-Plus Rockland, for $18.10. Today it's $16.99. I'm going to try another vendor at about twice the price.I did contact Amazon by phone to register my displeasure with the way they post reviews. Their practice of lumping all reviews for a movie together makes it impossible to tell which seller is shipping defective discs. The seller I chose has a 97% positive rating and ships many kinds of products, and none of the recent feedback comments were about this movie. Order from them at your own risk."
3,Was ok but...,"The videos were in good condition, but it is missing some parts to it. Says the episodes are on both sides of the disc. Well it only plays one, and it is half gone"
1,Love the story but hate defective and missing DVD's,The second book has a defective disk that hesitates and the sound is messed up. Then when I got to book 3 it was missing the last DVD so could not see the end of the story. This was sold by a vender thru Amazon.
5,"A ""must release on DVD"" movie","I just watched North and South this past week. What a spectacular movie! I love Book II equally as much. This movie absolutely should be released to DVD. I gained a great deal of knowledge about the Civil War and the events leading up to it from this movie. The story line is wonderful, and every actor was perfectly matched to his or her part. A must see for everyone and a must release to DVD by Warner Brothers."
1,UNWATCHABLE,Do not buy this set! It is a great miniseries but the second part is unwatchable (it will not play on your DVD player I tried on three different players) even though there are no visible flws on the disks.
1,Big flop,"I saw this film when in came to TV and was so much looking forward to having it on DVD. I finally got it...or did I? When they put it on DVD, they edited and chopped so much of the full version out of it that it makes no sense at all and is only a shadow of what was a great mini-series . I watched it and was so sick from what those idiots do to it that I dropped it into the trash can, which is the only place for it. Don't buy this mess hopping for quality. Matter of fact, Don't buy it at all! Just don't."
3,GRANNY,"I ORDERED THESE DVD'S FOR MY HUSBAND FOR CHRISTMAS B/C HE SIMPLY LOVES THE NORTH AND SOUTH. HOWEVER, UPON WATCHING THEM, I WAS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED IN THE VIEWING OF THE DISCS B/C THEY WERE VERY POORLY DOWNLOADED, THEY SKIPPED PRACTICALLY THROUGH THE WHOLE COLLECTION, AND DISC NO. 3 IS NOT EVEN WATCH-A-BLE. ALL IT DOES IS BLIP BLIP BLIP. AND IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH, PART OF THE SEGMENT IS MISSING OR HAS BEEN TOTALLY OMITTED. I HAVE ORDERED MANY DVD'S THROUGH AMAZON, AND I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO TROUBLE WITH THEM, BUT THIS TIME AMAZON LET ME DOWN."
5,Finally!!!,"It was a very long time ago I followed this series on tv but I still remember it clearly. One of my absolute favourites. Who could forget Madeleine and Orry, Virgilia and all the others?! I especially remember David Carradine holding Lesley Anne Down (Madeleine) prisoner in his house and how Orry and Madeleine had to meet secretly. It will be amazing to relive everything that happened the Mains and the Hazards!! Can't wait!!"
4,books 1 and 2 are good...skip book 3,"North and South is a 1980s soap opera miniseries set during the Civil War. It's about how the war affects two families - The Hazards from the North and the Mains from the South. Books 1 and 2 of the series are excellent. I recommend seeing them. I gave my review 4 stars because of Book 3. It was filmed a decade later, in the 1990s. It is set after the Civil War has ended. The production is not up to the same caliber as Books 1 and 2 and the plot has too many continuity errors. I recommend skipping this one.Tag: Civil War movie"
4,North and South lives again!,I was impressed with this mini series years ago. I am very pleased with the complete collection. Book 1 and Book 2 were just like the tv series. Book 3 would make a good coaster though... very unrealistic and not at all to the caliber of the previous 2 books. However.... Book 3 is the only reason I give this 4 stars... not 5. I highly recommend any fan of the tv series to purchase the complete collection! What a blast from the past!
5,pleased,"Glad I thought to check out Amazon.com to see if they had the North and South mini series. They had the complete collection ,and at a good price. We're very happy with our purchase. It's nice not getting the run around like I've experianced with other companies. The merchandice was in excellent condition and delivered in a very reasonable time. We'll keep in touch.Tom"
1,uck,"It's missing some episodes: the war in Mexico and when the Hazards meet the Maynes. I think the whole batch is bad, because we returned it and the second one was the same."
5,Mini Series North and South,"I watched North and South when it first came out on TV, and I loved it! My husband was traveling a lot for his job at that time, and was unable to see it. Recently we watched it together. Both of us could hardly wait to sit down at night, and watch it. We hated to see it end. It had been long enough, that I didn't remember anything except the leading characters. It was exciting to see, and the acting was spectaculor. Patrick Swayze is great, and did a wonderful job in his first big hit. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the Civil war era, love, romance, action, and the bonds of true friendship. It has something for everyone. It was a great experience to view it again! It is something we could watch over and over again. I can't say that about very many things."
1,please help,The disc to the second book is scratched and will not play. What can I do about getting it replaced?
5,P.J.,"It is the best. I highly recommend this mini-series. OF course i am a big fan of Patrick Swayze's, But everyone in this series is great."
2,episodes missing,I never watched this in the 80s when it first aired. I bought the series and am disappointed to find that a big chunk is missing! There is a huge gap between the end of book 2 and the beginning of book 3. Do not buy this!
1,far to much soap for my taste,"i must be the only person on the planet that thinks this collection of mini-seriesis just a big bag of wind. i love the novels but this film is like pulling teeth, it just goes on and on and as for the battles well they are ok but not worth the trash you must sit through to get to them."
1,Question About Character in Book III,"For those of you who had the patience to watch through Book III, can anyone indentify the character of the teacher as Ali Macgraw?"
2,Where is the rest of it?,"Extremely disappointed! I would personally like HALF of my money back since I only received HALF of the mini-series. I have loved the mini-series for quite some time and had not seen it in years. I sat down looking forward to a marathon of North and South on a lazy Sunday. Although I got through the entire set of DVD's, I kept getting up,removing the DVD looking for more of the program on the other side. Guess what? NOT THERE!!!I have read other reviews, (unfortunately I didn't bother to read them before my purchase)and I strongly discourage ANYONE from purchasing this collection unless you are prepared to be VERY, VERY, VERY disappointed."
2,Disappointed for all that was cut out,I saw the series when it came out on T. V. Ordered the series 8/12 from Amazon.Way too much was cut out of the series and it jumped around. Truly truly disappointed.I am wondering how much they really cut out. I would not recommend Series. It was suppose to be a complete collection.Excuse me.......not so.
1,Blase,"Kylie's one and only US album features the hit single ""The Locomotion"", a remake of the Little Eva classic. Most of the other songs are forgettable dance ditties that are made more unbearable because of her shrill high-pitched voice. Thankfully she never got to step foot in the US again after this brief attempt, because it will be tragic if she ever gets on US radio again. Cheers to Natalie Imbruglia for not following in her footsteps!"
3,Four great songs..,"This album has four great songs: ""Mayor of Simpleton,"" ""Chalkhills and children"" (my favorite), ""King for a Day,"" and ""Garden of Earthly delights."" I wouldn't call it a classic though, some of it sounds dated. I would not say this about most of ""Skylarking,"" though, which is much better. ""Nonesuch"" to me is their most solid."
5,Classic Brit Pop,This band never got the respect they deserved in the U.S. I always enjoyed this album. I had it on cassette and had to get it on CD. Love it.
1,biginner book,"I finished Coffin Corner, 2000, and hope it was her first. I read for the Alaskan landscape and places. Love it.Conversations, thoughts not geared to 37 year old woman, exclamations waaay outdated and inappropriately used. Death weapon type not even mentioned until last chapter, police not even mentioned when heroine was treated for nicotine poisoning, too many mistakes to mention.Have previously read Dead Stick, and it was much better, tho flawed. Probably won't buy this author again."
5,great water filter,I have tried several water purifiers as I frequently travel to third world countries with questionable water supplies. I like this one better than any other I have used. You can quickly get a good quantity of water' It is much easier to use than the Xstream that I used to use.I have used it all over the world. It is easy to pack and easy to use. It is a winner in every way.
3,Who Gets The House?,"This movie reflects the brokenness of our family life in America. It left a lot of questions unanswered, yet it had a positive ending, and was worth what money I spent to purchase it."
2,Hard-core Dickinson fans only,"Things that make you go hmmmm... ""Skunkworks is an odd album. I would'nt say that it is bad, but, it's not one of my favorite Bruce albums. However, a good select few are definitly worth the listen. Such as ""Inside the Machine"" and ""Space Race"". I think Bruce was really getting into flying airplanes and the music and lyrics kind of reflect that. We must remember that Bruce was doing exactly what he wanted to do with this record. He always wanted to try different things and I commend him for that. To get to the point, die-hard Maiden fans who are completists with thier CD collections should, of 'course buy it."
3,A gem? Are you kidding?!,"This is not a gem at all by Bruce. His gems are ACCIDENT OF BIRTH and THE CHEMICAL WEDDING. In his projects away from sheer metal, TATTOED MILLIONAIRE and BALL TO PICASSO are better than Skunkworks.SKUNKWORKS is not a despisable album at all. But it's just that kind of album that has not a single one memorable moment, memorable riff or songs. All the songs are interchangeable, nothing deserves attention. It's is INDEED the worst Bruce solo album, and that's not because it's different (we all aprreciate Dickinson's courage to try new ideas), but the ""different"", this time, resulted in ordinary."
2,"Yeah, great idea...","One must be insane to spend US$ 17,98 on this album, which had the ""clever"" idea of printing ALL the lyrics backwards, to make them annoying (and impossible) to read. I don't know who supplied Bruce Dickinson with this fantastic idea...Maybe it was Bruce himself...It's hard to decide which is the worst Dickinson solo album: Balls To Picasso or Skunkworks. I think Skunkworks win the prize, cause Balls to Picasso has ""Tears Of The Dragon"" in it, and that song alone makes the album worth.Even so, SKUNKWORKS has its good moments. It shows once again that Bruce has a much more open and immaginative mind than his pals from Iron Maiden, and he tries a lot of new stuff here. Some of them work, others don't."
3,"Good conceptual introduction to the material, not much more","What this book does, it does well; namely, providing an introduction to the general concepts at work in electrical and electronic circuits. What it doesn't do, that many people are probably expecting from it, is to guide the reader to proficiency in anything approaching real-life circuit analysis and design, particularly once you're into Part 3 (Electronics). At that point the book reads more like a How Stuff Works article as opposed to an engineering book. That's not a terrible thing, but potential buyers should be aware of it."
5,Green Speed Control,I am so glad there is finally a book out there that can extend your game using the knowledge of the importance of the green....Great book Ill carry it with me when I play....
4,"Dark, and different.","I got this album because it's on Vermiform, and honestly it's one of the best pure noise albums I own. This band was around before most of the great noise groups today, and I wonder if this band wasn't an influence (Wolf Eyes, xinlisupreme...).One of the best things about this album is the sheer variety offered. There are moments of extremely harsh stuff on here (the beginning of ""Xia Xia"") but those are juxtaposed with moments of eerie calm (like in the second half of ""Ul Jamal"").It's an intriguing noise album, one that grows on a listener with repeated viewings, and worse seeking out if you're a listener to the aforementioned bands or acts like Bastard Noise and Merzbow."
3,Kind of Borish and Anti-Climactic. But still a decent book.,"The Runner is a story about a young man who runs. Not only on a track but in his life, almost constantly. His Running is to get away from his problems, when he runs he is free.The young man's name is Bullet Shnipps, and in his growing up he experiences the problems most men had in his time, (during the vietnam war) including segregation,the draft and family problems. Bullets whole life was centered around breaking out of the emotional boxes people tried to put him in, and he learns while growing that everyone has their own boxes to get out of and not just him. I would reccomend this book to anyone who has the patience to read a boring but well writen book."
3,"Good enough, but hipocritical in some ways","It was an enjoyable reading. It was refreshing to read about a future where women ruled. However, I was dissapointed with the homophobic views that the author depicts. For example (spoiler warning):'Even in preconvulsion times it had been known that the so-called gay syndrome was caused by aberrant hormone levels during pregnancy. The women doctors now identified the condition as hormonal reproductive maladaptation and corrected it before birth.'In other words, gay people were sick or abnormal and better off cured. In such a future, no homosexuals exist, because there's no need for them to exist when they can be 'cured'.So as you can see it left a bittersweet taste in my mouth. It's a feminist book, but homophobic too. Kinda hipocritical, in my opinion. Read at your own risk."
5,Tepper really ought to be worshipped,"One of the best ""post-apocalyptic"" pieces of fiction ever written. This was short-listed for Hugo and Nebula the year it came out. It's also an excellent introduction to one of the most overlooked authors of our time. Set after the next big war, women live in walled cities. Most men live in barracks outside the cities. When a boy comes of age, he chooses to go through the men's gate and join the armies who fight their battles between barracks or to stay in the city and act a servant to the women. Of course nothing is as it seems. The whole story is played out in alternating chapters... the intervening chapters are pages from the imaginary play ""Iphegenia at Illium"" which the women perform every festival when the men of the barracks are allowed in to fraternize and further the species...or so they think. Thought-provoking and very well written."
4,Another great album from one of the worlds greatest stars,"A great selection of memorable songs. ""I found someone"" and ""We all sleep alone"" are the true stand out tracks and I can't wait to see the tour in Dec'99."
4,Takes time,"When I first strung my bass up with these strings, the tone was a bit ""bright"", but, once broken in they sound much better."
2,"Great series, but no conclusion","Ok, so I read the Breed series and was very impressed. I loved it. Always eager for the next one to come out. To bid my time,I decided to read some of her other stuff. Unwisely, I choose the Wizard series. Don't get me wrong, Its a great series and all ... so far. But where's the third? Anyone? It's been two years and three months since the last book was written ... ending with a huge freakin' cliff-hanger I might add. No talk of the third coming out. And try e-mailing her ... if you get a response (here's hoping) you get a rehersed answer. All in all good read ... if you don't mind being left in the dark."
2,Not a favorite,Not a whole lot of substance and no action. I stopped reading it after the first 75 pages.
2,Wandering minds,"If you're easily distracted or someone who likes a story to take off this is Not the book for you. I was saddened by the fact that I just could not get into this story. I just wanted the characters to just get into it already. I really enjoyed the first story and was truly anticipating reading this part. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. It seemed to go on and on and the chacters kept going around and around, my mind started to wander and I had to motivate myself to finish reading the story. It felt like different people wrote these books."
4,Lost in Cyberspace,Lost In CyberspaceIt started out when Heather and Aaron found out how to go forward in time.They found out that bad things would happen.But then they learned they shouldn't mess with the future.The character Heather likes to disobey her family.Aaron always carries his laptop.They like a lot of the same stuff though.My opinion is that it's ok.There's nothing really great about it. I would give it a eight out of ten score.
3,"Private Schools, Black Holes, and Oh Pair Girls","Richard Peck is one of my favorite young adult authors. He has written over twenty YA novels-- some of them folk tales, some ghost stories, some mysteries, some science fiction, some combination of these genres. _Lost in Cyberspace_ (1995) is pure science fiction. Josh Lewis and his friend Aaron Zimmerman find themselves dealing with school dress codes, bullies, the black hole (the computer room at school), time traveling codes... and a succession of strange au pair girls. The book is well written and good fun. Recommended."
4,"I liked it, but . . .","This was a great book, but it didn't have a real plot. It had a couple of sub-plots, but there was nothing big, like that they got stuck in the future or the past. It drifted without settling on anything. But it was still a good book."
1,"Bare-Bare basics, with tons of promotional","If you do not have access to the internet then this would be a ok book for those who know nothing of the basics of glue and turning. I was extremely disappointed, as most of the information is extremely readily available, and the instructor is not to the advanced level yet with his woodturning, and hasn't developed any flare in turning or teaching yet. Way too soon for him to have written a book, esp. a book that is supposed to be geared towards beginners and newbies.As from the book, they will be learning a few bad habits. The author may have successfully navigated past the beginners stage, but he has a lot to still learn. From the few examples he has submitted via photos in the book, there is potential of becoming one of the 'turners' to go to."
3,technique yes - choosing a lathe no,"An interesting book that falls a little short on organization and will not help you pick out a lathe. As far as the discussion on technique, I see some ambiguity here. It would probably be better to shop for a DVD if you are looking for guidance on how to hold the tools, mount a piece of wood, etc."
2,No high meaning for me,Thought this film was a complete waste of time. Did not see the high tone of the film others saw. Want my space films to thrill me and this left me sitting on my hands
3,"Great premise, but veers off course","Sunshine could have been a fabulous Sci-fi. It had it all; the wonderful acting, the gorgeous special effects, and a great plot idea. And the film sticks to that formula for the first 2/3 of the film. I will not go into spoilers, but after a certain point, it becomes very weird and confusing. Not technically confusing, just frustratingly pointless. It makes you question why and how and doesn't give you any answers whatsoever. At that point, it seems very predictable what will happen. It gets pretty cliche very quickly. It just seems odd that it strays so much from being a science fiction, to being a murderous game of hide and seek. I was hoping for something different and it didn't happen. Its almost like the Director was thinking about how to end it, but couldn't figure it out, so he went the opposite predictable way. Which is too bad because the first half of Sunshine was pretty great."
2,This Star Fades!,"It is a great-looking but dramatically flat bit of star lore docked at the inner shores of the galaxy, rather than its outer limitsAt a certain point, like a dying star about to pop into eternal nothingness, the movie can't be seen as anything -- it just implodes.Sunshine is also an atypically humorless entry from Boyle, who's never made a film this oddly devoid of personalityDespite all that talent on display, Sunshine is a philosophical blank slateAfter a mesmerizing first hour, the film implodes so quickly our sputtering sun can barely keep pace."
1,A handsome mess,"SUNSHINE doesn't work as science fiction, or as a psychological thriller, or as an action-adventure, or as a slasher movie, or as an homage to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, or as a mystical apocalypse -- but it tries to be all of these things.The plot is laughably implausible, and the ""science"" is simply ridiculous. Lowest point of the film: Several crew members discover that they must cross between two airlocks in total vacuum. (Sound familiar?) There is only one space suit. So what do the other crew members do? They wrap themselves in ... duct tape!The one star is for the special effects, which are often very good, and for the cast members, who are all beautiful to look at and do their best to make the clunky, humorless script work.Where is Mystery Science Theater 3000 when we need it?"
1,Don't but Blu-Ray of this movie,"commentary is built into the movie in a ""Picture in Picture"" and not all players will allow you to yurn it off.What a waste of money, commentary pops up in all the action parts of the movie."
3,Great sci-fi movie - until it turns into a horror film,"This movie was strange. There were parts that were really beautiful. It was well acted and I enjoyed the characters. The first three-quarters of the movie were interesting, psychological, quiet. Of course, you expect that something is going to go terribly wrong at some point, but I really didn't expect it to turn into a horror movie at the end. It just didn't make sense to me. If you're a sci-fi fan and not a horror fan, then the end will not please you. Personally, I think it would've been a five-star movie without the strange twist. I would have preferred not to watch a crazy guy running around trying to kill everyone while his skin peeled off, shot in a headache-inducing, blurry, shaky-cam style. We could've gotten to the same ending in the movie without that, since plenty had already started to go wrong before the crazy man was introduced."
1,Sunshine turns to sunCrap,"The first hour or so was actually fine -- boring parts, good parts, etc. Your basic Save the Earth cliche, but cleverly done, I thought. However, an hour and 15 minutes or so into the film, it turns into yet another yawning edition of How Many Ways Can We Kill Off the Cast.Don't waste your money. Wait until it comes to a public library and borrow it for free. It's not worth the three or four buck rental fee."
3,Another ensemble picture that meshes moderately well,"In terms of positives, Sunshine succeeds in creating powerful feelings regarding the enormity of the mission and the stress of a deep space mission from which return becomes doubtful. The special effects are top-notch and the music is an excellent compliment.Where Sunshine falls apart is a common ailment of many ensemble pictures: a loss of balance between the different characters and their plots. If you enjoyed Cillian Murphy in 28 Days Later and wish to see him again, this is the film for you. Otherwise, the rest of the cast has moments, just moments to ""shine""."
2,"Visually stunning, otherwise derivative and annoying","Although it had been recommended by a very sophisticated friend, I found Sunshine to be derivative and annoying. It drives me up the wall when characters make decisions that seem implausible, out of character, or just plain stupid. The plot of Sunshine is driven by such decisions. Add to that unnecessarily gruesome scenes, weak physics, and a predictable plot and you get a teeth-gritting experience.That said, the visuals are stunning, and as much as I was irritated, at the end my heart was pounding. If you are looking for a sci-fi thriller and can maintain suspension of disbelief for a couple of hours, you might love it."
2,High hopes dashed...,"Given its trailer and Boyle's credentials I though this should be REALLY good...it started out great - the cast is terrific, the camera work is superb and the musical score is top notch. Too bad the film degenerates into something less than it should be by the time it's over. Lots of questions as to who and why the main protagonist is and acts the way he does abound, stupid plot contrivances, and a sense of lost focus plague this movie in the last half hour. I'm disappointed with this one."
1,Sunshine turns out to be a dark movie,"Too bad I didn't read all these one star reviews before buying Sunshine. They are right on for why this movie is a dud. I came away scratching my head because it had everything needed to be great. Excellent special effects, a beautiful space craft, a decent storyline and some good actors. Yet it all ends up as garbage.What it lacks is creativity. It never draws you into the story. In fact as someone else stated it's difficult to follow along. One scene after another is stolen from other movies. It tries to be everything and fails at everything. All the actors come off as supporting cast. No one takes the lead. Well in the end one actor gets the job by default.Throw in a bit of blood and guts and this comes off as a cheap horror flick. And as another reviewer points out it isn't even good at that."
4,Strange but good,"For the life of me I can't say why I keep watching this movie over and over but I do.The first time I watched it I didn't pay much attention and it caught my interest at the end so I had to re-watch it. Then I started picking apart the physics and although there are the normal Hollywood stupidities - the overall physics are not too shabby (compared to most sci-fi's). Then I just enjoyed the movie having picked it apart...This is a movie worthy of time and attention. Its attractive in a dark, strange sort of way (ironic that its about bright sunshine and I find it a little dark... :-) ) Overall, this is a movie worth owning - not perfect but watchable more then once."
1,Sony Blu-ray Player owners beware!,"Haven't gotten to see the movie... it could be awesome... however, I'm one of many people with a Sony Blu-ray player who can't watch the movie because I can't turn off a Picture in Picture feature. Its been a while and folks have complained to Sony. Sony says it's not their problem. I say it is Sony's problem, because I'll refuse to buy another darned thing made by Sony because of this."
1,Sunshine,"BAD, it sucked and should be free. bad bad bad bad badbad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad crapp crapp really bad."
3,More polish required,"It would be like a modern version of nightmare on Elm street with Freddy Krueger doing a guest appearance in this film. That's what made it cheesy.It would have been better to have the ships computer as the antagonist convincing the other ships computer to turn against the crew like HAL in the movie 2001. In the final analysis I can only say ""I'm afraid Dave"" this movie is half baked."
4,Inspiring - despite and because of major flaws,"I really enjoyed watching this movie - for three times up to now. Despite the major flaws in its storyline, there are plenty of reasons for that (and I don't mean the ending scene, which is gorgeous also from a open-minded physical standpoint of view): The opening scene. The visualization of the sun. The score. And the well-defined use of visual effects. But one question remains: WHY, OH WHY not avoid the numerous logical errors? I hope that there will someday be a director for a remake who knows something about science - or who stoops to ask a scientist. Because this could have been one of the best SF movies ever, not just one of the most beautiful ones."
4,Solid sci-fi allegory with strong performances,"Think ""Heart of Darkness"" in space. And, instead of 'Darkness,' brightness is the ironic twist.The film takes some surreal turns, and the biggest mistake a viewer could make would be to cling to disbelief or nitpick away at the 'science' of it all. The cast is a solid collection of familiar faces, and the film sends them off into themes of heroism, sacrifice, and desperation. Visual effects are great, and we have a classic soundtrack here that has since shown up in any number of other films, trailers, TV shows, etc.The Blu-ray presentation looks and sounds great. Extras are satisfying. If you enjoy the film, you can't go wrong with a Blu-ray copy. If you are unsure of a 'blind buy,' definitely rent first."
3,NOT 28 Days Later in Outer Space,"Folks;If you liked 28 Days Later and enjoyed the suspense and were intrigued by the role of Cillian Murphey, this review may be helpful to you. Firsy of all, this is not 28 Days Later, in spite of a few pretty good moments of ""horror shock."" I give this movie ""A"" for its original premise, ""B"" for its characters but a ""C"" for its overall storyline and execution. Wait until it's on ""FearNet."""
3,Sunshine - One off,"The science was beyond my suspension of disbelief, as too was the lack of discipline of the crew to carry on with, what was presented as, a must succeed endeavor."
5,Excellent new LDS themed artist,"I've always enjoyed listening to LDS themed music-from Kenneth Cope to Michael McLean. Taylor Anderson's One Little Miracle is a perfect fit for those relaxing Sunday moments. Taylor's created a wonderful mix of Christ centered, church, mission, family, and love themed songs with thoughtful and uplifting lyrics. I rank this album at the top of my must have LDS music."
3,"Good, But Not Great","I like Mark Fuhrman's books very much. I also have great empathy for him as the scapegoat of the O. J. Simpson trial.The problem with this book is that Mr. Fuhrman was not privy to most of the details of the investigation while it was ongoing. So in other words, rather than being a detective, he's a journalist here, and largely left out of the loop. Since the police did not share their information with him, he was forced to second-guess what was going on much of the time, which made for a frustrating read.When I saw the title of the book, I had naively assumed that Mr. Fuhrman was called in as a consultant and would have been able to provide a fuller explanation of what went on in this case."
1,Boastful and repetitive,"As an author, Fuhrman falls short. I am a true crime buff, however, I could not even finish reading this. Even though we all know that prostitues live a high risk lifestyle, I understand mentioning in a book with this topic, however, how many times must I read about it? At least twice (remember, I didn't finish the book) I read how high risk their lifestyle is.Also, so, he was involved in the Simpson case, let it go. If I wanted to read about that or the Moxley case, I would have gotten a book on those topics.I believe if you are a true crime buff, as I am, you should not waste your time on this one."
5,AWESOME! and I found it again!!!,"This ""Off TROPICAL Fresh"" one is just.... AMAZING.first of all,I have 3 kids who just HATE mosquito repellent because of the smell and stingy irritation to their eyes and nose.every time I apply ANY repellent, they just start crying begging me NOT to use it.They say they'd rather get mosquito bites(that much they hate the yucky smell of most repellents)BUT!Not anymore- This is just great!Kids LOVE the smell, They don't resist, and they don't get mosquito bites!for a while(about 2 years), I couldn't find this specific product ANYWHERE, butI found it again!!!!!! (at the walmart)I'm SUPER happy this summer again!!!! (my kids as well!)"
2,Very basic no good R-134a information,Very basic. Does not include much information on R-134a - which is surprising since R-134a has been the industry standard for so long now. The manual is in serious need of updating.
1,You must buy this book!,"When the real estate implosion is in full swing, garbage like this will be a collector's item!Seriously, don't read this garbage. David Lereah is a joke."
1,Bad Timing,"LOL - this guy needs some way of making money, so he's hoping people will buy his book. I'd say his days at NAR are now numbered since he's been cheerleading the housing market for years, just recently headed up the $40M campaign to get more fools to buy a house, then stated that the market bubble has popped.Quotes from him from mid-November:`The biggest question I'm faced with is how far do prices have to drop and how long will it take for the correction to finally turn around in [those] markets. I don't have an answer,'`You'd have to go back to the Great Depression to find a housing period that is this unique.'Ouch - yeah, ""now is a great time to buy or sell a house"" - ROFLMAO!"
1,If only there were 'zero stars'...,"Think of the worst, most run-down cardboard box with a mailbox in front of it. According to the author's logic, in just a few years it will be worth a million dollars. Reject that notion, and you must reject pretty much everything David Lereah says in his book. As others have said, this is a man with a vested interest in the market going up and staying up, to the exclusion of all else. I've read his 'expert' opinions of the market elsewhere and find he has no credibility, much less foresight into the future of the housing market. Give it a pass, or if you must read it for laughs, buy it used so that you aren't adding any money to his bank account."
1,In the implosion zone ....,"I found this title by accident, and the irony was too great to pass up. We are signing the closing documents tomorrow on a house here in Sonoma County, CA that is down 36% from when it last sold in November 2006. The house is a foreclosure, owned by IndyMac Bank, stock price $0.06 per share at this writing.Added hilarity comes from the two testimonials, one gushing from a former govenor of the federal reserve, the other equally non-reasoned from the Chief Economist of Fannie Mae. Oops, they just got taken into receivership by the Treasury Department!Unfortunately real people were harmed by this advice. Buyer beware, of course, but you would think folks in positions of authority would have a little more temperance. But then you would have thought wrong. Maybe that's why I have so little respect for authority ..."

1,"Book recalls past exuberance, not current reality","From this book:""Can you increase your wealth [from the real estate boom]? The answer is a resounding yes.""...real estate is poised to climb higher over the next decade...and continue to outpace other investments"" And so on throughout this book.So, how is that investment strategy going, Mr. Lereah? Let's let Lereah answer that in his own words, as spoke to a group of 400 Florida realtors on Thursday, April 27th:""The region's real estate economy must recover from a hangover wrought by a spasm of speculation and easy money""Has this book's thinking at all contributed to this ""spasm of speculation?"" Does Lereah's right hand know what his left hand is doing? Buyer beware."
5,My first review,"Uhm, the book arrived on time, and its exactly what I wanted it.About the book, I think its hilarious, it really interesting to read this book, now that the housing market has crashed."
1,"Dear Author, you were 100% worng",Why is Amazon still selling this book when it's obvious that the author was completely wrong? I hope that this loser is not continuing to make money from his snake oil.
5,A classic,"At a time when Industrial was an up and coming genre (circa 1989-91 and an industrial night could be found at most cool clubs) these boys were at the forefront. Nitzer Ebb helped evolve dance music. The words, ""Join in the Chant"" could be heard in nightclubs around the world (from Limelight in New York City to Hard Club at Gossips in London) as angry disenchanted youth found an outlet for their angst."
5,Great Book,"This book helped through a really difficult point in my life. Nate makes this book a really easy read. It is packed with knowledge, but it breezes by. You feel like you in a conversation with him. Anyone who is going though a trying time should read this book."
4,Rather long but entertaining,"I loved the convoluted comic plot, the dead body that never stinks no matter how far it's carted around, and all of the characters' antics.I didn't love how many words it took to communicate those things."
1,Barely adequate,"I just wanted hard copy of a text I had already on Kindle, and this barely provided it. It was clearly just the Project Gutenberg transcription poured onto the page with no attempt to match the layout or formatting of the original publication. This is especially noticeable in a section where, in the original, one of the characters lists pros and cons in two parallel columns. There are no columns here, just items 1, 1, 2, 2, and so on interlaced.I wished I had noted the physical size of the book before ordering: this paperback is an odd 8"" x 10"" size as compared to the standard 5"" x 8"" trade paperback. It would have been pleasanter to handle and a more satisfactory heft in the smaller size. The cover photo is totally irrelevant to the subject and seems to have been chosen at random.This was about what one might expect from a POD product, but I ended up ordering a used copy of an actual print edition for my permanent library."
5,Fine acoustic music,"This is one of those albums which stay with you over the years. I've been listening to this work now for some 24 years and it's still as fresh, new, and satisfying as the day when it was first released. It features some of Jorma Kaukonen's finest, most thoughtful and exquisitely executed guitar work, poetic lyrics and memorable, haunting melodies melded together in a number of fine original songs, and a number of covers that are just as good as they can get. Also added are the vocal talents of bassist Tom Hobson on two of the songs on the B-side. Devotees of wooden music, San Fransisco music, all music, will find this album a delight."
5,Sound Waves takes me back ... what a wonderful sound!!,"I was a 14 year old girl when the Beatles first came to the US and I fell in love with their 'sound' as so many did back then!! Listening to Michael Fargnoli's ""Sound Waves"", I find he has that same unique sound or essence as the Beatles did, yet there's no doubt there's an added special magic all his own that only adds to the remarkable sound of this CD. I enjoy his music listening in my car as much as sitting in front of a fire with a glass of wine! A very wonderful style, and most enjoyable album!!"
3,good rhythm and blues guitar man,"Good guitar man,..... the songs are not bad,..though the legacy of old zeppelin is still alive"
3,BLAND EFFORT FROM THE MASTER,"Outrider was disappointing, and preceded the re-release of the Led Zep masters. The story goes that Jimmy Page's master tapes for a double or triple album were stolen from his home - leading him to recompose this effort. The basic idea of doing three styles - hard rock, instrumental and blues are here - and the blues numbers are the best. But the guitar work is strangely bland. As one reviewer puts it, this is an uneven work. Plant's improvised ""The Only One"" doesn't do anything and John Miles - the vocalist - would do a far better job singing live on tour with Page. The album also sounds too clean. No grit whatsoever. I rate this 2 and a half stars...."
3,Good...the crunch is back.,"Quite a competent solo offering from Page with an eye to the past.John Miles sounds a lot better than Plant here,he should have sung all the songs."
3,Good Survival information,"Ok so the hype of Y2K was much overblown. This product is about survival. It has a lot of good information. Its information is applicable for earthquake, hurricane, flood, or any other type of disaster. Its a bargain and I don't suspect there are many copies around. Please consider adding this to your Library. The copy that I have is very valuable to me."
4,slim & soft,I like that it softer and slimmer than Huggies. It helps me know when I should change my son diapers. I only wish it has elastic in the back to protect the leak soil.
4,Y&T contagious is contagious!,Y&T; is a smoking rock band and even though this albumwas slick in production that doesn't mean it doesn'trock. It has some classic Y&T; songs. I saw them on thistour and they were awesome. Try listening to I'll Cryfor you and tell me Dave's not one if not the best guitarplayer in rock history. So chill out and relax and givethis another listen and enjoy some great rock by Y&T;.
3,"Average, But Still Fun To Listen To","I've always thought that this was a pretty good album. Y&T released one of my favorite videos of all time off of this album; that being the title song ""Contagious."" Great song and video. As for the rest of the album, it's not the most original album, but still the music is played well and it's a fun CD to listen to. Other noteworthy songs are ""Temptation,"" and ""Armed and Dangerous."" The backing vocals are real energetic the entire album, and so is the music and production. My favorite Y&T album. Music that's great to play driving in your car on a summer day."
5,Great Beans,"Great if you want to try a variety of beans! All of mine were from South America, but I didn't mind. I've only roasted one batch but it turned out just fine."
1,This release has horrible mastering,"When I pay $30.00 for a ""remastered"" title, I expect that some care and expertise were taken in the mastering process. This release has neither. I had to turn my volume knob almost completely down just to listen to this cd. There is so much compression that the drums sound squashed. I wonder what master tapes, if any were used.What a shame to ruin such a good album with this shoddy release."
5,great self defense for sport people,"i bought this book because as a BJJ student, we practice mostly sport without any kind of striking. i don't want to join another gym because i already pay enough to train where i am so this book helped a lot to show me some simple ways to adjust the moves i'm learning when someone is punching or kicking. its the easiest book out there to learn from for people like me who have the goal of adding this awareness to BJJ."
2,Oversold and Underdelivered,"I am a martial arts instructor who is wanting to incorporate some basic Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu into my curriculum for self-defense purposes. After reading all of the glowing reviews about this book and DVD being ""straight and to the point"" and how Simco just shows the street-effective techniques I thought this would be the right resource to utilize.I was wrong.I am very disappointed in the skimpy material in this book, all of which is designed for use by a very strong fighter in an MMA competition, not a normal sized individual on the street. Also, the DVD is nothing more than an advertisement for his other DVD sets. Seriously, there are only 3 techniques on the DVD (about 10 minutes worth) and the rest is previews without instruction for his other products.The techniques he does show are good if you are an MMA fighter, though there are not a lot of them. If you are looking for a self-defense book, I suggest buying something else."
5,Dragon Blood,"Patricia Briggs is a wonderful writer and I've enjoyed each and every book that I've bought of hers--this one included. She has a marvelous imagination and the ability to bring the reader into the story. Her books are hard to put down--no, that's wrong, they're impossible to put down.Mary Veelle"
1,save your money,what junk! you cant throw it far enough. You need to go to an hvac supply and they will sell you one for $75 or so that actually works.
3,Lumberjack Story,"The book is ok, just a little tedious in parts. It's more of a historical rambling, with interesting anecdotes."
1,CHI Pro Hairdryer,"This hairdryer stopped blowing hot air after 9 months, and at over $100, I expected it to last much longer. When I contacted CHI, they said there is no warranty on items sold on the internet, as only salons are authorized sellers. After searching for a fix on the internet, all I found were other reviews saying that the hairdryer died out in 6-9 months or started on fire! I will not purchase this brand again."
5,good hair days,"I have coarse, thick hair, it gets frizzy easily and coloring for the past 15 years doesn't help. I have noticed since using the Chi dryer, my hair doesn't frizz easily ( I live in the Florida, the humidity is a nightmare for my hair) and my hair is a lot smoother. Since it is only 1300 watt, the dryer is not too noisy and my hair doesn't seem as damaged as it used to be. Even though it is a 1300 watt dryer, it does dry your hair quickly and makes it shiney."
4,Worth the money,"I purchased this dryer a month ago and was struggling with the idea of spending this much money on a hair dryer. With the low wattage I was also worried it would take longer to dry my hair. My hair dries faster with this dryer than my previous 1875 watt dryer and is worth the money. I'm even considering buying a 2nd one for my teenage daughters. My only complaint is minor. Due to the structure/location of the high/off/low switch, my hand sometimes triggers the switch when I'm drying my hair. However, overall this dryer is comfortable in my hand."
4,Great blow dryer but I wish it had more power,The blow dryer is great especially for kids who don't like the loud sounds of blow dryers. I wish it was just a bit stronger/faster with the drying. I am still happy I bought it.
1,"Poor Quality, Not Worth The Price.","Bought this hair dryer thinking it would be a high quality item (hence the price). Is not that powerful or hot to begin with. Long story short the warranty is one year and mine burned out (no heat) after exactly 13 months of infrequent use. Buy something cheaper that won't be such a disappointment when it fails.And yes this is/was a true CHI product (not a knock-off). It's just a piece of crap. Maybe the knock-offs are better than the ""real"" made in China CHI products?"
1,Poor Quality. Not Worth The Price.,"Bought this hair dryer thinking it would be a high quality item (hence the price). Is not that powerful or hot to begin with. Long story short the warranty is one year and mine burned out (no heat) after exactly 13 months of infrequent use. I suggest you buy something cheaper that won't be such a disappointment when it fails. Many people have been having trouble with this product.By the way; yes this is/was a true CHI product (not a knock-off). It's just a piece of crap. Maybe the knock-offs are better than the ""real"" CHI products?"
2,Only blows cold air,"I would highly recommend another blow dryer. I purchased this blow dryer a little over a year ago for my fiance, she did like to while it lasted. Problem is it didn't...It now only blows cold air. I contacted the company and they told me sorry the product is no longer under warranty. I don' know... I guess when you spend double what most blow dryers cost you kinda expect a little more. Its now on the way to the garbage dump were it belongs..."
1,Do NOT purchase this dryer!,"I was sucked in by the positive reviews of this product, but unfortunately, this didn't work any better than a $20 dryer from Target. I've been using it for the past 15 months and, like several other reviews stated, the heating element failed. So now I'm out $80 and just went back to Target and bought a Conair for $20. Would NOT recommend this product."
5,Naturally wavy hair? Not anymore!,"This dryer is fantastic!!! Worth every penny. I have naturally wavy hair that I usually blow dry straight and use a curling iron to finish off my style. Using a straightener has never worked because any humidity in the air would always cause some frizzage. With my CHI, I don't even have to use a curling iron or straightener after drying. My hair stays straight and keeps my style just from drying. My friend had a CHI and I used it once and fell in love. I have always just bought my dryers at Target before and never thought I would spend this kind of money on a hair dryer, because I never knew what a difference it really made. Love, LOVE it!!"
2,Short Lived,When I first bought this I was excited because CHI is supposed to make a quality product. Boy was I wrong. It worked fine like any regular dryer would except that it dried my hair a lot faster than my old dryer and quiet considering it was a more powerful dryer. Those are probably the only differences. For the money I had higher expectations. After 1 year the heating element died!!! A dryer this pricey should have lasted several years. Thankfully I didn't throw out my old Conair which I went back to using. I've had the Conair for almost 9 years and probably paid less than half for the CHI. Not worth the money I paid.
3,"Not exactly a gripping book, but enjoyable and informative.","Tho the writing is a little stilted and some of the 'horrors' Chris Costner had to endure were a little lame, I can understand that they were not, for her, of no consequence. The book gave a lot of understanding into how women were treated in the time period - and how poorly understood mental problems have been in the past, the very real dangers of admitting to mental problems, and having them treated by people who are more interested in publishing and ego pumping than in curing the afflicted.While the book did not grip my interest firmly, it was an enjoyable book, informative and with things I did not know and found to be educational."
4,"Visceral, pounding, involving rock and roll instrumentals","This is kinda like the Dictators without Adny Shernoff's lyrics. It's rock and roll, boys and girls, and Ross the Boss slays the wavelengths with pure, thick chords. That said, it's a nice touch when every once in awhile a Rickenbacher sound enters the mix. Even better is the variety of sounds you get here. It all rocks, sure enough, but there's a change of pace thrown in here and there, background vocals exhorting the crew to higher heights and the drumming. Ah yes, the drumming. Never flashy, always perfect, like the minister's daughter. My only complaint is the mastering. Maxed out it is. The music is already max volume. I would prefer to up the volume to get extra thrills myself, thank you. As it is, turning this beauty up leads to beastly ear pain instead of instant analogue aural nirvana. Slight complaint, though. In fact, I think I'll play it again."
3,Almost usable,"I was really looking forward to this watch, and ditching my pager. Unfortunately, the 100 Char limit on messages means I can't use it. Particularly when you forward an email to it, you get very little data. I get the senders' email address, the subject, and the last few lines of the email (usually just the signature line) and I miss the important part of the message.Otherwise it is a great watch."
1,Bad choice for dial up users,"I installed this program and it is continuously trying to activate my dial up connection even after registering the product. I am also having no success updating the virus definition files. Safeworld has a patch, so obviously there is a problem, although they do not make the patch easily available. The email support is slow (still waiting after 4 days). Now they want me to go into my registry and add a line. I should not have to do this. This can be quite dangerous for novice users."
1,Not very pleased.,"The movie is quite short, has a happy ending, and an enviromental message. Nothing really seems to pace well, the animation is choppy, and the voices are not what I would call enjoyable. This is more chopped up then the Disney version, and much sappier. I perfer the Little Mermaid (UAV Corporation) version MUCH better, ASIN: B00005QW6QDont' let the crummy box art fool you; the UAV version is a vintage animation with delightful animation and the original ending."
1,Not the real deal!,"If you sre looking for the Anime style Little mermaid, The one with the sad ending, please note that this is not it! Now I havent seen this film but I'm sure it's fine lust not the one most people are looking for. The origanal in DVD format has a realy stupid cover but some nice person gave a few captures so I am sure that it's the one you're looking for. The cover is mainly blue with a blond haired mermaide who looks nouthing like Merina playing with some fish. The titel on the top of the page reads 'The Little Mermaid (UAV Corporation) (2000)' and if you look at the extra pics someone put up and reed the revews you'll not make the mistake of buying the wrong film. Hope this helps good luch!"
2,A mess,"Seems like views are mixed on this 'snake release, and for me, this is one big dud. I liked the old bluesy 'snake, but the album ""Whitesnake"", with John Sykes playing some absolutely storming guitar, and great drumming from Aynsley Dunbar set a new bar.This album is a horrible mess. Many of the songs that others seem to like (Judgement Day, Sailing Ships) are incredibly poor. They are a musically all over the place veering between styles. Vai's playing is completely out of character with most of the songs. For me, I prefer the dumb, but at least ""straight ahead"" songs like ""Kitten's got claws"" on this album.You don'y need to get this album unless a) you are a Steve Vai fan, and don't mind that his playing is disconnected from the song playing, or b) your just want to complete your Coverdale collection. For people new to David Coverdale -- start at Deep Purple's ""Burn"" and progress from there."
4,Bottom line: Vai is a brilliant guitarist,"Much has been said about the incongruity of Steve Vai's guitar playing with Whitesnake's traditional vibe, and it's 100% true. Still, the overall effect on ""Slip of the Tongue"" is elevational. The fact is a lot of the songs on this album are mediocre, and Vai breathes fresh life into them. A few tracks are pathetic beyond hope (""Cheap an' Nasty,"" ""Kitten's Got Claws,"" ""Slow Poke Music""), but they do not represent the album's general feel. ""Fool for Your Loving"" (the only song that continues the Whitesnake legacy), ""Wings of the Storm,"" ""Judgement Day,"" and ""Sailing Ships"" are fantastically good and owe much of their appeal to Vai's virtuosity."
5,Packed full of detailed information.,"This is an old (mine is from 1947) Sewing book. ""A goldmine of needle know how"". It has information on everything sewing, including: the basics, finishes, potholders, linens, curtains, bedspreads, slip covers, collars, dickeys, bags, scarf, babies, tailor's tricks, how to draft patterns, as well as many other detailed instructions. It has over 500 illustrations that show each process clearly, and 350 pages. They don't write them like this anymore. I love mine!"
3,Misleading Title -but OK for your first,"I suppose as a beginner, my knowledge is already pretty advanced. At least, the concepts are familiar. Typos in the editing aside, this book isn't bad. I thought the CD was a waste, since all of this software is easily obtainable on the web, and contributed to the cost of the book.I had already purchased Beginning PHP 4 from wrox and everything covered in Mr Tansley's book was available in there. I thought that book was superior as a reference and introduction to the concepts of PHP and mySQL, and would recommend it first.If you are looking for a book (as I still am) that details more database development on the backend to create a site, this is not the book. Don't be mislead by the title to assume into believing it marries mySQL and PHP from the beginning."
3,You can take a girl out of the city....,"This film was a great film for anyone older then 10 or 12.It chronicles the story of Whitney Brown who is living life HIGH with parents who are apart of America's rich.Then one day her father loses his job and they are bankrupt..Whitney's school President life is turned upside down in an instant.And only then does she find out who her true friends really are.Forgiveness, reconciliation, adapting to new surroundings and many other themes play out in this film.Due to some scary scenes I wouldn't recommend for all ages but anyone older the 10 will be fine."
2,Disappointing....,"After reading the 4 reviews already on here, I was looking forward to seeing this movie. I was disappointed and found the beautiful Gypsy Vanner horse the only thing I really cared for in the movie. Yes, the movie DID teach valuable lessons, but in a very unrealistic way. I've had horses for over 50 years and, believe me, they do NOT behave like this horse. They are wonderful, perfect animals but this was way beyond anything that would happen in real life. And riding a horse to a dance in Philadelphia....please. Also, utterly, beyond belief, was the horse helping Whitney hop a train.....oh my..... The movie could have taught the same life lessons without being so ridiculously unrealistic......."
4,You don't have to be a child to enjoy this movie,"Tommie Turvey caught my attention as the trainer of the Clydesdales for the 2013 Superbowl Bud commercial. I found out he had trained the real star of this movie, Bob, the Gypsy Vanner horse, so I had to see the results. I always enjoy watching trained horses and how they respond, but this movie was a joy to watch in general. It does a service of keeping horses in the eyes and hearts of young people. We are becoming an increasingly urban society with little heart for animals. Movies like this help a lot. Thanks!"
2,How do you go from Van Halen to ELO?,On Extreme's last CD they were moving away from Van Halen and when III Sides to Every Story comes out they were ELO. How does that happen? They had a 3 part orchestra at the end of the CD. It's been years since I listened to the CD but I remember it being overproduced and underwritten. Yet it was well played. Extreme is a confusing band. I walked away before this CD was released. Burn your friends copy. You will be better off.
3,Spoken: On Your Feet,"The last time I had heard the cd I was a teen, and I was still able to derive enjoyment listening to it after a decade. Maybe that could be an indication of my inability to mature, but I think its safe to say I'm not alone. Not the best of what I've heard from Spoken, but good to bang your head too. Being a Christian that still likes who likes rock, its good to hear something that has lyrics that don't betray your faith."
4,i like the simpsons,"when i was a kid this was my favorit cd (although i had it on tape) anyroad if you like the simpsons this cd is great for you. my favorite songs are deep deep trouble, and springfield soul stew. that and surronded by idiots. pretty fun."
4,Mixed Bag,"This unit works very well. The soft-touch buttons on the remote have a great feel and the groups (labelled ""moods"") give a real versatility to the controls. This device works with my existing X-10 modules with no problems.Unfortunately, the base will not work with my existing X-10 remotes. I bought this to replace a broken X-10 base and am very disappointed to find the unit only works with Black and Decker Freewire remotes. Since none of the Black and Decker remotes allow for dimming of lamp modules, this creates a problem.If you don't need dimming, then you'll love this unit. If you need dimming or already have other remotes, look elsewhere."
5,skywalkers,"I got this for easter it lights up dim but in the dark it rocks. It is very nice to duel, but it dosent collapse fully.A major desipointment for halloween soundeffects are awsome the clash is great. I would buy this with the darth vader electronic and luke fx lightsabers,and obi-wan kanobi lightsabers............."
4,No problem with the product,"Received on time...no issues till now. However, customer service of this vendor is poor. I tried calling this vendor 3-4 times (at differeent times in a day) to add one more similar item but didn't get anyone over the phone."
1,Bad Bunk,"I have just a very few words to say about this not too inventive construct "" Its undeniably the most implausible book i've ever read on any subject "" ."
5,Budget Messiah a Great Bargain,"To get soprano Julianne Baird and the excellent bass Kevin Deas--two of the finest young singers on the Early Music Scene now--on a budget Messiah and get all their arias, plus some excellent choral work from this Philadelphia-based baroque group, is a fantastic Christmas gift.Despite the occasional eccentricity of tempo and phrasing, the Romanian conductor Radu gives a lively performance in a neat space. For Ms. Baird and G.F. Handel, one expects to pay full price. This is a great find. Go for it!"
4,Gran interpretación a precio inmejorable,"Esta versión de la misa en Si menor de Bach es una de las mejores que he escuchado, a pesar de que la sección de trompetas tiene un inicio algo errático en el GLORIA, pero se recupera en el resto de la obra. La voz del bajo Kevin Deas en el ET IN SPIRITUM es una de las más claras que haya escuchado en esta obra, y solo por este segmento bien vale el precio que se paga. Los comentarios de Radu a la obra son muy especializados, fuera del alcance de quien apenas comienza a escuchar este tipo de música, pero de gran valor para el estudioso. Muy recomendable."
3,"Good, but...","Is is a quite good recording of the Mass os Bach, but I missed a lot a booklet. Music fans like reading about the works. But if you dont mind it, it is a good choice for a reasonable price"
5,An American pulp icon,"Unlike Doc Savage, whose complete run was reprinted in paperback, only about 25 of the 325 Shadow pulps were reprinted. The Shadow deserves better. In this adventure, Thade the Death Giver is arranging murders on the New York transit system. The Shadow and his band track the killer but not before multiple murders and terrific action. The Shadow is a must for any mystery fan."
1,Second Monitor,"I have three children, so I thought purchasing the extra monitor plus the extra camera would be a great idea.....not so, the first monitor works great solo. However, when I added the new monitor static was overwhelming. We placed this in many different locations in the room and still no luck. I tried just using the new monitor with the extra camera and the new monitor worked great....solo. When you add this additional camera get ready for massive static. I will be returning this item. Hope this helps."
5,Iittala Pepper mill,"The pepper mill is perfect. Easy to turn handle coupled to a really smooth turning grinding mechanism. It's easy to fill...just pull up on the handle and pour in the pepper. I have arthritis in my hands and my old pepper mill was hard to hold onto and turn. The handle on this pepper mill is easy to grasp and turn.The design of the pepper mill is really sleek and modern...so it looks much cooler than anybody elses pepper mill. When was the last time somebody noticed your pepper mill? Well, people comment on mine...and consistantly say how cool it looks.I loved it so much, I also got the salt mill to match it. They are worth the few extra bucks considering you'll have them for decades."
4,Great way to recycle old Notebook hard drives,"This is a really smart piece of aftermarket engineering, it turns old notebook harddrives into really handy, very flexible USB storage devices, which work well on both a MAC and other operating systems. The only issue is when you are using it on A PC, it frequently causes an excessive power drain on the USB bus. There is a little socket for a power supply, but who wants to carry around yet another power supply. This problem never occurs on a MAC. Additionally, if you are migrating from one machine to another, you can pull the HD out of the old one and have all your files available to you if you, which is handy if you don't like to just copy everything over."
5,wonderful selection of stories,"the best thing about this book is the sheer variety of really good stories. no one type of SF dominates the book: cyberpunk, hard Arthur C. Clarke-style (gossamer), far-future space opera all occupy space in this novel. and the stories are all worthy of notice. hartwell edits good anthologies. if you like horror, check out ""the dark descent."""
2,Slightly dissapointed.,"I really love this period od English history. So, I was very excited when my husband got me this for Christmas...However, I am slightly dissapointed.Pro:It is detailed and accurate.The Visuals are really good.Cons:The narrator isnt good.The music over takes he audio and it makes it hard to hear the narration.I kept having to pause and explain things to my husband (who is unfamiliar with the middle ages). I was hoping to enjoy this more.Its not the worst but certainly not the best documentary I have seen."
3,here we go again!!,"I believe very strongly that tangerine dream fans NEED to continue to be VERY careful before buying ""new"" releases of TD. It concerns me that sometime very soon, we are going to be buying compilations OF compilations put out by TD. If Edgar has run out of ideas for new music, maybe it's time for him to think ""retirement"" or maybe it's just become time to pass the TD torch over to Jerome.. We just aren't getting any new stuff. On the other hand, if you're new to TD, then by all means get this album...It has a lot of good music on it but for this TD fan who's been listening for more than twenty years, this just smells of greed by Edger who has seemingly and unfortunately run out of new ideas and is trying to make as much money as possible before he finally DOES retire...Sorry, Not trying to be overly negative here but it sure is getting tedious to have to buy an entire album just to get one or two NEW songs."
5,Very Soothing!,"This lotion replaced the ""Naked Bee"" brand in my home because it is more soothing; furthermore, it has a more natural fragrance as opposed to an artificial fragrance. It's a thick lotion, so a little does go a long way. Also, the bottle is fairly large, which makes it a great value for the money!"
5,Love it! Love it!,I love tea tree oil it is a very good product. I would recommend it to anyone who has irritated skin.
4,Almost great,"Shawn Phillips is one of the great underappreciated singer-songwriters of the ""singer-songwriter era."" He's still making music, and hasn't really strayed from his roots. Here's my complaint: FACES, probably his greatest older album, in my searches, has never been transferred to CD. It's strange, especially considering there are at least a couple of tracks here from that record, including the great ""Hey Miss Lonely."" Also, sixteen songs cannot nearly cover the range of somber, whimsical, and lyrical numbers Phillips has put out over the years, and a larger ""best of"" voulume is perhaps necessary. Anyway, a valuable pick-up, especially if you like some music you can sing along with."
5,If you have not heard the music of Shawn Phillips do so now!,"Shawn Phillips is an awesome writing force who has gone unnoticed to the mainstream music market. His craft defies any given style, yet encompasses many diverse cultural backgrounds. His music is profound, lyrical, sensitive and sensual, moody and aggressive. Phillips is a true poet as revealed by his extensive textural lyrics.What a shame that only two or three of his vast discography has been edited on CD. Shawn Phillips' music must and will be rediscovered by future generations of serious music lovers."
4,"Excellent, since I can't find Faces","Most of the songs here a good choices except a couple from the disco era which sound really dated and, well, discoee. Take them off and you have a great hits album."
1,Ish,"I have one word to describe this album... Ish. I love Cher, I have every album she's ever put out and I can honestly say this album is gross. Maybe it's just that it's terribly dated (as most Cher CDs are). It's just sound so uninspired. Sounds like a bunch of crappy songs that didn't make the cut for her previous 3 albums (Heart of Stone, Cher and I Paralyze), so they stuck them all on this one.Although the songs suck, Cher's voice is powerful. She belts it out into that microphone with her background Christian-rock style chorus. Vocally this album is great. Still, Cher's voice can't save this album. The keyboards and sappy songs ruin it and any potential it had.I still love Cher. She still rocks. But if you're thinking about buying this album, save your money, it'll just gross you out."
5,One of my Top 10 Christmas CD's,"This CD does everything well - the big orchestral arrangements that are fun and swingy, the hauntingly beautiful religious songs she wrote, the softer acoustic numbers. She doesn't make any bad choices here and there's maximum style with minimal schmaltz. I'd never purchased any of her music before but consider this in my top 10 of Christmas CD's, which is saying a lot because I've collected a ton of Christmas music over the years."
5,An Absolute Classic,"This album is simply top rate. Everything is done well--choice of songs, composition of the original songs, arrangements, orchestration, performances, even the album art and photography. Especially enjoyable are the lush orchestral treatments of the classics and the exquisite original songs. Amy has always been a great songwriter, and this album contains two of her best: Breath of Heaven and Emmanuel, God With Us. Phil Keaggy's guitar on O Come All Ye Faithful and its gentle, beautiful arrangement also deserve mention. If there's one Christmas CD you'll want to put on Repeat, this is it."
3,It does work...,"I got this little MP3 CD player when it went on a great sale because my old CD player was five or more years old and didn't really work. I never listen to my CDs anymore, but I was going on a long plane ride/bus trip so I needed something to listen to.There are skips, some songs that it will refuse to play, and doesn't work too well upside down. Mine had a tendancy to just turn off for no apparent reason, even if it had fresh batteries and the buttons locked. Oh, and the locker is cheap. It kept un-locking and then the player would turn on and run the batteries dry.Not a huge problem and served me well on my trip. It's now gathering dust and will probably get chucked next time I trip over it.Great for trips/children who break things/people who want a cheap MP3 CD player. NOT great for music conesueirs or people who move a lot. Whether it is for you, I don't know."
3,Caveat Emptor (to a degree),I have the CDP-3002 which is the latest version of this model it has 120 second anti-skip for mp3s and 45 second for cds. It works well except that when you first put a cd in it takes up to 46 seconds for the anti skip buffer to fill itself. Also it is useless for running since it is continuously being bounced (for that you may want to buy a solid state MP3 player). I haven't tried it slung over a treadmill but I suspect it will be ok for that. In a car it is fine and I am satisfied with that. But you may also want to go get rechargable batteries as it will get a maximum of 10 hours out of it (and that is without using ESP or the dynamic bass)
5,"More, please!","Jamie Rounds is a remarkable musician. His ""Ten Great Car Tunes"" (nearly his alone, including instrumentals, lyrics, and vocals) gets better every time I listen to it. The lyrics range from fun to philosophical, and often catch you off guard with simple, disarming honesty. His melodies pull you in, follow you around throughout the day, and are beautifully enhanced by his harmonies. The variety too is impressive, from pop and rock and roll (to which you can't help but move) to sweet acoustic. And it is all powerfully supported by his skill with guitars (the CD includes two really fine instrumentals). I fully trust it will leave you, as it left me, hoping for much more music from this very talented man."
5,Mennonite Cookbook should be in EVERY kitchen,"This is a very helpful and resourceful book, that must be in every kictchen. I received this book as a gift from my mother-in-law, and have used it constantly over the years.There are excellent recipes, hints and tips. I would highly recommend this book to all those who are in the kitchen. Everyone can learn something from this book, young or old, new cook or experienced. You will not be sorry you've purchased it. I would not be without mine."
1,A must miss item,"I was given one of these for Christmas. I thought, great! I can now use a wok that will actually be hot enough to cook in (I have an electric stove, not a gas one). But boy, was I wrong. This thing does not have the heat to make anything more than about 1 serving. Want to make fried rice? Go ahead and do it in a frying pan on the stove. That will be twice as hot.The fondue pot works well however. But get serious. How often will you actually use a fondue pot? Although, now that I'm thinking about it, I might make some chocolate fondue tonight...."
5,Great DVD-Todd is a great teacher/drummer.,"This is a great DVD. Worth buying. There is a lot of great information here, such as playing ghost notes and how to be a professional. Cool tips for all."
2,PAPERMATE FAILURE,RETRACTIBLE FEATURE ON ONE OF THE THREE PENS DOES NOT WORK AND ONE OF THE OTHERS DOESN'T WRITE.
3,American version is a rip-off!,"They did it again! The american version of this great album has fewer tracks (like the Eurythmics Greatest Hits CD). Why this is common practice is unclear, but unless you live in Europe or want to pay import prizes, don't look for the title (!) track ""Glittering Prize"", ""American"", ""Speed Your Love to Me"", Mandela Day"" or the quintessential classics ""Lovesong"" and ""Ghostdancing"". Too bad we live in the States, I guess"
1,buyer beware!!,"If I could give this product NO STARS, I would have. I bought 2 1gb memory sticks from PNY on Amazon after reading the reviews. After installation, about 6 months after,my computer began to act strangely.It would shut down for no apparent reason. At first I thought it had a virus, but this was not the case. The memory sticks were bad. Not just one of them but BOTH. I have read other reviews from people buying the PNY memeory sticks (made in Taiwan) and have had the same problem. When you check the reviews on your purchases, don't just check Amazon, check out the consumer sites as well. I sure will now."
3,Jumps,"I purchased the moonshoes for my two boys. Although they absolutely love them, I was expecting a little more, especially for the price. The jump was fun for them, but the picture is a little misleading. I was under the impression that the shoes would allow my boys to jump very high ...like in the picture, however, it's more of a springy jump."
3,Indoor fun for the winter,"My son got these last Christmas when he was 8. I bought them with the idea that since we are homeschoolers (ie home a lot) in the northern US (ie inside a lot), these would be good for burning off some energy. My son is/was small for his age, so I knew that these would last him for a long time.Our neighbor has a backyard trampoline and my son is rather proficiant and quite a dare-devil on it. When we got the moon shoes, however, I warned him that these were not the same as a trampoline and that he would not be able to jump and lift his feet out from under himself (as they show in the packaging-- thus the three star rating).They are good for jumping straight up and down and the quality has been good (I haven't had any trouble putting the bands on)."
2,They broke within the first hour.,"The kids were very disappointed when the product broke within the first hour. Also, the kids kept tripping while wearing them which had me concerned for their safety."
2,Pricing is ridiculous/no good for small feet,"I can't believe how much people are asking for these things. The moon shoes rubber dry rots so fast, I can't find anyplace to by replacement bands, and they don't even mention that the average 4-7 year olds foot doesn't even fit into it.. So what, I'm 41 and I'm the only one that gets to use them??? Very frustrating. If you are going to by them, go to the company that sells them for less than $30 on Amazon, DO NOT WASTE $80 on these things!!!"
1,Might as well JUMP!,"Don't let the picture fool you, these shoes DO NOT make you jump as high as the moon. In fact, even the most highly-trained athlete wearing these shoes would only be able to jump as high as the clouds.While gravity and shoddy craftsmanship might limit your jumping potential, your imagination will allow you to leap to the stars! That's the best part about Black Moon Shoes -- it's not about how high you can or can't jump -- it's about how high you WANT to jump.So when it comes to using your imagination and developing important motor skills, Hart Enterprises' Black Moon Shoes are leaps and bounds above the competition."
4,Great Filter!,"I took this on two back packing trips now and it is awesome!! NO more hand pumping, no more wasted time. All my fellow campers loved it too--perfect for big groups at base camp."
4,Circulon Cookware Set,"I really do like these pots and pans. Foods cook evenly and the non-stick surface is working great. My only complaint is that they are a bit heavy.After having a glass lid to my last set explode in my kitchen, I am delighted to have metal lids. I am perfectly capable of using a hot pad to lift the lid and check on what I am cooking.Chris"
4,i like it,It is a great cookware but it is not truly dishwasher safe. If you want it to last longer do not put it in a dishwasher. After about 5 times in a dishwasher the color of nonstick finish started to turn gray.
5,Good Buy,"Great service! Amazon's price was half off the price the major retailer was advertising on sale! Pans are great, just as described."
4,very nice set,"so far so good with this set of cookware. only con is the opening in the handle, which is perfect for fingertip pinching.update: It is very heavy, but cooks evenly and food doesn't stick. The cookware is holding up very nicely even after daily trips through the dishwasher."
2,2 sets later,"I purchase as set of the Circulon and received the set with a damaged 8 quart pot. It had been bumped on the side during shipping and was out of round. I returned to receive a replacement with exactly the same damage. I have returned for a refund. They look nice, but I cannot vouch for the performance. The factory obviously needs to provide space between the handles and the box to prevent damage. Too bad the box did not get the same amount of engineering as the pans! Amazon was excellent in sending a return and making this process simple."
1,BEWARE G3 BUYERS!!!!,"Physically there was nothing wrong with this. However, it says it will fit the G3, but it doesn't. IF YOU BUY THE G3 DO NOT BUY THIS CASE.The best part of this experience was Amazon's return policy. What a breeze! I've never seen such a simple way to return things. Heck, they even paid the postage!"
2,not good,ka 1100 mine was defective so sent it back no fm also sw recepion was terrible sound was great. I did not order another one and I do not recommend this radio.
1,bad bad product,"This item worked for approximately 5 min. if that. It wasn't getting any power so I moved the location...still nothing. I contacted the manufacturer that asked for the model number and they would send me a new power cord, however this model does not have a detachable power cord. To return it it says I must pay $8.00 I will go to a local store and purchase another one. I am very disappointed because up until now I have been pleased with Amazon purchases."
1,Poor edge,After reading many reviews I had high expectation only to find this sharpener did not provide a very sharp edge even after trying various pressure and technique. my nephew and a friend tried it as well only to realize the same poor performance. I decided to return the sharpener which was also very difficult since Amazon doesn't have user friendly return method nor easy to find phone number. I advise use a hand stone or better brand sharpener.
1,Scratches Knives,"This machine made my blades sharp. However, it scratched my brand new knives on the side. Circular scratches. I don't recommend. I was very careful when pulling the knives through the appropriate stage. This is being returned."
4,"Great, but becarefull after use ;-)","I've lots of knives, and needed something to sharpen them. My dad would use a bench grinder, and his knives were always sharp, but took him some 'minutes' to get the job done. This thing Chef's Choice is really great, easily does the first pass by roughly making it sharp, for which is has two angles, one for regular European knives, the other one for Asian knives. And the second pass it really does the finishing touch, and you've a really sharp knife. Give it four stars, as getting a really sharp knife, you need to practice, and be patient. Yes, much better than a bench grinder ;-) And at the final step, you likely cut into the plastic around the grinder, so I'm wondering how long that will last. So still room for improvements."
4,Freaky and original; recommended,"An apocalyptic turn of the century road movie in book form, Dirty Boots is a welcome, thankfully politically incorrect work that could easily be a film. It's a tight, fast read with two likable, unique outcast characters in the leads and a rouge's gallery of disturbing maniacs who they encounter along the way. Original and a great setup for (hopefully) a followup!"
5,beautiful!,Easy to carry and great accessories for a day in the park! I LOVE my picnic basket! I can't wait for the next time that we use it!
1,RETITLE to AIX for UNIX beginners,"This book is not advanced enough to even have ""professionals"" in the title. Seriously though - weak index, limited depth of AIX Unix system. I have referenced 4 times so far regarding ""semi"" advanced subjects and found nothing useful. Not a good tool"
1,Killed a tree for what????,"Being a relative newcomer to the world for AIX I thought that this book would be an answer to a few of my question. All that it left me with is more questions unanswered and lighter in the wallet. It claims to be a ""Fast AIX answer book for the experienced UNIX pro"" but all I found it to be is a fast waste of time and money. Shame on me for buying it and shame on Bonnie for writing it. Thats my opinion and I am sticking to it....."
3,It's ok.,"I thought that I would love this series of music cd's, but I was wrong.You get one of two great songs, and the rest are no good."
3,Kind of disappointed ;-(,This product wasn't as good as I would have liked it to be. It is not the same songs as the radio plays and some were previously unheard of to me.
4,Great non-traditional Christmas Songs,"I enjoy this album every year, Sinead O'Connor is a beautiful, sad song that works for many situations and is not just a Christmas song. I would buy the CD for just that song."
5,Every Monday Morning,"Every now and then I discover a wonderful children's book that makes sense to share with my grandson, Holden. Such is the case for Every Monday Morning by Linda Hutton. Here is a delightfully captivating story with a message of giving to others that every child should hear. What I like most about Every Monday Morning is that it encourages Holden to think about doing the right thing- rather than just telling him what to do. Great book."
2,Folly by Laurie King,The first 75% of this book was slow reading and boring in most parts. The end of the book finally became interesting. I found too much detailed information in housing construction.
4,Great Deal,"These rawhides are much cheaper and thicker than your everyday pet store raw hides.We have two dogs - one 100 lb. dog and one 10 lb. dog.The only reason I gave four stars is because I wished there was more variability in size. The small dog has a hard time finishing a treat that is almost the size of her.On the flip side of that, the lab LOVES the size and thickness.This is a great deal, and when our supply starts running low, we will most definitely be ordering from them again."
4,disturbing/beautiful,"this is a really nice cd, at least if you're into trippy and somewhat disturbing music. it's the kind of stuff that would sound like noise rather than music to people only used to top 40, but after you get used to it, you see that it has a logic all its own. highly recomended."
3,Geared to novices,"Thought this might have some stimulating new ideas for a seasoned moderator like myself, but it does not. Would recommend for developing the repertoire of young professionals."
1,Beware of tribute bands!,"I made the mistake of thinking a tribute band could somehow capture the magic of an original artist-at least to some degree.This is the most slicked-down drool anyone can offer.It has all the spirit of a barbershop quartet.Its a completely safe re-creation of W.C Handy's original songs.If the Mills brothers were your thing,maybe this would work for you.If you want a package that best captures the soulful snap of the master himself,get an original package."
5,Excellent Eclectic Blues-Rock With An Urban Flavor,"Collin Mulvany's debut album synthesizes his expert acoustic skills with a delicious slide that delights and refreshes. This disc is for those who are tired of pop-guitarists, and are ready for a more rounded and meaty version of electric and rock-blues. He mixes relaxed, soulful melodies with urban backbeats and deep, heavy bass lines. Music afficianados who truly appreciate songwriting as an art will find this album well worth a listen."
3,Mediocore madness,"The ""Fighting Pharaohs"" text is still striving to compile what little information we have in the archaeological record for the military in ancient Egypt and put it into a comprehensive whole. However, I have serious doubts about the aims of this book. It tries to draw conclusions that are simply not there - who were the 'enemies of Egypt', the khepesh sword as a weapon etc. It concerns me that someone would take this book too literally. So if your interested in warrior pharaohs, I recommend this title but also get Shaw's 'Egyptain Weapons and Warfare', Healy's ""armies of the pharaohs"", and read the 'military' section in Redford's Oxford Encyclopedia of ancient Egypt - this will give a better rounded view of the material and what can be drawn from it."
1,Not worth even the low price on Amazon,"I like to read about absurdities, and I expected that this book would describe absurd Christmas inventions over the years. This book is nothing more than a collection of patents, without any editorial content at all. So you get to see the mind-numbing diagrams the 'inventors' made, along with their tedious descriptions, just as the patent office received them. Too boring to even attempt to find the humor. An editor should have distilled the jist of each invention and added a little humorous commentary. Don't waste even a few dollars on this."
3,Buy one of Asia&#65533;s real albums instead,"Then & Now contains six hits and four new tracks. The hits are brilliant but the new songs are not that good, they're a little too easy, you can feel the band members were about to get fed up.You'd be better off buying one of Asia's first three albums, especially Astra. And whatever you do, do not buy anything newer than Then & Now!"
4,Grade B-,"Not much of hits package here, 3 songs from ASIA, 2 from ALPHA, and 1 from ASTRA. Plus 4 new songs. For the hits part, alot of songs were left out, thus the B-. For the new songs, 2 rock, PRAYIN FOR A MIRACLE, DAYS LIKE THESE, Asia at it's best. The other two sound like warmed over leftovers."
2,Asia's final tracks with Wetton,"This is a compilation of old '80's hits and new material recorded by Asia in 1990. This concept is indeed unfortunate, as the new material does not pack the same power as the old. However, one new one,Days Like These especially stands out; it sounds like it could have come from the Astra sessions. Otherwise, sorry to say, the final Asia tracks with original vocalist John Wetton are well-played and nice but not among the most memorable of their career. I think I can safely say these are actually Asia's weakest. I'd advise anyone looking to buy an Asia best-of to ""Anthology"" instead. It includes definitive remakes of the best of the '80's with the best of the '90's Asia, all sung by the superior John Payne."
2,"Asia Then, Now, Whenever; Its the Same Old Song","The advantage of owning ""Asia: Then and Now"" is that it is a cheap way to obtain the four raido hits that made this second rate version of Yes popular in the early 1980s. ""Heat of the Moment,"" ""Only Time Will Tell,"" ""Don't Cry"" and ""The Smile Has Left Your Eyes."" I submit that this is all of the Asia music most sentinent adults will ever need to hear or own. Asia at least avoided... annoying tendency to stretch lame songs past the twenty minute mark. Instead, you only get five four minute bursts of lameness after the hits have passed. Why anyone would listen to ""Then and Now"" beyond track 5 is beyond me."
3,Lacks a few songs.,"Then and Now is good. It could have been better, though. While I think that what's on it is decent, I also believe that it doesn't have enough meat to it. There should have been more songs included from the previous three albums. The songs that are included are good, though. ""Sole Survivor"" and ""Here Comes the Feeling"" should have been included. Just including two songs from Alpha wasn't good enough, either. More than just one song from Astra should've been included, too. It sounds like I don't like this compilation, but that's not completely the case. I like the four new songs that they recorded for this album. All four of the songs are listenable. ""Am I in Love?"" is a really nice ballad. ""Days like These"" is really energetic, too. Then and Now leaves out a few songs, but it is still okay (just a bit incomplete). The album cover is cool, also. Worth a listen."
5,I love this,"I love this music. Comparible to the group Peter, Paul, and Mary. Gentle, lulling, yet spirited and energetic. Beautiful songs. I own their first cd, and am looking for my next one already. Listen to it at night. I own the first album. It is encouraging and uplifting. They both have forceful voices, and can quickly inspire goosebumps and warmth in the body when listening to it. This is not just for those studying scripture. This is comforting music to use when you need comfort. This is music to listen to when you need cheering up because you are having a blah day. I am sorry I cannot give a clip of this music here. I find myself singing the songs in my head as I lie down to sleep. They are truly comforting. And the voices of Patti Vaillant and Paul Dempsey are truly empowering. I am not good with describing voices so this will have to do."
5,Pocket Chart,This product has helped me a lot in the classroom. It is very durable and hangs easily.
5,This book made me love to read,"I would recommend this book to any kid wether he loves to read, absolutely hates it, or is just starting out. I hated reading until i was read this book in the third grade. I had never read anything like it and it made me want to read all the time. This book has multiple sequels, so when i finished the first one, i read all the others after it. It has adventure and mystery while also teaching good values."
5,Boxcar Children For Me!,"Have you ever wondered what it's like to live in the woods? Well, who hasn't wanted to camp-out in the woods with nothing but nature? In this wonderfully descriptive book, you'll go through experiences with Henry, Jessie, Violet, and Benny. The children are so resourceful and creative! They come up with great ideas- they even construct an ingenius swimming pool! From making meals to using the nearby brook for a boat-load of ideas, this book is a must-have for anyone! It teaches us to appreciate what we have. It also makes us wonder what we would've done in a situation like this! There isn't a word to describe this book! Its quaint, original, and ""Why didn't I think of that?"" thoughts and ideas are just one ingredient to this fabulous book! Five stars!"
5,Fantastic reading for young people!,"My 7 year old son began reading this series of books last year, The Boxcar Children #1, being the first. He loves the mysteries and finding out what happens next and enjoys telling me all about what happens to the children in each one. This first in the series of the Boxcar Children really sparked his interest in this type of reading. Kudos to Chandler-Warner for her wonderful writing!"
5,"Read it in 1947, have spent fifty years living the story.","I read Boxcar Children in a three room school house in New Preston Conn. in 1947. I was seven and my father had been killed in France in 1944. But here were children who had lost or misplaced all their parents, and yet, kept on truckin. I found that it was out of print when mychildren were growing up, but I hope my husband orders it for me for Christmas. I have spent the past fifty years losing family and yet truckin on, I still go to the dump to look for treasures, and I am very close to my two sisters. I live in Northern California now, and spend a lot of time walking through the woods. Maybe soon, I'll stumble across a boxcar, furnish it, and live happily ever after."
5,One of my all time children favorties!,"I remember reading this book as a child! I could not put it down, I must have read it a hundred times. It is really neat to see how these children make it on their own in the woods. Every parent must get this book for their child to read and when they are done pick it up yourself!"
1,what does this unit work with?,"We own four portable CD players in our household and this works with NONE of them, even though (it was) listed it as an accessory for the AIWA portable CD player, which we bought with the Koss 4.5.Why would anyone buy a car adaptor if the odds were it didn't work with their CD player? (...)"
5,one of the best rap CDz there is,All of his songs have an excellent message. T-Bone has several songs about his life and it's good to hear about the experiences from his life. He also tells people to quit playa hating and doing dirt. This is even better than his first two CDz.
3,Installing Maxtor PCI Card /w Maxtor 133 HDD,"I decided to write and tell everyone about this card. You might be wondering why I only gave the card 3 stars. Although the card installed fine with Windows 2000, I had problems installing under Windows XP. I was forced to install Windows XP using my standard ATA controller. Once in XP I found that infact there was a MAX Blast III CD that would have solved my problems in the first place had I been using those new drivers instead of the ones on my MAX Blast II CD.Summary, The card works as expected with the new drivers! Do not trust the drivers on the CD! Three stars for an above average card, but not perfect."
3,Poor quality,"I should listen to other reviews. It burns the edges and the center remains uncooked. The indicator (red /green lamps) goes on and off randomly. If u missed the green ""ready"" it will aromatically turn on ""cooking"" again and you will get black waffle. :("
3,Great product...while it lasts,"Makes great waffle, great recipies, simple to use. After 20 or so uses, it just stopped working! I'm buying another, as kids,guests, family all love it, but know it too probably won't last"
5,Always worked great,I've had this model for 5 years at a rental property I own with no trouble. It has always worked great.Bob
5,"Lord, this is your word","If you want to get more depth into of what this recovery version is, just get it and read it. How treasure it is! You will know nothing and give an unliable comments IF you doesn't read it in depth and with your spirit."
4,Cheyenne?Arapaho Education,"This book is very informative. It's a textbook, but it is a very personal life story written by a wonderful woman that dearly loved her grandmother, her family and her heritage. SKS"
4,"Love it, but a bit too big","I really like this tie, its nice quality and great for the price. Perfect for what we needed it for. It is a tad big for my 4 year old but it was the only childs tie in the color I was able to find so I will have to make it work. Overall Im very pleased, just wish a more accurate size was listed."
4,Boy's Fuschia neck tie,I bought this product because the seller had a tie in mens that was labeled to be the same color and brand and I needed matching ties for my attendents in my wedding. When I recieved the ties the mens tie was a different color than the boys so I ended up having to return them all. Not a bad product if you just need the boys ties but I wouldn't recomend if you need to order in different sizes.
1,NOT VISTA COMPATIBLE,I bought this because it distinctly stated in the description that the program was compatible with the Vista OS only to be disappointed to discover that it is not. Only Comics Creator 2 is. What a rip-off. Don't buy this if you have Vista or you're hosed.
3,Mad About Doris,"I am a mega fan of Doris Day. So, I loved watching -for the first time- 'Romance on the High Seas... It's refreshing, light hearted and very watchable.Simple story, delightful characters and a young Doris."
4,Value Investing by Janel Lowe,"I liked the book. It is good. Like any book, it adds to what other books have not said. I would recommend it."
4,Great general overview of key principles,"The book takes a step by step outlook on investing and moves along at a pace that keeps you interested. At the same time it gives enough depth so if you want to learn more, you can understand the basics."
4,A Good Read,I enjoyed this book. The premise is interesting and believeable. The adventure the heroes embark on keeps your interest. I plan on reading more from the Gears.
1,Dark Inheritance,"I have not read anything by these authors before, and I doubt I will again. Their writing is amazingly poor. Examples: ""Parnell pulled off the right earphone and planted it on the swell of his mastoid so he could rub his hot ear."" and ""Did Thrower's severed right hand have a soul? Did it search among the trunks of the mighty trees, seeking the arm that had extended it?"" and ""You carried her to term for me. Because I begged you to."" She smiled. ""Yes, well, Jimbo, I never knew how it would haunt me for the rest of my life."" But don't take my word for it, open this book to any page and you will find a similar sentence."
3,Sugary Sweet,"O.K. it's alright to call me finicky when it comes to music, because I am. So my first thoughts upon hearing the first two songs on this CD were the dreaded over-produced feeling that I first experienced. Thankfully things started to go uphill from the third song onward, giving Aaron, and us the chance to hear the splendid range, and tone of his wonderful voice. From Soul, Zydeco, Jazz, Golden Oldies, and a spine chilling duet with Linda Ronstadt this CD rocks. I think his rendition of the beautiful song; ""These Foolish Things"" is the best I've ever heard. So turn down the lights, and let the music carry you away..."
3,"A Good Book, but...","The books has a mistache when it looks only for VB Scripts programmers and forgot the pure JavaScript programmers. If you know only VB Scriptps - and use it to write your scripts - your client side scripts only run in IE, but if you use JavaScript (you can use JavaScript in server side scripts too) in client side scripts it will run on IE, Explorer, and others. I thinks a good book about ASP need to explain how to program in ASP with JavaScript."
2,"Sorry, not my cup of tea...","I was really impatient to receive this CD that I ordered months in advance as soon as it was published on the Amazon's catalogue. The main reason being that I am a big fan of Sean Costello and I own all his previous albums that I rate, without doubts (all of them!) 5 star. Unfortunately for some reason that I cannot understand this one is not a blues album, but a sort of soul-pop-rock (with a hint of blues) - radio friendly, kind of music that is just not my favourite gender. So if you are expecting, as I was, to buy something in line with his previous works, I strongly suggest you should give this CD a listening before buying. Having said that, it could be that soul - pop audience will love this album. Sean playing is still top-notch and I hope that he will come back playing the ""blues"" very soon."
1,"Cheap, nasty, overpriced rubbish","I bought this to use as a lunch box, reasoning that the different compartments would help me construct a balanced and healthy meal on a day-to-day basis. However it is useless for this purpose, since there is no way of sealing the (cheap and nasty) box over the inner tray - which is not connected to the base. At best this is a glorified dinner tray, which hardly justifies the excessive price. I'm currently using it to store modelling bits and lamenting the fact I spent good money on it. Avoid!"
1,zvue personal media player,"Zvue returned as the customer service is non responsive. Upon receiving the player I charged it over nite. The next day plugged in an already created 1gb mp3 card. Played it beautifully and the sound quality was nice... for two hours. Thats right, a fully charged battery played MP3 for 2 hours.I called customerservice who told me second level would get right back to me as a fully charged player should play from 4 to 6 hours.No call back so called customerservice again... was told there was no record of my call. This time gave me a ticket number and told me second level would call me back.... after 3 days still no call back. Now when calling customerservice get a voicemail box... and you guessed it NO CALL BACKIf you are lucky to get a player without problems and never need customer service this might be the player for you... but a brand new player out of the box has problems... the warranty is useless if they don't stand behind the product"
1,Awful waste of time,"This was a present for my 9-yr-old. From the reviews that I read, it seemed like a good replacement for the more expensive iPod Video but that is simply not true. You can only download the company's [ZVUE] videos and music, none of which are child-friendly except if your child is a half-wit...iTunes is a much easier and more varied company to buy music and videos from. I am now sorry that I will need to spend the extra $100 to replace this mess with an iPod Video; a present is a present..."
1,One of the worst decision I made to get this book.,"I bought this book for 3 reasons; author's instution, title and publisher. After the book arrives, I know I have to change my criterion to buy the book. The book is nothing more than any traditional operation management book plus basic IT that you can see in magazine or cnet.com (cnet.com may be better). No depth, no width. Just a thin book with first year college textbook. Not recommend."
3,"Good for size and prize, not an award winning iron though...","I really hate to iron and I am terrible at it (my only failing when it comes to domestic matters), so take everything I say with a grain of salt. I'm probably not the best judge of irons.That said, I didn't find this iron to be that fabulous. It was difficult to get all the creases out.But, it doesn't leak, everything functions fully, it's light in the hand and well designed.It's just as good as more expensive ($30-40) full sized irons I've used, but without the leaking and the tremendous hand weight.So I do recommend it, it's better than average, but if you really want an iron of dreams, this is not it!"
2,It's not German...,"It's not made in Germany that's for sure, it's made in China (like everything nowdays) and I was really looking for German quality."
4,good for travel,"this one does what it is supposed to do.its features:Burst of Steam,Vertical Steam,Constant Steam (Steam can only be produced when the thermostat is in the colored cotton/linen zone.)Full Range Thermostat,Folding Handle,Transparent Water Tank: holds 2.05 oz., makes filling at the tap easyTravel Pouch,dual voltage, (you need to use a coin to change it. don't forget it when you travel abroad!)weight: 1 lbs. 12 oz.I saw cheaper ones in a local store. but I'm not sure about the quality of that one."
4,Good Iron...,"I love my iron, Rowenta Irons are great for all purpose use. The measuring cup makes it easy to fill the iron with water for all the steam that you need for everyday use.It is great when traveling because it is small and light and has the travel bag with it. I love it and am going to purchase another one for home use and get rid of my other conventional iron.Rowenta irons are great and definitely worth the money."
4,One Of The Best Books I Have Read In A While,"To put it in simple terms, absolutly wonderful. This book shows truth in the events of that tragic night. It shows real research. Next to Kitty Kelly's The Royals, this is the best book that touches on the often cold humanity of the royal family. I could not put it down. Diana fans will love it!"
1,A pathetic pack of hersay and guesswork,"In short this book is laughable. If the author is to be believed then he has contacts with every possible person connected to Diana and her death. If this were fiction, it wouldn't be very good fiction, as it is, it claims to be fact, which makes it laughable in the extreme. You'd be better of spending your money on Sleeping Beauty - at least you know that's real fiction."
4,Clear guide to basic perspective,"For some reason, perspective is the boogey-man of many people learning to draw. It doesn't have to be that way. This book will help you put that sense of solidity and reality into a drawing.This book gives a clear, step by step introduction to the basics of drawing in perspective. Interior and exterior; 1-, 2-, and 3-point; they're all here. The techniques are all graphical, and require only basic ability to handle simple drafting tools.As the title says, this covers just the basics. It covers them thoroughly, so the hard-working reader should come away from it with very usable skills."
1,extremely slow shipment,"when I was ordering this book, it mentioned 5 to 7 business days. then after almost 1 and half months, I got this package. In the meaning, I tracked the shipment. it was transferred to different locations, even don't know why so simple one book needs to several transfers.I had to write two times to ask where is my book. anyway, I will not buy anything from this company."
4,You _Can_ Master The Drawbacks,"After reading other comments on this toy I decided to buy 2 of them (as a gift for friends)--fully expecting a short life span.When the first one died everything seemed to work fine but it would no longer take-off.We compared the fully-charged, used (but undamaged) Hover Copter to a brand new, first time charged Hover Copter. The used Copter propellor spun slightly slower than the brand new Copter (we held them up and compared the amount of air current).I would advise doing everything possible to avoid battery memory build-up. Fully discharge after each session (leave it on after use)! Charge it no longer than recommended right before use. Never charge any longer than recommended."
5,Best toy ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the best toy ever, it is so much fun.It goes about (50 Feet) High.Plus it only charges in 15 min. All though the charge lastes for about 5 minutes. Overall this is the best toy ever."
4,Very Good source and Explanation,"I think this book is well written, it gives you the basic idea of the network protocal, mainly how each piece is created in a packet. It even goes a little into the Network OSI model, if you dont know about networking, then I can see how this book would seem hard for some ppl. I do admit that i wasnt too happy when i didnt get the cd that the book references too, but if you really need it, you can find it with a little bit of effort, or go to [the website]. Hope this helps those who need it :^)."
3,Aerosmith Sold Out to the Man,"Aerosmith created an album called Done With Mirrors that was really good, but nobody bought it. So they brought in a bunch of writers to help write popular songs. The song ""Angel"" resulted. To sell this album they used such an awful radio friendly song that was nothing like real Aerosmitha and they also made a huge deal about how they had recovered from all of their heavy drug useage. This IS a great story but it's stupid how they used it to sell the album. Also interesting is that they still call Joe Perry and Steven Tyler the ""Toxic Twins"" in the midst of telling everyone that they were clean! Still ""Rag Doll"" is likeable and ""Dude! Looks Like A Lady"" is funny because it was written about Vince Neil of Motley Crue and is cool in Wayne's World 2."
1,It didn't work,We spent a lot of time and money on Naet and it simply didn't work.An accurate blood test showed that none of the allergies that were supposedly cleared are still there. My son still reacts.Don't waste your money
2,Language.Sex.Violance:Other? Other What?,"I truly believe that there is no other band out today that has the raw energy and talent of the Stereophonics. I have followed them from the beginings to LSV:O? Kelly has a distinct and beautiful way of writing,structure, and thought of melody that compares to that of the famed duo of Lennon & McCartney.Change is enevitable ofcourse, and some would say, the root of a successful band is diversity. However, this CD is not the Stereophonics I think of. Where are the melodies? where are the stories within the lyrics? where is the passion behind the music? The title of this CD is quite apt, with the ending of ""Other?"" because that is what I am wondering. Please give me something ""other"" than what sounds like a bad day stuck in an elevator with this playing for hours."
3,"Loud, sonic rock","I have never heard of Stereophonics until today. I bought the band's latest album after reading some decent things about it (what the heck right?). Well I was plesantly surprised, the ablum is a loud, crunchy success. Take everything you know about techno-Britpop and you basically have LANGUAGE, SEX, VIOLENCE, OTHER? Think Blur/Oasis/Radiohead (even some POP era U2), though a bit less refined. ""Dakota"" the album's single is a loud (this whole damn thing is loud) warpy-trippy Coldplay on steroids type number. For me, the best song though is ""Pedalpusher"" which should not be played while driving because it will make you speed. ""Girl"" and ""Lolita"" are two other standout tracks. The only bad thing I can say about Stereophonics is that while this is a really good album, it's nothing I don't feel like I've already heard before. Buy it for ""Dakota"" and ""Pedalpusher."" If you don't like Britpop or Radiohead skip this one."
2,Crunching. Breezyness. Some Catchiness. Other?,"They're Welsh, and listening to their music, you can tell--which makes it seem a lot more attractive than it really is. It's distant (""Devil""), and sentimental (""Rewind""), and breezy (""Dakota""), and sometimes pretty (""Lolita""), and sometimes it's almost catchy (""Brother""). So I'll like it, sure, but it's going to be hard to take seriously an album with the lyric ""Suck my banana/Suck it with cream."""
3,The Thunder is a Little Too Loud and Violent.,"This cd is fine. The only bad thing about it is that no matter how low you may turn the Volume down, the thunder is too loud and violent. You can't turn it low enough without muting it. I reccommend it to you only if you like loud and violent thunder."
2,Let itself down badly,"I was quite hopeful and enthusiastic with this book, but it is a big disapointment.Extraordinarily bad spelling and grammar throughout make it quite a jarring read.It also contradicts itself (with regards to sexual services) and makes me unsurprised that so many men ask for them. If this one mistress cannot decide whether it'll be allowed or not, how are her slaves/clients supposed to know?A big disappointment, with no really scintillating bits."
2,Too basic,"This book gave tips like make sure you get a good night's sleep, eat well, exercise, and dress nicely. It was all very useless. It also talked about the internet like it was a new tool to be used in the job search. It's 2006!!! You better already know how to use the internet. I guess maybe this is geared towards older people interviewing? I'm not sure. Anyway, this book was not useful to me at all. Instead, I would highly recommend the Monster Careers book. It has tons of practical and very useful advice from building your resume to interviewing to following up - a much more comprehensive and easy to use guide."
4,An unexpected but well-deserved comeback for a true Soul icon.,"By the time this CD was released in 1994, many felt that Barry White was well past his prime as his three previous A&M releases had not scored any major hits despite being well-received by both music critics and fans of romantic Soul. ""Practice What You Preach"", ""It's Over"", ""Baby's Home"" and the simply glorious ""Come On"" all played key roles in Mr. White's career revival and (in many ways) this CD modernized and updated his music without making it lose its soulful and romantic vibe. A classic."
5,A great book about a great road,"Having lived in a city that the Lincoln Highway has passed through for all of my 70 years, I found the book to be a delightful trip down memory lane. The numerous photographs give a wonderful feel for the time when the highway was in its prime and used by millions traveling coast to coast. The book is well laid out and organized and a treat to read, whether you want to browse for a few minutes or do an in-depth read for the couple of hours it would take you to go cover to cover."
5,A lively highway history,"Think Route 66 is America's oldest or first coast-to-coast road? Well, it gets more publicity, but Route 66 wasn't the first: the Lincoln Highway predates it by a dozen years, runs a third longer, and travels coast to coast. Greetings From The Lincoln Highway: America's First Coast-to-Coast Road provides a lively highway history, packing in the maps which depict the original highway and its changes from state to state, the color photos of local color and highway scenery, and of course the all-important history of the highway's past. From vintage posters and ads to restored old stations and services, Butko' Greetings From The Lincoln Highway follows the highway across the country and provides a very colorful, compelling story in the process."
4,didn't really use it,"very old. i wasn't expecting a book with yellow pages, and in the entire class i had the oldest edition. but that did not mean anything, because everything except the yellowishness was same."
3,Not worth the money...,"The liberation of being completely wireless is fantastic! The design is not only flawless in terms of practical use and comfort, but the unit is small and super sleek as well. Where things fall apart is the sound. Voices are distorted, there is intermittent radio static, and a persistent white noise in the background. The sound would have been acceptable for a $20 price, but at 80 bones you can be sure I'll be getting a refund on this one."
1,very bad product,"I had the original xbox communicator, but i broke it. I was given the cordless one for chrismas this year and at the beginning it worked fine, but it does not hold a charge and is cheaply made. I thought logitech would not put out such a bad peice of equipment."
1,feeling lucky?,"Initial shipping was fast, but the communicator did not work. I've been trying to get a refund for the product for a couple weeks, but customer service seems slow, and tried to send me a replacement, when I wanted a refund. So if you get a headset that works, great, but mine didn't, and it's been no fun going back and forth with customer service."
2,It's Ok,"This product works okay. The biggest problem I have with it is that you have to wait 20 minutes without drinking or eating anything before you can try a reading. Also, it doesn't seem to be too accurate. The readings have changed a lot just within minutes. Don't trust this to get you through a check point."
4,Keeping safe,I want to enjoy life.. but do not want to be over the legal limit... A gauge to help me!
5,Great book!,"I haven't even finished this book and I've already lost weight!This book really changed my perception of overeating. It doesn't tell you how to diet, it just helps you understand why you overeat and it makes sooo much sense. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is struggling with their weight. I would really love to be able to get a hold of her book ""Eating Less, Take Control of Overeating"", which I think is the full version of this book."
4,The EAIP Bible,"I should preface this review off with the fact that I have not read the entire book. I had specific areas I wanted to look into and this book was highly recommended, so I picked it up.Wow... this thing is literally a bible. It not only has the colored chapter divisions indicated on the end of the page (so you can see what chunks of pages are chapters without opening the book), but also has... not one... but TWO ribbon bookmarks. The authors were smart to put two of those babies in, because you tend to do a bit of skipping around, since a lot of the topics are related.Ultimately, I found the text to be highly legible and breakdown complicated concepts very nicely. You can read the book synopsis on Amazon if you want a review of the topics... I am merely going to endorse the fact that this book covers a great depth of material on the subject of messaging in a very clear manner. It should be on the bookshelf of every enterprise software architect.Go buy it."
4,Classic book on the subject.,Classic book on the subject. One to have in your library and ensure all your architects and senior engineers have comfort with.
3,Average Book,"The book had some interesting elements, and I liked at how quick one could get into it; however, that being said, what I disliked about the book was that it never seemed to go anywhere. The aliens were supposed to be extremely tough, yet the main hero did not seem to have to put up much of a struggle to get where he wanted to. The climax, if ever there was much of one, did not result in anything big. I like a book that doesn't drag on and on about nothing, which in this case Dickson seemed able to get to the point in a quick fashion; however, this book seemed written only with the notion that the author wanted to hurry up and get it done."
2,Wanted to Love it...,"Bought this as a Xmas present for my child and we used it a couple of times...loved the idea...cute concept, worked with just ice cubes...easy to use and loved the idea that it had the snow cone holder built right in....BUT...we kept getting little white shards of plastic in our snow cones...I cleaned the machine out twice, and tried again...still plastic shards...called the manufacturer...no response at all. I wanted to love this machine...it had all the makings of a success, and had the manufacturer responded, I might have even tried another to see if I had just gotten a lemon...but no response, thru email or phone. Now I am trying to find another one, by a different manufacturer, that won't leave me with a bad taste in my mouth...from poor customer service OR white shaved pieces of plastic."
1,Advice from actual nutritionists,"As a Registered Dietitian specializing in child and infant health, I give this book a qualified ""thumbs down"" for its erroneous information. Besides referring to foods like avocados, nut butters, eggs, cheese and tofu as ""low calorie"" (which they are not), the authors encourage parents to allow their young ones to eat whenever they want from ""nibble trays"" placed on a low fridge shelf. The recommendations are glaringly inconsistent with those of dietitians and nutritionists. See Ellyn Satter for good advice."
2,Needs Redesign,I purchased this last year for Christmas. Don't buy the 6 or 8 oz bag as it will get stuck in the popper. The motor is not strong enough to process that much pop corn. When it does start poping the lid is to light and you will loose approximatly 15 to 20 % of the kernals. Buy something else.
3,Pretty good,"I really like this game except for the fact that you can't drive the boat. All you can do is troll around. I also would have prefered the graphics to be more realistic instead of cartoony. But still, those things aside, it's pretty fun and catching lunkers is a blast. It's also a big hit with my nephew as well b/c he loves to duel me to see who can catch the most and biggest bass. If you don't mind just trolling and cartoony graphics, then big all means pick this one up at a bargin price."
2,I have a problem with this product,"Hi, i recieved this product, but is no totally chrome is Without sheen. A friend received the same product with the same Part Number and this is chrome with sheen. This was the Reason why i bought its. What can i do for change this? thank's"
3,Fun and clever,"I like cleverness and Diana is very clever, I actually asked to quote her in my own book. She captures a,world of the past, the old publishing world BC (before computer publishing) together with more intimate biography. I got cross with her passivity over money and office space, but all that adds to enjoying a book."
3,Lots of current information for a good price,"There was a older book called TRAVELS WITH ELVIS (also called ROADSIDE ELVIS) that covered the same ground. THE FIELD GUIDE... is decently priced, has original photos and maps, and is obviously very up-to-date. Overall, the book doesn't seem to have much personality -- it is literally a guide. I can't speak for any section other than the California one, but that section doesn't really offer any terrific new ""shrines"" but covers the same old information - the house where Elvis met the Beatles, Parmount, Fox, Pan Pacific, etc."
4,Awesome band,"I'm not necessarily a huge Reggae fan, but a friend who loves Reggae invited me to one of Pau Hana's performances. The band's sound is a Reggae-Pacific Island fusion. There's a ukelele in there. I was hesitant when I heard the descriptioin of the type of music, but decided to go, and had a great time. The band is awesome live; the singer John sounds really good, and the band just has this feel-good vibe and positive energy, you can't help but have a good time. This album has some fun songs, my two favorites are Party Going On, and She Was My Lady - both upbeat songs to make you want to bob your head to the music. If you like more traditional-sounding Reggae, with a bit of Pacific Island mixed in there, I think you'll enjoy this album."
5,Good,"It does its job, i mean what else can you say, its a case? I like the fact that you can lock it thats nice, prevents wandering eyes and pests"
3,Odd man out,"Being new to brewing tea, this is the first tea infuser I have ever used, so I have nothing to compare. However, if this is a good one as the other reviewers seem to think, then either I'm doing something wrong, or this is not the way to brew tea.Note that the instructions with this gadget are minimal to the point of being worthless.I tried it with Oolong, my favorite, and the brewing time is way to long to make a good cup of tea. By simply pouring the water over the tea and brewing for about 5 minutes I get a really great pot of tea. To get the same strength with this infuser I would need to brew perhaps twice as long, thus making the tea bitter.With green tea it worked somewhat better, but still, no better than simply running it through a coffee pot.I will continue to experiment with this gadget, perhaps adding more tea than would be necessary with conventional brewing. As for now, if I want a really good tea, I will simply brew it the old way."
4,A lovely little desk accessory,"Hidden away from prying eyes in my desk drawers are a couple large bags of dried mint leaves. Bags of dried leaves combined with a degree of Berkeley are highly amusing to my co-workers.Before buying an infuser, I had a teapot-shaped ceramic dish, meant to hold the teaspoon or teabag. It didn't hide tea-stains well, and never looked as nice as this on my desk. The Cuisipro's long cable never falls in like the string from a teabag, this is its best feature. When not in use, the infuser looks like a small sculpture.A few tiny particles of mint leaf ends up in my tea, I don't really mind but it's worth mentioning for the review. Neatly shredded commercial tea probably wouldn't do this, but the inexpertly-harvested leaves from my garden do."
1,Gimicky,"Bought this as a gift. I think the top and bottom components are poorly designed when it comes to securing to each other. The recipient has had nothing but trouble and after seeing her explain it to me, I agree and aren't surprised she always ends up with leaves floating in her tea."
5,The most serene concert album you'll ever hear,"With a live concert album,one expects to hear the raucous audience,crowd-surfing,beer bottle breaking chaos.Not this one.I've always been a fan of Lo'Jo,so when I saw this one I HAD TO HAVE IT.It's more subdued than Lo'Jo's studio albums.The music comes organically;there's audience interaction,but it doesn't interfere.It offers live versions of songs on studio albums,as well as a couple of other tracks.If you want to hear (and SEE) a different side of Lo'Jo,get this!"
2,It's all about him!,"I really thought the book was going to be more about the LAPD, instaed I found out that it's a book about Robert Vernon and how everybody tore him apart and why they were all wrong! Well, read it and make your own opinion, but Mr. Vernon please don't write any more books!"
5,Inexpensive,"I now own about 15 of these and they are perfect for shaping various pastries. They are cheap, so they will rust and bend if you mistreat them, but they are just right for my needs."
4,As good as they get,These forms are as good as you can get anywhere. I approve. I plan to buy more in the near future.
1,Disappointing Quality,"I was really disappointed in the quality of this item and decided to return it. It is made of the same (almost see thur) thin material of a typical witches costume. The collar won't stand up right and ties in the back like a child's costume. The white part of the collar is not as pictured. It is not as wide as shown and was frayed, not hemmed. It's made of the same thin material as the black fabric. It also fit kind of snug and I'm fairly fit at 5'11, 179lbs. The length was good for my height, but that's the only positive comment that I have to make. Wish it was better quality!"
4,Terrific Primary Source for Reformation Study,"To get a good grasp of Reformation history and theology, one must turn to the primary source material.John Calvin and Jacopo Sadoleto's debate over Reformation theology is one of the most important ecumenical discussions of the past 500 years.This short book introduces the authors, provides historical context, and contains the two letters in their entirety, as well as additional information on the differences between Roman Catholic and Protestant theology on the doctrine of justification."
2,Although It's Not What I Was Looking For . . .,It might address your needs . . . Think classical orchestra with classical choir . . . With the tempo running a tad on the slow side (actually more than just a tad) . . . It's not bad. You might enjoy the pompous nature of its classical renditions . . . I was hoping for a little more joy . . . This CD is just not what I wanted. Sigh.Ultimately the issue is that I wanted a CD to help practice the blessings with . . . And I ordered it . . . and found out there was a reason this CD was so cheap.
3,"interesting, too much detail","This is an interesting book if you like the topic. As a follower of Tim Severin, this book is not one of the best, since it has too many details on the preparations, bureaucratic procedures, etc, and not so much on the ship itself. Much less any technical details on the ship or its handling."
3,beginner,"This book is for beginners. You will not learn any hendrix songs from it. It does show a few riffs from some of his songs and the star spangled banner in E major (how jimmi played it). I guess I rate this book low because I thought it was more advanced but if you are very new to guitar this book is good. I thought this book would be like the (In Deep With Hendrix book) which is great, but it is just a beginner book."
4,"great heater, poor customer service","We bought two Soleus MS-12 heaters last year and we've been using them on a daily basis in our otherwise cold attic. Since we use them in the office, the bright orange glow is actually a plus (I often turn off the other lights when working on the computer) but it would be too bright to use at night in a bedroom.My one complaint is that on of the units came with a broken bulb and the customer service number listed in the brochure led me to an answering machine but none of my repeated calls were ever answered. I ended up just using the unit on the low setting (which is perfectly sufficient for a small room) but that's still a pretty lame approach to customer service.That being said, these heaters work extremely well, they're cheap and energy efficient, and we've had no technical problems with them in almost two years."
5,exelent song (life),"i reali love this song, and i been trying to get the CD, but it seems here in mexico i wont. that's the reason i'm here looin for it."
1,YOUR HIGHNESS,"Considering Natalie Portman was in this film I really expected quite a bit more. I am more than a little concervative in my views, but I can still enjoy a little levity and some offcolor humor. This film had nothing to redeem it. Incredibly vulgar and no values to impart at all."
2,Your Unfunnyness,I only have myself to blame for this as I was told not to buy and watch the movie. This movie is probably the biggest waste of talent ever. The crudeness doesnt help and some of the language even made me cringe. I didnt take the advise but trust me - dont bother with this movie
2,Not serious & not funny either,"This seemed like funny movie from the previews, but it was more crude than funny. It turned semi-serious about half way through which was redeeming. It seemed like it was trying to be two types of movies but came up short in both."
1,What I couldn't stop watching,"This movie was one of the worst films ever made that I couldn't stop watching. It isn't funny, well done, meaningful, or even enjoyable. Yet, it won't release its very weak but somehow invincible grip from you the whole time."
4,Unexpectedly funny,"I almost didn't rent this because of the one star review that last person posted. I'm not sure what their problem is but my girl and I both enjoyed this movie a lot. Not sure what others expect from a comedy, but its good enough for me if it makes me laugh and that's exactly what it did. If you want to see a funny movie ignore the other review and rent this."
1,Do not waste your time...,"Obviously, I did not like this movie at all. It is crass humor with no plot and... well it's just awful with no redeeming qualities."
1,"lowbrow, filth","Lowbrow, filthy piece of trash. There was absolutely nothing funny about this movie. I just want to give it less than 1 star and move on with my life."
2,r&b classics review,I was not very thrilled with this selection. There were titles listed on the dvd cover but were not included on the dvd.
3,Walk down memory lane.,Great product for your at home parties and social affairs. R and B of the ninety's.
1,Don't expect good customer care,"My very first DVD I had problems. The program recorded only the menu and trailers for an anime film. In asking for help in this matter, my response from 321 studios?...""If you have purchased the software from a retailer you are subject to their return policy. Thank You.""Yeah, nice computer generated response. I recommend spend your hard earned money somewhere else."
1,Can't get it to work !!!!,I have tried numerous times to get dvd x copy to work and have had no luck. I burned a dvd and it won't play on my dvd player. I get error messages and I have ruined about 10 dvd blanks...I wish I had bought dvd+rw's to experiment with. I emailed 321 Studios and they have not replied with any help yet. I thought this software was going to be great but I am very dis appointed at this time. I hope I can get some help from 321 and get this straight.
2,poor service - don't buy this,"This is quite reliable if the DVD you want to back up is a DVD-5 (single layer), but most DVDs nowadays are not. You have to use nero to actually write the data to your writable disc, which works OK for disc 1, but for disc 2, its almost impossible and rarely works. You get a ""compilation will not write"" message.What's worse, there is basically no live service at all. Your only option is to ask a question by posting it on the dvdxcopy website forum. What a joke. Of course, the mods there are quick to delete questions which reveal/indicate the extent to which this program fails to deliver (i.e. see above).321 studios needs to get their act in shape and fix this problem with an update immediately. However, I doubt they will do this. This program is a waste of time and [$]."
1,Research First -- It has trouble with some systems,"This program was reccommended to me as one of the best out there, by someone who knew his stuff. However, when I brought it home and installed the drivers, my computer (Sony Vaio on XP) suddenly forgot it had a DVD-RW drive. It took me a lot of time online and troubleshooting to even get my DVD drive working again, and I have yet to figure out how, if at all, I can actually get the program to work with my system.Summary:Great program, but make sure it's gonna like your system setup, and be willing to spend some time with the experts if it doesn't."
1,Divided Dinner Trays,These arrived broken and in at least 100 pieces. I was very disapointed and will not be purchasing these again. These were for my step daughter who is a special needs child. She does not like her food touching.
3,redundant and a bit boring,"i was looking for an inspirational work on such an inspirational figure...wasn't there. Quite repetitive and I'm afraid his spirituality was redundant, a bit boring and reflected asceticism and fear & trembling. HOWEVER, he did a great job with VII and responded nicely to the Holy Spirit. His best line that I know of is when asked: ""How many people work at the Vatican?"" His reply: ""Oh, about half."""
3,"Good selection, weak projection","Decent compilation of some popular highlights from the event, though little deviation from studio versions makes this purchase largely dependent on the individual tracks here. They do a nice job covering old and new territories for tourists, but for a double-live disc attempting to capture what was supposed to be a huge event, this is as cookie-cutter it gets."
5,A very helpful book for ESL student,It's the book I strongly recommand for ESL student. It helps a lot in writing essay.
1,english learner,"This book is deliveried relatively fast, but it is not useful. The book has lots of memo the former user had created. Thanks."
2,Shocked and Disappointed,I have been buying from amazon for 5 years. And I never received a CD that was so poorly packed. This seller must be 8 years old. And the CD case was broken and probably bought at The Dollat Tree. I will not ever buy from this seller again.
5,Better than good...,"Any Bryan Adams fan would appreciate having almost all his big earlier hits on one CD...the timeless guitar beat of ""Run To You"", the young love angst of ""Heaven"", and the let-it-all-hang-out nostalgia of ""Summer of 69"" are all here.The only disappointments are two tracks notable by their absence: Bryan's excellent early song ""The Best Was Yet to Come"" and the steamy summer-night song ""Thought I'd Died and Gone to Heaven"".Otherwise, a great retrospective of the Man from BC!"
2,This is why Area 51 is kept secret,"Blacksite has a great story, a very current world with of course a sci-fi twist. the graphics are not the best on the PS3, it's no Call of Duty both in graphics or gameplay, the controls work well for shooting but the squad command is a joke. Above all that the frame rate is awful, every minor load will slow or stop the game for 1-3 seconds, the audio from time to time will feel off, sometimes you'll hear an explosion from your grenade well after it already blew up. Overall this game had serious potential, i wanted to love this game, i waited since june for this release and was very disappointed.Pros: Current story with elements of the war on terrorism,The Shooting controls work well.Cons: Framerate holds you back from enjoying the game,the squad commands are not well utilized, Short campaign (6-7 hrs)"
4,A great book which deals with Ethics and philosophers.,"I read and studied this book during my third year at UCO. This was our text book for the semester. The class was called ""Contemporay Moral Problems"" dealing with philosophers and their beliefs in ethics and morals. Religion, women, and right and wrong is covered in this book. This is a great book for anyone who wants to know more on ethics and philosophers"
3,"Personal experience, not anthropology","Despite the scientific-sounding title, this is a spiritual book. There are some quotes from Native American medicine people, but for the most part this is personal experience and interpretation. Definitely worth reading if you are interested in the spiritual aspect of plant medicine."
3,Product OK,"There is slimy stuff in the water of the golf game, almost looks like pieces of an egg. Other then that, the product works fine."
5,Takes up where Bly & Bowerman leave off...,"Slaunwhite has done an excellent job of capturing the basics of starting and running a successful copywriting practice. As with other books in this genre, the writer starts at the beginning talking about the ins and outs of the business and then works through to running a copywriting business of your own. Definitely a must for anyone interested in pursuing this lucrative field and a definite ""keeper"" for your freelance writing bookshelf."
1,It is not vauleable at all!,"This book makes me down, I found nothing interest at all. Just the format and general tips that we can search as a free tip from net!Very disappointed!"
1,Junk,A waste of resources and completely inadequate for the Server+ exam; it does not cover all of the exam objectives. I am surprised and disappointed that Mike Meyers would have anything to do with this prime recycle bin material.
1,"Author should read a book on ""How to Teach""","The Server+ certification is supposed to be an advanced designation for techs whose expertise extends beyond a simple PC to the complex systems used to share resources where availability and reliability are not luxuries, but absolute neccessities. A candidate should have a solid foundation in basic PC technology. The author of a study guide for this certification should recognize this fact. Moreover, he should convey new information in a coherent, understandable format. This work fails on both these counts. Page 501, second paragraph, reads as follows....""Now is a good time to explain bytes and megabytes. Very simply, a byte is 8 bits."" Mr. Bigelow, are you kidding?"
1,Died right after warranty...,"It worked, better than any APC brand i ever tried (APCs are terrible) The internal battery died after 3 years. It can now handle a load of about 100W for about 30 seconds before it runs out of power, so the battery is done. I have tried many of these supplies and they are all terrible. This was the best because at least it worked for 3 years. I am building my own using a 1000W sine wave inverter and a deep cycle marine battery. It will last for 10 years and I will only need to change the battery when it dies. Cheaper too. You will be disappointed. Avoid"
2,This product did NOT perform as advertised but customer service did the right thing and made it right,"The battery life of this product was far below it's stated life in the product description. Customer service was 100% helpful in returning the UPS and offering a refund. I may not purchase another ""Ultra"" item but Computer Brain did the right thing for this customer."
1,Buyers Beware,I had this unit only for a month connected to a server and had one commercial loss of power and the unit died. I called Technical Support and they refused to stand by there product just because I opened it to replace the batteries. Not very happy with the ULTRA brand at all. I cannot recommend this product.
1,Went bad in under 2 years and company wouldnt warranty!,"I purchased this device on June 10th 2008, the warranty says 3 years. The UPS completely failed after just under 2 years and Ultra refuses to support it because you have to register with them within 30 days of purchase. So now I have a over priced paper weight! I will NEVER buy an ultra product again and I will deter everyone I know from buying from them in the future."
3,I'm glad Paul got away...,"It's a good premise, two guys helping a stranded alien get away. Naturally they had to throw in stereo-typical unthinking thug-like security guards and semi-illiterate Bible-belt trailer trash, though I enjoyed the girl's transformation into regular trailer trash. In the end, the ""twist"" wasn't a total surprise, but I was glad it happened that way.The main actors, I thought, played their parts well, despite what I thought was dodgy dialog. I had never heard of anyone who could drive NOT being able to drive an RV. Doesn't it still have the same controls as a car? Maybe I'm looking at this the wrong way. I guess he was just ""uncomfortable"" behind the wheel of something so large."
4,good movie,it was entertaining from the beginning to the end...provides a good laugh...them two dudes are funny too...specially the fat one ahah....i liked it
3,Paul!,"I haven't watched Paul yet, but I can't wait to. I heard good reviews from students at Purdue University in Indiana, who saw the film in a special preview that came to the school, but I don't know if I can trust the opinion of a Boilermaker. I enjoy Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (Shawn of the Dead, Hot Fuzz) so I'm sure I will like this film too. Plus who doesn't like Seth Rogen voicing an alien."
1,Could have been a good movie,"Wow, I'm glad I didn't take my kids to this movie. Way to much swearing and God bashing for me."
1,Worst Movie I've Seen This Year,"I had high hopes for this since I like Simon Pegg so much, but this was a complete waste of time. Biggest joke was about a female alien with three .... - and that joke was repeated throughout the movie. Horrible script. Rogen's character was crude and unentertaining. I can't even recommend anyone rent it. Definintely NOT in league with SpaceBalls - certainly cannot compare to Mel Brooks' dialogue. My opinion of Simon Pegg dropped a LOT after seeing this."
1,Buyers' Remorse,Not a good movie. Liberal slant and anti-creationism. Sorry to have wasted my time and money to watch this. This is not a movie for young kids.
2,Wrong Format,It was purchased and sent to the UK (it didn't work in that country) The DVD was as described andreceived in a timely manor
4,Paul the movie,Any movie with Simon Pegg or/and Nick Frost I'll buy. I wasn't disappointed at all. It was funny!Both of these actors are good at playing goofy.
1,Uninspired Bigotry,"Simon and Pegg's take on zombies was fresh and funny. This is neither. If you enjoy a retread of the most banal ""humor"" summer teen movies have done much better, and you love to bash on entire groups of people--Southerners and Christians, in this case--in a hate-filled, demeaning manner, this may seem like entertainment to you.I attended the movie with people who are not Southerners, and they felt uncomfortable at the sweeping and continual condemnation of those who are different from themselves."
1,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...],"aking a funny science fiction based movie is not easy. There have been a few good ones and many many past flops. If anyone could do it, I was sure it would be Seth Rogan. I've loved almost everything he's been in and with this current streak, I thought he couldn't lose, but with Paul, he did. The story was original, but it was so out there that it crosses the line from funny to stupid and then doesn't go far enough to get back to funny. Paul is supposed to be this humanized alien, whose raunchy and outrageous, but the truth is he was like a hyper-active 12 year old. As for Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, they are dry and confusing, nothing new there. The only thing of interest in this film is really the cameos, so a I'd like to give a big thanks to Jason Bateman, Jane Lynch, Sigourney Weaver, Blythe Danner, & Jeffery Tambor for adding something of interest to an otherwise awful movie!"
5,one of my top 10,"This is one of my all time favorites & has been for a while. The thoughtful lyrics, combined with the catchy music - combo that just can't be beat. Dropped my Walkman the other day & this was in it - have to buy a new one now."
4,Leap Pad Carrier,I like the idea of having a back pack that matches the Leap Pad. The only thing I think is missing is more slots for the small game cartridges. Very durable & easy to carry.
2,"Very nice, but there are way better options out there!","My four year old has this backpack (...)My kiddo barely uses this backpack. On her small frame (fits size 5 now), it's very akward for her to walk with it on, because the book ends up being wider than her body. This causes her to get stuck in doors and tight spaces. I usually just end up holding the thing for her, don't know about your kid but mine hates wearing backpacks for long anyway!The design is hard on their bodies because the book is so flat, and with extra books in the backpack it's very hard against the back.The backpack doesn't hold many of the books, I can fit maybe 2 in there. (...) Don't buy this, it'll just sit on the shelf!"
4,Good stuff,"I am a huge fan of techno music and a huge fan of Gillian Anderson. Put the two together how perfect is that?? On this cd there is a wide range of techno, form trance to drum & bass. If you like those mixed kind of cd's from diffrent DJ's this is the cd for you. Plus Gillian Anderson hand picked them out so you know the cd is not going to be crap!! Trust me it's a good one:)"
1,Seller Sucks!,The seller sent a broken toy. The paint on the eyes were chipped. His face & feet were filthy dirty. To make things worse it did not even work. The toy was broken! I contacted the seller through amazon's site & never got a response from either the seller or amazon! I will never order from your site again! I am stuck with a broken toy & no compensation!
2,Bought this for my twin girls for Christmas and it was a tearfest,"I bought this because I thought it would be cute and so I though they would like it too but as soon as I turned it on the girls started to cry, they were scared to death of it and had nightmares that night. Later on when I went to put it away the girls started to cry again and this time it was not even turned on."
3,A week late,"The item arrived a week later than promised. Origionally there would have been someone home when it arrived. However; since it was late and we had no way of telling when it would arrive, there was no one home. The bench was lefty out in the rain all day."
5,High Quality for price,This watch looks very slick and goes with most of my outfits. Watch is more thin than appears in pictures. High quality as you would expect from Bulova.
5,Easy repair with free prime shipping,Best investment to make an old car new again. I ordered new struts for the glass and the whole door. Back to the factory feel where I have to struggle a little to close the door rather than get hit on the head while loading / unloading cargo in my car. Accurate instructions were printed on the inside of the box and the complete repair took less than 10 minutes and a single small bladed screwdriver.
3,"A bit noisy, but its OK for the price","The product performs as stated on the ad. For a remanufactured unit, its OK...A bit noisy. The biggest plus is the price, thought..."
4,"Intriguing, very racy, (graphic) with bits of humor","This novel depicts woman of every character but the norm! It was a bit racy, almost too graphic for my taste but none-the-less it was still a good book. The characters reminded me of some real life situations that I thought were just too strange to even talk about. Rosalyn McMillan brought some of these stories to life in this fictional book. I wished the story had gone a bit further . . . maybe a sequel!!"
1,Nearly entirely void of emotion!,"Imagine a 416 page novel without emotion. Sure there's sex, but a true lack of people caring for people, which is unrealistic among African-Americans."
3,Good set but..,I like the set as it's so handy and nothing is better than fresh salt and pepper BUT.. listing it at $34.99??! Give me a break! Don't purchase until it goes on an EXTREME sale..because you can get it on Oxo.com for $20.00 anytime!!
3,Good subject for a story,It began well but I felt that it became too much the same.At the end it appeared that the story was running out of subject matter.Not as good as Hotel Babylon
2,Too much hatred,"The main character is a middle-aged loser who hates his job, his life, his colleagues, his customers... The book is filled with hatred and mockery. There are many funny stories in the book, but the way they are presented leaves an unpleasant feeling."
1,"Good job, guys :|","The Kindle edition has no diagrams, thus defeating the point of owning it. Even for free, it isn't worth the money."
5,Haitt at his BEST!,"This CD is marvelous! Having been a Haitt fan for years, I possess several of his recordings and this is my favorite. The variety and diversity of the tracks provide a full scope of his talent. It is raw and ROCKS...just the way you should experience his music. A true MUST for the Haitt afficionado!!"
4,Enjoyable,"An enjoyable romp. And I must admit, I was enchanted by Lake Bell who is not your average cookie-cutter beauty. Perhaps it is because of her that I give it an extra star, for, as movies go, this is more like a three star movie. Don't get me wrong, it is increasingly rare for newer movies to qualify for three."
3,Painful,"This is very thin fabric, don't expect to make a nice warm, comfortable quilt out of it. Not only is it thin it isn't plush and soft. And, trying to pick out a pattern is difficult. Several of the squares don't coordinate well and there aren't an even number of patches so you may have to put multiples of the same color together in the end."
2,"Says it is for 6+, not so much.","My daughter loves this blanket, I thought it would be a great gift for her to make since she loves the knot blankets so much. First of all, there is no way a six year old can knot the blanket, you are not given enough room to knot with smaller, child-like fingers, the material is not that great on two sides of each square and if you were a child you would pull to hard and rip the blanket. It took me two days, about 4 hours each day to do the blanket. Like I said, not for the age it says it is for."
2,This toy is hard for a six year.,"We purchaesed this toy for an advanced 6 yr. old. Her mother ended up having to untie and redo the knots, because they were, well,knotted incorectly. This was very frustrating for the child. Also, the toy is very boring because it is just tying knots over and over. Would not buy again."
3,"ok, but had to sew it","The girls were excited about it, but the fringe is too short to tie, so we had to sew it instead."
2,Not for a 6 year old,"I can't imagine any 6 year old spending the hours involved in tying the hundreds of knots (I estimated 1500 knots) that are required. The material is hard to knot. It seems that some of the ties are a little too short and you have to fight with them. Certain colors really stretch out when you pull them to tie them. Its a good idea, but too much work in concept for the average 6 year old. I was looking for a fair independent project for her, and I ended up doing all the work. Might be a decent project for an older child. The finished project looks nice, but its not durable and I am afraid it is going to get ruined in our house."
2,Great idea but a lot of work,"It says 6 and up but most 6 year olds are not going to want to put in all the work. There are a ton of knots to tie and my 6 year old is still learning to tie them. Even if she was good at tying knots I don't think she'd have the patience to tie all the knots. So either they should've made fewer ties or made it smaller overall. I guess we can split it and have two baby blankets, one we can save to do another time but I think they should've said 8+."
4,Knot A Quilt,"I bought 3 of these kits - one took me about 10 afternoons tofinish because it was going to my granddaughter in WA. Sinceit gets rather cold and this ended up being very light, I tooka blanket I had, cut it to size and lined the quilt. Turnedout fantastic and I know this will keep her warm!"
5,Since the last time,"Next to the Roots no hip hop ers can integrate live instuments into their music like Arrested Development. It is not as if AD or speech had stopped making music, just that they lost confidence in Americans, which had an ear towards Gangsta rap. I guess it is also a credit to Japanese sense of good music they AD Sold well in Japan. I had to order this Album online, cause most major CD stores would not stock it on their shelves..This album is well worth hearing and is very underrated. and they are clearly still inspired by the Sly & the Family Stone experience..... as well AD has inspired an entire slew of Southern style hip hop. Among the best songs on this album, check out song #4 Sao Paulo"
3,This game is in rips bra!!!,"Dude, this is the narliest game i have ever played! This game is in rips bra. I love how you can get the massive air of the waves at Pipeline. I like to rip it up with Rob Machado. He is so narly. The graphics are tight and i like how not all of the waves are exactly the same on this game."
3,Birds of Prey with David Janssen,"This would have been a ***** Movie if they had left in the original TV Soundtrack with ""3 Little Fishes"" My Guess is Royalty issues since the movie was low-budget! But, David Janssen gave an A-#1 Performance. Try to find the Original Soundtrack with ""Three Little Fishes"" if available!Charlie Neilfan"
4,Ready to explore,"This is just what I was looking for to help plan a Beaten Path backpacking trip. I have another Falcon Guide book that has several inaccuracies, so I am going to be a little skeptical until I actually try this one out. It seems to be very complete and well worth the money even if it's not perfect. The whole point of this type of book is to get out there and see for yourself what it's like, and this will help me get started."
2,A co-dependent one-hit-wonder looking for love...another Hollywood story,"Ali Macgraw spent many years looking for love and acceptance. She somehow managed to snare Steve McQueen (probably because she was a dutiful doormat), but he was no prize. She starred in ONE hit movie, that no one in THIS day and age would even THINK about watching a second time. And she loves, loves, LOVES yoga.There, I summarized the whole book for you - for free! Save your money. I bought it used at a sale, and now I want to give it away."
1,Save Your Money,"After about 3 months of light duty use on my HP LaserJet 4MP, the printouts are now unreadable. Removing and shaking the toner cartridge helps to improve the printouts slightly...but the text are not dark and crisp. Based on my experience, I do not recommend this product. Spend the extra $40 and buy an original HP toner."
1,"Terrible Release...Thankfully, a Better Version is Available","I bought the Synergy release earlier this year, so excited I was by the possibility that this would fill in one of the few blank spaces on my Fellini shelf. After 5 minutes of watching, I turned it off. For me, it was unwatchable.Thankfully, now in March 2011, RaroVideo of Italy has released a much better version of Fellini's film which is also for sale here at Amazon.If you want another opinion, check out the review at dvdbeaver.com."
2,pretty watch flawwed design,"As this watch is very nice looking there is no way to keep it on your wrist the back of the watch which is not shown in the picture is flawed. I even called them before I bought the watch to have them explain the back of it but they could not do that since they didn;t keep there stock where I was calling and they were looking at the same picture I was. There is no clasp or anything to hold the srape in place therefore allowing it to get looser throughout the day not staying on right (unlike a regular watch) , and if your not paying attention it could fall right off your wrist. I tossed all the return paperwork liking the watch but that was before I tried to wear it for a day. It is very hard to get through to timberland to try to resolve the problem as their customer service must be really busy this time of the year."
5,Eloquent and Useful for all Pagans,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this book at first, but it blew me away. I expected a book on Wicca, but the exercises and ideas, eloquently written but easily understood, can be used by all Pagans. Starhawk beautifully explains her views of deity and easily convinces you that you want to follow her path as well. As other reviewers have said, some of her views may be based upon historical uncertainty and feminist in nature, but like Paganism teaches us, sift through this and find what YOU are looking for. This is a ""must read"" for anyone interested in Wicca, Paganism, or religions in general."
3,An interesting book to help awaken your conscience,"This was an interesting book, but I have not found most of the information new or relevant."
3,trop facile a finir le jeu,j ai termine le jeu en 2 heures environ... beaucoup trop court. dommage car le jeu est bien mais cote graphique on dirais que les soldats sont en cartons en ne sont pas realistes et le mouvement est saccadé. preferable de louer ce jeu que de l acheter...
3,GOOD game,I'll admit i was excited about this game when i first played it....overall its a good but not great game....the graphics could be better and more realistic great war game but has its ups and downs training mode could be better especially if u look at your commander and he is talkin and his mouth isnt moving faces are kinda sluggish pretty good selection of weapons...needs more game modes and also it is kinda short ending is dull and the selection of guys to pick are the same i dont see the difference in them same people but i guess a diff flag...easy to get a hang of if u go through training mode better if u had someone else to play with
4,Well!,"Very interesting. Good for meal replacement. I like earthy taste, mixes best with pineapple type juices. If strong willed, much weight loss and vitamin absorption can be achieved."
4,I learned a lot but wished for more,"A very good, informative story of the Jewish Brigade which fought in the Italian theatre in 1945 then later crisscrossed Europe exacting revenge on SS troops and rescuing Jewish refugees. I only wish a little more detail was included as the book is a rather quick read. Despite that, a very good book that left me wanting to go out and read more on the founding of modern Israel and the Israeli-Arab conflicts which followed."
5,GREAT!!,"Now if only all box sets were this good! A MUST HAVE for Police fans! Not only does it have their best material but you can hear the evolution of Sting's incredible songwriting and Stewart's unbelievable drumming skills. They basically started off as punkish band ripping off reggae but the band slowly evolved into their own sound! It's a shame when they found their sound they broke up. But as you can tell by Sting's incredible songwriting on Disc 4, it was time for him to leave.It was time for him to see the Blue Turtles! Just to have the haunting tunes ""Burn For You"" and ""Once Upon A Daydream"" is worth the price of the box set alone"
5,THE POLICE RULE!,"This is a compete album of everything the police ever recorded, you can't get any better than this, I listen to it every day, if i have time. STEWERT COPELAND, STING, ANDY SUMMERS! i could scream! AHHHHHH!"
4,Typical Zig,"Better Than Good was a quick and easy read and written in typical Zig fashion. I love the stories Zig has accumulated over the years and they illustrate his points so well. Reading Zig's material seems to put me in a better mood, just by the way he portrays his positive attitude and outlook on life through his writings."
4,Opposite You duetsTT,These two beautiful voices blend together very well. Both performers have many Broadway credits and they sing a number of musical theater songs as well as some I didnt recognize. This CD is for someone who loves old-fashioned musicals with a good dose of Sondheim thrown in.
3,so so,"I'm not sure if this was just defective, but I noticed I had to take the batterty out and replace several times before the light indicator came on signalling that charging had begun. It works, however."
5,Still sounds fresh!!!,"I think the best part of this band is their rhythm section. These guys are awesome in their instruments, specially John in harps and guitars. The drummist is good too, the bass marks very well and Chad in guitars, with great solos. Also check out: ""Straight up untill morning"", with more blues and hard rock."
2,I BOUGHT THE HYPE AND THE ALBUM!!!!!,"Just ok music. Not my cup of tea, but I liked ""Run Around"" so I picked it up. Guess what, I never liked any other song on the album. Don't bother. If you want blues, get Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, or Buddy Guy, BUT this is not blues!!!!"
1,I wasn't too much for Paul Butterfield either,"I hated ""Run Around"", and ""Hook"" as they are too full of harmonica. I figured let's see what else is on here. I wasn't really all that inmpressed with this there was only two songs on here that showed any hope. ""Faliable"", and ""Look Around"". I just am very picky about my blues. I am more partial to Blues Guitar, and a Honest to Goodness Blues Shouter; this isn't even close. So my appetite for the blues is limited to Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, B.B.King, and some Robert Johnson. Harmonicas are too depressing for me, so Paul Butterfield, Bob Dylan, Stevie Wonder, etc. would have a hard time making it into my record collection, and this one definitely isn't going to get in."
5,Wishing for more,"I like their sound just not all their songs and so I bought some songs, thats what I like about this type of purchase"
1,noise,"I found a copy of this at a used bookstore and its just a bunch of electronic noise that is going to cause a headache, DONT waste your money on this. David Arnold's scores are SO MUCH better."
4,A Solid Reinforcement of Growth Investing Fundamentals,"I settled in on my couch for a closer look at this work by one of Babson's finest. By the time I stood up, I had finished it. It provides a solid reinforcement of NAIC (strategic long-term) investing principles. Brad Perry suggests a strategy of analyzing companies as business enterprises and their valuation in the stock market. Complexity breeds confusion - and often failure - in this seemingly difficult field. Perry presents a common sense outlook, shaped with healthy skepticism, that demonstrates that the factors for investment success are actually quite simple, and that investors should focus on some basic principles."
4,Good Game,Never played the first. Tried but too old school for me I guess. Duel Saga was fun. Won't say it compares to FF games but it was solid. Enemies are tough when entering new areas. Art combat is interesting. Enemy Bosses are entertaining. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys turn based RPGs. Sure there's better but there are many worst. Not a waste of time at all.
3,Just a game to pass time.,I really enjoted the first one but the first one had a better arts system and was way more challenging than this one. I originally got this game just to pass the time until wild arms 3 came out but it has gone longer than I had expected and in this game is kind of bad. there is always some stupid detour that they throw in just to have you level up more to make the game too easy. This game has lasted ten more hours than it should have. Normally a long game is good but with every dungeon you are fearing the long drawn out battles that occur too frequently. But don't get me wrong it is a fun game just with many flaws. I would wait until there are no really good rpg's out to get this one...
4,...wow...,"Oh my God! I cant really say anything negative about the saga so far. The first one (Legend of Legia) had an amazing storyline and a revolutionary battle system, making it a hard act to follow. I, personally, have spent 140 hours on the first one, uncovering all the hidden items and leveling my characters up to the max. I have not yet bought Legia 2: Duel Saga, but I have played it and I can say this:Sound = not bad, not original either howeverStoryline = Very good, although the first was much better (both are very unique)Gameplay = Fluid controls and everything, the whole package."
2,"Good read, HOWEVER","I agree with the reader from Sparta, NJ USA. The author was far too critical of pretty much everything the great Lucille Ball did after I Love Lucy. The author even had the GALL to criticize Lucille's so-called ""puffiness."" This book is for Lucy fans but diehard Lucy fans might get a wee bit angry."
4,Good reader for beginners.,"My six year old likes it, and can read most of it by himself - I have to help him with some of the longer words."
3,The first book is very cute; the rest derivative and boring,"The first book of this set is fun and exciting for children. While the setting is getting a bit dated, the idea of a group of siblings trying to survive on their own in secret in the woods in a basically safe environment plays right into the imagination of many kids. The characters scavenge plates, improvise other things they find into useful items, earn money, buy food, do their own cooking, build their own sort of plumbing, etc. Meanwhile the backstory percolates as the children try to avoid being identified, which gives their objectively mundane housekeeping activities an aura of excitement.The next two books are more of the same and without the element of danger - and for that reason are basically without merit. Once the idea of the first book has played itself out, having it repeated in various ways and contexts is just boring. I didn't bother with the last book."
4,She loves to read a chapter book independently!,"This has been one of my daughter's first chapter books that she could read independently. Even though some of the content and way the children speak is somewhat outdated, my daughter has not seemed to mind and enjoys reading them on her own."
4,"Historical musical document, not the best sound quality","The sound quality of these live renditions by the legendary British band The Police are not top notch, which is why I take off one star off of them. However, the material is all top of the line and a very nice display of the band's live performances in their early days (disc 1) and their final tour (disc 2), as well as a fairly comprehensive compilation of their music. On this end, I'd probably recommend their ""Message in a Box"", which sums up their entire production and a few B-sides and live tracks in a very nice 4-disc box with a colorful and insightful booklet."
1,did't play,I tried it in a cd player dvd player computer came up blanknow i've givin upthis is the first time this has happend
4,"Good, could have been great.","It's hard to complain when you get two cd's of live ""Police"", but I'll do it anyway. Both the performance and sound are good, but for your only live album, it should be excellent. The song choices are fine, but two cd's of two shows is too much. Unless you're a fanatic, one disc of live hits and fan favorites would be better. Actually, I usually just listen to disc 2 for that very reason. Of course if I was more of an optomist, I'd say it's two cd's, of two shows, full of all the hits and more. What else could you want in a live ""Police"" album?"
4,Great power point laser pointer at a bargain,"I love this combo RF page up/down and laser pointer for power point presentations. Feels good, works well, good price, good service."
3,simple to install and easy to use,"I did have a bit of impatience as I inserted the plug in device into the USB port and nothing worked on my ancient laptop, but once I saw I was installing new hardware, it was a snap to finish. When I put it to use it worked fine, so I say it is a good value at the price. There were some issues, however; 1) It wasn't clear how to open the pointer/clicker to change battery, I had to fuss with it for a while - instructions could have been more clear; and 2) when I left the battery in that came with the device, the next time I went to use it the battery was dead. A friend told me that I should have removed the battery if I do not intend to use it frequently."
5,classic film,"I've waited years to see this film again, and i wasn't disappointed. It has stood the test of time."
4,Not bad,"A good series, starts out goofy and funny then becomes more series the further you get. The ending isn't what I had hoped for and I feel there should have been one more episode. Overall you would be a Fool! notto buy it."
5,Gonzalez and daughter Trucking Company,"Excellent writing, use of magical realism elements, and easy read. You will not want to put it down."
4,Author's Selection,"A collection of around 300 poems from works of 1953 to 1985, selected by the poet herself.'... not a Complete Poems. It contains all the work which I still hope is worth preserving...'"
3,Far too easy even for the youngest kids.,"I bought this book counting on the ""Where's Waldo"" style and difficulty. However, it falls somewhat short. The artist and/or publisher neglected the fact that kids have a lot of time on their hands. Especially when my wife and I want a few hours of peace and quiet. I'm not sure what the author/artist was aiming for really.Sorry Nintendo, more market research would have been a plus. This book only lasts one nap, maybe two. Each session of the book gets shorter and shorter and the main appeal is the Pokémon characters. Nintendo is falling into the old rut of, ""What can we market with Pokémon characters?"" Instead of, ""What should we market with Pokémon characters?"""
3,good for the kids,"This is a good video. I was looking for a different movie.You think PBS would reissue ""Barney Live in New York City. Several people I know are looking for a DVD version. Their kids and grand kids loved it. It was only done in VHS. You can't find even the VHS version. If you do it is $200. What a joke."
2,FRUSTRATED,"At first, LOVED THE DVD but after playing the DVD twice it started ""freezing up"" and ""skipping"".... ALREADY!! I have tried it in several DVD players and it's still ""freezing up"" or ""skipping"" to different segments on the DVD. I am soooooo FRUSTRATED; I've tried cleaning the DVD with a DVD cleaner but that didn't work either. My 2 year old cries when it freezes or skips to a different segment because he loves the DVD. Oh well, I've bought other Barney DVDs and this is the only one (his favorite, of course) that skips and freezes."
3,Snug Camera Bag,"Nice little bag, but a bit of a snug fit for the Olympus C-8080 -- won't fit at all if you use a quick-release tripod mounting plate. Also, this bag is just a bit over-priced. Other those two qualms, it gets the job done and seems to be made of good materials and should last for years."
3,"Not the best Bernie book, but still worth reading","Lawrence Block is one of the finest mystery writers, bar none. In particular the Bernie Rhodenbarr mysteries are among the best in the genre. Block stumbles a bit in this installment, but still produces an entertaining story.In attempting to pay homage to Bogart and throw some romance into Bernie's life, the plot becomes strained under the weight of extraneous plotlines and characters. Relationships, characters and plotlines seem contrived in places, lacking Block's usually laser-sharp writing and story development. The resolution of the mystery is also a bit unsatsifying and feels forced.With that said, it's still an entertaining read. Bernie is as charming as ever and the dialogue is as crisp and realistic as you will find in any novel. While not the best book in the series, it's still a fun ride."
3,A decent single....,"For the Spice Girls, that is. The lead track was a very good song, and a strong single, but the Spice album went down from there.The only reason to buy this is the instumental version, if you are a huge fan. The B-side is boring, and the remix is really nothing but drums.Overall grade10/10 for the song5.10 for the extras"
5,My God!,"Riveting! I couldn't believe this DVD was so amazing! One of our dorm mates bought it because she had been boxing lately. She put it on the big screen during finals and by the end of the DVD about 15 of us guys had gathered around yelling as these women fighters go at it. Each fight gets more hardcore. By the end of the DVD there were 15 guys standing around with beers just yelling at the screen. I hope this guy comes out with another installment. The craziest part was some of the girls in the DVD were really hot but damn could they throw down. As a dude who has some fighting skill I would be hesitant to fight the Mexican grappler, the tall Brunette or that Red head at the end. You'll see what I'm talking about!Have fun and warn your neighbors about the yelling and screaming."
1,More Line and Less Wash,"less about line and more about just general watercolor, butgood place to begin in line and wash. Peter Woolley is muchbetter with this subject."
1,Not for Children,Not good for children. I thought it would be a great game for my son with time traveling. I saw my son and my daughter running around shooting and flamethrowing eachother and laughing when they killed eachother off. It really bothered me and I took it away. The graphics are pretty gross. Wait until they are teens to buy this one
3,Weekender cook set,"Not exactly what I expected, the size of the plates and cups are like childrens toy playsets."
4,Awesome Game,"This is probably the best NHL game on GameCube right now, its fun and easy to play! The only draw back is only being able to have one season going at a time, however the non stop hitting and fun with the game overcomes that one little problem! I would recommend the Hitz game over any of the other 2003 NHL games!"
5,Good Stuff!!!,"I use this product as a base for my own chile. I follow their receipt but: Brown about 1.5 Lbs of ground beef with 2 medium chopped onions and 2 or 3 cloves of fresh garlic (or more to taste) in the bottom of the chile pot. Instead of adding water, use Beef Stock. Add 2 cans of drained different color kidney beans (like Red & Black). Add 1 large can of diced tomatoes (including juices). Add 1 extra small can of tomato paste. Add Chile Powder to taste (I like mine spicy so I add 5 or 6 Tbs). Let it simmer until it thickens (could be several hours) and enjoy!!!!"
2,Runts in the 70's? Nope.,I'm not sure how a gift basket of supposedly 70's candy could include runts. Runts candy was introduced in 1982.
2,"Good Plot, Bad Thought","I loved the plot of this book!But it gave too much away,30 pages in I already knew the ending."
4,Great!,"First of all, it's impossible to have a real ""best of"" album, because ALL of Sting's work is excellent and people have their own opinions of what ""best"" is. So giving this album four stars really says a lot--it's really good.It's an excellent covering of SOME of Sting's best work for the first ten years of his solo career. I have all his albums so don't need this one, but I own it anyway because I like the selection. It sounds good and is fun to listen to. And the two ""new"" songs, ""When We Dance"" and ""This Cowboy Song,"" are both pretty great. The first is pretty and nice, the latter funny and witty--the only pop song I know of that uses the word ""existential."" Definitely worth the listen!"
5,Rennaisance man,"The music of a man with a great spirit. 10 years of a career that appeals across a broad spectrum, from teeny boppers to middle aged people seeking meaning.'When we dance' is a poetic lovesong that starts the album beautifully (at least the version I have - there appear to be a few). 'Fields of Gold' has one of the sweetest melodies you will hear on the radio. Sting's address to Pinochet in 'They dance alone' I love. Sting gets criticized for supporting the environment and human rights, if that's his biggest fault, he's doing alright!There is a great variety of music here, from a musician with more artistic soul than all of those overly earnest boy bands put together."
3,save me from rock star theologians!,"Much has been said in praise of this recording in the other reviews. I can't add to it. On the surface I enjoy most of it, particularly Fields of Gold. I was looking for a ""Best-of"" for Sting and this is really good. I wish it had ""Little Wing"", but it's a nice collection all the same. However, on the down side. Why are there so many songs that have these cracks at faith, Jesus and God? How tiring. Please spare me the rock and roll theologians who think they're asking the profound questions. His ignorance of the bible is so thorough, he ruins his own songs!"
5,Sting is a Hero!,Best Sting collection ever includes most hits like Fields of goldA must have highly recommended!
5,Great!,"I love this CD - it is so versatile whether at home alone, entertaining, traveling, etc...I am moved by it wherever and whenever I listen to it."
3,Average CD,"This is the album that led to the death of Grant's marriage to Gary Chapman. Amy met and did the duet for House of Love with Vicen Gill (a mediocre song at best, btw) and shortly thereafter she and Gary started having problems. They divorced late last year and last week she married Vince. So much for the woman who told an interviewer that she had remained a virgin before marriage because she didn't want to be able to compare Gary to other men (in the carnal sense). It was a sad day for Christain Music! I guess she has finally shed her Christian roots.This CD is notable only for her remake of the classic Joanie Mitchell song Big Yellow Taxi and the song Children of the World."
1,obvious manipulation,"This game, released only a few months before the ill-named Operation Iraqui Freedom, is an obvious manipulation of public opinion and propaganda. The fact that this game is intended for people as young as thirteen, who don't have any real knowledge of what is happening in the Middle-East is astounding and makes it apparent that it is just another attempt to reinforce the status quo of America=Good, Saddam=Bad, while the truth is and will continue to be America=Bad, Saddam=Bad. Save your money and don't buy into corporate produced, highly patriotic games which only reinforce the notion that war is a game. The use of video footage from the battle field, the jargon of ""smart bombs"" and video games such as this one are an ill-concieved, yet seemingly effective strategy to take pressure off of the real situation, one in which you can't just continue after you're shot. Wake up distracted America. The government is your enemy."
4,Not so great,I have played it only about 5 hours and it is like a PS1 game. The graphics are bad and its not as great as someothers. Don't buy this game!
2,READ THIS BEFORE BUYING THE GAME,"This game is ok. the graphics stink, but the gameplay is good. The game is really easy. The only good part about it is the multi-player. Its alot of fun. If your looking for a good military/shooter, go with SOCOM: US NAVY SEALs. the best shooter is halo, but its for Xbox. : &lt;"
2,Opportunity creates a dissapointing game.,"Conflict Desert Storm is a game that you know wasn't necessarily made to conicide with the latest conflict in Iraq. However you can tell that the effort stopped with the announcement of said confict. The game just seems unfinished, and lack of polish in gameplay doesn't cancel out the fairly good graphics. Pick up Socom: U.S. Navy Seals if you are really instrested in a good military combat game. This game promises much but doesn't deliver."
3,Don't pay Amazon's price!,"Go to Oxo.com and get any spice/grinding set..nothing for over $20..some only $15. Amazon has the clear salt and pepper grinder for over $34.00..get it on Oxo.com for $20. After checking out prices, most of Amazon's prices are much higher on these spice sets, almost double in some cases. NOT GOOD. The only good thing is possible free shipping on Amazon which you can wait for over a month and a half for items as I am right now...or pay the $4.95 on Oxo.com and get it much sooner. Your choice. :)"
5,Alpine NFL Jacket - Patriots,"Ordered the Alpine NFL NE Patriots Jacket for my son for christmas. Item arrived in plenty of time for christmas, and was exactly what I had been looking for. The fit is true to size, very good quality. Good bargain for the price. I would definitely recommend this item to anyone looking for a light weight fleece type jacket with your team logo. My son was thrilled."
1,FAIR WARNING: rent it before you buy it!!!,"Being a Blade movie fan and a PS2 geek, I was excited about purchasing this game. Unfortunatley, it fell beneath my gaming expectations. The graphics are ""cartoon"" like, the 360 degree movements start to get annoying if not dizzy, and the lack of a map will leave you directionless although their are ""glyphs"" that help occasionally to steer you in the right path but not enough of them. Those three thing that I pointed out was enough for me to wish that I had rented it before I purchased it."
2,very disappointing,"This game is extremely bad. Everything about it makes you think they probably only spent 100 dollars making this game. The graphics, compared to an early playstation2 release Onimusha:Warlords, are horrible. You cannot use your sword unless you have obtained level of power or some stupid thing which is so lame because the sword is the best weapon he has. You must use the right analog stick to do hand-to-hand combat when you run out of ammo, which makes you throw punches and kicks all over the place not knowing if you hit anybody. Why this has the same title as the movie makes me ponder since this really has nothing to do with the movie, and the movie [rocked]. I loved both movies but this is stupid. Avoid at all costs"
1,"Very thin, tight, and easily damaged","I have a condition called drop foot that causes me to get blisters on my right big toe due to my gate and late of ability to properly ""lift"" the big toe that causes my toe to rub inside my shoe. I bought these hoping they would give me some protection while walking against forming blisters that I could use for an extended period of time.These are very thin and don't provide nearly as much protection as the image would lead you to believe.They are slightly tight for a large big toe. And they tear extremely easily even if you have short toenails.Basically you get one wear out of these... so consider it a $2.50 a day ""bandaid"" for a blister that offers a small minimum amount of comfort.It's not at all reliable long term protection you could reuse.If anyone knows of a slightly larger and heavier duty silicone version of a toe cap to protect a big toe from blisters, I would be grateful as this would ease my walking pain from my medical condition."
2,They fell off !!,When i received them i was not sure if they will work but i decide to give them a try. After 5 minutes on the field (indoor soocer) i felt how they simply fell off the toe. I don't think they will work. Maybe if i tape them to my foot ????
4,helps with blisters,"I frequently get blisters on my toes and side of my feet while running so purchased both toe caps and dr. Sholl's moleskin to see if this will help.The toe caps I find are great as they are simple to use. I have used and re used this at least 15 times already I think they are still in great condition, just not as shiny or clean. It's an easy product to use to help with blisters."
2,Not meant for impact sports,"I'm sure this works for everyday use but DO NOT use these if you plan to play any high intensity sports. I wore one set for a one day volleyball tournament and a hole developed in the cap. As a result, my toe slipped all the way through the cap and it did not provide me with any protection."
3,Great Video,The video helped me out in my English Comp II class in college. It was my research essay. Scored a B!
1,jeez this game [is bad],"man i turned this game off 2 minutes after i started playing it. its just a button masher, the graphics are horrible and what is up with those [happy]cartoon characters ah man. dont get this game.i give this game negative 5 out of 5. it was terrible. i do not reccomend it."
5,Amen,"I'll add my raves about this book. I've read others about the events leading up to the civil war, and the war itself, and this is the best. I've read it twice. It's history the way I like it: analysing the issues rather than just chronicling events; pointing out the alternatives the players faced; why they chose the ones they did; and what might have happened differently (or not) had they chosen otherwise. This may sound like a dry approach; but not the way Potter does it. He tells the story dramatically. I couldn't wait to read the next chapter to see the next step in the unfolding tragedy."
2,"Large enough and looked good, but...","This looked good initially and fit the 2010 Honda Civic's large windshield. It was difficult to fold, but we'd learn. Within a week of using it, one of the metal rings broke off and put a gash on the dashboard. Fixed it myself, two days later the second one broke..."
5,great fit for 2008 Honda Fit,This product gives great coverage and keeps the car interior much cooler. It took a little practice to figure out how to fold it but I have had no problems since and can easily fit it in the door pocket. It seems very well made and was a great price.
1,Disappointed,"I hate it....they don't place right in the window because there is no way to accomodate the rearview mirror (please note, car in photo has no rearview mirror!) and they are impossible to fold up correctly...any wind and you're really in trouble."
2,not what it used to be,bought one about 5+ years back. Even with all the wear and tear the old one still stands up better. Materials are a lot cheaper... vinyl is almost see through.. and the cheap flimsy construction makes it seem like the sun shape might move out of place.I have a accord and scion tc and jumbo fits perfectly for both cars.
2,"Ok, but smaller than advertised","This shade unit is ok, but several inches smaller than the advertised dimensions. For the cost, it's nothing to write home about and not much better than other shades you can find for less at Wallmart, etc.."
1,Wrinkly aluminum foil :(,"I've had the Jumbo set for years now and they've been great.Wanted the super jumbo for the large windshield on my new 2013 Ford Escape.First of all, the super jumbo were way TOO big.There's needs to be something between Jumbo and Super Jumbo.Second, they were the shiny, crinkly, ugly kind, not the matte silver finish of the first set I owned.Got them delivered via Prime, and when I went to return them, Amazon said to go ahead and keep them and they'd refund the $$$ anyway.I was thoroughly impressed with that."
3,One broke ... the other still works,"I have a regular fold-up sun shade, and bought this set for my husband's car.With the instructions, I was able to fold the sets fairly easily, but was worried that with daily use the wire frame might collapse, and sure it did. Two days after buying this set, my husband reported that one shade's wire frame had come undone and was unusable. Now he only has one to use.Maybe the price reflects the flimsiness. In future, he wants to use only the fold-up version.I gave this 3 stars, because of the one-(still-working) shade."
3,Great and big BUT hard to fold,"They're helpful, bought them for my mom and she uses them for her two medium cars. Sometimes she even only uses one for each car since they're so big they cover well. But I don't like two things: First,they're a pain in the a$$ to fold... You just gotta be good with your hands or have some patience. Cause I can't but my sister can but I can't. Second, my ma says they should be thicker to better protect from sunlight. Other than that I'd say they're ok especially for what I paid."
3,too small for vans,"i bought these for my van thinking they would fit, i even measured with the dimensions they gave so i thought they would fit, nope, so just to let other van owners know they don't fit, i have chrysler town and country and do not want to spend 30 plus on a custom shade, but these just kinda lay on my dash i guess thats okay, i was really trying to prevent cracking. and they are not what is pictured in the picture above, they are more square looking. but for 8 bucks i really can't complain, but if you want a good fit for your van these will not do."
2,Lasted 3 months.,"Worked surprisingly well for flimsy looking silver cloth material. Really kept the black leather of my Acura MDX cool in the blazing summer sun for a while. After a couple months something happened to the metal wire that frames one of the sunshade cause it stopped folding right. One sunshade would still fold into itself so I could tuck it away, but the other sunshade became stiff or something and stopped folding well. Then that same metal wire frame started poking out of the border of the cloth material of the sunshade and started stabbing me and my husband whenever we'd go to fold it. About a month after that, the frame didn't just poke out a little, it came ALL the way out and so we had to throw it away. Sadly a couple days ago I discovered the one sad remaining sunshade has a frame poking through a little bit so I'm guessing I'm gonna get another week or two of use before that one goes kaput too. Got a total of 3 months use out of these sunshades. What a waste of money."
5,Great Shade,I have used these shades for years and they are durable flexable and work great... a basice necessity for south Texas!
3,Supersized Shades,The shades are great. Only thing is they are huge. The description said the shades would fit in a Toyota Camera. I drive a Silverado and the shades BARELY fit in the windshield they are so large.
1,Avoid This,These are made from very flimsy material. The size must match the exact measurements of your windows. Does not reflect heat well.
4,Dope For Dopes,"Wyndorf at his songwriting peak here. Gone are the albumside-long psychedelic jams, and interstellar freak-outs-- Monster Magnet are clearly headed for mass appeal with this hour+ longplayer. ""Negasonic Teenage Warhead"" is ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" with a few more hooks and a cool stoner vibe-- in other words, a bona-fide hit. These guys should be millionaires..."
5,Amen,I just wish I could have met Thomas A Dorsey and been at these events. It was also a great christmas gift.
4,Great song and score.,"I do like ""Bryan Adams"", and this is one of his better songs, but I often start this disc on track two. Whether or not this reminds you of the movie, it's just a very enjoyable 9 tracks of beautiful spanish guitar. Many of them keep with the ""Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman"" melody. If you like this cd, you might also enjoy the ""Brothers McMullen"" soundtrack. It starts with a great ""Sarah McLachlan"" song, and the rest is great traditional irish music. It's also very good."
3,Not for skilled developers,"I looked through this book at a bookstore recently (no insult to Amazon, but I really like have my hands on a book to review it properly). The text is large, and so even though the book is big, one page does not contain much info. I knew I was going to be disappointed when I opened the book halfway and there was an introduction to using paramaterized queries. I needed a book that assumed that I already knew basic SQL, .NET progrmming, and SQL Server 2000, and was already familiar with the basic Microsoft products.This was not quite it. It seems to be written for people with less hands-on experience developing reports, likely written for people who want to decide whether to use Reporting Services, and at a high-level, what RS is capable of. I needed something that could give me a quick understanding of the essentials, and then help me to start cranking out real solution."
2,Interesting but way outdated!,"I reviewed practically every book in amazon regarding this theme, I chose this one because it had the best reviews in its kind. But when I actually got it I felt dissapointed because of a couple of things:1. This is not a book, Its barely a manual!, It has the size of a printer manual, both in height, width and number of pages. When I pay more than 40 bucks plus shipping the least I expect is a serious book.2. This book was written when Netscape was still alive!, I mean at least the author could have updated it to talk about Firefox and Opera, but the examples remained.3. It's oriented for people who don't know much about computers, if you're computer savvy, it's probably best that you skip this book."
5,My daughter loves it. She uses it every night to go to sleep...,"My wife bought this CD when my daughter was a little girl. We played for my daughter every night beforegoing to sleep and my daughter found it very comforting. The CD broke after so much use years later.My daughter, now a teenager rediscovered the CD in Amazon and she asked my to buy it.I think it is money well spent. We bought the MP3s.Thanks Cindy!"
5,A Scrumdidilyumous read for the broad minded! :),I supurb read that is filled with wacky ideas and exciting interpritations that with fill your mind with thoughts to last for hours. For those who can understand the concept of having fantasy mixed with humour and excitement that opens your mind to new concepts. Indeed enjoyable and recomended by me truely.
3,Entrancing but disturbing,"I read this book as a child and loved it. However, it was hard to tell reality from fiction and I didn't know whether to believe Henry Sugar's powers really existed. In particular, ""The Swan"" is a VERY disturbing story without the usual comedy found in Roald Dahl's works. I recommend reading this yourself before sharing it with your children. I loved everything else he wrote, but this was frankly disturbing."
5,This Book Is OK.,"It is very confusing, but very cool. Even though the Pokemon don't look like what they are in the show, it is a good book."
5,Worth the price,"Forget those screen juicers like ""Juice Man"" for a few more bucks, buy this monster. It could probably juice a branch from a tree, and then take seconds for clean up. Very fast to juice, and clean up is super fast. Excellent Product!!"
1,Article stopped working a week of use,"I have very bad experience of using the article, it stopped working was left with a week of use has crashed, would not recommend."
5,Great Gift for the Spongebob Fan,"My 8 yr. old had seen this item in a mail order catalog a few months back, so we purchased one for her birthday. She's having lots of fun with it, and I like the fact that it's small and well made (just like the original black 8 ball) and isn't one of those toys that takes up the entire bedroom... like those huge stuffed spongebobs! If your child likes Spongebob... he or she will like this toy."
5,"If you like Sting, you'll love this CD!","I went the IMAX show (1995) at the Children's Museum in Indianapolis, and immediately went to the gift shop to purchase the CD. Its been my favorite CD ever since, [....]"
3,"Great music for the film, but wears thin after a while","I first heard this music from a friend in graduate school. I was already a big fan of Sting's music at the time and I really enjoyed the theme of the disc. Then I went to Europe and saw the IMAX film in Barcelona. It was in Spanish, which I understand only passably. So I was more tuned in to the amazing views and the great music and how well they seemed to intertwine. Once home, I bought the disc and listened to it regularly for a month or so. After a while, the repetition gets to me. It works fine with the film, but on it's own it's not quite there. Sting is not on all of the tracks either, so if you're looking for the real thing, go get 'Nothing Like the Sun' or 'Soul Cages'."
5,Ready to daydream?,"I bought this on impulse in a museum giftshop and have never regretted it. I am an art teacher - if you are an artist and need music to work to, this is some of the most enjoyable music I have ever bought. Even the kids enjoy it! ""Fragile"" is the only song I skip - I usually go straight to #2. But all of the songs are woven together in a tapestry of wonderful music, so don't skip around. Some may be based on the same songs, but are done differently. Many are instrumentals. We play it while driving - we go to the ocean. I didn't realize how many of Sting's songs had to do with the ocean until I listened to this. Some may say that ""Love is the Seventh Wave"" doesn't belong, but I disagree. It wakes you up if you are too relaxed, and it has a good beat. Very tropical. Buy it!"
5,"""This CD will give you goosebumps ""","I saw this movie at The Air & Space Museum IMAX in D.C. and it trully moved me. The music by STING was magical and the song ""Fragile"" written about the death of his father helped me come to terms with my own father's death. If you SCUBA Dive you will love this disk. See the movie if you can."
3,It's just ok...,"This is a great idea, but it's not a great toothbrush. The Toothpaste container works really well. The only thing I don't like is that it is a really small tooth brush. I find it difficult to brush all of my teeth. Item also broke in half while I was brushing my teeth (I only got to use it 3 times!)."
4,Pretty good,I was surprised with this game. I actually enjoyed it better then Dead to Rights. Some parts freaked me out when the crab things jumped out at you and some of the levels you just have to run to get to a door to get some ammo or health. Overall I enjoyed this game very much.
3,Pretty Good,"Okay, so I buy this game, because I really like the movie. Don't buy this game if you don't like the movie. But even if you do like the movie, there a couple things about this game that'll probably dissapoint you. Like the blood test thing. The game gives you these blood testing syringes to prove if your team mates are the Thing or not. But there are points in the game where certain members of the team become Things no matter what, even if you tested him within a couple seconds before he morphed out and had it come up negative. I was really excited about the whole trust/fear levels aspect of the game, which the game advertises in all it's commercials and stuff. But as it turns out, the ""who's the thing?"" aspect of the game is only about ten percent of the game. The rest is running around finding keys and shooting the random Things that pop out at you. It's got great graphics, and does do some justice to the movie, but it seems like they rushed this one and didn't smooth the edges."
4,Reviews by Nan Kilar and Bobby Miller,"A young foreign student is accosted at her front door and nearly killed. The skeletal remains of a young woman are found in the basement of a building that was once the home of Edgar Allen Poe; she appears to have buried alive in an upright position about 25 years ago. A young woman with a murky past is murdered. Is the Silk Stocking Rapist back in action in NYC? A man is found dead at the bottom of a waterfall--in a manner described in one of Poe's works. Another man is shot. How are all these misdeeds connected? Who's read too much Edgar Allan Poe and takes him literally? Why?SVU detective Mercer Wallace, homicide detective Mike Chapman, and assistant DA Alexandra Cooper team up again to solve these seemingly unrelated crimes. Alex gets in a bind; Mike has a life-changing event; Alex gets in a bigger bind. The story moves right along and keeps you wondering who the Silk Stocking Rapist is and who thinks he's Poe."
5,Fantastic Collection,This is by far the best collection of board and brain games I have ever bought. Chess alone is surely the most complex and strongest version compared to all other mobile chess games but you get 7 other nice games in the package. Especially Mahjongg graphics are great and the visuals her and in all other games appear very sharp. The face creator-faces even get animated!Really impressive an fun -- you can't get wrong with this one!
3,Marching Back in Time,"In the praise for this book (on the back cover) it makes this book sound like a ""crime story"". To me it was more fantasy...sort of trying to see if history will repeat itself.The first part of the book is somewhat gripping...a man down on his luck, having his life unravel before your eyes. Yes, Roy Hill's life slipped out of control, but to then have him reborn as a Confederate War Hero was a bit of a stretch.I enjoyed reading the parts of the book dealing with Civil War Reenactments. Up until the end of the book, some of it was believable. The last few chapters were pretty bad. I think most people are annoyed at this book for unravelling in the same way the main character did.I expected more. I hate books that wrap everything up neatly on the last page...that just isn't real life."
2,Buy the single...,"If you loved ""Counting Blue Cars"" and are expecting more modern quirky intelligent rock, save some money and buy the single. The remainder of the disc doesn't measure up to the level set by their great radio hit."
5,Works great for training,This treat pouch works well for us. I like that it has an easily adjustable belt so it expands to fit over jackets in the winter. I also like that it snaps closed so the treats don't fall out of the pouch when you're leaning over to praise your dog!
1,not as advertised,bag is stiff fabric -- hinge is difficult to open -- id compartment is too small to hold anything but an id card -- front pocket is virtually useless for poop bags -- treat portion is deep and would hold other items but they obstruct access to the treats. Designer may be a great trainer but designer not at all! Will try to wash it to soften up but it probably will be relegated to the several useless items I have wasted $$ on.Outward Hound treat bag is great except mesh tears when attacked by puppy teeth -- wish they made one w/ pockets.
2,"Great design, poor construction","See the reviews under the green bag. After three months of use once a day, one of the hinge pins came out so the bag could not shut tight, its main design feature. I found the pin and replaced it and two weeks later the hinge, itself, broke making the closing feature inoperable. The other reviewer at the green bag site had two bags that had their hinges break."
5,BOATER SHOE WALKS DRY LAND !!,"I purchased these because they looked low-profile to fit on my feet inside my playboat...and they do (great), but they also rock just kickin' around the yard, town, playing in puddles w/ my kids...great Keen shoe.Super comfortable, and so lightweight you can barely feel them. I want some more colors."
5,great water exercise shoe,"I ordered this for my mom who had a hip replacement and was restarting aqua aerobics. This shoe allowed her to don and doff independently without bending past her post surgical restrictions. As a healthcare professional I would recommend the keen roatan shoe for anyone who has had a total hip replacement, or trouble reaching their feet and needs a water type shoe. I plan to order another pair to have for summer purposes."
1,Don't quit your day job!,"Joe, you are one great guitar player. But Steve Tyler out-sings you and Brad Whitford out-plays you. This sad CD proves that to the world. If you like having a recording contract you better never quit Aerosmith...again."
3,The music is good but could have stretched the chronology further,"The music on this compilation is nice, but the set has one or two drawbacks. The first is that ""All Too Soon"" is not heard but is instead replaced by ""Dusk"", also recorded by the Duke in 1940. The other is that they could have included some of the recordings Webster made during the early 40s, when he was making the rounds on New York's fabled 52nd Street."
5,TRIED AND TESTED,"THE JUDGE WONT BUDGE. If you are a fan of trance then get this CD, this is the best CD i have ever listened to most of the tracks are from his recent ""Sexy Saturday"" or ""Fortnightly Friday Night Shindig"" shows on BBC Radio 1. Most of the tracks on this album have been ""Tried and Tested"" or have been ""Saturday Warmup Webchart Winners"" by the Judge and his fans so you know that the material is absolutely stormingly good. After listening to these CDs you will understand why THE JUDGE WONT BUDGE from his routine of constant mixes of Trance,Dance, and Progressive styles that bring the crowd's to their feet and dance.If you like Trance and or the Judge this CD is a must have for any fan of Dance music."
4,still going after all these years,"peter and the test tube babies are just as stupid and obnoxious as they've always been and for punk rock fans that's a definite plus. continuing in the vein of the classic-era ""banned from the pubs""-style nastiness like they havent missed a beat they offer the world ""supermodels."" from the title track (an indictment of glamour girls) to the pro-alcoholic ""giving up drinking"" its an album chock full of booze and guitar-fueled fury that shows that the boys haven't lost their touch. in a modern era of poseurs peter and the test tube babies show us the correct way to rip the house down."
2,Not Very Useful,"Normally I love magic 8 balls. However this one is not very enlightening because the answers are not variants of yes or no. For example is ""Mmm... Something"" a positive or negative response?"
2,Throwing dreams away!,I believe that this book is trying to persuade you to throw your dreams away. Because if I wanted a guy I would be determined not just to settle for somthing less. And if I had kids I wouldn't want them to be persuaded by it.Im very determind to get what I want.
3,Great drawings,I like the picture when Fanny stitched the flaps shut.I like the part when the twins put their socks in the toaster and burn the house down.I like the picture better than the illustrations in Little Red Riding Hood By LISA CAMPBELL ERNST.
5,Good price and quality,Needed a longer tie out to attach to my existing dog line so my dog would have more freedom to run so I purchase this and was happy I did. This does the job and is not too heavy for my 7.5 pound chihuahua. Would work for larger dogs as well.
3,A scientist's approach to sourdough,"Ed Wood the pathologist makes sourdough cultures for bread baking accessible to the novice. He's spent his life studying these kinds of organisms and has applied his science in travels around the world, obtaining many strains of wild yeast cultures for study in bread baking. He's even created a company to sell these to aficionados who want to experiment with different cultures. Though his approach to bread baking is more technical than artistic, his book is a welcome addition to the library for its sourdough biology as well as history - he was involved in a National Geographic article tracing wild yeast bread culture back to the ancient Egyptians."
3,Split and just looks 'cheap',"I like the look of this bed in the pic, but after it arrived, I regretted buying it. So much so I've not even put it together yet. I'm sure I will, it's for my son, but I'm not looking forward to it. I can tell from the logs, it's not what we were looking for. This is the kind of thing you learn with experience ordering online. If I order a wood log bed online again, I'm sure I will be more particular."
4,Nice bed for the price,"This was a great weekend project. I took the time to apply 3 coats of Benjamin Moore clear finish and it made the bed look really nice. Assembly was easy, but I do recomend using a rubber mallet vs. the hammer and wood block, as I was really able to hit pieces into place better with the mallet. My only issue is that there is no real support for the frame between the headboard and footboard, causing my to creak really loud when I first sit on it. I plan on fixing this with a few strategically placed 4x4 blocks cut to give more support to the siderails."
2,Not Happy,I didn't know it would come in so many pieces. Difficult to put together and lots of big splits in the wood. Pretty bed when its finally put together.
5,The Hawaii Diet works!,"About 2 months ago, I encouraged my dad to try the Hawaii Diet. He is overweight, diabetic, and often suffers from swollen feet/ankles because of his high-salt intake. I cooked the meals for him and within the first week of the diet, he was able to reduce his insulin and the swelling in his feet went down. Before he started the diet, he was taking 50 units of insulin a day. Now he uses only 15 units/day. And soon he will no longer have a need for it because his blood sugar levels are becoming normal. He has also lost over 20 lbs. He probably could have lost even more, but its hard to make a drastic change of diet, so he sometimes goes off of the diet a little. My dad and I both love the taste of the foods in the cookbook. The hardest part is getting used to eating meals without meat. If you live in Hawaii, where all the ingredients are easily accesible, you should give it a try! You will definetly see results quickly."
1,I would not buy another on of these!!,"Who ever designed this product should go back to the drawing board and start over. This product is very hard to use and it's dangerous ,"
1,Cheap and flimsy,"The first bagel I put in there and was ready to slice it in half, the plastic cracked down the side. Not stable at all and I can slice better without the darn thing. It is not worth the $10 at all. Total waste of money."
2,What a disappointment!,"The bagel holder was too big for my bagels, spread open as I was trying to cut the bagel, seemed flimsy and was just not what I expected. But, for 99 cents, it wasn't worth returning it. Plus, the shipping packaging was so poor, the bagel holder was cracked when I received it. NOT HAPPY!"
3,Bagel holder,It works well except it is pretty flimsey. I am using them for stocking stuffers. I have had one for years and it is a lot more sturdy. I guess that's what is going on these days.Bill Merten
4,Culinary skills at sea,"The previous reviews all rate and describe the story accurately - an excellent tale of survival at sea. To add to this now:On return, the survivors were doubted because of their apparent good health. Perhaps this is why the book focuses so much on food - they had a good cook with them and learned to dine relatively well. The story is from the cook's viewpoint too. If you have some culinary leanings, you may get more from the book than you expect.New Zealander's will also identify with aspects of the story - Picton, Cook Strait, Great Barrier etc."
3,not quite,"ok but not a home run. if you are really into rhodies this book is passable, howver, it is in no way a page turner."
3,.At least they were original.,"Styx is a band that you can use as an example of the excess of the music of the 1970's. Overblown vocals, bombastic organ and synths fighting against a more down to earth rock sound, this band is easily made the object of ridicule. But they still made some memorable songs, from the rocking of ""Miss America"" and ""Too Much Time On My Hands"" to soaring ballads (""Lady"" ""Babe"") Styx did have some talent and a way to capture your attention. The Grand Illusion is probably their only recording that stands up on its own, so the greatest hits packages are probably the way to go."
1,"Corprotate sludge, pure and simple","The musicianship is dull and sloppy. The singing suggests all the charm of scraping a fork across a chalkboard. What more can one expect from a third rate version of Yes? A third rate version of Yes, now this is where things get particularly scary since Yes, in an of themselves were pretty much a third rate band who too had a lead vocalist that suggested a pig straining to give birth to a rhinoceros. This is grizzly stuff - not for the faint of heart. Capitalism can be a scary thing, and the record industry's pushing of atrocious music like this on the masses 20 years ago is proof positive."
2,I've had enough of Styx,"They seem to be the only band I see on VH1 classic now. I love me some classic, but it's time for Styx to go the route of Toni Basil and just go into choreography. I liked the behind the music because they really had some good, solid conflict. I keep hearing their songs everywhere and they are kind of wimpy. I love Mr. Roboto because I too, have dealt with the inner workings of a japanese robot society. It's not something you share with the group and I'm someone who works and plays well with others. I don't have a problem personally with styx because I admire the guts it took to wear some of the satin outfits they did. If I programmed VH1 classic, it would be Toto, toto and a side of more toto. Can you get enough of ""Africa"" or ""Roseanna""? It's like a dang chinese buffet to me in that I know I don't ""need"" more General Tsao, but darned if I don't pile another load on my plate. Styx is more like greek food, it's not bad, but you certainly can't eat it everyday without pooping."
5,Styx,"I love this cd. Thanks a lot. All are melodious; yet, fortunately, I got more great songs than I 1st figured."
4,Wait a few years,"I think waiting a few years might have made this a little better. A couple of tracks on ""Brave New World"" could have made a better appeal for the younger fans. But, this was what really introduced me to the world of Styx."
1,HONK HONK GRIND THUD,"There, I just saved you over half an hour, you can thank me later. If you want to hear a real saxophone master, listen to Kenny G."
2,"Nice model, but very disappointed with Toys R Us!!!!","BEWARE OF CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!I bought this model several months in advance of giving to my son. We opened the package to find one of the tracks was broken, appears to be dry rot. Because this is the last item to install, we put the remainder together and had a good time working together.ToysRUs.com won't do anything because the item was purchased more than 30 days ago. Was given ToysRUs 800#. Called them, but they won't do anything. Suggested that the model be placed in the original packaging and take to the store with a receipt. Was advised that they 'might' exchange or refund the item.Took model to the store, they refuse to assist. It was not purchased from brick & mortar store, was purchased more than 30 days ago.Now I have a very disappointed 6yr old boy with a broken model, and no one at Toys R Us will do anything to assist."
4,Pure and Simple,"I've used the Katadyn Micropur tablets on two recent backpacking trips in conjunction with the Katadyn Pocket Water Filter. As a physician I am well aware of the ""inconveniences"" of drinking contaminated water so I am am doubly compulsive, both filtering and treating all the water we drink on our trips. The Micropur tablets are great. I know that this treatment will take of any microorganisms, particularly viruses, that might get through the filter. The water initially is slightly yellow after treating with the tablets but this is pretty much gone by morning. The best thing about these tablets is that the water tastes very good with virtually no after taste. It's really quite remarkable. The downsides are that it takes 4 hours to treat the water (but better safe than sorry) and they are very expensive (but not as expensive as a hospitalization). You need one tablet per liter of water so bring a lot if you are planning a long trip and/or get very thirsty."
4,"excellent, but...",excellent sharpener. bought for my dad who has arthritis in his hands and he can use easily. It is a drag to empty as the plastic reservoir for shavings does not slide in and out without A LOT of effort.
2,Dead in the Classroom,"I started the school year with an X-acto heavy duty NEW pencil sharpener and it lasted until November. I was gone for a week and when I came back it had died. So I went online and found this Stanley Bostitch Super Pro. Once it arrived I had to stick a note on it that it was for adult use only as I couldn't afford another one. Well, it is March 1st and the thing is DEAD! I can't believe that I spent over $63.00 for a pencil sharpener that arrived December 3rd and died March 1st. That's about $20 a month. I could have bought lots of sharp pencils for half that amount. Now I am done with the Stanley and he is retiring to the round garbage can in the sky. The search will continue...LB"
2,Faculty Asst.,"This sharpener is a HUGE disappointment! We are currenty on our 4th one in 3 school years. Thank God for the warranty! They are cheaply made with soft plastic gears whose teeth bend over when they meet resistance. Our 4th one (which we replaced in Nov.) is now making a squealing noise when you try to sharpen a new pencil. We too have had the same problems of sharpening on one side, that others have mentioned. Now the company (Bostitch) has sold the warrenty job to another company so it's even harder to send them back. It is a 2 month turnaround when getting a replacement. I'm currently researching a better sharpener."
3,Very intense workout,"Instructor: Michelle Dozois gives you an intense workout, alot of exercise movements, but little instruction.This DVD is meant for more intermediate/advanced users."
5,What they can do with a little clay!,"These are such amazing little films! They're completely suitable for any age. Adults will get a different kick out of them, but the ridiculous situations will amuse children too. (I've developed a taste for trying different cheeses since I saw ""Big Day Out"".)"
5,One of the best shows you will ever see!,i just love these little films and they really are an asset to any DVD collection you will laugh every time you see this movie just because the film is so great.It got great directing and amazing animations. You will want to watch this over and over.
5,Great fun for everyone,"How can you not love Wallace and Gromit? My 9-year old and I simply roar at the silly exploits of this very, very Englishman and his oh-so savvy dog-friend. (The dog being the obvious intellectual superior of the two.) This is the kind of ""G"" rated humor that's fun (and sophistocated enough) for all viewers. Next time you run out of ideas on what to buy that the whole family can enjoy (sans violence and profanity), pick up Wallace and Gromit. You can watch them again and again."
4,Amazing short films,"The Wallace & Gromit shorts are marvels of clay animation with wonderfully silly plots. I wasn't aware that the original versions had been tampered with until reading some of the other reviews on this page. Such actions always bother me--I'd much prefer to see the film the way the creator intended it. Nevertheless, there is still plenty to enjoy here. The cheerful lunacy of Nick Park's world shines through. The highlight is ""A Close Shave."""
4,music for every season,"This album is my summer album, and yet I find it in my stereo in Spring. I never get tired of ""Glow."""
1,Worst book ever,"Had to buy this book for a school English Class, comparative Literature. Honestly, it was the most confusing, dull piece of worthless literature that I have ever read. I would highly recommend that nobody buys this worthless piece of garbage, for it will make you want your money back and can't believe that this is even considered literature."
3,REGULAR,THE SIZE NOT IS RIGHT IS MORE BIG THAT NORMAL BEAUTY DESIGN BUT IS MORE BIG SIZE ISNT REAL NOT RIGHT
4,"Two absolutely great songs, one fine album","One of a growing number of fine Canadian female singer-songwriters, Arden has here put together a collection of songs which uplift and move. The stand-out tracks ""Insensitive"" & ""Unloved"" are two of the finest heart-broken lover songs of recent years.Other fine tracks include ""Gasoline"" and the delicately-powerful ""Demolition Love"". What really stands out is Arden herself - key-word is restraint - when she sings you get the impression that she has such a wealth of emotion and power in reserve - and this adds to the album, giving it a mature, hard-working feel. The rest of the album is not as stunning, it has some great touches - I like this album a lot.This album sits well alongside Marc Cohn & Randy Newman in my collection, and if you like either of those two guys you'll like this too."
2,"OK, the 50s was the best decade for TV but not due to this","Ever notice how Gale Storm inhales sharply before saying anything? I picked up on this when the series was being shown first run. (I am a real antique.) Lucy in Peanuts once asked Linus if he was ever aware of his tongue. After two wordless panels he says ""AAAARRRRRGGGGGGHHHH"" or something to that effect and runs off. It is sort of like that with Gale's one way hyper-ventilation. Once aware of it, you can never listen to her talk again without being driven to distraction.Having established that, where the hell is Topper (the series) in which we learn that Alexander Waverly was a banker before becomming head of U.N.C.L.E.? Also, is anybody else cognizant of the fact that Stephen Sondheim wrote some of Topper's scripts? And where is The Man from U.N.C.L.E.??? Being a DVD lover leads to endless frustration surrounding little nuggets of milk chocolate."
3,Tokyopop just doesn't get it,"Not to be a nitpicker, but compared to the first US release by ADV, this cover is UGLY. The creator doesn't just slap some random font for the sake of font. She thought through to use the font that reflects the series the most. And not too surprisingly (as evidenced by Aqua), Tokyopop just goes on and mangle perfectly tasteful cover art by replacing the title fonts with something done by whom has absolutely no idea about the series itself. Well done, I guess this hideous thing is what we will be seeing for the next 10+ volumes. That, and cheap-changing on color pages that no longer exists in US release. Very disappointing."
2,Not very fun,"This firefighter play set is misleading. No piece actually functions. The megaphone does not amplify a voice, the phone doesn't make any sounds, and the poor construction of the flashlight makes it difficult to operate. The whistle does work, but is made of a cheap plastic. The only item in the set that my son did like was the oxygen mask, but it does not fit well at all and smashes against his face. I will be returning this item."
2,Don't Bother,"I am implementing Oracle IAS 1.0.2.2 with Oracle Portal 3.0.9, which is pretty much the latest version of it to date (08/30/01).I'm sure this book was fine for an older version, but there have been enough changes to make this pretty useless. The product is just moving too fast. I can't even imagine the other title supposedly coming out in September will be able to keep up, because there are still issues with security settings in Portal Export/Import that need to be addressed as well as Reports Server integration."
4,Great book for 1st time 9i AS Portal User,"This book provided a very simple approach to understanding 9i AS architect. Oracle official documentation/install guide is very confusing, caused me several sleepless night figuring out 9i AS Portal issues. This book provided the simple and easy approach with the live example as you move along the chapters. I bought four other books from Oracle Press on the same subject matter and I rate them at 1.5 star. This is a must book for the first timer or a good reference for later use.Syed"
5,Good portable bike tool,"I carry this with me when riding and it does the trick to tighten anything that comes loose or to make any adjustments on the road. The unit is a bit heavy, but it's solid metal and I would worry if it wasn't."
4,Great songs but there are some missing!,"I loved this CD the music is fab, but please can someone tell me the song where Mark puts his CD on at the start it goes:Nothing left to sing about this time its over now the word is out so hit the ....Please helpI loved the rest thought Rexy your so sexy!!"
2,Damn The Man,"What a huge, bitter disappointment this CD was. I bought it because the movie was great and the soundtrack killer! However, when I brought it home, I found I did not know so many of the songs. Many of the 'good' songs played in the movie are incredible and they are left out on the soundtrack CD. Those songs include, the amazing 'Video Killed Radio Star', the song when Warren comes in shotting up the place, when Cory is preparing Rex's lunch. Not to mention Amore, Amore, Rex Manning's song, itself.Gin Blossoms, Edwyn Collins and The Martinis are included which were good songs. The first two names are the only well-known names on the disc. The songs included were good but, it seems that the songs that were draw more buyers were forgotten. I would also have preferred to hear Rene Zwellenger sing, 'Sugar High'. Oh yeah, and where is Gore, Marc's favourite band????It is a good CD but, I would buy it second hand."
3,I love the movie but the soundtrack's not that great,The movie was awesome with a lot of great songs but so many are missing! Keep in mind thought that if they were to put on all of the songs there would be well over 45 songs..
4,Sugarhigh was more intense in the movie!,"The soundtrack is great. I only wish it included ""Video Killed The Radio Star"" and the last track of the movie; Sugarhigh.Yes, Sugarhigh is on the CD performed by Coyote Shivers and it sounds great. I just thought the way it was performed in the movie was more intense...it had an edge the studio version does not achieve."
2,"Sweet Movie, Sour CD",This movie was so amazing and you would think that the CD would be just as good. There are a few good songs on the Soundtrack but the best ones are missing. The song they all sing in the morning is missing as well as others. I would say save your money until they come out with Empire Records 2 (the better mix) I know what I am talking about because I own the Soundtrack and I am unimpressed by it. But you don't have to take my word for it.
3,Thank you,"Just a quick thank you to all the people who put up stuff about the missing tracks from the film, particularly Ally from Australia, : wackyjacci (see more about me) from FL United States, A music fan from wellington,fl and A music fan from EnglandI am making a CD for a friend of mine (who is a BIG fan of the film) and it was a godsend. Thanks, together people CAN really achieve something.Damn the man"
3,Not the peak experience of Leahy's first,"I loved Leahy's first CD. I played ""Call to Dance"" over and over. And I waited eagerly for their next CD.But I was disappointed. The instrumentals and fiddling were as dynamic as ever. The vocals were good. But since the cover showed the Leahys stepdancing, I thought there would be more of it on the CD. And I was disappointed--no, irritated--by the number of Christian message songs. That's not what I bought the CD for. If I wanted to listen to Christian witnessing, I'd buy a religious CD.This is not Leahy's best. I hope for their third CD they'll go back to what made them a success on the first."
