4,"Worth The Money, But Not Tha Greatest","I listened to all the songs and some are quality but others you think ""What's This?""I think Nas would of been better with producing a single album because there is definately 14 - 17 songs which are very good.The first cd is better than the 2nd with sound tunes like American Way, These Are Our Heroes, Just A Moment and You Know My Style.Sekou Story and Live Now start off really well and in both of them Scarlett comes in and the beat changes aswell as the lyricist. This spoils two promising songs.The 2nd cd has some good tunes like Suicide Bounce, Virgo, Bridging Tha Gap and War. Some songs I think are just to fill up the numbers like U.B.R, Getting Married and Remember The Times which has an intro thats counted as a song, with the song being below average.It's an album worth getting as out of the 26 songs theres about 18 worth listening to."
2,Not really for English speakers.,"Although its great to have pictures and words together, especially for those of us who learn faster with visual aids, this book is difficult to use for native English speakers. Why? Because accent marks are not provided, nor declensions, nor the two dots over the ""e"" that distinguish between the letters ""yo"" and ""ye."" In other words, in order to benefit from this dictionary, an English speaker has to look up every word in a separate dictionary to find out all the above information when learning the words. Otherwise, what is learned will be only part of what is needed. So, since English is my native language, I give this book 2 stars. It would be great to find a book like this one meant for learners of Russian."
1,STAY AWAY!,"Like a previous reviewer wrote, if you like in a place where there is snow...these will bind and rust to your valve stems. Understand, you can add anti-seize or may be even a silicone tape to the threads before you put them on, but those will not be 100% affective in all cases. I did and was able to get 3 off with some work, but one totally broke off the stem.They do look great, but they can mess up your tires."
5,Ballpark Book Review,I have 3 boys and they all LOVE Baseball. They love sitting and looking at the photos in this book and reading about the different ballparks.
3,"Great idea, but a stretch","The book is very egalitarian, and it does not dump on any park, it tries to say nice things about every park, and sometimes it comes off as a stretch.Each chapter begins with a lovely, impressionist style (I think, art appreciation was a long time ago for me) panting of the ballpark from behind home plate, with little arrows denoting the landmarks. They've managed to find enough so that the young parks have as many landmarks as the classics. Again, some of these I felt were a stretch.The prose is sentimental and it pushes all the right buttons, it makes you swell or tear up in pride as you read about your favorite park, but its a bit heavy handed.Overall, a good book, though I wish they would focus more on a few parks."
5,Listen to this Loudly...,"If for no other reason, acquire this to gain access to the live (and long) version of Ashes Are Burning. This alone is worth the price of admission. I chanced to see this group when they were alive and well and this song says all. A wonderful blend of intensity and nary an elecrtic guitar (save the bass) to be heard, yet there is nothing lacking. The vocals are suburb. This group influenced everyone including King Crimson, Yes and Genisis. Even Frank Zappa had kind words. Unfortunate that they went away and the liner notes explain this quite fully. Fortunate that this survives in CD format for anyone with interest to enjoy. And, should you be able, do turn up the volume."
2,It does hold the camera,"This is probably the most basic camera case that can be made. I really like my Dimage Z2 camera but it's unusual shape makes it nearly impossible to find a protective camera bag in any of the usual places. That said the best thing about this case is the fact that the camera fits inside properly.Unfortunately, the only thing holding the camera in is a 1/4 inch diameter velcro pad under the flap. I will not trust that 2 cent piece of velcro to hold my $400 camera in while I climb a rock on the side of a mountain or a simple flight of stairs.The backside of the camera has a beltloop. This is the only way to carry it other than hold it in your hands. Of course if you use the beltloop then you have to trust that 2 penney velcro spot with your expensive camera again.Overall this case will be fine for storing my camera, but I am still looking for something that I can actually carry it in."
3,a good basic overview,"This could be far more detailed and offer more explanation for the money, but it's not bad for a beginning."
4,"Great Book, Highly informative, and a Good read",Great book that holds invaluable knowledge on mushroom cultivation with info that could take days even weeks to find on the net. (trust me i looked). Could have been a little more specific on some of the methods and could have used more diagrams and pictures to help the reader visualize the methods being discussed. All in all it is a great book that every beginner magic mycologist should pick up.
1,i rather be dead,music to take yer medication by ! or to slip into unconsciousness-i rather be dead than listen to this stuff ! diabetics beware !!
2,Cheap,"Heats up fast, have to unplug it so that does not catch fire. Don't buy it, not worth the money"
3,I am so tired of adjectives like Pompous and pretentious...,"...Words too often used for prog bands. The same could be said of any punk band, POMPOUS asses PRETENDING to be musicians. Let's face it, either you love ELP or you hate them. If you love them, then you would know that all their first five albums are 5 star albums.If you don't like them, then all their albums are 1 star albums. How could these guys give Tarkus only 3 stars. There is nothing pretentious or pompous about ELP. They were awesome musicians who knew how to compose complicated, yet very exciting music. They were the Bachs and Beethovins of our times. If you aren't into it, don't listen to it, but please stop calling them pompous and pretentious."
1,First Alert Horrible Quality,3 of these failed between year 1 and year 2. As someone said how fun it is when the unit alarms for no reason in the middle of the night. Kitchen unit goes off when kitchen is warm . Will never buy this brand again.
1,Terrible,"Terrible, just terrible. My unit went off on a false alarm, and I practically had to tear it apart to get it to silence. Since the bracket is mounted on my wall, I just went ahead and bought a new unit that was exactly the same. That one malfunctioned as soon as it came out of the box. Even with a brand new battery, it wouldn't stop chirping with the low battery signal. It's a piece of junk."
3,Inaccurate but Informative,"Although this book is fictional it is a good source of information to glean a bit of perspective of what the slaves, my ancestors, may have faced in America. For a person to purposely think in a manner explained in this book is chilling and absolutely evil."
1,Book is dreadful,"No one who has ever looked at, let alone read, an early 18th century pamphlet could possibly believe this to be genuine. It is so tranparently fraudulent that to give it any credence whatsoever is to expose oneself to ridicule. The atrocities of slavery are already well-documented; this drivel contributes nothing."
5,Book: Do I Have to Take Violet?,The book is in very good condition. It was shipped quickly. It has been out of print for many years. It was my daughter's favorite -- so glad to get it.
2,Overwritten pretentious drivel,"The plot is elaborate, yet unrewarding, the style tiresome and forced, and the cardboard characters altogether uninteresting, except to the author. Foucault's Pendulum and The Name of the Rose do what Norfolk was trying to do--but do it well; buy one of them instead."
4,"Good bits, but read on....","I just purchased a set of four of these from Home Depot for less than the cost of this one. They are 6, 8, 10, and 12.The picture shows the bit fully extended, which is adjusted through the use of a small allen wrench (not included).It does a find job of cutting clean divots, but I am not a fine woodworker yet, so my standards may not be as exacting as some. If you have the DeWalt or Stanley 1/4"" quick change adaptor, it will fit in there as well, as you can tell from the narrowing of the collar 1/2 inch up the stem."
1,Terrible for infants,"The image of these blocks on Amazon is misleading; these foam blocks are very small and could be a choking hazard for infants and toddlers. Also, the materials smell of strong (toxic?), petro-chemicals. We are disappointed with this purchase and plan on returning or discarding the blocks."
5,Great Blocks!,I bought these blocks for my 21-month-old niece for Christmas and they are just great. They are soft so if your child likes to throw things no one gets hurt! I am thinking of purchasing them for my son who is 20 months old and of course loves throwing!
5,The real deal,"No tips, no hints, just 10 actual tests. The hardest thing about the LSAT is not the questions, but the short amount of time you are given to solve them. By taking these 10 tests under simulated test conditions you can figure out strategies that work for you (as opposed those that work for 3 out of 5 Kaplan students). Where most books only include 3 or 4 tests this one gives you over twice that and the tests are authentic. The price is right and after taking all ten of these you will have no surprises come test day. My final score on the LSAT was right where I expected it to be thanks to this book."
2,Horrible,"This game is pathetic, way to easy and the Season mode is a Huge JOKE, im sad that Kobe had to endorse this game. No game now a days should have a season mode where you can't continue into year 2, and so on."
2,review from Roma,"Hello music fan - here is 'Alto' from Italia - I return this cd because it was too ""hollywood"" for me - it sound like nothing like what I expect - i like the lofi of Savage Isles more. I like a lot better the old cd Savage Isle because it sound not so 'hollywood produceri' - for me this is too many people that try to make it like a heavy metal record. I say to sayve the money for ""savage island"" - there is still some GOOD song on this disc thouhg, i like 'pier 13' and 'the Creeper' is molto molto. the organs is very well played and the fuzz guitars sounds cool. I say this because the records is expensive for me here and I don't like to be dissappoint. ciao!"
4,Small but mighty,"I ordered a pair of these along with the cubic zirconia. When they arrived I didn't realize how small they were. But upon examination, they look sturdy and well made. They are perfect for everyday wear. The sterling silver backing did not react to my skin. The price was perfect. Sabrina Silver shipped my order promptly and I received the earrings within 3 days. Since they were very small, nice touch putting both of them in the same box."
5,Incredible!,"Ms. Boettcher has written an epic! Although this book is in an unusual writing style that took me some time to get used to, the story is fascinating, the characters so real I felt like they were friends by the end of the book, and the love scenes very spicy hot. I was very looking forward to reading a sequal to follow up on all of the characters, but there isn't one yet? Oh, please, Ms. Boettcher, give us a sequal as soon as possible!"
5,Have A Good Laugh!,"This book was recommende to my daughter by a college professor in 1990. I bought it at the time and read it lying down. I laughed so hard, I had to sit up... I have bought several copies since then as gifts, as I did this latest one. I lecture on the Healing Power Of Humor, and use lines form this book. It is a book you do not have to read from cover to cover in order, you can simply open a page and have a good laugh any time."
2,Anguished English is an anguishing read.,"As an English teacher and a linguist by hobby, I was excited to recieve this for a long plane ride. Thank goodness I couldn't wait and started reading early. It would have been really sad to have dragged Anguished English overseas instead of something that's actually entertaining. This book is somewhat interesting, and has at least two pages worth of excerpts humorous enough to share with a class, but I feel that for so little real humor, I wasted my money buying an entire book. Now I must confess, I've only read half the book (trying to find the stamina to continue), so I just might find a few more funny pages, but so far I'm disappointed, and if I weren't a teacher, I wouldn't finish or keep the book at all. It's all right, but it's simply not the side-splittingly funny book I was led to expect."
4,"in the ""run, don't walk"" category","The review from Aug 2002 does a nice job of going through the highlights of the book and so do not bear repeating. Instead, I would like to share with you the impact the book has had on me. Twice in the past 3 years, I have faced a significant crisis. Each time I have gone and read this book and come out feeling stronger, replinished and ready to take on life. I literally keep a cheat sheet of what Seligman postulates and read it every now and then. Its easy to dimiss what he says as common-sense or obvious. The basic tenets of good parenting, a good marriage and a good life are common sense-driven as well, yet so many of us fail at them so much of the time. I think of this book as one of life's instruction manuals. Read it and it all starts to make a little more sense."
4,"Enjoyable, enlightening and helpful","This book was recommended by the professor in an Open Yale psychology course I watched (by the way, highly recommend that too-- Psych 101 with Professor Paul Blum). This is an excellent and very enlightening book-- not schlocky, not lightweight-- with lots of helpful and illuminating information on how to go about bringing meaning and joy to your life. I don't have children, but I think the chapter on raising kids is something every parent should read. I went online and took the tests on the author's website, which was eye-opening as well-- and a nice complement to the book. I've recommended it to a number of friends and it's changed the way I look at myself. I catch myself being pessimistic now, for instance. If you're interested in the subject of happiness from an academic perspective, then this is the book for you."
5,Not even one half complaint.,I got the book just a few days after the purchase and it was in new condition as described. Perfect transaction.
5,This book is exactly what you think it is...,"It's a great book for people interested in Positive Psychology. Further more it's a great book for people in general. You're not alone, you're not strange, you're normal and you can become a happier person. Get the book, read it, and implement it."
4,Authentic Happiness,Authentic HappinessExcellent book.I like the way he helps people think about where they are going instead of being problem focused.
3,Great CD but damaged,"As usual Reba is wonderful, her music is beautiful.But the CD is damaged and of course I didn't know ituntil I played it so it was to late to send back fora quality copy. I was very disappointed a couple ofitems I have gotten lately have been like that."
4,Great Gift for Displaced Southerner,My brother-in-law is from Alabam and Southern through and through. He's lived in New England for over thirty years. I always try to send him Southern treats as gifts. He loves good country ham. This is a great gift item. He loved it.
5,LOVE IT!!!!,"I bought this video for my sister's birthday. We are really into workout videos. BEST VIDEO EVER!!! It is so much fun! We do it almost every night, and it's a great workout. I sweat like crazy, and my muscles are actually really sore afterwards."
2,Bits are too tapered,"The bits are sharp enough to drill, and the countersink part is adjustable, but if you are supposed to adjust it to the length of the wood screw (i was using #6 3/4"" screw), you will not get an even pilot hole, the pilot hole is too tapered and the screw will not go in. I guess if you change the size to be larger then it would go in better, but then your pilot hole would be larger than the screw possibly going through the other side of the workpiece. I had to use my regular untapered drill bit and then use this piece as a countersink bit."
4,A classic book in Orthopedics,"A classic book in Orthopedic(Fractures). discussing types of fractures, management, complications...etc. organized according to body part. some details in management including types of physiotherapy, manipulation .... . each chapter have an anatomic classification of fractures."
1,"This is a review, NOT THE BOOK","Please do not be tricked like I was. I thought this was an ebook download. The entire title stating that this was a BOOK REVIEW did not show up until after my ""download"". I had to call Amazon to get my money refunded and explain to them how this was not right, and wonder how many other people were tricked like I was. All I wanted to do was read it to my niece, because I remember this book from 5th grade. But instead now I have to order by mail, which would have just been easier in the first place, had I not been TRICKED into thinking this was the entire book. Who would pay $5.95 to buy a book review, when there are free book reviews about this book all over the internet. I hope no one else falls victim to this scam and I thank Amazon for taking care of the refund and agreeing to look in to this for me."
2,Not an Easy Study,"I have found the book difficult to apply to my real life. The case histories shared seem promising and interesting, but when I ask,""How does this mirror my own life, and how do I apply the information?"" I can't come up with the answers. I am pragmatic, very ""bottom line,"" and this book isn't.After reading through page 100 and still finding no clear directives, I became bored with it and turned to a more consice, and more interactive book on trading psychology (an ebook titled, ""Emotion Free Trading"" by Larry Levine, available through [...]: much easier to interpret and utilize).I gave the book two stars because it is professionally written, and may be suitable to other personality types."
3,In My Opinion,"I bought this soundtrack because I saw the music video for k.d.lang's Ridin' The Rails. Unfortunately I found that is the only good song on the soundtrack. Most of the music on this disk wasnt in the movie and I was hoping to hear a lot of the music from the movie...hense buying the soundtrack.But at least it was in good condition, it shipped fast, and I had no problems. I just wish I'd have saved my money and bought the soundtrack to Doubt instead."
2,after shave was dried out already!,well I got it cheaper than retails stotes but its after shave was dried out already!
4,Ports of Paradise,I heard this music many years ago while studying in Hawaii. I was so glad to find that it was still available. It is beautiful
1,Don't waste your money.,"I consider myself an avid collector or surf and garage music from the 60's and modern times, and I have to consider this record the worst I ever bought. I plan on turning mine into an ashtray, don't waste your money."
4,Just picked up Boss Martians 13 Evil Tales and it ROCKS!,"""Hot Foot!"" KICKS this one into HIGH GEAR - really great FUZZ from this ""surf"" band! The brutal rocker ""She's Creepy!"" could have been on a Raiders album - all vocal songs on this disc are FUN! More vocals please! The surf tunes are faithful 1960's surf music and is a refreshing change of pace from the overproduced stuff out there today. Great release! High points are ""Hot Foot"", ""She's Creepy!"" and ""Outlaw Drag""."
4,Judo Techniques & Tactics,The book was in good condition. It was cheap priced and well worth the wait because of the condition it was in. Thank you.
1,Basic stuff,"The title of this books ""Judo techniques and tactics"" is misleading. Instead of getting a detailed description of the special techniques and experiences used by Jim Pedro this is only yet another introductory book on judo."
2,CDs Don't Work - Surface Info,"Tried to install using the CDs and when asked for the second CD, Red Hat installation kept saying that it wasn't the right CD. The CD was clean and read the 1st CD without any problems.The book isn't really a crash course for someone who knows nothing. In my opinion it's a quick surface review for someone like me who has used Unix/Linux a while ago and needs some quick info to get my memory going.To be honest I really only bought the book for the CDs and thought the book, would be a good refresher. If only the CDs worked I'd given it a higher rating."
5,Truly Exceptional Bonsai Book,"I just read Bonsai Life Histories and it is the answer to every bonsai enthusiasts dreams. It is truly exceptional. I have been looking for a book to span most of the bonsai experience spectrum and this fits the bill - and so so much more.I own and operate a small bonsai retail store/nursery/studio and I teach classes for novices and more experienced growers here at the studio and am often asked for book recommendations. This one is at the top of the list. Even with my 14 years experience in bonsai, I found it very refreshing, as it teaches by example, rather than just instructing.The author is both a skilled bonsai practitioner and an astute writer. Most books are blessed with one or the other (and a few have neither!). I appreciate this book and thoroughly recommend it."
5,What an inspirational book!,"The way in which the author has produced exceptional bonsai from material that is easily obtainable by us all, made for captivating reading. Very helpful too, is the way in which the author has made the book easy to read and understand.I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in bonsai, whether their collection is large or small, and they are novices or experienced enthusiasts."
3,Good quality for the price,"these are really nice earrings. the only thing that bothered me was since the item picture was so close, i thought they would be a bit bigger. other than that they are really cute. so, if u like larger studs to be seen from afar, go for a 7mm or 8mm."
3,Not as goof as I rememver,"Pwerhaps my tastes have changed; I owned this album back in the 90s and really likd it then. Somehow it got lost or moved onto another home, and recently I decided to replace it. Some of the music is quite good but it is dated and doesn't always hold the test of time to my ears."
2,This book was written by functional illiterates,"The authors are great PHP programmers, I have no doubt, but terrible writers. I do not recommend this book. Like most bad technical writers, they make a big production about trivial concepts, then gloss over difficult concepts without explaining them in detail."
2,Tepid Instrumentals,"The Bomboras ""Savage Island"" is pleasant listening for instrumental fans, but nothing more. When I had listened to it I realized that nothing had really stood out and grabbed my attention. If you were having a small dinner party, and wanted unobtrusive background music, this CD might be a good choice. Also, as a guitar fan, I could really do without the organ.By no means is this a bad disc--but after listening to other ""new"" surf-guitar groups like the Penetrators, Aqua Velvets and those wild Space Cossacks, this one sounds very tame."
5,Nothing short of Brilliant,"This is probably my favorite recording of Le Sacre. Besides being a virtuoso pianist, Achatz's transcription is freaking amazing! I know the piece inside and out, and I can hear every instrument through this transcription. The Firebird and Petrushka are great, as well. But Le Sacre is the real star here."
5,Great book for challenging math problems,"I am a high school math teacher. I have found this to be a great resource for a pre-algebra class. The step-by-step, prompted, and independent project exercises provide a great way for students to work towards proficiency in many skills that they might need in real life. Unlike many text books that give a scatter shot of word problems for any given math skill set, this book offers a project based problem that requires students to think of the different math skills needed to solve the problem. I found that my students enjoy this approach. With so much focus on reading and writing skills, this book also provides great prompts to held students see how reading and writing are critical when solving math problems. It is an excellent book that will challenge students to think. I recommend it, highly."
3,Wayne Gretzky Trivia Book,"My grandson likes the book very much. I don't know much about it. I'm neutral on the content. (I didn't buy it for me.) As I was researching the book, however, the price seemed to change (upward) considerably compared to the original price that I saw at first. I found this disturbing. Nevertheless, I bought the book."
3,"More of Mood Music, but great for that!","I was assuming this CD to be more a straightforward collection of Traditional music, but instead it's more of a mood-music vibe. Good at that though. The girlfriend puts it on when she's having difficulty sleeping, so it's safe to say that it's calming stuff."
3,Fathers uncooked sliced country ham,I ordered a 16-17 lb sliced and packaged ham and a bacon varitiy package. The order arrived quickly and was very well packaged. The bacons were great and the ham.... not so great. I express some dissatisfaction with the ham and was given a complete refund. No questions asked. Thank you fathers.
4,"All New Material, Fresh Out Of The Cradle","Lindsey's latest solo work, and probably the most normal. Dont get me wrong, his expiremental stuff is great, but it's nice to hear something different. Now I'm not saying it isnt expiremental either. My personal favorites are Countdown, All My Sorrows, and the lonely Street Of Dreams. Other good songs to check out are You Do Or You Dont in which Lindsey previews the ""somebodys got to see this through/All the world is laughing at you"" in Bleed To Love Her on the new Fleetwood Mac CD. Doing What I Can and Say We'll Meet Again are other good ones. Highly recomended and highly enjoyed by me!"
2,Pleasant Enough but No Staying Power,"It's really hard to believe this release is almost 10 years old. Seems like just yesterday that Clinton was elected and this album was new.I have all of the Fleetwood Mac albums, all the Nicks solos, all the Buckingham solos, plus the '84 McVie solo. And out of all of them I probably listened to this one the least of all.This release is just too slick sounding and over-cooked for my ears. There's just nothing compelling enough here to make me want to pull it out and listen again.Fleetwood Mac was much better than the sum of its parts. It's a shame they couldn't have put their differences aside in the 80s and 90s and spent more time collaborating on Fleetwood Mac albums.This is not a bad record, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but die-hard fans."
5,Just a quick note of comment,"This is one of my favorite albums, but I do wonder if anyone really *looked* at the pricing structure for the MP3s. Items 1, 7, and 11 are very brief tracks and it seems to me they could be marked down to .25c for individual purchase. They are not worth as much as the full length songs on the album by comparison.That said, the album as a whole is magnificent, and ""Countdown"", ""You Do or You Don't"", and ""Don't Look Down"" stand out as iconic masterpieces."
5,An overlooked classic. Buy it.,"I just got some new speakers and popped this in as a test - Lindsey plays a couple quick classical/acoustic solos that are beautiful, and a great test of the dynamics in any speaker. I've got many hundreds of CDs, and whenever I listen to this disc, I'm simply amazed at the incredible quality of the songwriting, musicianship, and production, end-to-end. I'm a big fan of rock and even hard rock, and think that Mr. Buckingham, as stated in a different review here, is right up there with the best - no question about it - even though my Mom would love this, too. (It's a little more ""adult pop"" than what I normally listen to.) The songs are ALL solid, and the production/arrangements and layering of instruments, vocals, etc. is - in a word - perfect. If Christine McVie and Stevie Nicks sang a few songs on this, and it was released after ""Rumours,"" it would have outsold ""Rumours"" easily... I think it's that good."
4,Seminal analysis of why those of us living in the west are doing so on borrowed time,"As an American History buff, I loved the deep dive into the importance of water as a determining factor in how the West was developed captured by the phrase that ""water flows toward money and power."""
3,NOT BAD X,"I dunno about this cd as a whole but I LOVE ""RIDE OR DIE"" ITS BUMBPIN'. ITS THE BEAT AND CHORUS THAT ARE CRAZY. PLEASE LISTEN TO IT. I ALSO LIKE TOUGH GUY, MUTHA F****< HEY NOW AND SCENT OF A WOMEN, WHICH IS THE NEXT SINGLE. THOSE ARE BASICKLY TEH HOTTEST TRACKS. I PREFERED XZIBIT BACK IN DA DAY, U KNOW, WHEN HE WAS HUNGRY. BUT NOW, HE AINT AS HUNGRY SO HE AINT GOTTA TRY AS HARD. BUT HE STILL COOL TO ME. HE KNOWS HOW TO HANDLE BUSINESS, CAUSE HE IN ""PIMP MY RIDE"" AND IN UPCOMING MOVIES LIKE THE SEQUEL TO ""XXX"". PROPS."
3,Good Album!,"this is good album from X, it's not as good as restless but it's better then ManVMachine.best songs:Cold WorldRide or diehey nowTough guyback to the way it wasOUTLAW"
5,Junk Food Lover's Delight!!,"Best little horde of junk food to eat watching television,or anywhere!Arrived on time and beyond my expectations.Would recommend for junk foodlovers,everywhere:)"
2,Disappointing,"Well, like all other 900mhz DSS phones I've heard, this one has poor sound quality (I had reason to hope since I own one of Panasonic's excellent 900mhz analog phones). The sidetone isn't as bad as what I've heard in other 900 DSS phones, but it's still there and the sound isn't close to analog. I called my wife as a test, and she said it sound like I was talking in a box. Alas, for those of you wanting a phone with digital security that sounds good, I have no answer. The Panasonic 2.4gig phones sound good, but are apparently not fully secure as they transmit partially in analog... sigh."
1,REALLY not a bargain!,"We bought this model on a whim at Costco last week, anticipating three long car trips, and hoping this would help the kids pass the time. The player was easy to set up, and worked right away...for about an hour. Then the screen died, and could not be fixed. When we returned it to Costco today, there were SEVERAL others behind the return desk, and the saleswoman said their whole shipment was bad! USE CAUTION!"
1,Returned two for a full refund...,"I was very excited when I purchased this portable DvD player for my daughters. I purchased it at Target for a reasonable price. Unfortunatly, after playing only two movies, the screen went completely blank and I was unable to get it to work again. I exchanged it at Target (hoping it was just a dud). However, after watching about 6 movies on the new one, the screen started going blank again. It was very frustrating. Sometimes you could get it to come back on by fiddling with it, but this meant you had to start the movie over and skip back to where you were. I do not reccomend buying this unit. I guess you really do get what you pay for. I'm now doing research and trying to decide which brand is the best...."
1,De Walt Disapointment,"I have been trying to mount a heavy antique mirror over my fireplace. I tried drilling into it - it's old brick from 1906, covered with 1/2"" sheetrock. I couldn't get into the brick with my usual De Walt bits, so I picked up their masonry bits, advertised as specifically for driling into brick. No luck with these either. if you can't count on De Walt, who can you count on?I'd give this product 0 stars, if Amazon let me."
3,A difficult entrance into the world of Faulkner,"This was the first William Faulkner novel I have read and I can happily say it will not be the last. I enjoyed ""Light In August"" despite some difficulty getting into the story and the constant changing of tenses. Having read some of Faulkner's short stories, the writing style and themes were easy enough to understand. What I particularly enjoyed was the confusing tenses, in the end I realized their importance. This is a wonderful novel about the continuity of our lives. If you have patience and love for great story telling this novel will be something you enjoy and something you can use in your own life."
3,Lost in Space,"I love this series, so I enjoyed the episode. It's not one of the better episodes, in my opinion, but it is very predictable with regard to the series."
3,"Like the set, but poor productions of the DVD media and copy","Well, first, I will say that I like having the 1st season on DVD media.However, the two things that bother me and WILL affect the next season's purchase are:1) the DVDs appear to be of the home-burned type as they do have ""stick-on"" labels. The pictures and text are not printed directly to the DVD itself.2) being a person who does lots of video work and makes DVD productions at home, I was disappointed to find that it appears that the episodes where taken from a TV screen rather than a proper digital from tape or digital from film manner.Therefore, you can see the scan lines as you would on a regular TV set. Even on a new, large screen TV with Progressive Scan OR even on the computer screen using a very good DVD player, you can see the interlacing. This is very poor.If the film or tape would have been copied directly, this would not be the case."
5,A trip down memory lane,"I read all the reviews, and it seems like most of them are from guys with a crush on Penny. Well, some of us girls with dads who were scifi buffs were also raised on Lost in Space, and we love it too. What a wholesome and fantastic show (even if it is somewhat funny viewed by adult eyes). I have kids now, and you guessed it, I bought the DVD set so I can introduce them to the show (minus the commercials we'd also view on regular TV). Bring on season 2 and 3 already!"
5,"""Oh how Lovely!"" --Dr. Smith","LIS was a big part of my childhood. I'm 48 and plan to purchase this as a X-mas present for my brother. We all grew up loving the show and to this day still mimmick the lines of Dr. Smith. In my opinion I believe that Jonathan Harris character of Dr.Smith truly made the show. If it was Allen's decision or the Exec's to turn Smith from a villian to a scaredy cat /comedian it was pure genius that made the show. It allowed Harris to shine in this role.Of course to this day one of my family's favorite episodes was ""The Promise Planet."" -----""It's like freaky man! Real freaky! We're going to freak out together!""""Dr.Smith what happened to you?"" --Will""I'm way out man, like the rest of you cats!"" --Smith""Wow man you're ready to groove!""--Penny""Yeah! AND We have to persuade William.....to GROOVE WITH US!""LOL.Thanks for the memories."
3,Dewalt Rapid Load Drill Bits,"I love rapid load drill bits, have been using them for many years. I really like Dewalt, three of my drills are Dewalt, but I was disappointed with these bits ... they just don't cut as well as I would have liked."
1,Not designed well for orioles,"Although this is a nice looking feeder, it is very impractical. The only reason I gave it even one star is because the hummingbirds like to drink from it. The basic problem with it is that the the length of the perches are way too short for the size of an oriole. They land on them and cannot drink. They then try to reach around to the next hole to drink and cant't reach, get frustrated and leave. Now, if a hummingbird can sit on the perch and drink wouldn't you think an oriole might be too big? They are!"
4,Better Quality than Most,"I've received good durability out of my DeWalt hex shank drill bits. The ""black oxide"" may not be as ""fancy"" as some of its competitors, but some of the cheaper brands are too brittle and just chip/fall apart. I would give it 5 stars if it was priced cheaper. 1/4"" is a popular size and although the bit sets are more economical, you wind up collecting too many odd sizes that are not used."
5,Classic Ellison a link to Harlan's present endeavors,"I have viewed this episode several times, both on television and on tape. Harlan Ellison (script and story) demonstrates his early expertise with speculative story-writing in an age when doubt and suspicion ran rampant among television producers. Okay, so that still happens, but this production is a masterpiece of classic television that pushes the limits of conventional story writing for television, both then and now.An interesting note: according to the Lurker's Guide to Babylon Five, a fan website and designated authority on all things B5, Harlan Ellison had discussed writing a sequal episode to ""Demon"" for the Babylon 5 series, for which he served as creative consultant. Unfortunately the episode, ""Demon on the Run"" was never produced, but this is a good sign that all Babylon 5 fans should seriously check out ""Demon With a Glass Hand"" and consider it an interesting perspective to their shared fiction."
5,Very well-done Cartier-Bresson retrospective,"I am a big fan of Cartier-Bresson's photography, so this review could be considered a little biased. This is a great book -- lots of Cartier-Bresson's photos (all my favourites, and there are many), well-printed, with just enough text to add some substance to the book without overwhelming the images. There are even a bunch of photos of Cartier-Bresson at the end for those who are curious what he looks like. A few of his sketches/paintings and some information on his films are also included, which may interest some. The only downside is the book weighs a ton, and is an awkward size that doesn't fit in my bookcase. ;-) Highly recommended."
2,Picture sure looks nice,"Although this is supposed to be a knife, there is no blade. Just a peice of shiny metal. Not just dull and needing sharpened, no it is just a shiny flat peice of metal that will break if I begin to sharpen. One of these blades would be excellent in someones zombie defense aresnal. However, find a seller with a product that is real, because I couldn't even cut butter with this even if I heated the ""blade"""
3,It's OK,"For starters, the knife did not come with a full scabbard as shown in the photo. I knew I wasn't getting a scabbard though, so I'm not sure why the description now says it has one. What it does have is a mini-scabbard, which basically just covers the point of the blade. It's about an inch long.It's an OK knife, with a decent heft to it. The blade is not very sharp at all, but I did not expect it to be. This is not a blade to trust your life with, it is a blade to dazzle your friends with.With the very low price of some very high quality knives, one could've expected just a slightly better product. But it made a teenager feel like a Commando, so I'd say it's worth it."
2,Item different from what is shown,"This item lacks the ""rubber finger grips for comfortable use"" that is in the product description, and is also physically different from the picture shown here. See my uploaded pic for what item actually looks like."
4,A DePalma Classic!,"First off the unrated version is THE best cut of this classic. It's a stylish, suspenseful, ultra-erotic, and bloody psycho thriller. And, the blu-ray transfer is great, as are the extras. A must buy!"
2,thankyouverymuch,"this book was nothing great,in fact it did not seem to fit together,the stories were strewn about with different time periods of Elvis' life, this book was mediocre at best. i expected more from charlie hodge, the book i liked was the book by the memphis mafia."
1,Not good for cooking,This item is not good for cooking (such as torching a creme brulee) as its a pain to light.
1,Its just a pencil torch,All the pictures and writing lead you to think this is self lighting. Benzomatic even puts a trigger on unit. You will still have to carry a lighter. I returned item probably lost more returning than keeping. Its really sad. I wish some one would refund my pain in this purchase. BUYER BEWARE!
5,"Buy this, buy this, buy this.","This is a great cd, choosing the most hard-edged songs from The Land of Rape and Honey and The Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste.Basically, they make these already harsh songs even more darker, harsher, and crazier, just listen to the end of Stigmata!All in all, there's not much to say. I got this cd before the Land of Rape and Honey and The Mind..., and once I did purchase the albums, I instantly fell in love them. So, get this song as a introductory, if you will, to the sounds of The Mind, Land of Rape, and also, Psalm 69."
5,WOW,"ministry is awesome! this short yet stunning live EP still killes me. this is headbanging music of the best kind. loud, loose, barely controlable, indusrometal! Deity will have me headbanging untill my ears bleed and check out the eleven minute so what for an awesome electrical journey."
3,Convevience in power drilling & driving-mixed blessings,"My initial impressions of the DeWalt Rapid Load Set was good. The kit is well stocked with the most important fittings for driling\driving and the components are high quality. However I was disappointed that I couldn't comfortably release components in the quick connector without using two hands. It feels awkward and combersome. I finally settled with the Craftsman ""Speed-Lock"" system. It has a true single hand operation of the quick connect tool and has a smaller diameter, which tends to not get in the way of the work!"
4,Great Job,"I have no complaints at all. The price was very affordable, and the mirror got here fast. And it looks just like the original.Keep up the great job"
5,Perfecto,This item was perfect it was exaclty what I orders and fit the description 100%. Recommend to anyone who needs a Japanese or American made Camry.
2,Best Song Not Included,"The best song in the movie is Blink 182's ""All the Small Things."" This punk song is played during the rolling credits at the end of the movie. For some reason, it is not included on the album."
2,...... selection,Good news: The movie has some amazing music in it! Go see it! And again! Bad news: A lot of that music isn't on this album... Someone already started a list with great songs that were in the movie and not on the album (...................... Song 2 etc etc) and I can add one: Angel Of The Morning from I believe The Pretenders (when Drew Barrymore wakes up next to Tom Green :-). Keep the list growing folks!
3,Unreadable pages,"The book looked ok as far as condition but some pages were hard to read there were paragraphs that the ink from the words were smudged looked like a bad copy.. But I didn't pay too much for it so like the saying goes "" you get what you pay for"""
3,What to Expect!,I was disappointed with these chairs.THE UP SIDE. The chair is reasonably sturdy and had no damage when it arrived. The seat is high making the chair easy to sit in and get out of. The shipping time was reasonable. The chair was inexpensive.THE DOWN SIDE. The chair is covered in a poor quality Chinese pleather. The material is stamped with a pattern to resemble leather. This is a chair that looks good in the picture and from 10 feet or more away.SUMMARY. Expect some type of low quality pleather covering and you won't be disappointed. I believe that there are probably better chairs out there but for the price these chairs are average to fair.
5,Happy with the Rip Stick,"We bought this Rip Stick for our granddaughter's 9th birthday and within a couple of days she was zooming around on it and having a great time! Of course we insist that she wear a helmit, and at first she was wearing knee pads, but she loves it."
3,A little behind the times...,"Don't get me wrong, I thought it was a fine book, hence the 3 stars. But this book just seemed to harp on the importance of not giving out your social, shredding documents, and other very basic things. I was expecting more ""con men"" stories and tips like that, but mostly it was about check fraud. Also some annoying parts were where they would tell you ""How to protect yourself!"" and then they would give advice to empoyers or business regarding data storage, but no tips to me the consumer on what to do. It does make it clear that much of the data about me out there is out of my control. All in all, it was fine for what it was, but I don't think I was the target audience."
5,Worthy Second Effort,"This is a fabolous album that today's pop/r&b singers like Ashanti, B2K, Britney etc. would be hard pressed to created. I love the songs on this album like ""Romantic"", ""Ritual of Love"", ""Walkin' the Dog"", ""Tears of Joy"", ""Do Unto Me"" & many more. I suggest fans of today's pop/r&b to check out all Karyn White cd's, you should enjoy it. Karyn's voice is beautiful!"
1,Styrofoam in a box,These were the absolute worst crackers I have ever tasted. If Styrofoam could be served in a box it would taste like these. Save your money!
3,OK if you're really hungry,"If you're wanting to feel good about munching mindlessly, you'll like these crakers. It's not that they're bad, they're not as good as Cheeset's. On the healthy side,they're better."
2,Not a great skin flick,"There were some brief nude shots scattered through the movie. The movie description suggests some sex scenes, but there aren't any. Basically its one of those ""I'll have sex with you if you kill everyone else"" type plots were she turns everyone against each other. Kind of a waste of money, but there were some good topless shots..."
3,"Great tv mini-series, however..","Unfortunately, some of the original footage has been cut. I distinctly recall scenes that were not included in this edition (?) Not sure why the original mini was edited, but due to that only 3 stars...otherwise, the dvd's arrived and played in tip-top shape."
2,dvds are poor quality,"The movie itself is great, however the dvds are skipping, many times the words and and movies are not running at the same time. We are returning them."
1,Not worth buying,I purchased this specifically for the David Cassidy segment of the programme but IT IS NOT ON THERE! The DVD says it is 2 hours long - it isn't! It only lasts just over 1 hour. Amazon did replace it with another copy but it was exactly the same! I assume it is a fault with the original production. Obviously if you are interested in a certain segment and it is on the first hour then you will be quite happy but if you want the whole 2 hours don't buy this until you know for sure that you are buying a complete copy.
2,no use,"I've used it for about 7 months. If there is any difference, I am losing more hair!!Please use it with causion!"
4,Nioxin Scalp tx,"I don't really think I've been using the system long enough to know for sure that it's actually working or not. But it seems like I've been losing less hair in the shower and it does seem a little fuller. So far I'm happy, but only time will tell!"
2,Really just a reply,"This won't work for anyone else, either. Theoretically, it should be great to give yourself some L-Dopa, the agonist for dopamine. Combined with 5-HTP, it should convert into Seratonin with some help from B6...Unfortunately, the reality is that dopamine can't cross the blood-brain barrier. That means it won't get into your brain, where it can help you. Some of this might get in there, but if you really need dopamine, get a doctor to prescribe you carbidopa/levodopa(=L-Dopa). Carbidopa prevents breakdown in the bloodstream. If you're into the pharmaceutical avoidance trip, you're out of luck..."
4,Brilliant!,"This is how metal should be! As heavy as this album. It's simple: good songs + good sound = good album!! Highlights: ""Invisible Empire"", ""Got MILF"" and ""The Amp Hymn"". Buy this one now if you're a true metal fan!!!!"
1,scary,"You cannot tighten the wheels of these skates so they are very dangerous. you will have to pull your child around so they do not crack their head open. They are not functional, maybe in sand they would work OK."
2,Daughter loves it but...,the area around the velcro has already started to fray. This was a Christmas gift so she has not had them long. I think that the quality should be better. The knee pads and elbow pads do seem to protect well.
1,LEAKY PACKAGE,"I've been so excited to receive this perfume. I've owned it before and love the way it smells. However, DO NOT BUY this item from Amazon. It came bubble wrapped in a box. I could smell it from outside the box which I thought was a little strange. So, when I opened the package, the perfume had leaked out EVERYWHERE! I am so irritated. So much leaked from this 32 ounce bottle that I might as well have paid tor a 24 ounce!! Don't waste your time on this. You can find this perfume in stores and the price isn't much different. Now my entire house smells like this perfume because of how much had leaked out onto the box and the bubble wrap. The bottle is cheaply constructed and it is leaking from the bottom AND the top!!! what a waste of $35!"
4,"Decent, but Not Great","A pretty good album from Joe Bonamassa, but not so good as his magnificent Blues Deluxe. He just doesn't seem to have completely found his voice on this one, but the music is still very good and highly enjoyable."
3,choked artistry,"This is some very impressive guitar work. Too bad it was not allowed to shine. I don't know who the drummer was, but someone needs to tell him that this is not a shock and awe campaign. The drummer seems to think that if he plays loud enough, he can force-feed his garbage down the listener's throat. Good drumming involves a measure taste, nuance, subtlety even. What we saw here was way over the top, an infintile approach to the instrument that simply says ""bang with stick as loud as possible""Anther example of good music ruined by one bad apple."
3,constant craving!,bought this dvd hoping for a little more than its content...upset to see her hit song constant craving missing from the list... had a laugh watching her earlier hits... but great to see her singing crying... after watching the dvd i felt like crying... but kd does posess a great voice...
3,Awesome pencil but...,"This would have been perfect unfortunately the I received a green pencil when the picture clearly shows a yellow. I didn't see anywhere that I was able to select a color but perhaps I missed that. Nonetheless for a few bucks this is a great gag gift. Not amazing quality but cmon, youre not taking the SAT with it so what do you expect. Just verify color before you order. Thanks"
5,Georgian romance fans will enjoy a wicked tale.,"~<p~ children and Tessa still amuses him. She wants his love. The night they marry, Jered travels to London to enjoy the night life. However, to his rue and confusion, Tessa follows him because she wants his soul just as she has hand her own over to his heart. <p~ into a non-stop read. The witticism of Tessa adds to the overall feeling that this is a superior book above most others from the sub-genre. Fans of historical romance will gain much pleasure and enjoyment from a splendid story.<p"
1,GARBAGE!!!!!!!!,"I CAN'T BELIEVE A 20TH CENTURY WRITER WROTE THIS BOOK. I THINK WHEN HISTORICAL ROMANCE WRITERS WRITE THEY SHOULD BE UNIQUE IN THE WAY WOMEN WHERE TREATED AND EXPECTED TO BEHAVE DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME. THIS BOOK BELITTLED TESS. INSTEAD OF HAVING HER FEET PLANTED ON THE GROUND ALL SHE WAS DOING WAS FOLLOWING HER TWO TIMING HUSBAND WHO DIDN'T DESERVE HER LOVE. SHE SHOULD LOOK AT GARWOOD'S, KANE'S AND QUICK'S WRITING. I JUST READ TILL CHAPTER 3 AND AND PUT IT DOWN. DON'T BUY OR READ THIS BOOK, IS NOT WORTH IT ESPECIALLY IF YOU KNOW A WOMAN DOESN'T HAVE TO ACT LIKE A DOG AFTER IT'S MASTER."
5,Johnny Tillotson - A Classic 60s Teen Idol,"I had forgotten just how much I love Johnny Tillotson's music until I received this album. It's been continuously in my CD player ever since!Johnny was a teen idol back in the early '60s with a string of wonderful songs, many of which he wrote himself, like 'I Can't Stop Loving You', 'It Keeps Right On A-Hurtin', 'Talk Back Trembling Lips', 'I Can't Help It (If I'm Still In Love With You)', 'Send Me The Pillow That You Dream On', 'Poetry in Motion', 'Out of My Mind', and 'Dreamy Eyes'. All these songs and 32 more are included in this 2-CD set.Johnny is also a talented and engaging performer. My daughter and I had the pleasure of catching one of his concerts in the late 80s and thought he was fantastic.This CD set is well worth the money and a treat for the listener!"
2,card unreliable with different cameras and operating systems,"I bought this card for my Canon s2is and it worked intermittently. As a flash drive it also had some issues showing files on OS X. I sent it back as defective in August 2008 and it is November 2008 and they keep on saying they will ship me a replacement. In October they said that they could not find a comparable product so it was delayed. A few weeks later they said ""it will ship out today."" I still have not received it. A call placed on Nov 11 to them and they could not figure out the status(shipped or not). I tried to save a few bucks and basically wasted my time and money. So then I just bought a San Disk 2gb sdcard which works flawlessly with my camera."
3,"Ok, but not great","I'm a huge fan of Square (games, music, even the FF movie!), and would have bought the CD regardless of the reviews. I do however agree with Kent - yes, there are some gems on the two CDs, but for the most part it feels like background music.Basically, if you're a fan you should get it. Otherwise, skip it and pick up the Chrono Cross, FFVII, or Xenogears soundtracks - you'll love those."
1,Product Description Correction,"We here at Amazon.com are sorry for an error about a product description. ""Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water"" was mislabled as being an audio cd. Instead, this product is actually an all-purpose blank disc. There are hundreds of exciting ideas that you and the whole family can use for this blank disc. It can serve as a replacement pizza cutter or a drink coaster. Kids will have tons of fun tossing the disc around as a frisbee. And with the holiday season just around the corner, you can use the all-purpose blank disc as an ornament for your christmas tree. With the all-purpose blank cd the possibilties are endless! Again, we here at Amazon.com are sorry for any confusion about this product."
1,horrible- a typical rap/rock album,"I would have given this cd maybe a half star, but of course I can't. This is one of the worst cds I have ever heard in my entire life. Songs like ""rollin"" nearly make me sick. Please don't get this."
1,This is about as horrible as spoiled chocolate pudding,"I Really Hate this album and this band, they remind me of the rap rock version of G-Unot, this album is incredibly awful, the lyrics are terrible, the drumming is terrible and everything else is terrible as well, I Blame Nerdvana for bringing this whine rock genre in and destroying music like this, and this band is the perfect example of that.Chocolate Starfish & The Hot Dog Flavored Water is a stupid sloppy messNu Metal is even worse than boy bands and hair bands (at least they can play instruments unlike nu metal b.s.)Limp Bizkit and G-Unot sucksF*ck Fred Durst & 50 Cent."
3,"some songs are good, not too many though","i'll rate all the songs on a cd, that is below average, but still underrated1 intro 5/102 hot dog 10/103 my generation 9/104 full nelson 10/105 my way 6/106 rollin 10/107 livin it up 7/108 the one 9/109 getcha groove on 3/1010 take a look around 6/1011 itll be a while 9/1012 boiler 7/1013 hold on 1/1014 rollin (another version) 5/1015 outro 1/10some decent songs but not good eno9ugh for me, i sold this album"
3,"Not bad, but please!","This album isn't bad. What could have been a great album ended up being average mainly because the only talent shown here was the ability to come up with dozens of words (not including the f word) that rhymes with the words ""Limp Bizkit"". I'm not one to sit back and try and analyze the cosmic significance of my music ... I just like to be entertained. But come on!! The level of narcissism shown in the lyrics of this album is just too much. Unless that's what you like in your music.Fred, I think it's time you (and your band) come down off your high horses and try and make some real music."
3,2nd best,"It has a few very awesome songs, but pretty much it isn't the best. I think 3 dollar bill yall$ is the best album, but this is right next to that 1. The most koolest song is Take A Look Around (MI:2 Theme). I also like Rollin, Getcha Groove On, My Generation, and It'll Be Ok.I hope this helps u in ur decision to buy this album or not."
1,erm... this is bad.,"I know this has been said countless times, but I just feel like driving this very true point in further. Limp Bizkit has no talent. None whatsoever. Fred Durst's ""look! I know how to say the F word! isn't that so Fing cool? F this, F that!"" Which does only appeal to 10 year old children too heavily influecned by Carson Daily and his homies on MTV. If you want something good then look into Black Sabbath, Godsmack, Red Hot Chili Peppers and even Metallica."
2,A complete disapointment!!,"This CD is extremely disapointing. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because Wes is still great.Here is my personal opinion on a few of the songs:Hot Dog: This song is completely immature! All Fred Durst does is say ""f*ck"" over 45 times. An excrept: ""It's a f*cked up world, it's a f*cked up place, everybody's judged by their f*cked up face..."" And that's pretty much it for 3 minutes and 50 seconds.Full Nelson: Another ridiculous song. Fred finally realizes what a loser he is (""Why's everybody always picking one me?"" he whines.) He then quickly becomes aggressive and boasts that he could beat anyone up.Rollin' (air raid vehicle): The only word that pops into my mind is...EMBARRASSING! First Fred Durst repeats ""Rollin', rollin', rollin',"" about ten times. Then he says proudly ""You can't mess with Limp Bizkit!""Save your money, folks!"
1,limp what?,"it sucks bad,but it says limp bizkit right on the front. consider that the warning lable. if you like raprock and don't worry about quility, this is a winner for loosers."
1,DON'T BUY THIS CRAP,"well read the title and you get the picture. if you want some GOOD raprock go get (hed) pe, broke the best raprock album in my opinion. also check out linkin park, taproot, and slaves on dope."
1,Limp Bizket,"Limp Bizket is worthless and nothing good to listen to. My ears bleed whenever I hear it. Its terrible, and its just a younger version of Linkin Park..but mostly RAP..Its garbage....Its pure stupid."
5,Go Limp Bizkit!,I just got this album but it's the best ever. I can't belive how good a job these guys did. Fred Durst and his boys did it again.This album is allot better then the first two. The tracks ''Rollin'' and ''My Generation'' are the best songs on the album. Buy this CD it's really good.
3,"I don't love it,but I DON'T HATE IT EITHER!","O.k,I'll admit this right now:Yes,i do own this record.Yes,i used to love this record and YES,i used to think they were the coolest thing around!Now i'm getting sick of them,but i don't understand why do you people hate them so much,i mean,sure,there are a lot of bands out there much better than Limp Bizkit(Nirvana,Led Zepellin,Rammstein just to name a few),but there also a lot of joke bands out there that make Limp Bizkit look like Queen Elizabeth (Alien Ant Farm,Anyone?????????)Ihonestly don't understand why there are so many ""good"" reviews!"
3,Okay,"I felt this CD was okay, but nothing spectacular. I was somewhat disappointed with the outcome. I thought Significant Other and Three Dollar Bill were much better, and contained really great songs. I hope that the next album they make is much better."
3,"good, But whoo way to much cusing!!",This cd has a lot of baaaaaaad languge but it has some good songs like rollin and my generation but still way to much cusing but hey what do u expect Christmas carols???? Thats what limp biskit is known for cusing!!!!!!
1,This CD is a complete waste of money,"I got this cd for free today and all I have to say is it's a complete waste of money. Don't buy it, it's the worst."
1,Limp Bizkit = Talentless waste of space in the music world,"I dont even have this album, nor do i want it. Judging from what ive haerd on the radio, it all sounds the same. Like garbage. It's pretty sad when a lead singer counts the number of times he's cursed in a song. Yeah what thats Fred for ya. Red hat on, foul mouth, baggy pants. He's not rock, he's a walking fashion statement. Flip records? what a joke, limp bizkit only got where they are today through Korn, who they turned on in the end. With bands like this, rock will be dead in a matter of years. And what a shame, bands like Alice in Chains, STP, Soundgarden, who paved the way into the 90s, have to turn on thier radio and listen to Fred cursing up a storm, while Wes BORING plays the same string over and over. Overall, good job Limp Bizkit, this is what u wanted right? Your names all over TV, money pooring in, forget the music. u cant even play anyway."
3,A few good songs + filler = Limp Bizkit,"It's been some time since I've got this cd, and I still hear Limp Bizkit's songs on the radio which reminds me of why I even bought it in the first place. Well, songs like rollin' and my way are good and catchy, but I think they ripped me off. The rest of the cd is mostly filler and different versions of their older stuff, esp 'outro'. What a waste of track space. I liked three dollar bill y'all and sig other much better. Mr. Durst, change is fine but stick with what you're good at. Appealing to MTV instead of focusing on the music has made me a little sick. Filler sucks."
1,"Don't blame me, I wanna help.....","Nothing could get worse than Limp's second album! Well, Suprise! This one is!!If you think this album is dope, wake up! Look around!There are plenty of better hardcore/rapcore albums out there!"
5,Limp Bizkit deserves a chance,"First of all, reading other people's reviews I find myself angry at the average rating this CD got. This is a really good album, consdering it came out just 18 months after Signicant Other. All of the songs are really catchy and rythmic (especially Rollin' and My Way) and Wes does a good job at maintaining heaviness having from switched from a 7-string to a 6-string.Overall, it's a brillant musical masterpiece and Limp Bizkit deserves more credit than they recieved."
2,THE END OF LIMP BIZKIT...,"Chocolate Starfish turn Limp Bizkit in one of the most famous bands in 2000... This was the end for Limp Bizkit... Fred Durst lyrics sometimes provides some interesting stuff, but most of what he sing is total crap! Ok, ALL THE RAPPERS got some lame and mediocre lyrics, so Fred's rap style obviously will provide bad rhymes... this last breath from Limp Bizkit got some good songs like MY GENERATION, LIVIN IT UP, MY WAY and the best limp song, the duet with Scott Weiland HOLD ON...BYE BYE FRED..."
3,Way to much swearing,"This has good guitar licks and straight out good music but I mean Fred Durst needs to learn how to write a lyric. He cant say a sentance without saying some swear word. He cant be creative. So if you like good music get it, but if you dont like cuss words in every sentence dont get it.Rollin, My way,Take a look around, boiler, my generation=only good songs"
3,"You think your special, you do?",There are few good songs on this disc with really good hooks that'll stick in your brain for a while.Basically if you like Kiddie Metal then you'll like this disc.
1,"slighty better, than the usual from limp bizkit","rate this 1.5 stars. My Way and Rollin'are improvements over prievious Limp Bizkit hits like Faith, and Nookie, but this band still blows."
5,...,"in This album fred totally struck gold. Songs like My Generation and Rollin' just make u want to crank up the volume. These songs are so electrifing and u NEVER get bored of any of them. Any Punk Rock fans out there who are thinking about getting it, DO NOT WASTE ANY TIME!"
1,Why God?!....Why???!!!,"Why is this so popular?. What is there to listen too?. If this is the way rock and roll is going, then it is dead and cannot be saved. Not that this is rock and roll, it's just plain incoherent noise. These guys get acclaim and sell millions of albums. Why?. What do they do?. You listen to the music and hear the same thing over and over again. This album is like one big long song. It is nothing that any untalented hack couldn't come up with. This is not creative or fresh. Nothing is going on with this tripe. How about we give acclaiim to people who actually sing and play instruments in a way that is actually intelligible?."
5,good good goooooooooooooooooooooooooodddddddddddddd,"wow this cd os awsome buy this cd all the songs except ""the one"" are phat man please buy this cd if you think fred durst is cool and your a BIG fan of l.b. you will love it like i do"
2,"Yeah, it's overrated. Most of it isn't great. But....","I bought this album the day it came out...Everyone has to admit that ""Rollin"" is catchy as heck, and it is a fun listen even though like all radio hits, it tends to get old. Really though, if you like heavy music ""Full Nelson"" is not a bad song at all. ""Boiler"" and ""The One"" are both good emotion driven songs....this CD is not all bad, and if you can get a bargin for it somehow buy it for those three songs."
1,What happened...?,"What happened to these guys? Their other albums were great. You can practically smell Fred Durst's arrogance. They went horribly down hill. They cant get it together. They sold out. You see them on TRL more that Britany Spears, and that is sad. They have sold out more than anyone. They used to be really cool, now theyre stupid. No wonder everyone suggest gay things n addition to this cd. That includes N'sync . I think its sad that Limp bizkit went from awsome to being in the same class as N'sync. All around this cd is horrible. I would have given it zero but they wouldnt let me. I cant belive it. Dont spend your hard earned money on a bunch of posers who wear their red caps backwards, pretend to be skaters, Try to hard to act like theyre young, went down the tubes..."
2,Whoz to blame?,I'm surprised that Limp Bizkit has gotten this bad.They were bad before and getting worse.Maybe something will come to them and they'll clean up their act before their next CD. (Hopefully)As for this CD if you Buy it be perpared to put it in the trash.
1,Come on! Honestly!,"I mean come on. Is this Rock or is this Backstreet Boys?This is such a painfully bad album that I have been prompted to set up a Fred Durst hate page. Not only is it an insult to everone who bought Dollar Bill Y'all, but it is an insult to rock in general. Besides Limp Bizkit becoming just as mainstream as Britney, the people who buy this album annoy me.You get all these 13 year old girls thinking they are excessively ql saying ""oh look, I've bought Limp Bizzzzkit.""It's not rock, it's not good and it belongs in a 9 year old's record collection, sandwiched in between 'NSYNC and Christina Aquilara.(I'm sure Fred Durst would enjoy that)Anyway, happy listening."
4,Good but could be better,"This CD has a few good songs on it (Rollin, Generation, MI2 theme) but it is not as good as the other two"
1,Lacks in musicality,"All this album does the whole way through is make noise behind obnoxious, high-pitched, swearing Fred Durst vocals. The only things that I can give this album is that it manages to keep a decent beat throughout, and the production of the MI2 theme song is alright. The blend of musical styles, not dissimilar to Linkin Park, completely and utterly fails in this album. I don't understand why artists think they can mix music genres such as metal, hip hop, rap, and electronica and think that they've produced a decent-sounding album. Such blends are terrible."
5,CREAT,"Yes alot of people hate fred durst. There are also alot of people who think he is an excellent muscian. I am one of them. They have changed there music alot from there first album. When Significant Other was release their music was more put together than thier previous album, but thier songs werent as serious as Korn's songs. Thier new one is a great achievment. They geat more serious with music that makes u want stand up a scream because this album is full of adrenaline. They also add some rap songs wich give it a nice glossy finish. This is a tight cd."
3,Average...,"I was expecting much more, but over all it's not a horrible album, but it's not amazing either. ""Rollin"" is probably the best, most energized track on the record; it really gets you in the mood to mosh. ""My Way"" is also an excellent, yet slower song. I don't understand why people hate ""Getcha groove on"" I think it's cool. Anyway.. many of the songs are pretty boring...like hot dog. What a horrible horrible waste of space. If you're a bizkit fan i guess you should check it out, otherwise go for their first album."
1,...,"...One thing that kind of got under my skin was when the Europen Geramies gave Fred Durst the Gramey for album of the year as if he had good writing abilities or some thing even close to that. Some of the very worst songs I have ever heard like Hot Dog, My Generation, both of the Rolling's' ect. are on here and to me thats reson enough to hate this album.(It all[stinks) In my mind Bizket has not released any thing any good at all scence ""Three Doller Bill Y'all"" in 1997.From what I've heard the latest Bizket CD ""New Old and Remixed"" is the groups very worst, but I am not going to waste mony seening if their wright or not."
1,worst album i`ve ever listened to,"This album is the greatest s*** i`ve ever listened to!!!!!!! Limp Bizkit totally became commercial! ""3 dollar bill y`all"" and ""Significant other"" was the best stuff made by Limp Bizkit!!! I nearly went to a concert of them in Austria, but I didn`t! Cause I don`t want to be with children under 14 in the crowd!!! So, for all those guys who bought this album and like it:Be happy with it!!!!!!!"
1,Sellout,"Success has gone to Fred Durst's head. Gone are the good ol' days of Three Dollar Bill, Y'All [EXPLICIT LYRICS]. Poser mainstream pop disguised as nu-metal, hidden behind a wall of foul lyrics and distorted guitars.What caused me to write this review is due to the dissing of a great band, Taproot, which has been heavily criticized by mainstream ""poser metal"" listeners who claim them to be clones of Limp Bizkit.This stuff is not unlistenable, however. Fred Durst's high pitched whine is rather amusing, and it's great at trashy parties full of ""badasses"" who think they're cool listening to Limp Bizkit.Disappointing for a band which used to write decent songs like ""Counterfeit""."
2,Limpbizkit is limp.,"This CD I wouldn't recommend. I like the group, but this CD only has about 4 good songs. I would say if you want the CD don't buy the double version. It just costs more and theirs no good songs on the second CD anyway. Out of all of Limps CD's I'd say this one is there 2nd worst one ever."
1,crap,"People must like to listen to diarrhea seep out of their buttrhole because that is about the same as this.Limp Bizkit never had talent and never will. Fred Durst thinks he is so hard core but you know he is a crybaby. If I ever get my hands on Durst I'll put his face on ebayEvery song they have is the same with terrible rapping vocals and the same swear word used consistantly. If you are going to swear in a song like that at least mean it. He has no feeling whatsoever.What it comes down to is, and I quote ""Limp Bizkit thinks they're black but they're just gay."""
1,How Can You Like This?,...The songs are horrible. The lyrics are [bad]. And the instruments are played by what sounds like amateurs. Don't waste your hard earned money on this CD...
4,hot!!!,"I have been waiting for a long time for this album and man it is one hot joint. Guest appearances by Papa Roach,Xzibit,DMX,Redman and Method Man make this an excellent piece. Rolling is the best cut in the album and yeah the remix is dope too. Personally I think Significant Other is a better album but nevertheless it is one album that I recommend to every Limp Bizkit fan."
2,the brothas done sold out,"i listened to 3 dollar bill. then i listened to significant other. then i listened to hotdog crap. i mean freal, listen to each cd and u can see that limp bizkit selling out. go listen to 3 dollar bill if u aint a friggen bandwaggon kid and try to find a song that says that im gonna be rollin rollin rollin. durst shoulda stuck w/the songs about relationships and how they suck. this cd is all about money, and tryin to give people what they want and not what they want themselves as artists. if u want some good bizkit, 3 dollar and signficant other(some of it neway) are ur best bets."
1,happy 40th birthday fred durst!! your a musical genius,"fred durst turned 40 yesterdayits funny becuase he makes music for all ageskids under 13 love fred , they look up to him as a fatheronly a genius could make music that appeals to young teens like me"
2,Dissapointed,"I usually Love Limp Bisket and all of their songs, but this cd was just a total waste of money and a major dissapointment. I was really hoing that it would be good, and maybe i set my standards too high, but i didn't like it at all. The only reason it got 2 stars is i love the song rollin, but that is the only decent song on the cd."
2,They can play..but who cares?,"Limp Bizket does nothing for me..in fact, I find myself slightly pissed off after listening to this cd( which was given to me by a friend who didnt want it anymore.)Fred Durst is a sexist and his angry/rap/metal thing is just boring....the band can obviously play their instruments but the nu-metal sound is just boring and repetitive and the lyrics are for the most part trash( ""play that f*cking track!"" ""You dont wana f**k with me today cuz a little something something didnt go your way"")If you want angry music than listen to some real punk rock and if you like the rap/rock sound then for the love of god listen to some old school chili peppers! Do yourself a favor!"
1,terrible,"What happened? Yes, I am another person who enjoyed thier first cd and thought they sucked after that. Limp Bizkit is a trend that nobody will remember in 5 years. The next generation of musicians will be laughing at Limp Bizkit. This cd is beyond bad. This cd compells me to hurl. If you wanna hear something good, go listen to deftones or glassjaw or system of a down. This is bad. But I don't expect to change anybodies opinion.. most people either love them or hate em.. ehh.. if you watch trl alot you will probably like this."
1,One of the worst records ever released!!!!,"Fred Durst and the rest of LB are very aggravating.Let's face it,they have a very minimal and rapidly fading fanbase.And as you all know,Fred Durst can't rap.Overall,if you want to waste your money on a piece of garbage,either buy this or the new record from Sev(the idiots from the Blue Pepsi commercial).Limp Bizkit SUCK!!!"
4,Cool,"It isnt as good as Significent Other but it still rocks.The rap tracks are great, and so are the rock tracks. Some of the tracks are to mellow and thats why it gets four stars."
1,What a mess,"Well, after their promising ""Significant Other"" release, you can officially categorize Limp Bizkit as musical trash. The songs all sound the same. The profanity is there because Fred thinks it makes him respectable. Guess what? It proves all the more that he is a immature whiner. His rage is cliched and the music behind it is loud and obnoxious. I think the best part of the album is when he tries to make fun of Nine Inch Nails. I guess Fred figured he was SOOOO far behind Trent Reznor, musically and lyrically that he had to fight back with petty insults. So if you're a 15 year old guy out there looking to get a rage-filled record that will make you ""cool"" or whatever, do yourself a favor and buy ""Rage Against the Machine"" and ""The Downward Spiral"" or ""Broken"" by NIN. Stay away from this if you can."
3,"Not as good as ""Significant Other""","I think this CD is good but not nearly as good as ""Significant Other."" The best songs are ""Rollin"", ""Getcha Groove on"", the ""MI2 Theme Song"", and ""My Generation."" The others are not all that great. I only suggest getting this CD if you are a avid Limp Bizkit fan."
3,So i't's not the greatest album ever...,"But so what? It's definitely not the worst either. This album can be enjoyable. Especially when you are 11 (or just don't give a fu*k about the lyrics) and need to have a lot of angry, catchy songs filled with a lot of curse words to rock out to."
4,Nice Compilation of New Jersey's Spirit!,"Joel Lewis, husband to Dr. Sandy Flitterman-Lewis who is the Author of To Desire Differently has compiled a wonderful anthology of New Jersey poets past and present in this book which I picked up at a bargain table at the Rutgers Bookstore. Anyway, the poets are various, Gay and straight, black and white, Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Atheist, etc., that put a different spin on living in the Garden State which is unfairly bashed with jokes. I recommend this book for anybody who wants a taste of New Jersey poetry and this book has a nice compilation of authors from various backgrounds and lifestyles and ethnicities."
2,These guns are not that great,"I wasn't overly impressed with these guns, though i wasn't really surprised either. I bought these guns for my sisters' birthdays. One of them was broken when it came, and the other broke after being fired like once. Oh well, what else can you expect when you expect when you buy $8.00 guns."
2,Wish I Could Still Retun It,"I loved this car for my son, who had a great time playing with it twice until the car died. I cannot figure out what happened because the batteries are brand new. From reading these reviews, I am assuming that it may have been left on and the 6 required batteries are now garbage. I have never come across a child's toy that doesn't have a power save mode. This car is poorly made and if I had saved the packaging, I would definitely bring it back. For now, it is just a push around toy...it's cute the way the remote fits into the car, but it's comepletely useless now."
3,Valuation Approach Overview,This book provides a good overview of how to value a private company in a merger or acquisition. It provides a solid guide on how to do a comprehensive private business valuation but glosses over the details within the various valuation methods.
5,Great book to help your pet relax,"This is a good book that explains where the muscles and inner workings of the cat are, and how to help them relax. A lot of times, my cat would be tense after a chase, and she and I would get on the bed and she would get a massage. She massaged me back with her claws (I call it kneading bread) to tell me how much she liked it, and her motor was going full speed (purring) so that told me I was doing something right. It takes a little experimentation to find out what you cat does and DOES NOT like. There's certain places, like her paws that she doesn't like, but I still try to get a little in, so it's not so hard to cut her nails."
3,Lincoln Welder,"This order was shipped as promised. The machine is all that I expected it to be. The only gripe that I have is that the hood was not part of the deal. I never recieved the Welders Hood that is in the picture of the deal. So for that little overlooked item of the deal I can not recommed this seller to anyone. Other reviews say that the hood is not the best and they went out and bought another one. That is fine, but they got the one that came with the deal, I didn't."
4,Fine 1st effort + cool b sides,"""It's always cold inside the Icehouse""....what a goose pimple experience if you hear the track ""Icehouse"". Also includes ""I' Can't Help Myself"" , ""Walls"", ""Sister"" + great b sides, the instrumental ""Paradise Lost"" + the pulse pounding ""not My Kind"". This would be Icehouse's 1st release, under the name 'Flowers', the name was changed due to another band having the same name at the time (gee what happended to that band??). While there are a couple of singles here, the album is meant to be heard as a whole, which is a dark, moody & ambiet release."
1,Control Factor,Truck dumpster go and stop until they jumped out from the window and fell behind truck's garbage then it go. How did they know that truck dumpster is going to stop and wait for them to jumped in?
2,"Buy their 2nd and 1st albums, and forget the rest","If you like the first three tracks on disc 1, then definitely check out their first two albums, 'For the Small Price of a Bicycle' and their self-titled album (in that order, i.m.o.). The songs on those albums are full of great couplets, and I'd rate each at 4 stars.After that, they evolved on to a harder sound, but somehow it didn't take on me. (For reference, I thought Understanding Jane marked their mediocrity's start. And if you don't like Birds Fly or Hollow Horse, then you probably won't like their first albums the way I do.)I haven't heard any of the songs on disc 2, and having owned a (different release of) disc 1, I'm not tempted to risk any more on their later work."
1,Unseasoned,"Lynn's book wasn't all that great. The plot was fine, as well as the theme, but it was poorly written and I have reread it several times, and it is still the same. It reflects a great image (that women can do anything), but the image is tarnished by poor writing techniques. Geraldine, the woman in the book, was my grandmother. I am sure Lynn is obviously a great and successful masonary, but writing is not an area of expertise for her. Just the first page alone made it hard to go through a chapter, nevertheless the whole book."
4,Should be Standard Equipment,"Definately needed if you are going to do any longer pieces. I am really surprised they are not included with the sander. The sander is great, and now that I have it I wonder why I waited so long to get one."
4,This should be standard equipment,I found these tables to be almost essential for my Jet 16-32 drum sander. They should be standard equipment with the machine and not an option. They were easy to install and I have had no problems keeping them flush with the platen belt. I highly recomend.
2,difficult to adjust,"This is an extremely important addition to the Performax 16-32 drum sander that doesn't compare to an otherwise well designed machine. The installation is relatively easy, two bolts on either side to mount the side brackets. The trick is to get the tables flat corresponding to the conveyor belt. After raising and lowering the tables and brackets several times I managed to get them close, but not where I wanted them, which is dead on. As a previous reviewer stated, they have a tendency to trail off (down) at the ends away from the machine, which makes them almost useless. Take it from a guy who has owned both the Performax and the Delta: you are still better off with the Performax. This item should be at least close right out of the box, and perfect with a few adjustments, but I'll have to settle for close."
3,How to Make Money From a Woodworker,"These are the most irritating part of buying a Performax 16-32 Drum Sander. First of all, they aren't included with the sander. One of those hidden gotcha's that you always run into with big power tools. Secondly, they are a &^%$! to align and keep aligned. I have no good advice here. You just keep trying until, suddenly, everything works. And third, they aren't as ridgid as something in this price range should be.The fourth irritating fact is that you really do need them. Without, you are always at risk of uneven or off level feed with anything larger than a chessboard. And nothing is worse than having your drum sander convert hours of painstaking work into sawdust. Avoid the expense at your own risk. I suppose you could build a stationary sanding table for the beast that would make these unnecessary, but if you are like me and whell things about this is the only option in town."
4,My 7-year old daugther LOVES them!,"My daugher wanted inline skates for her birthday, but in searching at numerous stores, I found nothing great. These are sturdy and a nice happy medium between the real ""Cheapos"" and the high-end K2s."
2,Huge and awkward,"I recently purchased a cheap little 6-outlet wall plug and I was hoping to find something similar online for another room in my house. That's when I came across this. I thought it would be a great idea for all those plugs that take up way too much room and block other outlets. Well...I'd rather they were blocking other plugs. This thing is huge and awkward. It sticks out from the wall so far that I can't put this behind my TV unit. It works nicely, but its size just doesn't work for my purposes. If you don't mind something the size of a kid's shoe sticking out of your wall, then go for this."
4,it works for what is intend for,"Is a really good product, it comes in a good packing. If you want to increase the number of plugs in a normal connector with out using a ""space taking"" regular extension cord. It looks good on a withe wall. Also the form of the plug helps you to plug many things even big chargers with od shapes. My only small dislike it is bigger than what looks like on the photos, so be sure of use it in a open not resticted plug."
5,Great Product,"As most apartments do, I only have 2 outlets in my bathroom and lots of things that need to be plugged in.This adapter is great because of the angles. My plug is right under my medicine cabinet, so having side and bottom jacks is great. I can open the cabinet without hitting something."
4,"Handy adaptor, works great in bathroom.","I've used this outlet for months and it really helped round up all the bathroom cords(beard trimmer charger, small undersink water heater, night light, etc. It fit just fine over the newly installed GFI plug, though if it ever did trip would have to remove the adaptor to reset the buttons, a bit inconvenient but only a minor problem. Really solved the problem of having several small electric devices and only one plug-in. Would be great if it was also a surge protector, but still great for tidying up cords and maximizing a small space."
1,"""GE"" Junk","GE TRANSFORMER-READY 6-OUTLET TAP, PN 50759. This multiple socket is not usable as received. Tolerances on the sockets are so far from standard that it will not accept the commercial 3-prong plug without excessive force. None of the sockets on the five units tested would seat a plug unless tapped with a hammer. Removal requires that the plug be levered from the socket with a blade -- - very hazardous if connected to power. It is noted that this device carries the GE trademark, but is manufactured in China under a license agreement with an Oklahoma company. There is no evidence of quality control inspection. Communication with the Oklahoma sponsor of this import (Josco Products)has been ignored. This product does not rate any stars, and is not recommended for purchase.Hap Gladish"
4,Solid Product,"The gloves are made out of a nice, thick, white cloth. I use them for changing light bulbs in fixtures where skin oil may make the bulbs burn out prematurely. The fit is alright. They are stitched together at the finger tips, and that always gets in the way of being able to use your finger tips in fine movements. If the fingers were smooth instead of having that lump of stitching, these gloves would be perfect."
1,Not the same product?,"I must have received a different pair of gloves than the previous 3 reviewers got. mine were in no way thick or soft; they were thin, without enough space for the webbing. They feel awful on, and I'm returning them.There was no manufacturer's name on mine btw, just ""Made In China"".Sadly, this is the second pair of gloves I've tried to buy on line because my local stores are all out. Both were shoddy goods. I'm just going to wait until they're back in stock at my small, dependable local druggists and try them on first there!"
3,Great if you want to fold Airplanes,"I'm not sure why you'd buy this book if you didn't want to fold airplanes!It's a great book, suitable for beginners, containing excellent airplanes to throw at your siblings and colleagues. The diagrams are easy to follow and everybody should be able to them"
1,Disappointed,"I bought this power supply to power a Viair 85p air compressor. When these items arrived I read all of the instructions provided for both devices and the compressor worked beautifully. The second time that I tried to use my compressor, the power supply would only tell me that there was a fault. Even though the instructions said that it would reset itself it never worked again. I returned the power supply and now use the compressor connected directly to my car battery and it works fine that way."
1,AVOID THIS BOOK AT ALL COSTS,"Simply terrible book. A reissue of the 1997 original but not updated at all. Even the foreward and introduction and global whiskey sales info is from 1997. Hopelessly, horribley out of date. Save your money. Don't even bother if it's free. There are so many other truely excellent books on whisky that you needn't bother with this waste of paper. Adds nothing to the genre."
4,a bitter sweet joy to read,"Ms. Brown remines the emotional landscape of Six of One, here the time period and characters are different but issues of humanity, gender and race (and how a small town deals with it) are discussed with humor, irony, wit and heart"
1,THIS IS NOT MUSIC,"Another reviewer wrote ""Jewel sings 62 songs in this album, and all of the tracks are excellent.""Uh, no. There are no songs on this ""spoken-word audio on CD."" It's just Jewel talking about her life. I didn't realize that before I ordered it but now it's being sent back. Sorry, Jewel is a great singer (which is why I bought what I thought was one of her music albums), but I don't really care to hear her talk about the farm she grew up on."
2,full of errors.,in studying for my exam. found so many errors in the book especially when it comes to numbers. be careful and best to double check against your own notes.
1,California Real Estate License Preparation,"This book needs major editing! I already have a Real Estate license in 2 other states, needless to say I was frustrated with the errors. I bought another program to prepare me for the California exam. Save your money."
4,Saved my fish.... but LOUD,"Purchased this in anticipation of power outages in Hurricane Irene. Our power was out for 3 days and I did not lose any fish or coral in my 14 gallon saltwater tank, including my beloved nem, thanks to this pump.HOWEVER... from 2 rooms away we couldn't hear the 75 mph winds over the noise from this pump. I don't know if it's louder than any others, but it is definitely dramatic!"
2,Cute concept ... but ...,"This movie begins with a cute idea: I've seen several fairy tale books rewritten for gay men but until I came across this title advertised on AMAZON, I had no idea the same concept had been tried with a movie.Unfortunately, I was VERY disappointed. There were no subtitles (a fact not mentioned on the AMAZON page offering the DVD) and the acting - one might call it pretentious softcore - was not good enough to keep me interested for more than a few minutes without subtitles.NEXT!"
1,Plastic junk,"The pump I received was COMPLETELY made of plastic. VERY CHEAP, made in china. I could tell this thing would break almost instantly so I returned it. It wasn't worth 5 bucks let alone more than 10, and the company wants me to eat the shipping and return shipping costs. Thanks for ripping me off!"
5,"Yep, Underrated","I wish this CD had been given its just due. It was one of the most sensual from El Debarge, so much that he asked God for forgiveness for being over the top in the liner notes. Love it!"
4,A welcome find when you sometimes need to use a large socket,"I was glad to find this item on Amazon.com's website. 1/4"" adaptors are so common but the sockets that use that drive only go up to about 1/2"". Using this you can go up almost if not to 7/8"" which can be useful. Heck one day my dad and I were working in the basement of our house and he didn't have a 1/4"" adapter handy so WE got out this one and went to work. WHen I saw this I bought two one for him and one for myself."
3,little loose with my socket set,"My 1/4 drive sockets hold and remove well enough, although removing has little more resistance than necessary. Sockets don't feel firmly sitted, but that may be from my sockets."
5,Excellent tool,"This item is fantastic when you are working with multiple bits, very easy to change them. I would have bought it in a set if it was offered."
2,Sequels are not as good as first parts,This is a pathetic carrie of the 90's. I don't know why horror movies of the 70's are comedy shows in the 90's. Carrie is no exception. The plot is not horror anymore. You'd better go back to the original movie.
2,So-so,"Me and two friends rented this last night and although we hadnt seen the first movie we thought The Rage looked quite good.It wasn't. In fact it was pants!The storyline was ok as far as horrors go but nothing happened until the end and even the ""horror"" bits weren't unexpected or sudden and were funny rather than scary!The very last bit in the film was freaky though and my friends screamed and i jumped and all of our hearts were racing for about a minute!"
4,Not a bad many years later sequel.,I also enjoyed the original Carrie with Sissy Spacek. Today's effects are obviously a lot better. If you want to see this movie to its fullest then watch the DVD version through a 5.1 DD surround system with a good subwoofer. The sound is really impressive starting in the opening of the movie and by all the black and white sequences along the way.
2,It's an outRage!,"I think the only reason this movie was made was to cash in on the new wave of teen horror, and make a few quick bucks. This movie was such a copy off the original; there were no new twists and the secondary characters were so one-sided and poorly developed. Even Rachel, the lead, wasn't believable as the class outcast. She's not even remotely ugly, she's actually quite attractive when she smiles occassionaly. Take my advice, stick to the original."
1,Urgh and Urgh again,"This movie was HORRIBLE. I hated it, Hated, Hated, Hated, Hated, Hated it... Hated it, every stupid line, every stupid scenerio, this movie had to offer. Every whimpering line absolutely was horrible. If you spend money on this movie, why don't you just take the money and burn it. Better yet, send it to Afganstan. Because the money your spending is well wasted. And if this movie is on DVD, then may god have mercy of the company's soul who made the DVD. Please, i beg you, DO NOT BUY THIS UTTER PIECE OF GARBAGE ACTING"
4,Great last disc.,"This is an awesome Replacements album and different from all the others. The songs seem lots more mature and adult compared to songs from the past like ""Customer"" or ""Run It"". This is mostly similar to ""Don't Tell a Soul"", but I think it's a lot better by a long shot. Paul is an amazing songwriter and musician. The first few songs are better then the later ones, merry go round to bent out of shape are the best of the album. Just buy this."
4,Loved it!!,"Of all the Dachshund books this is one of my favourite top ""3"". This is a book that I recommend to my puppy buyers to get."
4,Bagful of soul and jazz,"A strong set of standards and blues-soul tracks, adorned by the incomparable jazz-soul vocals of Diane Schuur and guttural blues inflections of BB King. King's molasses-thick tones contrast and complement Schuur's soaring scat-lines and soulful delivery, creating an edgy, hypnotic ambience which is best displayed on ""Try A Little Tenderness"", ""At Last"", ""No One Ever Tells You"" - and the album's highlight, the gospel fervour of Aretha Franklin's ""Spirit in the Dark"".Oh, and there's BB's subtle fret work to balance Phil Ramone's exuberant production. This is a superb collaboration by two disparate talents."
4,A marriage of opposites,"Here we have two of today's most distinctive voices in jazz, combining to create rapturous results. I like the way these two play off each other - sometimes alternating in playful one-upmanship, other times intertwining like vines curling up an old wall.The first track, ""No One Ever Tells You"" sets the tone, with its gently rocking rhythms and soaring vocals. The anthem ""Glory of Love"" inspires - as do many of the tracks - by being a little on the quiet side. I only wish these two great artists had explored more material like their gospel-inflected rendition of ""Spirit in the Dark."" When it arrives, later in the program, its energy is so welcome that I wanted two or three more like it. But it's a minor complaint in a recording that has given me great pleasure."
1,I did not like this combo at all.......,"I did not like the combo of Dianne Schuur and BB King at all. I am a big fan of both, but I found this CD to be off the mark completely."
2,Plink,"It is more of a deodorizer than a cleaner. It worked well as a deodorizer but I wanted something to clean my disposal, so I was disappointed."
3,"Kills odor, partially","The instructions were easy enough. Just run your disposal with full running hot water for about a minute to clear, slow stream to a pencil length, drop Plink in disposal. Run with slow stream water for 15 seconds and VIOLA! Your disposal is not smelling nasty.The caveat, you have to do it fairly frequently if you use your disposal daily. I don't know if it's cleaning my disposal. All I know is that the disgusting smell is replaced by yummy lemons."
2,School project?,This film is so amateuristic it must have been a film school project. The acting is so bad the producer must have given parts to his buddies instead of to qualified actors. The woman on the cover is nowhere to be found in this film.
5,Works well!,Works well; haven't had any issues with it!! Airs up the tires every time. Price was very good compared to others.
2,its plug will pop up,"Although it is cheap, the quality is too poor for its price!I used it for 2 or 3 times, and the plug start to pop-up. I have to hold the plug with one hand and pump with another hand."
1,AWFUL! Worst book I've ever puchased,"This 10 page board book has no information about how a normal human eye works. It contains only labels of 4 parts of the human eye. The rest of the book is single line descriptions of 4 vision problems. That's ALL that's in this book. This might be appropriate for eye doctors to give out to young patients who need to learn something about the 4 specific vision problems covered in this book (Glaucoma, Macular Degeneration, Cataract, and Diabetic Retinopathy), but it would probably be inadequate for that since there is only one line about each. The first page also does have one-line descriptions of Myopia, Hyperopia, and corrective lenses for these. This is probably the best page of the 10 in the book (when they say '12 pages' in the description, they are including the front and back covers)."
5,A must have,I am so glad I bought this item. It makes driving screws so much faster and easier. I am going to buy an extra one soon just in case I wear this one out.
2,great tool poor quality,"I've owned several of these over the years and they just keep breaking and wearing out. It is a must have tool, but I'm looking for someone to sell me one that wont wear out so quick. Maybe one with a thicker shell. They burn out especially quick on self tapping screws that slowly scrape away at the outer shell when you are driving them. I've always used dewalt drive guides but I'm going to try some other brands now."
2,different color,When this arrived it was black instead of orange - good news is that I actually prefer the black and would not return it - just not the same color as described.
2,They're still sending the wrong cord!,"This is interesting because amazon rejected my last review on this item for length possibly. very odd!I know GE doesn't actually make extension cords, they license their name to smaller companies that import for as cheap as possible. Thats why things like the wrong cord being shipped happen. I suggest buy from reputable cord manufacturers and stick with GE for light bulbs:Coleman Cable 02307 16/3 Outdoor Extension Cord, Orange, 25-FootUS Wire 65025 12/3 SJTW Orange Heavy Duty Extension Cord, 25-FootWoods 267 16/3 SJTW General Purpose Extension Cord, Orange, 25-Foot"
2,It is NOT orange,"Just like everyone else has said, ""This product is not orange"" as described by the seller. There is nothing wrong with it and it appears to be of adequate quality. I give it a low rating due to erroneous description."
5,Best Table Saw Ever,"We got this saw two-years ago in my shop class. We have run everything that you can imagine through it, even pvc. No matter what you run through it, it doesn't slow down. The stock-splitter/Anti-kickback teeth are a great feature to insure that you don't end-up with a board in your stomach. It is a left-tilt saw so that your material doesn't bind against the fence. The Accu-Fence is one of the best fences that I have ever used. It is smooth, and insures accuracy. When you set up the fence, Make sure that you set fence tape right, so that you wont have to ever have to use a ruler. This saw is awesome, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to make a quality investment. Out of five stars, I give this saw ten."
5,Something Different This Way Comes...,"This album is extremely unique. A blend of explicit lyrics, break beats and actual harmony. Even if you don't care for the subject matter, the groove itself will keep you listening.Outstanding."
3,"Nice trumpet, bad paint job",Cecilio Blue Lacquer B Flat Trumpet with Hard Shell Carrying CaseNice trumpet but the finish peels after handling it had it for about 2 weeks now and the paint is coming off. The finish isn't all that great but it plays well. Stick to non colored instruments and you might get better results.
2,Dated Melodrama,"Madigan was a critical success at the time (late 60's). It was not a box office success. It has the look and feel of another Don Siegel movie ( ""The Killers"". Meant to be a TV Movie. Madigan even continued as a series of TV Movies). Over time it has not aged all that well. The Don Costa score is way overblown and very dated. It was considered to be gritty and realistic at the time. After not having seen it for about 30 years, it came as quite a shock to see that it now plays like a parody of the era. The print however is in great condition."
4,Fine Homebuilding Reprints,"This is typical Susanka style, but looking at individual details, and helping to solve specific problems.Definitely a good book, but if you subscribe to Fine Homebuilding, you'll find that you've already read this."
4,Great Guide for Remodelers,"This book will be invaluable for anyone looking to build/remodel their home. The author provides creative suggestions for rethinking how we live and ways to reconfigure existing space rather than construct extensive (and expensive) additions to our homes. Susanka admirably supports her ideas with background information, diagrams and case studies. Ultimately, however, few ideas in the book are applicable to anyone not planning a large scale construction project of some kind. If you're interested in what you can do with your existing small space, check out one of the author's other books instead."
1,great songs ruined,"Had i known upon buying the CD that Rosie O'Donnell SANG ALONG with every musician, I would have left this on the shelf. There's a reason Rosie O'Donnell is an actress and talk show host, SHE CAN'T SING. For the most part, the songs were the same old Christmas shtick, but once I hit ""I'm Gonna E-mail Santa"" it was either hit eject or puncture my eardrums with sharp objects."
2,I just don't get it!,"I bought this album after reading all these great reviews. This album is only fair at best. I agree with the other reviewer that said ""Christmas With The Family"" ruins the album. It should be called ""Christmas With the Disfunctional White Trash Family"". It is kind of funny but definitely not rated PG. You won't want the little ones singing along with this chorus. Rosie should not sing on any of the songs unless she is inaudible. I hate to slam a charity album but I didn't like this very much and my wife and the other moms hated it."
1,:(,"Patrick Flynn felt he had no other choice but to rescue the runaway bride. Abandoning his undercover operation, officer Flynn helped the woman onto the back of his motorcycle and took off. Unknown to Patrick that he was rescuing the one and only Dixie Davis the Broadway bombshell that was supposed to be marrying a notorious mobster. Later when he learns the truth, Dixie hires him to be her bodyguard. Flynn figures this is the perfect opportunity for the police department to gain information on her mobster ex-boyfriend. Dixie is one lively character and that leads to an entertaining read. I must admit that I was disappointed by the end of the book. What we learn about Dixie at the end does not fit the character portrayed throughout the story. This was the first book that I have read by Nancy Martin and I must admit that I was pretty disappointed."
2,Very hard to read,I found a free copy but this is impossible to read and so I gave up and now will reaqd a Tudor book with pictures
4,Adolescent Leonard blooming into maturity.,"After having read Elmore Leonard steadily since I discovered his name in a currently out-of-print collection of pulp stories, I've been a diehard fan. Stick is a chance for the Leonard fan aquainted with his later works-turned-movies (Get Shorty, Out of Sight, Maximum Bob) to watch the genisus of pure genius. The book has several twists that show up, in form, in some of Leonard's later novels, and Ernest Stickley, Jr. seems more like a blue collar worker than an ex-con trying to make a go at it. None of this subtracts from the novel's genuine story; the bad guys are anything but simple and two-dimensional, and the overall undercurrent throughout the book is one of anticipation. Much as I hate to say it, Tarantino has nothing on this kind of stuff."
2,boring...,"Ferrill is a great historian, but in this book he failed miserably in holding the reader's attention."
3,"Good Music, but a bit disappointing","I was expecting a wonderful voice, which she has, yet the words were often unclear and the music louder than Miss Church's voice at times. I enjoyed some of the songs on this CD, and as this is my first CD of hers, I am not sure I want to own others. It was a nice CD, but there are alot of others I preferred more. I think I was expecting more than I got."
2,"Older, but not better . . .","Last year during my frantic effort to get into the Christmas spirit, I bought ""Voice of an Angel"" and thoroughly enjoyed it, despite agreeing with those who felt Miss Church's voice was not yet up to the exposure she was already getting. I was charmed. When I learned there was a new CD, I didn't hesitate. I wish I had. This collection of mostly familiar Christmas carols brings nothing whatsoever new to the genre, and I'm certain there are far better recordings of each and every song. Remarkably, her voice seems to have diminished, rather than grown."
3,There are times when she strains to hit the top notes.,Charlotte has a wonderful voice and the songs are quite nice.I think a change in octave would allow her to better use her skills and talents.
5,"Got It for Christmas, Just Doin' the Review",Easily the Christmas CD of the last two years. Rack this up with a Jewel Christmas Cd and the Holiday is taken care of.
3,Fairly well done but....,"I feel that it's being pushed too far. I personally like Charlotte and her DVD was amazing but her voice sounds very tired and strained. Oh, well. People always make mistakes with holiday albums. I bet she'll do better next time."
5,Gorgeous!,"Charlotte Church has done it again! She is extremely talented. Even if she was 25 when she put this out, she'd be amazing. But she was only 14-15 years old when she recorded this! Beautiful. This album has great choral accompaniments and fabulous orchestra arrangements. It is a little on the high side in certain songs, but it still sounds amazing. I love her voice."
3,"Well, I liked *most* of it....","1) Re-record ""Elysium"" sans Billy Gilman. If she must do it as a duet, try Lea Solanga.2) No-can-do on ""The Christmas Song""-thing. I've been listening to Nat ""King"" Cole sing it for too long.3) Arrangements are all mediocre. O Holy Night should have been done a capella.I'm a little disappointed in this one, but the rest of her recordings are still top notch. She is fabulous on the ""Beautiful Mind"" soundtrack. I hope she does anotherChristmas album evenutually. I really *do* want to hear ""Elysium"" without Billy."
1,Garbage Plastic Bracket,This item is a replacement for one I have had for approximately 7 yrs. It looks identical except for the garbage plastic bracket. It looks like solid metal but.......when I put the handle into the bracket it promptly broke and is not reparable. Fortunately I was able to 'dumpster dive' into my recycle bin and retrieve my original metal bracket. Shame on the manufacturer!
4,"Good, but...","The shower head is pretty small and the massaging setting is kinda weak, compared to my old one, but the trade-off is it really works. My water felt soft and clean and my hair was really soft and skin felt like I had put lotion on after taking one shower with this, so the filter does a great job. I live in Phoenix, where the water is horrible and very hard. So I'm really hoping this helps. Plus all that Chlorine in your shower/bath water is not good for you. One other thing, it did not seem to fit in the holder tight, so I used the one I had from my previous shower massager."
3,"Good filtration, but hose rusts quickly","This is a good shower filter, light weight and a nice range of massage options. I have owned and replaced a number of them over the years. The problem is that after about six months, the hose which connects the unit to the wall and the shower head, which is about 5 feet in length, rusts terribly and looks unsightly. What's more, it has discolored the white tiles it touches in my shower, which is difficult to remove. Why doesn't the manufacturer simply include a plastic fitting to cover the length of the hose from the get-go, preserving the life of the metal material? That oversight and the fact that a rustproof exterior isn't part of the design keeps me from giving a full five star review."
3,Only contains one episode,"If you're reading this, you already know that 321 Penguins is produced by the Veggietales folks, and you probably already know that 321 Penguins is good but not as good as Veggietales. There's only one episode on the DVD, and it only runs about 30 minutes. The ""60 minutes"" runtime listed in the product description must include the bonus features. If you have a preschooler who likes to watch the same DVD over and over (and over and over and over...) you might want to look for something that lasts a little longer. Minus one star for story, minus another star for value."
2,A Dumb Book,"I think the book of ""If You Give A Pig A Pancake,"" is really dumb because it really doesn't make any since. I mean really if you think about it you would not give a pig a pancake in the first place. I think this is a stupid book for little kids to read. I think the only thing that is good about this book is the illustrations. I think they are so cute."
3,A formulaic sequel,"Following in the footsteps of the hugely popularIf You Give a Mouse a CookieandIf You Give a Moose a Muffin, this 1998 entry feels a little weak.The ADHD-afflicted animal (a pig, in this case) is cute enough, but some of the transitions get a little reach-y even for this series, like building a tree house when they were on their way to the mailbox. There's also less animal-child cooperation here than in the Moose book.I would not recommend this title, unless you are looking to complete the series.For an out-of-the-sty porcine suggestion, have a look atThe True Story of the Three Little Pigs."
5,Pigs and Pancakes Rule!!,"I bought this book as a gift for my sister and her new son, but I loved it so much, I ended up buying a second copy. The illustrations are wonderful and complement the story perfectly. Whenever I feel a little blue, I pull it off the bookshelf and read it again."
3,If You Give A Pig A Pancake,This book was very interesting. I know that a pig would probably like the pankcake. The pig tried to show off because he was hyper. I would be exhausted after chasing that pig. I ope that I never see a pig like that one.
2,A TV pilot not a movie...,Being a long time fan of the books I made sure I caught this when it first aired on the SciFi channel some years back. Although not on par with the books I thought it would make an interesting series.But as expected the same idiots who cancelled Farscape decided not to give this a chance.The bottom line is that since this was intended as a series pilot it doesn't really have a middle or end just a beginning. So unless someone decided to foot the bill for production of more episodes you are left with the first chapter of a story that will never have a second.
1,Worst thing ever made by the SF Channel!,This show sucks. I am dumber for having watched it. I loved the entire series as written by Farmer but this version is a joke. If you ever intend to read the series don't watch this show.
4,Go Gregor Go!!!,"Ewan McGregor proves in this movie as Nick, he is a good actor...nicely done with some memorable moments....dont let this happen to you..if you work in the stock market....and note that an actor named Alexis Denisof plays in this movie...he goes on to play Wesley Wyndham Price in Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Angel..for all you fans who didnt know he was in this movie..check it out..he has a nice role."
5,washboards,"Washboards will be great for both of my daughters who have children playing sports; softball, baseball, football. delivery was really fast. I have had a washboard for years; used when my daughters were in sports. I knew this would be a wonderful purchase for my girls."
3,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this book. It is written by a PhD and has good reviews, but it seemed to be written for about an 11th-grade reading level/comprehension. The advice was not very sophisticated or surprising to me. Just another self-help book that promises the world and delivers little."
4,Great music but beware the marketing ploy,"Strong melodies delivered by pan flutes and traditonal flutes. Many of these tracks also show up on the compilation CDs from Earthtone. Justifiably so, but beware! This CD was reissued in 1999 under new artwork, title (""Ring of Gold""), and sequence of tracks. My rating of 4 means I like the album, still listen to it and recommend a purchase."
4,Gets the job done,"Barbecue is good but controlling the heat from charcoals can be tricky. I've been trying to master the art for years, and with this product it makes it a lot easier to indirectly cook larger portions of meat. Also helps to controll the range of cooking you desire, on one side of the grill you can have less charcoal burning for things like hot dogs, and thinner portions of meat, that don't require intense heat, and on the other end you can put more charcoals for things like chicken breasts and steak. Has a suffiecient capacity but could hold more and is why I gave it 4 stars. Other than that I love the fuel holders it makes placement and clean-up of charcoal a breeze and it gets the job done."
4,Weber Charcoal Fuel Holders,"If you own a Weber grill and plan on cooking anything that requires indirect heat, you need this product."
4,Vanessa Bell Armstrong's baby sis!,"Make no mistake -- Margaret can SANG. Not only that, the material and production on this album are extremely good.I hope she decides to record another solo album in the near future, because this is a fine collection of urban contemporary music, circa 1991 (and it really doesn't sound that dated, either). Good job, Margaret...hope to hear from you again, and soon."
3,Here With You,"A great love song. It relates to a lover or to the greatest love of all, Jesus. Wonderful for a wedding."
3,"great product, bad expiration date","this is a fantastic product - tasty and healthy. an excellent alternative for people who like ""wheat thin"" type crackers.the crackers arrived aok, however i was EXTREMELY disappointed to find out that the suggested use by date on the package was november of 2006 (just 3 months after i purchased the product). we love the crackers, but certainly don't go through a box/week!! i'm sure they are fine to eat past the expiration, but i would NOT have made this purchase if i knew that i was buying nearly expired merchandise."
4,Fantastic Album,Terrific album anda serious tease. I can't believe these guys haven't dropped another one in 4 years. Driving me nuts!
2,"Too much ""prose"", not enough story","I generally love ""coming of age"" stories. The problem with this one is I had a hard time trying to find the story through all the contrived language that I assume the author intended to be deep and full of profound insight. Toward the end of the book, the story's young protagonist proclaims: ""I tried to sound mysterious.""Too bad the author did, too."
3,"Good idea, not so good outcome, but still cute.","I wanted a doll that could do it all, i.e. get dirty and take a bath--I'm surprised there don't seem to be many that can (this was the 1st I saw that could & I was in a hurry :( ) The wiggly water effect is a nice idea and kind of works, but the doll is rather heavy when full of water--TOO heavy for my 18 month old. But she can and does love to play with this doll when its empty. The other big problem is that this doll can only lay down or I guess stand leaning against something. If you don't fill it with water and leave the plug open so air can flow in and out then you can kind of make it sit if you squish some air out, but eventually, it will fill with air again... All in all, it's just a doll, not really a ""baby doll"" in the pretend mothering sense of the word."
4,Nice filter,"I've been looking for a replacement HEPA filter for my Sunbeam air purifier for years. This one works fine. It does not fit as snug as the original filter, but it does the job."
2,If you think really hard.... you might get one of the jokes!,"I saw the cover of this book, and thought it would be a funny addition. I coulden't wait to get it, and laugh my socks off. Once again.. Don't judge a book by it's cover. She has a few funny art clips, but nothing great. I found the book to be more of a put down, than funny. The book is black an white. Not color like the cover. It has 111 pages, and maybe a little cute art. Not a book I would recommend. Why bother wasting your time?"
3,Handy but slow...,"This is handy to have, but it loads the pictures to my computer fairly slow, compared to other methods."
5,Glad I found it!,"I have an Olympus Camedia Camera that uses Smart media cards. I recently bought a new computer, but it does not have a card reader slot for the Smart Media card like my old computer did. I could use the cable that came with the camera and plug it into a USB port if I can find it. I investigated why this slot was missing on the new computer, and found that Smart Media is no longer available. I love my camera and do not plan to upgrade anytime soon, so this product saved my life! Works great, love it."
5,Peace,"I was looking for relaxing music. What I found was Peace. My breathing slowed and I was enfolded into the music and its echos. This won't put you to sleep - but it will leave you with a sense of stillness, calm and inner peace. Really."
4,art and sport,best of fast. Flying man with his strat. let's play it faster. In his music there are more than art and notes.There are long and invisible fingers just having an amazing and unbelievable sound from well known instrument.
2,"a product from the ""music circus"" days ...","Chris had the most ridiculous hairdo and the speediest hands of all times and that's about it. Of course this and being dressed like half medieval half clown was part of the scene in those days. I call them the ""music circus"" (also Hair Band) days and they go from about 1984 on to the beginning of the nineties when grunge became the fashion. A lot of the music made during that period didn't stand the test of time because it takes a lot more than acrobat techniques and flashy outfits to make good music. This record is for speedsolo-freaks and Graham Bonnet-fans only, not for those looking for a catchy soul-moving metal classic."
4,THANKS AMAZON.COM,"I love this parfum and used it since 10 years ago, but unfortunately in my country this parfum has been discontinued, so i was searching on AMAZON.com and i saw it there, i ordered it and when i received it, i was so happy. I used it, and it stays on my body the whole day, so i cannot complain about anything, I just need to say THANK YOU amazon for having it on your site."
5,Simply brilliant,"Joe, and this CD are simply brilliant. But we don't believe in Dale De Vere for a minute!"
4,Night & Day II,"As a long time of JJ, I found N&D II to be an extension of the original while weaving in some of more current orchestral work. This can be heard with the piano signature of ""Steppin' Out"" on a couple of tracks and the string quartet work throughout the CD.If you are looking for loud screaming guitars, forget this CD. Like the original, there are no guitars, except Graham Maby's bass. The strings and piano take their place. There are several upbeat tracks, but overall the CD is pretty mellow.There are three guest vocalists on the CD. I still haven't decided if they help or hinder N&D II. I am presently surprised that JJ's vocals haven't deteriorated over the years; in fact he has grown as a vocalist. This is one reason I was taken aback by three out of the ten tracks to be sung by someone other than JJ.Overall, I really like the new CD and would highly recommend it to old and new listeners."
2,The differences between Night and Day and Night and Day II are day and night,"Jackson makes a play at mainstream attention again with this contrived sequel, imitating predecessor's high-minded and eclectic pop sensibilities, though loosing much of the soul which inhabited the original and appearing all the more pretentious for it- hearing Stepping Out ""themed"" not once but twice throughout is disheartening enough."
5,Malibu,"I thought that the book was ""outstanding"" Particulary liked the history part and the progression of Malibu over the years."
1,I dread dealing with people who have read this book!,"This book has too many mistakes, period. Sure, the author gets it right most of the time, but a B minus is not good enough for this type of book. Why? There is always some self-styled grammarian lurking about, ready to correct your English during a conversation. It's rude to do so, of course, and it's annoying enough when the person doing the correcting is right, but it's doubly annoying when the person offering to ""educate"" you is wrong.This book is going to give a lot of these jackasses a false sense of legitimacy. Get ready."
5,Simply put: Amazing!,"I cannot really put into words how amazing this CD is. Everyone I've played it for has fallen in love with it, and so have I. There is just something about the vocals and the music that is truly mesmerizing. This family(and their best friend) is truly talented to be able to put an album like this together. One word that immediately comes to my head when I think of Eisley is ""whimsical."" There is just this innocence and nostalgic value to every song on here. Stand out tracks include ""Marvelous Things"", ""Plenty of Paper"", and my personal favorite ""Lost At Sea."" I've never heard anything like this. It's so original and wonderful, this hasn't left my CD player in days, and I'm sure it'll stay there for a lot longer. I highly reccomend this CD to anyone. Eisley is someone to look out for, and I can't wait to hear more from them."
2,"CD's Good, But...","""Room Noises"" (and all their other EPs, for that matter) makes Eisley sound fine, but have you seen the live clip on their website? They sound horrible live. I hate it when I get so excited about a band and then they turn out to sound not-so-great live and have perfect production on the record that makes them sound lovely. Needless to say, I don't like Eisley anymore and haven't listened to them for a while. Please, don't listen to this crap."
2,Basically No Talent...,"So many of these reviews comment on the band's original lyrics. Well, guess what? I'd rather listen to a talented band or singer with bland, trite lyrics than listen to an untalented band or singer with original, unique lyrics."
2,Over produced!,"I heard about this band a while back, and I love the original version of ""I Wasn't Prepared."" The new version is the typical record company overproduction that ruins good music. It even includes some lame orchestral background, which is needless for such a great song originally. That's just me though!"
5,highly recommended,"beautiful. that's all i have to say about this album. eisley is unique and one of my favorite bands. hope you buy this album if you are not sure. you will L-O-V-E it! trust me. =]p.s. did you know they toured with Coldplay? So for all you Coldplay fans, check out Eisley, you'll love them!"
4,halley s bible handbook,"i like it quite a lot so far ,i hadnt had the chance to finnish it yet,it ll take a while ,i think is very informative and has a lot of detailes and historicalinfo data,i recomand this for anybody that desire to go deaper in to the Word of God!"
2,after all the hype...,"i could only read an hour of this. maybe i should have treated this as a reference guide. dry, boring, long."
2,Buy only if cheap,"I just bought this hibachi for $4 and assembled it. It's my first time switching from a Webber, but I wanted something small for personal use so I don't have to fire up the big grill. At $4, it's a great deal, although it seems a little flimsy. If all goes well, I'll likely upgrade to something more substantial, like a castiron hibachi. Don't pay over $10 total (shipping included) for this thing."
2,how to overcook a cake...,"The originals of these songs were great, but they've been remixed in a tacky late 80s style so that they now sound completely dated. Mesopotamia was too well-produced to suffer the indignity of being remixed to the consistency of gruel. Seek out the original pressings."
4,turned out interesting,"I had to read this book as a requirement for my 10th grade summer reading. I wasn't sure if I was going to like it. I did enjoy reading it and I didn't think this would be ""my type"", but it turned out intriging. For some reason I was interested in it and I encourage others to give it a try. A well-written book."
5,praise to willa cather,"WOW! What a great book! The essence of pioneer life was captured perfectly in this book. May Ms. Cather be awarded with writing one of the books that has changed me the most thus far. For my freshman english class we had to ""sell"" a book. I could not have pick a better read! Many of my friends told of its monotonous and slow plot. I couldn't disagree with them more. Though not a cliff hanger or adventurous it had an amazing simplicity that made it beautiful. As Antonia is once described to change one and leave an ever lasting immpression, so does the book leave this too. This is truley a piece of great literature."
5,Enriched version helpful,"This edition was quite helpful to read before leading a book discussion group. The glossary, notes and suggestions for discussion did enrich the experience for high school students reading the Cather novel. This book is a good value. Note: Cather fans should check out the University of Nebraska archives of her letters and photos to further enrich their experience."
3,Kindle Version,"I like it, but I don't love it. I started reading it and really enjoyed it when the story was being told on the farm. As soon as they move to the city, however, the pace begins to slow and it starts to focus on petty, smaller things, so it became less enjoyable for me. I haven't finished it yet, so I can't give a final word on it."
3,Helps to have prairie knowledge,"I read this book aloud to my mother. The dialogue was not as strong as many other novels. The descriptions of scenes and activities were often in colloquial language, and I do not know enough about early 20th Century prairie life to fully understand what was presented. This might be a great read for someone familiar with farm life."
2,I've only read 220 pages of this book but...Yuck!,"I love to write and I love to read. But there's only so much I can read about the open prarie and immigrants as presented in this book. ""Sign of the Beaver"" that I read in 5th grade was much more interesting than this so far. I hope my opinion changes."
4,Quality product - terrible & slow delivery time,This item was ordered on 07/13/09....expedited order...finally received book August 1. With that type of dellivery time will not buy any more books here.
4,Excellent supplementary material,"The writing is art. This a classic, so anything I want to say has already been said, and probably with more eloquence. I do want to recommend this edition of the book for its excellent supplementary material: biography, historical timeline, discussion questions, and detailed notes."
4,An Early Feminist Novel,I have read this book three times. The first time was 40 years ago. The second time was in my forties. I couldn't believe all the ideas I saw in the story that I didn't see when I was 12 years old. The women characters are very strong and described beautifully. The story is touching and Willa Cather describes the landscape vividly. Now almost ten years later I read the story for the third time for my book discussion group. All of them loved it. There is alot to discuss.
5,I loved it!,"I am a Junior attending the Lowell Whiteman School and this book was required reading for this year. I had to read the Scarlet Letter, Red Badge of Courage, and others and I must say that this book stood out from all of the other books. I enjoyed reading this book so much that it didn't seem to be a chore to read it for me. Cather does an incredable job of using Antonia as a symbol through out the novel. She also seems to be elaborating on the Latin saying, ""Optima dies...prima fugit."" In the mortal world, the best days are the first to flee."
2,Major flaw from narrator,"I had to stop listening to this recording, as the narrator consistently mispronouces ""Antonia."" He accents the 3rd syllable rather than the 1st syllable. Willa Cather even tells how the name should be pronounced in one of the early chapters (Chapter 3 I believe?). The Bohemian name ""Antonia"" places the accent on the first syllable, like the way we pronounce ""Anthony"" in English.So I'll actually read the book instead of listening to it, as I've heard raves about it."
2,"Well written, but not worth the time.","I had to read this book for my English class in my senior year. I can't belive i read the whole thing. Its a very slow, almost love story, with almost no plot at all. It is, however, very well written. Cather uses good words and expression in describing every character and ever situation, but that isn't neraly enough to make this an interesting book. Nice try, but not good enough."
4,Love's Lesson,"My Antonia was a touching book. Deep down inside it meant to tell readers not to let the one that you truly love go, no matter what. Jim didn't fallow this and ended up with a life of only thoughts of ""his Antonia"", and a longing to have her as a part of his everday life and not just his everday thoughts. This book tells us to keep the ones that are dear to us and have taught us the most about anything close to us. Not just close in our hearts but also close to us physically, so that we may enjoy thier presence in our lives. Jim and Antonia are in love with each other and yet they refuse to just give into the feelings that they have for one another. Because of this they lose out on an experience that may have been the greatest love of thier lives. This book tries to teach its readers an amazing lesson about the importance and power of love."
3,Inspiration to women,"Willa Cather's ""My Antonia"" is a book of strife and hardship. The strong willed main character is Antonia Shimerda who despite her numerous opsticles always manages to land on her feet. Her life is hard from the beginning, when she lives in the pathetic excuse of a house and deals with working as a man in the fields. She gives an inspiration to women because of how strong she stays throughout the book. However, the book does drag and soem of the parts are a little dull. Overall, not a bad book and I would recommend it to anyone who likes books with a slow developed plot."
1,Has good intentions...but fails,"""My Antonia"" takes place during the mid 1800s on the Nebraska prarie and tells the story of the ever-changing relationship between Bohemian immigrant girl Antonia Shimerda and Jim (the books narrator).I was very dissapointed in the book. Willa Cather has good intentions trying to depict the landscape down to every last detail, but end up making her charming story hard to follow. I lost interest in the book qucikly. I also found it very dissapointing that Antonia does not play a more important role in the story... the main focus is on Jim about halfway through the book. Antonia is a far more interesting and complex character than Jim, and is more fun to read about. All things considered,it is not worth your time and effort to finish. However, if you are a huge history fan or are into westward expansion, you may enjoy ""My Antonia"" more than I did."
1,World's most boring book,"I'm sorry I did not like this book at all. I do have to admit that the some of the discriptions were pretty good, but the book has no plot. This is one of these books that I wish I would have acted like I read, as I did with a few other books we had to read. So I only found one interesting part in the whole book and that was the wolve story with Peter and Pavel and that was it. I feel asleep reading it, and during class could barely keep my eyes open because it is like reading a text book, or a report on something. So reading it for most teenagers like myself is more like a tourture, a good idea for a punishment."
1,I couldn't finish it,I had the audio version of this book...I couldn't get past disc one. It was truly horrible. I think it was the narrator and maybe not the material.Do not get the audiobook of this...
3,Professional Deluxe Ranger: Overhead Pulley System,"This pulley exercise system is to treat my damaged shoulder - rotator cuff. It allows me to keep my range of motion as wide as possible. It works well. However, for what it is - 2 pieces of dowel, a plastic pulley, a few feet of thin rope, a strap to hang over the door - it is probably worth $3.00, not $12.89. If I had known what it was like, It would have been quite simple to make my own."
3,It does what it's designed to do,"I looked over several product options, and thought ""I'm just going to be using this for a couple of months after surgery to limber up the shoulders."" It worked. The item a physical therapist had me use was commercial grade, solid grips and metal pulley wheel. On this product, nothing was really lost in terms of function and benefit. I had my doubts about the plastic pulley wheel and hollow handle grips. There's a slight difference in hand comfort. But I still occasionally use the product 2 years later, and it's as good as the day I unpacked it. Glad I paid less."
5,An extraordinary book!,"This is a classic work that takes you on a rollercoaster ride of emotion. It is satirical and funny at times, poignant and thought provoking at others. The book is a lesson about overcoming life's hardships and maintaining enduring friendships. Hard to believe this is Armacost's first book. It's an instant classic. I will be looking for more of his work down the road."
3,"Cute movie, but better for older babies","The words this DVD covers are better for older babies, for children 12 months or older. There are a few slow songs which my daughter becomes disinterested in. The words taught are not words I would use too much with my 8 month old, for example, train and airplane. It does cover different toys and sleep.I will like this DVD better when she gets older, but for now, it will sit on my shelf."
3,Baby Signing Vol 2,This video is more advanced. It will be great for my son when he is a little older. I think it's more for 2 to 3 year olds.
3,Not as fun as Volume 1,"We have Baby Signing Time Volumes 1 and 2. Volume 1 is much more fun and engaging - at least to our baby. The music in Vol. 2 is a little less catchy, and the signs taught aren't as relevant (other than ""Please, Thank You, Sorry"") Our baby loves Volume 1 so much, and seems less interested in Vol. 2 that we mostly play Vol. 1 for him."
4,Not as good,"I have The volume 1 and liked it far more than this one; something is definectly missing, and still my son is learning but it does not keep His attention as good as the first one, I usually have to watch it withHim to kind of keep him going."
5,"I love this CD , its great! Bravo Celine!","I wrote another review on this CD but id like to write one more review about this CD! My favourite songs on this album are, The Power Of The Dream Where Does My Heart Beat Now Us With This Tear Pour Que Tu M'Aimes Encore All By Myself (spanish version) Thats The Way It Is The Prayer those above are my favourite songs, the rest of the songs are good but i like the ones above the most! This was my first Celine Dion album and then my grandma bought me her english album called All The Way... A Decade Of Song and its great too. Im going to get 4 more of her albums soon and they will be, Falling into you The colour of my love the french album s'il suffisait d'aimer I just love Celine's beautiful singing she has the best voice. I will write some more reviews when i get those other 4 celine CD's! So if yall dont already has this CD then GO OUT THERE AND GET IT! Its a must have."
1,my god,"her career is goin down, britney rules/i think this compilation can be hidden in a corner, to save embarrassment. she can't sing."
2,"Sorry Celine, this CD isn't that good enough!!!!","Celine tried hard to make this CD be good, but to me I think it isn't really that great. This CD is missing some her other BIG hits like her song Call The Man, and All By Myself (English Version!), Treat Her Like A Lady! Well, and the song Us isn't a hit, nor is the other song Seduces Me. The only good songs that I really love on her are Where Does My Heart Beat Now?, Pour Que Tu M'Aimes Encore, Be The Man, and That's The Way It Is. May be for those who don't have this album should skip this album and buy her new one instead. Sorry Celine!!"
5,Beautiful Songs,"This CD is a great compilation of Celine Dion's greatest songs! I am a devoted fan and this CD did not disappoint me at all! My favorite songs on it are ""Where Does My Heart Beat Now"" and ""With This Tear"" and the song she sang at the Olympics!Celine strikes gold yet again!"
5,You gotta buy this!,"Talk about a great collection! It's not just a buncha hit songs, it's great rare stuff, that are otherwise hard to get--definatly something you want to get!"
1,"the right stuff, a poor container","I Happen to own this volume and this is a tribute to how young, ignorant and tastelesse I was at the time.It is part of a set of five. These are poorly edited, and ill printed on crummy paper. Additionally, the collection happens to have a number of stories that are printed twice, and to omit several of HPL's not so minor stories. A publisher who gives this kind of treatment to a writer and to his customers doesn't deserve your money.If you like HPL, or just want to discover his works, do yourself and the publishing industry a favor, get your book somewhere else, there are some better collections and omnibuses around waiting for the more discriminating reader"
5,"A ""must read"" for every Christian-The Calvary Road","I was so thrilled to be able to purchase these most wonderful books at the very low price that I received. And to top it off, I was allowed to have free shipping. Every book was in perfect condition, too. Now about the contents....I find The Calvary Road one of the most inspiring books to read as a Christian who is seeking a closer walk with your Lord. I guarantee it will change your perspective about life as you learn that it's not all about ""ME"", but about others and becoming humble like Christ. Now, understand, in no way am I placing this book above our Holy Bible!!"
5,An Enduring Book,"I went on Amazon to purchase this book for...oh, I'd say...probably the 6th time. I first read it as a new Christian over 25 years ago. I since have purchased it and loaned it out so many times that I now must buy yet another copy for myself. Originally I read it once a year but it has been at least 10 years since my last read. Pick it up and you will find that it gets right to the point with the first chaper entitled ""Brokeness."" You will be glad you did."
2,Why was my original review removed?,I do not like this book nor do I recommend it. I don't know who removed my original review. I have a right to say if I like a book or not.
5,What?!,"""This album is perfect. I haven't actually heard all of it, but my friend is part of Los Cincos"" Shut up!anyways, this is a great album and Los Cincos were an outstanding band."
1,Broke after 2 month of light usage,"I bought this for my son (1st grader) ... And the metronome stopped working after 2 months of barely being used. Luckily, I was able to return it to amazon and bought a Korg instead."
1,A record that goes in the wrong direction,"Before I say my piece I must say that I am a big fan of Brian Eno. Not only his work as a producer, but his work as an artist as well. I dare say that some of his records (Before and After Science, Here Come the Warm Jets, etc.) are just as good, if not better, than some of the records for other bands that he has produced. But that is not the case on Wrong Way Up. In fact if I were to make a list of the worst records I have ever owned this may even make it to the number one spot. I could go on and on describing why I don't like it (boring songs, no melody, unenthusiastic vocals, etc.) but then I would have to write a novel and waste more time than this atrocious record possibly could. Do not be deceived that because this is a collaboration between two talented people that the product is good. It is not! If you want to waste your money than gamble, at least their is a chance you will get something out of it (unlike this record)."
5,Excellent suggestions,I have been working with students with disabilities for 20 years and find this to be one of the most factual and useful books for parents and professionls in this field.
5,The Only Book You'll Need For Your ADD Teenager,"This book is the best resource for both parents and teachers. I have used alot of this book for help in dealing with behavioral issues with my son and with his teachers for academics. In every case, this book comes out a winner! For any pearent with a teenager who has ADD, this book is a MUST HAVE! It is an easy read, clear, concise, and filled with all the information you need to make it through these difficult years."
5,Excellent product,"I was looking for a slick GPS in my price range, and came across this one.Harman Kardon really knows how to capture the attention of the technology-wise individuals. This product is simply gorgeous! excellent performance!Nice size, touch screen, automatic re-routing really fast, nice guidance, 3d maps, street naming, etc. I have tried to get this device confused by not following its suggestions, and it finds a way to get you back ontrack really fast. Like any other electronic device, is not perfect and needs some resetting from time to time..Not big deal!...overall it is worth it!It comes with everything you will need to protect it and get going fast; except for a way to charge it when in the house. Accessories are not yet available but i'm sure will be available soon enough.For those who can't afford a nuby, this is it."
4,nice buy,"i recieved mine in good condition in shipping,but when useing it did have adjust settings but thats to be expected,only problem i had was getting my t-bolts in thier slots as one side the roatating wheel was not set properly,no big deal as i just reset it.and the holding nuts that hold the cranking wheel seem to be less quality as i broke one tighting it.i just replaced it with a high grade nut.but as far as being true it worked perty well.but still pleased with it as it was a good buy for the money!!!"
3,Spend an afternoon with me,"I rather enjoyed this book. It is a quick read, has a good number of diverse characters, and an uncomplicated plot. But, it's only an average story.Take this with you on a plane trip from Philly to Alaska."
3,Not all That,"It is a lame story. Acting- who care we buy these movies to see the hot chicks in the flesh. That is like saying ""I just read it for the articles"". Truthfully- Not much flesh, no good hot scences. The closest it gets is at the end and it is not all that great."
5,Music ideal for massage sessions,"As a massage therapist I can honestly say that this cd is perfect. With its consistancy and balance, my office space in which I practice massage is turned into a heaven-like atmosphere. This music works especially well with (but not limited to) Reiki, Craniosacral & Thai massage because of its soothing & calming tones. I would think that it would also work well with hypnotherapy, meditation, yoga, tai chi, etc... My clients often times choose this music for their session knowing that it's so peaceful. It's a great purchase!"
2,~Does anyone really think Kid Dork has talent~,I bought this album for my girlfriend who is a fan of this guy and some of his material is ok but this album completely stinks! Can't this dude make up his own stuff or does he like making a career of ripping off others people's work. On this album he strikes again ripping off Warren Zevon note for note. Someone should remind this dude that his 10 minutes of fame ran out like last year.
2,Comes up short,"In the pantheon of Southern rock, including bands like Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Allman Brothers Band, Bad Co., and many others, Kid Rock does not compare. His song, ``Sweet Home Alabama's'' most identifiable hook is a sample of Warren Zevon's intro to ``Werevolves of London.'' Kid Rock's song is intended as a paean to Skynyrd's song of the same name. But it is repetitive and trite. Skynyrd's song took a controversial stand, defending George Wallace, the segregationist governor of Alabama in the 60's, from Neil Young criticism in his song ``Southern Man.'' In comparison, Kid Rock's song is essentially bubble gum music for wanna be rednecks (like him). Zevon also has a song, ``Play it All Night Long,'' which is tangentially about Skynyrd's, ``Sweet Home,'' and far better than Mr. Rock's. Young, Skynyrd and Zevon may have had political differences, but their music at least rocked. In comparison, Kid Rock sucks."
3,Solid CD from Kid Rock,"I know that some have questioned if Kid Rock was going country. This CD is a great mix of country, soul and rock and roll. As a Kid Rock fan I would certainly recommend that you add this to your collection."
4,"I like Kid Rock, how'd that happen?","I am a 50 year old white woman and Rock & Roll Jesus has made a convert out of me. Actually, it was his duet with Sheryl Crow on ""Picture"" awhile ago and ""All Summer Long"" finalized the deal. ""New Orleans"" and ""Blue Jeans and a Rosary"" are also favorites. I always thought of this fellow Michigan boy as a long-haired, screaming, nasty, foul-mouthed white rapster. I tended towards the John Mellencamp, Bob Seger and catchy-tuned Neil Diamond-types. Now I can see how versatile Kid Rock can be. Most of the songs on this album are toe-tapping, head-nodding just plain good stuff. Give it a listen, I hear the kids like this guy, too. ;)"
1,What The Hell?,"Rock N Roll and Kid ""Rock"" don't belong in the same sentance...it's an insult to ROCK N ROll. Kid Rock is not rock N roll or even rock n relevent. He's on the fast track at proving how irrelevent he is. Rock N roll jesus.....a hip hop/country puke mix is nowhere near rock and that butchered version of a crappy song ""sweet home alabama"" renamed on this crapfest album as ""all Summer Long"" is horrid. Kid ""Rock"" (word used loosly when saying his name) should just go away or change his name to Kid Krapfest or no talent Tom.Who in the hell would listen to this. Rock N Roll jesus....he doesen't even deserve to use the word ""rock"" in his name or the title rock n roll. He is insulting rock music, and the rock gods need to punish this posing losera** retard. Kis rock doesen't know what he wants to be and no one cares."
4,Handful of great songs,"I bought this because I wanted to put the song All Summer Long on my Ipod and Itunes did not have it. I like a handful of other songs, but have to make sure my kids aren't around to hear some of them. There are a few that aren't appropriate for young adults."
2,Lame,"Kid Rock's style of trying to be someone he isn't is ever more prevalent on this record. There are a few licks that remind you ever great classic rock bands, but all the too few, which in a way works in his favor. Even the cover clearly rips (I'm sure he didn't intend for it to be taken as a copy of, but a tribute) AC/DC. The writing on this record is as terrible as before, and all the guitar, drum, rap mashing is still tiresome. This isn't rock. This isn't hip-hop. It's someone trying to be better than he is. Next time, Kid Rock needs to write his own lyrics, his own chords and riffs, and be the real Kid Rock and show what really goes on inside his mind, and not the minds of producers."
3,It's ok............,"Some songs have a good beat, some trailer park rock.Hope Warren Zevon gets royalites for his use of his song. Overall it's ok......."
5,Kid Rock - Back On Top!,Kid Rock makes a huge comeback with Rock N Roll Jesus.From the title track to the end track Lowlife.Kid Rock's back SUCKAZ!Everybody bow down to the new King of Rock.ROCK N ROLL JESUS!
5,Versatile; Fascinating,"The song Amen is pure inspiration. Then you have the filthy lyrics sometimes causing me to blush all by myself driving..sometimes too much to even take and I switch the song. Have to give this a five star. Something about it is totally Epic. Definitely, it rocks!"
2,Kid Rock,Its alright. A few decent songs. I've never been a huge fan so maybe real K.R. fans will think its great.
3,Pretty Good,Bought this for my husband who loves Kid Rock. I knew it had one great song on it - All Summer Long. Rest of album is just OK. Probably worth the purchase just for ASL alone.
1,HOW DARE YOU CALL YOUR ALBUM ROCK AND ROLL JESUS,Motley Crue are and will always be the rock genius's God is God kid rock should not have called his album that. White Trash
3,Not wonderful,"This product didn't really help me on my weightloss track. It didn't curb my appetite, but did give a little energy. I would recommend drinking water with this product on a regular basis. I wouldn't buy it again. It just didn't work that well for me."
4,Coming From Somewhere Else,"If you like contemporary Christian music with a bit of country flavor you will enjoy this. These guys show they not only have writing ability, they can sing, harmonize, pick and strum!"
4,Vantec External USB drive,"Good product, nice quality switches on back. Useful with Belkin Transfer cable for transferring old hard drive info to new computer. Can also be used as limited back up. Unfortunately opening info from old drive is complicated (not Vantec Fault) so it mostly now serves as back up. Its not like you can use the old drive and the new one."
5,GREAT!!,MY EXTERNAL DRIVE POWER FAILED AND I ORDERED FROM A MAGAZINE THE REPLACEMENT. WRONG AND A WASTE OF MONEY... WENT TO A STORE AND THEY SOLD ME THE WRONG ONE.... RETURNED IT. THEN WENT TO AMAZON... AND IT WAS A PERFECT FIT... UP AND RUNNING. I GUESS THE 3RD TIME WAS A CHARM
5,"awesome, informative, well-researched","I read this book several years ago and was so impressed with the research, the detail, the style and the care that Tony Martin took to tell the Marcus Garvey story.It is a wonderfully balanced look at his successes, his failures, his faith in God and most of all his impact on our nation.I highly recommend this to history lovers of all backgrounds. You won't be disappointed."
2,Just a sing along,"I purchased this product because it was so highly rated. I was hoping it would be instuctional for me, in terms of introducing and effective implementation of signs. It's just a sing along. So if you are looking for a simple children's show demonstrating about 20 words, your typical repetitions and simple songs, it's o.k. However, if I were to do this over I would just look up the signs from an online website and demonstrated them to my child myself, saving the extra bucks."
2,Left wanting more...,"The DVD itself is good, but you only learn about 20 or so signs, which is not enough to justify the cost."
5,Awesome!,This DVD is so great! I have a 13 month old son and he watches this DVD almost every day. As soon as he hears the music from the dvd he runs to the tv! He has only been watching it for about two weeks now and he just signed baby today! It was so great to see him interacting with the dvd. Mommy and Daddy are learning sign language too. We find ourselves signing all the time now! Highly recommended!
5,fantastic learning tool for baby,This series is an amazing tool for your baby to learn early communication. My daughter loves watching the kids on the video and trying to move her hands like they do. As a 14 month old the signs that she's learned enable us to 'talk' and avoid some frustration.
5,Absolutely Great DVD,"I decided to try using sign language with my second child. I tried another instructional video and learned some, but it seemed like work. With this video not only did my one year old and I learn the signs, but also my 8 year old and husband- who passed through the room and were fascinated enough to watch along.Both informative and entertaining."
4,The Homeboy,"Everyone knows Hershey Candy but not everyone knows there is an orphanage in Hershey, PA that was run by Mr. Hershey, himself. This is the story of one those Homeboys. You will get a clear insight of what happens at Hershey through the eyes of one of the graduates. The story shows what it is like to be an orpan at Hershey and the strides the author made to become a very well known Pastor. You will start the book and not be able to put it down until you finish it. Try it, you will love it."
2,The Cat's Meow?,"The drive makes a a very distracting ""meow"" noise every ten minutes. I've returned the unit to Iomaga, and got a replacement that makes the same noise. Customer service reps first told me that the noise indicates a failing fan motor, and then told me that the noise is normal. Otherwise, the drive seems to work fine. I don't know whether it's a design flaw or a series of bad drives, but be aware that you may end up with an unwanted ""pet"" if you purchase the drive."
2,A good design but the text and pictures are poor,"If you can stand all the gramatical and spelling errors, rambling sentences, font changes and dark pictures, the basic design is good. This is a classic example of a good mechanical mind that couldn't spend a few bucks on some professional editing and layout help. It's also frustrating that the manufactured part numbers could not be specified in the parts list. Emails for this information have gone unanswered. I built an ATV based on this idea successfully but would not reccommend this to anyone looking for a detailed recipe."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Earth has a bit of a problem with a new ice age. Here, no one likes the anti global-warming types. So, readin this part of the book now may seem really, really silly.Along with the people struggling along in coats and gloves on Earth are a few people living in space stations. They have a resource problem as well.One of their people crashlands on Earth, and a group of SF fans try and get him back home. He can't really cope with the gravity, and they have to build a spaceworthy type vehicle. Not too easy."
2,Disappointing,"When I saw this book was Pournelle/Nevin collaboration I immediately bought it. I was most disappointed with it. The plot was incredibly predictable, the story line was incredibly unrealistic.Very disappointing from these 2 excellent writers."
1,How are the mighty fallen,"I've heard people say that this book is good and funny if you're a SF fan. Well, all I can say is that I've been an SF fan for over 40 years and I was nauseated by this book. The chances are slim that anyone who's not a fan would ever hear of this piece of garbage, but on the off chance that they did, I would hope they might consider that being an SF fan used to be a badge of honor. Nowadays it apparently just means you're a Rush Limbaugh dittohead with a light saber. Honestly, we're not all as braindead as this book would have you believe. This is probably the most insulting, ignorant, and wrongheaded novel I've ever read.Help save the Earth and burn this book."
4,Cool!,"I think the best thing about Electronic's debut album is the variety and creativity. Now I have to confess I liked Raise the Pressure a lot too, possibly even a little bit better. But one flaw about their follow-up album is that it is one dimensional, primarily a dance album. Their debut is much more diverse. From slow, beautiful ballads like ""Getting Away With It"" to Barney's rap sessions and Johnny's distorted guitars like on ""Idiot Country"" to lovely, yet brief Classical interludes to dance/electronica based tracks like ""Reality"" to straight-on, in-your-face techno/rock songs like ""Tighten Up"" which are what bands like New Order and Electronic are all about. This album seems to have it all. There are too many highlights to mention, but my favorites are ""Idiot Country,"" ""Reality,"" ""Tighten Up,"" ""Gangster"" and ""Getting Away With it."" All and all a solid piece of work. Stand up with some of New Order's best albums. Enjoy!"
5,Electronic,"Electronic being the self-titled debut album by the group formed by Bernard Sumner of New Order and Johnny Marr of the Smiths is a mix of synth pop, house music and alternative rock. The critics loved this album and it is easy to hear why. Allmusic, NME, VOX and Q loved it and all gave it high marks. Songs that standout on this release are ""Get the Message"", ""Tighten Up"" and ""Feel Every Beat"". 5/5."
5,Paddle Game,Cute teddy bear. It is what it is. I'm happy with it. Let's just say that I don't use it to play paddle ball. I found another use for it.
1,Forget It!,"We got this for the area around our litter boxes (2 boxes, 2 young cats). The boxes are on a carpeted floor at the bottom of a flight of stairs, over which we placed woven throw rugs. The litter boxes are only a couple inches away from a vinyl tile floor. The Swiffer picks up a little bit from the carpet and the throw rugs, but not near clean. On the vinyl tile it doesn't do anything. A broom works better on all three surfaces, though the carpet and throw rugs really need to be vacuumed. It also doesn't work for the loose cat hair (that's what we were told to expect). I wouldn't buy one of these at a garage sale for under $1.00."
5,Great nighttime friend for little ones!,"My 20-month old loves this bear. I put it under the lamp for a few minutes while I get her ready for bed, and you wouldn't believe how much it glows, and all over, not just the belly. I know this bear makes my daughter feel much more secure at night."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CARE BEAR,Someones little girl and boy was burned by Glow In The Dark Care Bears. DO NOT BUY
5,Excellent !,"I live here in Las Vegas & also employed with The Bellagio Hotel & Casino.I have had the pleasure of meeting Nocy & his band & they are a bunch of cool guys.I have watched them play Live, countless many times in The Fontana Lounge & also remember watching them play at The Mirage's Lagoon Saloon back in the mid 90's.Not only does Nocy have alot of fury & energy that comes out in his flamenco style of playing but he & the band can also play the most subtle music too!.Get the album & experience the energy!."
2,Missing Brushes,The Cups look good but are missing the 6 advertised candy brushes. The brushes are cheap but still not happy I need to buy them.
1,Worst Chicago album to me!,"I can see why I saw the cassette version of this album in $1.99 bins in the '90s. Chicago's 21st album was the worst album to me, easily the worst I've heard from them. The album sounds so boring, and the performances sound so uninspiring. Even the Diane Warren-written song sounds lousy, typical of her sappy ballad pap! There's not one memorable song on here, compared to classics like If You Leave Me Now, Love Me Tomorrow or others. Don't hear a lot of their famous horns, only keyboards and pop songs. And Ron Nevison produced this overproduced, overwrought fluff? If Chicago, with their extensive catalog, even thinks about performing one song from this album live, you might want to walk out of the theater to get concessions. They are too multi-talented a band to let themselves get through this commercial flop that this album was in 1991!"
1,Wonder why you don't see a lot of these anymore?,"Thieves have figured out that instead of trying to hacksaw through The Club or defeat the lock, it's much easier to just saw through the steering wheel and slip the thing right off. Took the thieves awhile to figure this out while they sold about a billion of them."
1,Confusing section,"This review is in reference only to Section 2.4. Adding and subtracting fractions with different denominators.I work with adults who need retraining for the job market. Many of them have 'forgotten' fractions. I am always looking for different ways to present certain procedures so that if one way doesn't 'click' with someone then perhaps another one will do so.This particular section of the book contains some of the most convoluted language imaginable - and too much of it. I defy anyone to easily make sense of what she is talking about. This procedure can be tricky, but it needs clear language and examples to get it across to a person.Other parts of the book are obviously well done if these other reviews are finding out what they need to know. So be it."
5,Recommended for high school collections on up,"Any high school to college-level student wishing to master the basics of math needs these comprehensive references that clarifies and explain basic math principles. Two new math studies titles by Debra Anne Ross are particularly to be recommended for math students, as well as non-specialist general readers seeking to develop a basic understanding of algebra. Master Math: Geometry moves from basic topics, examples and applications to building upon basics, Master Math: Algebra surveys algebra by itself and moves from simple algebraic equations to graphing, and her Master Math: Basic Math & Pre-Algebra surveys basic arithmetic subjects and formulas. These are perfect for study, review, or supplemental learning and are recommended for high school collections on up."
3,The Advent of the Algorithym,"The Advent of the Algorithym was not nearly so enjoyable as A Tour of the Calculas. The difference was not in the writing but in the subject. The Calculas is the very embodiment of genius, developed or evolved over an extended period of time by the greatest of minds. A mastery of the mechanics of the Calculas gives one the illusion of its possession; of experiencing, if not possessing, genius. The algorithym does no such thing. While it may prove to be the most powerful tool ever, it's genius is limited to that of its user; reconfirming to most of us our lack of same. Still, The Advent of the Algorithym is enjoyable reading, if only because of the great skill of its writer."
1,Not for a layman,"You need to be a mathematics major to understand the book. If you don't have such background, don't try it. I have to throw it away after the fifth chapter."
1,OK for those interested in 'nontechnical history of ideas'.,"UPGRADE to 2 1/2 stars. Wordy discussion of historical figures with some relation to algorithms. Little information about any actual algorithms. I retract my previous review (1 star) because that regarded this book as an algorithms book, but it is more of a general interest book that I probably would have liked when I was in highschool."
1,Piece of junk,"I bought one of these a few months ago and almost immediately there was a bad connection between the radio and the ear buds within a few months I couldn't get a connection to work at all - it's not the ear buds I replaced those, it's the connection. I exchanged it and the new one is the same - bad connection between the ear buds and radio. Not only that but within 2 days there is tons of static and a loud piercing sound coming out. The only thing I can hear clearly is the loud piercing sound. Don't waste your money."
2,Was a strange movie.,"Okay, I realize that this wasn't a big budget movie but it was just...strange. For example, for the first 20 minutes I had no idea who (or which character) was the protagonist. Once revealed, I never really felt connected or invested in him. Another example, the story takes place in the future....but at times, primarily in the opening battles, it was more like a poorman's version of a Steampunk WWII movie. If it had been the director's intention to make a Steampunk movie, then he failed. If he intended to make a futuristic movie, again he failed. There was some wonderful acting but I feel the actors were limited by the script and/or the director.Was it the worst movie I've ever seen? No.Would I recommend it to anyone? No"
2,Don't waste your money here or at the theaters,"First off it's nice to see a pre-theater release available on Amazon, though I have to agree that it is way overpriced. [...] bucks, might as well go to the theater and see it on the big screen.As for the movie itself it's terrible. They definitely spent all their money on the special effects instead of a writer or lord forbid a continuity director. Without ruining what little plot there is the movie is basically a fantasy movie and throw in some World War I guns and steam powered airships or spaceships if I am to believe the nonsense that passed for dialogue.Save your money and just get it through Netflix when the DVD comes out."
2,Amazon Needs Pre-Thearical VOD period!,"Mutant Chronicles attempts to act at first like a complex dark sci-fi capitalism flick, but suddenly merges into a deeply Christian vibe play on words digital gore; then it twists into The Lord of the Rings (or a magical bomb without instructions), and then leaves you wondering what's going to happen on Mars. The pace starts slow at first, but towards the ending it kicks up. See X-Men Origins: Wolverine (hopefully that appears soon on Amazon VOD) and also this summer line up of movies. In San Francisco, for two people at an AMC to see this would be around $26.00 + $12.00 for a Lg. popcorn + $8.00 for a Med. Drink + a 20 minute wait on previews before the film. So in total Amazon is taking more than 50% off the ticket and also giving us free ammenities with it. Way better than going to the Theater. All Amazon needs to do is sell digital projectors and theater screens that can be used with the rentals."
1,Holy brutally bad,"This movie is terrible. It's got 0 funny (a movie with a bunch of battle-hardened guys on a suicide mission usually has at least one funny dude, but not this one). The action is boring, nothing unique or interesting. Its special effects are crappy at best. The pre-release idea is neat so I figured I'd try it...but this is not the movie to test it with."
2,Bad writer chronicles,"A good cast with flawless acting ability. But, the writers didn't let you feel anything for the characters, not even when they were killed off. It has a WWII feeling with the computer game ""Quake"" scent. If you're a fan of that game, you'll say, I've been here before.Don't waste your money until the DVD hits the bargain bin in about 8 months."
4,The Master Cleanse,"Nice and cheap book, give you everything you nedd to know about this cleanse method."
1,Bunk,"There is absolutely no evidence this works for anything except losing muscle mass and teaching your metabolism to not eat much, so that when you do start getting the calories you need, you just gain all the weight back (in the form of fat).Also, no toxins crystallize at the joints except for uric acid (aka, gout, which can be avoided by limiting meat intake, the only helpful suggestion in this book).If considering this diet, find out from an actual health care professional exactly what you'll be doing to yourself"
2,Nastiest Diet Ever,"I thought I'd be able to do this diet after my mom did it for a month with no cheating and my sister and brother-in-law tried it too. I made it one day and then at night I got terrible heartburn from the cayenne pepper and I couldn't sleep. All I could think about was food. I only had 20 pounds to lose, so it wasn't a do or die situation, so I got up and ate and felt much better. Now I'm on atkins and am loving this diet. It's the first one I've ever been on and love how I can still feel full and not think about when I can eat next. The guy who wrote the Master Cleanser is about as weird a cross as Scientologist L. Ron Hubbard and one of those yogi green hippies."
4,The Original Master Cleanse,"This book was very informative about the positive effects that doing the master cleanse has on your body... Great stuff. I was looking for, however, the book that gives you tips and helpful ideas that would help me to complete the ""Master Cleanse"""
3,different way to lose weight!,WOW! You need to be near a bathroom AT ALL TIMES! I did it only for 7 days. Lost 11 lbs. Felt weak and tired but was able to handle it. Only reason why I stopped was the sea salt drink was to hard to stomach. Read the book first.
1,Don't waste your money!,"This book is full of its author's creepy ideas about life and its meaning, spirituality and hoodoo. If that's what you're looking for, okay; but if you're looking for a booklet to guide you through a cleansing of your body's major organs, you may as well just type ""lemonade cleanse"" into your search engine and get some guidelines. Only a few pages near the center of this pamphlet are worthy of being used as a health reference; otherwise, the information is about as valid as ""The National Enquirer"" that it quotes on p. 32 (now THERE'S a source of information!)."
2,results not as expected,"I was very excited when I read about the master cleanser on a website. I had been eager to cleanse my entire body and start a whole new diet, based on more wholesome foods and giving up on refined foods and sugars.I am on the 9th day of my diet, and I must say I am very disappointed. I am in a permanent state of hunger, and I should say it doesn't pay off! I've been expecting for elimination of tons of mucus, phlegm, vomiting... and I've experienced none so far! I feel tired and sleepy all the time. Even though it is not a reducing diet, I was expecting to lose more weight, because I consider myself overweight. I am 5'7"", and weigh 175 lb. I've lost so far 8lb. The good thing is the salt water bathing. It REALLY cleanses your digestive system.I've come to the conclusion that there is NO diet that suits all people. There are so many variables to be considered: race, blood type, age."
5,A great book,"For years I have been working out and watching what I eat. Nothing seem to help me to loose weight. I started having problems with my joints, ulcers, headaches, fatigue and other health problems. The 'Master Cleanser' book changed my life. I only did it for 15 days and I lost 20 pounds. I've never felt as good as I do now. I am 41 years old but I feel as if I was on my 20's. My joint and other health problems are gone. I have the energy I haven't had in a long time. This is a must to do cleansing. Specially if you are experiencing helth problems. I keep getting complement after complement from people that know what I looked like before. Thank you Dr. Stanley Burroughs."
2,Mentioned in a novel and in demand again!,"How funny that this booklet is mention in 'Between Boyfriends' - a great book BTW - and now tons of people are looking for it. This is old news, and if it had true merit it wouldn't have needed the mention for a revival! Of course you will lose weight, you aren't eating!"
5,Rare Find,"I use this video in classes sometimes to demonstrate how utterly chilling a film can be without excessive gore, explosions, etc., etc. Rarely have I seen such perfect gothic atmosphere, period detail, and great ensemble acting. If you love a truly frightening ghost story, The Woman in Black is a vintage pleasure to be enjoyed again and again. It's particularly refreshing to find a powerful story that isn't dependent on tired and overblown special effects."
5,One of the two scariest movies I've ever seen,"This movie was terrifying. The only other movie I've ever seen that really scared me was ""Sixth Sense"". The sounds of the pony coming over the moors and getting stuck, the interior scenes of the bedroom, all so real and terrifying. Don't watch this movie when you are home alone!!Absolutely the best horror movie I've ever watched."
2,The Woman Is Dull,"Read so many great reviews of this film -- it's SO scary, they said. Finally tracked down a copy of the DVD. Now, I absolutely love horror films, everything from the old giallos by the likes of Mario Bava and Dario Argento, to the Friday the 13th and similar francises, and on to The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, Evil Dead and all the other GREAT horror films of our time. But The Woman in Black is not among them. It is slow, tedious, and incredibly dull. I warn any of you that are thinking of spending good money on a copy of this to wait until it shows up on television or in your video store or something. You'll be glad you did when you come to the end of this flick and find yourself yawning instead of screaming."
3,Not a really scary ghost classic.,"This BBC movie is a bit of a let down for me. I have seen better. I liked the fact that it did not contain much blood and gore like the stupid gore, anamated silly supposidly scary ghost films of today. The only truly scary Haunted House ghost story film that can actually be called a scary movie is the 1960s film called the ""THE TURN OF THE SCREW"" starring DEBRA KERR. Now that was a real ghost story! Another really scary one is the black and white version 1960s Haunted House film called ""THE HAUNTING"" I do not consider ""THE WOMAN IN BLACK"" to be a really scary ghost film. Its O.K. though."
5,If you like a good ghost story sans the bloody gore,"I watched this on TV sometime back in the mid to late nineties I really dig a good Victorian horror.. I'd say this & haunted (starring Aidan Quinn & Kate Beckinsale (sp?)probably rank highest on the meter of spine chilling sleep with the lights on duvet covering face & every shadow a potential threat minus the unfortunate cheesy end in haunted, I highly recommend both.. I don't understand the justification of such a high price for a made for TV movie though.. I don't want to spoil a movie I do wonder if the new Daniel Radcliffe movie is a remake of this? we're yet to see.. This does center around a young lawyer, an eerie house out on marsh land whose last owner went mad & died.. & town people with a secret they don't wish to share with outsiders.. & well the rest must be watched & not spoken of..."
5,a horror that will make you wince,This is the best horror movie of this genre I have ever seen.You are drawn comfortably into a scene only then to be dropped into terror.This clever technique is what sets this movie apart from the rest.I have spoken to many other people who said that they didn't sleep well after seeing this movie.And we would all watch it again.
2,Friends Season 5,"my purchase arrived in good time. case was in good condition. said it was new but the cds didnt play good. some episodes would skip and not play at all, not very happy with item."
1,Have seen a lot better ones,"I give it a star comparatively to other sitcoms. I have seen other sitcoms which are far better and funnier than the Friends. This should be categorized as soap opera instead of comedy. No punch lines, jokes are flat and pretentious. 'if' laugh track can be turned off separately, the episodes fall short of being a comedy. Laugh tracks put in there are just to induce viewers to laugh."
4,Say it right,This is one of the best Friend Seasons ever. Jennifer Aniston once again shows everyone why she deserves her own series. Jennifer Aniston plays the character Rachal Green. Buy your Copy today.
4,Looks really good.. medium quality,Dress and boots look really good. I already washed the Boots and they needed some stitches all round the silver top after that. The dress it is very well made.Really good for the price
4,Great (except for boots),"My daughter loved this costume. The only problem was the boot covers were SO tall! They went all the way up her thighs. No problem though, it was cold out so we just used her pink sparkly snow boots instead."
5,my granddaughter is 6years old she looked so cute very nice,my granddaughter 6 yrs old wore size medium she looked so cute very nice custume would buy again
3,Technics Can't Make A Good Surround Sound Receiver,"Technics had a great reputation for producing a high quality, long lasting product in a reasonable price range. I purchased a SA-DX930 about three years ago after my first Technics surround sound receiver took a dump after about five years of use. It worked well right up until it crashed and burned. Before I had these last two Technics receivers I had a Technics non-surround stereo receiver for ten years. I sold it to a friend, it was working just fine and they kept it for several years after that. I don't think Technics can make a decent, good quality, long lasting surround sound receiver. I know one thing I've learned my lesson, Technics use to be a quality product but not any more. This time I'm going to do my research and buy the best I can in my budget but I can guarantee you this it won't be a Technics! And it's to bad because they use to be a great product for the money."
4,"Opinionated, sometimes dogmatic, but fascinating.","Fascinating overview of intellectual development in human civilization. Cromer goes out on a limb with his remarks on the impossibility of exploring space, but he is right on target in his remarks on the abysmal state of American science education. With PC dumbing down education and people like Paul Feyerabend ridiculing the notion that science is of any use whatsoever, Cromer is a breath of fresh air."
4,Great Sci-fi Fantasy,"This is a dark tale of a collapsed civilization. The setting is the far future, and the world has become barbaric. Most importantly, all women are treated like animals, only good for breeding. The main character is a young girl who dares to hope for freedom from this oppression. This novel is full of action and suspense. There are many interesting characters, like the outcast jewish man that becomes her companion. Great fantasy novel."
5,Interesting,"These Unfinished Tales give some much desired background information on Middle-Earth. Turin and Tuor have their lives explained in this book, as they were somewhat abridged in the Silmarillion. Read this book."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Unfinished tales is a hodge-podge of stuff. There are bits and piecesof lots of things, and it is not all fiction. You get notes, backstory,comments, the odd essay type piece of writing, and other stuff. Youreally want to be a pretty hardcore Tolkien type to want to buy this,rather than borrow to flip through. A lot of people will find it verydull."
4,Canon AA Battery recharger,Works great! Best to own 8 AA rechargable batteries so you always have 4 to change out.
3,Good charger and batteries,"This is a fairly nice charger, but there is definately better. It is nicer to have a charger that can charge each battery seperately depending on the needs of each. This does do the job though, and the batteries last fairly long too."
4,All Around Good Product,This is an all around good charger / battery set. The batteries charge pretty quickly (all four batteries are done overnight and charging just two batteries decreases the charging time even more). Once the batteries are charged they last in my camera much longer than the store bought batteries I had previously.The only think that I don't really like about the charger is that while charging and when done the unit produces a rather loud buzzing sound. If the device it in a quiet room it needs to be unplugged when charging is finished.All around this is a good product and I would recommend it.
2,uh Battery's,"I go through a lot of battery's for my camera, and other remote control things I have....The battery life is not very long and I have to continue to recharge a lot....Other battery chargers worked better..."
2,Canon Battery Charger Pack,I bought this item for $40 online and then found out my Canon Camera didnt need a Cannon brand charger and I could have bought one for $10 instead. In total I spent for this charger which included the shipping and handling. Not worth it. Go to another store and by one for $10
4,battery charger,"If you own a Cannon, this is the way to go for batteries. It does make a difference as far as batteries. Pay the few extra dollars to get the Cannon recharger."
5,Perfect Hair Care!,I've been looking for a after shampoo hair care product for a while since my routine brand had been discontinued.Sabastian was not only everything I was searching for but it totally exceeded the product that I was useing for years.I recommended this highly and I will be reordering it very soon !
2,Beautiful but doesn't last,We love this puzzle. My son is 3 and puts it together about 3 or 4 times a day. After a week the pieces started chipping and breaking off which is dangerous for our 15 month old. Very disappointed in M&D!
4,BR549 Has Something Snappy!,"After I saw BR549 on A Prairie Home Companion, I had to get some of their music. The Album that was suggested to me was Tangled In The Pines. It doesn't disappoint. The tunes I wanted to hear were there. They know honky tonk music!"
1,"Liberal sisters growing greyer, wrinkled, fewer-yet jubilant","Sister Schneiders' book is a fascinating read. But not for the reasons she would want. She exudes a self-congratulatory tone --which she shares with an ever-dwindling puddle of radicalized & wrinkled women religious. Why are they getting greyer, fewer, and more self-absorbed? Together they seem to be celebrating an outworn 60's-style radicalism that remains as defiant as it is barren. For those who want to find real treasure, study Mother Theresa..."
5,Back Cover Copy,"A wicked, often hilarious look at opinion-makers...SCRIBBLE SCRIBBLEIs a bestseller because ""Nora Ephron can write about anything better than anybody else can write about anything.""- John Leonard, The New York TimesSCRIBBLE SCRIBBLEIs a bestseller because ""it's funnier than anything else I've read this year.""-Martin Levine, NewsdaySCRIBBLE SCRIBBLEIs a bestseller because Nora Ephron wrote it. She is ""as tart and refreshing as the first gin and tonic of the summer.""-Joe McGinnis, The New York Times Book Review""Shrewd and funny!""-Walter Clemons, Newsweek""Pure delight!""-Playboy"
2,Liked One of them,I love old movies. Bringing up Baby is classic and hilarious! We were excited to see the others when our dvd arrivesd - but didn't like the other three. I'll probably try to sell it. Or we'll just keep it for Bringing up Baby.
5,Romanitc Comedies,"One of my all time favorite movies is ""Philidelphia Story"". This collection of Kate Hepburn movies is awesome. Love it!"
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"EACH DISC IS SUPPOSE TO HAVE 2 MOVIES ON THEM, ONLY 1 MOVIE APPEARED ON EACH DISC. THE PURCHASE WAS A RIPOFF."
1,Not Everything it's advertised to be,"I purchased this for use in Ireland. The unit is compact and attractive, but I found it of limited use for my purposes. First..only after I purchased it did I find out that it wasn't recommended for electronic devices such as computers. Then, when we tried to use it with my daughter's flat iron in Ireland, the flat iron kept shutting off! Obviously, that is another use it was not suited for! Have you ever tried to deal with a teenage girl who is frantic that she can't straighten her hair? It ain't pretty!Finally, even though securely packed in its pouch, one of the power prongs on the converter simply snapped off! Kind of shoddy construction for a Samsonite product! I'm in the process of filing a complaint with Amazon and Samsonite. We will see what happens."
2,"Not for Ipod, Battery Packs, Phones Etc","When you read the description about the product on the web it does not say that the product is only good for small appliances and not for the Ipod, phones, Battery packs etc. Be sure you only need this for your hair dryer and not computer, Ipod etc. It specifically says on the packaging, not on the internet, that you cannot use it for those items. I notice in the reviews that some people used it anyways. Up to you. I do not have time now as I leave in a few days to get the correct product online. Frustrating."
5,"Privilege, Power and Difference",A very readable discussion of the dynamics of privilege in its many forms. Excellent section on where to go from here.
5,Consistency of Original Scent Is Best,"I have been using Irish Spring Soap Bars for years. I must admit that I was enticed to buy my first bar by those alluring television commercials. I bought a bar and I was amazingly pleased. I loved the scent and also the way this soap really removed dirt. It also has staying power for reducing body odors for extended periods of time. I truly feel clean and refreshed after each use of this product. Another important feature about this product is the fact that the manufactures have not attempted to improve the product. Instead, they have maintained the integrity of their product without significantly tampering with it. They have offered alternatives scents but have still kept the original available and untouched. If you have a good thing going, why change it. This is a staple bathroom product in our household."
4,Audio is good,Good audio from this DVD. Nice arrangement of the peice. Worth having for your collection.
3,"This title is easy to follow, but the training itself is not","I was a little disappointed with this title because it really did not teach me any new excercises. I was expecting some really nifty insider training material but the most technical this book ever got was when it showed me how to do a proper chin-up. The only part worth looking at was the twelve week and four week agendas. I am not saying that it is easy to pass this course, but i don't think it was worth my hard earned $15 too see a couple of pages that really say anything."
5,Excellent source on conditioning.,"Very descriptive, excellent pictures, I only wish we had a local waterway or a pool to swim in to put the entire book to good use."
5,Second Best Fitness Book in the World,"This is a wonderful book, second only to the same author's Maximum Fitness. It presents an extremely rigorous and effective fitness program that uses no weights. The program provides a lot of variety and the workouts are fun. They are also very, very difficult. But if you stick with the program you are going to see some pretty stunning results, both physical and mental. And that's a promise.A bonus is that you will laugh out loud several times when you first read through the exercises and when you read about what real Navy Seal training is like.After running through this program a couple times, anything will seem possible to you. That's something you can't put a price on, and I think that Stewart Smith has done us a great service by writing this book."
5,Book and DVD for under $15 bucks? Great Deal!,"Wow! I can't believe what a value this is. The video is awesome and the book is the real deal. Stew Smith is the guru of military -- SEAL --- fitness and this is exactly what I needed to get started on my quest to be in top shape. The book contains detailed workout plans and exercise instruction tips etc.The bonus video (DVD) is very helpful for form, swimming (underwater shots are awesome!),etc. Woirth the price alone. Great job!"
4,An excellent book for the advanced athlete,"One caveat: This is not a book for the beginner or untrained individual! The so-called beginner's program is too tough for most people. The progression of exercises/reps is only appropriate for someone who is in very good shape. That said, this is an EXCELLENT book for those looking for a challenging workout. I highly recommend this book for those going into the military or those interested in law enforcement. The core routine is made up of the same exercises you'll be tested on (e.g. sit-ups, push-up, 1.5 mile run). In terms of equipment, you'll need a pull-up bar, a dip station, and a running track."
4,superb fitness manual,"excellent fitness guide, great warmup and stretch drill, well ilustratedvery readable with lots of information conveyed quickly. May not be the best for the beginner but for those with some experience and looking for a new approach highly recommend."
5,Great Structure and Organization,"If you are looking for a book that will get you into shape as well as give you a great look, well this is the book for you. I used this book a few times now and each time always see results. I must say one thing though if you are not dedicated don't buy this book. You will just be wasting you money. It is for a person with a great deal of desire and personel resolve. All in all this book is worth its weight in gold. No matter what physical expectation you are looking for this is the book for you. I have tried many other workout books and none seem to even come close to the quality of this. Just get this book and it will be your companion for a long time."
4,Scooby Doo- Always an entertaining show,"As always, Scooby Doo is a big hit with my kids. Especially, my 4.5 year old. We need some new episodes!"
5,I read this book and haven't smoked now for over 40 years!,I am a retired clinical psychologist and have helped many of my clients stop smoking over a period of several decades. Brean's little book is the best I know about. I used it myself over 40 years ago and have not smoked a cigarette since then. (I occasionally smoke a pipe or a cigar--maybe once or twice a year.) The book is based on sound psychological principles and emphasizes proper preparation before you actually quit. A unique feature is its day-by-day pages that you must not read until you quit and then only read each page on its assigned day. It's remarkable how much those little pages help!
1,Boring boring boring,"When IQ started out (the albums Tales From The Lush Attic and The Wake), they were the only group that could do something with the psychotic and mad quality that made Genesis' early albums so interesting. As such, they could have saved the entire genre. But no, Pete Nicholls left the band to pursue his mediocre talents elsewhere and IQ went pop and followed in the footsteps of Mike & The Mechanics. By the time everything had went wrong and Nicholls returned to the group, the harm was done. Gone was the madness, old were the musicians. And what do old rock musicians do? They make boring albums."
1,Warning,"This is the first product from Amazon that has been absolutely worthless.Avoid ""Taylor "" manufacturer as plague, unless you want to exercise Yogaor are ready for the worst aggravation in a long time.Jiohn"
1,terrible experience,"well, when the maximum-minimum thermometers arrived (I bought two of them), one was already broken, and the other one was not working properly, I followed the instructions but it was very difficult to get the blue liquid column without air spaces in between, when I finally was able to almost do that, I found out that the maximum little marker will not mark the maximum temperature!!!, it keeps going down.....then I tried to arrange for a replacement with the seller (CrazyDavesToolShed), they told me that they will ship them right away....well I am still waiting for the new thermometers to arrive.... I am disappointed not only with the thermometers but also with the seller!!!!"
3,The first book in the series is better,"The first book is better than this one. It was a good read but I was hoping for more after the first. The characters in the story are flimsy, not reallife and the plot is predictable. If you liked the first book then I recommend that you buy the second in order to see what is going to happen. However I would not recommend that you buy the third book. I do not have the third and I do not expect to buy it in the future either."
2,Yuck.,"An extremely disappointing sequel to a promising 1st novel. Reign of Shadows looked like it would become a series of at least decent quality, but suddenly dropped by the 2nd novel. I thought, what the hell, it'll still be good for nice bouts of mindless reading. Nope."
1,Awful textbook.,"This text book alone forced me to drop my college class. To say this book is confusing is an understatement. All other books I've read teach romanji, and then go onto hiragana, katakana, then eventually kanji. This book, however... was not what I expected or had braced myself for. Even my instructor told me it wasn't the best book! (He was a native Japanese speaker!) This was all the college bookstore had which is a shame. This is Japanese written with poor phonetics and a bad attempt at that. ""zya"" instead of ""ja?"" This is not the correct way to learn Japanese, I'm sorry. It only complicates the easiest of exercises to learn the language.I dropped the class after a few weeks of confusion and picked up ""Japanese for Everyone"" which I've had better luck with so far, learning with my friends or on my own.In closing I have to say, please do not use this outdated, inaccurate book. It makes learning Japanese a confusing, tedious chore. No fun at all."
2,Egypt Exposed? They Must Have Left That Part Out,"I was extremely disappointed in this video. I have watched a few of Bauval's lectures and interviews online, but this conversation with him, doesn't even share the amount of information you find free on YouTube.If you had never heard of the man, possibly, it would be worth some amount of money, but NOT for the price Reality Films is selling it for. I was expecting what the title suggests...""Egypt Exposed: The True Origins of Civilization,"" but it didn't expose anything at all. Actually, if I'd known what I'd be receiving, I would not have ordered this video. It's listed as a documentary, but that's a matter of opinion. He tells about his background and how he became interested in the subject matter of the Pyramids. That isn't an expose as far as I'm concerned.There's nothing new here, and it was a waste of time and money. A huge rip-off in my opinion."
2,Misleading advertising...,"The picture on this item show 2 titanium picks....I received one...the way this is set-up, it leads you to believe that you are getting 2."
5,Amo esta seriee!,Siempre me gusto mucho esta serie!! y a mi familia tambien. La calidad de imagén y audio es excelente! Espero por el Volumén 2 :)
3,Good Educational Product,I am a teacher and purchased this video to show to my class after we had done a unit on the book. It is really the only video of this story so if you are looking for the Ira Sleeps Over movie this is your only selection. The kids liked it for class but I don't think it would work just for entertainment in the home. It may come across as rather cheesy.
2,Good for those born the morning they are scheduled to work in a restaurant.,"Wow. I have worked in the service industry since age 13, and 99% of the information this book contains is pure common sense. I was recently hired at the finest of fine dining restaurants and wanted a resource for very high-end technical service procedures. This was a poor choice. I did find the chapter on tableside service slightly enlightening, but only slightly, it too was overly dumbed-down. The random use of a highlighter by a previous owner added a bit of amusement to my reading experience. If you have any experience in a dining room whatsoever, an average amount of common sense and a functioning brain then this book is not for you. If, however, you are painfully incompetent and have no critical thinking skills, this book might be helpful to you. People who need this as a resource genuinely have no place in the dining room."
5,The Way of the Bodhisattva by Shantideva,"This book is wonderful. Shantideva, in earnestly searching for an awakened state of being shares his very human struggles he encounters on the Bodhisattva path. We share the same internal questioning with him and can be inspired by his determination. This treatise can be helpful to newer and more seasoned practitioners of all schools of Buddhism."
1,don't buy.,"This gun isn't worth the price. Instead, get the m4505, its practically identical gun with the same velocity but 1/2 the price!"
5,excellent,"bought 2 sets as xmas presents for granchildren. i don't think i could have thought of anything better they absolutley love,love,love. they work really,really well. i wanted this kind because the ones for kids are junk. these are definetley not junk. anyone who buys will not regret."
4,"Great mini album, cant wait for the full length.","Verry promising, cant wait to buy the full length. The fact that its being put out on Rhymesayers is even better. If you like Greenhouse Effect, or Dead Ringer from RJD2, you would most likely enjoy this. Word of advise, dont buy the EP from here its more than twice the retail cost, go to sandboxautomatic.Later,Hip Hop fans"
5,Worth the time to listen,"The music has a sweeping quality which i enjoy while driving in particular. There are pieces i wish there was more of (the drumming), but having just that bit of it makes for an interesting interlude in the listening. I can easily picture the scenes as the music surrounds me, though i've never seen the movie. A nice choice."
3,"I found the book useful, but a little hard to read.","I am a college student majoring in education. I read this book for a class. I feel as if any one going into the field of education should read this book. It gives a good view of how students can take certain remarks as offensive even if you thought is was harmless. The book was a bit boring at times which made it hard to read. The author also was repetitive in my opinion. He would tak about one student in one chapter, then two chapters later talk about the same student again. You really had to stay on top of the book to understand a lot of what he was saying. Overall, I felt that it was a good book."
3,Ecco shoes,"The sizing really wasn't true. I usually wear the size I ordered, but they stretched out dramatically, even after re-lacing. I wish they fit better because I really do like how they look and they were comfortable when they fit well. I would recommend ordering one or one-half size smaller that what you usually wear. Wish I did..."
2,mixed feeling,"performance is great.sound is presented with pcm digital recording and it explodes.the probrem is the digital transfer of video.this disc shows digital noise consistently throughout the performance. especially when the object moves fast, such as the movement of conductor's arms.once you start noticing the noise that follows every movement of mr. barenboim's arms, it distracts you much.since the performance is great, i'm very dissapointed with the poor video transfer..."
5,"great goggles, no water in the eyes :)",Bought 4 pairs of these for boys aged 5-11 and they work great for all of them. No water in the eyes and nicely adjustable to fit each of their heads.
5,great goggles,"My two boys, 8 and 10 are on the local swim team and a lot of the kids use these goggles. They work well for my boys. I like the previous versions of these better when you could pull on the straps to adjust them while you had them on. Now you have to take them off and unlatch, adjust and relatch but other than that, they are great. We've owned a few of these and have to keep buying more, not because they wear out, but because they get lost."
3,They're Just Fine,"Swim Goggles, what can I say? They keep the water & chlorine out and help a little girl feel more confident in the pool. They do the trick."
5,Jack Early,"Brian Rust's American Dance Band Discography chronicles every American dance band recording made between 1917 and 1942. The 2 volumes are arranged alphabetically by band name, with a chronological listing of recordings, with dates, matrix numbers, catalog numbers, as well as any other pertinent information. They supplement Rust's Entertainer recordings discography for roughly the same period, so any fan of '20s and 30's popular music will probably want that one, too. I can't imagine any fan of popular music of this period being without these volumes."
1,eh..,"Scent is pleasant enough yet almost too light and not at all long-lasting. I didn't notice any special pheromone effect and while my bf thought the scent was ok, he didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. Had a friend try it out and she reported no pheromone effects either. Next time I'll be spending $50 on my favorite perfume instead."
1,Doesn't work,This product doesn't really work for me. I've tried multiple ways of distributing the dose and tried a variety of cover smells for a couple of weeks with no results. In fact it doesn't seem to work with my body chemistry at all. I'm kind of bummed actually!
2,Boring just like Burn,Never again will I buy another Deep Purple Album with Coverdale. He just goes on and on with his boring vocals. No interesting interplays like in Fireball. I give it two stars only because the title track is decent. Stay away unless you like pop music.
5,An Overlooked Classic,"This record is largely overlooked in the vast Deep Purple catalogue and it's a bit hard to understand why. Deep Purple NEVER in their 40+ years got as funky as they did on this record, and that owes mostly to bassist/lead vocalist Glenn Hughes. Along with lead vocalist David Coverdale, this Purple lineup featured an outstanding vocal duo and mindblowing harmonies. The tunes where the funk/soul really flows and Hughes' imprint runs deep are Love Don't Mean A Thing, Holy Man, Hold On and You Can't Do It Right. There's also a couple of great bluesy ballads, again somewhat out of character for Purple: The Gypsy and Soldier Of Fortune. A very unique, a very strong, and an extremely soulful, heartfelt Deep Purple record."
5,Deep Purple's Most Misundersood Album,"Deep Purple - ""Strombringer""5 Stars = MasterpieceJust about everybody's least favorite DP album, but ""Stormbringer"" is an excellent vocals showcase. Coverdale & Hughes just sing their hearts out on this album, showing their sincere & valid love of r & b & soul. The songs are just incredible in achieving their goals as they transcend their influences for an album unlike any other Blackmore era Deep Purple, or any other album by a heavy metal band at the time for that matter. Fans of the band hated this album & any many still do, to bad to, because ""Stormbringer"" showed that a heavy metal band could be both heavy & soulful on the same record & make it work. No small achievement, a real gem!"
5,A GREAT album!,"The first time i was introduced to Deep Purple was by listening to this album. I LOVED the funkiness, the bluesiness, and great guitar work of Ritchie Blackmore and vocals of David Coverdale. Although others may say that this isn't the typical Deep Purple album, it STILL is, by far, a great piece of work. I loved every song on this disc, with the stand-outs being, Lady Double Dealer, Soldier of Fortune,Stormbringer, and Gypsy. David Coverdale gave an excellent performance on vocals throughout the record, and the harmonies fantastic! I don't see how ANYONE can call this a mediocre record or give it a rating of ""not bad"". It is one of my all-time favorite records. Ritchie Blackmore's guitar solo on Lady Double Dealer is absolutely awesome! A big thumbs up and a must for anyone's collection!"
2,Wait Til you have everything else,"In 1974 my best friend's brother began bragging about how good this Deep Purple album was. I could't wait to hear it becuase I had already heard Burn and Machine Head. I was, as you will be too, disappointed. This album deserves the 2 stars I rate it and nothing more other than the killer album cover of the stormbringer and the tornado. Compared to Burn, Stormbringer is lame and gutless. The sound is muffled and neither Coverdale nor Hughes sound as strong as they do on Burn. Blackmore sounds bored.If you like Burn, then don't get this album. Others give it a high rating because they love DP, as I do. Unfortunately, this album is not one of the better ones. Get Burn, you'll appreciate its clarity and Blackmore's enthusiasm of playing with new members."
4,Psychological exploration of 1950s relationships,"This realist novel, completed in 1956 but not published until 1988, is an effective exploration of the psychological subtleties of a four-way relationship. Jim Briskin, a classical music radio announcer, still in love with his ex-wife Pat, introduces her to a teenage couple, Art and Rachael. Pat becomes involved with the violent and possessive Art. Meanwhile, in her curious, willful way, Rachael falls in love with Jim. The ""broken bubble"" of the title refers to a minor incident in which one Thisbe Holt rolls around naked inside a plastic bubble at a convention of optometrists, who end up filling it with junk and smashing it. The broken-bubble image is suggestive of the egoic bubbles that Jim, Pat, Art, and Rachael all float in, that separate them in their relationships. During the course of the novel these bubbles are broken."
4,"These stories do the job, most of the time","Cheever could pour out the histories of Long Island life as easily as he could a cocktail.You can hear the craggy voice while faint far away the evening bay waves lap.Sometimes, he wanders, and wanders. But in the best instances, he does return to some thought close to where he beganOf the three big realistic American Johns, along with Steinbeck and Updike, Cheever fits well in the middle, a mean--in both senses.He stands square between Steinbeck's good hand in the practical lower classes and Updike's dazzling nose on the ambitious upper classes.Cheever's hand is as steady as his characters' are not.I feel I could build one of his houses just from the sensations you get from the best of these stories."
3,"Well-crafted, lovely language... But no teeth","Ever hear mountains of praise heaped on something and then, when you check it out yourself, mutter, ""But there isn't any there there!""I don't want to say this emperor has no clothes. These stories are not all the same. Some of the best are about average people trying to make ends meet in the big city--a classic theme that has lately been neglected. But too many fit the old ""New Yorker"" formula perfectly: Careful sketch of an affluent northeastern WASP family, conflict over adultery (or the risk of it), over money, or over some old sibling conflict, leading to a magnificently written two-sentence epiphany that has very little dramatic punch.I guess I find Cheever's stories to be beautifully crafted but emotionally distant. For similar subject matter handled with much more compassion (and passion), I recommend Updike's stories."
2,over-rated,"Wanting to have good national writers is a powerful motivator. I think that this has happened with John Cheever, from the retrospective praise of his work to our fascination with his bisexuality and persistent alcoholism. Indeed, his personal demons are far more interesting than his prose.While I read isolated stories in mags and liked them, reading them in a lump like this makes his weaknesses seem very plain indeed. His stories almost all revolve around a common plot: things in the suburbs don't turn out the way we want, and most often, a lot of alcohol does little to soften the blow of deteriorating reliationships, alienated children, and nothing to do in retirement. When you read 20 stories like that in a row, Cheever appears as a feeble writer indeed. This a throwaway magazing writing, not some timeless achievement that should enter the pantheon.Not recommended."
2,good choice for the meek,"If you're anxious to dive into Devo but don't want to shell out 30 bucks for Pioneers Who Got Scalped and/or are VERY skeptical, buy either this or Greatest Hits first. This album is supposed to be composed of Devo's ""dirtier"" songs, complete with un-necessary explicit lyrics sticker. However, more then half of it is songs lifted off of ""Duty Now For The Future""! If you buy both that and Q&A, you pretty much have the majority of Greatest Misses. The only real reason to get this is for the classic Penetration In The Centerfold (only found on the Infinite Zero re-release of Duty Now, which is damn near impossible to find.) Bottom line: stay away unless you're first causally getting into Devo or if you're a diehard spud collector."
4,Graco Highchair Review,"This highchair is great for any little person. Plus, it doesn't take up a lot of space. The only downer is that you have to assemble it yourself."
2,pass on this scanner,"We also use this scanner at work. The thing is horrible. We get error codes, it jams, software malfunctions (ie. ask it to scan and it shoots back an error, this even after re-installing the software). Only reason we have it is because it's a work-approved device...The reason for two stars: it can scan a document but only after too much work to get it to work."
4,"Jeepers, Creepers where'd you get those peepers","EXCELLENT! Just what you want in this type of low budget production, a film where the director/producer actually shows loads of full frontal female nudity just for the sake of showing it!!!!!! It is actually quite a good campy schlock movie played for laughs in the right dosages and even has a bit of decent gore. The plot is as shown as in the Amazon review and is certainly one of those great classics movies to watch after a fill of beer and curry."
5,Poirot movie collection set 6,"Love, love David Suchet as Poirot...I am sure Agatha, herself, is pleased with his performances....Would love to see more of him in other presentations as well."
5,Very enjoyable ! you'll have a GREAT TIME,"This series was much better than the last especially the Third Girl. As always, Mr David Suchet does a stellar job. I liked the Halloween drama the best ."
4,JumpStart Learning,"This was the best preschool software that I have found. It teaches all of the things your preschooler needs to know. Colors, Letters, Numbers, and more are what your preschooler will have in store when you buy this for them. So go ahead and grab it and help your preschooler learn away."
3,"I thought this was ok, but then I tried out another program","I learned to read with 100 Easy Lessons, and have taught many children to read using this program (as a tutor.) 100 Easy Lessons works, but it is boring - for the parent AND the child. A new program has come out, by the same author that is 100 times better - called Funnix Beginning Reading. The program is on the computer. There is no script to read ( the computer does all the narration!) it is animated and has two levels. Plus, students start out reading with regular looking letters from the beginning.Having used both programs extensively, I would try Funnix first!"
3,great book,"I LOVE the book's layout, but it wasn't in the shape as promised: bent up and had torn pages. I was disappointed."
1,Not for everyone.,"I was very impressed with the previous reviews of this book, so I thought I'd give it a try. Before purchasing the book, I decided to check it out from my local library. Am I glad that I did! The book wasn't so easy to follow and it seemed to require a fair amount of preparation ahead of time before presenting each lesson. I personally prefer a ""workbook"" type of layout so not only it will help me simplify presentation to my child but also I can readily work from the material with my child without much time spent in preparation. It's great that this book has worked for a lot of parents but it definitely didn't work for me."
4,I like this book,"I really liked this book, I was concerned about my abilty to teach my child the right way to read, I think parents should research the distar reading program before teaching your child to read form this book, I still believe phonics is the best."
5,Great Book,Great book! Our 4 year old daughter loves her lessons and she is already beginning to understand after only a few days.
5,Very effective,"I started this with my 4-yr. old daughter, in August. We went on doing 1 lesson everyday sometimes even 2 lessons in a day. When we got to lesson 45, we started skipping a few days off because she began to feel bored. But we kept on. Now we're almost half way done with the book and I am so proud of her. She reads on her own with very minimal help. I'm so glad that I came across this book here at Amazon. It's very fulfilling. I recommend this book to anyone."
4,Very Practical help,"I used this book to teach my daughter to read 25 years ago. Still being used by my grandchildren. Clear, easy and it works."
1,A total waste of money.,"As an ESL teacher of ten years I know a lot about teaching children. However when I had a daughter of my own I wanted to make sure that I had the best possible materials and approaches to teach her to read. Because of its high reviews and sales figures I purchased ""Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons"" by Phyllis Haddox. As soon as it arrived and I opened it I regretted my decision to buy this book. It should be titled ""How to Make Teaching Your Child to Read as Difficult and Boring as Humanly Possible."" Anyone who wants to teach their child to read should forget about this book and its useless program. If you want your child to learn to read, teach him or her some phonics, buy the ""Bob Book"" series and jump right in and begin reading."
4,Fantastic book.,"The book is so very easy to follow, not only for my daughter but for me as well. It also takes very little time to do each day."
5,Very Impressive!,"My son has very good language for his age of 4, but I wasn't sure how to go about helping teach him to read before entering school. I got this book and found that my son thought the lessons were extremely boring, so after about lesson 6, we stopped for a while. I've picked it up again however, because I feel it is that important, and this time Iuse bribes. We are at lesson 8 now. I have to say that I did not understand why the book was presenting the information the way it did, but now, I can see why they did. I see him using the technique when he looks at words. He just read the word bat, and cat the other day (still 4), and spelled ant to his dad and bee to me, from his head. I am excited to continue to see his reading abilities advance as we work our way through the lessons. Due to his lack of patience with an entire lesson, we usually do 1/2 a lesson at a time, but that's what works for us."
5,"Great Program, It really works!","Love this book! We are on lesson 13 and already my son who is only four can read quite a few words, and write quite a few letters. It is the same book our kindergarten we will be entering next year uses so we wanted to get a head start. Extremely well worth it. After we finish all the lessons he will be reading at a second grade level. Going into Kindergarten that is pretty amazing"
5,Fun and Easy,"This book is easy to understand. The lessons only take 15 - 20 minutes a day to present and build on each other. The writers warn don't skip ahead, there is a reason for so much repetition. If my child has difficult with one lesson, I go back to the previous lesson and review it then continue slowly on. You can set you own pace with this book."
4,It really works,"Despite the cheesy title, I decided to give ""Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons"" a try. My (average) child who just ""graduated"" preschool was headed to kindergarten in the fall. We started the book in the Spring. Since she was already familiar with the alphabet and letter sounds; we used the the 1st several lessons as review and to get accustomed to the format. The more difficult lessons took us 30-45 minutes to complete. By the time she went to pre-k summer school in June, she was reading simple books. Now, a couple of months into kindergarten, she reads more fluently and confidently. The teacher has advanced her to 1st grade reading class.This book is not particularly ""fun"" or exciting, and it did become a bit of a chore towards the end. But, it definitely worked for us."
5,Great even for children with learning difficulties,My son was almost held back from 1st grade for not being able to read properly. This is something he had been really struggling with to the point where he started to hate trying to read. He would get so frustrated and angry. We bought this book as a last hope. Meanwhile we took him to get a battery of tests and it turns out he has convergience deficiency which stops his eyes from properly seeing what he is looking at. He has been going to physical therapy for the eye issue but at the same time we have been doing his lessons. We are on lesson 89 as of today and he reads SO MUCH BETTER then he use to. he still gets stuck a bit with his eyes seeing other letters but most of the time his reading has become smooth. He doesnt fight about reading anymore. Its such relief and I know that when school starts up in a few short weeks he will be at or above the abilities of the rest of his class. I am so grateful that we decided to give this a try!
4,"It's just a ""get started""....","Although I've had success with this book, most people think this is a complete phonics program...it's not. It is a GREAT way to get your child ""off and running"" with reading. If your child has had difficulty with any other phonics program, use this to get them to start reading and then integrate back into your other program if you're happy with it. Most aren't structured to get them started reading, just to continue with reading. This book gets your child started and builds confidence."
4,These guys were so so so killer!,"Such a perfect band for Texas! Take equal parts Sabbath, Killdozer, Skynard and Weird Al and you've got Agony Column. I worshipped these guys from late 80s to early 90s. Live shows unparalelle and the production on the first two records was as heavy as you can handle. The first record God, Guns and Guts is, I think, far superior to Brave Words...but they're both good.Rock on."
3,Don't Rush and Buy,"This book took me a long time to really get into it, it was very slow and dragged on an then at the end it was like the author rushed the ending."
2,Could have been sooo much better...,"The author had a good story that was poorly executed. The book started off very slow, picked up and got me interested and then feel off. There's lots of drama, and interesting subjects but the ending is too ""and they all lived happily ever after"" Not one of my favorites; only worth buying if it is on sale."
4,Nice product,"I can't speak to the quality of the knives, as this was a gift, but they arrived as promised, looked nice, and were well received by the birthday boy. The box is a little light weight and ""cheap"" feeling, but if it is just used to get the knives to the shop (and then hung up individually as my friend did) I guess it's fine."
4,Pleasantly surprised how good these are!,"These aren't quite Sorby's but heck one Sorby chisel could cost you what this whole set costs. Since, we are comparing with other manufacturers these also are a HUGE step up from the HF ""red handled"" chisels that get fairly good reviews. These Benjamins Best are a bit more initially but since the HF set doesn't come with a bowl chisel it would end up being about the same cost.This Benjamins Best LCSIXW is really nice for the price. I am totally satisfied with the M2 HSS blades on these, they are nice and thick and hold an edge very well.The only weakness is that the handles aren't spectacular but they are serviceable and you could certainly turn your own handles and replace them if you chose. They actually have a nice feel to them but the fit and finish of the handles themselves isn't great. Again, more of a cosmetic issue than anything else."
5,High-end look at a bargain price,"I am in the home renovation business and I have purchased these fans for my last two project houses. They look higher quality than most of the fans sold at the big home improvement stores, but at a much lower price."
5,simply beautiful !,one of my favorite dvd titles. this title makes you relaxing all the way. beautiful again !
4,Sigh,"This, don't get me wrong, is a great Pocket Pc, but you will find that once you have bought it that there ARENT any extras avaliable YET for this model, this is because, although much like the 3000 models, it has one very large difference. The multipurpose port on the bottom of the PPC is flipped around, so, for instance if you were to plug the 1910 into a 3000 series keyboard, you would be facing the back of the PPC instead of the screen, this I find is a very frustrating set back because I would love a keyboard for mine!"
1,"PDA's are useless, this one is no different.","Really, do you need this thing? No, they are useless! Don't buy one! My god, my family must have purchased over ten PDA's in the last two or three years and they all found themselves sitting in the bottom of a drawer. They are just plain useless. GET A SIMPLE NOTE PAD FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!Unless, however, you are a major buisness man who needs his email on the fly. But if your not important, which most of you probably aren't (myself included) do not buy this POJ (piece of junk)!"
2,Could be a great product if it worked,The first unit that I received was replaced by HP Technical Support because it froze and required a reset almost daily. My second unit turns itself on for a reminder and never shuts off causing the battery to completely drain and erase all of my information and settings. HP Tech Support attempted to blame 3rd party applications for my trouble but I haven't even installed any Microsoft software. I am hanging in there with high hopes for the new version of Pocket PC.
1,Hardware Problems,"At first this worked great. Then I started experiencing image problems on the screen. Finally after a little more than a year, the iPAQ stopped working. I was in the middle of updating something when the screen went black and wouldn't change. I charged it although it was fully charged, and then it wouldn't turn off. Still, nothing on screen. Overall, I'm very disappointed. My next handheld will not be an HP."
5,Possibly my #1 favorite CD!,"I guess people have different opinions, but I totally disagree with the negative/indifferent reviews here. These are fantastic melody and feeling-driven songs and corny as it sounds, they convey real feelings which I feel I can relate greatly to. A great great great CD. It's doesn't sound hardcore indie (it's too melodic) but it's not mainstream pop either (from the subject matter <not dumbly optimistic> and the instrumentation, featuring Sam Coomes' Rocksichord?) :D I definitely recommend it."
5,They nailed it...,"Every track on this album is a brillant gem. I've been listening to ""Birds"" for over a 18 months and it still doesn't feel tired. Strong melodies over raw rhythm and bass w/ a super heavy dose of bummer (wink wink) lyrics is a treat for the ears. It truly is fun to listen to."
1,Dreadful,"All the Portland hipsters worship this band. Hipsters can be so stupid. Imagine some guy in his mid-thirties whining like a sullen teen-ager, over soulless music with a million pointless prog-rock changes that are meant to be clever, but aren't."
1,It's a dud for me,"I'm going to be honest. I don't believe pheromones really work. For those who are in 20's will not talk to you. All of them didn't show any reaction. It might work on people who are 30's or older, but not for young adults like college students. I really HIGHLY DOUBT IT."
1,Oops Solvent Not What It Used to Be,"I had been using Oops solvent for many years when it was made by RhodesAmerica and sold in pint cans. It was fantastic and removed every type of grease, gum, varnish, etc. without damaging plastic surfaces. Apparently the brand was sold to Homax Products and was reformulated. It no longer holds a candle to the previous version. It will not remove many greases and is almost useless, sorry to report. The product I am reviewing is labled as New, Stronger Formula. It needs reformulating badly, back to the Original 'All Purpose Remover' formula."
3,review,"it is an reproduction, good for showoff, no practical use otherwise, good price for quality received."
2,ruined my date ...,put 2 drops on ... and the girl I love and I were at each other the whole night. I couldn't figure out what was the problem. We usually are goo-goo eyes with each other. This stuff messed up my night pretty much.
3,Works for it's purpose,"After searching for years for a product similar to this that apparently no longer manufactured, I settled for purchasing this. My need for it is more cosmetic than physical. Due to a childhood car accident, I have a lot of scarring on one of my legs. This product is made of a thinner material than the product I used to purchase, which is nice if I am wearing it under another pair of stockings. But since it is more of a thick nylon stocking material, it is a bit see through, so some of the scarring shows through when I am wearing it alone. I am more concerned with the price. The product is absolutely over priced, there should really be 2 for that price."
5,Super!,"Oh my gosh! My daughter loves Tim Burton and when I saw this set, I had to get it for her for Christmas. It is very unique and a must for Burton addicts."
5,Absolutely charming,"I've bought this deck following my interest in the Celtic culture and I've found it to be absolutely fantastic.Pictures may look familiar to those people into cartomancy because they repeat those of the best know Rider Waite deck. Nevertheless this doesn't spoil the fascination of this deck.Images are carefully drawn and they are soaked with Celtic atmosphere. The Major Arcana depict the Gods of ancient Irish pantheon while the Minor Arcana tell the story of the four populations that inhabitate Ireland according to Celtic Myths: the horrible Phomores, the warrior like Ulaids, the ancient gods Tuatha de Danaan and the chivalrous Fianna.Since I bought this deck I've been using this only although I have many different decks. In addition, the cards are made of good and sturdy material so they can be used more and more times without getting damaged.The pack comes with a small leaflet that explains an alternative way to lay down the cards although I prefer using the usual methods."
2,Partly True,"The first half of David Holwerda's book was excellent, and he did a great job explaining from a covenant perspective how the church must be the new Israel. However, like so many, he took a wrong turn in the second half of the book toward a future fulfillment. Many commentaries and books on eschatology fall into this error because of the failure to understand that the new covenant was fully manifest after the destruction of the temple in 70 AD. Saying that, ""its full manifestation has been deferred,"" pg 105, is the same as saying that Christ work is incomplete, which is not a biblical teaching. I would recommend the book to Christians who want a better understanding of the church and Israel but be careful not to be led down the ""second coming"" will complete everything teaching. Jay Bugg"
1,Not one of the best,"There is not much romance in this book. It's all about sex. I was disapointed with this book. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind steamy sex scenes but I like for there to be a romantic plot going on also. Don't read this book unless you only want to read about sex."
5,I love Johanna Lindsey's books!,I can never stop reading a Johanna Lindsey book! I'm eagerly awaiting the next one!!!
4,Interesting but strange,This book was so weird. It almost felt like two different authors wrote the book. I was so disappointed with the first 1/3 of this book that I thought that I would give it 2 stars. There was rape but it was executed by a woman. Weird. The weird sex that continued after really turned me off. After about half way through it started to get better. It was just way too intense before that. Warrick was too nasty. Then all of a sudden you start to learn about all the nice things that Warrick had arranged and you kind of forgive him. Then it turns into a totally different book with two totally different characters who actually like each other. It was a very good and humorous read after that. All in all I didn't do any skimming and even when it was so intense and uncomfortable in the first half it was still very interesting.
4,Great historical romance,This is why you read a Johanna Lindsey book - it has all the drama and romance you expect to find. Perfect escapism reading.
4,Of Human Bondage,"Johanna Lindsey's tale of revenge, rape and romance starts off campy and ends up quite the way one would predict a book of this kind to end up. Though much of what happens is predictable, the writing was good enough to hold my interest. When I wasn't reading this book, I was looking forward to reading it, so that should tell you something.Lady Rowena and Warrick were good leads. I wished for their happiness (which is different than finding them likeable) and was all for the two of them ending up together. Yes, there is rape and pseudo-bondage taking place, which in real life would have provoked quite a different reaction from me, but here, done so campily, it was hard to take it seriously.So... standard stuff, done well. Romance fans not put off by the rape and bondage might enjoy this book."
1,hose timer for scientists,I spent one solid hour trying to program this timer. I never got it right. Finally used the timer for a daily 2-hose program - not what I wanted but all I could manage to program after an hour. DO NOT BUY this timer unless you want to be frustrated and disgusted!
4,works good for a while,"I live in the Caribbean and I have 5 Claber duplo to water the whole 2 acres. These timers work very good for 18 months to 2 years, and then suddenly, you hear a click at the programmed watering time, but no water comes out. It means I have to change it, because it cannot be fixed.The valve probably? It is expensive, but even though their life is short they are the best I could find. Easy to program, battery level, 2 separate times on the same water outlet, which allows to not take too much water at the same time from the same faucet/pipe and lack pressure."
5,Love my camera,I love all the features and have no complaints. I especially like that it doesn't use batteries because they tend to go through them so fast. I just charge it up and we are ready to go and take 1000's of pictures and not worry about anything. Displays are clear and it's easy to see when the battery needs recharging.
4,Great camera. Price is right for the value.,"This is a sufficient camera for the casual user. Some features were somewhat difficult to use, but the overall value is good. The price has been dramatically reduced since my purchase."
2,Takes too long to flash,I bought this camera last year for personal and business tasks. It does take crisp photos but it take way too long to flash and the subjects have to stand still long. I would not recommend it for sporting events or indoors or night shots.
1,Worst Camera ever!,Keeps intermittently turns off. Sometimes stays off days at a time. Customer support refuses to repair it even though I only bought it a 6 months ago. I don't have a receipt but most decent company will repair it by looking at the serial number of when it was built.
2,New Ladies of Country,This DVD is of a TNN show from the early 80's. I did not recognize anyone. It was at a theme park 'saloon' and was kind of a let down. I thought it was new ladies of country not ladies that were new 20+ years ago and have since moved on.I watched it with my wife (whom I bought it for) and was interesting. It will not be a DVD we will repeat watching very often.
3,Good But Not Great,"I'm a Photoshop Beginner and I've been using this book. It is good in that it assumes that you know nothing. However, it is incomplete. It does not have all of the illustrations on the enclosed CD. There are only maybe 10-20. The rest of the CD has a .pdf version of the book and a bunch of try-out products. I'm not interested in those. Second, it has very few projects--- do this, then do this, then do this. I believe that is how you learn a graphics program---by doing things, not by reading about them. He has illustrations of things he has done, but he'll say simply, ""I used the xxx tool to do this."" I would like more step-by-step instructions."
3,Black History: A Retrospective Review,"When I came across this DVD program I couldn't believe the price was so low. I could get so much black history for such a low price. This program is just a collection of old documentary put together. I think the Obama program was put together well. I really don't care about having three hundred hours of footage, but I just want the title and the program to match. Considering you get so much information for such a low price I gave it three stars."
1,Too Complicated,"I was looking for a book on preparing homemade baby food that was easy to read, straight forward and had simple recipes. This isn't it!I was very disappointed in this book. The chapters are not well organized and the recipes are far from simple. I found myself getting lost in the pages as well the ingredient lists. The recipes were unrealistic for our family. They are time consuming and the ingredients are not things we usually purchase (ie Lamb). The diary in the middle of the book which documents the feeding of their child from 6 months to 2 years old is completely out of place and a waste of space. Overall the book is not 'user friendly' and I would not waste my money on it.I would recommend ""Mommy Made and Daddy too!"" as a more pratical resource."
3,Summer Solstice,"the tape was of poor quality, short in scrip and appeared to be a copy of a copy with other videos added.."
3,Kindle Edition Review,"This is an excellent reference work, and I refer to it regularly during Bible class and other study. The write-ups are full of great information and well done.Unfortunately, the Kindle version's navigation features are almost non-existent. The table of contents does not let you jump to a letter of the alphabet and there is no search function (as there is in the dictionary included in the Kindle and other encyclopedias). You are left to page through one page at a time, or use the go to function and hope you get close to the desired topic. Your best option is probably to book mark every letter and use that as a means to more quickly get around.This is a very good book (I would give the print version five stars), but the Kindle version's lack of navigation makes it too cumbersome to use as a handy reference, which is what it is supposed to be. I recommend the hard copy of this work but caution those considering the Kindle version."
5,What can i say...,"Well if i were to sum up the band capdown in 1 word it would be....urgle.They are so mind bendingly amazing and i have seen them at 4 gigs. I will soon see them and cannot wait. The CD presents a variety of ska, punk and hardcore songs. They talk about how we destroy our world and how racists are wrong. The CD gives you a taste of capdown but to experience the band you must see them live. I would not hesitiate to buy the cd. The are a mix of catch 22 and sick of it allThe CD has all of my fave songs on it. CAPDOWN RULE"
2,Keep looking - the original stereo version is now on CD!,"I have to agree with some of the other reviews here. I'd be willing to bet this is the old quad mix, as others have suggested (this album was released in the heyday of quadraphonic sound back in the 70s), so it still has some value to hardcore Edgar fans (like me). But beyond that, this 5.1 (4.0?) mix is a disappointing version of an otherwise classic recording.But the good news is, the original stereo version is now available right here at Amazon.com (among other places) as a Japanese import from Sony Music, and it sounds wonderful! Woo Hoo! So keep searching (ASIN: B00005ULH5) - it's here somewhere, and it's worth the search! What a great album."
1,Horrible 5.1 mix,"Of all DTS 5.1 encoded CD's, this is by far the worst. There is no center channel or subwoofer signal...my guess is that, rather than remixing a 5.1 CD from an original 40 track master, this was cheaply lifted from an 70's era ""quadraphonic"" recording. As most 5.1 systems have small satellites for the four corner speakers, they can't handle bass at all. An incredible disappointment, the sound is horrible."
1,DTS- Not clearly marked,"I opened this product before realizing it was DTS and wouldn't play for me- a rip-off as fas as I'm concerned. These types of CDs should be VERY CLEARLY MARKED so there is no mistake about what the customer is buying. I was, and am, very unhappy."
5,Exceptional History,"This book is an extraordinarily readable version of a dark and painful period in American history. It is concise, personal, historically accurate, and, most of all, interesting. I found that I could not put the book down, something that usually occurs only with fiction. I highly recommend the text for anyone who is interested in America's early days. And if you have seen the PBS series, buy the book anyway. It is superior to the video."
1,I refuse to watch it! Zombie Hunters Vol 2,I can't give an honest review of this because I refuse to watch it. Vol I was torture enough. Just don't buy it! Save your $8.00!
1,Let's call a spade a spade,"I can't understand how anyone gave these speakers a favorable review. They manage to make the high, mid and low spectrum all sound awful. Thumping bass? Popping is more like it. They remind me of my first boom box back in the 80's. They ARE rumbling my desk, but I want good sound first and rumbling second. They do sound slightly better than my iMac's built in speakers - but how couldn't they? If you want to spend $20 for slightly more sound, then this is your product. You get what you pay for so please no more glowing reviews - they just don't make sense at this price level and some were so glowing that they suckered me into buying these. How about ""Replacement speakers for your broken internal speakers with a slight boost in bass."""
3,WARNING: Improperly shielded,"I've had these speakers for over two years now and they worked great. The sound quality is more than acceptable enough for basic uses. Well, they worked great until I moved. My new place just happens to be too close to a radio tower, and the improperly shielded wires or internal components only pick up the local radio station, not my computer audio.I'll probably pass them on to someone who can use them, but I am forced to purchase new speakers now. Kind of bums me out."
2,Big Mistake,"I played this gameboy game thinking it would be cool. I learned it was just a big mistake.Even on the easiest level scoring a goal is impossible. Getting the puck to the other side is tought enough. But scoring goals just wii not happen. If the other teams scores on you you know you've already lost.The games are tought to play. Fighting is hard to do because you have to memorize all the keys to hit.You can't trade players, and the goalies are way to good. Konami should make another hockey game but they should fiz the unpleastent game play.This game is good for people that want a really big challenge.But I've had he game for 2 weeks and I still can't win because of the oppponents goalies being way to good. Also their are too many buttons to memorize.Even hockey fanatics should aviod this big mistake."
5,Strongly recommend!,I would strongly recommend this game as one of the top hockey games available for GBC.....has the speed and action of blades of steel with the high quality graphics and realism of NHL 2000. It's the only handheld hockey game I'll play.
4,My Life As A Quant,Very honest biography something along the line of Andre Agassi's book but with an entirely different subject. Good insite into academic life.
3,How to forecast future value of Bond vs. Stock Price,"I wanted to have a quick read of this before venturing into his latest, less biographical, 'Models behaving Badly'. In about 2/3rd of the book Derman recounts his then boss' outburst on what the job of 'quant' entails - 'This job requires nothing more than addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. And, most of the times, you won't even require division'. Pleasant read, though a bit more leaning towards autobiography than to theory. The explanation on (a) 'Black-Scholes theory' and (b) how forecasting actual value of a Bond (will surely have a promised value) vs. Stocks with crisp graphs was a great takeaway, however."
2,I generally don't like to read reviews.....,".....I should've read the reviews before I bought it:Unless you are pursuing a physics orquant career or some derivative of themit, not enough to interest the mainstream financial community. As much as Derman talks about the mentality of traders or salesmen in his book, he did nothing to attract their readership with its content. Just as I think he's developing an interesting anecdotal moment that coincides with some notable market event, Derman succeeds in finishing his thought without a big finish.His info on Fischer Black was of interest."
2,Are you kidding me?,"I see all the praise for E-Man's work, and... quite frankly, I don't get it. This is the most incredibly self-absorbed work I've ever read. The book is a relatively dry retelling of Dr. Derman's career path. Along the way, he's over-eager to impress the reader with the depth and breadth of his undestanding of the world. Nothing, apparently, is ""hip"" until E-Man takes the plunge and does it himself. I can't even waste any more time writing this review. 2 stars is generous."
5,best hand cream I've found,"I love this stuff, it really soaks in and helps keep my hands from cracking and peeling... and its unscented so I don't smell like flowers"
4,Tres Flores Solid Brilliantine,"This item was ordered for a friend. Her mother enjoyed using it on her hair, and so does my friend. The product arrived quickly and in good condition."
3,"Not a bad CD, but not great.","If you are a hardcore Cars fan, then pick this one up (if you can find it). I wasn't overly impressed but there are bright spots. ""The Way You Look Tonight"" was a minor radio hit, and is a very pretty song."
2,Tiresome,"After reading ""McCarthy's Bar,"" I was looking for other books on Ireland before visiting the country. I picked up Irwin's ""In Search of the Craic,"" but put it down after a few chapters. To me, the book had a harsh and complaining tone about it that made Irwin's account unpleasant to follow. If you enjoy Irish pubs and Irish music, I would suggest looking elsewhere.If you enjoy Pete McCarthy or Bill Bryson, try Evan McHugh's ""Pint-Sized Ireland."" McHugh writes to a younger audience--20s and 30s--but still manages to provide an entertaining tale."

1,This is a duplicate release.....why bother?,"Same thing....different cover.Buy the previously released The Beach Boys ""Ultimate Christmas"" CD. It has all these songs plus the additional song ""Christmas Time Is Here Again""I rate THAT album 5 stars.No point in rating this album or buying it when the formal release is still available."
3,Christmas With the Beach Boys,I love the Beach Boys and grew up with their music while at the beach in So. Cal. The album has some good hits but when they decided to sing old Xmas songs not original scored by them I found it boring. Best to stick with their own scored music. This is what makes them the Beach Boys
3,A passable western,"The first reviewer is right. There is something wrong with sounds. The picture quality is adequate, however. The beginning is a bit slow and there is a lot of talk. The story is a rather complicated and a somewhat hard to follow because of the poor quality of sounds. There are a lot of familiar faces of the real B-films from 40's and early 50's, like Foran and Hatton. Lola Albright shines in a small role. I wonder why Scott chose Matthews and did not change her to Albright? She was really beautiful! I do not care Scott as a hero; I would rather see him as a baddie. Those who want to see Van Cleef will se him only very shortly. He is very effective though. I have seen much weaker films, but of course much better, too."
2,Not Bad,"This CD of Amber's greatest hits remixed is pretty good. I do have a few problems with it. First, all the songs are short, edited and not extended club mixes. Second, I have heard better remixes of THE COLOUR OF LOVE and LOVE ONE ANOTHER. The ABOVE THE CLOUDS remixes are horrible. TASTE THE TEARS was a pop song added to this collection but it is not a dance number. It is not bad, but sure could have been better for a remix CD."
1,Nothing special,"I am a big GFR fan and did not expect anything new from this collection. They even left out ""Inside Looking Out"" which was included on the previous version of this collection. Unless I'am missing something, the remastering is just fair. I will buy the new remasters that are coming out, but hope that the extra tracks included on them are worth it. If you must have a greatest hits package, try and purchase the Capital Collectors Series while it is still available."
4,When it is good it is good,"I found some of the selections on this CD to just rock. Others were dated, but that was expected. Overall I would recommend it for the hits."
2,Acting 5/Technique 1,"I had hopes for this series but was let down. I was willing to accept ridiculous plots in exchange for good acting and some archaeology. The plots were indeed ridiculous and the acting was fine. But their depiction of how archaeology is done disappointed. People picking up artifacts and carrying them off before mapping them in. No grid lines marking off units. No photography of artifacts in situ. And when they find the piece of cedar from the Holy Land infused with blood, nobody mentions that crucifixion was a common form of execution in that place, at that time? C'mon. I'll suspend a lot of disbelief and forgive a lot in the bargain, but this series really pushed me to the limit."
1,Truly Awful,"This is really a bad program,it got worse with each succeeding episode and I haveconsigned it to my pile of DVDs that will never be played again. The stories seemedlike they were written by grade school students with no knowledge of the subjectmatter and no hope of ever improving. This is the worst series I have ever seenfrom the usual excellent BBC."
2,Nasty,"I've recently decided to switch to eating whole grains and we picked up a box of this at a health food store as an alternative to the Kraft mac and cheese that my son likes. I prepared it as per the instructions and the sauce was runny and quite flavorless. After one bite my son wouldn't eat any more and after I had a bite too, I couldn't blame him because it was just nasty. I don't have any problems eating whole wheat pasta and neither does my son, but we couldn't eat this. I am a firm believer that food can be both healthy and delicious at the same time. This may be healthy but it is not tasty which means to me that it is not worth eating. Try the Hodgson Mills whole wheat macaroni and cheese instead. It is so much better."
2,there are better options out there,"I've bought many Annie's products, including another type of mac & cheese, so I was expecting to like this item as well. I eat whole grain pasta all the time and love it. With this product, I think it was more the cheese sauce than the pasta that turned me off. I found it watery and didn't think there was enough of it, although I'm not sure if having more of something I didn't really like would be an improvement.I'll stick to other kinds of mac & cheese and skip this in the future."
5,I Have the Cassette From 13 years Ago!!!,"I HAVE BEEN TRYING LIKE HELL TO LOCATE THIS BAND TO BUY THEIR CD!!!! What ever happened to them??? They fell off the face of the earth!!! They were actually very, very good!!!"
2,A NICE EASY READ,"THIS IS THE STORY OF DICK ALLEN, FORMER BASEBALL GREAT. DICK ALLEN DOES A NICE JOB COVERING HIS LIFE IN THIS EASY TO READ STORY. DICK DOES A NICE SHORT AND SWEET BOOK. THE HIGHLIGHTS WERE THE RELATIONSHIPS WITH CHUCK TANNER, GENE MAUCH AND MIKE SCHMIDT. I REMEMBER DICK BEING A VERY HUGE AND WELL BUILT PLAYER WHICH WAS A RARITY IN THE 60'S AND 70'S. I REALLY LIKED THIS BOOK AND RECOMMEND IT FOR ALL BASEBALL FANS WHO SAW DICK PLAY."
4,Route Newspaper holder,This is a very good item that is hard to find. If your newspaper will not furnish a replacement it is the way to go.Black Motor Route Tube (Newspaper Holder)
3,What you see is not what you get,The filter that I received it not the same as the picture listed. Although they have the same part number! The one that I received has a large seal ring that must be screwed on to attach the bowl and it is extremal hard to seal!
5,THE UNIVERSE IS NOW WIDE OPEN TO ME!,"MAGICK is something I have been into since I was a teenager. . . I was always lighting candles and trying to harness the power to evoke the spirits that surround us, but are mainly invisible until we are able to ""call them up"" to do our bidding.Well this book has worked wonders for me. I have successfully attempted at least a dozen of the spells which Dragonstar lays out in great detail.One for attracting a new lover did just that. Two days after I performed a love spell, my phone rang and it was this beautiful blonde I had met on the unemployment line. And speaking of unemployment, I also just got rehired at the compamy I got laid off from. Seems they couldnt do without my assistance in the office."
4,The Harris Formula,"Deuling divas, dudes with 'tudes, and NYC hot spots work well together (as usual) in this latest offering from E. Lynn Harris. This time the battle of good vs. evil takes place in the publishing world (rather than last year's music industry), and the focus shifts to Zelda and Raymond, while Yancey B. and Basil take a back seat playing the chorus role. The formula may be wearing out (this is my third Harris novel, starting back in 2000 with ""Not a Day Goes By""), but one must admit Harris is a master storyteller."
2,What Love got to do with it!,I have loved E. lyyn Harris since I first started reading him. It saddens me that this book did not live up to the rest but then I feel as he is moving into another direction with his readings and I am not following. I rushed out to get this book but will not when the next one comes out.
4,another winner!,"What is E Lynn Harris secret? How does he continue to crank out such magnificent fiction?I love the way Harris has gay and straight characters mixing it up, and how sexuality never eclipses the story line.I liked Zola, but I didn't feel loads of compassion for her plight. Zola brought many of her problems on herself.And Davis' background is the makings for a new book.Keep up the great work. Mr. Harris."
1,A Disappointment of My Own,"As a long time fan of the works of E. Lynn Harris, I must say I am throughly disappointed. The thready, weak plots were satiated with predictability; the novel (in its entirety) lacked realism. Previously introduced characters existed to no purpose, and brought no identifiable edge to the story. The new characters proved to be shallow and uninteresting. A futile attempt at rehashing sad, real-life events (9/11, Aaliyah's death) left me ultimately bored and a bit puzzled at their ill-placed presence in the story. The ""hurried"" appeal of the writing style suggests the lack of thought and effort denoted to the compilation of such a farce. The novel leaves much to be desired in comparison to Mr. Harris's previous novels. To the even remotely interested: Proceed with lowered expectations. Better yet, it wouldn't be a bad idea to just wait for its paperback release. This novel will wreak havoc on the inquisitive mind in search of true literary entertainment."
2,A Love Of My Own - Average At Best,"I rushed out to purchase A Love Of My Own in hopes that it would be an interesting page-turner. Unfortunately, it was not. As I read through this bland material, I wondered what happened to the passion and fire that raged through E. Lynn's previous novels.While I liked the themes of friendship and loyalty, the cursory mentions of previous characters and the implausible storylines involving Ava/Yancey (again!) and Trent were a bit much. Ditto for the repeated references to 9/11.E. Lynn is a fine writer and I hope he comes up with some fresh, entertaining material next time. A Love Of My Own fell far short of my expectations."
4,"This book is good, but could have been better","OK I have read ALL of his books and I will admit that I'm not totally disappointed but it could have been better. He kind of lost me with Zola and her resentment towards her sister. Then there was her friend Justine. And Basil, the one we love/hate to love/hate always has drama and I just wish for once that he would COME OUT ALREADY! The plots weren't like the ones I was used to; blackmail, shocking revelations, etc.He should have picked up where Yancey left off in the last book ""Any way the wind blows"" and her romance. I would have liked to see her find love again after Basil dumped her."
4,Great book,"A character in this book goes where you never think he will. Just that part of the plot alone is worth reading it. Very good read, Highly recommended"
1,about the game,"the game is not to great. turning around bombing the enemy. it, not so interesting for me.i have nothin to say about this game but dont buy it just rent it"
5,Big And Powerful,"This is one big heavy saw. It took me three to four hours to set it up after watching the video on the sliding table, the table saw is machined perfect and is very powerful, the five horsepower motor will run though any hardwood you can cut. I have installed a Forrest Blade on it. With the sliding table I can cross cut a full sheet of plywood by myself.I build a lot of cabinets and I need a saw that will stay where you put it, this one will not move with a sheet of 3/4"" plywood on it. The rip fence is strong and accurate. You want be disappointed with this saw, it is by far this best table saw on the market today."
5,A wonderful read,"Even though I rarely read historical fiction I have found that the novel: Code Name: Kris, is an amazing peice of work that I would most definently suggest to both friends and family."
1,poor quality,"I am surprised..I have their other products and I was always satisfied with the speakers I have received in the past. However, I received used speakers and the speakers did not work. I believe it was the co. that sold me the unit. I used this unit as batting practice since they would not give me a refund or return them for exchange."
5,one of the best,"I own the album, put out by Sheffield Labs, and always loved how it always tested my system. I must say that I didn't think the CD would be better, it is. All the small things you thought you heard on the album, are pronounced on the CD, and thats a good thing. Great CD!!"
3,An old book that's still OK,"I used this book 20 years ago when I started learning Thai. It was one of the only books available then, and was printed in the Thailand of 25 years ago, which is why other reviews have complaints about the fonts, etc. Nevertheless, I remember learning to read Thai quickly from the book and thought Allison's sequencing was good."
5,Pass it on,"My mother read this book to me a million times when I was a little girl. One day, I was telling my 4-year-old granddaughter to ""hurry up slowpoke!"" and it reminded me of this book. So I sat her on my lap and told her the story as best as I could remember it. Didn't little Simon cross a creek on his hat??She loved the story so I decided to see if I could find the book. I'm so happy to see it here. I'm going to order it and keep it for her grandchildren."
4,Item as expected,I found this item easy to assemble and sturdy once all the parts were in place. There is an option to put sand in the base which I didn't use. This box is the perfect size to sit under the shelves of my BBQ and therefore is under the cover in wet weather. I would recommend this box.
1,"Wow, what junk","Four people couldn't figure out how this was supposed to stay together. Nothing snapped into place, nothing held any part of it together. It just fell right back apart. We never could get the lid on either. I normally like Rubbermaid stuff, but this is a piece of junk. It's being returned."
2,Shipped Poorly,I bought this Item and I was suprised by how fast it was delivered but the Item was delivered in a cardboard tube that was too small for the banner causing the edges to get banged up pretty bad. I will edit this post when I find out what Skateboard.com does about this.
4,Easy installation,These headers fit perfectly. The directions supplied with them suggest jacking the motor to install the right side header but this is not necessary. Only took an hour to install. The mounting flanges are heavy and the welding is done well. The finish seems durable too.
5,Wonderful Architectural Resource,"""New Old House"" is an excellent resource for any architectural or interior designer that might be embarking on the renovation of an old house! Gorgeous photography and excellent text... I strongly recommend this beautiful book!"
3,back in time,"This book was very interesting to look at. The pictures were great if you like old style homes. The title is deceiving. I was looking for a more modern looking style but this book is still a looker but if you're looking to modernize an old home, I would recommend Colonials: Design Ideas for Renovating, Remodeling, and Building New (Updating Classic America) by Matthew Schoenherr."
5,Great album,"Yes, it is a Christian album, but dont let that scare you if you are a non-christian backstreet fan; it is a very good album, all around. It can help you recover your faith at times when you feel lost, and it will be more enjoyable if you have the same beleifs as Brian. But, even if you dont, you will probably like some of the songs (for example, ""Im Alive"", great pop song). Rcommended because i find it very admirable that a high-profile pop singer has the courage to release an album about what he believes in. 5 Stars. Favorite tracks: Welcome Home, Gone Without Goodbye, I?m Alive. Thank you Brian, you have helped me restore my faith."
3,ALSO CHECK OUT.......,I LOVE MY MAN.I HEARD IT WAY BACK IN THE MID 90'S AND DIDN'T KNOW WHO SANG IT.
2,"Cheap material, doesn't fit very well","You get what you pay for, these were cheap sheets and they feel like it. They are also very skimpy with the amount of material. The bottom sheet barely fits the bed. The top sheet hardly has enough material to tuck into the bottom of the bed."
5,Works as advertised,"Pretty easy to set up, the only issue I had is my TV box always outputs a signal, even when off. Fortunately, the documentation tells you the priority of the input ports so I was able to put it at the lowest priority input and it automatically switches to any other device that gets turned on."
4,Works Perfectly,It switches automatically between any device that is turned on most recently. So if I'm watching the satelite and I turn on the Wii it will switch to the Wii automatically. Then if I turn the Wii off it will go back to the satelite. Very smart box. The only bad thing about it is it uses these little suction cups on the bottom of the unit to secure it to a surface. This might be ok but the suction cups pull out of the mounting on the bottom. So I ended up putting mine on its side in the back since we really dont need access to it to change the inputs.
3,ATTENTION: Great band has better albums...,"This is the third release from a great unsung band from the late 70's. More pop sounding than there stellar first two releases, this album laid the blueprint for the pop-metal sounds of Poison/Cinderella/Bon Jovi that thrived in the 80's. If you own the debut and ""Violation"" and gotta have some more-go for it. It is worth it just for ""More Ale We Seek"", though there are a few ""cringe inducing moments"", all in good fun though. A band worth checking out for retro rockers, start with earlier releases."
3,okay...but very narrow seat,I bought this stroller for quick trips to the store. It was okay for a while...but as my son got a little bigger he started to look really uncomfortable in it. He couldn't take a nap and he really just didn't enjoy it at all. It was a good value...and for a smaller child it's fine but if you are planning on using it for a toddler I wouldn't recommend this stroller.
2,Try Before You Buy,"This stroller is very nice and sporty looking. Very compact and very light. However, all of these nice qualities do not mean anything unless you child is slim enough to fit in the seat. My 10 month old who weighs 18lbs was too large. His shoulders were just narrow enough to fit, but the seat is not deep enough to keep him from sliding out. Unless your child is wearing a rough material type pant, s/he will just slide out of the seat. I ordered online, so I could not discover this until after I purchased the stroller. I ended up returning it. You really must try this seat before it. Otherwise, there is a good chance you'll have to return it."
3,Reason why I didn't buy this stroller...,"When I first saw this stroller at the store, my 20-month-old daughter wasn't with me. I did, however, push it around and liked the build of the frame, the grippy tires & the handles. The height of the stroller or walking room behind posed no problem for me. The price, of course, was unbeatable, so I read some online reviews and thought it best to try it out with her in it. This stroller, for all it's good points (and I truly believe there are!), is just too small for my toddler. When she sits in it, the edge of the seat doesn't come close enough to the back of her knees, so if she wiggles around at all, her bottom falls out of the chair, and is then left to balance herself on the footrest & held in (rather uncomfortably) by only the seatbelt.Try it out first, if that's all possible."
2,Not Comfortable For a 24 Pound Toddler,"I bought this umbrella stroller for my 20 month old son, who's 24 pounds. The stroller is not wide and deep enough for my son to fit comfortable in it. He looks like he's wedged into the stroller with no space on either side for his arms. The stroller doesn't come with any cup holder or storage net. I wish I had read the specs and accessories before I purchased it. I think this stroller is ok for a smaller child and should only be used for short strolls."
4,Pretty Good,I really like this stroller because it's a lot sturdier than the really cheap ones. It's a little narrow but it maneuvers easily and I can take it anywhere. It's worth the money.
4,Very pleased with this stroller,"We really like this stroller! The ONLY problem that we've had with it is that it is a little difficult to walk behind--I sometimes keep kicking it when walking and that can get a little old at times. However, overall, we love it! I kind of wish that it had a little basket in the bottom for storage, but it is just an umbrella stroller and we just hang our bags on the handles and keep going! I like that the little shade cover swings all the way down in front of the baby...when walking in the evenings at sunset, this is a great thing if the sun is right in front of him! He's very comfortable in the stroller (4.5 months old) and right now with it being so hot, it's nice that it has a ventilated seat-back! We'd definitely recommend it!! Well done, Jeep!"
1,Going on my second one!,"This is a nice stroller for an older child such as mine who is 2.5. However, the place where she rests her feet tore off of the first stroller, then I exchanged it for the second (current) one and I now want to get rid of this stroller!I really don't like the foot rest on this stroller as it can easily tear and rip off if your child presses to hard on it.I also don't like how there is no recline for my daughter to really rest her neck."
3,SCC Best of Could Be Better,"Don't get me wrong-- I love practically every song I've ever heard written by Steven Curtis Chapman. The problem is not with his artistry-- that as always is exellent-- the problem is in the packagaing and marking of this disc. Yes, it is a low-cost collection of the ""best"" of his first two albums, with great music, but a lot is missing. The packaging is very poor. There isn't even one photo of Steven. This isn't just a problem for those starry-eyed female admirers, it's a problem for any buyer. Many CDs sell based on their visual appeal alone-- any marketer would agree-- and many also sell because of recognition. Browsing the isles of the CD store and you can't remember the guy's name? A picture is tremendously helpful here. No liner notes or words are included either-- something I always look for when I buy the CD. If you're a fan and want to add someof Steven's old stuff to your colection, this is a great disc, but don't look for anything special in the packaging."
4,Callan,"Great show, I'm glad to have these episodes in my collection. It was an interesting series. The quality was pretty damn good. If you buy these DVDs maybe Amazon will add more Callan episodes to its' catalog. It is was nice discovering these DVDs, I have been an Edward Woodward in The Equalizer. Mr. W does a great job in these DVDs. Buy this set and you will like it."
2,Too Much Filler Very Little Substance,"2/3 of this book is filler material - the 1st 3 chapters gives general overviews about STM, the Appendix is like the last 25% of the book. Absolutely zero coverage on how to implement custom parser functionality (needed if you have a device that doesn't have built-in support under MARS). Useful only as a basic starting point reference, but not worth the price tag. Indicates that another book on MARS will be produced - maybe that is why the content has been watered down."
3,Not an Easy Read,The book is informative but I found it a difficult read. Its as if the author got too bogged down with detail. Its a hard book to start and stay with it.
5,Luvs Diapers are great !!,"The product is good and the price is reasonable, I never got a leak with this one. It 's OK to order it here with free shipping, but if you want to save extra bucks, get it from BJ 's, it 's 5 bucks cheaper."
5,"Great value, especially thru Amazon!","These diapers have worked just fine for us--hardly ever any leaks. I could do without the baby-powder smell, but it doesn't really bother me. Best of all, the big box qualifies for Amazon's Super Saver shipping. And while sometimes the Super Saver option has caused delays of MONTHS for books and DVDs, so far the diapers have always arrived within the week. Great deal! No shipping fee, no lugging them to and from the car, and hardly any waiting. Thanks, Amazon!"
3,Not Worth It Really,"This compilation of Janet Jackson's hits is not really worth the money, unless you are just a casual fan looking to discover more about this artist. The songs on here come from her albums CONTROL and RHYTHM NATION 1814, and a few extras like ""That's The way Love Goes"" from JANET. and a few new tracks. ""Runaway"" is a nice, fun kind of song, but the real gem is the other new track ""Twenty Foreplay"", very sensual and erotic. But in all honesty this collection is not worth owning if you already own CONTROL and RHYTHM NATION 1814, you already have those hits from there on those cd's, so why buy this if you already have them? For the new tracks I guess."
3,Its definately Not Opera,"Tis quite hard to explain what this album sounds like,Its Black,its Heavy,its Diverse,Its Fronted by a female vocalist who could probably kick my ass and its worth paying for.The band is still together but vocalist cadaveria has now left and is a band named Cadaveria."
4,Fine,"This kettle is just fine. I bought it for my son (25) because he wanted ""the same one we had growing up."" It is the same. It heats up just fine and operates just fine; no leakage. It's thin and light. It's not a fancy heavy-weight one you'd want to show off but that's not why I got it."
3,They SURE DON'T Make Them Like They Used To!,"They SURE DON'T Make Them Like They Used To! We bought this one to replace an ""identical"" one purchased 30 years ago which unfortunately I melted on the stovetop. The new one has replaced the handle and the spout with some kind of cheap flimsy modern plastic instead of the historical bakelite such that the new stuff melts if you let is whistle for more than a few seconds. Now the spout looks like is has formed some kind of cancer! Also the new plastic conducts the heat more so you always burn your hand. SOMETIMES, the OLD WAY is the BEST WAY!"
3,handle gets too hot to handle!,"I've had this teapot for 6 years and it is good to a point. It boils water fast, has a loud enough ""whistle"" so that it can be heard from any room...however, don't lift it off of the stove without using a pot holder! the UNDERNEATH of the handle is extremely hot to the touch. I don't know if they've improved on the handle over the past 6 years, but the one I have you must use a pot holder to hold the tea kettle. I'm looking for another one that doesn't get a hot handle."
5,I love this teapot!,"I have this teapot in my northern home. I finally decided to order one for Florida. I love the Revere teapot...nice size, looks good on a black-top stove. I like the fact that you can raise the whistling arm so the pot of water can continue to boil without all the whistling noise!I have had my first teapot for years. The quality is great. I would definitely recommend it to anyone and will purchase it again if needed."
2,Perfect for 2 years,"I have owned this kettle for 2 years, during which time it held up wonderfully to the rigors of family life. However, today the plastic ring on the handle broke off under normal use. I thought that I would be able to replace the entire handle as it has screws and would be an easy job for me. After an exhaustive google search it seems like the part is just not available. This is ridiculous. Planned obsolescence? Perhaps. But if you are like me and care for the planet and do not want to throw away a perfectly good teakettle because you can not find a replacement handle then you may want to research another kettle, which is where I find myself. This kettle was made in China, perhaps there are replacement parts there. Good luck."
1,Arrived broken,"The plastic on this item is not very sturdy and the lid thatopens has a piece that has come apart after taking out of thebox, have not even used one time. May send back."
2,Will buy a different one next time,"I bought the smallest version of this kettle a while ago. It's nice-looking, small and light. I only use it occasionally, boiling water to clean my cast iron skillet, etc. But I still find some major problems of this pot.The first problem is you can only fill in water through the small hole where you pour water out. Unless you fill it directly under a faucet, you're likely to spill a little bit (like me, using a brita.) There is no lid of this kettle, which means you basically can't see the inside very well. I don't know how I can easily clean the inside either.The second problem is the handle gets very hot if you boil a full kettle of water. Can I wear those heavy kitchen mitten? Yes, but I also need to use one finger to pull that hook (under the handle) back so as I can pour water out. It's not an easy job, believe me."
2,"Boo, leaky kettles","I really like the design and how fast this kettle heats up, but it immediately started leaking where the copper bottom meets the wall of the kettle. I don't want to have to clean up a mess every time I make tea!=("
1,Toxic odor,"I grew up with Revere Ware, but I was very disappointed with this tea kettle. It had a toxic odor and taste even though I washed it with soapy water, and boiled it with vinegar. I was displeased to see if was manufactured in China, which has horribly lax environmental safety standards."
1,Non-whistling whistting tea-kettle,I had much higher hopes for this tea-kettle. Unfortunatelly I was disappointed.The whistling volume is so low that I can only assume that it wasn't tested at the factory.Another minus is that while the water heats up the tea-kettle stars rocking as thebottom is not completely even. I've replaced it with a 10$ kettle and couldn't be happier.
5,Terrific kettle,"My wife and I got this for my father-in-law after he had suffered for months with a leaky kettle. Good capacity, well constructed, nice copper bottom. Should last him a long time."
5,Nice little teakettle,"After reading all the mixed reviews I have to add my two cents.I too remember this teakettle from my past. I haven't had a teakettle for many years and I recently decided I wanted one. No matter how hard I looked, I could not find something I really liked.I even bought one at a local store and because I wasn't 100% happy with it, I kept the receipt and I kept it in the box. While browsing Amazon I discovered the Revere teakettle, read the reviews and took a chance.I am very happy. No leaks, it fits the small burner on my electric stove perfectly and I returned the one I bought locally.Respectfully submitted,John"
3,Too Hot To Handle,"The size of this kettle is fine as is the quality. What I don't like is that the handle is set too close to the top of the kettle. You must use a pot holder to pick it up and pour as the handle gets hot. But with a pot holder in your hand it gets very clumsy to pour. Also, there is very little space between the holder and the top of your fingers. I found my fingers brushing the hot kettle top when pouring. Ouch."
1,CHEAP--DON'T BUY!,"Seriously, I rarely take time to write these and this item is being shipped straight back to amazon, but this is a really bad product. I am NOT very picky, but merely wanted a low cost stainless steel teapot--no other big priorities, but this is even too cheap for me. The plastic top is an absolute insult--bet it wouldnt' last a week. And the bottom does NOT look to be stainless steel on the inside which was my main reason for replacing my old (cheap) teapot. It will cost about 6$ to return so there is a negative cost/economic consequence of ""trying it."" I can't imagine anyone would be happy with this product."
5,Revere copper bottom tea kettle - THE BEST TEA KETTLE EVER MADE!!!,"This Tea Kettle is the best!, My Mother had a copper bottom Revere Kettle, and this is my second one.Heats water quickly, and has a traditional ""whistle"" when water is ready. Classic style, every kitchen should have one!They are also indestructible - and the stainless steel/copper construction conducts heat and is very healthy - no worries as with aluminum."
5,Paul Revere Kettle,I love my Paul Revere Kettle. I have been looking for one that would whistle loud enough for me to hear if in another room and that the handle would not get burning hot while heating the water. This is the one. You need to keep the flame lower that the rim of the kettle so the handle is touchable.
1,Do not buy this product,"We had a Revere Tea Kettle for over 20 years. Finally, the trigger broke so we ordered what we thought was a new and identical version. Pure junk. Thin, cheap steel and copper made in China. Worse, it leaked all around the base where the steel meets the copper. We returned it and got a replacement (just a bad example of a great product - right?) and the second one leaked worse. And, we bought a smaller (2 1/2 Quart) one for my in-laws - and it leaked around the base. Revere Tea Kettles shold be avoided.This is not Amazon's fault - it's just another example of ""Made in China"" ruining a great brand.We checked reviews and bought a BergHOFF 11 Cups Whistling Tea Kettle - THAT is very high quailty and exactly what we wanted."
1,revere tea kettle,"Did not like this product. The plastic where you hold to open the tea kettle to pour is very cheaply made. It is also hot. No, I don't like this product."
1,tea pot,Not so good. The piece that makes it whistle fell off after second use. It will not stay on. Not happy with this item
4,The tea kettle is well made & very satisfactory.,"We had an electric kettle. Someone placed it on the stove burner, so I bought the Revere Kettle. T'is very effectant."
1,NOT the tea kettle you grew up with,"I bought this tea kettle in hopes of getting a duplicate of the revere we had when I was growing up. This is not it. It is constructed of flimsy feeling sheet metal, the copper bottom is thin, and the plastic handle is not of the same construction as they used to be (70s,80s). If you buy this having used a similar kettle in the past, you will be disappointed."
4,Revere is still relevant!,"This is a good item. We needed something that can heat water for hot beverage and out old Revere broke after 30 years so we bought Revere again and are not disappointed! Seems to be well made, will write again in 30 years:)"
2,Boils fast but this is a flawed kettle,"Well reviewed on amazon but this kettle is lacking. The copper does, indeed, boil water fast; and that's the job of a kettle, I admit. However, the button/trigger that opens the spout is too close to the steam and you're forever guarding your fingers and shying away from the kettle. As you tilt the kettle to pour, you're also tilting the steam nearer to your fingers. It's uncomfortable at best and searing at worst.While you learn how to not get scalded, this kettle is always at least slightly irritating. There are better kettles around."
4,not must on the whistle!,"It's a great kettle, nice looking, copper bottom for fast, even heating. It prevents the water from boiling off. Yet the whistle is barely there. You have to be right there to hear it.As one who tends to be preoccuried, I have hope for a louder whistle."
1,Revere Whistling Tea kettle,"An oldie but goodie, this tea kettle is great for any type of stove. Easy to clean and maintain, it coordinates well with many of today's stainless kitchen appliances. The whistle is a great reminder it's time for tea!"
5,Back to basics,I have gone through many more expensive fancier tea kettles and this is my favorite. For many years I made coffee with a Chemex pot and now I am a tea addict. This kettle does its job very well. It has a large flat bottom that heats water up very fast. It has a reliable whistle that is attached so I don't misplace it in my kitchen or burn my hands using it. That is handy for me when using an electric stove which doesn't cool down instantly. It is easy to rinse out with no enameled inside to corrode over time. We use one regularly and neither me nor my husband who has large hands have any problems with it.
5,Love my new Revere teakettle,I love this kettle and I'm very satisfied with this purchase. I researched many kettles and was willing to pay more. It holds plenty of water so it's great when you have company. It heats quickly and looks good. The whistle is loud. Can't get your hand in there to clean it but you can just rinse it with vinegar and baking soda once in a while. Handle does not get hot. I highly recommend it for the price - just wish it were made in the good ole USA.
1,Not Revere Quality,"When my existing Revere tea kettle handle broke, I ordered this item thinking it was the same. It is not. What I received was thin-walled, poorly made, cheap Chinese crap. It does not deserve the Revere brand. The handle on this kettle is flimsy molded plastic (not the solid resin of previous kettles). The finger trigger is loose and feels like it will break easily. The steam vent lid doesn't fit securely on the spout. If you're a fan of Revereware, do not by this product, or you'll be sorely disappointed."
3,Not like it used to be,"I have always like Revere and chose it for my teakettle. I was disappointed in the new product. The mechanism on top is very cheaply made and is not at all sturdy. After the water boils the handle gets much to hot to handle, I must get a oven mitt most of the time in order to pour the water out. The metal body also seems to be a bit thin, I wonder how long it will take to eat through.It is functional right now but I feel cheated by this company, they should make a better pot and charge more for it and keep your name in tact.Companies today are too worried about making their products for less, don't they realize if they make a great product that lasts, and yes, may cost more we are willing to pay for quality."
1,Oh God no,"Please oh please read another Bible. I don't hate this ""translation,"" I really don't. And if it brings somebody to Christ, then who cares what I rate it. But seriously, I have never cringed so much reading anything before. The great thing about the Bible is that it can be understood through its already fantastic simplicity--parables involving such easily comprehendible things as bread and water, for example--that they really don't have to be re-written so drastically as they are in The Message. And isn't the setting and diction of Christ and his work what makes the Bible such a fantastic literary work? I'm probably just old-fashioned; for every person I know who dislikes The Message I know five that find it wonderful. Personally, I recommend you look it over before you buy, and make sure that if you do purchase it, it's not the only Bible in your library."
5,good to the bone!,"Costless and very helpful. It uses a clear language that prevents any misinterpretation in behaviour and handling of ships to occur. Check its pretty neat index and you can see many of the information it has inside. In my opinion, better than Daniel H MacElrevey on its concerns. Enjoy! (by 2nd Mate Gignon)"
5,Classic,"A brilliant collection of gags, wheezes and wind-ups, written in a fluid classic style. Must have been a large effort to collect all the stories included, many of which will have you laughing out loud. Every person alive should own this book, it's that good. Superb."
2,Good shaver -- while it lasted!,"I have had my Braun 5 (now the 8985) for over a year. The IDEA is great! One push of a button and the razor gets cleaned and charged. The shave is also good. Noise level is not bad. The problems came when the silver finish started to peel off. I called Braun and they said that the ""cosmetic"" features were not covered by warranty. Today, the shaver started making a very, very loud raspy sound as if someting inside was grinding. I take that to mean that it is not much longer for this world!I am considering giving Braun another chance with another model (perhaps with its Series 7 - 760 cc) but I'm not sure. I would hope that the shaver would last for longer than just a year!!!!"
4,"DDR - awesome in Japan, awesome in the US","Once again, Konami has created one of the best games not only for the arcade, but for a home-console. This game has had me feeding dollar after dollar in the machine at the arcade and really putting a gash in my wallet. But thanks to AMAZON.COM's low price on DDR, i have been able to play it at home for less than the arcade. This game has also been helpful in getting a good aerobic workout. One downside to this home version is its memory capacity. It doesnt have all of the songs i had hoped. That's why i gave it 4 stars."
4,Great for people who don't have mod chips,"Many people have complained that this is a ""watered-down"" version of DDR because it doesn't have some of the best songs, like Butterfly and Dam Dariram on it. Liscensing issues are unfortunate, but the fact is, this is the best way for someone who doesn't have a mod chip (such as myself) to practice DDR at home! Sure, it may not have Captain Jack or Mr. Wonderful, but it DOES have Boom Boom dollar, both mixes of Brilliant2u, smoke, Dub I Dub, 3 mixes of paranoia, La Senorita, Afronova, Dynamite Rave and more! Great for a beginner, or anyone who feels like they need a patch or gum for DDR ""withdrawals""Pros:+Great fun+Great exercise+Perfect for parties+Large amount of enjoyable music+One of the best damn games you can buyCons:-You pretty much NEED to buy a pad for maximum enjoyment (you can order one from redoctane.com)-You're going to need to tape the pad to the floor, otherwise it's gonna slide all over the place-Missing a lot of good songs"
5,The Best Game on Play Station!! : - D,"THIS IS THE TIGHTEST GAME ON EARTH!!!!! The best I've ever seen since Vurtural Roller Coasters! Bad thing is, you lose weight over it. Don't get me wrong, it is an awesome game, but I'm a 10-year-old that weighs 67.5 pounds! Now I'm wating for the Disney Mix..."
4,ouch,"My boys have pinched their finger so often, they hate to play with them. They are ages 2, 4 and 6. They concept is great and I love building with them. I hope as they get older, they will be played with again."
1,"Product Damaged, No Refund Received","This product arrived damaged. After contacting seller (SHOEBACCA), they agree to send me a prepaid postage label. I returned the product on August 8 with all original packages, tags, etc. but I have not received my refund even though I have contacted seller (Mary Rivas from SHOEBACCA) several times. Please help me obtain my refund ($39.00).Thanks,Erki"
1,Not woth the $,"The author of this book is a paranoid man with delusions of grandeur. Their books seem to spend more time talking about how amazing he is (making such claims as being able to levitate and summon ufo's on a whim) and doesn't actually give any real evidence. You are better off looking for interesting evidence with a google search, this book is not worth the money."
1,The Distorted Americans,"I found The Inscrutable Americans to be at times amusing and funny. However, I believe that there was a fuzzy line between the main character's innaccurate views on Americans attitudes on sex and the author's descriptions of Americans. This is a very dangerous mistake to make. I am currently travelling in India with a female friend and we have encountered countless Indian men who believe that American women are very free with their sexual behavior. My friend has been verbally harassed hundreds of times in the last three months, and has been sexually assualted eight times. The Inscrutable Americans only contributes to this dangerous misconception of American women."
2,Not anywhere close to the original cast,"To reiterate what was said below, this is NOT the original cast or anything close to sounding like one. This is evident from the opening track, when the singer of Rafiki sounds suspiciously like the singer of the child simba (!) right on through the inauthentic sounding chant tracks. The harmonies have been made harsher, and the sound generally grates on the ear throughout, even when the singers aren't horribly mangling the notes or text.It isn't quite deserving only of one star (in part because the genius of the show's music still shines through in places, in part because a few tracks aren't all that bad), you still should banish all thought of purchasing this CD from your mind."
2,"Too much burn, Smells like pure rubbing alcohol.",Way too much burn for me! Feels and smells like regular rubbing alcohol going on. Guess I will stick with straight up witch hazel (14% alcohol).
1,Too old,The hand cream was so old it had lost it's lavender fragrence. But worse than that it had changed to a foul smell. I had to throw it away.
3,Portrait of Hemingway,Interesting book based on a New Yorker article by Lillian Ross about Ernest Hemingway in his later alcoholic fueled years. Set over the course of one day in New York.
4,The Invincible Ramage,"This novel in the Ramage series provides another twist to the exploits of the good Captain. While sent to patrol and seek out pirates and privateers in the souhern carribean, he captures a French frigate and discovers a tempting opportuntityon the Dutch island of Curacao. Finding the island on the verge of anarachy, threatened by angry privateers and rebellious locals, he accepts the surrender of the island so that he may try to save it from disaster. The story moves quickly and maintains interest right through the treacherous conclusion. One of the better novels in this series."
2,Disappointment City :(,"Well, I've gotta say that I was hella excited about the Smash Pak when I saw it on Amazon the other day; it was a great excuse to break out my Dreamcast again, right!In a word: No. No, it wasn't. It's a great idea on paper, but the sound reproduction is astoundingly bad. I actually compared several of the games on the disc to the originals, and there are missing sounds, added sounds (what's with the ridiculous ""boing"" noise when you hit the jump button in Streets of Rage 2!?), scratchy samples/noises, horrid music that, in some cases, has different notes and sounds than the originals.The graphics are fine, and appear to be pretty much perfect, however, an option for bilinear filtering or interpolation sampling to clean things up a touch would've been nice.I suppose there are probably worse ways to spend [...]."
4,Great close to a great music career.,"I knew that this CD was being released, but I hadn't realized it was their last till after I bought it. With that said, now I look back and see that it does indeed cover their career from 3-chord pop/punk band to a more sentimental sound, not unlike some mid-Radiohead.The first song is my favorite of the new ones, ""Scared of Me"". I just love the lyrics as well as the vocals. Don't get me wrong, I'm definately a fan of the earlier Siletta punkish vocals, but I think Eric Balmer really comes into his own with this stuff. Honestly, I think they should have probably dropped the Plankeye name when Siletta and Ferry left. It's a shame that the two replacements (can't remember their names) only did one full album, ""Strange Exchange""...although I'm not sure if they played on ""Relocation"" and just didn't get band credit.But who cares? It's a great album. I'm not too fond of the new versions, but they have their place. It's fun to re-record old favorites."
2,Lots of stuff to lose and toy is no good,My son got this for his christmas present and I was fairly disappointed in it. He grew bored fast and lost all of the toys in a matter of days. It's also not very sturdy either kept falling on him. And the red door kept pinching his fingers.
5,The Best MONEY CAN BUY!!!!!,"My son received this workbench for Christmas a year ago and STILL plays with it every day! It is durable for all day, multiple childrens play. The ""sounds"" are from the little screws and not annoying like some other toys....I listen to it all day and it doesn't bother me! A real plus for the toy!A drawback for this bench is the top area that holds tools is not big enough! We have several additional tools and its difficult to keep coralled in there, but the tools it originally comes with fit nicely. This is the one toy we will not ""phase out"" this Christmas....he love it too much! An excellent purchase for boys and girls, we highly recommend it!"
3,Not as much fun for my son as expected,"I thought my son would enjoy this toy more than he does. He was about 14 months old when we bought it for him. He is almost two now and does still play with it some, but I don't think we got our money's worth out of it. We periodically have toddlers over and none of them have ever played with it for very long, either. This toy is somewhat educational with the shapes and cause/effect features (ball drop and drill press with handle to release balls) but it does not stimulate my son's imagination like some of his other toys (not that I really expected it to, but that is why I only gave it 3 stars for educational value). The quality of this toy is very good and the small amount of assembly was a breeze."
4,Fun for toddlers,"My son loved this when he was a toddler; I would disagree that it's up to 3 years old, though. He pretty well lost interest in it around the time he turned 2. All in all, a nice toy, though."
2,not worth the money,We bought this for our son when he was 9 months old. It looked like a lot of fun and seemed fairly durable. He enjoyed it for a couple of weeks until he figured out how to lift the green battery compartment portion off of the work shop (then he got upset because he could not get it back on). We constantly had to put it back together and he did not want to play with any other parts once he could dismantle it. Now the toy just collects dust. It would have been a great toy if they could find a way to fasten that portion of the toy on so that children could not just pull it off. Maybe then he would have wanted to play with the other parts. Also he was able to easily pull it over on himself and he could not even stand at the time. I would not recommend this toy at all. buy some plain stacking cups and small containter instead.
3,Good Toy!,"We bought this last year for my son's first birthday and he has really enjoyed it. He loves to pull the handle down and watch the balls come out and carries around the hammer all the time. It is VERY durable. He has climbed on it, knocked it over, sat on it and it still looks brand new. Still interested in it a year later, so I'd say it was a good purchase."
5,Great toy!,I bought this toy for my son's first birthday and he ADORES it. He'll sit for ages and play with it. I can see him enjoying it for quite a while in the future.
1,Piece of JUNK!,"I purchased this toy for my son's 1st birthday. He received it on Wednesday evening and was pretty entertained. However, the very next day, the sounds stopped working. We've tried everything, including new batteries and it still does not work. One of the balls also deflated (my dog picked it up however we've never had this problem with balls that go with Fisher Price toys). I've emailed Little Tykes so we will see what they do. I can't return the toy because the box was trashed over the holiday."
3,Fun while it lasted,"This toy was a favorite for a very short while. At fist my son was very interested in this toy, and then grew tired of it. When he does play with it now (a year later) he uses other toys with it. I found like all toys with pieces and balls, they tend to go missing. I read a review that suggested filling the toy with sand to keep it steady and this was a great idea. He had a ball blaster from Fisher Price which was by far superior to this toy at around the same age. I probably wouldn't buy this toy again, simply because it didn't hold his attention for long. The part he liked best was the ball chute and you can buy better toys with that feature."
1,Confusion!,"I still don't know how to pack this thing properly, it ""seems"" to hold everything, but not very secure, and very bulky."
5,Best Back Ever,This bag holds all the item securely. Every Item has it's place.Great backpack a most have.
5,Best Cat Toy Ever - Your Cats will FLIP!,"My young cat turns her nose up to most store-bought toys - she prefers batting around a piece of paper or crawling in bags or boxes. But when I got this toy, she absolutely went NUTS! I agree with other reviewers that the wall mount is useless. I didn't use the wall mount because I didn't want glue on my wall. The toy works just as well if not better just holding the small end in your hand. My cat loves the interaction with me, and made multiple flips in the air the first time she played with it! The only thing that would make this toy better is something on the end to hold onto while the cat plays with the other end. My hand gets tired after a while, gripping that tiny single tube of cardboard. Even so, I highly recommend this cat toy and will buy the Original next time without the wall mount."
4,Great toy,"My cat loves this. I attached it to the wall, and he would just go at it. It took him a little while to get used to it, but with a little encouragement, it got to be one of his favorite toys. It's great amusement for him when I don't have the time to play with him myself.It stayed on the wall really well. I don't know how removing it would go."
3,Boo's Door Station,Item was broken had to glue it together> I was afraid to ship it back because it could damage the delicate article.
4,"Good lube, make sure you shake very well!","I like how clean this lube wears and well it works! Make sure you shake the bottle very, very well before using it each time, otherwise you'll end up with a lot of thick, waxy lube at the end of the bottle."
4,Almost every song written and recorded by the Beatles,"This book is very good stuff. There, you can find almost every song written and recorded by the beatles in full score. Unfortunately, some songs from the Anthology albums are missing (e.g. Free as a Bird)."
2,Written in small letters,"This book is quite comprehensive, and probably covers everything possible to write down in notes and tabs regarding the music of The Beatles. You can't play through an entire song while looking in this book. As all songs are written down with vocals, two different guitars, bass, drums etc in parallel, you have to scroll through several pages to get through the song. In order compress all this information into as few pages as possible the author have used very small types. So you need to keep your head close to the book while playing if you want to get the information. This makes me think this book is written for ""conductors"" and teachers who want to get the whole picture in order to instruct groups and ensembles, and not for the individual musicians. Probably this book would work out well as bedside lecture for the theoretically minded musicians. The more practical oriented would probably find better sources elsewhere."
2,print way too small,"This book is great for collectors, but not appropriate for playing or singing due to the very small print."
4,Great for a fan but...,"This is great for a musician to use as a reference to the music of the Beatles and to figure out each song that they had recorded, however, there are some problems. I haven't looked through the entire book but there are some chords like F sharp being labelled F major. And incorrect lyrics for some songs like ""A Hard Day's Night"" Though, it comes very convienient to those that know the songs heart and soul and can pick out every riff and chord without the need of a book but would rather have a book to use to see if he is correct. Personally, I would advise a bit caution to those that don't have a great grasp of musical theory and just want to buy this book because of the Beatles but if you know a thing or to about music, don't mind the occasional typographical error and most importantly, are a tremendous fan of the boys from Liverpool, Merseyside then sure go for it..."
4,Beatles Score,The best Beatle music book yet. Extremely accurate. Captures the harmonic texture that was is unique to their music. My only beef is that the scores are difficult to read because the print is so small. If the publisher was wise they would print an edition about twice as large. I would be willing to pay for a larger edition.
5,"Excellent Transcriptions, But Small Print","If you want accurate transcriptions of every Beatles song, and you want every instrument including orchestration, then this is the only Beatles music book for you. But be warned, the print is microscopic. I have good eye sight so it's not a problem. But if you are the least bit challanged by small print, you'll be making a lot of blown-up copies."
3,"It's not you, it's me...","The book is way over my head. I sent it back. It's very thorough, but I can't judge whether it's accurate or not, but I suppose it is. Only one comment I would feel competent to make...the type is a bit light in contrast to the paper, making it hard to read."
2,"Cancer didn't kill George Harrison, this book did.","You pick it up and think, wow!, this is great. Then you read a couple of pages and realize you can get better stuff for free off the internet. Here is what you can expect:1. Pages are way too small. You'll be flipping endlessly just doing one song.2. Font is way too small. Invest in a high-powered magnifying glass if you plan on reading it. Don't even think about reading it in dim light.3. Font is some goofy script and often illegible. Couldn't they just use arial?4. Mistakes abound.About the only good thing I can say is that they usually get you close enough that you can figure it out. But at this price, it should be accurate.Hal Leonard, shame on you."
1,Is the Hubble Telescope Included?,"An unrivaled work, despite slight errors throughout. HOWEVER, it is unusable for playing (are you listening, publisher Hal Leonard?). I had the humiliating experience of being asked to leave a major photocopying chain for making enlarged copies - copyright infringement. Musicians, buy the book only if you want expensive filler for your bookshelf."
2,Wasted job,"The book is good, but should be in 2 volumes and larger, as the scores are tiny and you can hardly identify the notes."
4,The Beatles - complete scores review,Like the completeness of the set on The Beatles scores. The font of the tab definitely needs to be changed - bad choice really. The transcription part gets 8 1/2 out of 10
4,Where's DA cream fillin'??,This book is seriously da bomb!! But it loses 1 star for not having the keyboard part for Dig A Pony. Come on now...it's supposed to be COMPLETE!!
2,English???,"The grammar was very poor. The author used the wrong name for the character. It was bad enough to be distracting. The author also knows nothing about guns, 38 s don't have safeties."
2,short life,"Mine lasted about a year or so. Five year warranty - just send in the UPC code & orginal receipt along with the bulb. Yeah, right. So how do we cost-effectively dispose of these mercury-laden bulbs that last about a year? Kermit was right - it ain't easy being green."
4,As Expected,"The goggles are well made and designed. They are antifog, but don't keep out the water, but that was to be expected. I would purchase these again."
2,"Nice look, but foggy after 3 months","I loved the look and it was perfect for swimming laps for about 3 months. Then it started foggy all the time. I used the speedo anti-fog spray, but it only works for a few laps. I wish someone mentioned this in the review so I wouldn't have bought two... I wouldn't recommend this unless you replace your goggle every 3 months."
2,I Really Wanted to Like These Goggles-Blue Vanquisher,"I am a beginner swimmer and really wanted to like these goggles, which I've owned for a week and used four times. I'd heard and read so many wonderful things about the Vanquisher that I didn't feel like I needed to spend much time deciding on which goggles to buy. I was wrong.Pros: the straps are easy to adjust but not so easy that they'll un-adjust themselves; it's comfortable to wear (getting them on is a little challenging for me); it comes with three nose pieces for a customized fit.Cons: it leaks just a tiny bit. Maybe I am not using the right nose piece; it also fogs. This is a major problem for me because I cannot wear contact lenses, so I'm already swimming a little blind. Top it off with foggy tinted lenses and I'm lucky I don't smash into the wall."
4,"Great fit, but foggy","I swim anywhere from 1-2 miles at least three times/week and am really more concerned with comfort than speed. These are great for that. Other goggles I've owned feel like they're either boring into my face or attempting to suck my eyes out of my skull. As a related plus, I've noticed much lighter ""raccoon eyes"" after getting out of the pool. The only complaints I have are that there is not much allowance for peripheral vision, and these goggles do tend to fog over pretty quickly."
3,Good pair of goggle - some fogging issues.,"Overall a good pair of goggles. I have had some visibility issues, but that's still much better than not having goggles!Pros:No leakage - It definately keeps the water out.Fit - I switched out the nose piece for one of the smaller ones included and it fits perfectly.Comfort - The silicone cushioning is comfortable on my face. The straps also do not snag my hair.Cons:Visibility - The biggest problem with this is that the fog seems to crystallize some substance (maybe antifog film? maybe the chlorine and whatever else)on the inside surface of the lenses which reduces visability."
3,They are okay for outside,"I bought the green goggles and they are too dark, so I will have to buy a different pair for my indoor lap swimming. I used them outside at a friends pool and they worked great, they are just too dark for inside. They fit great, and I haven't had a problem with them fogging up."
1,Foggy Vanquishers!,"This is a review for the Speedo Women's Vanquisher. WHatever it is, DO NOT BUY IT. I received this in the mail after eagerly waiting for it. Purchased based on all the good reviews out there. I have just used it for a week. It worked well the first time and I really enjoyed doing laps. Managed to do more than 10 laps fog free on that day I got them. The next time I tried they fogged up midway doing the first lap. Rendered them quite useless and wasted time going to the pool.Pros: They wear comfortably, I had no goggle marks on my face and it immediately sticks to your eye sockets nicely when you put them on because of the suction.Cons: Foggy. Probably after 2nd or 3rd usage. Save the money or buy a different pair. My previous Speedo's were fog free but water leaked in -Speedo Flite"
5,Swim Goggle,This product was received in a very timely manner and was as advertised. Would buy from this business again.
3,Tint too strong,"Usually I love Vanquishers - I've been swimming for years at least 3-4 times a week, and they are my go-to goggle. I bought the 'clear' type and was surprised to find the tint on the eyepiece so strong, it's like swimming in murky water. I have bought the same ones (so I thought) in the past and never had this strong of a tint. They would be great for ocean/lake swimming in bright sunlight, but for an indoor pool, they are too dark."
1,I threw it in the garbage after one hour of trying it out,"The only way I could tell that this flashlight was actually working was to look directly at the bulbs (not normally recommended for LEDs'). But in the case of this unit, I could barely see any light output. I tried cranking it 3 time with no improvement. Since the price I paid was not worth the cost to ship it back for a refund, I just threw it in the garbage. Save yourself some money, and get the Garrity Power lite (which I DO have), or the Dynamo Illuminator (which got decent reviews also), that at least give you your money's worth...both sold by Amazon."
4,1000 Hurts sure to please,"This is a great album. Not as good as At Action Park but still really good. Don't buy the CD, though. A true Shellac fan should have a record player. CDs are the rich man's 8-track. ..."
2,yawn,"steve albini sounds tired. every other review seems to tote ""prayer to god"" like its some major breakthrough. i think he's just screwing around on that one actually. matter o' fact, it sounds like he's pretty much screwing around on the whole record. everything that WAS inventive about shellac is now not. for someone who prided themselves on breaking up his bands just after they hit their peak, albini sure missed the mark w/ shellac.. they try to break new ground with songs like new number order and song against itself, and it's quite sad.. mamma gina and QRJ are just mastabatorial nonsense. oooo is that a drum roll? wow! ok, ok, squirrel song kicks a little ass, but that's IT.to use a tired metaphor: watching the career of shellac is like watching a pretty girl go fat. if you really try, you can see the hot skinny chick she once was, but it's getting harder and harder to.. anyway, it's just a damned shame she got all fat."
4,"Solid box, but one little problem","This is a well-built, lightweight plastic box. The handle is large and comfy, and there is plenty of room to put in hammers, large wrenches, and other larger hand tools. The only problem is that the lid doesn't perfectly align with the box so I sometimes have to adjust the lid to close over the box."
2,cute but flimsy base,"while the heart-shaped tube is awfully cute, the plastic base that it sits upon is really flimsy and cheaply made. the bottom (underneath) is made of basically cardboard, and it was already somewhat buckled when i took it out of the package--it doesn't even sit flat on a shelf. also, the piece of ""metal"" included that you can have monogrammed is not impressive, either. sorry to be negative, but i'm just being honest!"
3,Eh...,"This book was somewhat anticlimactic for me after reading all the wonderful reviews, and especially after having read all the Anchee Min novels. I was so excited about reading a book created around the 1989 protests and the specific character, but it just didn't seem to have the beautiful descriptions that other Chinese based novels I have read before have. It was a very good book, but just not all that everyone said it was. I would recommend reading Red Azalea after you read this, or Becoming Madame Mao."
2,2 Stars for being made of actual metal!,"I was expecting a more stable fit and better build quality. Also didn't expect the product to be dropped from the sky by UPS either, well that is how it looked like the package was delivered. The box it came in was destroyed, if they didn't just leave it without ringing the bell, I would have refused it. Shockingly all the parts it appears were there, just covered in rust dust. Every single piece was covered in this dust, even the inside of the product. The product is made of square steel tubing, even where it fits into the receiver. The fit in the receiver is not acceptable. I have a BACKRACK on my pickup and was going to use this product with it to carry a 40' ladder. If you are simply using it to ""EXTEND"" your bed to carry a canoe or kayak it will be fine. To use in a vertical manner as they show, would be silly with the amount of movement that occurs at the top. For the price I was expecting much better quality, I should have known better for the price."
2,"OK, but quality questionable","I just received the Darby Extend a Truck. Package appeared to have been opened before and taped shut again. Mounted it on my truck and the T-bar appeared crooked. Got out the old square and found the T-section was out of square by about 1/2 inch over a 2 foot section, making one side appear 1 inch lower than the other side. Plan to call the company and see if they'll send me a new T-Section. Otherwise I'll take it to a welder and have him square it up. I'm sure it will work OK for carrying kayaks, but they ought to check to make sure the T-section is square. Not even close."
2,Big Mouth & Ugly Girl,"Big Mouth & Ugly Girl was about a boy, Matt who likes to write. One day he submitted one of his papers to the school newspaper, and it was rejected. One of his friends asked him what he was going to do he said ""What can I do blow up the school and massacre all the students?"" Some one heard and told on him. Later that day, two detectives took him away. A few people heard what he said but didn't have the courage to tell anyone. Everyone that is but, Ursula. Ursula has always been known as an Ugly Girl because she is bigger and meaner than all the other girls, and most of the boys. She tells the principle what Matt says and gets him out of trouble, at school. The accusation made Matt's parents really mad, and screwed up most of their life, so they want to sue the school. Because of this problems come along with it. The media never leaves Matt and Ursula alone and some one is trying to get Matt's life really messed up."
3,BM&UG,"Big Mouth and Ugly girl is about a Girl Named Ursula Riggs. She meets a guy named Matt Donaghy under a unique circumstance. Matt gets 'ratted out' by two girls for threatening to blow up the school and massacre students. Ursula is the only one to stick up for him, because his friends abandoned him when they needed him most. The book was somewhat intriguing and a good book if you just want something fun. It ends happily with Matt and Ursula becoming a couple has a 'happily ever after' feel."
3,Big Mouth & Ugly Girl,"Unexpectedly on a normal school day, the police pull Matt (Big Mouth) Donaghy out of his study hall class. Matt learns later that he was overheard wrong during lunch, and is suspected of making bomb threats to the school. While Matt is in custody, what Matt thought were his friends stop talking to Matt. Suddenly, Ursula (Ugly Girl) comes to Matt's rescue. Ursula bravely does what she thinks is right, and testifies for Matt. The rest of Carol Oates's fiction novel Big Mouth and Ugly Girl contains Matt and Ursula growing into their new friendship. Though the book is a bit rough to get into at first, it begins to get more interesting with the second part of the book. The reader begins to look inside each of the main characters, and learn that their outside images aren't always the same as their insides. Overall, readers learn how a great, unexpected friendship can be more meaningful than the world in a teenager's life."
3,Some issues,"This was purchased as a text book for a child development course. Copy #1 arrived, was poorly packed and had been damaged in transit. We returned it, and Amazon shipped copy number 2. Copy #2 wasn't new - it had highlighter markings in some chapters and sticky notes. Back it went to Amazon. Copy #3 arrived, new and properly packed.There was a further hiccup with the returns. Amazon warned that we hadn't returned copy #1, after I'd had an email confirming receipt. I called the secret support line and they sorted it out!Overall, Good service.The book? Some chapters refer to the CD (comes with book), and the CD has no content to support the references. The book's required reading, and is a pretty good text book."
3,More of a comment than a review:,"I haven't read the book, and the table of contents look very interesting, but the date in common era for a book about Christianity bothers me. Why would the publisher or author use an innovative secular dating system for a book on Christian antiquity? It seems like a contradiction, and it is sure to repel Christians, the main gruop of people who will read this book."
2,Oops! I did it again...,"Oops! I bought another CD based on reviews and impressions and it just doesn't hold up.I love Bleach! I love the music, so I thought that this CD would really make me happy. I doesn't. First- sometimes music is best when matched with imagery like the opening tracks for Bleach. To just listen is not quite as good. It sets you up for expectation of more, and doesn't deliver. Also to spend nearly $20 for less than 15 minutes of music is ridiculous. Yeah, I know it's an import and all but I still felt cheated. It's like kinda cool, but not great and then it's over before you even get a chance to get into it. Lame. If you have tons of cash and don't care- go for it, otherwise pass on this one and save for something really great, or buy Bleach anime and get it all."
5,One of the best episodes,"This is one of the most interesting episodes in this unique series of 17 shows. It has fewer confusing and complicated plot twists of some of the other episodes and is therefore interesting to both ""addicts"" of the show who hang on every word (and often overinterpret things) and to ""non-addicts"" who enjoy the show for its pure entertainment value. If it becomes available again, this is one of the first episodes I will upgrade to DVD."
5,Awesome!!,This is my favorite cd for myself and to give as a gift. Each song is so meaningful to me as I have served in the military for over 10 years. I have been to Iraq and actually got to meet Keni Thomas while I was in Kuwait. He's a super nice guy with a devotion to the troops unlike any other. I would recommend this album to anyone!
5,Great CD for Veterans,As a Veteran this is one of the best CD's I've ever bought. I think every Veteran should own this CD. Keni Thomas is an outstanding singer!
1,Lame,Are you serious... anyone who buys this has to be the laziest person on Earth. Oh no how did we survive without this invention lol! Give me a break. I saw this product and die laughing my ass off!
2,cute but not worth the money,"I bought these for my newborn. He moves around too much and they fall off. One time, the urine stream made it fall off. They are cute and a great idea, but just not worth the money. They just don't stay on."
5,waterfalls,"i have just purchased ""beautiful waterfalls""and found it to be ""beautiful""indeed the music was very soothingthis is one of many documentary i have purchased latelyit's nice to relax once and a whilethe cuz"
1,Cure for insomnia,"Being from Norway, I thought it was strange that there was a Norwegian band recommended to me on the basis of my prog rock purchases that I hadn't ever heard of. Now that I have ""Sacrament"", I understand why: they're really, really boring. No one told me about them before because they're not worth mentioning.The songs are dull, the playing pedestrian, the singing wan, and the sound of the album so subdued it fades into the slightest background noise. There's no substance, no character, no assertiveness, subtlety, quirk, theme or innovation to grab on to.There's nothing progressive going on here. However, the album does have its uses - I'm confident it will put even the most frantic and desperate insomniac to sleep.Insipid, [bad] and completely lacking in direction: Easily the worst of the last 200 albums I've bought."
3,JUST OK I GUESS,"Hey the band is great but a 15'Ep with 4 songs one of which is the same as on the Losing Control cd, the other an awful live version of another song from another record and the other 2 so-so new tracks, add to that it's an obscenely overpriced import and what you got ? Dissapointment !"
1,"It sucks, would never buy another",We have been getting Country Family Reunion by Larry Black. They are are great. This Country Legends Don't stand a chance.You wanted my opinion. Now you have it.Have a great day.Ken
1,Better start looking for a new knife,"As soon as I used it scratches started to appear on the blade then the edge was dulled in less than a few mins. It comes with no instructions, nothing just the product and an empty box. It looked easy enought but in the end was just a wast of money."
4,last stand from a great band,"Great scruffy, indie guitar-pop with righteously pealing two-part female harmony and songs that swell with bursts of anthemic melody, sometimes somber, sometimes frisky. Avoid all subsequent releases as they are knotty, overly clever, didactic and lacking in the charm of this record. It's a shame they would turn their back on this sound, as they admittedly did, because the direct melodicism here made for a more affecting record than their later art-brat phase. lead singer chic's got an attitude too"
1,Don't waste your Money,"I really don't understand this DVD. The woman photographer is shooting Nudes and does not really explain anything, you don't really see any setups and she doesn't really explain the nature of her lighting.Then she shoot her nude model while in the nude herself!!! How professional is that?No value what so ever."
1,Complete waste of time and money,"This is the worst photography (or any other subject matter) DVD I have had the misfortune of paying for. It is contains pathetic, amateurish 'lighting' experiments. The tawrdry model is full of body piercings and tattoos. The photographer parades around in a black, see-through stocking outfit in one shooting sequence, and then treats us to a view of her shrunken breasts when she photographs herself in blue light. I think the real purpose of the DVD was to give the photographer a means to exhibit herself when no one would hire her as a model."
1,A disappointing novel with TV-movie plot,"This novel was a major disappointment, especially after reading a positive review of the book. The point of view alternates among several individuals involved with the small boy, including that of the boy itself--if you like reams and reams of baby-talk, then this book is for you. Grown-ups would have preferred that the author had fashioned a less predictable plot (conflict over custody between black and white grandparents) that seems calculated for a movie or TV sale. Skip the book and wait for the film."
4,Be sure to note this is round and not square set,"This set is very nice, and bold in display, as mentioned. Santa's fur trim is 'raised-rough' texure on the dishes. They are folk-art type Santa on a black background with dark red-check rims. Tiny stars, and ""Joy"", ""St Nick"", Noel, ""Ho Ho Ho"" are respectively lightly sketched on each plate with four different Santa 'portraits'. I haven't used the set, as bought on sale after Xmas. Details portion mentions set having square dishes and bowls, and further on states round, but that ""Sakura sells square set"". This IS the ROUND set. I have the square set, and wanted to add settings, so was disappointed, but I'm keeping the set for additional place settings, until I can find more of the square. This set is on the heavy side, but not as heavy or large as the square set, should you ever find it."
4,More Good Music,"This is another excellent release fromJack Logan. Nothing groundbreaking, just good quality Jack Logan material.Working with Bob Kimbell seems to bring out his best."
3,Nice bulb w/some flaws,"We have used the EFG25E50 bulbs for years. The optional reflectors make a huge difference in the lighting effect. However, these bulbs could have been engineered better: they take several seconds to reach maximum brightness, the brightness deteriorates dramatically when the bulb is about to fail, and the 10,000 hours rated life is way off. Our longest lasting bulb was about 6,388 hours (7 hrs/day x 365 days x 2.5 yrs), and that's a generous estimate. Panasonic never responded to our inquiry. We still use them because they are nice and have come down in price."
3,light capsule,"I am pleased with the bulb, but I would like to order more than one at a time but that doesn't seem to be possible. Does that mean that I bought the last one made? I know that Panasonic is no longer making them."
4,Great Light but...,"The light from the bulb is excellent, the warm light feels like day light, while the Verilux daylight really feels too strong on the blue spectrum to me, at least I don't feel seeing the same color under the sun light with VeriluxThe Panasonic bulb is great except it takes a while to reach full brightness(like 20 sec. or so). and it starts very dim. The 15w looks like a 20w. incandlescent for the first 5 sec. if you have not turned on the light for a while(10 minutes). which might annoy some people. Yet I don't have problem with other bulb flourscent light with such a long delay such as Verilux."
4,Good Variety,"One of the reasons that I bought this book was because of a review saying that in CH.5 the how to draw topics of cat ears,wings,fairy,tails ETC. Bu the book only has 4 Chapters in which they skip of the ""CH.5"" and goes into ""learn from the pros"". Also the photo of the cover that Amazon shows has a DIFFERENT TITLE than the book I got. The title that starts with ""techiques for drawing..."" is in the inside cover.this book talks about all the body parts. In the 1st pages it gives step by step on drawing a female body, but then for the rest of the book it's only once and a while there's a mini step by step off to the corner."
2,"Good reference material, but it doesn't teach you how to draw anything!","I was very dissapointed with this book. I bought this in hopes of learning how to draw manga girls better, but this book is filled with nothing but the female anatomy and random girls posing half-naked.Over half of the book tutors you on the breasts, buttox, bras, etc.There isn't a single page that actually teaches you step-by-step how to properly DRAW something!!The title of this book is sorely misleading; this book doesn't teach you how to draw anything. Its just a big book explaining the female human anatomy, and nothing else."
1,what in the...?,"this book is full of kiddy porn, for some dirty old men, but other then that I didn't learn any thing, save your$."
2,Not OEM quality,"Either Lenovo has changed the spec, or these are cheap imitations. While identical physically (so they fit the laptop), they are made of a material that is not as tacky to the touch so fingers slip off easily."
5,Building a studio? Get this book before you start.,I have just about all the other books out there on DIY studio construction. This is really the only one I use. The information is solid and the construction techniques are well laid out and easy to follow. It has saved my butt time and time again. Good work Rod!
5,Not what you think,"This is an excellent economic study of how financial aid affects the decisions of undergraduates to attend institutions, including whether to attend or not. The Student Aid Game should be read by anyone interested in making college more accessable to those who are qualified to attend but can not afford it. Schapiro and McPherson demonstrate that increasing Federal Financial Aid greatly increases the participation of minorities and the poor. It is not, however, a book designed to help parents manuever through the paper jungle of financial aid offers and dealing with financial aid offices. Their goal is far more grand, pushing for policy changes that will increase the opportunities minorities and poor americans have to attend institutions of higher learning"
4,REGION 2 DVD IS WIDESCREEN,I know Disney is hopeless in these things but R2 is widescreen. So get your copy from amazon.co.uk if you want the widescreen version!
3,It's Different,"Most of the tracks are pretty good. Mina Loy, A100 and DIA caught my attention, but, overall, the album disappointed a little. It doesn't sound anything like Billy's previous music. Sure, it's different. I get that. But I would've enjoyed it a Hell of a lot more if it rocked like The Pumpkins. I guess I'd compare it to a slower, less cryptic version of Adore, And, overall, it's still a good buy. Originally, iTunes released the album digitally with a 13th bonus track entitled Tilt. The song's not available anymore, but, as a side note, it's worth checking out if you can find it."
3,I'm Brasilian,"The Future Embrace. Aos brasileiros ou portugueses ou ainda aqueles que entendem portugus, segue meu recado:Conheo Billy corgan e os Smashing Pumpkins desde 1993 e seus sonhos siameses.Sou f de carteirinha desse ícone da minha gerao como compositor e músico da década de 90.Mas em resumo The Future Embrace, poderia ser melhor.Exagera em programao de bateria, perdendo a principal caracteristica solo do Billy que é o piano, violo e suas perfeitas composies que do destacaque a sua voz.Um som mecanizado e sem a cara do Billy.Se o disco tivesse sido acústico, seria melhor.As músicas so boas, lembra muito o album ADORE de 1998 dos Smashinbg Pumpkins, quando Jimmy no estava na banda.O maior defeito do disco é a participao de Mr. Smith e um cover sem sal do Bee Gees.Billy...segue o insignificante recado de um grande f e admirador de sua obra....""No se reinvente, nem tenha medo do passado...sua obra já é bela por si só"""
3,HAHAHA!,"Someone a few lines down thinks billy corgan's a woman!!!!! i dont know if they were serious or not but i f***ing laughed my arse off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! As for the album, its pretty cool - ALOT and i mean ALOT better than zwan - zwan was awful. Also, there's another reviewer below who says the pumpkins are getting back together??!! that would be cool. I really dont mind this album though - it is very adore-esque and simple. But still has quite a few corgan/flood/moulder sounds that i really appreciate! Peace."
5,Good music.,Flash back from my childhood! Party Tyme is always a great purchase. I own 1- 17 and love all of them. Love this music!!
5,Petrushka,"Petrushka is arguably the best ballet Stravinsky ever wrote. If you liked The Rite of Spring or The Firebird, then you will love this score. Stravinsky was a brilliant composer and Petrushka is an example of one of his finest works. The story is about a Russian puppet show, but the music can be interpreted in so many ways, there really is no way to review the ballet based on what one person thinks it should have been. Therefore, I will tell you just that the music is wonderful even if you would have interpreted the ballet itself otherwise."
1,"colorful, but fairly useless","The content of this book is not up to the quality of paper it is printed on or to the number of colorful pictures. The book is essentially a collection of advertisement of vendors offering photoshop-compatible plugins, which sponsored this book. The author neither attempts to compare the third-party plug-ins with those included into the Photoshop package, nor discusses the advantages and limitations of each plug-in. The enclosed CD containes primarily demo (limited functionality) versions of some plug-ins and programs, but no practical lessons, as most books with CD-ROMs do. If you are looking for an unusual effect which cannot be achieved by using the standard Photoshop filters, this book may help you to find a place where to buy what you need. Generally, you get much less than you would expect to get for this money."
2,limited use; limited scope; outdated,"This book helped me to understand the general concept of plug-ins, but that's about all. I found it at half price, but it was hardly worth that to me. The CD is mostly a lot of save-disabled demos and trials for commercial plug-ins. It was written when Photoshop was in version 4.0, so even when it discusses plug-ins that come with Photoshop, it is too outdated. Plug-ins are not discussed in detail - only one (set of) setting(s) per plug-in is covered. I'd like to see a new book on this topic that also covers the multitude of free plug-ins now available. This book doesn't."
4,Funny in a weird kind of way,ok - you have to be in the mood for this type video. its like Southpark in the early years. Makes me wonder if this had been real live actors if they could have gotten away with as much dialogue as they do in this. If they ever make a season 3 I'd most likely get it!Vendor sent it way ahead of estimated delivery date and I received it in exactly as described! Great transaction!
3,This is where they started to fall off bigtime!,"As far as i see it, there best work was ""All we got is us"". After that, they started sliding down ever since and it started with this album. While Shut'em down Remix, The Worst, and Raze it up were the best songs on the CD, while the others either sounded like they was trying too hard to bring back the style they showed on the second album or they came off soft on other songs that had singing in them and that's not them. To me, this was the beginning of the end for them as far as them being a force on the hip hop scene."
4,"The Best ""fetch"" Toy!","This ball is wonderful when you get your technique down. A definite arm saver and it goes extremely far! Downside, dogs can chew through it in a heartbeat."
5,Prl Ball Go-frrr sling shot ball,"This is the only ball my 5 year old Rottie will actually play with. The sound of the rubber sling going through the air gets her so excited. I have tried many other balls when the last of these balls were finally gone (they are not sold anywhere in stores that I could find and she just looks at them and says "" are you kidding"" It's pretty interesting how much she loves this ball."
5,Prophetic,Edward Said was a brilliant scholar. He predicted in 1993 that Oslo will lead nowhere. He was attacked from all sides as a kill joy. But it's now almost 20 years later and there's still no peace. Anyone who heard Netanyahu's speech in Congress and his scolding of Obama should come to the conclusion that Israel does not want peace with the Palestinians. So read this book and see for yourself why Said never believed in the peace process.
5,Squeeze soars to the height's,"Squeeze and Messrs. Difford and Tilbrook soar to the heights on this release. A height that has only been reached here and there since the Beatles in the 1960's. When ""Play"" was released unlike some other current artists, the first listening was a nuclear blast. From the perfect melodic interplay of ""House of Love"" and ""Satisfied"" to the deep lyrical starkness of the pop-country tinged ""The Truth"" and the McCartney-like ""Gone to the Dog's"" this CD is a throwback to the day's when Beatles fans waited with intense longing for the next masterpiece from merrie old England. A decade and a half later, like a fine wine it has only increased its beauty and effervescence."
5,great!!,"My son loved this truck. It looks very real. It seems durable, 2 months after Christmas and still looks like new. Great gift for someone who loves trucks."
5,Lovely Garbage truck,"This is our 5th Bruder toys in the house. We already have 1 green garbage truck, fire engine, cement mixer and couple construction vehicles set. My 4-year old loves this toy since this is big and yet not too big that he can move this around the house. This is very well made and his play date once sat on it and it is still in good shape. This is good money spent on something that would last for a long time."
3,"a very high quality, comfortable, ugly sneaker","The last pair of steve maddens I had lasted for years, and I'm sure this pair will too. They are very comfortable, and very high quality. But I think the design, especially on the top is kind of ugly, and had I seen them in the store I wouldn't have bought them. Stylistically, there is just too much going on...and in real life the shoe just looks like a messy design trying to pass itself off as stylish"
3,Good Enough To Get Around,"As phrasebooks go, this one is very good. It'll get you around easy enough without making a total fool of yourself. Well worth the money."
3,"Good content, but print too small","I would have preferred half the content in a larger font. It is good however, for those with young eyes."
1,One Very Trite Book.,"Famous American ""star"" journalists are well known for their bland, conformist mindsets, and their bad writing. This book is just another badly written and incredibly trite ""travel diary"". Much of the book has Salisbury anachronistically hyping his own career, but even the accounts of 1989 fail as a human interest story. As history or journalism, the book is useless, as it gives no background or context, and darn little content."
4,Not Bad!,"The reviews for this book seem to be either really good or really bad.I found the book to be an enjoyable read. Yes, it defiantely is ""light"", and of course its not intended to be a comprehensive documentary. If one reads this book for what it is, the journal of a media individual on a very upheaved time in Chiense history, they will certainly not be disappointed.Harrison writes briefly, with just the right amount of detail. After reading this, you will not know everything about the happenings in Tiananmen, but you will get a good partial view of it. And, yes, the author's writing style is not amazing, but it really is good enough for this sort of a book and it is very functional."
2,Kinda' Okay,"They are definitely sexy looking, but I'm a size 6/7, and they are very big. They almost slip right off ... Not at the right time, either. If I were bigger than a 7 I'd have been happier with them.On the upside, The tag on them are safety pinned on ... saved me the trouble of having to find one to cinch them with."
2,Where's the Beef?,I read this book and the author is very vague about how you can go about doing some of the things he brings up in the book.At least he could have suggested some lawyers that are versed onhow to proceed with some of this debt elimination tactics that he describes. After reading the book one is left to fend for oneself without much in the way of help or useful information just vague ideas.
4,Definitely Relaxing,"For me, the Alluna tabs pretty much worked as intended. They don't necessarily make you sleepy but instead, they relax you so you can more easily fall asleep. I would take Alluna about 30 minutes before sleep and sure enough--my nightly work-related anxieties would greatly diminish, allowing me to more readily fall asleep. I'm still trying other natural sleep aids, but Alluna is definitely in the top group."
3,"Very nice, but more of a textbook.","This book has some lovely interiors and color combination ideas, but it's more of a textbook and has many pages devoted to color spectrum charts and the science of color. I read about it in a well-known home decorating magazine which described it as one of the best books for decorating with color, but I really found it a little too technical. If you are a design student, it would probably be more appropriate."
3,Legend's Of Soul...,Album has a nice vibe to it... Nothing much to say jus got it for collection sakes...Mokgabudi
5,Revival In Belfast II,"How can a worshipping heart not love Robin Mark's music? This is quite good and lyrically lovely. However, if you are expecting something like the original Revival In Belfast, put those thoughts aside. I think that was an unusual move of the Spirit, that cannot be duplicated. Still, I reccomend this CD with no apologies. Open your heart and enjoy! The shipping and communication were without problem. I reccomend the vendor without hesitation."
3,I really love this album,"I had to revise my comments after listening to this CD more. I heard the song Killovil an Irish instrumental. I thought the CD was going to have Irish type music or Irish/Worship music. This was the only Irish instrumental on the CD. After playing the album a few times there are worship songs with the whistle and Irish flavor. I have come to love this CD. There are many good songs on it. My favorite worship song is ""Some Kind of Love"" and ""Miracle in My Heart"". Miracle in My Heart has the Irish whistle in. The CD music and songs are uplifting. I tried to change the rating from 3 to 5. I now want to rate this CD a 5"
2,My least favorite Robin Mark CD,"I really like all of Robin Mark's CDs, except for this one. I think that on all his other CDs you hear a musician who puts his whole heart into his music. This CD is still good and I myself could not sing nearly as well, but Revival in Belfast II somehow seems to be ""a little more flat"" and ""just another Christian CD"" whereas the others were more special."
2,Pillows with a Punch,"I love everything Betzina. Her books and DVDs are excellent, and as an avid sewer for decades, I still learn new skills and get great ideas from her. However, this video is not up to the same quality as her other ones. Her others are packed with so many tips, hints, ideas - this one lacked the punch the others have. It seems it should either have more information in it, or be priced less."
4,One of the best albums this year,"I think, that this is one of the best hiphop albums this year. Curse (a german rapper) improved his skills with this album. ""Von innen nach außen"" contained of brilliant lycris and wonderful musical arrangements. Basically it is a real hiphop album, but lyrics are very personal. this is not typical in the German hiphop scene, but it makes the album very special. I am very interested in the further projects from this artist."
4,A Bounce-Back Performance,I enjoyed this latest project from EB. It reminds us of how good he was Before the Halle dilemna. It shows us that smoothness and mellowness that caused Halle to be attracted to him in the first place. He's back to charming us with his melodies and sultriness. A very nice comeback.
2,Where Did the Soul Go?,"First let me start by saying I am a big Eric Benet fan and have been salivating for this album. It was a big letdown. While all in all, and individually, the songs are good---they are just not Eric Benet's style. Way too adult contemporary, pop. The man has a voice like butter and his roots are in soul. And while he has a wonderful tone, he does not have the vocal RANGE to pull off some of these big ballads on this album.I am sure this album was a very cathartic and renewing experience for him, as an individual, but it does nothing for him as an artist. There is not one cut on here for the radio, except ""Where Does the Love Go"". I applaud his honesty on this album, but i hope he gets back to his roots before it's too late."
4,Uplifting!,"This book deals with common issues faced by many women that I know personally. In a time when ""showing out"" is a normal everyday act, it was refreshing to read a book that deals with issues that ""make you wanna scream"" but instead of screaming and pulling hair, faith and patience are put into motion and love perserveres. Great book club read."
1,Not as great as it looks,"I was a little disappointed by this item - there are many stickers, but they are not easily re-usable (at least not for my 2.5 yr old) and there are not really that many options for creating different pictures if you want the machines to be in places where they make sense. My son, who is a construction site fan, lost interest after first use."
3,Why are there 2 second gaps in an unedited recording?,"For that reason alone this gets 3 stars.Between each track there is a 2 second gap.Or is mine the only one?On the front it says unedited.I am confused.Other than that I would say the sound is great, the show is great and it is nice to see another icon putting out live recordings.Just what the fans have been wanting for a long time."
4,Just Another Great McCammon Book,"Don't let the 600 pages intimidate you. This book will keep you turning the pages until the end, at which point you may be asking yourself why a sequel has not been written. McCammon is just a great writer. He has written some of the best books I have ever read. This is not his best, but even his lesser novels are great. His ability to write different types of books is astounding. To go from this, to Swan Song, to Boy's Life..Let's just say that anything from McCammon is very satisfying, and when he's great, he's breathtaking. Although this book does not quite reach that level, it has periods when it does. To be truley honest, it is a 4 1/2 star-er."
2,Worse Than A Poor Man's Frank Zappa,"God help me for disparaging Frank Zappa by mentioning him in describing this incomprehensible CD. Zappa had chops, Zappa had humor, Mr. Bungle has neither, though it appears they were influenced by him. It's weird without a purpose, highly unlistenable, and only marginally creative. It doesn't stir passion in the listener the way great (and even good) music does and should. The singer sounds like Jello Biafra on a bad day and the lyrics belong in the Non Sequitur Hall of Fame.Highly unrecommended."
4,If you like this............,If you are considering buying this CD it is definatly cool. But.....if you want something like this with a bit of a harder edge Check out Flat Stick ...They are awesome!!!!!
5,It is all clear now.,"My understanding of the universe is complete now after listening to Mr. Bungle. XM, I love u! I am a fan of ""Weirdness Special X"" and it was one afternoon after listening to Mrs. Miller singing a Beatles song that all of the sudden the sky opened and Pink Cigarette from Mr. Bungle's California played. I was like, ""damn! This music is delightfully weird!""I immediately proceeded to my closest Virgin Megastore and I got the self titled Mr. Bungle's first CD. My reaction? It was like being strapped to a chair getting a haircut from a deformed and scary clown from hell whistling a scary melody and being terrified of what the hell bound clown can do to me with the scissors. Do you get the message? I could not move a single inch until the CD was over and when it finally was, I had to listen to it again.I bought Disco Volante and California as well. Buy them! They are well worth it!!!! Thank you, Mr. Bungle. I am a complete human being now."
3,...kind of amateur compared to other Bungle albums,"well it really deserves close to 5 stars, but I'm with the other guy who said this album pails in comparison with their other two, although they're all so different, you shouldn't even compare too much. A much more bizarre, more ""mature,"" DIVERSE and rewarding album is Disco Volante (jazzy,metal, techno and ""avant-garde as opposed to the more funky dare I say ska tendencies of this one) while ""California"" is Bungle's version of pop and still demented as hell. Still not much out there comes close to being as uniquely ""other"" than this album. Top 3 tracks Quote Unquote, My Ass is on fire, carousel. Next Three Squeeze Me Macaroni, Dead Goon and Girls of Porn. Only two tracks I don't care for as much anymore, egg and love is a fist. They should have put some of their older demos on this album I think, a few of them would have fit in really nicely."
5,Soul music,"I'm not a big fan of instrumental music, but after hearing this album I might just change my mind! Playing this music, looking into a starry sky and drift away, that's my recomendation."
3,name is dumb but its entertaining,its like the skyking series just fighting robots instead of monsters. red robot is more like what it should have been named since red baron was a german ace that was killed this name was dumb.not a full screen either.
5,"Spelt Berries, 1 lb.",Very satisfied with product. Shipping was fast. Product arrived sooner than expected. Will purchase from Barry's Farm again.
5,In-depth history of both man and machine,"Ed Youngblood, long-time director of the American Motorcyclist Association, has put to ink the life story of John Penton, one of America's premier off-road racers, and his quest to build the perfect off-road motorcycle. This biography traces the roots of the Penton clan from their modest, rural-Ohio farmstead, through personal triumph and tragedy, and explores the man behind the famed Penton motorcycles that were so victorious in the late 60's through the late 70's in America and overseas. Any vintage off-road afficionado will appreciate this behind-the-scenes look at the Penton racing dynasty. John Penton was a man driven to succeed, driven to reach for his dreams, driven to prove to the world that the impossible could be realized. The off-road motorcycling world today owes so much to this man of vision. Youngblood's biography shows us what this man is made of."
5,Excellent transfer of a Giallo classic,"Just finished watching this, truly amazed at how great it looks and sounds, kudos to Blue Underground for doing this film great justice.There are two versions of the film, a U.S. dubbed cut which is 90 mins, and the original Italian cut which is 93 and contains nice clear yellow subtitles.There's also an introduction by Eli Roth who claims it's one of the best Gialli, and an interview with the director which is 11 mins, some trailers, T.V. spots, all in Hi-Def, not a huge amount but enough (it's not exactly The Godfather!)If your thinking of upgrading your regular dvd to this blu ray version, I would recommend in doing so (that's only if you really like the film of course!)Picture: 4.5/5Sound: 4/5 (DTS HD Mono).VERY good release."
4,A Bit Long!,"It's a bit long. Perhaps a bit TOO long. 3 hours for the first disc alone. It may be more than the average fan needs or wants to know and as other fans have mentioned in their reviews Donovan does come off a bit in awe of himself at times.But it's very entertaining and I did learn a few things that I didnt know before. But like I said, THREE hours for a bio of Donovan? It did get tedious towards the end."
5,The Ultimate Donovan Movie,"This film has Donovan telling it all, from his early childhood, to his hit singles to traveling with the Beatles to India to reuniting with his muse Linda. It also shows the work Donovan did for film (Brother Sun Sister Moon, The Pied Piper and a Gap commercial with ""Mellow Yellow"") The bonus disc has several live performances (some which can be seen on the Kodak Theatre concert)and a peek inside Donovan's basement (going through his albums on vinyl) It isn't that bad, it covers much more than his somewhat abridged autobiographyThe Autobiography of Donovan: The Hurdy Gurdy ManForget those crappy reviews that say it's ""Donovan interviewing Donovan"", this was all done by the director who interviewed him over the past five years. It would be interesting to hear some more (about the cover versions of his songs maybe) but three hours is enough!"
1,Use Another Book,This book is not good at explaining linear algebra or differential equations. Gilbert Strang has a much better book and many math books that are specific to areas of applied math typically explain both concepts. Be prepared to use some reference books if your prof. requires this text.
1,possibly the worst math book ever,"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOKthis was the textbook for my first course in linear algebra and differential equations. i think there were about 350 students in the class and, i say about 90% students i talked to agreed: this book sucks. period. lack of solved problems. no practice questions. unhelpful.i don't mean soso-bad, i mean really really badyou can get much superior books for the this price"
5,Hard to praise this band enough...,"They come from a well established genre and yet transcend it, they have mass appeal and yet defy the mainstream, they are a bit chilled/nostalgic/cheeky/rocky and entirely brit pop and yet there is no one like them. This album gets in your head and stays there and in a beautiful kind of brainwash. A classic in the making."
2,did i miss something???,"i dunno, i bought this album on a whim and based my judgement on all of the raving reviews here. the album pretty much got 5 stars almost everywhere...so i bought it, liked it the first time i listened to it, and then every other time i put the cd on i got bored, and, well, frustrated. b/c some of the tracks are cool, but OVERALL THE ALBUM IS WEAK and doesn't stand out in any way. it's not bad background music and is rather catchy and poppy (but not at all trippy), but nothing i'd ever seriously listen to again."
3,Good but not phenomenal like other albums,"A very very solid album with some bad ass sounds on it. Problem is I got this after ""Who Can you trust"" and to me that is SUCH a definitive album. This is good but it just sounds like a more cleaned up and kind of watered down ""Who can you trust"".The more melodious and sweet songs are where this album shines though. ""The sea"", ""over and over"" being standouts.Alot more accesible than the first album, but just not the same feeling."
3,ok Cd,"I loved Parachute, so I bought this. It isn't quite as good as parachute in that it added more electric guitars and polished their sound a little more. I love the songs on this album and may be their best. Every single song on it is listenable and in my opinion there isn't a stand-out song, but rather all are good. A must have if you like Guster."
5,This CD is awesome!,guster is my favorite band and this CD definetly rules. although it is absolutely nothing compared to their concerts. They are incredible!
4,Nice flow,"This is a good DVD for practitioners who have an established practice, as it is not instructional.However, if you're looking for a fairly vigorous routine, which incorporates sun salutation variations, you can let go of your mind and drop into the experience of your body through the smooth, pleasant voice and guidance of Diane Finlayson."
1,deceiving,"To Whom that orders this lights, beware, because you will only get one single light, regardless what you see on the picture, one light no wires, no fuse no switch, nothing but one light, and do not waste your time contacting Amazon, because on their catalog specifies one light but on their website it does not, so if you want two of them be prepared to spend some bucks. $124.38 for two lights, $6.99 for wires, $10.99 for a relay, $3.99 for a fuse holder, $ 4.98 for a switch, for a grand total of $151.33."
2,could be cheaper,i got into a 4ft pool and the watch just went blank it says water resistant.i really liked it but i got dissapointed.
3,"This toy should be great, but isn't","Maybe whether or not a cat likes this toy is a matter of the cat's toy preference. This toy looks and feels like a great, quality product, but for some reason does not attract the cat's attention."
4,Good,It is so simple yet Oh So Fun for the kitties. This is one of the few interactive toys that all the cats enjoy playing with.
5,great cheap toy.,Used this to train my kitten to follow me on our walks on the property. Any time it looked like he was distracted and was wandering away I would wiggle this toy and he would be back on track. He now follows me faithfully on our walks and rarely needs this toy as a distraction. This toy was a valuable tool in training my kitten and he still loves to play with it when we sit on the deck.
3,There are more enticing dangle toys,"My kittens rate this an ""OK"".They'll give it their attention for a few minutes, but it doesn'tobsess them like the ""Cat Dancer"" and ""Da Bird"" ."
2,cat isn't too interested.,I bought this toy based on the reviews but my kitten doesn't seem to excited to play with it. she prefers bottle caps and things that make noise. that would be an improvement.
2,"Cat ate it. So much for ""indestructible.""","Admittedly we do have a strange Manx cat who thinks he's a dog and eats paper and books and also grooms our dog, but he was not too interested in this toy as a toy. Rather, he ate most of the ribbon. Still waiting to see if/where it comes back out. Wouldn't buy again for our cat or any cat who tends to eat things other than food...."
1,stupid,"95 reviews got me. sounded wonderful! I waited in sublime anticipation! They ship quickly, but what do you actually get? A long piece of fleece attached to the end of a plastic stick! THAT'S IT FOLKS. Either other folks got something different, or everyone is a friend of the seller. DO NOT BUY. It's a trick."
3,"A bit too short, but still fun","I had a similar toy that my cats loved, but it broke after about 3 years, so I purchased this one because it looks almost identical (probably same manufacturer). So I will do a compare review.What I like about it is that it's much wider than the old one, which makes it less dangerous. It doesn't tangle as easy and doesn't look like it can choke your kitty by accident. It's also shorter, but it's both good and bad. Old one was too long and constantly got caught in things and got lots of knots. This one however is too short, so it's kind hard to ""wiggle"" it. I wish it was just a little longer, but I still think it's a great toy for your cat."
5,Cat loves this ribbon,My cats all love this ribbon. It seems to be very durable so far - my cats pull on the ribbon and it hasn't broken at all. It is plenty long and is fun colors. I would recommend this cat toy.
2,cats not charmed,"I thought the cats would love this as they love the ""fishing pole"" type of toys. They were bored and not interested."
4,"Of all the expensive toys out there, my cat loves this one best!",Sometimes the simplest things are the best. This is a great and inexpensive toy that any cat will love.-1 star because the wand could be slightly less flimsy. It feels as if it could snap if my kitten gives a good tug.
5,My cats love this toy!,"My kitties loved playing with long shoelaces ... until a piece of the plastic end of a shoelace broke off and caused an infection in my kitty's lip! Bought this interactive toy to continue to play their favorite game with them, but safely!All three kitties LOVE this toy and it is completely safe! I have given them to friends who have kitties, too, and the other kitties enjoy playing with this toy, too! Whether they play with you or drag it around on their own! A favorite kitty toy - and I have bought many toys for my cats in the past. Many of which are ignored, but not this one!"
2,$1 item on sale for $4.68,My title says it all. I should have looked at the item description more carefully. Essentially it is a 1 foot long plastic stick with a 3 foot long knit string attached. You are supposed to wave it in front of your cat. It takes two to use this (you and your cat). I got bored with it after a few minutes and left it to the cat to play with. He also got bored with it when his manservant gave up on waving it about. Any 3 foot long strip of terrycloth will do the same for well under a buck.Cat Dancer 301 Cat Charmer Interactive Cat Toy
3,Cat loved it - but is it safe?,"I had this charmer. My cat loved it. She would sit by the closet everynight waiting for me to play with her. The second I turned my back she ate a large portion of it without me knowing until she threw it up the next morning in one piece. The next time she got a hold of this toy without me knowing it until it was too late, she ate about 6 inches of it. It finally came out in her litter box about 3 days later in one piece. Only play with strict supervision."
5,Excellent Cat Toy,"I ordered this through Amazon.com I received the colorthat was advertised,and my delivery was ahead of schedule.My cat Bella loves playing with it,and I am100% satisfied with Amazon.com."
5,Best value cat toy ever!,"The only thing cheaper that's as much fun for my cats is a paper bag. One cat carries it around in her mouth - brings it to me and cries until I play with her with it. She did chew off the first six inches, but apparently now it's just the right length ; It even gets the cranky old man cat (12) to jump in the air. Highly recommend."
2,A sparse overview,"When I buy a book, I want a little depth. This book is a decent summary of the Flash backend, but it's nothing you can't readily find on the web. I HIGHLY recommend a more specific approach--e.g Foundation PHP for Flash by Webster ."
2,Not for SQL or ASP,This item has a lot of good information unless you use a microsoft products. It barely touches ASP and SQL. If it does it assumes that you know PHP so if your going to buy this book make shure you know that.
3,3 1/2 - Not as good as Tey,"It's apparent by reading the other reviews that the previous reviewers enjoyed this book more than I did. I give it 3 1/2 because I do think it was enjoyable read, but I can't say it will last with me for a long time. I feel this is a replica or imitation of Josephine Tey's ""The Daughter of Time"". That book was superb in the fact that it was a unique concept of solving a past mystery and due to the context in World History of the mystery itself. I highly recommend that book. This is the first Morse book I have read, and while I found the characters of the story interesting I can't say that I found the mystery that riveting. I just didn't find the solution that compelling. If you are already a fan of the Inspector Morse novels, I am sure that you will probably enjoy this story & I am clearly in the minority rating it as low as 3 1/2 stars. If you are looking for a intriguing mystery involving history, you should read ""Daughter of Time""."
3,Here we go again!,"I see from reading the other reviews that many others also picked up on the fact that this is probably a new series , and not a stand alone work like ""Ruled Brittania"", hence my title to the review.I would say that anyone who has read any WW-II history or who has seen ""Tora Tora Tora"" remembers that Admiral Nagumo hightailed for home before a 3rd wave was launched against Pearl Harbor. This novel explores the possibilities of the effects of a Japanese invasion instead of a raid. I have either read too much Turtledove lately or the author is losing his edge a little. Much of the plotline seemed to be telegraphed ahead.Not a bad topic for an alternate history novel ; I hope that it doesn't get bogged down in the usual repetitive manner of the American Empire trilogy.Overall, 3 stars. Could have been better , but I'm willing to give this series a chance."
3,THIS CD CANNOT BE USED WITH YOUR MP3 PLAYER,"I loved Resist and was looking forward to this album, but was very disappointed when I discovered I could not transfer the music to my MP3 player. You are forced to install a player from the CD to listen the music on your PC, which is very poor quality. I wish I could get a refund."
5,Great Book!,My son picked this book out at the library about 6 months ago and Loved it so much that every time we were at the library he was looking for it. So we decided to buy it for him for Christmas and now we read it every night before bed :)
3,"Review for ""Sexual Feeling"" by LaToya Jackson","At first listen, I thought this song was ridiculous. LaToya hardly sings in it, and it mostly consisted of moans and sex noises. But as I listened to it more and more, it intrigued me. The beat and melody is actually pretty good and LaToya vocally does well in the few parts where she sings. LaToya tries hard to convince us that she is some sex kitten but it simply doesn't work. Don't buy the single, buy the full album (under the title ""Sexual Feeling"", ""He's My Brother"", ""Bad Girl"", ""Be My Lover"" or ""Why Don't You Want My Love""; they are all the same album). Some of LaToya's other songs are much more promising."
4,a good album new jack swing !!,new jack swing prod like we love !!some background by marc nelson and johnny kemp !!et scratch by clack kent ! yes !!a big album... francky R&B; magazine ( Paris )(..)
2,Huge disappointment!,"Was excited at the prospect of a component video selector with multiple digital audio inputs. While the digital audio works fine (the only reason I gave this two stars), the component inputs degrade just like the previous reviewer mentioned. What's the point of having this if you have to put up with these picture ""hiccups""?! Not recommended unless you have another brand of selector for the video and only use this for the digital audio..."
2,After One Year,"I've been using this AV selector normaly for almost exactly one year, and it did fine untill recently, the inputs on the back began failing. The design of the back panel is poorly thought out, the top row of plugs are under a plastic lip, leaving too little space between plugs and lip, that is purely cosmetic, and when I plugged a ""Monster"" cable into one, it quickley failed, because of the constant pressure. I say failed because it stopped processing the signal properly and gives a distorted image. I am buying a different selector."
5,Music and Michael,"More vintage from the King of Pop. You just can't go wrong. You knew that he was destined for greatness. Such depth!! Such ""soul."""
5,Without a doubt - the best of the best,"Whoopie is just ""Whoopie"" - tells it like it is, means it, lives by it, emulates it, and shares it through her comedic excellence. This particular video is Whoopie at her best, passing on her wisdom through the eyes of a ""true"" American, the real America we all live in. Don't miss it."
3,Good Portrayals but ...,"Too bad this didn't have a better storyline. The actors portrayed their characters well, which is what saved this. Some funny parts ... The Stooges made me sick as a child, but I eventually found some humor in this slapstick - I can't imagine why but LOL... it was okay to watch once."
3,"Short, but entertaining","This record (first issued in 1987) contains all the songs that were the cause for the lp's ""Debil"" and ""Die Ärzte"" to be put on the index (i.e. in Germany they may not be bought by or given to persons aged under 18... even today): ""Claudia I"" plus its successor ""Claudia II""; the infamous ""Schlaflied""; or perhaps the most offending Ärzte song ever, ""Geschwisterliebe"". The compilation is completed by some new tracks, e.g. ""Helmut K."" (which deals with former German chancellor Helmut Kohl beating up his poor wife and so on...). It's amazing how tame most songs on ""Ab 18"" sound today, as you encounter themes worse than these almost everywhere in the news. It's all quite entertaining, but for a fully-priced record, seven songs are really too few - three-star rating, though."
4,Solid Aalbum From a Solid Artist,"Bloom's second album, after his stunning debut ""Riverside,"" was, perhaps, destined to disappoint by comparison, but the fact that it comes so close to matching is a bold testament to his talents.This album begins with the startling ""Mary Watches Everything,"" and ends with the simple, but decidedly NOT silly, love song ""Be Well."" In between we get another impressive set of Luka originals, mixed in with a pair of terrific covers, the Elvis standard ""Can't Help Falling In Love,"" and a wild version of LL Cool J's (yes, that's right) ""I Need Love."" All and all a first rate album from a first rate artist."
3,"Beautiful, but....","This is a beautiful and very solid piece of furniture. You would think it costs $300 to $500. But, the attention to detail is horrible!!! It was missing two of the dowel pieces that are used to hold the shelves in place. One of the holes for a shelf was not even drilled!!! The slots that hold the back piece in place don't line up very well. One of the side pieces has a small section that's not stained. I think someone else said the quality control was weak and I couldn't agree more. But in the end, I am very happy with it."
1,Don't waste your money,"Yes, I know it's inexpensive but trust me you don't want it. It was difficult to put together. You couldn't really tighten the joints with the Allen wrench they give you. The Allen wrench they provide you bent so it wasn't usable. We had another set. The screws stripped almost immediately. It's not been used and is just sitting in a corner with a couple of glasses and bottles in it and is already listing to one side. It's really a shame because even though its really cheap wood it looks great. I'm going to have to throw it out because who wants a tilting cabinet. I'll never buy anything sold by Winsome again."
5,Another Masterpiece by a True Master,"Anyone who is interested in descriptions of various military encounters throughout the ages and written in a style that literally makes the pages flip over by themselves would need to look no further than this book - or, for that matter, any other book by this gifted author. The ten events recounted in this masterpiece are all described in such an engaging and exciting style that it becomes a question of willpower putting the book aside. The descriptions are always lively, detailed and, occasionally, tongue-in-cheek - thus making the reading so enjoyable. Readers who are not familiar with this author's works should allow themselves a real treat and read any one of his books - they will not be disappointed; those who are already familiar with them will know what to expect. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys history and likes to see it come alive - to jump out of the pages on which it is written."
2,Old Rugged Cross cd from Amazon,Much more reasonable than from the concert. This is an old recordingand Clay was not so professional as he is now. I would rate himGREAT.
4,Super Edger,"Bought this to replace an old Weedeater trimmer/edger. It does an excellent job edging and leaves a nice clean edge. Has plenty of horse power and did not appear to be a excessive string eater. Works much better than my cordless Black and Decker edger/trimmer, which just doesn't have enough horsepower or battery life. Well worth the money and I didn't see any other edger/trimmer at this price point that works this well. Highly recommend this product."
1,Junque and Decker,"I used mine for about an hour, in that time it went through two spools, the switch broke and the motor was smoking! I should have known better than to buy a B&D product, from my past experience, they seem to be great at building cheap junk."
4,The Name Fits,"I've only had it for a bit more than a month, but I have a large yard with LOTS of weeds, so I've done LOTS of whacking with it. This, so far, works wonderfully!! It truly is a ""grass hog""."
3,Great product if you manage your expectations,"When I first bought this thing I was amazed at its quality operation. The edging is awesome. That was about 2 years ago (coincidence?).Until I came on here after having the same problem with the line feeder, I thought maybe I was doing something wrong or maybe buying the wrong line. It comes to find out that this is a very common problem with these models. I'm going to try a new spool and see if that helps. I'll report back if I have success. If not I'm movin on to another brand that I'll maybe get more than 2 years out of."
3,Better stock up on string,"I have a small yard so I got a lightweight model. Everything about the Grass Hog works just fine except one thing, the automatic string feed mechanism. I thought that automatic string feed was a great convenience when I bought it, but after just one use, it spent the entire spindle. I'm going to return this so I can get one a trimmer that requires bumping. At least that way I won't have to buy a new spindle each time I do some trimming."
3,good and bad,"I've had two of these grasshog trimmers. They do an excellent job, but I have to replace the string too often like someone else mentioned. It does a good real good job edging with the fold out metal clip. HOWEVER, this clip broke on my last one which is why I bought another. After having this one for two seasons, the clip bent out of shape and is now useless. I've searched and searched online for a replacement (it is about a $1 piece of metal) and can't find a replacement for this one part. I will probably have to now buy a seperate edger."
3,Ok trimmer for the price.,"I have had the GH600 for a year now. The trimmer function is pretty good. The edger function is frustrating. I go through an entire spool when edging. The autofeed does not seem to work as well when edging, so I end up angling the tool in weird ways and use up the string quickly. The metal guard works well as long as the auto-feed is functioning properly. I wouldn't dare try to wind a spool manually. The vibrations can get pretty bad as well. If I trim and edge my entire lawn in one outing, my arm muscles are left fatigued and shaking the rest of the day, and usually sore the next day. I got the GH600 because I thought with the light weight and ergonomic design my girlfriend would be able to use it, but after seeing the difficulties I have had with it, she won't go anywhere near the thing."
5,Excellent Trimmer and Edger for the Budget!,This trimmer works great and the edger is awesome. I love the no bump feature but you might tend to go through the string spool faster. I have had no problemscutting my grass and large weeds around my house and I have a lot. This is a great product for the money.
1,Grass Hog,"I bought one afew days ago, first day all the line go out in cuestion of seconds, put another line and same. I went to the store for my money, no problem with that but they said is one of the worst equipment made by B&D ever! The capacity of the line wheel is so small that you'll have to recharge 5 or 6 times to cut a 2x2 square meter of grass. If you want to waist money, try with machine!"
1,black & decker gh600 grass hog timmer from amazon,"this was a dog . worked for about two months and then had problems with the line feed . no matter what i did, the line would not feed. even got the pre-lined spools and they wouldn't feed either. this was a waste of money. other reviewers indicated that they had problems with the line feed, so i was warned of the problem and i still got one. will not buy another b&d trimmer again."
2,SENIORS CAN USE THIS TRIMMER,"This is a great tool for senior ladies like me who aren't very strong or handy with tools. This is the first string trimmer I've owned and if I can handle it, anyone can. I've had it 2 months now and it handles the tall grass and even small saplings in my yard beautifully - I have a wooded area, not a lawn. I did experience the excessive string feeding some posters wrote about (with a gash on my shin even through thick new jeans) but found that the spool cap had come off and when I replaced it, no more problems. I just wish the string were not so expensive and lasted longer.Later addition: I take back a couple of stars. When I ran out of string, it was nearly impossible to wind more onto the spool or to replace it. The cap kept popping off and spinning across the yard, so the string became tangled and I had to call on mechanically gifted friends to put it back together. I would not buy this trimmer again."
1,Don't Waste Your Money.,"This product was a nightmare. Did not last one year. Released line at a violent pace that would break off and whip you in the leg. If it wasn't wasting line, it was jamming up every 2 minutes forcing you to stop and release it by hand. The excess line that was continuously released proved to be too much abuse for the guard and it snapped in two. I have never had a lawn care product fall apart so quickly. I will never purchase a Black & Decker trimmer again."
1,Pass on this model,This is my second grass hog trimmer I am NOT satisfied at all with it. The first one lasted 8 years and worked perfectly no complaints. Among some of my problems with it are: 1) It uses 3x's as much line as my old one. 2) The replacement line is too expensive and difficult to use. 3) It jumps all over the place and does not cut a nice straight edge as my old one. 4) and MOST IMPORTANTLY it bites so wear long pants. I'm seriously considering trashing it and repairing my old one. Please pass on this model and save yourself some money. I wish I had followed this advice prior to purchasing it.
2,Automatic Line Feeder is a joke,"Bought this trimmer (though not at amazon) and thought the ""no bumping required"" automatic line feeder would be helpful. What a mistake. It makes sure there's always one inch of line available and that's about it. I hate to spend money on another one, but this is garbage."
3,"Great product, works well, but battery does not last long!!","We bought this item for ease of use, no cords to lug around or gas to refill. It works pretty good, but the batteries do not last long at all. We have a small piece of property (50x150)...and only a small section of grass in the front and back yards....and it takes 3 battery packs to edge and trim around the fence and walkways everytime we do it. God forbid you forgot to put one of those batteries on a charger...then you cant even get your yard done. The standard charger takes 3 hours to re-charge. I just found a fast charger for the B&D 18v....takes 90 minutes to re-charge the batteries....but still, if you run out of ""juice"" you are stuck for an hour and a half at minimum waiting for them to recharge. If you have a large piece of property and decide to buy this product....make sure you have several back up packs and fast chargers on hand or you will get aggravated quick when the batteries die!"
1,Most ridiculous price I have ever seen on this item,"This is a great idea for small kids, no carving. However, this is the most ridiculous price I have ever seen. They are clearly price gouging, just go to walmart or target"
5,A NIGHT TO REMEMBER,I don't have this CD but I watched this concert live on New Hampshire Public Television and it was AWESOME!! What more would you expect from Jim Brickman?? His masterpieces are never less than spectacular and you won't be disappointed with the selections on this CD either. Is he ever less than great?? If you missed this show on TV then buy this album!!!!
3,A Nice Collection,"4 complete shows from each of the years 1967-1970. Some of the songs repeat. The sound quality ifuniformly quite good, some excellent. A must have for die-hard fans. Casual fans may not be so interested."
3,Good but not great.....,"Good but not great.....Loma Linda Fried Chik'N with Gravy, 13-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)....I paid $63.57 for 12 of these I also bought several of the other products from this brand....They are Heavy ALL were shipped in On large box...SEVERAL cans have HUGE dents in them...I will try frying them...as others have suggested!"
4,Another important book on the role of intuition in decision making,"Klein does another excellent job in his continuing exposition of the importance of the role of intuition in practical,everyday decision making at home, on the job,under stressful conditions, as well as areas like economics.This statement sums up the book:""You will learn how to use your intuition to handle ambiguity in Chapter 8,How to Manage Uncertainty""(Klein,p.19;see also pp.119-120 for his emphasis on the role of confidence when faced by ambiguous or uncertain situations).The major criticism I have is that the earlier work in this area done by J M Keynes,Frank Knight and D Ellsberg is not mentioned anywhere in the book.Klein needs to incorporate this work into the corpus of his research,even if only for historical purposes."
5,Mysterio....it's a mystery why I found this in a bargain bin,"Just pulled this one out of the stack tonight and it still sounds fresh to me.Of course I was looking for just a crumb of that Echo sound... and for me, Mysterio delivered much of what I liked with E and the Bunnymen. McCulloch's voice still rips chills down to the gut and back up the spine. These 11 tracks have a great range of sound and rhythms.'Damnation' , 'Honeydrip' and 'Dug for Love' are 3 of my favorites.Clearly this one never caught on .... can't even show an image for the CD up top, but if you find this in a bargain bin like I did 10 years ago.....BUY IT!!!!"
4,Powerful,"Living Space is a series of takes from the same 1965-sessions that produced the fine ""Transition""-cd. The band was at the height of its powers, and it seemed there were no limits to what it could to. The title track features overdubbed saxophone - it is quite beautiful and not like anything else Coltrane ever did. All the tracks are powerful and very rewarding - and it is only judged by the groups own towering standards that you could call some of the playing slightly routine."
3,Uneven collection short ecological horror stories,"""Earth Strikes Back"" is a colection of short horror fiction stories that vary widely in quality. My favorite is ""I Remember Me,"" a chilling tale that envisions the end of the world in the form of a disease that slowly robs every human being of his or her memory. This is a good read for those who like horror fiction."
3,Serves the purpose,"Wouldn't call it ""new"" but serves our purpose. Binding needed glue and pages were yellowed, but book was intact with no tears."
4,This does not wear off. Next best thing to an expensive reglaze.,My only disppointment was the tone was slightly off in my well lit bathroom. On my other tub I cannot notice where my chip once was. Best if you use very sparingly. After first coat dries add a second if needed.
4,Great Book,Great read for people of any age. Total escapism and pure entertainment.. Books would make some great movies
5,Harry Potter meets humm....Godfather :),"This is a very good book. It is fast moving and is very interesting. It is about fairies, and magic but also includes robbery, guns and fist fights. It is about a kid mastermind who wants to......well just read the book! You wont regret it."
3,"Do not be fooled by the hype, Harry Potter this is not",The hype surrounding this book suggests it is a kind of Harry Potter with fairies and it is really a grown-up book disguised as a kids book. I would disagree. This lacks the subtlety and complexity of Harry Potter and while the story is fast-paced it is truly childish.
2,Not Meant for Kids under 14!,"The book was well thought out and well written, however it was pretty gory and graphic in some parts. As a teacher I would not recomend this book to anyone under the age 14, it's simply not appropriate."
5,A great start,"I kept seeing this book series in the book store and every time I passed buy I would pick it up, almost buy it and then put it back down. I am very glad that I finally purchased this book. It is a great start to a great series. The amount of research that Eoin goes into for his books are great. You really dont think about that for all the little side notes about locations and tech comments he had to research all of that.The characters in this book are what make it such a great story. The first book follows young Artemis as he kidnaps Holy Short (a fairy) and demands gold. This books sets up for the books to follow and the mixture of fact to fantasy is great. The fairies and their technology is fantastic and fun, while Artemis is clever, witty and all around fun.This is a great book for kids who like magic mixed with modern."
4,Absolutely Hilarious!,"I really liked this book because of how funny it was. But it seemed like there were only a few segments where I was really into it. But during these parts, I was glued to the pages, and I think that they, combined with the outstanding humor, make this book worth reading."
5,D'avit,Atemis Fowl is one of the best books I've ever read. It has a lot of cool Fairy-Facts and a this was the very first time I heard of a book. This book combindes the magic of fairys with modern technology. The fairys where funny and cool and Holly Short was one of the best. I think all 12-year-olds should read this book.
3,A Delightful Read,"After finishing the Potter series, I quickly looked for another escape from the everyday world. ""Artemis Fowl"" offers this quality in a book. eoin colfer paints an wonderful story about a brilliat child criminal. As if this weren't enough to spark interest, he adds in an intriguing world of fairies and goblins. This book is no ""Harry Potter"", but even so it has its own imaginative appeal."
4,wonderful!,I found this book very suspencful and interesting. Athough to me it was a little hard to follow. I also think that the characters were NOT well stated very well. For the lingest time I thought the old drunk fairy was the young fairy Holly. Over all I was very pleased with this book.
5,good book,"If you like fantasy, harry potter, gohsts, youll love Artemis fowel Artemis fowl is a genius, a criminal mastermind, and a millionaire the most shocking thing is hes only twelve years old But when he kidnaps captian Holly Short of the LEPrecon unit he dosent know what hes dealing with. In a great scheme to restore his families fortune Artemis Fowl makes a very amusing tale."
3,Couldn't get into it,"I bought this book because it came highly recommended to Harry Potter fans. From the brief description I read about it, I thought it sounded like some fun, light reading. I figured I'd zip though it. But I just couldn't get interested. How can they expect me to care about the main character when he's an obnoxious 12 year old millionaire? He's nasty to nearly everyone he meets. And he's also supposed to be a child genius, so he talks to everyone like they're stupid. It's far from enchanting, to say the least. The story follows Artemis as he attempts to take over the fairy world or something like that. To be honest, I could barely get through half of this book. Artemis is repellent. The real story in this book, though, isn't really about Artemis, it's about Holly, the fairy that he kidnaps. She's the real hero: smart, funny, and interesting. She almost makes reading about Artemis bearable!"
4,Artimus Fowl is awsome,"I love this book its one of my favorites it has plenty of twist in the story.I would put this right up there with Harry Potter which is also one of my favorite book series not to minchin the hobit book series.anyways the reason I gave this book only 4 stars was because the faries keep downing humans,but I would buy a sequil of Artimus Fowl"
4,"Harry Potter Substitute-slightly amusing, but no Harry...","This book, an obvious Harry Potter wanna-be, just makes the grade (in my opinion) to be a Harry Potter Sustitute....This book has just enough humor and intigue to make the grade. Some may love it-some may hate it-it's just that kind of book. But it's worth a try...."
3,One of the worst in the series,"I am a big fan of the Artemis Fowl series, and, after reading all the books several times, have to say this one is the worst. If it didn't detail characters and backgrounds, as well as setting the scene, I would recommend skipping this book altogether. Even if this book doesn't appeal, continue with the story and then judge the books."
5,Great Book,"This book is awesome. Read it. Eoin Colfer could rival Rowling as an author. Their writing styles are similar, and not just in the kid fantasy element. This book is probably deeper than Harry Potter, too, because you see things from the bad guy's point of view, causing the book to be less set out in black and white than Harry Potter. Read it now."
1,I deleted this book,I didn't want to read it. Too much fantasy in this world. I'm sure its good to others but not me.
3,Give it up for the criminal genius!!,"Artemis Fowl is one of the most complex books I have ever read. It is complex, but it is also an enjoyable book to read. It is a book that is totally fictional but in a fun way, with no aliens but spirits. Who could imagine that a twelve year old criminal could be so ingenius and at the same time be a killer? This book is a fairy tale with a bit of terror included but in a good way, not in a scary way. This book would be recommended to kids about the age of twelve and above. The beginning of the book might sound boring or complicated, but if you have a bit of patience you will realize that you can't judge a book by its cover. I hope that everyone who reads this book will not be disappointed."
1,Please don't waste your time or brain,Amen to all those who rated this book 1 star because 0 wasn't available. Wish that I had read those reviews before I endured the book.
2,"Cliche, out dated but fun, definitely for young adults","The title says it all, full of cliches and out dated ones at that even though this book is only 10 years old. The language and themes are definitely young adult, unlike other young adult books which have adult themes spun within the story to keep us older fantasy readers enthused. However, the book was fun and plodded along fast enough that it kept me interested. However, the first book is usually the best so I won't be reading any further in this series. Side note, his Douglas Adams / Hitchhikers family authorized book was reasonably well done. He is no Douglas Adams though."
4,Great Young Adult Fiction,"Really enjoyed this book. I enjoy YA fiction, and this fits well. Quick-paced and funny with intelligent and recognizable characters. A fun way to spend an afternoon or two."
5,Amazing album that seems to have faded into history . . .,"Before seeing the movie Lost in Translation, I had never heard a My Bloody Valentine song. I've discovered that I have been missing out.This album is twelve years old, but the music is relevant today. Loveless was critically acclaimed in its time, but because of the band's concern that the album was too good to improve upon, another was never made. That's a shame because this one is absolutely fantastic.If you're comfortable with bands like Sigur Ros and Radiohead, you will have no trouble appreciating this album. Otherwise it may take a few listens to enjoy. Regardless, it's difficult to deny the overall quality of Loveless."
3,"Boring start, good middle, boring end","Tracks 5-8 are excellent and memorable. The start and end I find boring and forgettable. The album's sound is gigantic wall-of-noise distorted guitars, floaty vocals, a bit psychedelic overall. It's heavy, hazy stuff. Horribly overrated, but not a horrible album, just alright. The production could be a lot better, maybe I just don't get what they're trying to do, it sounds like it's in mono but at the same time trying to sound huge and it doesn't as good as it could."
5,This is music to worship God with.,"This is spiritual! Loveless is the album of albums to get of the nineties. Not ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", not even ""OK Computer"". How can I say such a thing. Well I think about how often I go back to my collection and how often I select ""Loveless"" over the the two aforementioned. It really impresses me how the burn out factor doesn't really apply to this CD. I can say that being owner of more than 600 CD's, there are only a handful of bands who've left a long lasting impression on me like MBV."
1,Very jumbled over-layered fuz.,"So amny people love this album but I think it's one of the most over rated albums ever.Take a guitar, turn the reverb and volume all the way up and let it go over the vocals and you have this album.Can't understand a single thing that is ""sung"" and the music sounds like it was recorded on a tape recorder that the batteries were about dead in.Almost ever song sounds alike.Sorry, but I think this album stinks."
5,this album will love you,the title of the album is misleading. this album will love you during those moments when you really need love.
2,I think it's interesting...,"So many rave reviews, I was just curious. How could I have missed out on such a fantastic album for 10 years? So I picked it up, and just took a listen. I see the origniality, and it is definitely unique/interesting, but I keep thinking there is something wrong with my speakers. It's a lot more ""lo fi"" than I had imagined. I mean, compared to most recordings today, it sounds like it was mixed on a boom box. I don't know. Maybe like some other reviewers have said, I will eventually come back to it and find it ""hauntingly beautiful"" or something, but after the first listen I am frankly kind of annoyed."
2,"Critics, like most of this album, suck","""Only Shallow"" and ""Sometimes""... those two songs are great, and they are example of what this album SHOULD'VE sounded like. Instead, we get 9 other tracks of buzzsaw guitars and ungodly feedback. In fact, the feedback is so irritating, suffocating, and unsexual that it makes JAMC's ""Psychocandy"" sound like a gentle lullaby. I don't know how they got $500,000 to make this album... I could make this entire record if I just got drunk enough to want to stand next to my amps and play power-chords. ""Loveless"" isn't an awful album, and the ideas are there, but they're not executed at all. If this was the band's vision of perfect than it should be no wonder why they haven't made another album in 16 years. This is just another example of the media hype-machine and spineless critics who either want too much to be different/unique, or are too afraid to form an opinion of their own. MBV should take a class taught by Mogwai or Sonic Youth, the real engineers of sounds."
5,Just wish it were Vinyl.,"Although the sound set-up I got deffinately makes up for lack of a Vynil copy, this CD is still great, one of the best. Some great songs on here if you got the taste for them. There's a good chance you'll be glad you have this disc simply for one song, or a group of them. I strickly bought this for about 2 songs, heard of 3, and kinda just fell in love with the cd. Its ashame such bliss was short lived and thus, a fanbase left with youtube and internet archival glory of such greatness. Would deffinately say stick to Vinyl if your the type who has to puke durring a punk LP due to horrible production. Otherwise, be prepared... And Just Enjoy..."
4,Groundbreaking Album,But I'm not sure I'll listen to it much. More influential than 'listenable.' Bought it because Bob Mould cites it as one of his influences in the music of his band Sugar. Immediately understood the reference when I listened to it - but also saw how he took the influence and applied it against his band's music more succesfully.
5,6 stars,"For me, by far the most impressive album in music history. I'll tell you though. I bought this album, listened to it, and wondered what all the fuss was about. Well maybe I should through it in again. Hmm. That's an interesting sound on that song. Maybe I should play this first song again. Wasn't there something interesting there? Repeat this process for 1 month and then the CD doesn't leave my side.Loveless is my Desert Island Disk. Everything else I buy is icing on my collection. I feel like I've jumped into a pool of syrup when I listen to this. Buy it. Listen to it. Give it at least a month if you aren't moved.Sometimes I feel the lack of production after this album by the band must be because what on earth could they do after this?"
4,What is there to say...,"...that hasn't already been said? In many ways, the perfect album. To the reviewer who declared Kevin Shields MIA, check out the new Primal Scream album, he guests on that. He also is touring with the band, engaging in his legendary guitar wizardry. Shields plans to work on the new J Mascis (of Dinosaur Jr) album. He also recently remixed the Yo La Tengo Single, 'Autumn Sweater.' And no, there will be no new MBV album this year."
5,One of the best noise albums ever,"Well, everyone else has pretty much summed it up. This is one of the most creative, beautiful, and influental albums of all time. It would be imposible to list all the bands that have been influenced by this band, but some are Sugar,Swervedriver,Sebadoh,Radiohead,Slint,Mogwia, etc. Kevin Sheilds is without a doubt one of the most brilliant guitarists ever, up there with Lee Ranaldo. This album ranks up with Sonic Youth's Daydream Nation, Dinosaur Jr. Your Living All OVer Me, Pavement Wowee Zowee, Velvet Underground White Light/White Heat, Pixies Doolittle, etc. as one of the greatest albums ever. And to the person who wanted to know what the term shoegazer meens, I am not positive but I read that the early shoegazer bands, like Jesus and Mary Chain would perform entire concerts while staring at their shoes."
3,Cute,"Well every Christmas I buy my dad a Harley coffee cup, so I looked for the best deal. I didn't read the description and thought I was getting 4 Harley coffee cups for $25, but I was wrong:( by the time they were in my home town I read that they were shot glasses that hold 2ounces. Well my mom collects shot glasses, so these are hers now and I had to make a trip down to our local Harley shop for my dads coffee cup for $17. I haven't opened the package to the glasses yet, but I think they are a cute idea as well as cute;)"
5,Droppin' Bows On Em,"Ludacris is one of the best new artist rap has had in awhile .Luda is a great lyricist . His lyrics are cleaver and sharp .The production on this cd is nothin less than amazing . With Timbaland , The Neptunes and JD as producers , you know that this cdis gonna be a chart topper . Ludacris even does some producing himself on the tracks Hood Stuck and Catch Up . This is a cd that you definetly need to add to your collection . I cant wait until his new album Word Of Mouf comes out . You know that album is gonna bang for real ."
2,"a few good hooks, but nothin new","Yeah, ""Southern Hospitality"" has a cool beat and there are other tracks that vibe, but the reality? This guy is nothin new. Just a lot of the same lyrics over and over and over and...you get the point, he's got nothin interesting or intelligent or origianl to say...Dirty South? yeah ok...boring South...yeah that too."
1,Nothing new here,"This whole album is dense, unoriginal, gratuitous and actually pretty boring stuff. Apart from the amazing What Is Your Fantasy, Ludacris, who has an excellent voice that is totally distinguishable from other rappers, delivers nothing new to the modern hip hop scene. Avoid."
3,Decent Effort,Ludacris does a good job here as he ably and greatly handles his business of rapping to us. The songs are pretty tight although some of them are kinda tiring and/or boring but there are the standouts like the hits WHAT'S YOUR FANTASY and SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY which are good party songs. Some of the other good jams are the interludes and the WHATS YOUR FANTASY REmix. THis is a pretty good effort.
5,What a way to start off a great career!,"I bought this cd in Febuary of this year because I wanted a good cd to listen to on a long car trip that I was going on. I purchased this and Word of Mouf. This cd is amazing. The beats are awesome, but that is not even the best part. In every song, Luda is off the freaking chain. He flows so well throughout the whole album that it is almost unbelievable. He also has an instantly recognizable voice and he has tons of punchlines in every song. Each song has a great hook (something that Luda has become known for) and has funny lyrics. My favorite song would have to be Game Got Switched, Phat Rabbit, or Southern Hospitality. I highly recommend this cd to everyone because it is a dirty south classic!"
2,why does music have to cuss?,"I like ludacris, but what I don't like about him is that he cusses. He cusses left and right. First of all, what makes music so good if it cusses. I like most rappers, like, nelly ludacris. I also like christian rap. Some good ones to look up are....Pax 217..kj-52...christology...john reuben..If you are going to get a cd that cusses, think twice about it, or get one thats says (CLEAN VERSION."
4,One of the better hip-hop albums in 2000,"After I heard his first single ""What's your Fantasy"" I took a risk in buying the whole album. I would have to say this is underated making it suprisingly one of the better albums in 2000. First off this album is mostly worth buying for it's beats and production, the lyrics are ok, but the bottom line is, gets Ludicris his message through in every song. The best song on on the album is clearly ""What's your Fantasy"", the remix is kinda hot too. The other tight tracks include ""Hood Stuck"", ""U Got A Problem?"", ""Southern Hospitality""and ""Stick Em Up"". I strongly feel that this is a great start for the Def Jam South Recordings. All Hip-Hop fans should seriously give this album a shot!"
1,Battery EXPLODED!!,I ORDERED 2 OF THESES BATTERIES AND 1 CHARGER IN APRIL 2009 AND THE BATTERY EXPLODED INTO A 1000 PIECES WHILE CHARGING TODAY CAUSING A FIRE IN MY KITCHEN!! THE CHARGER WAS DAMAGED TOO. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TOO CHEAPLY MADE REPLICA OF THE SONY BATTERY.
2,sub-par product...You're better off using caffiene.,"It's not ""complete garbage"" LoL...But, pretty close. No androgenic effect whatsoever...A mild stimulating effect but easily duplicated with a cup of joe. (not as potent as the littany of ""energy drinks"" on the market.) Testosterone amplifier? LoL...Don't waste your money, or more importantly, your time on this lame-duck product."
4,Raw energy,"Probably one of my favourite Coltrane records. Lots of Raw energy from Coltrane and what appears to be ""stream of consciousness"" playing. The interplay between piano, drums and bass here is also amazing. This is an astounding rhythm section. All the players here seem to be at the top of their game. Chasin' the Trane and Impressions are absolutely amazing."
3,Not exactly as I remember it.,"The video quality is great, but for some reason I remember the game being more linear and far less random. For example for every wrong move you make (ie - death) you get sent to a random area of the castle, make two mistakes in a row and you really have no idea how far away you are from finishing. I don't regret purchasing it, but I can't see myself playing this for more than 5-10 minutes at a time.I'm looking forward to Space Ace, a game I have spent considerably more time on back in the day."
2,sadden,"I was really excited about this game being out. Now my rating isn't based on the game it's based on a current situation. It doesn't play in my HD player. It skips scenes randomly and acts up. I have checked the disc for scratches, there are none. I am currently in the process of trying to get it replaced. I am curious if anyone else has run into this situation with this game. It freezes at the opening before the main menu and when I Skip forward there isn't a play or game menu, when I am able to get it going it is skimming scenes right away.I used to play this in the arcade I know it fairly well and was forever excited to try it again... I, like I said, hope I can replace it."
5,Love it,"His style is very original and unique, I think that's what makes his music so loved by even people who dont' understand Turkish. Which in itself is amazing. He's truly one of a kind and I don't think he's hit his peak yet. I can't wait to see more from him. He's loved by everyone."
5,"Progressive, modern and contagious","I am into Spanish, Greek, Turkish and Arabic modern music. At this point I believe I could buy Tarkan's next CD without sampling it first. He is one of the few artist I've come acrossed where I enjoy 100 % of the songs in the CD. BUY DUDU, it's worth every penny. I have ""Tarkan"" and ""Karma."" All of these 3 Cds provide a blend of sensual, upbeat and contemplative mood. Hope he keeps up the high standard quality music production. I wish I knew Turkish.JS"
4,Wonderful but not the best...,"It really is asinine to try and compare Pulp's sound to Rialto,like some of our fellow reviewers. How can one compare the deep sensual whispers of unrequited passion and voyeuristic intent to the cleaned up, naive, but very catchy boyish sound of Rialto? They are great...in their own right. Personally the rest of the albumn does not live up to the euphoric pain of ""Monday Morning 5:19"", but is worth listening to by far."
5,best soundtrack ever,This soundtrack was released when i worked at a music store so we played it over the store's sound system. It quickly became a favorite. I liked it so much I tracked down a copy of the movie (import only). It has since become my favorite movie of all time. I have bought countless copies to share with friends.
1,High price for low quality,"There are more comprehensive guides available for less money (or free, even). It is printed on paper that is just a step above newsprint. Save your money for a more complete guide."
4,exceptionaly useful,Quite useful with a minimum of travel-guide blather.Will prevent a first-time visitor from getting lost on the way to most places a tourist wants to go. Clear directions on using the Metro in a readable size (the 'freebies' from the Metro system are great if you are travelling with a magnifying glass).Time for it to be up-dated or I would give it 5 stars.
4,Lamp Good for Your Eyes,"I had a halogen desk lamp which I felt the light was too strong and the bulb was too hot. It even melt part of the top of my LCD monitor case when the light touch the case. So I decided to look for one which has the right brightness and ""cold"". I found Panasonic SQT917S601 Electric Fluorescent in ... Since it use fluorescent technology,it should not be too hot. In addition, it claim to be good for your eyes, so I decided to give it a try.I have been using it for 3 weeks and I am glad it met my expectation of (1) light good for my eyes (2) not too hot to melt my LCD case."
5,World Class Lighting and Engineering,Was looking for an affordable inveter lamp and tried this out after the good reviews. I would say the lighting is much much better on the eyes than conventional incandescent lamps. Really well designed foldable soft light feature too. Panasonic quality and reliability a big plus. Perfect desk lamp and takes up minimal space thanks to smart design. Highly recommended
3,Rhinestones came off :(,"I got this for my Yorkie and the X-Small fits her perfectly! She's around 5lbs and measurement from neck to base of tail is around 8.5"". Her girth is around 11-12"".The only problem is the pink belt which goes around the waist of the dress was too short that when she walks, it tends to go up where the pink rhinestones are -- because of this, the rhinestones which forms the bone image slowly came off :(Now, I only have the word DIVA complete and I plan to just remove the bone image on the dress. My Yorkie just wore it once.They should make the belt a little longer so that it will be a little loose around the waist. Other than that, it was really a cute dress :)"
3,Not exactly what I expected,"The duvet cover is quite soft as is to be expected, however the Arabian red in my case at least...turned out to be more of an Orange colour. Not at all like what is pictured. The quality however is excellent and described perfectly. I was just expecting the colour to be more vibrant and well...RED"
4,It's a $20 duvet but not bad for the price.,"Well, I don't know if I'd call it luxurious but it is OK for the price. The better your comforter the better this duvet will seem.Some threading was unraveling around the button holes on mine but no big deal. It also is pretty true to the color picture. The close up looks a little darker than actual.I've seen a very similar duvet at Target on sale for $25-$30."
5,B-R-I-L-L-I-A-N-T,"The Figgs have gone and done it again- yep - chalk up another glittering rock achievement for those boys. Stacked with smokin' pop tunes, Sucking might be their best record yet. The lyrical sensitivity yet sense of humor matched with rock-rooted artful songwriting makes for a brilliant product. These boys have done their homework and just keep getting better. (Great records must have been on the turntables at all times- Kinks, Elvis Costello, Stones etc) What is so unfortunate about the listening samples offered to you here is that you can't hear the entire album!! You miss out on consecutive songs like ""gonna get out"", ""running in place"", and ""dance lesson"" that make you keep reaching for the volume knob. If you have any doubts about purchasing their albums, go see the band if you can.Their live performance will knock yer socks off."
5,BUY IT,"These guys are just amazing. They are way above the average rock/pop/punk band in terms of their song writing, technical prowess and ability to complement one another.Many influences were mentioned in the above reviews, but I would like to add one more - (old) Kiss, which is especially evident on the vocals of ""Opening Night"" and to some extent ""Dance Lesson.""These guys are so good that they could easily get in with another major record label if they were willing to sell out.The Figgs are the real deal."
2,Where is the complete collection?,"Great cartoon, poor release. It is crazy only releasing 4 episodes. The complete series would fit on a two disc set. I love this show but I don't think I can bring myself to buy it a disc at a time."
2,Only one button works,I quikly recieved my order and programming was very easy since I have the same remote only black in color. For some reason with dip swithes set exactly as on original one only one button works. I've noticed that revision # is different on gray and black openers. I will try a couple more times and if no lack - will return it.
1,Not up to par,We LOVE Veggietales videos and have enjoyed all of them. We were very disappointed with The Angry Eyebrows video. The storyline did not match up to the high quality of the other videos in the Larryboy and Veggietales series. We hope that the next video will be back on track.
5,Great book...hope he does more like this.,This is a good book for history buffs as well as for someone learing about history. The photographs in this book allow you to see the current environment and then the old environment live picture within that picture. I hope this author does more of these books as well as does this one in a larger version like a coffee table book. Excellen!
4,Straightforward and mostly useful,"The book's extensive information on the Chick Lit genre itself read like a Master's thesis, but its advice on organizing & writing your novel and getting it published was interesting, detailed, and helpful.Tips for structuring plot were very thoroughly explained. The author's extremely organized approach to writing may work for some but not others. I'm pretty ""Type A"" myself, so it made sense to me - and employing some of her suggested techniques has kept my writing focused and prevented a lot of wasted time in rewrites.Bottom line: Skim the first half (on Chick Lit genre), and slow down to focus on the second half (writing and publishing tips)."
2,A disappointing 2nd album,"While I lived The Waterlillies' first album, this follow-up effort succeeds only in perhaps 2 of the tracks, and those 2 aren't nearly as good as anything on the earlier collection, alas..."
3,Get the Soundtrack,This is a spin off of some sorts. The soundtrack to the Film (of the same name) is a really good release. This album is good but the soundtrack is one of the best of his CD's. RELESE SUB UNDERGROUND ON CD with something else SATURN.
5,It's a wonder of self,"The ""Wonders of Solitude"" is a magnificent discovery of how to be at peace with one's self. A self-discovery of how wonderful it is to be alone, to reveal a deeper and spiritual awareness of ourselves. It brings a true sense of fullfillment to the word ""solitude"", without any feeling of deprivation or lonliness. Truly great reading material for anyone who is uncomfortable with being alone or in need of soul searching."
4,I give these as baby shower gifts,"I frequently give BrianBoy tapes and CD's as gifts to friends with small children and as baby shower gifts. The music is fun and zippy. Kids love these tunes and seem to really like the way BrianBoy records and performs them. The CD's contain the words to the songs and I enjoy sitting with my nephews and letting them sing along and read the words. A fun CD at a good price, in my opinion. I just bought 5 to have on hand for kids birthdays, friends baby showers and other gift needs. I hope BrianBoy comes out with a second CD some time, as our kids have this one completely memorized."
5,First for me.,"I have owned a Delta unisaw for 3 years. Hard maple is one of my main wood choices. After recieving these blades, I now understand how a rip blade differs from a cutoff blade. I used to get great cuts from my first Freud blade, but now, ripping butcherblock is effortless, and clean. I suspect during cabinet building with some of my cherry stock, the combination blade will be more a fixture in the saw, however, this weekend is time for prefinished oak flooring, where the 80 tooth finecut blade makes cuts as clean as...as it should be."
5,Great Necessary Addition,"I LOVE my Pork Pie seats... but they would not be the Only chairs in our house without the back. After we got it my husband and I fought over using it, for everything... So we now have them as our kitchen chairs as well as office chairs. We need to get 2 more!!! It totally makes the chair. A MUST have for any seat. We have never had a problem with it falling/slipping for bending. It's very sturdy and my husband leans back in his chair against it."
2,Intriguing concepts wrapped in a sputtering plot,"As she does in ""An Alien Light"", Kress explores humanity and what defines it via the lens of an alien microscope. Unfortunately, in this novel, the concepts become less weighty when bogged down in a sluggish plot and superficial characters. In 300 pages, Kress fails to provide the reader with enough background, depth, or empathy to understand the central characters' motives or rationalizations for the actions they take. And the conclusion leaves one unsatisfied and somewhat flat - rather than pondering her central question (what defines humanity), one is left uncaring.To read about the same concepts in a better package, I recommend you read An Alien Light, or better yet, the Beggars series."
2,smaller than expected,"This item came quickly and is very cute, however the bank is smaller than I expedted it to be."
1,It's not the original recording,"I disappointed with Kenny Rogers ""Back Home Again"", because it's not original recording and the sound is not good.It's copy"
4,"Ahhh, this is nice...","This cd right here is something that you should buy. Ive just got into metal, but i have noticed that it all usually sounds the same.. Theres something to this though.. I enjoy Strapping young lad, and the dudes voice kinda reminds me of that. Good stuff...Oh, and the cd case kicks ass as well."
1,too many notes?,"""Too many notes"" is what Emperor Carl Josef said to Mozart. I remembered that here because is in these improvisational treatments of beloved familiar tunes, I cannot distinguish the original melodies."
5,A GREAT (Yes I mean GREAT) CD,"I never understood why Kid Creole never became a superstar. This collection shows off the group's stuff really well. It's a shame that Doppleganger isn't available on CD as it is probably his best. I often put this CD on at our parties and people always ask ""who is that guy?"" Buy it, play it, enjoy it!"
2,"Basic stuff, though well-written","On the good side, this book is well-written, flows nicely from paragraph to paragraph, and is very easy to read. On the bad side, I simply didn't find anything deeply insightful like I was expecting. It is fairly simplistic book about developing a better relationship with yourself, and is probably best suited for someone who is starting out on this path. As someone who has done a bit of self-analysis and self-improvement over the years, I feel this book simply didn't offer anything new or have enough compelling content to earn a recommendation. If you are looking for something that is more meaty, I think there are better choices out there."
5,Read This Book!,"I'm pushing sixty. I've been in and out of therapy and have been reading self-help books all my life. I ordered this (the CD version) with little hope. Not much seems new anymore.Surprise! I was almost immediately engrossed. Luciani is wonderful. Using plain talk and simple analogies, he sums up what all the niche-marketers and long-winded ""experts"" are currently trying to sell us as ""new."" There's nothing new here. But Luciani's approach is refreshing, smart, and absolutely sane.If you want to make a change (or changes) in your life, ""The Power Of Self Coaching"" will absolutely make a difference in your approach and give you information and activities that will not only show you how to change, but will inspire you to change.How can anyone not love an author who wants his epitaph to read ""I'd Rather Be Reading This""?"
5,i_m_heman,"if only every band could put together an album like this. despite the fact that i have thought every rancid album was sweet, after getting such a bad rap on life won't wait, rancid really bounced back and displayed a true meaning of punk rock. something that is almost completely forgotten in todays scene. the incredible energy exhibited from track 1-22 blows the mind and leaves one wanting more of what true punk is all about. if u like punk, then u shouldn't even think of not getting this cd. one of the best buys in years for anybodys cd collection."
4,Rancid! Rancid! Rancid!,"I'll be the first to admit that since ....Out Come The Wolves I have been a tad critical of the Easy Bay boys, but god-damn! This album totally took me by surprise. I sincerely expected a continuation of Life Won't Wait album stylings(which I liked surprisingly), but no way! It's back to basics and thank Jesus! Buy it!"
2,A big disappointment from a great band,"I've been a Rancid fan since the first self-titled album, and this is easily their worst album. I don't mind that they went for a hardcore sound on this record rather than the ska and reggae sounds that were found on their two previous albums. My problem is that these aren't hardcore songs done well. There is no build-up, contrast, or surprises in most of the songwriting that would warrant the monotonous angry tone. For songs so loud and fast, they simply don't rock as hard as they should. I love good hardcore music, and I love Rancid, but aside from a few classic tunes like Radio Havana, I don't regularly play anything on this disc. Their other albums are just so much better."
2,A Step Back,"Rancid always wanted to be the Clash, but this time Tim Armstrong and Co. should have taken a closer listen to the Clash's ""White Riot."" Rancid is definitly not moving forward with this release. Sure, it's fast and hard, but there is nothing on this album that's nearly as fleshed out as anything on ""And Out Come the Wolves"" and ""Life Won't Wait,"" and there's nothing as intense as earlier Rancid tracks like ""Radio Radio."" This is the sound of a band that's trying to atone for the lackluster sales of ""Life Won't Wait,"" which is unquestionably the band's best release. It displayed a lyrical maturity, inventive punk rock melodies and a nice updating of the Clash's reggae/rock sound. This, however, is punk tried and true. We've been here already, and so has Rancid. It's a shame for a band that displayed so much growth on its last release to retreat to its old sound."
3,faster isn't always better,"90% of the bands in the world would be proud to put out an album this good -- but, unfortunately, By Rancid standards its fairly mediocre stuff. The energy level is high, but many of the songs sound sloppy and unfinished. (imagine their debut record with more yelling and less melody) ""Radio Havana"" and ""Let Me Go"" are by far the strongest songs here. (""Havana"" sounds like a leftover from the last record) The rest of the album is pretty hit-or-miss. Some songs like ""Poison"" and ""Its Alright"" stand out, but many others just sorta blur together. There are already a few songs I routinely skip over -- I've never done that with a Rancid CD before."
3,a little too hectic,"Ok, so i'm not a die-hard rancid fan. I don' have all of their CD's, this is only my third one, but my initial reaction to this one is that it's harsher than their previous efforts. Not nearly as ska influenced as ""out come the wolves"" or ""let's go"". If you're a fan of punk style aggression, then you will probably like this album. Very few of the songs are over a minute and a half and they're very viscious assaults on your ears. The vocals are more shouting than singing or that laid back rancid-style sing talking and the songs all kind of sound the same because of it. Perhaps this is an album that just takes some more getting used to than their other stuff, but whatever the case may be, I'm not entirely impressed with this effort."
4,just want to dwell on something...,"It's easy to see where die-hard rancid fans and semi rancid fans split at the seams, and it all happened when this album arrived. Even though I'm not the BIGGEST fan of hardcore punk, the rather brutal (and definitely NON-MTV-ish quality) Rancid 2000 has key tracks that satisfy even if you don't exceed in taste for this genre. Also, I don't see a lot of people mentioning the song Golden Gate Fields too much and it's making me question why. It's probably the most meaningful song on the cd, one of the catchiest, and the way tim's vocals grind through your ears is definitely unbeatable.Key Tracks: Let Me Go, Young Al Capone, GGF, Black Derby Jacket, Radio Havana"
3,GREAT FOR THE PRICE,"I thought this dvd for the price was great. I would not pay much more for it. The owners manual that comes with the camera discribes the features and functions as if you already know about digital SLR's. This video ""dummy's"" it up a bit. It does need to talk more about how to take better pics than how to use computer software. Over all i do recommend this dvd, it's cheap and helpful."
3,Lip Sync!,The lip sync is out on this DVD. With saying that its easier to watch this DVD than to wade through the manual.
5,Fabulous!,I love this dvd it is so incredibly entertaining! Some people may tell you that these videos are dated but I'm here to tell you that as an avid watcher of vh1 classic these videos fare far better than most of those during the eighties! I love watching the outfits. My favorites are the blouses with the fox and dog. Hilarious! As for the hairstlyles poor Frida could not get a break(thank god for frizz-ease).
5,BONUS ARE GREAT,I'D DO IT AGAIN.LIKE TO KNOW WHO SINGS THIS SONG? SHE'LL BE CRYING OVER YOU. IS A GOOD SONG.WOULDN'T YOU LIKE IT?1972 VERSION IS GREAT.DON'T KNOW WHO SINGS IT? HOPE THE BAY CITY ROLLERS CAN GET THE NEW CD OF ALL NEW SONGS THEY RECORDED IN 2001. RELEASE.JUST LIKE THEY DID WITH ROLLERWORLD LIVE AT THE BUDOKAN
2,"Remove Lees' Review, Add Pane's","It is not appropriate for an author of a book to put in a review, and that is exactly what the 1 review is.Frances Pane sent in a review 3 weeks ago which was ignored. Why?"
4,As expected.,The leotard is exactly as pictured. My daughter loves to wear it around the house and the color is perfect for our needs.
1,This Book [Stinks],"Every idea this guy has for trading does not work. Moreover, the book is supposed to be about trading stocks and options, as well as futures, but the whole book is about futures.He basically says that markets trade in two identical cycles in both the morning and afternoon. So the market is supposed to go up or down in two stages in every morning and afternoon. You wait to see what the first stage is, then enter to catch the second one, which will either last as long as the first or will rise or fall as much as the first. It doesn't work.The book is just a complete waste of time."
5,"An Profound Call to Radical, Countercultural Christianity.","These authors cut straight through the lighter, more popular, aspects of society and dive straight into a radical life of Christ-baised community that challenges evil face to face, without returning evil for evil. If this book were to be widely accepted it could turn our society upside down. If you read it carefully, it might just turn your own world upside down (or more accurately right side up). I first read this book 5 years ago and still, today, I feel a flood of emotions go through me, whenever I pick it up."
2,Works for me.,"Out of the box it seems like its alright but when you take it out and pull out the hose there is some tyoe of chemical coating that comes off. I don't know if its a protective coating of the product or what. If only I had known that this would be the kind of product I'm getting I would have gone to the local hardware store that starts with an ""L"" and ends with a ""S"" and bought their product and I would have gotten my discount too. Next time I would think about twice about getting this type of products. Shipping cost is on the high side too.If anyone is thinking about buying this product , think twice and check your local hardware store.It might even be a better product."
3,reel works great but hose cracks over time,"The reel part works great, but the hose started to form cracks and leaks over a years time. I use it in my automotive shop here, So it gets a lot of use. It usually keeps leaking near the coupler end where you hook up the air tool. I been cutting out the end of the hose where it leaks and reclamping the coupler back on."
2,OK tool but cheap hose,Hose cracked and blew out after 7 months of mostly weekend use. Ratcheting reel mechanism works OK. Expect to have to buy a better hose before too long.
3,Does Not Hold Legal Size Pages,"This is a decent typing stand/copy holder. I like the fact that it fits many pages on the stand at one time, however, there is no way to stand up straight pages that are longer than 11 inches. So if you are typing from legal size pages (14 inches long) it's almost impossible to get them to stand up straight while you type.Other than this complaint, this is a sturdy, strong, convenient and long lasting typing stand/copy holder."
3,A mixed bag,"On Every Street was the album that I waited for for a long long time, and when it came out, I listened a few times and then put it away in favor of Communique and Brothers in Arms. I have taken it back out since, and appreciated it for what it was, but it's just a little too heavyhanded with the social commentary, and a little too light with the smoking tunes.As many others have said here, there are some real gems. Knopfler's stellar guitar work is what makes the album even worth mentioning, and songs like How Long, Planet of NO and Calling Elvis certainly stick with you for a while, but there's just too much filler in between, and the Dire Straits fan is not used to filler. And being the rather bombastic and preachy filler that it is, it's not even easily ignored. At the end of the day, On Every Street is just too much work to listen to much."
2,Disappointing ending to a great band,"I remember the anticipation waiting for this CD's release.The first song Calling Elvis is one boring song.He almost sounds uninterested singing it.Far from the real emotion in is voice in such songs as Telegraph Road.The song drags on, and im afraid i never realy liked it.The best song on this album is Heavy Fuel.That song seems to sound like the Dire Straits of old.Some of the songs are alright,but i think the disappointing thing is,it just didnt seem his usual perfectionist style.If you are a Straits fan you should have this CD, and i think you would realise that they had come to the end of the road.There doesnt seem to be any spark.The anticipation for this album was huge,after all they had that massive tour in 1985/86.I went to 2 concerts when they came here in Melbourne in 1991 for the tour for this CD.And i must say they were very good.But its not a CD(Unlike other Straits CD's) you can look back upon fondly,and relive the magic."
5,Sounds like a broken record...,"Why? Because it's simply another facinating, diverse album. Knopfler may have not made any money with this album but it's excellent and I listen to it all the time.You won't find a better song than ""You and Your Friend"" a very dark, sexual song, fueled my Mark's grainy voice, his exceptional work with the Dobro and his nasty guitar. You can hear every Knopfler breath and the slide and guitar are seperated stereophonically (I suggest to represent his 2 friends). It's a symphony of sex and if you listen closely...man, that's some masterful writing!This album is loaded with ironical pieces - but as someone already pointed out, this is the crossover album for Mark's excellent solo album. I don't expect he'll ever make another one, but who knows. This is fascinating stuff."
1,did'nt recive the right cd I got a diff cd,I didnt recive the right cd I got a cd by inya i didnt sent it back that would have not been worth it because it came from germany i still would like the cd i ordered Robert Smith
1,Heavy fuel sucks!!!!this album deserves no stars,"One of every street is the worst dire straits album.Heavy fuel is a awful joke of a song.The good album s from Dire straits are their DEBUT,BROTHERS IN ARMS and LOVE OVER GOLD albums.Avoid this and got those albums instead."
3,A last gasp from a great band,"I own ever Dire Straits album and unfortunately have to say that the last is also certainly the least. The massive success of 1986's ""Brothers in Arms"" album seems to have exhausted leader Mark Knopfler and the band right along with him. A few songs like ""Calling Elvis"" and ""Heavy Fuel"" resonate, but little among the rest carry the weight of any song on their classic albums. Give Knopfler credit for knowing when it was time to pack it in instead of keeping the band together solely for the money."
5,crossing over mandolin style,This is one cd worth listening to!! Great christian music!! Could have used a mandolin in at least one of the songs.
5,aBSULUTELY AMAZING,THIS CD IS VERY AMAZING AND AND DEEP ITS JUST AWESOME.IF YOURE THINKING ABOUT BUYING THIS CD GET TO AND DO IT! YOU WONT BE SORRY.ITS GOT HARD SONGS AND SLOWER SONGS AND THEY ARENT ALL ABOUT BREAKUPS AND SKATEBOARDING LIKE ALOT OF BANDS THESE DAY IT IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST.THIS CD WILL BE A GOOD USE OF YOURE MONEY!!!!
5,This cd rocks!,"After listening to No Name Face, I was worried that this cd wouldn't quite measure up. But I was really surprised. Stanley Climbfall is one of the best cd's I've ever heard. Jason Wade is one of the best songwriters out there. Lifehouse puts more emotion into one song than most artists put into their entire career. I just hope everyone hears this cd and realizes how brilliant these guys are."
1,Am i listening to the same cd?,"After an adequate if a little bland debut album, i expected and anticipated great things from Lifehouse. Although second albums are known to be difficult, i beleived the band to have promise. How wrong was I.There is not a single song on here that lives up to the standard of any of those on 'No Name Face'. Its all highly irritating, mediocre and thoughroughly tuneless. I have a very varied taste in music and I do know a melody when it comes my way, but there is no melody on this album worth writing about.I write this to stop others making the same mistake I did, and if you like Lifehouse because of 'No Name Face', trust me stay away from this so you still have some love for the band.Switchfoot, Vertical Horizon, Jimmy Eat World even the Calling(whose album I also think suffers from having only one good song on it but is still better than this drivel) are in a class of their own when compared to Lifehouse im afraid. Spend your money and time elsewhere."
5,LIFEHOUSE/ ABAND THAT CAN HIT EVERY EMOTION,THIS BAND HAS TO BE THE MOST MUSICALY INCLINED EVER. THEY TAKE MUSIC TO THE NEXT LEVEL. BOTH CD ARE THE BEST YOU COULD EVER BUY. IF YOU A TRUE MUSIC FAN YOU'LL LOVE THIS CD FROM A HEAD BANGER TO BOY BANDS U'LL STOP AND LISTEN TO THIS BEATIFUL MIX OF MUSIC. I RECOMEND THIS CD OVER ANY OTHER CD IN THE WORLD!
4,Security+ SYO-101,"This is a very good book for the Security+ SY0-101 exam. Having just passed the exam i can recommend this book to anyone looking for an in depth study with explanation of each of the five Comptia Security+ domains. The book is written very well, although there are grammatical errors throughout. I used to book in conjunction with the exam cram book and multiple practice tests and passed with flying colors."
3,Good book but contains errors,This is a pretty decent book but contains some technical errors so be carefull!!
1,I hated this album,best cut was raw 91 the rest of it [stinks] features a very young jay z way b4 he got on roc a fella for those who wanna know a little rap history.
4,EE ticket,"It really good, considering thats it's mainly just two gifted musicians in a living room:)"
1,The only thing good about it is the price,"This is my fourth inkjet printer (2 HPs, a Canon and now this Epson)...and the worst I've had. Here are the things that are wrong:Paper loads in the back and is difficult to get loaded quickly and easily...so if you run out of paper during a print job it's a real pain.Goes through ink very quickly. Cartridges are $$If one of the color inks (the unit has FOUR ink cartridges) runs out, you can't print at all...not even just in black and white.Does a poor job printing in color...rarely reproduces colors correctly, even after calibration.I'm going back to an HP."
1,epson stylus c66 garbage product,"this should be rated negative (-) 5 stars, this is a garbage product.stopped working , used less than 20 times.don't buy this.garbage product"
3,good value for the printer compromised by cost of cartridges,"when i first purchased this and started using it i thought i got a great deal on a very reliable color printer. then after not all that many printings (it's only applied for light residential use), i realized that epson's strategy was to lure you in with the price of the printer so they could make money by selling you the ink cartridges. they wear out fast and they cost almost 1/2 the price of the printer per cartridge. if i had to do it again i'd probably do more research on cartride cost and life to make cost comparisons."
1,No Show,"I order the printer, paid for it. The item supposedly shipped but it never arrived at my house. I cancelled my order and hopefully you will return my money as promised."
1,Does not work on modern OS's,"Tried installing and using on Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition. I could not get it to launch. Forget it, does not work."
3,Needed more fact checking,"This book is aimed at the general reader and, as such, is organized in a clear manner. It covers the trail period well and, in what is unique, also covers the efforts to preserve the trail up to the current Oregon-California Trails Association. That said, the book needed to be edited again for factual errors. There are way too many. They range from trivial: Shoshone Falls is north of the Oregon Trail not south; Idaho was not included in the list of present day states made from the Old Oregon Country; to more important: Jim Bridger did not SELL Fort Bridger to the Mormons in 1853; to a real howler: blaming the 1854 Ward massacre in present day southern Idaho on the Yakama Indians, instead of the Shoshones (and by the way there were two survivors). It's too bad. This could have been a good general history for the non-specialist with a little more care. As it is it is OK as an overview, but be careful with the details."
5,Carhartt shirts,It's to hard to tell the difference between XXL and XXL-reg. when you are making the order. And since you charge to send things back would be nice if this was clearer.
4,Great Quality/Runs Big,"I ordered a few of these shirts for my husband. I ordered a large based off his other pocket tees by other brands (Hanes, etc) but it was too big. There was a 3 inch difference in width and about the same in length. Once I exchanged them for a Medium we were both very happy with the quality!"
4,Good Looking T-Shirt,This T-Shirt is well made and it looks good. The price was very nice at the time of purchase. Definitely 4 Stars!
5,The Best Shirt,"These Carhart shirts aren't as thick as they used to be,but they are still thicker than most t-shirts out there. would buy again"
2,moments of t-shirt awkwardness,"The fit on these t-shirts are ludicrous. I ordered a small and what I received would be considered a large had I ordered it from Gap or Land's End. While I am by no means tiny, Carhartt's version of the venerable t-shirt is only a couple notches shy of a gown on my frame. You gotta be a big corn-fed American boy to sport one of these.Running it through the dryer made it worse; the neck hole shrank but the other dimensions remained almost unchanged. Even the pocket sits forlornly off to the side, as if seeking the shelter of my armpit. This is possibly the most awkward t-shirt I've ever bought."
3,"good material, bad fit",Shirts are made of the typical carhartt quality I was used to but the fit is not good. Out of the box the size large was basically a dress and I'm a borderline XL as it is. One wash and now it suffers from the infamous as long as it is wide epidemic. Shrunk up very short but stayed large in width. I bought several other colors but this is the only one I've worn since washing so cant comment on those as of yet. Unfortunately the search continues for quality material with a good fit.
5,Best saw blade ever!!,I have a very old Sears table saw and this blade is just for it. Finest cutting blade I have ever owned. It even says on the package that this blade is for the older (less HP saws.I can only image how this blade will work on a newer table saw. BUY THIS BLADE you won't be sorry.
5,Worth the money,"While Freud blades are expensive, the quality of the steel and the precision of their set make the extra cost worth it. Since cost is always an issue, I try and buy things I know I will use some time, when they are on sale. This is a good all purpose blade that rips well at full table saw depth, leaving sharp cut margins with virtually no splintering."
2,Vibrates bad,"Well I must go against the grasin on this one.Ive used prob 75 differant blaeds in my caqrrier on differant saws, this one was a big dissapointment. It vibrates so bad my saw was moving on the stand, no its not bent, it also is very loud. Swithced to the Freud 1050 10"" combination for ripping on my table saw and it is smooth and quite, cuts smooth and easy, I recomend this one"
2,Very unimpressed,"Wow...I saw all the good reviews and was expecting an amazing blade...boy was I wrong. The thing did cut quickly and easily but when I looked at the edge of the board it was TERRIBLE! I would have to joint the board 1/16"" to get rid of all the marks it left.I am sure that my table saw is adjusted properly cause I just checked it with a dial indicator. I also look at the results I get from my Ridgid combination blade, which are like glass. The Freud is almost like what you get from a bandsaw blade but with burn marks to boot!Maybe this blade needs a stabilizer to work properly, but I'm not going to buy one to find out if I can return this."
1,More unoriginal tripe,Unoriginal agenda driven tripe.Tedious. Don't waste your time with this nonsense. I'll summarize it: Guns are way too dangerous.........they should be illegal. Everything else is filler.
4,Great Stuff,The standout song on this album for me was A song for You which I think is a classic.Still crazy after all these years is a good song. Regina Belle does way better with If I Could but all in all this is not a bad set of songs.
2,Rather Uninspirational,"Reading the reviews, I was hyped to finally receive this CD. On the first listen I was not impressed. Second and third also. It is fine as background music, but for something to relax to or get into more reflective state of mind it did not deliver. Given the price tag, this CD is way overrated."
2,"Repetitive, pale, disappointing","Ugh. I've read a lot of Margaret Atwood over the years and have a great deal of respect for her, but this one is almost unreadable. My feeling is that it's essentially the same story disguised and retold until you're sick of it. And it's not even a very interesting story: the main character experiences a vague, late-middle-aged regret for grand ambitions unfulfilled, coupled with either diffuse guilt for having, in youth, failed a friend, or an unfocused resignation over having been misused at some point in life, generally romantically. I had to give it a score slightly higher than the lowest, only because it's Margaret Atwood and even at her worst she's far better than hacks like Dan Brown."
1,Hopelessness is depressing.,"In ""Wilderness Tips"" there is no redeeming value in any of the relationships in any of the stories. You would expect at least one of the stories to contain some hope for the future...but in all of the stories there is an underlying sense of hopelessness and despair. Any of the characters that have a sense of self are broken by the end of the story. What is the point?"
2,"It's ok...hard to put together, pieces easily lost","I bought this on sale for my 3 year old, and he can't put it back together unassisted. Even I had trouble with it at first, the printed outlines for the pieces could be bolder and there could even be raised guiding outlines to make it easier for younger children, but there aren't.When you pick it up, you have to balance it so the pieces don't fall off, they don't interlock very well.We've had this a few months and as of right now, at least 3 of the pieces are missing. If you have one child and have the time to re-assemble and organize puzzle pieces on a nightly basis, go for it and purchase this. If not, don't bother, there are better puzzles out there."
4,The Snowy Day,"This book is a very well written childrens book. It is about a little boy who goes outside and plays in the snow all day. He puts snow in his pocket before he goes inside and after his bath he checks for it and notices it is gone. He is sad, he dreams that the snow melted. When he wakes up the snow is all there and he goes and plays with his friend.I thought this book was a very easy reader. Childrenof all ages 3 to 6 would enjoy this book. So the next time you read a story to help you get your child to sleep remember about, ""The Snowy Day."" Written by Ezra Jack Keats."
3,It's a Blizzard Inside,"Ezra Jack Keats does as outstanding job with his use of sight and sound words although the art work he used in this book is horrible!! I think first graders could have did a better job than that. Maybe next time the author should find a new artist. The story is something the children will enjoy, but without good pictures the children do not always stay interested. After reading many childrens' books this is definitely not one for entertainment. I would recommend this book for the use of learning details only. I know this would not have been my first choice when I was a child."
3,Adventures In the Snow,"What a wonderful day it would be, spending it playing in the snow! Reading this story made me reminiscence about my own snow days when I lived in Washington. I enjoyed looking at the pictures and seeing many different textures: a crisp white for the snow on the trees, a pattern of brown and black for the tree bark, wisps of white swirls for clouds, and a water color white and blue for the snow on the ground which gave it an authentic feel. Overall, this book was an easy read and the pictures complemented the text well. When I read this book to my preschoolers, they did not focus on the text as much but were more fascinated by the pictures. On student said, ""I like the picture of the big piles of snow."" Another happily said, ""The snowball fight was the best!"" I would think this book would work best in a first grade or second grade classroom. The language is the book would be easy for them to understand, but more difficult for a child who is just learning to read."
4,The Snowy Day,"This book is a very well written childerns book.It is about a little boy who goes outside and plays in the snow all day. He puts snow in his pocket before he goes inside and after his bath he checks for it and notices it gone. He is sad he dreams that the snow melts. When he wakes up the snow is all there and he goes and plays with his friend.I thought this book was a very easy reader. childern of all ages 3 to 6 would enjoy this book. So the next tiome you read a story to help get your child to sleep remember about the,""Snowy Day."" Written by Ezra Jack Keats."
3,Good classic made bad by a bug,This all time classic would be tons of fun to play were it not for a bug that prevents signaling of which direction to go in even though that option is turned on.
3,This is great - seems most issues are down to the player...,"Well i just got this from Netflix and ran it on my Media PC with PowerDVD 7.3 Ultra.There were absolutely no pauses in a scene.There were some small ones before / after death scene.Quality is outstanding.Yes running this on a PC you still get an infinite lives issues (even if you set to 5) and the menu screen background turn black.Gues this is what happens when a beta product (blu-ray) wins over a finsihed product (HD-DVD) - i assume DL will release a bug fixed version eventually.However i had a great few hours playing this - i have bought many other versions and got bored / not go past opening few scenes. With this i played it all the way trhough. Great fun, great experience, shallow gameplay by modern standards but fun!Can't wait for space ace to appear in my next netflix shipment :-)"
3,Don't trade your old one in just yet...,"Just a heads up on this, I'm having the exact same issue that the PS3 owners are having with my brand new Panasonic blue ray player. If your main reason for buying this on blue ray is to play it, I'd be very care full, playing it on a regular player doesn't necessarily eliminate the problem the PS3 owners are having. I've tweeked it every which way in the set up menu and I still fall short of being able to actually play it. But if all you want to do is watch it or check out the features for the memories, your going to be very happy with this, it looks and sounds amazing!Oh and just to let you know, the features on the old DVD like all the old arcade footage from the 80's is not on the blue ray. Overall I'm very dissapointed."
3,Shipping too costly,"I got this for my daughter and the price was good but the shipping way too high. Be careful when you order this, because Amazon shows the 1 gallon size with a pump next to it for a combined price. Read the deal. The pump is for a 32 oz. bottle NOT for the 1 gallon jug."
2,Hibiclens,"I have used Hibiclens four years or more and this is the first time I have been disappointed. The cap was cracked and taped together, there was no seal and the solution is foamy like soap. I have never had this solution with foam to it, it doesn't have a lather to the solution normally. It is a bit frightening. I will buy again but not from this seller."
2,Okay for casual training.,"I have owned Michelins in the past, and was never quite satisfied with them. They seem to wear very quickly. In my case, less than 1500 miles. These Speedium 2s are even worse. I have less than 1000 miles on these, and they are already paper thin. When I first put them on..., my bike handled quite a bit differently. Diving into turns, I did not seem so confident with these. The bike felt as it it were drifting. On my first ride, I remember getting off my bike three times to check if I had a flat. These tires are just plain weird."
3,Color mismatch: grey is not like in the pictures,"Michelin produces pictures that are not real at all.. i bought the grey tires but they arent grey like in the picture but they are almost black..it's a charcoal grey ,a very deep grey...they should update the picues!!!!!!"
4,Great CD included with book,I recieved this as a gift and didn't know what to expect. The CD in the book is my favorite part. It immediately became a part of our bedtime routine. The songs all feature men (boys) from the Bible so it is perfect for my son. It wouldn't have been as appropriate for a girl baby. The book itself has beatiful illustrations but isn't something we read often. It was a lovely gift though if for nothing else than the CD.
