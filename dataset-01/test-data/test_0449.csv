3,FINE TUNING ASSERTION TRAINING,Excellent manual for those who are capable of improving social contact skills on their own and those fortunate to be trained by the authors.
1,More Bias...More Rhetoric...,This book is full of bias right-wing fundamentalist rhetoric. Anyone who knows anything about the Bible and the history of America will easily see right through the smoke screen presented in this book. If you have not a concern for truth of Christianity and our country...this book is for you.
5,Will the real revisionist please stand up?,"This book has 55 pages of footnotes that reference original documents referred to in this book. The book only has 533 pages which means over ten percent of it is footnotes.The people who accuse this book of revisionist history have clearly never checked out any of the original documents. And do not supply more than one or two footnotes.I haven't checked them all out myself but I have checked out many, and I trust the man who refers to the original material more than I trust people who think name calling is a valid argument. This book is for real, the negative reviewers are just blowing bias a smokescreen in your faces."
4,Nice unit,"downloaded drivers from Lacie site, installed unit flawlessly on an ibook running 10.3.9both toast and lightscribe nice and easy and a pleasure to use."
4,"Great album, mediocre recording","If you already love Tommy and have the original recording by the Who, you should listen to this as well for the sake of comparison. If you've never heard any version before, you should listen to the Who's recording instead. This Broadway recording has some lyric and song changes from the original. It has a new song (I believe my own eyes) which is pretty good but standard Broadway material; the songs that were left out (like Sparks & the Underture) were stronger musically. There are many other smaller changes. I found this album to be kind of vanilla. It lacked intensity and leaned more toward standard musical than rock opera."
5,A Great Collection of Turkish Pop,"Just buy it and listen to Sezen Aksu. She is the queen of world-music but no one know that for now. Buy it, listen to her and be one of the lucky persons which know that."
1,Blank screen...just what I wanted.,"Talk about frustrating. I followed the instructions exactly, waited, stared, waited, stared, waited..watched the little hour glass blink blink blink...then....nothing. The screen went blank. I waited for quite a while. No picture ever showed up. So I looked in the instructions, and it said to call the manufacturer. The manufacturer who was, of course, closed. Luckily I was able to look up information from other reviews like these and see that the battery went dead. An incredible waste of time, money, and pee. Use something else."
4,Great for not having to interpret results!,"I bought this test simply because I was in a rush to buy something and get out of the store without being seen. (I hadn't told anyone we were trying) I didn't hold the stick midstream since I was so nervous I was afraid that I would drop it in the toilet, so I used the pee in a cup and dip it in method. The results are unmistakeable and made for an interesting photo which we used to slip into other pictures to tell my husband's parents.My only complaint is that the digital read out disappears after a certain amount of time....I read that all tests are invalid after 10 minutes, but by the time my husband got home, I only had a blank screen on the stick to show him.Either way....it was accurate for me!"
1,Buyers Beware,"I too have tried this twice today at separate times. I am a week late and I have had two see leaflet messages. When looking at the lines that are on the back of the pee stick, there is one definate line and one very very very faint line. I have used these before and that faint line has meant both pregnant once and not pregnant once. I wouldn't waste my money on these. I have found the cheap tests to be more accurate!!"
1,Holder not reliable,"I purchased the EPT Certainty 2 pack and followed the instructions and inserted the stick into the holder and got the ""see leaflet"" message on the holder display. According to the instructions in the packet, this means an error occurred with the holder and I had to wait 30 minutes for the message to disappear to try again. In about 10 minutes, the screen went blank. I waited for over 30 minutes and inserted a new stick and received another ""see leaflet"" message. The screen went blank shortly thereafter. After speaking with customer service, I was told that either the holder was defective or the battery was dead. After paying close to $20.00 for this product, I must say I am very disappointed. I since went and bought a non-digital test (First Response) and it worked just fine and cost a lot less!"
3,not exhilirating,"I had a co worker that had peppermint oil that was potent enough that when you inhale it, it would give you an energy boost. This is not that type of oil. The product probably does what it is intended for, but I wish it could do it all."
2,Got the wrong product,"I ordered peppermint oil because I was told that spraying a diluted amount around your house would make ants avoid it. (I have like four different kinds living around my house I need to take care of) When I received the oil it turned out to be rosemary oil. I was told that it also could work but I ordered the peppermint because I prefer the scent. I was going crazy with constantly finding ants in my house though so I just tried it. It seems to be working fine, and it did arrive on time. However they just got lucky sending me the rosemary that also works for what I wanted it for, otherwise they would have one star for timely delivery (which still isn't as fast as some others I have had things shipped from)."
5,Great info and a fun read,"My 7 year old son loves the idea of being a survival expert. Most of his ""survival"" involves spending the afternoon in the year eating sandwiches in his tent. I purchased the ""SAS Survival Handbook"" as a something fun to read with him.We both love the book! It's packed with info that is both handy to know and fun for kids to learn."
5,Useful survival guide for everyone,"For most people living in urban area, you may not have any chance to practice the survival skills described in this guide. However, the knowledge (e.g. how to prepare your trip, how to look for water/food in the wild, how to find shelter) may save your live in adverse situation.Thus, I recommend this book to everyone, especially frequent travellers."
1,Be careful... Different Book,This is not the same that I got. The book was from different publisher and I took long time to come to me
3,I like to read,This book arrived on time and in great condition. I have always wondered what Tocqueville was about so I purchased his work on Democracy in America. Tocqueville posited many possibilities as to the outcomes of our country's democracy some of them have come true.
4,Balanced and Fair,"No matter what your view is on this subject, you will enjoy seeing this issue from all sides. Each of the four commonly held views of women in ministry are represented, from very conservative to very egalitarian. The facts are laid out for each view, and then other scholars react and respond to each view. It works and is easy reading. This book provides valuable insight on this topic and is worth reading. BJV Dworak"
3,What a disappointment - hire it don't buy it,"I actually bought this dvd because others recommended it obviously some people tastes need improvement - has some decent actors Denzel Washington, Val Kilmer both have the experience to have included a better ending - the film follows the investigation of a river boat blowing up near New Orleans with the FBI having this new equipment that can see four days into the past which is used to track the perpetrators, the story line is actually good even after Denzel Washington realizes that he can travel back in time to save one of the victims its not until the ending when they try to stop the bomb blowing the ship that the plot goes right down the drain"
3,Hard to believe but good film.,"Deja Vu starring Denzel Washington is an effective film even though this plot could never happen in real life. The supporting cast makes this film worth watching, James Caviezel and Val Kilmer are excellent in their very different roles. This film deals with the effects of time travel, this aint no Back to the Future but this film is grossly engaging."
3,Since when did voyeurism become a virtue?,The premise of this movie is an interesting one. Denzel Washington is an ATF agent who while investigating a ferry explosion is recruited by a group of government funded techno nerds who have a device which can see backwards in time.Somehow their mission mostly involves observing the leading actress in the shower and also walking around her apt in her underwear. Denzel is suddenly smitten and decides he has to go back in time to save not 300 victims in a ferry explosion but one woman he has seen in her underwear. This is Hollywood at its most insipid and this would have been a pretty decent movie if it wasn't for this adolescent spin.
4,Interesting,"The movie kept me interested as well as confused. I'm not a fan of time travel stuff, but Denzel pulled it off. Denzel goes back in time to save a young woman's life and to stop a ferry from being blown up by a terrorist. I love the way little details came together after Denzel traveled backwards (bloody rags at Claire's apartment, the ambulance in the burned out structure, etc).Unfortunately Val Kilmer added nothing to this movie.Even though the end results were predictable I still enjoyed the film. Everything worked for me except the final, sappy-sweet ending. How did Denzel pull that off? Who saved him? It confused me further, but I still liked the movie.This is one of those movies that I didn't know existed until I ran across it at the video rental store. It's been out for years and it's certainly worth the rental price."
2,Confused and Trite,"I like Denzel a lot, but I wish he would recognize a poor script and pass it by. This movie starts with a great opening scene and then steadily descends into a confused tangle of hopeless science fiction and comical references to the ""Einstein-Rosen Bridge."" Overly melodramatic and entirely predictable, the story is saved by the always convincing work of Jim Caviezel as the villian. On the other hand, Washington's acting is unfortunately stereotypical. He really needs to get a new persona - it's no fun to see him adopt the same sly, intense, smirking image that we have seen so many times. Maybe Clint could do it and we loved it, but DW? I don't think so. Ultimately this flick succumbs to its convoluted plot and instead of a gripping movie full of surprises we get a dismal bit of sci-fi confusion."
2,CHEESE!!!,"Who would ever believe that there's technology out there that can look back in time 4 days, then add to that, you can hear the person too?? Then later get into a machine and travel back???The love story didn't work for me either.I was very disappointed in this movie. The only reason I gave it two stars is because...it's Denzel and James Caviezel!"
5,One of my favorites movies,"Maybe it's just the romantic geek in me, but I love this movie! Time travel, worm holes, space time continuum all wrapped up in a dramatic thriller!"
4,A NEAT SCI-FI THRILLER FOR THE NEW AGE!,"This movie got my attention right away and kept it! It's face paced and has a very interesting story. There are some problems in the story line,but not too much to keep you from enjoying this intense and intriging thriller."
5,Very good--lots of twists and turns,Really enjoyed this movie. Lots of twists and turns; kept you focused every step of the way. Would highly recommend
5,Wonderful movie,"I really enjoyed this thriller, it is always exciting when a movie is written that can take you through it with all of the grace of the great classics, without using all the very unintelligent swearing. Really shows that the people behind the movie, are leaps ahead of those that feel they have to follow along like a herd of sheep and swear needlessly to make a point. These that made this film are of a higher line of thinking. Thank you so much, well done, and enormously enjoyed!!"
4,effective,"I have used this emulsion remover with both TZ photo emulsion and Speedball emulsion. It works great. One reviewer said it takes 1/2 a bottle for a large screen. Not sure what this person is talking about. I use 20x 24 inch screens. You just paint a little on with a brush and wait about 1 minute, then rinse with water. It's saved many of my screens."
5,Fantastic!! You must buy,"This book is full of clear information and common sense. Not just people with back issues, but all people, should read this book. Your back is connected to the whole body. Learn how to keep your back healthy and buy this book!"
4,An incredible yet little known true story,"This account of the first south-north crossing in Victorian times is incredible. A film of this story several years ago did little to change that situation. The story recounts the key attempts and the elaborate expeditions involved. The crux of the story really revolves around a series of many mishaps and oh so near misses. Tragedy was almost avoided numerous times but ultimately...well read the book. The fact that the story is known and accurately recorded is in itself an incredible sub-plot. It is hard to believe sometimes that this is a true story -- yet this is a case of real life being more amazing than one would dare write as fiction! The story is quite detailed but hang in there, the threads all come together in an incredible finale."
2,Save Your Money,Video and sound quality is substandard. I would recommend that you save your money for a different MJ purchase. OK
4,You love Lloyd Weber plays you will love this book.,You will love this book if you love the stories Andrew Lloyd Weber uses for his musicals. It was so touching and tragic it made me cry! Plus if you never got to see the play this book is great because if follows the play so closely.
1,Poor Service,I ordered the Sudoku Game on 11-14-06. As of today (01-09-07) I still haven't received it. They sent the game somewhere else by mistake. I was emailed stating I would receive it on December 21! I called the supplier on 01-02-07 and was told he would get back with me. I haven't heard a word. I think I've been cheated. I paid for the game back in November. I won't order anymore from this supplier.
4,It helped me,"I dont know the information it has is basic or advanced (because I'm not a sales guy) but I do know that it helped me a lot. I like the style of the book. Very very direct. Not like other books where author write the whole chapter for explaining one concept, beating the bushes. But it contains a lot of tips with enough explaination. I really like this book and will definitely recommend others. Again, I'm not a sales guy but starting my own business."
5,Better Than Halo Sleepsack,"We've tried Sleepsacks (cotton, velboa and fleece) and Lullabags. We're now on our 2nd child and we definitely favor the LullaBag. Don't get me wrong, we think Halo Sleepsacks are great, but here's why we prefer the LullaBag:- the standard LullaBag is slightly heavier than the cotton Halo Sleepsack, but lighter than the velboa and fleece versions. Perfect for putting baby to bed in a room that's 70 - 72 degrees. We put our baby in a long sleeve onesie and then put her in the Lullabag.- the little animals on the LullaBag are adorable!!- for us, the zipper on the LullaBag is easier. But then again, we don't change diapers at night. We use Overnites on our babies so they don't need middle of the night changes."
1,buyer beware,The brackets that came in my kit were for trucks with a six inch fabtech lift. I am now going to have to find or have somebody fabricate brackets that will work. The Item description says nothing of this. Thought it should be known.
4,"If you have questions about ""Christian rock"", get this book.","Kimberly does a great job tracing the roots of ""carnal"" music and for showing how the words of a song is not enough to make it Christian when the beat still leads you into movements of sensuality. If you have questions about ""Christian rock"", this book will help."
1,Terrible product,"I received the ravioli maker for Christmas along with the Kitchenaid mixer and pasta maker. I finally got around to using the ravioli maker yesterday. Unlike the pasta maker which works beautifully, the ravioli maker is terrible. First, it is not electric like the pasta maker. Attaching it to the mixer serves no purpose except to anchor it to something. Each piece of pasta needs to be exactly the correct size as the hopper head. The raviolis turn out very small with little filling. I was able to salvage half of what I made. I froze them so I have not used them yet. I question whether they will open up when boiling.I am very disappointed that Kitchenaid would make this product."
1,Not worth it!,"I'm a big KitchenAid fan, but this attachment is very poorly designed. You have to be able to roll out the dough to the exact width of the ravioli maker for this to work at all. Then the amount of filling you put in needs to be precise. I'd rather make my ravioli by hand. I would get it done ten times quicker and wouldn't have to throw away batches of ravioli that are bursting or not sealing at all. A very frustrating product."
4,Buen video,"Compré este DVD para mi esposa, y a ella la agrado bastante ya que ella pudo aprender un poco más sobre las danzas polinesias. Lo único que ella hubiera deseado es que se agragaran doblajes o subtitulos en español como en algunos otros DVD's de la misma compañía."
1,Horrible!,"If you have liked the series so far, you should spare yourself from utter disappointment. I don't remember the details because I read this several years ago (spent lots of money ordering the whole series from Australia) and couldn't even finish this book.Something seems to have happened to Sara Douglass during her writing of this series. The story line became increasingly more outrageous and grotesque. It appears as though she herself had gone through something terrible in her life and was using this series to get through that nightmare. If she had planned it from the start, then perhaps the story would flow better, but the story line, the tone, and attitude of the series completely switches during the 5th book and never looked back.Sorry I cannot give more details, but if my writing this review several years after I have read the series is any indication, you should save your money and start over with another series."
4,Great read,"Loved this book, a fitting ending to an amazing series. Sara Douglass is a true author with a gift of storytelling. A hightly recommended read for the avid reader. Book arrived in great shape by set date; a very happy customer with a great book."
2,fustrating,"I haven't finished the book yet but found it confusing. The examples are not completed, the reader doesn't have an example of the completed exersize. The author assumes the reader is using apache and tomcat servers. I don't know anyone using them, most developers I know use windows 2000 or NT, running IIS. JDOM is still beta and there's a whole chapter dedecated to JDOM, where it could have been spent on explaining SAX and DOM in further detail by applying useful simple examples. Overall I'm not impressed with the book. Better to read it at the book store and look for something better to purchase. Look for a text that uses IIS and not tomcat and apache, unless you are running those servers. This is not a beginners book, also purchase a JAVA/JSP text."
3,Startling and enlightening at the same time,"I didn't know what to expect from Matthew Stadler, but when my class in literature and sexuality required me to purchase this book, I gladly did so and read it cover to cover. I can't say that it didn't make me uncomfortable, because it very much did. But it also helped me to understand the sickness of love and pedophilia and what happens when you confuse one with the other."
5,Deliciously subversive,"Surrealism has not made it to American literature, let alone to the American popular...""mind"", thus to combine it with pdophilia takes a bit of breathtaking effrontery, especially in this age of evangelical lynch mobs. Said mobs are thus satirised not only IN the novel but as the author imagines them taking ON the novel: subversion both inside and outside the text. A delicious concept, almost as wicked as the Francophilia in Stadler's ALLAN STEIN.Will Oprah make this one of her selections?"
1,price of towels..,I am outraged that someone would try to rip off customers for an item that I can purchase at my local publix for $3.99...
3,Average to below average Elmore Leonard,"The Switch is one of Elmore Leonard's lesser known novels and with good reason. His best work ranks with any of the hard-boiled crime novels ever written. This one is just not up to that level. It is basically a story of two low-lifes who kidnap the wife of a well-to-do shady businessman and hope to get a large sum as ransom. But lots of things go wrong and the novel wanders around. Where it breaks down, I think, is when one of the bad guys isn't bad enough and has the hots for the kidnap victim. She has her own emotional problems including an unfaithful husband. The book ends in an improbable manner. Read it if you must, but start with the best of Leonard if you have not read these books."
2,"Dark, and not cute.","It's dark compared to other adaptations, but that's just fine. Kids should be able to watch dark things.However, this movie..Isn't very good actually. Some may like it, but I find it mediocre. The songs seem out of place, the pace slow and dragged out, and ultimately it's an animated movie gone bad."
1,gold necklace,"The picture of the necklace makes it appear much thicker than it was. I know it says it was 1.3 grams, but I am not a jeweler so I relied on the picture."
1,Noxious FUMES irritated my nose and throat!,"I've regularly used Dow Scrubbing Bubbles on my shower. While it never bothered me too much, I thought that product had strong fumes and probably wasn't safe for my health. So I switched to Seventh Generation Shower Cleaner.How shocked was I when the first time I used it I felt burning in my nose and the back of my throat. I spent the next hour coughing. And no, I DIDN'T inhale any of the mist. This product DEFINITELY has fumes and smells awful. That was a week ago.Hoping it was a fluke (giving the product the benefit of the doubt, I hypothesized that it had released toxic chemicals that had built up in my shower), I tried the product again this evening. SAME result. That was about 45 minutes ago, and I'm still trying to clear the irritation in my nose and throat.As bad as I THOUGHT Dow Scrubbing Bubbles was, that product NEVER had this effect on my health. Seventh Generation Shower Cleaner is definitely NOT recommended."
3,Metal Free.,"This binder has a tendency to roll over at the top or bottom making it less than ideal for wearing over long periods without adjustment. However, it is good to be able to get through TSA airport checkpoints without the metal in some other ones which sets off the detectors."
2,Not Recommended. No installation help at all,"The only instructions are unreadable pict-0-grams on the back of the package. The Pict-O-grams are therefore useless. The blades I bought fit into my vehicle's wiper blade arm in the proper manner but would not snap or lock onto the arm. I've replaced blades many times, and never had any kind of installation difficulty or lack of the blade locking on. The blade appears to work well and cleans the rain off the glass, which is encouraging, but I'll will have to return them if I cannot get them to lock onto the arm. My vehicle is NOT exotic, an 03' Chevy pick-up truck."
2,Small stones/little sparkle,"Ring arrived after three days, does not state caret size. stone very small no light refraction, seems small and dull. design is good, stones unremarkable, reflect very little light"
5,The Center of Winter,It's a great story. I love her writing. Her book Madness about Bi-polar disorder is fantastici too. She very honest & open.
4,"Dark Story, But Beautifully Told","Marya Hornbacher's writing is simply beaufiful to read. This is a rich, emotional piece, cleverly told in several different voices. I had to give it four stars, rather than five, because the rather depressing nature of the story made it difficult for me to get through at first. Still, a very good read, if you can handle it."
4,I am pleased with this headset...,"I really like this headset. The only problem I have with it is that sometimes it gets static while driving when talking to some people (they hear it on their end). Also, the range from the cell phone only makes it about 7-8 feet. The headset is comfortable and easy to use. I would definitely buy another one or suggest buying this headset."
3,"Good, not great...","If you drive a Bentley, Benz, Mazarati or sit in a quiet room and want a Bluetooth this may be for you. If it's windy, your outside mowing or driving a tractor trailer this isn't for you. I have had conversations with people complaining of the background noise and not being able to hear me. This is a problem and an annoyance for them and me. The design is comfortable the features are easy to use and pairing was a breeze. The only problem is reception."
4,Brutal Performance,"Fantastic performance of the orchestra and Osawa. The chorus are excellent but the expression in latin is not so good (""Hozana"" instead ""Hossana""). The tenor Vince Cole had an impressive performance in a Transcendent ""Sanctus"". Bravo! The recording imself are not so good. It needs a excellent sound equippemment because the deep noises."
4,Views from a participant of the recording,"I was in the chorus for this recording, so my opinion on the chorus, which is great, is obviously not objective. I did not like Vincent Cole's singing. His portamento was excessive: approaching every note from a 4th below. From the chorus and through all those rehearsals, concert performances and the ""live"" recording session, it was painful to listen to. That's right, it was not really recorded from one live performance, but put together with more than 100 pieces based on four performances and a ""patch up"" recording session. Thanks to modern recording technology, we don't have to, or don't get to, buy a real live recording anymore."
2,great performance rendered useless,"The performances on these recordings are wonderful. Truly treasures. It's really unfortunate, though, that the transfer is so incredibly poor. Here's the worst part: the mastering engineer is proud of it. There's a disclaimer about the mastering in the liner notes: the original 78-rpm record was transfered to tape then digitized for the CD with all care taken to preserve the quality of the original platter. I appreciate the care in concept but the hiss is infuriating and it really rendered this collection almost unlistenable.Definitely preview this collection before you buy it."
4,butterfly set,"This set was perfect for my 7 year old daughter, she loves pretend play with butterflies. A nice assortment with the names of all the butterflies. I would like it if the labels were not just on the package under the butterflies, but along with a picture as well. As soon as you open it/take out the butterflies, you don't know which one is which (from the names). This would be nice to know for educational purposes."
5,Good Service. Good price.,Bought the product for a Christmas gift. The price was very good and delivery very fast.
1,BEWARE!!!,"I am not sure if this item is good or not...when I ordered it, I did a search for my specific phone and Amazon directed me to the CellStik that matched my search. I ordered it because it said it would work with my phone...when it came in, it was not compatible with my phone. There was no way to tell without opening the package whether or not it would work...therefore, it makes it unable to be returned. A waste of money on my part."
5,Still the best,i think I've read all of Wilbur Smith's books apart from the latest this year and I still think When the Lion feeds is the best. Written from the hearty and not pretentious in any way
5,awesome,I am throughly thrilled with this product. I have enjoyed listening to it over and over. Thank you Amazon
3,Interesting buy not organized very well.,"This makes an interesting reference book on medicinal recipes. I just don't like the way it is organized. You have to thumb through the whole book to get a feel for what ailments it addresses and I found the list somewhat wanting. Other than that, it makes an interesting compendium of Chinese remedies although I think I'll pass on the fried and ground earthworms!"
1,There are better ways to spend your time,"I bought this book because of its 5 star rating. Bad decision. It's just not funny. I'm surprised that some people may laugh at this nonsense. The jokes are not that new. If you watch Jay Leno - you don't need to bother reading this book because it seems like all of the one-liners are right out of the monologue. Maybe they were funny the first time,but for now, I'd skip this book."
4,Great replacement part!,This product was a good replacement for the old faucet in our 1955 Terry Camper. Works great for what it is suppose to do.
2,not super good,this pump pretty much sucks. used it for 3 months in my van and the diaphragm valve inside somehow spun itself around and the pump locked up. i was out in the boonies so i took it apart and eventually found the problem. got the dinky piece of spring which is supposed to hold the valve in place back in position and it worked fine for another 3 months and now it is leaking pretty bad. i wouldn't bother.
2,We were surprised...,"My wife and I were both quite surprised when we received this. It is really, really thin. She is afraid that it would be easily broken if one of the grandkids hooked their fingers in it. It is so thin that it is hard to see the detail that makes it a box chain. It is not easy to judge how jewelry will look from the photo on the computer screen, and will probably stop us from ordering any more over the internet."
4,"The Second of a must own set, but less compelling","Though I would still buy this CD, I like it a good deal less that I like Chopin, volume one. However, there is one thing about this CD which causes me to say you must own it: the finale of Sonata no. 3. Though Kissin performs all of the Sonata well, I find most of Argerich's performance of the Sonata far more fun. However, she fails in the last movement, playing it, as she often does, far too fast. Kissin's finale is positively majestic in it's churning, off-beat rhythm. It is truly wonderful.Many of the Mazurkas played here are played absolutely sublimely. On the other hand, a few of them are less than absolutely wonderful. The last one on the CD, however, is an absolute treasure. I would say this is an essential CD, but, if you are on a limited budget, by Chopin Volume 1 first."
2,Should have stayed hidden underground,This is a terrible live recording. It is cheaply done(sounds like Twenty dollar tape recorder. the playing is Okay but the singing I think is awful. Reading the back we know why it was released but I think it should have stayed on the cutting room floor. StayAway
2,ok for young kids,"Don't buy this unit for a kid who truly knows what makes a ""good"" product. It would be neat for a kid who wants an mp3 just because. Not the best quality. It requires extra work since you have to constantly charge the unit because it doesnt hold a charge very well."
2,Gratuitous self-promotion,"...Ok, I'll grant that Mr. Murtha has had some interesting experiences, some of which even make interesting stories to tell, but underneath it all runs the current of self-promotion. For example, Mr. Murtha runs on and on about the importance of military intelligence, which is true enough, but since he was an intelligence officer, one must take that with a grain of salt. Largely, it's a book of his personal experiences, looked at through his own biases and self-promotion. Take it for what it is -- his story, subjectively told, and not a document of research, objectivity, or analysis.I give it two stars because taking it for what it is, it's nomt horrible, and it is mildly entertaining. But PLEASE, if you feel like you must read it, get it from the library rather than contributing to Mr. Murtha's wallet."
4,Kindle typos,"Although I'm only 40% done with the book, the story itself is quite good. A wonderful historical account of the Cherokee people. However, I am reading the Kindle version, and I find the number of typos and editing mistakes quite distracting. At least 10 have jumped out at me while I was reading."
2,It feels fake,"I just don't see it. The reviews are good and that is why I bought the movie, but it's plastic, not real. It just touches on the surface of the addiction without going deep into the moral retrogression. Is like they had a checklist of things they needed to show and a short time to do it, so they just rush the action. I don't recommend buying it."
4,Amazing story,This is an amazing story and video. The only thing I would caution people on is it does show a person using drugs and can be a trigger for people in recovery.
4,It beats wax,"Why? The simple answer is: water-soluble. Using wax is the best for actual hair removal, but the logistics of handling and cleaning afterwards made it seriously questionable for me. (Tip for wax-users: baby oil will emulsify left-over wax) I was turned on to Nad's when it first appeared in the US roughly 10 years ago. When I ran out recently, I went to Ricky's and decided to try a real wax treatment. Heated wax grips like nothing else, but man are you spending time soaking and cleaning cloths and utensils later--unless you just wanna throw them away (sorry, I wasn't raised like that). Nad's does the job, it just won't always get as much hair on the first try. But when all was said and done, the convenience of Nad's just made wax seem like an awful, lengthy, messy, chore. Nad's, I'm back!"
5,REALLY cute movie,Super cute Christmas movie! I love it sooo much. Its a corny Christmas movie but its the kind of Corny Christmas movie you want to watch.
4,Ten Things I Wish I'd Known Before I Went Out into the Real World,I thought it had practical advice to lead to a happy life. I bought copies for all 6 of my granddaughters.
3,It's ok,"This book is ok, but nothing special. A lot of it was common sense to me. Still, I don't regret the purchase."
1,"Well, so what?","I didn't like it....nice to hear about her life, but I agree with a previous reviewer. WHAT real life? I should have such a real life! She sounds like a very nice woman, who perhaps should stick to TV reporting (or writing tiny self-help books for the supermarket checkout)...I really think her outlook is most applicable to someone in her position...Yuppie Republican women may like it a lot..."
1,Ten things I wish I knew before buying this book,"Ten things I wish I would have known before buying thisbook!...1. That I wasted [my money] 2. That I learned nothing fromit. 3. That the 10 ""things"" could have been discussed in an interview with Barbara Walters and let go at that! 4. There are really 20 ""things"" 5. That the Schrivers were surprisingly a ""Functional"" family for a change. 6. That Maria has her little part time NBC Dateline job only because of her name recognition. 7. That Maria should stay home and take care of the kids, spend Arnold's millions, not feel guilty, and never bother to write another book. 8. That Maria's next book will probably be about divorce if she continues to ""coddle' Arnold. 9. That I won't buy the next book. 10. That....""sorry, Maria, but you aren't pretty. P>S> and that I can't get a refund. END"
4,A way to have it all but there is a price,"Maria Shriver explained to us in her book that a person can have it all but not at one time. Ms. Shriver explains that professional success comes at a price which some people do not want to pay the gatekeeper. There are some people I see in the workplace who utilize deceit as a tool for success and those same individuals usually get what they have coming to them in the end. So the lesson Ms. Shriver had about ethics is one of the most important lessons about achieving success, because without ethics people will not respect you. This particular book is very well written and is something that I would give as a gift to someone who was starting off in their career."
5,Great role model for today's working mom!,"I have always been facinated with all things Kennedy. Like most, I assumed that Maria Shriver rose to her position because of who she was, or what family she was from. WRONG! Maria Shriver shows that in this book that she was raised with a sense of honor and dignity that is rare. I wish that I had a mother like she has, I lost mine when I was too young. This book shows what good parenting can do for a person. This book, while common sense (which is the least common thing!) contained many things that I wish I had known before starting my life's journey. I plan on passing this down to my children. Hopefully, it will instill in them a bit of the grace and style that Maria has! If the networks don't give Maria her own show, on her own terms they are missing out! What a gift she is! Buy this book, it may just make you a better person, I hope it did that for me. I will think twice before doing something that is in the ethicial grey area!"
3,Great lead singer but not enough good material,"Shingai Shoniwa is an amazing vocalist, and the band as a whole has pretty good chops. The sparse instrumentation reminds me a bit of the White Stripes but Shingai Shoniwa sounds like no one else. Her voice has great range and power and she can really drive a song. The CD starts out with 4 pretty good songs, ""Don't Give Up"", ""Scratch Your Name"", ""The Count of Monte Christo"" and ""Sister Rosetta"", but it's all downhill from there. I usually buy complete albums, but I wouldn't recommend buying this one. I think only the four songs I have named are worth getting."
3,Unsnappy duster,"When I first received the duster I was quite pleased. It arrived in a timely manner and in excellent shape. I've wanted one for sometime as I hike and ride a motorcycle. After using it for a few weeks my jubilation is somewhat subdued. While the coat itself appears to be of sturdy material and withstands high winds and cold pretty well, the snaps holding in the fleece liner come unsnapped at the slightest movement. The strap that is used to tighten the left sleeve has the same problem, you bump it, it unsnaps.While these problems don't affect the usability they are quite annoying. As to whether I'd recommend this duster, most likely. I suspect at some point it'll annoy me enough I'll take it in and have the snaps replaced."
4,Could Happen to Anyone (and we wish it would happen more!),"This is a fast-paced read that pulls you into the mystery of ""The Stranger"", and then teases you with just the right amounts of suspicion, sleight-of-hand, sexual tension, love, and puzzling loose ends that are ultimately resolved. I'll look for more titles by Jean DeWitt in the future!"
4,A good resource.,"This book is a good resource for and intermediate to advanced player. I would not, however, recommend it for beginners."
1,"old, poorly edited, bad dancing",I purchased this dvd for my son because he loves to dance and I wanted to surprise him. Shane Sparks is amazing but the little girl that teaches this is not a great dancer by any standards. The music was terrible if you would even call it music. The dance moves were geared to only girls. Overall terrible. I wish I didnt waste my money on this.
4,Love the values it teaches,Sneazle is a good example for kids to learn by. I recommend this for any young child. You won't be sorry.
5,Joydrop rocks,"I first heard ""Sometimes Wanna Die"" on the radio after a particularily horrible night class and I thought ""this is great!"" so the next day I went to the radio station's weblog and found out it was Joydrop. I'd never heard of them before and I had to wait a whole month for the CD (I know, so long) but the wait was worth it. Tara Slone has great vocals with a good amount of edge to her voice, but with songs like ""Embrace Me"" she's absolutely beautiful. Most of the songs deal with some view of human nature, from the sarcastic look at the record companies in ""AmericanDream Girl"" to the life of stars in ""This is not real"". It's a great album to listen to to just kick back with, blast in the car or go jogging with. Go pick it up. It's well worth it."
1,Horrible company service as well.,"I am writing this review on behalf of my mother. She had gotten this oven last year as a christmas gift she picked out for herself after the previous one died (and it was about 5-6 years old).Not even a year later, this oven went Kaput.Calls to Delonghi sales service were apparently quite matter of fact and rude, something akin to ""well, your warranty is expired, so go get it fixed."" Then she found out that getting the model fixed would cost half the price of the model. I do not feel that is conducive to keeping customers happy. She was quite displeased with Delonghi and as such, Delonghi ovens and other products will no longer be entertained as options by at least one suburban housewife/mother that I know of.As for its operation? yeah. it's an oven, it makes toast and it makes pizza and they taste good; but after about a year, it will die."
1,bizarre theories from bizarre academics,"Just take Prof. Heschel, the daughter of a distinguished rabbi and scholar. She finds Gibson's movie anti-feminist. That's a hoot, considering that traditional Judaism was anti-feminist.Some good ideas here, a lot of nonsense by axe-grinding academics. What is clear is that Gibson is 150% a Catholic medieval type. No one here has a good explanation why this appealed to Protestant fundies and bigots who don't give a hoot about the Stations of the Cross or the Virgin Mary."
4,Finally!!!,"Like the previous reviewer, I tried a number of cases before I found one that would work with the 60gb Zen Vision M. This one works as advertised. My only complaint is that the clear plastic screen protector is a little scratched. Other than that, its a great product. Way better than those stupid silicone skins.I also agree with the previous reviewer in criticizing Creative for recommending products that don't work with this device. Hey creative, how about making some accesories for this product. Thanks."
1,Not so Hi-Grade,"Big disappointment! I, too, had problems with scratches caused by this case! So much for protection. The case does not fit the unit, with the synch cutout totally misaligned. Wish I had paid more attention to the reviews before buying."
5,One idiot's review of The Complete Idiot's Guide to iMovie2,"iMovie2 does not come with an instruction book, and the iMac booklet helps precious little, so I was pleased to find Brad Miser's Idiot Guide (which is a series I like anyway). The book is both imformative and insightful, plus a lot of fun to read. It got me going with iMovie in very short order, and when I emailed Mr. Miser to clarify a point, I got a prompt and effective answer. Highly recommended."
4,the best book on the works of the famous architect K. Tange,50 yrs of Architecture and Urban Design. it's the best book concerning the life and the works of Prof. Kenzo Tange.
2,hard book,"The book is not readable and you have to be an expert in the geometric nonlinearcontrol area to follow the book. Before reading the book, you have to masterthe related concepts of differential geometry.The differential geometry summary given in the book is not easy to understand and digest.The book does not have enough examples also.Finally, it just involves geometric control techniques and not others.Hence, its title should be geometric nonlinear control.This book is not a book to learn different nonlinear control techniques in the nonlinear control area."
2,Don't order two from Amazon,"They don't let you specify a frequency. I ordered two and they sent us two which use the same frequency. So my son and I can't fly them at the same time. I called customer service after receiving the order and they said they will send a replacement that uses a different frequency.I have to agree with other reviews, the heli is hard to control and even after adjusting the trim it can fly fine and then spin uncontrollably for no apparent reason. Still, my 8 year old has fun flying it around and it is still pretty fun and we are working on getting the hang of flying it."
1,huge disappointment,"I ordered this for my 7 year old son for Christmas. He has had lots of experience flying the more expensive brands of remote heli's. The Air Hog was totally uncontrollable. My husband worked it for over an hour trying to get it to fly straight and stop spinning... we finally gave up and are sending it back. I had high hopes for it, but am very disappointed."
2,Quit working within a couple weeks,Both my kids received these for gifts. one of them quit working within a week the other the following week. Neither of the kids abused their toys. Terrible value for the price.
1,Hated It!,Hated It! This helicopter was $50. What a mess! It is constructed of some paper plastic mess. One charge for over 1 hour and it can fly for 3 or 4 minutes. What a great waste of money! Steer Clear Of This! I do not understand all of the positive reviews. I just don't get it. This toy was broken Christmas day. The very same day it was opened. Use the thing outside. In the home it hits the walls and breaks.
4,"Fun, what more do you want.","I really don't understand why anybody would be upset with this heli. I understand if it just plain didn't work, but what does everybody expect from this pint-sized chopper. It is not supposed to be a stunt heli with loops and rolls and such. I have had it for less than a day and I want more. I had it hovering and flying in less than 30 minutes. Yes it mostly flies up and down and spins. It is also greatly affected by air movement and yes the battery does run down fast. So what? It doesn't take long to charge up and then fly all over again and again. I have crashed it so many times now I lost count, it still works like new. Yes, I have to do the trim adjustment of the tail every few crashes, so what that takes 5 seconds to do. I was even worried about the IR instead of radio control, there has been no problem. In fact, it was worked so well, I am very, very surprised.To put it simply, this is a fun toy. It is not a model aircraft. It is a flying toy. A great flying toy!"
1,Air Hogs are garbage,"We have purchased 2 Airhogs in the past and they worked for about 2 weeks and just died, would not recharge. Horrible."
1,air hogs,"This is the 2nd time I've bought these for a christmas present in hopes that they were making them stronger. Well, it lasted a week before bitting the dust. These cost way too much for how cheaply they are made. I will never buy another"
4,Play carefully,I can't get my helicopter to charge anymore. It must be french because its fra-geel-a.
5,Great RC Helicopter for the Price,"I bought this for my 9 year old son for his birthday. He loves it. He has been playing with it for over a week now, and it's not broke! It can take a beating and keep on going. I wasn't sure at first when I bought it because I thought it would be another cheap toy and break after an hour of use. I was wrong and I recommend Air Hogs."
1,Doesn't last long!,"We bought this for our son for Christmas and we are very disappointed. It takes forever to get a full charge and then dies within about 5 minutes. It's also very hard to control, if it decides to even go up. Most of the time it just floats about 6 inches off the floor. When it does actually go up in the air it immediately crashes into something and then heads straight for the floor.All in all it's very disappointing. We are returning it tomorrow."
1,"If you have $70 to waste, it's a great toy for the 5 minutes it lasts","Santa brought this Christmas morning. By 1 p.m. one of the helicopters was completely dead. No idea why, but it wouldn't charge and wouldn't rotate. The next day, Wal-Mart was great to replace it. But now the little black pieces that hold the very top propeller to the middle propeller pop off constantly on one of the helicopters, rendering it useless. I called the company to try to get a replacement part and customer service was awful!!!!! The guy said they don't send replacement parts and it's our fault if the helicopters crashed into each other. I have no idea if that's what happened to ours or not, but I pointed out that the company calls them Battling Helicopters and the conversation quickly went down hill from there. I now have a heartbroken 8-year-old and am hoping Wal-Mart will be as accommodating again."
3,bummed over air hog,I bought this helicopter for my husband for xmas and it was his favorite gift. It gets a few minutes of fly time before recharging for 10 minutes which isn't bad but the rotor blades broke after 2 days of playing.
5,Very fun to play with.,"The Micro X Copter is very small, lite weight and fun to fly. It is very durable except for the tail rotor which will eventually break. It is a good idea to find a place to get or order replacment tail rotors. The copter really only hovers in one place unless you get just the right amount of weight put on the nose some how. Then it will drift forward a little and then you can turn it around and go a different direction. Very fun and worth the cheap price. Don't forget more tail rotors or you will be out of fun."
4,Good little copter for the price,"Positives: Inexpensive and easy to get in the air. Mid-air electric trim control is helpful feature not on many others models.Downsides: Even weak air currents knock it off its path. Pretty hard to control. Only runs for 6 minutes before needing charge (although this is par for the course, all little copters like this get between 4 and 6 minutes)."
1,breaks ultra-fast,This is a fun toy if it works. I bought one for my son and it broke within 2 minutes. I got a new one and that broke within 5 minutes. The sturdiness is ultra disappointing and this toy is guaranteed to break within a few days of play and leave your child ultra disappointed. don't bother.
3,"Worthless, Save Your Money","I bought the Havoc Heli, and feel it is a complete waste of money. It won't lift off the floor, because it keeps spinning counterclockwise (the WHOLE helicopter, not just the blades). The instructions say to ""repeatedly press the Right Trim Button to stop it from spinning counterclockwise, but no matter how many times I click on the Trim button the helicopter just spins itself into a frenzy and won't lift off the floor. I even did the ""tail"" trim, but still it just spins. The instructions say make sure no fans, air, etc is blowing in the house. Even in still, calm air, the heli spins out of control. After 5 minutes the battery goes dead, so you have to charge it again for 30 minutes. This heli does NOT fly like you see in the commercials. You can either believe me, or the other comments. I say save your money."
3,Slightly Overrated,"This product isn't bad for the price - I'd probably buy it again. However, it is a bit overrated since the controls are very basic and it doesn't do much besides hover in place and spin around while hovering.As with most products, you get what you pay for."
2,Can't really steer it.,"The helicopters are good for a bit of fun. I bought two. It's disappointing that the controls are not better -- you can control whether they go up or down, but not much more than that."
3,Solid Indoor Fun For The Patient,"The Air Hogs Havoc Heli is fun, once you learn how to fly it. It will take at least 5 or 6 flights before you really understand how to fly it, and experiment with the controls. It is not for a room that has vents, I need to turn off the air conditioning, ceiling fans, or vents t really fly it and have control. The control is not as fine as they show in the TV commercials, so if one isn't patient and willing to try and try again, and willing to put up with its shortcomings, you will find it in the bottom of a toychest crushed by the weight of other toys. You will need a lot of AA batteries too (If I am remembering properly 6), to get it off the ground. It is delicate, but can take the abuse of running into walls or dropping to the floor. This is more of an adult toy, and buy that I mean it takes alot of patience. Do not expect a perfect first or second flight."
4,Virtually Indestructable!,"I got two of these for my Nephews (age 9 & 12) for Christmas and they LOVED them! They had these things up in the air within minutes. It was very easy for them to figure out. These Helicopters got more play time than any of the other toys (Guitar Hero, Nintendo etc). Even more impressive is that they seemed indestructable! Even after one of them ended up in the mouth of our Terrier - it was back up and running.Only thing I would mention on the negative side is to get plenty of batteries... 6 AA each!"
4,my kids like it,"you get a lot from this toy for the amount spent. the kids can go hours playing and having fun.it is not the most durable thing, but what can you get for under $30 bucks that lasts."
1,Don't bother,"The song selection is excellent!! That however is the one bright spot on this DVD. The audio is absolutely horrible and the video is equally bad. The fact that the DVD is named Raw:Live my expectations were low, but this could not even rise to that level. Save your money."
1,Don't believe this,"I was very disappointed with this product. I was mislead when I read in the product feature section that these shoes were ""Made in Italy"". That's not correct. They're made in China. The bottom is that these shoes are very uncomfortable."
4,Best thing you can do for a otherwise great phone!,"Almost doubled length of time between charges. Wished I could have found matching color, but, not really a big deal. It was a gift for a friend. And it was silver, not black as described. Still...... a more neutral color with other phone colors."
5,It's not about the books.,"A well-written and amazing story, and it's not about the books.Aaron Lansky saved Yiddish literature and everything a language and a literature tells us about a people, their culture, and their experiences. Rescuing a million and a half Yiddish books was a Herculean task, but it was a means to an end. Lansky sums it up with one Hebrew word, intentionally untranslated: heneini - here I am (Abraham's response when God called to him.). Yiddish literature was on the verge of extinction, and Lansky assumed responsibility for saving it - heneini.Read the book and whet your appetite for Yiddish literature (in translation, if necessary)."
1,Broke after 1 use,"I received this item, opened it up, put the battery in, and then 2 hrs later the display was broken."
5,Great! Multiple readings will not diminish your fun.,"I read this at a B&B in Wales; then was ecstatic to find it at Half Price Books in the States. I have lent it to many, but make strong demands for its return. You will want to make it part of your permanent collection."
5,A must read,"From start to finish, this was one of the most compelling books I have ever read.For those who have seen the American Gangster featuring Freeway Rick Ross, this goes beneath the surface. If you like political documentaries, this is an excellent companion piece."
4,Gary Webb book,We need more of these books to keep the people informed what government is up to behind the scenes and eventually make people realize they have the power to make any government's henchmen accountable. Perhaps we'll see the day when people's lives aren't ruined because they are willing to stand up and state the truth without the risk of being made into scapegoats and run over by the political/economic power of a government that is controlled by the greed of a few instead of the power of the people.
1,Pleased that this shameful story is PROVEN this time,"Terrific writing.Dates, times, people, facts that no one has been able to disprove.Am very uneasy to think such a coverup,created by persons in such high places,could be ignored for so long.Shame on the media giants."
2,Buy the Pixies albums instead,"There was something about the Pixies that is not captured here, even on the songs that are almost note for note remakes. Pray for a reunion."
5,tribute to the pixies,"i love this tribute! i love the pixies and i thought that their songs couldn't get any better than they were already...but i guess i was wrong. there are some covers on this album that are absolute genius! for example Far's interpretation of ""monkey gone to heaven"" is incredible. that is one of my favorite pixies songs, and now it's gotten even better. some songs sound practically the same though, just with minor alterations, but that's a good thing. it's nice to hear the same songs i've been listening to for years done in a differnt way. although i must add one thing that really upset me, and that is Reel Big Fish's cover of ""Gigantic"". i think they screwed up the song real bad..but that's a personal opinion. overall this is a great album and it also introduces you to many bands that you normally wouldn't hear of so my suggestion is buy it!"
4,Im shocked at all of these negative reviews!!,"I Loved this book!! Jake was an absolutely AWESOME hero. I adored the way he responded to Molly. I will admit that at times Molly was frustrating..but that is what made her so real..she was ABUSED for years!!! All of the deep seeded feelings and insecurities that came along with that ill treatment cannot possibly disappear overnight!!! Also, I found it a bit wild that Jake liked all of her dimples as well, but the point is that he loved her..ALL OF HER..for who she was...why is it so unbelievable that a man would like a curvy woman?? Its not...it happens, and in this case..even though Jake was a fox..it was totally believable. I adored this book..my only reason for not giving it 5 stars is because i felt that it could have had a bit shaved off from the middle. Other than that...LOVELY!! I definitely recommend it!"
2,Unbelievable!,"And I mean unbelievable in the worst possible way. The two main characters, Molly and Jake, seemed as if they could be Stepford Wives. Jake was too understanding, too patient, too loving and devoted. I never though there could be such a thing but the sweetness was beginning to choke me. Molly was too needy with zero self esteem. The love scenes are another bone of contention. I'm all for having full figured women appear in Romance novels with males that enjoy their figure. But did we realy need to hear about all of those dimples and how sexy they were? I think not."
3,Helpful but roaming,"An interesting book and certainly worth reading.However ,there are too many issues that are dealt with that are far more complex than this treatise.Much of it has merit in that the author has strong opinions, but I prefer James Carrol's treatment of the relationship between the Jews and the Church.S.J.Tagliareni author of Hitler's Priest"
1,Another point of view,"Philip Jenkins' recently-published book ""The New Anti-Catholicism: the last acceptable prejudice"" discusses the startling phenomenon of self-professed ""Catholics"" who, while rejecting the basic elements of the Catholic Faith as it has been understood for many centuries and giving vent to the sorts of anti-Catholic diatribe one associates with protestant fundamentalists of the most hair-raising variety, manage to avoid charges of bigotry because, after all, they are ""loyal sons and daughters of the Church""! Jenkins offers some useful criticisms of Wills' pronouncements and those of other dissenters who, while seemingly tailor made for membership in the Episcopal Church in America (or some other mainline protestant organization), perversely cling to an ersatz ""Catholic"" identity. This phenomenon is one of the more impenetrable mysteries of modern life."
2,"A ""selected"" history that is misguided and jumbled.","This book starts off promising, but takes two wrong turns after the halfway point of the book. First, the chapters on homosexuality and abortion read as ultra-lefist Catholic bashing until he seems to turn about face at the end of the chapters. Second, the last part of the book on St. Augustine seems out of place. I can kind of see what Willis was doing here, but it is a bit of a stretch. In sum, this book is ""choppy"" and frequently strays off the course of its purported thesis. It has its moments, but not enough of them to warrant spending too much time on this book."
1,Papal Sin: Book of Deceit,"Gary Wills one of the biggest ""anti-Catholic Catholics"" outdoes himself in this book full of lies and utter trash. He spouts such anti Catholic garbage such as Catholics think the Mass is ""magic"", he mocks an elderly Priest who he used to serve at the Alter with by mocking the Priests reverence for the Mass. He makes outrageous claims like the last supper had women at it but they were censored out by the Church. He claims to be Catholic but has no respect for the Priesthood calling Priests ""the peoples eunuchs"". He mocks laymen who believe in the Papacy and the doctrine of transubstantiation. He flipantly suggests God creates abortions when women have a miscarriage. Wills calls St Edith Stein a false saint (she died at Auschwitz)saying she was a tool of the Church. The list goes on. Many liberal Catholics find this book as detestable as Catholics. It's one thing to have opinions regarding the Church but another to publish a book full of lies."
4,Papal Sin,"Be not afraid! It's worth a serious read.The bottom line (for those who are not polarized by the title) is that this is a solid work of scholarship with a definite point of view. Anyone interested in religion/Catholicism should definitely give it consideration, as it will no doubt become a landmark work. Students of history may also find it worthwhile (particularly if their interest is church history or the Holocaust)."
1,Wills trades-in RC for PC,"Coming from a protestant background, I didn't care about ""orthodox opinions"" as much as facts. Apparently, Wills cares little for either. As I read this book, I kept wondering if the author ever stopped writing long enough to figure out that he was writing about a faith that he no longer holds. Yet, it's not as though he lost his religion. He simply traded it in for a new one. This became obvious once I noticed how he unquestioningly accepts every ""politically correct"" dogma of democratic liberalism, and with such docility. Then, he turns around and uses his new-found infallible authority to clobber his old one. Honest and courageous? Only for fellow devotees and fawning reviewers."
1,Nothing but Anger,"What I hoped would be an informative, well-written book turned out to be nothing but a vitriolic bashing of the Roman Catholic Church. Mr. Wills manipulates scripture quite well to uphold the points he attempts to make. Unfortunately, those even moderately familiar with scripture will recognize the manipulation, as entire verses on the subject are intentionally left unquoted. For example, Mr. Wills claims that the papacy ""invented"" the concept of the Holy Eucharist being the truepresence of Christ. If Mr. Wills had only quoted the apostle Paul completely, readers would have learned that Paul himself acknowledged this fact. I am not Roman Catholic, so my question to Mr. Wills is, if he doesn't like the heat (in the Roman church) why doesn't he get out of the kitchen?"
2,Incomplete !,"I'm just going to review the DVD, as I'm sure others will rate the actual movie, and rate it poorly (I think the movie's bad too, but sometimes bad can be good!).I was really dissapointed, though. Several minutes of the TV version were cut, for some reason. Many DVDs add scenes to the movie, so this is inexplicable. Those were hilariously bad scenes, too. I don't know what they were thinking.The DVD also doesn't have any extras, hence the 2 stars.Belz..."
5,Great Watch!,"Got this for my husband. He loved it. Looks great, keeps good time, comfortable.I would recommend it to all guys that would like a nice looking watch for everyday wear."
5,Excellent watch!,"Very nice looking. Simple and clean...set it and forget it. Price is right.I have looked at lot of watches with a range of different functions, sizes and looks. I finally came to realize that I only need, and want, the time, day and date. Anything else just clutters up the face.I am very satisfied!"
1,Disappointing Quality - Poor Durability,"I was up-beat about ordering this Citizen watch. I don't normally do as much research as I had on this, but nevertheless it paid off for me (or, so I thought). After wearing the watch (for work only) for two months, the leather band is almost completely worn out. It looks worse than the leather band on the $12.95 Wal-mart casual watch band that I wore for 3+ years. This watch now looks like a cheap knock off. The band is cracked and pealing already. The timepiece itself appears fine and keeps accurate time - so far.If the band is indicative of the quality of the rest of the watch, I am probably already on ""borrowed time"" with this timepiece.Citizen should be ashamed of putting something on the market like this. What ARE you thinking ????First Citizen - Last Citizen !!!"
3,"nice watch, short wristband","I already have purchased one eco-drive watch previously (and loved it), and was looking forward to wearing this beauty. I'm 6'2"" (avg. build, not musclebound) but my wrists are apparently much thicker than the ""average"" person this watch was made for. I had to use the very last strap to secure it around my wrist, which made it look funny, so I ended up returning it."
3,Nice watch -- toxic leather strap!!!,"This is a beautiful basic watch with all of the features I wanted including solar power, day, and date. The size is perfect for my smallish wrist. It's comfortable to wear. Unfortunately, the leather strap it comes with is causing bad skin irritation. I read about another reviewer's (who reviewed the black and silver version of this watch) comment on the same problem and didn't believe it until it happened to me, too. I wore it just one day and I had a red, itchy ring around my wrist for a whole week! I have had other watches with leather straps and have never had such problems. This watch is going back."
3,Worth the dollar I paid for it.,"This old time video was pretty funny. You will see some older cars etc, but the artsy type of production cuts into the footage unfortunately. I guess it was a hit in its day."
5,My Kind of Quilting,"I love to quilt. I love patterns that do not have applique, curved seams, or take a tremendous amount of time and effort. I have a full time night nurse job and like projects that look great and are different and entertaining. This book fulfills all the above. The paterns are easy, even for the beginning quilter and look great. The topics are fun and unusual. Ms Bono has let us tap into her very creative mind with patterns that bring smiles to the quiltist as well as those who see the finished projects. There's a lot of variety here. This is well worth adding to your library."
2,Technical Difficulties,"Is anyone else having technical difficulties with this set? My DVD player is unable to read Disc One of each set. The other discs play fine, but when I try to play Disc One I get the message ""Wrong Disc Type"" and my player actually spits it out. Come on, The Mole People isn't that bad. I've already exchanged the set once and had the same problem. Is there something I'm missing???"
3,shame on universal movies,"For get best Buy. Shame on universal for being so cheesey with all the great cheese. I love all the movies they put out,some of the best.But why do they have to make you work for buying them.I got the first set reasonbly priced,then found out about the second set by chance. Been waiting for the deadly mantis for ever and then they put it out in a volume set when it should be by itself just like the incredible shrinking man.I got the second set on EBAY for alot less than what Best Buy was selling it for.WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO ALREADY BOUGHT THE FIRST SET? Now you want to sock it to them for both.Maybe they should pay more attention to what people want,enough with the upteen editions of the great universal monster flicks.Start getting some of the other great movies out.As for the second volume its great,never saw DR.CYCLOPS but I loved it great movie. And the others for speak for themselfs,All great classic CHEESE,better than anything put out today."
5,Golden B(ee)s,"This collection of classics, Vol. 1 and 2 should be part of every sci-fi lover's film shelf. I haven't seen some of these films for years, and welcome them home like long-lost relatives: ""The Leech Woman"" with Collen Gray, ""Cult of the Cobra"" with Richard Long and Marshall Thompson, and ""Deadly Mantis"" with William Hopper. For sci-fi fans, this collection is a winner!"
3,DJ Q - Music As We Know It,"DJ Q has always been one of the less-heralded names in house music, but listening to his 3rd album, _Music As We Know It_, you'd never guess why. ""The Birth of a Beautiful Thing"" has a great jazzy vibe, without slipping too far into soporifics, while ""System 600"" has some hints of Latin percussion. ""Feel It"" is straightforward in its funk-guitar groove (even if it doesn't develop that much; this holds doubly true for ""Bitchslapped""), but the smoothness of ""Over U Now"" elides over those issues. ""Just One Hour"" and ""Things Will Never Change"" are pure house pleasure, and ""Season's End"" drifts into the land of trip-hop, complete with weather effects. ""Fog Bound"" gets slightly more tech-y, and ""Your Move"" lays down some mellow breaks. A nice, understated album."
1,Stopped reading it,"I stopped reading it after he said he didn't believe in satan and hell. What a dipstick! Universalism?! Are you kidding me? This is so far from the bible it's not even funny. I'm not reading this hogwash; good thing I only checked it out from the library. Universalism is not what the bible or Jesus taught, you guys! The only way to GOD is through Jesus Christ and sadly no not every one is going to heaven unless they accept Jesus. I will never pick up another book by these quacks again. Take the bible at what is says every body. Don't listen to people like these two. GOD wants to save every body and GOD is love, however, it being offered to everyone doesn't mean it automatically covers everyone."
5,Simply Awesome,"This was the best that I have ever viewed on TV. It was the most entertaining, interesting, and simply the best thing I have ever watched on TV. I proceded to buy it and watch it over and over again.The funk brothers were awesome as were their background singers. The lead singers were great and the brothers just brought the best out of them. Joan Osborne was simply unreal in her performances. You have to see this; it is so uplifting with so much trash floating around today. I have viewed this 5 or 6 times and it just gets better. I have invited friends and family members over to view this. It is a must!!!!!"
4,Good Historical Information,"It's about time that some of these artists finally get their recognition. It's not so much that they are such great performers, but their body of work is incredible"
5,This is the Bomb!,Great movie! A must for every music lover. It's great that these wonderful musicians can get the recognition they so richly deserve! You will glean plenty of info on Motown and it's founders and participants. It's the kind of video you can watch over and over because the music and the artists are just that great. Well done. Buy it you won't be sorry.
5,Standing in the Shadows of Love.,"The Funk Brothers were true brothers who loved the music and each other. It's true, they could have stood a chicken in front of a microphone and recorded a great record, but the vocal performances are outstanding on this DVD. Joan Osborne's ""What Becomes of the Broken Hearted"" will blow your socks off."
5,I have seen it a dozen times - so far,"Honestly, there is not much to add to the wonderful reviews already written. I thought the stories, like the pig feet and cigars, got a bit tedious, but wow! I loved the music. My only criticism of the music is to wonder where they found this guy Ben Harper, and why did they give him such fine songs to sing. He has no sense of rhythm, and he can't sing a lick. The other modern singers were great.To me, this movie, Down from the Mountain, and Buena Vista Social Club are must have music videos. I will watch these movies at least once a year for the rest of my life I am sure."
3,Just OK,"Galway is obviously one of the greatest flutists of this or any generation. Having said that, I must say that I find this recording only mediocre. The first problem that any modern flutist must deal with in these pieces is one of historical accuracy. OK, so the instrument he plays was not even invented until the early 19th century but nonetheless, the approach should at least tip its hat to the voluminous research of the last fifty years. Galway just blasts on through with the way that he thinks it should go, historical accuracy be damned. Second, he seems strangely disembodied from his playing on this disc. I am left wondering if he wouldn't just prefer to be playing something flashier than J.S. Bach. If you want a modern version, get your hands on Julius Baker's. For a more historically informed performance, try Janet See's excellent two disc set."
4,"Good, but Not Great","The enclosed design is perfect for lampshades that attach to the bulb. I also like the fact that they don't burn as hot as conventional bulbs, and they obviously use much less energy. The only problem I have with them is that the light gives off a very slight greenish tint. This doesn't really bother me too much, but it bugs my wife a lot. She's an art director and is very sensitive to color, so it may just be a mental thing for her. So, the final verdict is that they won't be used in living areas (like our living room, bathroom, etc...), but they will be used in hallways and outside our home. Ultimately, you'll have to buy one and test it out for yourself to see if the color difference in the light bothers you or not."
2,Not what I expected,"If your main interest is simply to see pictures it's a beautiful book. If you are looking for useful references about the park (trails, directions, maps etc.) this is not it. For reading and looking -- Not a useful reference book."
4,"A brief novel, but a good one.","What's particularly interesting about Chaos And All That is how Sola Liu takes a wickedly humorous approach to describe growing up during China's Cultural Revolution, which is unlike anything I've ever read about that period."
2,It's a shame,"It's a shame that some people are under the impression that this new dvd release by Shout Factory contains new copies of this great series. Unfortunately these are the same edited prints that were previously released by Infinity. Although Infinity went out of business before it could release the 4th season, all the 4th season prints in the Shout Factory release are transfers made by Infinity before it went bankrupt.It's a shame that such a great series has been so mishandled by the companies that have put it on dvd.If you already have the Infinity sets then there is no reason to get this release."
2,Not well made.,"I guess it's true , you get what you pay for. I wish I had read the description of this a little better, I wouldnt have bought it. Anyway, after wearing it a few hours it just wouldn't stay in position and a few times the zipper didn't close properly. I will buy one made of leather now."
3,OK,NOT ONE OF JOAN HESS'S GREAT ONES BUT STILL OK. GOT KINDA LACKING IN THE MIDDLE AND A LITTLE SILLY.
3,Not what I expected,"I was hoping to find Charo doing more latin tunes or spanish guitar along the lines of ""Guitar Passion"". I don't know how I missed that this was a disco album."
3,awesome,"This book is awesome, I am still getting used to how to use it but it is great, thanks for making this available in eboook format."
3,"Starts strong, grows increasingly esoteric and verbose","The first half of this book is enlightening. The chapters on the ""Rushmoreans"" - Jefferson, Washington, Roosevelt and Lincoln - are provocative. Their leadership style is explored in detail, and connections are made to the effective management styles of many of today's best corporate leaders. After that, things go downhill. The second half is far too esoteric for its own good, including dense, highly detailed chapters on Robert Owen, John Stuart Mill and others. I skipped through these sections out of sheer tedium (although the sections on Drucker and Deming are somewhat engaging). In short, a difficult and challenging book (which is a compliment) but weighted down by too much dry writing and page after page of minutiae you'll be tempted to skip."
1,Not much of a book,"Larry recounts the 1992 U.S. presidential campaign, with all the inside information and insight that could be garnered just by reading the paper or watching TV during the relevant period. In other words, Larry offers no inside scoop at all. The book just rehashes the campaign in more or less chronological order, and I could've written it. Some book, huh? Along the way, Larry does manage to bungle a fact or 2 (E.g., claiming a wacky question during Gennifer Flowers' press conference was asked by a reporter, rather than the Howard Stern show flunkie who really asked it. I don't think Larry can bring himself to say the words ""Howard Stern"", so perhaps that was the problem.). If interested in the 1992 campaign/election, try ALL's FAIR by Mary Matalin and James Carville or STRANGE BEDFELLOWS by Tom Rosensteil instead.Update 2003: As of this writing, 302 used available starting at $0.01. Larry, maybe you should buy these all up for $3.02?"
2,fashion rendering with color,"Would have been useful if 98 % of the book was actually in color, not black & white. Was extremely expensive for such a short book printed in this way."
4,great,"I always use these bars as a pick me up on golf course, especially if I've forogte no eat breakfast!"
4,"Nice Ending, but Could be Better","This is supposed to be the last volume of Saint Tail (where the story ends); volume 7 is full of little stories, and book 6 also contains a few...I thought that this was a nice volume of Saint Tail, although it wasn't as funny as the first two. However, the new thief (and former enemy of Saint Tail's mother)Rosemary provided some humorous dialogue.I only read volumes 1 and 2 before this, so I don't know a lot about the stuff in between.The artwork is really cute and bright, and the characters are adorable, but I think that the ending was a little bit weak.Oh well! Nevertheless, this should be very enjoyable for any Saint Tail fan!"
2,A lot of money and not that great,"I thought I was investing in a really great set of tweezers when I bought these. Although they look great and are made of quality material, they just don't grip that great.My first pair (which I bought for less than $10 at the grocery store) would grab single hairs that were barely visable. I find that these require a small bit of growth before they will grab on.So they're not that great for tweazing eyebrows, but they've worked fine for splinters and small tasks.I should have just gone to the local beauty supplier and tried some out.Live and learn."
5,great product,"I finally decided to try and find something like these ,, i am only sorry i didn't look for them sooner!!they work great and such a simple design, well worth the $$$."
4,Good Camera for a Great Cause,"The Polaroid I533P is a great camera, it has a decent zoom, and pictures com out clear the only promblem with this camera is that the battery life is really short only had for two weeks and went though two packs."
1,Stopped working,"We had this camera for about 5 days before it wouldn't turn on. Just a green flashing light by the controls, and no picture on the display. Resetting the camera by opening and closing the battery case door worked for a while, but now it will not turn on at all. Camera has never been dropped, in perfect physical condition. Caveat emptor."
5,Perfect,"So we decided to ""try"" head phones that were different than the more expensive and hard to find factory ones. The Pyle plvwh1 duel channel arrived quickly and immediately worked! Would highly recommend to anyone."
1,Didn't work & manufacturer wont respond,It looks like it should be easy to use but doesn't include detailed instructions or troubleshooting. When I couldn't get it to work in my SUV I emailed for help and got no response. BIG disappointment for my son who wanted to watch DVD's in the car. Complete waste of money.
5,Love it,"A steal at 10.99 imho.This neck stash holds my new Kindle(2010 model), phone, passport, wallet and sansa mp3 player.If the back panel was see through, I could read my kindle without taking it out of the neck stash, that would be even better :)Thank you Lewis N Clark & Amazon.Edit; If you want to be able to close the top flap, the Lewis N. Clark DELUXE Neck Stash will fit all this and you'll be able to close the flap."
2,disappointed,"after reading San FRancisco, I thought that Darkening of the Light would be a continuation, but to my disappointment I found this book very difficult to read."
5,A Terrific Romp Through Nostalgia,"Denny Fried's A Tongue In The Sink is a must-read for anyone who grew up in small-town USA, especially if you lived in Catskill, NY as I did. Who can forget the big kids and their torture, first girl friends, the swimming hole, early jobs, elementary and high school, and that first talk with mom or dad about the ""birds and the bees."" Don't miss this one."
5,The Call,"A book well worth reading. Cynthia Berkeley captured the very essence of a Spiritual Romance between her two main characters. Caitlin Montgomery and Simon Noble are two people, spiritually connected and who love eachother, but keep pushing eachother away. I found myself rooting for Caitlin and Simon the whole time while I was reading the story. Through a series of adventures at a Yoga Retreat in Costa Rica they grow closer and ultimately give into what was meant to be. Cynthia's description of this Yoga Retreat is so in depth that as the reader reads the story begins to feel that he or she is actually there in this incredibly beautiful, serene place."
2,Dull roots rock,"I had never heard Fred Eaglesmith's music before picking up this CD, and I can't say after listening to it that I think that I was missing anything. Though rather high on energy, Eaglesmith doesn't seem to have put much effort into the songwriting. The whole disc just kind slid by in musical mass, without any of the songs jumping out and grabbing my attention. Maybe I just expected too much from the disc's clever title."
2,Fatal Marton,"Heppner's Lohengrin is simply amazing- warm, yet ringing at the same time, without sounding forced at all. Truly stunning. I find Sweet's singing also quite warm, expansive and expressive, actually. And the conducting here is beautiful- very sensitive. Even Lieferkaus' non-diomatic interpretation is nonetheless clean and apt but good Heavens!! When is Marton NOT a liability?? Her Ortrud is incredibly disturbing- and not in a good way! This is the sort of wobble that simply upsets the ENTIRE performance, EVERY time she screeches a note...or rather, heaves herself around one. 2 stars unavailable for her 'involvement', sadly. A terrible shame."
2,Hole After Four Hours,I used this stash at a theme park and after four hours there was already a hole along the bottom seam of the front pouch.
4,Worked well,"Bought this for my daughter who was going to Europe on a summer school trip and for myself for future trips.Plenty of secure pockets which used both zipper and velcro closures.Seemed sturdy, neck strap was comfortable but was overly long and lasted thru trip without problem.Good value for price paid, quality of materials seems good.Hard to hide under clothing due to length of neck strap but functioned wellHappy with my purchase."
3,Would like it to be a bit longer,"This pouch is lightweight and comfortable to wear, and I liked the very adjustable strap. However, I would like for the pouch to be a couple of inches longer to accommodate the length of a standard boarding pass. I was surprised that it was too short as it seems to me that travel documents would the the most likely thing to store here, but it could not be closed unless I bent the passes which then made them difficult to remove. A minor gripe, overall I'm satisfied."
4,Practical Application of the Interiors we Love,"I've had the privilege of spending quite a bit of time in France, staying in a charming Chambres D'Hotes in Provence or first rate Hotels and private homes in Paris. Each setting is unique, and showcases the fabulous French interiors I love. Of all the books available on this subject, I find this one most practical, realistic to the subject, and useful with or without spending great amounts of money. The French have a way of making the most beautiful interiors look effortless; this book shows you some of the real thought and work behind that affect. My copy is well worn, and I enjoy it every time I read it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODECT!!!!!!,If you put this on your pole the squirrels will chew right through it within a week. This product is totally useless. Get a METAL squirrel baffle!!!!
2,Squirrel baffle,"The only reason i'm not happy with the baffle is that the piece that actual baffle goes over is not fit right. Screws came with this round piece that fits onto the pole. The screws are too big for the holes and if you put them in there too far, the plastic round piece breaks.Because I can't use that small piece on the pole, I can't put the actual baffle up. I am not happy about the product design - that round piece."
4,opinion,"The oven work great, the only defect was that one surport was not secured very well and came off."
3,Hard to get a crispy crust.,"I've used the Cuisinart PIZ-100 on a consistent basis since I got it several months ago. My typical pizza is a Tombstone Brick Oven Style Cheese Pizza topped with half a can of drained, petite diced Red Gold brand tomatoes. The tomatoes add extra cooking time. I have to let the top get really brown in order to get a crispy crust. If I pull the pizza out when it looks done, the crust is soggy.This is not caused by the addition of the tomatoes (that only increases the cooking time). If I don't add any topping, I still have to overcook the top to get a crispy crust. In our conventional oven, the pizza is thoroughly and evenly cooked. The Cuisinart doesn't do that for me.If you don't mind a softer crust, the Cuisinart does its job well. But if you want a nice crispy crust, you'll probably have to stick with your conventional oven."
5,PROTECT A CATH,THIS PRODUCT IS PERFECT FOR KEEPING MY CHEST CATH DRY DURING A SHOWER. IT'S THE PERFECT SIZE. AND I GOT IT FOR A GREAT PRICE ON AMAZON.BY CAROL HULICK (GAMER RHI'S MOM)
2,Disappointing at best,"With Tom Siebel's reputation as a visionary of One-to-One marketing and a software innovator, this book was obvious, fundamental, and predictable, with very little that hasn't been said better and more astutely by other writers i.e. Evans and Wurstler, Shapiro and Varian. This is a collection of the same old success stories culled from the same old interviews and the same old articles. If you're really interested in the underlying changes in the business world that the Internet brings, read ""Information Rules' by Shapiro and Varian or ""Blown to Bits"" by Evans and Wurstler. Heck, even Bill Gates' book ""Business @ the Speed of Thought"" had more insight and better stories than this."
2,Superficial collection of stories,":-( The book somewhat disappointed me. It is not well-structured, mostly consisting of some anecdotal stories from famous Internet companies. Most of the offered advice and strategies are very generic and very basic. Topics are not explored at depth, but only identified. I would only recommend this book to a person who is completely new to the world of online business. Do not seek in-depth wisdom in it..."
5,Simple yet worth every penny,"I purchased this watch to replace a Kenneth Cole piece, I've never had so many compliments on a watch, especially for how little it relatively cost. Very plain and simple, I couldn't ask for better at that price."
2,Too Technical. Good for Students maybe...,"But not for someone who wants to learn at his own pace.It starts with the Matricial definition of derivatives and assumesa complete knowledge of Matrix Theory.This, at least for me, is neither intuitively nor psychologicallyfriendly. Other math books, which are not even targetted atundergraduates are easier and more fun to follow(e.g. Algebra by B.L. van der WaerdenAlgebra: Volume I)Boring, maybe good for someone at college who has a teacher andneed to pass an exam.If you are a math nerd who can follow books like:TheoremProofCorollaryPropositionProofCorollaryPropositionLemmaProofCorollaryTheoremProofCorollary...[Some Explanatory Text]...TheoremProofCorollaryPropositionProofCorollaryPropositionLemmaProof...[Figure]...Then this is the book for you."
5,Fabtech Spare tire mount,"excellent mount, very easy to install and the quality is definitely top notch and consistent with what has made fabtech products rise thru the ranks over the years. excellent work!"
2,Ripped tights!,These tights ripped the second time I wore them! I was disappointed as the black pair I have has lasted me two years!
1,"Great Highlights Disc, But, No Match!","Althrough this is a budget release of highlights from the 1970 RCA recording, it'll no match for the recently-released full price version, which featured narrations from Ms. Price, taken from her popular story book."
4,A lifesaver.,"I travel CONSTANTLY for my job. As all of this travel is through rural North Dakota I have found my iPod and dock invaluable.PROS: Charges iPod while playing. Convenient dock adjusts up and down to accomodate a full range of areas. TONS of adapters for iPod. Relatively durable.CONS: Display is occassionally hard to read. Hardish to scroll through stations (although I think there's a memory preset but have yet to figure it out after throwing instructions). Only relatively durable. Mine did sort of break. I had used this thing for 8 hours a day four days a week for seven months and thrown it in luggage, my purse, my carry all when the movable function ceased to be movable. Luckily it still worked and I just super glued it in the straight position."
5,Great Start to Your Day,It does not take many words to say so much to brighten your day and make you feel so good. Just a quick read at the beginning of your day will let you see things in a different light.
5,Very good,Very good. My grandchildren love this. Bought it for a young man who broke his jaw so he is really enjoying it.
2,"Just ""o.k "" if you want a ""Frosty"" or a rich shake","Obviously, by looking at the other reviews people think this stuff is either really good or really bad. I think it is all according to your taste and what you are expecting for this price. I ordered packets from two different web sites and they both taste ok just like a frosty/rich shake ordered from a drive thru window. It was ok but I wouldn't pay the price for it again. I found a recipe from the Serendipity 3 restaurant where you make your own Frozen Hot Chocolate by adding tiny bits of REAL chocolate, a bit of milk, cocoa,and some ice into a blender. I have a feeling that is the recipe that taste much more like what Oprah said was so good and more equivalent to what the restaurant actually serves. If you want more than just an expensive milkshake I would try the recipe using real chocolate and stay away from this drive thru milkshake mix."
2,Horrible Packaging.,"While I received my 3 set in a timely fashion, the packaging was horrible. One of my packets was cut and the mix had spilled out on to remainder packets and box. I'm only glad I didn't purchase the set with the glass in it."
2,Not stainless steel,"This grill grid was described as ""porcelain wire stainless steel cooking grid"".I ordered it and the grid arrived today. To make sure it was stainless steel as described I put my magnet on it and it stuck like glue. I could hardly pull it off. This is not Porcelai covered stainless steel wire. It is steel covered wire advertised as stainless steel."
2,"Denny's Memoirs, as told to His Dog","Sorry. Read this book and the earlier one, and just didn't think it was all that good. My wife and I are the owners of two Papillons, and I thought these books would be fun. The first wasn't that bad, really, but this one totally blew it, in my opinion. Full of ""Denny's stories"", not Genieve's. Mostly his rants on things, or attempted humorous observations, and next to nothing truly presented from a dog's-eye view of the world.If you are truly a dog lover looking for an entertaining read, I'd give my recommendation to ""What Wendell Wants"" by Jenny Lee"
3,"""Good"" for a laugh!","This review is good for a laugh!Is there anything wrong with this book? I didn't realize that it would be a direct copy of a ""now"" uncopyrighted book until I read the inside first page. The copy of the antique pages is difficult to read as it was ""copied"", not reprinted. All the pages have been printed on ""one side only"" and stacked with the bound side to the right of all the written pages - meaning that you read from the back of the book to the the front cover. For a small book it is thicker than should be. Other than all those things it's great!I paid about +- $20 but decided not to return it, as it is an Angell family genealogy that I have been looking for and a conversation piece to boot."
4,Decent Effort,Probably Phill's most creative effort. This album as usual has great support from his Roxy alliances. Eno' Miss Shapiro is certainly a stand out also the them song Diamond Head has some excellent guitar work.Big Day almost an Eno song and could fit well on any of his albums especially Taking Tiger Mountain. I like the style of this one.
3,They send something much different than the photo,"This was VERY disappointing as I ordered theslim set as advertised in the Amazon product description,and they sent me the THINPAK.No art work, no little book thats supposed to be included,and all the DVDs stuffed into a single DVD plastic box,like the ones at blockbuster.The one they send you is NOT the one pictured and described.If you are a series collector like me, shop elsewhere!"
5,One of the Best TV Shows of all time.,"The X-Files started hitting it's stride at the end of Season 2. Seasons 3 and 4 built upon that and in my opinion were the best seasons of this long running show. While Season 3 wrapped up a continuing conspiracy storyline, Season 4 had more stand alone episodes like the episode ""Home"" which after originally airing, was banned for a time from network television. Contains all 24 episodes in the slim packaging so it takes up less space on your movie shelf."
4,A fine first entry in the series.,"Fire Logic is remarkable not for its story -- a passable examination of a fantasy land at war with an invading force -- so much as its setting and characters. Shaftal is a land of elemental affinities in which men and women are equally likely to be farmers or warriors, healers or craftsmen, and same-sex relationships are viewed as entirely ordinary. All this is presented, likewise, as ordinary, and it's quite refreshing as such.The characters are the real driving force here. Reluctant commander Emil Paladin's trials and tribulations as he commands a detachment of troops in guerilla warfare against the Sainnites. Medric's hope for a future free of war. Zanja's loneliness and her building romantic tension with the tragic, drug-addicted metalsmith Karis. Each character makes a strong impression, and I wish the rest of the series were more readily available so I might continue to read about them."
2,Couldn't make it through 60 pages without nodding off,"Fire Logic by Laurie Marks is the first in the Elemental Logic series that received decent (4 to 4 1/2 stars) by numerous reviewers. I liked the title, and since I had no other books on my nightstand (gasp!) I picked it and the sequel Earth Logic up too. I force-fed myself the first 60 pages or so and finally gave up and would only give it two stars. I say two because it wasn't offensive or stupid, just uninteresting.It was so boring that I can't really explain much about it, other than it's shamelessly derivative of the Lord of the Rings writing style (which I hated in its original form). There is one main race that occupies a land, with some fringe races living on the outskirts who are the magic-wielders. Then a big bad war-like race comes in and takes over as the evil oppressors. One of the magic-wielder women is like a shaman or something. Blah blah blah.Don't waste your time."
5,Great book for appropriate person.,"I use this book with my clients who are in year 1 through 5 of their career management strategy, or with any entry to just-above-entry level career person who simply has not interviewed much.Although one previous reviewer attempts to discredit the book by citing a few under par examples, many of the questions reflect true interview situation questions and many of the answers are helpful to those unskilled in interviewing techniques.The book operates like flash cards that you can tear apart. My recommended approach to using it is to tear out 10 - 20 questions you want to answer expecially well, try using their answers or your own in mock interview situations with friends and associates, and use this as the tool it is meant to be used: One that promotes interview practice and thoughtful reflection.I wholeheartedly validate the experience of those who have found this book invaluable. Many people do."
5,Great collection of Bofill songs.,"But why wasn't my favorite of all her songs, ""Summer Days"" included in this album?"
1,"Subjective ""Christianity""!","Ankerberg and Weldon would send any good-willed religion straight to Hell for not conforming to their idealism. With all of their inflated degrees they somehow missed the course on humanity. The many religions they ""slam"" are institutions that keep people out of our prisons and give spiritual hope and a sense of personal worth. Would a true ""Christian"" condemn something like that? I looked up ""cult"" in the dictionary, it defines any group that follows a set of principles or beliefs. Are we to suppose,from this book, that a cult is a dark, secret organization? Come on! The Authors omitted one ""cult""; their own."
4,Classic '80s Drive-in Movie! :o),"I remember seeing this movie when it was released in 1985. It's a cute story about a guy that moves with his parents to California. Upon arriving at a new school, his classmates soon discover that his Dad runs the Paradise Motel, ""get a free lei with every stay""...this movie could only be pulled off in the '80s! It's cheesy, none of the actors are recognizable & it's a total 'B' movie but it has a lot of charm. Even though this movie has been largely forgotten, & if you like obscure '80s teen comedies, then this one is a good choice."
1,couldn't even watch it,I really love Westlife so I thought I order their DVD I waited and waited until finally it came. I put it in my dvd player and was surprised that it said NOT NSTC or something along those lines. I was really looking forward to watching performances and videos that I have not seen before. Now I have to send it back! It is truly a big disappointment!p.s I'd give this item a 0 star!
5,Best sheets ever!,"Sheets did not shrink in the wash. They fit a deep mattress with ease. Extremely soft, silky feeling. My husband commented on them stating they felt like hotel sheets. Which meant he likes them. I'm looking forward to purchasing another set soon."
2,Looks promising but does not deliver,"I purchased a number of Rubis tweezers believing the many positive reviews. After many months of use, I have gradually gone back to my far better and more economical Tweezerman tweezers. They don't look as pretty as Rubis, but the Tweezerman tweezers work well.The problem with Rubis is that their slender point form is not really fully functional. They are so finely made that they lack grasping ability. The grabbing end of the points is so small, the hairs slip away from them. You end up repeatedly trying to pluck a hair. It can become a big waste of time using the Rubis. Additionally, the thin points can distort and the ends do not stay lined up.The Rubis tweezers are just O.K. but in view of the price, I expected far, far more. Rubis does not deliver professional performance."
1,What was that smell...,STRONG solvent/gasoline smell. It went straight into the trash. It was supposed to be a replacement strap for a diaper bag so there was no way we were going to try to use it.
5,"As Good As ""Dinner with...""","My review of ""Dinner With a Perfect Strangeer"" - I read this book in an hour flat - I couldn't put it down. It really expresses who Jesus really is - God who wants a personal relationship with each of his children. I loved the small discussion about other religions. I've given this book away as a ""good, quick read"" in order to break the ice for witnessing.""Day With..."" further presents Jesus's desire to have a personal relationship with each person. I loved the discussion about despising religion and its binding laws and traditions."
3,Not for programming newbies,"If you are not already familiar with computer programming paradigms, this is not the book for you."
3,Behind the curve.,"Update this to Lingo 7, and you've got yourself another sale. Until then, forget it."
1,what a shame,When it was taken from the box and plugged in it did not function properly. We did not open it for over 30 days as it was a present and I had contacted the company that provided it to me and they have yet to advise if they will accept it on a return. I have always had a good experience buying through amazon until I bought this product.
2,I have a problem,The set up is wonderful. Love the look. The radio works fine. My problem is that most of the CD's I try to play skip. To correct this problem I have to lay it on its back. So...I am here at Amazon shopping for another type unit.
3,Jute Box,Jute box has great sound and plays well.Bubbles do not flow around in the tubes as expected.It needs plug ins to attach external speakers or head set intoAlso a way to adjust the Bass and Trebele speakers
1,Alabama. Like the show Hee Haw....but a band,"There are many types of suck, but this has to be the tenth ring of suck. I mean look at these guys, they're totally gay for each other. Who wears mathching white outfits, guys who have spent way too much time together on long tour bus rides that's who. How may times do you think they had to repose those guys because they kept getting skoal stains on themselves.And that damn hair, what the heck man, are you kidding me, a no BS mullet. And not, hey I havn't been to the barber in awhile but a... ""HEY EVERYBODY LOOK HOW BIG MY MULLET IS""!!! Classic."
1,"Yes, Satch was fabulous, but...","...there is nothing fabulous at all about this mess of a compilation. Despite the wealth of recordings spanning Armstrong's 50-year career, there really isn't a good, all-encompassing anthology available, leaving us to piece together his early jazz, his mid-career standards, and his late pop. Check Amazon's ""essentials"" list above for some best bets, but by all means don't start here."
1,Shallow,"I happened to found it on Zune and I scrolled down the title list. I can't believe they include so little and call that the ""only"" classical CD you'll ever need. The one who came up with this album title is stupid. It made me pretty mad cause there're a lot more great classical pieces out there. Anyone who owns this only show how shallow he/she is.And it's not even good for beginners cause just the title is misleading enough! We won't want beginners to get the impression that's the best thing and that's it!"
1,no cable hook up!,"I got this machine for christmas.There is no screwed coax cable port! I don't have a cable box, I just have a cable coming out of my wall.There is nothing in the back of this machine to accommodate this. I need some sort of adapter to get from the cable to red, yellow, and white split cables.What's up with that, anyone know what this adapter is called?Phil"
4,A wonderful start up book,"New to cheese making I wanted to get the lowdown on what it takes, plus have a bank of recipies to try out.This book delivers all this plus lots of very nice anecdotes of other people's experiences and successes.Being American based, this book has all its weights and measures in imperial. This is the only fault I can find with the book, in this day an age where only 3 countries in the world still use Imperial, I would have thought that metric equivalents would have been provided, or at the very least a conversion table in the appendices. Hence the four stars, get that sorted and I'd give it a five no problem.Measurement conversions aside, I'm looking forward to trying out some of the many recipese provided in the book, they look great!"
5,Best Book on Cheese Making Around,"Allow me to be brief: this is the best instructional manual available for those who wish to make cheese from home, as I have for years. Even though not a novice, Ms. Carroll's tome has taught me additional insight that will allow me to tackle more complicated and delicate cheeses. Outstanding explanations (in depth) on techniques, ingredients and sterility. Excellent recipes. Cannot recommend this book highly enough."
3,Too repetitive and not enough practical,"If you had a cookbook on how to make pies and every new recipe contained the exact same ten pages on crust making, your ardor and enthusiasm would soon wane. Wanted to make my own cheese at home and not in fully equipped laboratory. I could've dealt with that but the authors continued to insert their own home spun homilies about their personal contacts and not about the subject for which I purchased the book. The part about ""breaking"" was especially confusing. Want to make cheese? You decide."
3,Difficult to use,"Aside from the general complaints given by other reviewers, the list of proper nouns on both the CD and the text version of this dictionary is awful.As an example, searching for ""Cuba"" in the electronic version yields one result, Guantanamo Bay (yes, the prison), but no entry for the country itself. Searching for ""South Africa"" yields the transliteration of Cape Town but once again the country itself is nowhere to be found. The text version is even worse.Text is hard to read, examples of usage are hard to distinguish from one another because they aren't marked properly with different type sets or styles. Instead of ""or"" when showing alternative ways of using a word, the dictionary uses huozhe, the chinese equivalent, which makes it very hard for someone not familiar with reading large amounts of Chinese characters to see what's really being said.The cheap price and comprehensiveness are attractive, but you are better off buy some other dictionary if you can."
2,Quite ridiculous,"Not much sense in the fact that a descendant from Amaris can conquer the Inner Sphere with a couple of regiments of pirates and some stupid impersonations.Also, it burns through all battletech conventions. The final chapters are especially guilty. A Locust destroyed by a single SRM in the back?. A Hatchetman catches a Locust without the pilot, sorry, MechWarrior even noticing?. Unbelievable.Still, it has a couple of nice moments, which is why I'm giving it two stars and putting it above the Camacho's Caballeros disasters. It's just another book that shows why the BTech novels should have been written by just Stackpole and another 2-3 very selected authors."
1,A real Sun book on Java,"Reading this book is not a very pleasant experience. There are so many typos that I actually stopped reading after 1/3 of the book. I really do not understand how Sun can publish such a book.A little technical note (to justify the title). It does not really teach you great (or even average) insights into EJBs. No real techy info on what the consequences are of using CMP vs BMP (only info from the spec),...It basically is just a rehash of the spec. The examples are for the Sun reference implementation, which would not be that bad if it wasn't half of every chapter (I want to learn EJB not a how to use a reference implementation which is not made for running in production!). All the advantages of EJBs are straight from the Sun EJB marketing book.O yes one plus: it does mention EJB patterns."
4,interesting,"Interesting but still requires some time commitment.Say you're a mom of an young child, then unless you get a nanny or be absolutely sure your baby won't wake up while you do the meditation, this is not for you. It needs protected time. While I did not have anything spectacular happening to me during the sessions, I cannot exclude the possibility that I got some help on a level or another. Also, be sure do not get sucked in the numerous essences and products sold on the website of the author.My philosophy is that,whatever it is ,when it gets expensive, stay away from it.the meditation is free though."
4,A Little Bit of Food and History,"This book is part cookbook and part history book. Scattered thoughout the recipes are historical essays, descriptions, personal accounts, stories and quotes about Tennessee and the Jack Daniel's distillery. These add on bring Tennesse and it's geography and population alive for the reader. Many recipes start with a story of where it came from and how it came into being.I enjoyed finding out how Jack Daniel's distills their whiskey, about how prohibition affected the Daniel's family (they started trading mules), and about how one boarding house is so popular it is still a lunchtime spot that requires reservations. I look forard to giving a try to some of the recipes, many of which call for Jack Daniel's whiskey. Unfortunately none of the recipes include any calorie estimates which I've become used to in cookbooks.[...]"
4,A Great Cookbook,"As someone is who is severely allergic to gluten, wheat, eggs, chicken, beef, soy, and certain types of fish I am forced to change many of the ingredients to fit my diet. While I did enjoyed these recipes I can not say how they taste using the ingredients called for in the book as it has been years since I have tasted many of the ingredients. For example I always substitute flaxseed when eggs are called for in a recipe. A change such as this alters the flavor and texture of the recipe a great deal. That said I enjoy this cookbook and recommend it to those who love good southern cooking."
5,Worth every penny,"I bought this tool for my shop and it has made life so much easier. Removing seals is a complete breeze with this tool. What's nice is that the tip unscrews, so you can reorient it to get at the seal from different angles if you have limited access.Removing seals takes seconds. It works just like the video."
5,Does indeed remove seals easily,We used this seal remover tool on our Acura 03 TL-S timing belt replacement.. it pulled the seals in no tiime once we got the hang of it..now all we need to do is figure out how to put the back cam seal in with the engine in the car.. that should be much easier than removing the cam pulley nut with no timing belt on the engine.. break that bolt lose before removing the belt!!.. we fashioned our own tool to hold the pulley in place while we removed that nut...
4,Does the Job,"If you've lost the custom connector that came with your bag, as I had, this will do. In fact, this was better than my original as it can be set longer, allowing the second bag to ride lower - which makes it have a lower perceived add-on weight.Not a 5 star as it works on the suitcase handles, stressing and stretching that a bit."
3,Didn't work for a purse+carryon,"This is a luggage strap, which i was hoping to use to attached a medium-sized purse to a carry-on. Well, it's too long of a strap, so it didn't work. Nothing wrong with it if you're trying to attach two rolling bags to each other, probably."
4,great looking,with this slick looking coffee maker you will make a great inpression on your kitchen. It is great for those who like to drink coffee in the morning and are always running out. The price was great and shipping was within a week. I would definitely buy another one if I need to for a gift.
4,Review by college student,"Once again, excellent for the college student that's addicted to daily dose of coffee.$15 bucks what more can i say, does it's job almost perfectly.2 small problems that can be overlooked for $15 bucksWhen you pull out the coffe pot, the thing that holds the coffee powder comes out as well.The lid is a tad loose for my liking and tends to open when you are pouring the coffee into the mug.Other than those 2 tiny things, it works great for me."
5,Shuts off automatically just as stated. Safe and energy efficient.,Produces a fast cup of coffee compared with others I have had. Love it for wake up in the morning.
1,"""Can you hear me now?"": I wish.","I read the reviews and chose to believe the good ones. Bad choice.While watching on NetStumbler the product would DECREASE my signal strength each time I increased the power output...even with different antennas, antenna positions and computers.Got it yesterday, sending it back tomorrow.I guess I will move on to creating a wired access point in my attic to get the extra 15 feet of signal reach I needed...but did not even come close to getting from this product."
1,Not compatible with Linksys,The writeup gave no indication that the box can only be used on antennas that screw out of a desktop card - not usable to boost a Linksys router. Totally misleading and disappointing.
2,Extremely minimal improvement,"Like many other reviewers, I am seeing increased signal bars, but almost no improvement in loading speeds. I have the amplifier connected to the router. I am using a TP-Link WR1043ND wireless router which has 3 antennas. I connected the Hawking to the center antenna connection. Initially, I saw absolutely no improvement whatsoever, once I replaced the antenna on the Hawking with the center anrenna I had removed from the TP-Link router, I did notice a very slight improvement, but definitely not enough to justify the expenditure."
3,"Works, but needed to buy a separate adapter","The booster increased the signal strength of my wireless router throughout the house, but I needed to purchase a separate SMA adapter to connect the booster to my Linksys router. I thought the product's advertising was deceptive because it says that it will work with ""most"" routers with detachable antennas, but Linksys is a really common brand. Before you buy you should verify whether you will need an adapter with your modem. Telephone customer support is non-existent."
4,"Works Great, but instructions are weak","Works great on my verizon wifi. But warning the instructions are very weak. When you look at the instructions it makes it look like you plug it into your computers wifi antenna vice the router, but on the box you can see the example of it being attached to the router. But so far my 1 and 2 bar locations in my house are now 4 and 5 bars... netflix and xbox signals seem stronger... haven't played enough to determine if that's improved the performance overall. but the signal strength appears higher."
3,"It's ok, but didn't keep my young reader interested","My 12 yo daughter is a book worm, but for some reason the Leven Thumps series didn't keep her very interested. She read these first two books and then didn't care to read more. She really liked the Fablehaven series, Inkheart series, and the Percy Jackson series. I haven't personally read this book, but I thought she would like it and she didn't."
4,Great Read with a Minor Flaw,"Leven Thumps is quite an intriguing story. It tells the tale of a life of fantasy intertwined into our reality. The plot carries the reader quickly through the pages. The stories of Lev and Winter show how to find a life with meaning and purpose, even in the most dismal of situations. Where the flaw hides is in the character of the protagonists. Their age leaves older readers wanting more connection to the characters. Their actions and words convey their age all too well, and sometimes alienate those past high school. Beyond this minor defect, there is a story that rivals other fantasy. It's a good read."
2,Very Frustrating,"I tried to like this book. I honestly did. My kids and I have been through the Fablehaven series, the Pendragon Series, the Percy Jackson series, the Septimus Heap series, and the Sisters Grimm series. We're not new to the genre, but this book was so tedious. I have had a really hard time getting into this book. Leven is really annoying. His self-doubt is over the top, and I found myself getting tired of it really fast. We finished the book, but we'll be moving on to a different series after this."
5,Leven Thumps And The Gateway To Foo,"It's about a boy named Leven, a girl named Winter, a creature named Clover, and a king/toothpick who save Foo and dreams. I realy liked the book because the auther gave good detail and the ending was realy good. I would recamend the book to anyone who likes books and the Harry Potter series. I would recamend it because it was realy good and had alot of detail. I have long blond hair and one of the main charecters (Winter) had long blond hair."
1,disillusioned,It is full of slime and hatred of parents and authority and mocks goodness and glorifies revenge.
1,Worst Book,"A author should realise this fact that whatever he or she has opinion should be the last thing in his/her book, specially a book like this. But in this case author seems to be already prepare his mind to write -ve thing. I read this book completly and carefully. I am not a Indian nor Pakistani, but being a generalist, I have been to Kashmir many times and seen the incidents where terrorist put the acids on the teenager face. What author expect to do indian government; to watch this happening. They are not left with any option but to keep their army there.You can not give an excuse to terrorism. No matter in what form it is. Killing innocent people is terrorism. This is what happening on the name of jihad there.This book is not worth to read."
5,Morrissey's Poetic Genius at its Finest,"Morrissey's lyrics are absolutely wonderful with unparalleled emotional power. Combined with the music of Johnny Marr, this is truly one of the most sterling recordings in music history."
5,"The Queen is Dead, But The Smiths are Not","Definitely a gem in the Smiths anthology, The Queen is Dead is the album that launched the Smiths to international acclaim in contrast to the relegated cult following they enjoyed in Europe. As many fans of the Smiths, when I first became acquainted with the Smiths, I discovered a band that represented much more than an image or sound. As an alienated youth, Morrissey's whitty and heartfelt lyrics where ones that I readily clung to. Through the music of the Smith's I was able to conjure an image of what it was lke to be British. Perhaps to some residents of the U.K, gestures of national pride and cultural identity might appear to be vulgar or even jingoistic, but if there's anything lacking from music today, it would be the sense of urgeny and passion that a band like The Smiths conveyed to the world. Long live great music and Long live The Smiths."
5,Their Popular Masterpiece,"The Queen Is Dead is the popular choice as The Smiths' masterpiece, and although hardcore fans such as myself could argue in favor of other albums, there is no denying that front to back, this album is their crowning moment and their greatest achievement. Every song is perfect, from the opening attack of The Queen is Dead to the tear-jerking I Know It's Over. The Smiths' greatest song (tied with How Soon Is Now), There is a Light That Never Goes Out, is simply amazing, and this album also contains three slices of perfection in the middle: The Boy With the Thorn In His Side, Cemetry Gates, and the jaw-dropping Bigmouth Strikes Again, perhaps their best single ever. If you are new to The Smiths, get this album and work from here. You will NOT be disappointed."
5,Truly Amazing Music and Lyrics,"The Smiths are my favorite band even though I listen mostly to Old Schol Punk. This is truly remarkable, some songs are really sad like ""There Is A Light That Never Goes Out"" that I admit made me cry during hard depressing times in my teen life. If you are barely geting into The Smiths then you should buy either this album or ""Singles"" so you can hear all of there top good songs. Too bad I dropped and scratched this cd and now I cant hear two songs. But luckly those two songs are on the ""Singles"" cd which I have."
4,smiths strike again,"once agian the smtihs are gold, trust me i hate almost all of the smiths cds and this one is one of the verry best. on ""Frankly Mr.Shankly"" you feel like bobbing your head to the happy beat as morrissey tells mr.frankly off. and on I know its over you can feel the pain of the lyrics so clearly.my favorite on this album is ""Cemetary gates"" which has a happy beat and also some insipreing lyrics of being a teenager and the idea of death and life. and ""Bigmouth strikes agian"" has some powerfull guitar along with the very serious lyrics relating to spousal abuse. but the one of the sweetest most original love song would have to be there is a light that never goes out, the verse,""if a ten ton truck killed the both of us, to die by your side, the pleasure the privilge is mine."" those speak of such a sweet and innocent love that you almost want to just hug morrissey and make him feel all better. but realy thats realy the beauty of his lyr! ics."
1,"Great album, great remaster, but my copy's bunk","I bought this album from a record store, sealed. Open it up, and there's little white specks practically glued to the record on both sides. After cleaning it up, the first cut, The Queen Is Dead, had several pops (popping at the same place every rotation), then a skip! The rest of the side played fine, but when I flipped over to side two, there's a series of pops on Marr's acoustic intro to Bigmouth Strikes Again.I've never had problems with any of the Rhino LP reissues, but apparently I got a bunk record, and to top it off, the store wouldn't exchange it or refund my money. I think I'll hold off on buying the rest of The Smiths vinyl reissues, thanks to getting burned on this one."
5,Feeling better every time I pick up this book!,"Excellent book, from a medical professional who has acturally had the disease. I went to an endocrinologist and told him my thyroid had become inflamed and I was experiencing severe anxiety and he recommended a psychiatrist. The book explained the problem and now I have hope. I told an allergist I was sensitive to salty and sugary foods and he told me to see a psychiatrist. Thank God I found a family practitioner who found my thyroid antibodies where too high and perscribed synthroid which all but eliminated those symptoms.I have had Thyroid disease since I was a teen and at forty three years of age I have never found a better source than the Thyroid Power. Read it and find a good medical or alternative practitioner and begin to travel the road to managed health."
2,only for the novice,I did not find this book helpful for someone who has been medically diagnosed as having true thyroid disease. It is old news. Perhaps can be helpful to someone who suspects they my have a thyroid condition who is just beginning the journey into thyroid disease.
3,Fitness Vidiot,"I love workout videos because I don't have to worry about making up a workout or timing myself, they do it for me. Sometimes you hit the jackpot and sometimes you get an eh workout. While I love the Firm and do them on and off for over 15 years, I wasn't excited with this one. If I had the bar they used for this, it would have been to light. I tried to use a heavier body bar, but it just didn't seem like much of a workout. Jen is a great instructor and has plenty of other Firm videos that are awesome.This workout and most from the sculpting stick set were just eh on workouts and didn't have a WOW factor."
3,"If you like Pro Wrestling, read it.",It's a good book to read if you like Professional Wrestling. You might see what it's really all about and get an indepth view of this world and the family of the Harts.
4,Keeps your skin moisturized,"I first heard of this product a few years ago from a friend who testified that this skin moisturizer was working wonders for her.But, it was only a couple of years ago that I finally got to buy and test the product and I second my friend's opinion. This product works and is great for those who live in cold places and need to constantly use moisturizers. This works great for those tough places like your elbow joint, your feet and hands...often these parts tend to be drier than the rest of the body.Since discovering the product I have boought this product and given it as a gift to my extended family. And their verdict? The same as my friend's and mine...this works!"
1,Do nothing except waste of money,"I heard about this Udderly Smooth from a coworker whose daughter is in diabetic and used these products. I also saw many good reviews about this cream and tried it. It didn't moisturize my hands and felt very watery. I don't expect this as a heavy cream or oily but after severaly weeks of applying to my hands, I threw away all the bottles. I never feel moisturized, not even just after applying this cream. Imagine if you want to use this for your feet....If you are very intersting in these USmooth just because of such great reviews, try a tiny amount from local stores first."
3,WORKS BETTER WHEN MOST OF WATER REMOVED,"Udderly Smooth used to have a better formula. Now it is thinner with more water in it (like most lotions). Water does help moisturize the skin and it's the cheapest ingredient. One way of increasing profits &/or lowering expenses is to add more water. I've called the manufacturer to suggest that they remove some of that water; but, nothing changes. To make any of our lotions thicker, I put an open container, with a thin cloth on it to prevent dust getting in, near a heat vent and let the hot air blow on it for about a month. Some of the water evaporates and some needs to be poured off. Afterwards, we have a thicker lotion or cream that works much better."
1,Wish it was all here!!!,"The cart looks of quality, but I wouldn't know because I cant put it together. Go ahead and ask me, yes all the parts are not here, HUM!! I'm thinking, if you sell something, shouldn't you include all the *#*@*#@# parts? So, it gets better, How do you ask, Let me tell you. I called the manu.... and they told me to fax my reciept in with a list of missing parts, and after two or three days they would process my MISSING PARTS order, not once did they say they were sorry. But, let me tell you that I will never buy from Seville Classics AGAIN!!!!!!!!!! P.S. I'm not bitter, just scorned."
3,Not as expected,"I was disappointed in the quality of the product. Upon final assembly, the three corner poles are level while the fourth could not be lowered to sit evenly. The handle on the cart is not straight and the joint pieces that slip onto the poles are made of plastic which do not snap together and hold. In addition, the wheel locks do not work. I can use the cart, but it doesn't look at all well made and I do not recommend a purchase."
5,Cheese Making Cart!,"I'm a cheesemaker and webmaster for CheeseForum.org and bought this cart to store my cheese making equipment and boxes of soda pop (as cheese press weights) in our laundry room. It is chromed steel, super heavy duty and heavy! Box says holds up to 500 lbs, I put it on families bathroom scales, weight was 21 kg/46 lb! I also bought it at USA Sam's Club.The shelves of the cart are adjustable on 2 inch/5 cm notches on the vertical posts. They are held at a notch by a split medium hard black plastic wedge that goes around the post at the notch and then the steel shelf slides down the column and over the wedge and compresses it in place to fix the shelf. Unit was easy to assemble except top shelf which was fiddly holding the wedges in place while lowering the shelf over them. Comes with hard plastic sheets to stop small items droping through, picture with 3 boxes high of soda below."
5,Rugged reliability,"This is a ruggedly reliable cart. The shelves have a rim around the outside to keep things from sliding off, and no cross-bars to interfere with laying something flat on them. It took about 10 minutes to assemble; use a rubber mallet to lightly tap down the shelves on the clip-on supports. You can position them in 1-inch increments. Even though it's heavy-duty, it's easy to move (good-sized swivel wheels - two of them can lock). I've bought a number of these over the years to use at work and church. They're all still in use, like-new, and always the first ones to be ""appropriated"" by someone looking for a nice cart. The quality is far better than any comparable carts. You won't find this at your local store. Shipping was three days, even though I got it on super-saver!"
5,Sturdy cart. Great price.,"This cart is very well built and the wheels roll smoothly. It was easy to build and assembled in about 15 minutes. I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.Another reviewer had given this cart 3 stars a year or two ago because of the high price and shipping cost. When I was ordering, the default option was to buy the cart from ""Stacks and Stacks"" for $88 plus $20 shipping. I don't know if Amazon just recently started carrying it but they sell it for $60 with FREE super saver shipping. This might be a mistake because the cart is 47 lbs, but I received the cart for $65 (tax included) shipped to me in about 3 weeks. The invoice said I saved $26 in shipping costs."
5,Seville Classics All Purpose Utility Cart SHE18304,"Excellent product for the price. People try to sell these for $250 on Craigslist. I paid in the $60 range...Easy to assemble, and smooth operation of the casters. Just what I needed for some of my kitchen implements."
1,not measured correctly!,this cart would be wonderful if it was actually the size it says it is. it was bought for a 60 pound portable dishwasher that is 17.75 in wide. the stats and box say this cart is 18in wide but it IS NOT! its only 17.5 making it too small for our dishwasher due to the raised sides. i also cannot return it now because i opened the box... not happy.
5,Great jazz arrangements.,"This is one of those times when I'm glad I didn't read the reviews first. While I respect the opinions of the other reviewers, it seems to me that it is perhaps a matter of whose cup of tea this is.The wonderful Jackie brings much to this collection of songs. First, her voice--and enough said there. Second, her sense of humor. Third, her versatility and musicianship--put to good use here. Fourth, her very early experience singing popular music. There is much more, but let's stop at that.Jackie's guys are also wonderful. The ensembles were terrific fun, especially ""Would You Like To Swing On A Star"", on which the swinging is in full swing! Delightful jazz arrangements throughout."
1,PSYCHOLOGICAL DOODOO,"I saw Ripper I and don't remember a whole lot about it, so in going into RIPPER 2, I was a little leary about what to expect. If you haven't seen the first Ripper, this one will probably be confusing anyway. A different actress takes over the role of Molly and there's so much plot twisting and lack of cohesion that this movie is merely a dull waste of time. The trend of overabundant lesbian sex is once again used as padding and the murders are staged so haphazardly no terror is induced. The acting by all is really pretty bad. Let's hope we don't have a RIPPER 3, although its ambiguous ending suggests we might be burdened with it. This reviewer will not go for a third run though!"
3,Terminally Solid Read,"Though I personally thought this novel wasn't as good as Keene's zombie duology, it was still a most interesting and riveting tale.The last 1/3 of the book kinda lost its steam for me. Not bad, just not as great and explosive as it could have been. Very character driven, though. I look forward to Keene's new novel."
2,Boot,"Yes it's a Giorgio Brutini, but the quality of the leather is very poor and cheap looking. I am not satisfied with this product and the shoe gets very uncomfortable as the work day draws near. Needless to say I was very disappointed in this purchase."
1,A ripoff,"This book was wss pitched along with other books by the real Robert B. Parker, the final books after his death. When I got it I found out it was a potboiler about the CIA, and written by some other Robert B. Parker. I've been a Spenser fan since the beginning, and one would think that this book would have come up in all the searches I've done over the years. I have to conclude that it was dragged out of bad-book limbo to take advantage of the real Parker's passing."
2,Disappointed,I bought this with the stroller and an additional base for our 2nd car. Very expensive and already our 4.5 mo old is outgrown it. The fabric is not breathable either and she sweats a lot in it. The hood is also very short and does not give much coverage on the carseat...it's also very heavy and not very easy to load and unload in the car. One other thing...I've noticed other mommies can rock their babies in their carseat but this one does not rock very well at all.
1,Sturdy but too heavy......,"I bought this because I got the primo viaggio stroller. WRONG idea, just because it matches, I should have been smarter than that! My baby gets very cranky in it, it sits up too high, so her head gets stuck forward while I am driving which is very alarming and the baby wakes up pretty upset, making choking noises. The only thing I like is how tough it seems, and when she's already sleeping, and we're shopping, I don't have to pull her out of the car seat-I just snap it into her stroller and she's pretty good from there.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, there are a ton more with better features!"
3,Depending on what you're looking for...,"This type of ""compilation"", where many artists play one track is often hard to rate.In this case, it starts off with all the nergy and power of sax player Everette Harp. This man is pure energy. Track number 2 is a fantastic one with Bobby Lyle playing a very Crusader like ""Southern Wind"". Up to now, we're in extasy. Then (o-oooooH !) comes a normal cut. Then comes the track ""I hear angels"", a marvelous slow song, magnificently performed by Tim Owens, Tom Scott, and Byron Miller. Jump to track number 6 and listen to a song that could be a typical Phil Perry one. Delicious ! And of course, Mister Joe sample, with ""Jungle Walk"". Another chef d'oeuvre.So why only 3 stars ? well, because the other tracks aren't really worth it. So, depending on what you're looking for and how you measure things, it can be a four star, or a two star cd. Let's go for compromise then ! Maybe that is why the album is called double scale."
4,Works just fine,"I was having problems with skype using my previous webcam, but did not have any trouble with this one. It is small and nice-looking, but I wish we could turn the lens sideways, not just up and down. Also, I was expecting a better video capture quality, but it is ok. Beware, the software that comes with it may significantly slow your computer down."
1,Logitech Quickcam Defective,I am very unhappy with my purchase of the Logitech Quickcam Deluxe for Notebooks from Amazon.com. I think they sent out a defective product as the picture is completely out of focus and the sound is barely audible. I had to return the product due to the inability to get it to work properly.
4,One cool webcam,"Easy to setup , low light is awesome, face tracker is just great.overall awesome webcam for the price."
4,Great buy,Great product.Better than average picture but doesn't do that well in low light situations. Nice and portable and comes with it's own little case. Good buy for using on Skype.
4,"Decent camera, works with Linux 2.6","I'm happy to share that this camera appears to have good v4l2 support. Some applications cannot use it for some reason, and can even lock it up (just unplug and reinsert) but the applications that do work (such as Motion) read images from it for days without problems! The ""clip"" isn't large enough to clip to a desktop LCD, but works great with my laptop (the intended use). Manual focus, short cable, are to be expected from a laptop camera, but the included carrying case was a nice surprise."
2,Poor driver software and outdoor images saturated,"I have had this camera for a few months now, and I'm really quite disappointed by Logitech.First of all, the driver software is poorly written: it is huge (35 MBytes!) and unstable -- it crashes easily, and kills the computer (blue screen of death).Next, the image quality is great indoors, but outdoors everything is saturated. I tried to adjust everything, contacted customer support, sent them photos taken with the camera, but nobody seems to be able to help.I give it just a little more than 1 star because when it does happen to work, it works nicely."
5,Insightful,"This was chosen for a parenting book club read. I'm only 30 pages into it, but it's 30 are like another book's 100. Every paragraph has something insightful worth stopping to reflect on. Within the first 30 pages it's not at all a How-To guide to parenting but rather discussion on psychological topics that effect who we as adults are, and how our personality connects with the child (or can disconnect). Wonderful wonderful!"
5,His love always finds you,"I Love this book, I have read it several times and have given it to friends. If you want a book ti help you see Jesus more clearly, this book will. I highly recommend it. Miki"
5,tuning with ease,"I tuned my whole piano with ease. On the very low and high notes , I had to unplug the wired mike (purchased separately) and just used the built in one. I am very satisfied with this product.Bob"
4,Good product at a great price,Very easy to use and very accurate. A must have when building and tuning Native American Flutes.I would rate it 5 stars if it had a built in thermometer for concert tuning at 72 degrees.
3,great tuner! but is not a peterson!!! beware,I have experienced to use a peterson tuners app in my iPad & iPhone.if you are in a guitar tech business go with peterson tuners because the korg is a good tuner but is not as precise as peterson. and accuracy is vital when you set up a guitar!!!! and peterson do the job very well
5,tuner,Quick delivery and in perfect condition. Product also seems well made. Would buy from seller again.
4,works great!,"It does the job. The flip stand is flimsy, I wish they had made it wider and more heavier. Wish its more stable when standing. Otherwise it's a good product. It does the job and accurate."
3,Easy to use but fragile,"These korg tuners are inexpensive, accurate and very easy to use, but their construction is pretty cheap. I would avoid slamming them around in a gig bag, for instance. They work better than phone app tuners, in my opinion. They seem to last a little longer than competitors' models, but for the price, buy 2 so you have a backup. We have used them for guitar and autoharp tuning, but you can also check vocal pitch."
1,Useless for what I needed,"I needed this to tell me voice frequency in Hz. It doesn't. The little 440 Hz in the corner is just some calibration tool, not the actual frequency of the noise coming in. Doesn't indicate octave either, so you can't convert from a note back to a frequency. Total waste of my money. Threw it away because I don't need the clutter and I can't imagine anyone else ever wanting it."
5,Outstanding bible of kitsch,"Cool whip, Polynesian cuisine, poodles, enormous breasts. Everything that made America great, right in this here book. Absolutely the best Americana book I've ever read; everything lovingly researched and dissected with wit and sensitivity. Where else can you find out about the semiotics of velvet paintings? Too bad that Jane and Michael Stern's book is out of print; if you can find it, buy it."
5,Great book and great service! Kia Ora!,This is a good source of color photos dealing with beautiful Maori arts. It is out of date and obviously made for the pakiha tourists but nevertheless a good source.
5,I like it,"I think Van Cliburn and the Moscow Philharmonic orchestra do a fine job with the Rachmaninoff. Cliburn is a great interpreter of Rachmaninoff, and it shows here.As for the Brahms, it is an amazing performance, especially given that it is live."
5,Awesome physics review.,"Explained everything to me clearly. Did so much more then my prof. at Berkeley. I was alone and scared in the dark, but with the guidance of Mr. Elby, I was able to see the light. ANDREW ELBY IS MY HERO!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Floating Girl Soars,"As a mystery author who writes novels with a multicultural backdrop, I genuinely admire Sujata Massey's Rei Shimura novels. As an American of Japanese heritage living in Tokyo, Rei provides unique insights into both cultures. In FLOATING GIRL, Massey weaves many subplots together while focusing on the Japanese fascination with animation--manga. A man Rei meets is murdered, and a manga artist may hold the solution to the crime. With FLOATING GIRL, Massey continues to take giant strides forward as a writer--braving new frontiers in her mystery sub-genre. FLOATING GIRL is a solid effort, and I recommend it highly."
3,Trying too hard to please,Every time I read one of this series I swear I'll forgo the next one. A Japanese-American trying to be more Japanese than the Japanese gets a little old after the fourth or fifth book. But... I'm usually standing in line for the next one. I'd like it if she quit trying so hard or went back to the States where she was raised (she has) and settled down to selling Japanese artifacts and sleuthing.
3,Still interesting,"I enjoy reading about Rei's travails as she wades through one complication after another. Massey does not seem to want to keep one solid supporting cast, though, and that is disappointing to me as I LOVE Aunt Nori and her son. Ms. Massey's books are always interesting to read because of the cultural knowledge the reader will pick up. I enjoy reading her, although I don't think some of the scenarios are remotely possible."
4,Fun reading sparks new ideas,"This book is fun to read and sparked many ideas for me, an occasionally industrious but remarkably un-creative gardener. Down to earth and practical."
2,NOT THE FIEDLER I REMEMBER,"Against the 5 star rating reviews for this collection. I tread with a measure of trepidation with a 2 star rating. Yes I followed Fiedler for many many years, and enjoyed his interpretations with the Boston Pops as early as the 1940's. and followed the Boston Pops into the 1950's. Sadly, something has changed, I DID NOT enjoy these recordings, yes there were a few exceptions, but on the whole I was very disappointed,these recordings failed the ""goose-pimple"" test. The transfer from the originals was not a success."
4,Duluth Shipping News Hits The Mark,"This video is a must-have for anyone who is a true fan of the Duluth, Minnesota area and the journey of the Great Lakes boats. A month-by-month journey with hundreds of photographs and 6 videos will give you the boat fix you need and will be something to enjoy many times over."
3,Did not work for me,"I am not going to say that this is not a good product given the positive reviews but it definitely is not a good product for me. I was so excited to get this and try it as I am always looking for a good 'anti aging' skin cream and the reviews sounded great with a product that was very affordable to boot.Within a couple of days my pretty much clear (and I am 51) complexion was just a mess. I not only broke out but had a strange blotchiness that never seemed to go away. I started using the cream again as I have it here but only on my neck. Too bad though.So my 3 star rating is not so much for the product but for what I experienced it myself using it. All aside, the item arrived quickly and it is always a breeze ordering from here."
1,Eucerin Sensitive Facial skin Q10 Anti Wrinkle,"I've come to the conclusion if the product is advertised as Anti-Wrinkle it ain't going to work and more than likelydo nothing but lay on your skin like a mast.Olay Regenerist is the same way it actually feels like heat on your skin. This one doesnt feel like that, it just feels like you are wearing a mask and the pores in your face are clogged.After seeing the horrors of plastic surgery and the Contour debacle where threads are inserted into your skin to pull the face up... frankly just face the fact your never going to look like your were even in your 40's.Time and nature will have their way with you. Matter of a fact if wrinkles are all you have got, be glad there are so many ills and deseases to confront you as you make this short journey in your life, just be yourself."
1,Very misleading title,"""Hate RV's, Concrete Slabs""? Every one of these campgrounds have RV hookups and most have concrete pads. What the heck? I was expecting to find some cool remote places to camp in this book. All the ones in this book are very generic, state park, pay sites. Don't buy, you can find all these campgrounds very easily online (NC State Park website). The only hope with this book is to give some general advice on an area, then finding something good online or by just exploring."
5,Showing love to others = less concern about yourself,This book is wonderful! It talks about giving love and service to others and when you do that - you feel better about yourself. My sister read it as well and said it was the best thing for her. Totally what she needed to read! I highly recommend it!!! A great read!
4,a quiet cd that will grow for you,"Pleasant Grove feels like a band that is playing each song for you in your own room. The music is quiet and reflective in many cases, but has an intimacy and depth that become apparent after several listenings. Some of the songs have a more traditional pop feel(elaborate son, tug of war), but many of the rest feel initially like the band has slowed things down more than they should. However, after learning all the songs, they become rich with the layered electric guitars and quietly sung vocals, and you will find yourself singing along to them all."
5,yet another beautiful painting,"by a beautiful band. if you don't have their album ""auscultation of the heart"" (hard to find, nowadays) and you happen to run across one, do not hesitate.""tug of war"" is the best song of 2004.""only a mountain"" was the best song of 2003.""calculated approaches"" and ""commander whatever"" are amazing pieces of work.people just don't write songs like this band does. don't let the quiet charm fool you. this band rocks very hard, with an intensity that just grabs you and swallows you up.http://www.pleasantgrovemusic.com"
1,High Spot in the Middle,This skillet has a high spot in the middle. The cooking oil runs to the sides. I returned it.
5,Easy to clean up,"I've owned electric skillets before and it was always so difficult to clean up that we put them away and only pulled them out for big occasions. We bought this skillet a month ago and use it several times a week. We haven't had any problems with it at all, and we love the way you can pull the pan off for easy clean up."
2,Heats great Teflon come off,The overall concept of a detachable cooking element is good for ease of cleaning. The temperature control is nice. The beep when it reaches the selected temperature is a bit loud since it sounds like the smoke detector. I am going to have to send this back and re-think the purchase since the teflon comes off so easily. Teflon is not in my diet.
1,Really disappointed - I expected more from Rival,"Uneven heat, slow to heat up, hard to clean - all in all a big disappointment. It stopped working within 2 months and I returned it."
3,Here is a o.k book,The book was o.k it wasn't what i thought it was giong to be if you haven't wached the moive yet you should watch yet you should wactch it first to get a better understanding of it.
4,Despite the errors and interesting theory,"Although there were some editorial mistakes this book had greatredeeming value. There was a good amount of evidence to supportHanson's views and although they were one-sided, they proved fascinating. He provides decisive evidence of the lack of appreciation for some of our most influential leaders of all time. A good read for those wanting to learn more about three leaders from different times who are alike in many ways."
4,Thought-provoking historical comparisons of exceptional military leaders:,"A treatise on wars fought over the centuries, and what makes for leadership for victory, keeping casualties on both sides as low as possible. Victor Davis Hanson uses his great knowledge of Greek culture to springboard into comparisons with Civil War General Sherman, and World War II General Patton and their philosophies.This book will make you rethink a lot of your conceptions of World War II and the Civil War, and the contributions Gen. Sherman and Gen. Patton made to final victory."
2,"Nothing against the trainer, just too much choreography","My usual style of workout video is Jillian Michaels or Jackie Warner. I'm in good shape, work out 5-6 days a week and I like a challenge. I like a no-nonsense, no frills workout dvd that I can get an effective sweaty workout with the first time I do it. And I like simple kickboxing. For this video, you have to learn some complex choreography in order to do the moves. I believe there IS a training section where they teach the moves. But I don't want to have to prepare BEFORE I do the workout. I attempted to do the workout without the ""Pre"" workout prep and I'm decently coordinated, but I couldn't follow a lot of it, and I barely broke a sweat. I was just frustrated and gave up and popped in a different DVD that I knew would get my heart rate up. Now, bear in mind, if you like the choreographed sort of thing, you may love this. I did not."
2,No era lo que esperaba,"El lenguaje es demasiado sencillo y muy general, poca informacion o en otras palabras lo que dice es lo que generalmente se conoce mediantes los familiares y amigos, realmente no tiene nada eespecial."
1,Not good,I think it's pretty but not made well. The hole is to small to clean it. The birds love it but it is too shallow so every time the wind blows it goes every where. I have it sitting on a table so it doesn't leak but the birds won't use it there.
2,No Way,"Precious got a flowering plant with big red flowers. One day she saw a hummingbird. So I figured I'd get a feeder to attract more humming birds. I got this.It's great. I put it out there. It doesn't leak. The birds chow down on it like nobody's business. Precious enjoyed watching the birds.But here we are about six months later. The thing is rusted. The weather has taken its toll on the thing, and it just looks awful. I'll have to get something else next spring."
1,VERY UNHAPPY,"I ordered the feeder pictured above. The company sent me a totally different one. They said that it was Amazons fault, they had the wrong picture. Then they said they don't carry the one pictured. WASSUP???"
3,Service is a Problem,"Loved the monitor and used it at every workout. However, when the battery waned and I went to the retailer for replacement, I discovered it needed to be mailed in to Polar for servicing. More than a bit of an inconvenience. Would be an ENORMOUS improvement if basic maintenance could be handled without the hassle and delay of shipping."
5,How To Control Children & Retain Their Respect,"""Back To Basics Discipline"" is the best book I have ever read about successful parenting. A step by step method is furnished that any parent can understand and apply to raising their own children. The noteworthy work will open the eyes of many parents about instilling self-control, honesty, and respect in their offspring. The book is a totally complete guide for creating a positive home environment blossoming with love and respect. This is a must-read for parents desiring their children to be controlled in a loving environment and growing up to be good citizens."
4,"Good Product, Bad Handling","I ordered this product Sept 29, received it Oct 5 with normal shipping which was good. When I received the product, the string to which the charm hangs down from was broken so I had to go through the tedious process of getting the tiny little string through the tiny little hole and tying a tiny little knot.Pros:- Good Product Quality- Nice Looking- Got What I WantedCons:- Broken On Arrival (Although easily fixed, there should have been ""no assembly required"")Overall, my experience was fine with a minor inconvience, in the end, I would probably buy from them again. In the future, please be more carefully when you ship!"
4,"Easy to make coffee, easy to clean up","My wife bought me this coffee maker for Christmas. So I have been using my Procotor-Silex coffee maker for about 4 months. There are two features I particular like with this unit. First, the water resevoir is removable so you can add water easily and accurately. Second, the cup that holds the coffee filter is removable so you can easily clean it.The timer feature has worked fine the few times I've used it. But to be honest I mostly appreciate the timer as a clock. I have made it to work on time on more then a few occasions courtesy of this feature.If there is one feature I dislike, it is that the lid to the carafe is not removable and so cleaning it in the dish washer is a bit tricky.Overall, this is a quiet, reliable coffee maker. I would buy a second one if the need arose."
2,Not worthy of Candlemass,"While I like many other Candlemass CDs, this one is not worth it. Unless you are a Candlemass collector and need to get everything from them (like me), skip this and get ""As it is"", ""King of the grey island"", or ""Ancient Dreams""."
1,Rip-Off!,"Judging by the price, I assumed I was getting a full-size (12-ounce) bottle. Surprise! It's only 4 ounces. I paid full price and got 1/3 the value I was expecting. Try another vendor; I'm surprised Amazon does business with this one."
3,Photo printer,"Great little printer, a little expensive for thermal print supplies and special paper to print on. Hard to find supplies"
2,Disappointing !!!,"Boyz II Men was one of my favorite groups of all time. But this new CD really disappointed me. You have to give it to them, they tried to create something on their own. BUT THERE IS STILL A LONG WAY BEFORE THEY BECOME PRODUCERS OR COMPOSERS. They are great singers, no doubt about it but they are not musicians at all. This is your average R&B album, Boyz II Men don't stand in the crowd. On top of that, they are playing some ""bad guys"" image, which is not them!!! I'd rather stick with Evolution, even if it was not the best of their work."
3,It's okay,This cd doesn't do much for me and I happen to be a big Boyz II Men fan. There are no songs on it that you see people running out to get the single. Not saying that the cd's bad but the songs are all rather...done before. There's nothing special about them. The regular Boyz II Men spark isn't there.
5,Most impressive book on the subject,"All I can say is fascinating, in depth and very stimulating. I'm really glad I stummbled across this gem."
3,nice!,"I like the way Tatiana Nikolaeva plays Shostakovich preludes. Some of the tempos are much slower then I am used to hearing, but she is thinking thought it as she plays. I wonder how she played it when she was a young women."
1,Do not be deceived by this title,"Contrary to appearances, this book has nothing to do with any of Tim Gallwey's Inner Game books including The Inner Game of Tennis, The Inner Game of Golf, The Inner Game of Music or the upcoming The Inner Game of Work. The authors' use of this title is perhaps intentionally designed to decieve readers, and suggests an interesting if not questionable definition of the word 'entrepreneuring'."
2,"Too predictable, each chapter as almost the same .",I was dissapointed with this one as it was so predicatble and the dialogue repetitive. I may have ben looking for something diferent as I have really enjoyed all of Clancy's other books.
2,The problem is: It is US invading,"Remember the South China Sea is belong to China, hence the logic become problematic"
1,Clancy hits the bottom,"Tom Clancy's ""SSN"" is without a doubt the worst drivel I've ever read! One nuclear submarine takes on the entire Chinese navy - including a couple Russian driven subs - an takes them all out... I've enjoyed Clancy's books since I first read ""Red Storm Rising"". The first time I felt Clancy wrote too many books was when I read ""OP-centre"". That book, and the sequels, feels like Clancy's trying to get money out of his name. ""SSN"" just made me shiver with embarrassement for him. The plot is allright, but the story's probably written on a VERY bad day. when Clancy writes books about espionage (and ""Red Storm..) he's one of the best writers in the world! But here he's missed big time!"
1,Very Disappointing,"I am a self admitted Tom Clancy junkie and had read all of his books, with SSN being the sole remaining piece. I am quite frankly having a difficult time believing that Tom Clancy actually wrote this book. While there are some very fascinating peeks into the inner workings of a submarine, the book is repetitive to the point of boring, has unrealistic and not believable fiction. Each of the battle sequences seems to be the exact same, with minor variations. The fiction regarding the location of the legal Chinese PM, the response of the Chinese people to the naval conflicts, and the method of transportation for the Chinese PM back to resolve the conflict are down right silly. Unless you really really really want to know some random facts about how a Submarine works, I would advise avoiding this book."
3,"Good audiobook, bad for reading","I love Clancy's writing, and so while going on a long road trip a while back, I bought the audio version. Excellent entertainment on the trip and fun to listen to. I plan to get the CD and download it to the iPod to carry around for the same purpose. But for reading, I can probably see why many on this site rate it as they do. I read for depth. And deep this ain't. As far as reading goes, if you want a great Clancy novel which takes you through sub warfare, I strongly recommend Hunt for Red October and Red Storm Rising. If you want to have a fun yarn while on a road trip, the audio verion is worth it."
1,The Worst Book I've Read in 20 Years - Complete Trash!,"Oh my gosh, who wrote this trash? Surely not Clancy! This is what I would have written in 7th grade. Team USA scores again! Plot? Character development? What's that? Where do I write to get my money back? Who will reimburse me for the 3 hrs I flushed down the toilet trying to find a plot? I'm flabbergasted! I'm flummoxed! I'm incredulous! I never thought I'd find a bad Clancy novel. Now I've seen (read) everything. Take a looooong vacation Tom. You obviously need it.p.s. I've read the messages explaining that this novel is background material for the CD-ROM game. That's fine, but someone should have slapped a sticker on the cover identifying it as ""totally boring and moronic - a complete waste of time and money for the PC game enthusiast"""
1,Very lazily written,"First of all, I didn't realize that the book was based on a video game...a recipe for disaster. Don't buy the book, not even close to par for Clancy....."
2,BORING!,"This book disapointed me. Notice how in the book the Chinise lost thousands of lives and ships and America lost none? Also everytime a missile was about to be fired you will her this(And trust me you will hear it a lot)""Tubes one and two ready. Tubes one and two fired electrity. Cut the wires and shut the outer doors. And also the American noisemakers ALWAYS worked and the Chinise noisemakers hardly ever worked! I will dissapointed if this is all that Clancy has instore for his readers anymore."
1,"WINDOWS 95 ""ONLY""","Looks like a game I'd try out, only problem is: Unless you are in the age of dinasours you cant. This game operates on Windows 95 ""Only"""
1,Nearly turned me away from reading altogether!,"I am sorry to have to write this about one of Tom Clancy's books, but I must.The book is so UNREALISTIC. The situations that it is in are so untruthful. If these were to actually happen, the Cheyenne would have died before I stopped reading it, aroud page one-hundred. It can meet up with any number of submarines and attack, kill and defeat EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM!I am sorry Mr. Clancy but this book, is a definate FLOP compared to your others, in my personal opinion."
1,This was a book?,"Nothing but a long repetitive string of cliches and utterly stupid commands like ""Navigator, plot a course to take us to starboard of the Spratley Islands."" Clancy, never really much of a writer beyond technocratic jargon, has become very, very lazy. The idea for this novel (war with China) had lots of promise, more than ""Red Star Rising"", but it wasn't developed much beyond a poorly written and sketchy outline. Don't waste your money."
1,BOOOORING!,"About as interesting and exciting as a boxing match between Mike Tyson and George Burns. ""Hey Mack there are some ships over there lets go sink them. Great job we sunk them. U-oh! here come some submarines lets sink them too. Great job, we sunk them too. Lets go get some more torpedos and do it again."" You have just read the entire book so there is no need to buy it now."
1,Too much technical detail and jargon,This was the most disappointing Clancy work I have read. The flow was broken by too much incomprehensible technical jargon. The sentence structure was choppy; poor transition.
3,Unbelievable,I've just finished the book and I find it hard to absorb the details. The action was fine but its just that some of the subs like the akula and alfa were supposed to be some of the best around. The way they went down so easily were kind of hard to take.
5,That Cheyenne is one BAAAAAAAAAAD mother...,"C'mon, folks, give this book a break. Yes, it stinks, but I think it stinks in a ""Showgirls"" way...so bad it's funny.What's not to like about a book that repeats the line ""Tube one ready in all respects"" about 112,097 times?Think of the Cheyenne as the Superfly TNT of submarines and you'll like it."
3,Typical Clancy,"What I like most about this story is Clancy does not go into the usual detail, for example how to build a submarie piece by piece. Otherwise a typical Clancy novel."
2,Yet Again USA USA USA USA,"It never ceases to amaze me how Tom Clancy can continue to write with one aim in mind..... to promote the United States. The book is simply about a series of Chino-American submarine engagements. There are some political factors thrown into the mix for good fortune as well but the storyline is very thin. Once again the American submarine defeated all enemy vessels with ease. This is never the case in submarine warfare from which I can speak with active and professional experience. Don't expect anything enthralling once you open that cover.... you'd be better trying another from his range such as ""The Hunt For Red October"". This book was still too pro-USA but at least was well written and an entertaining read."
4,lots of action,"This will keep you reading. I don't finish many books but this book quickly paints the lives of its characters keeping my interest up. It has suspense, mystery and enough sex to get your imagination going."
3,A little disappointed,"When you first look at this cd, it looks as if it could be outstanding. My guess is that each artist was given only a small amount of time (or took too little time) to prepare for this recording. The arrangements are...interesting at best and the performances are a little lack-luster. I am a major Bernstein fan and an even larger West Side Story fan (my daughter's name is Maria) and I walked away from this cd wanting to listen to the original to cleanse my palate. The one track that is worth listening to is Cool. It is a great arrangement and is the bright spot for this recording. I wondered why I had never heard of this...now I know."
5,A perfect marriage of tradition and modern,The voice of Sinead O'Connor on Foggy Dew is incredibly haunting and beautiful. Rocky Road to Dublin with the Rolling Stones is joyous rollicking music. Sting's singing on the opening track is wonderful. Change in your Demeanor is my favorite track on the CD. The blend of rock/pop stars with traditional Irish music as played by the chieftains works so well on this CD. I have given this cd as a gift to many of my friends. I couldn't imagine St. Patrick's day without this one.
4,With a little help from their friends!,"Sting, Mick Jagger, Van Morrison. Just a few of the guests on this Chieftains' CD. Good performances are found throughout the CD, particularly Sinead O'Connor's ""Foggy Dew"" and Ry Cooder's version of ""Coast of Malabar"". Some misfires like Jagger's blase take on the title cut and Tom Jones' overwrought ""Tennessee Waltz"" are easily excused by the quality of the rest of the disc. Some people had a problem with the idea of the Chieftains ""selling out"" but as long as the quality is there I don't understand the problem with the Chieftains attempting to make a CD that might prove to have more commercial viability. The more people introduced to their music the better."
4,Quick and informative read.,Very straight forward and easy to understand. Information can easily and quickly be adopted into your working experience with others.
1,Totally useless,This thing is awful. The thing has a low volume and if barely fits the ear.It hurts and the god awful mic is so short it is annoying.
1,Garbage,The cord shorts out after only a few months. Avoid this product! I would have been happy to pay more for a better quality product.
1,Short life - very disappointing,"Both the original and a replacement lasted less than a year. Horrible. I'm tossing the cordless and buying a corded one.There is something wierd about the reviews here. Several saying it doesn't last long, some that say the fit was poor, and then several glowing reviews about how great they are and how wonderul the fit is.I don't care about the fit, but I do care about spending $20 a year for new batteries. Do research and make an educated decision before you purchase."
1,Was Sent Wrong Item!,"Instead of being sent the item I ordered, I was sent a pink horizontal holster. I never recieved the ""Brand New Motorola Razr LCD Cradle Twin Desktop Battery Charger + AC Adapter"" so I can't write a review on it. I will say, however, that I am dissapointed. For one thing, I'm a guy; I would NEVER order a PINK holster for my phone. ""Not that there's anything wrong with that."" I find it hard to believe that Amazon.com got this order whacked. I decided not to send the holster back. Too much of a hasssle. I also decided that I'll just have to learn to live without the Desktop Charger. And so it goes. ;)"
4,Good product!,"Product did what it was designed to do. We used it to protect the thin glass on our wall partitions in our office. Also, it is also kind of reflective like a mirror. I would definitely purchase it again."
2,Not Frizz Free,"I was unimpressed. The plates did not close down enough to remove all of the frizz from my ends. I have naturally curly hair, not too thick...like medium and my coils are medium. I had to have made at least 6 or 7 passes before I just decided to take it back. I will say this, the plates and the glide were super smooth - that was a good thing about it; and it also heated up as fast as all other flat irons i've had. However, it also did not have a swivel cord which wasn't something I was thrilled to discover."
3,Didn't last long,When I first got this flat iron 6 months ago I loved it. It straightened my hair great and heated up quickly. But it died over the weekend and won't heat up. I'm disappointed this flat iron didn't even last 6 months.
1,Babyliss Pro BAB2490,"Took 9 days to receive. Hate it. While it straightens your hair it leaves it looking frizzy. If you leave the comb on, it pulls your hair out. If you remove the comb, it pulls your hair out where the comb was. Makes your hair looked very fried. I will go back to CHI."
1,Disappointed,"I bought 1 Babyliss Porcelain Ceramic 1 1/2"" Flat Iron BAB2590, but the product doesn't work properly. It smells burned and while I am using it, it starts to get cold. Then I have to stop using it for a few minutes and wait it get hot again.With all this problems if I want to return the product I had to pay the shipping.I'm really disappointed."
5,Babyliss Ceramic Straitener,I have enjoyed using this. It heats up super fast and staightens very well. I like the small shape of it. It fits well in your hand and is nice and light so it does not seem like a chore to straighten your hair. It seems quality and I am hoping it will last a long time!
5,Love this Flat Iron,"I've been searching for a flat iron with a built-in comb for years after having one 5 years ago, and this one is perfect. It's not too big or long, easy to pack for travel; has adjustable heat which is perfect for multiple users; and having the built-in comb makes straightening quick and easy! It's so nice not having to rely on a brush to run thru your hair in front of the iron, just a quick swipe of the iron & that's it!! Love it, Love it, Love it!!!"
2,"Sickly Sweet, No Depth","This book was solidly mediocre. Character development was not great. The lead heroine was too upbeat and hopeful, and it was hard to believe she fell in love with her hero so fast. The ""hero"" of this story was unpleasant and unlikable, with few redeeming qualities. It was tough to root for him, or for them as a couple. Not much action or intrigue, but okay if you like sickly sweet heroines who have no problem pining after their man and enduring ridicule as a silent martyr. The plot attempts to get the heroine caught up in ludicrous consequences of poorly controlled magic, but scenes were nowhere close to laugh-out-loud funny. There are a few good romantic moments, but they don't make the book worth reading. At only $0.99, I won't say it's a waste of money, but there are certainly better books out there."
2,ok,"There was a lot of dragging in this book. It was like the beginning was exciting, were there was action after action and then the middle was all fluff. In the end, I just finished the book for the sake of finishing it. Nothing amazing about it - and I wont read it again."
4,Extremely likable characters,I found Joy to be a really endearing and likable character. I think the plot was pretty solid. It was cute and funny and the attraction between Joy & Alec seemed real and enjoyable to read about.
2,slow,Didn't even finish book because the story line moves so slow. Gave it a 2 because i remember when first started reading romance novels i would've found it appealing .
5,Give it a whirl,"I loved this book and would totally recommend it to any one who enjoyed books about magic and romance and relationships that shouldn't really work out but do because someone has an epiphany. Also, some of the moments in this book were pure comedy and I found myself laughing out loud."
3,"Average Romance, but funny circumstances!","The book reminds me of the TV series 'Bewitched', but Joy is a little 'too happy' for me sometimes. It is a little hard to believe that she would fall in love so quickly without knowing Alec at all. Although usually I enjoy a funny romance, I find Joy to be a little spinless and silly."
2,Disappointing,"I got this based on 2 other reviews. I must have misread them because this book only contains the lyrics, chord structure and melody. It does not have any of Knopfler's riffs, solos, etc. So if you are looking for some guidance on playing these songs on guitar like Mr. Knopfler, look elsewhere. If you want a book with the lyrics for singing or for playing accompanyment, it is okay."
1,Nikon D200 pro user | one of two bought bats bad,"I bought two batteries for my D200 few weeks ago. I always use the power grip. One of the batteries drains so fast that the camera begin to loose the power for about 1 second showing the battery is dead. I charge both batteries and swap the positioning periodically to apply share usage, but the one i marked ""L"" (Left) does not hold for two long. I use SB-800 so I don;t need much power consumption to the flesh.Good part: if i can return/exchange it, I would buy more for the price."
4,Very cute,"I got this for my 14 yr old sons 1st girlfriends birthday present, and was surprised at how nice it was for the price. I want one of my own, and I am pretty picky when it comes to jewelry for myself."
3,Just ok...,"I agree with the other reviewers that the blankets are far too overfilled to be usable. My daughters get really frustrated trying to lie their dolls on the beds only to have them roll right off... Kind of defeats the purpose of a bedroom set for them to play with. The beds are also a tight fit for the wooden dolls we have by Plan Toys. The little accessories are cute and the beds themselves are well made. But they are nothing special. And with the bedding frustration, I wish we had gotten Educo or Plan Toys bunk beds instead."
2,Not impressed,"I was not expecting much. Mostly decided on the keyboard because of the number pad and 2 USB ports. I wanted to replace my Mac's original keyboard which didn't have a number pad. The problem appeared when I tried to plug in my iPod. There was insufficient power to charge/load it. Also, I have a card reader that needs power. Can't run that either. I won't return it as the trouble wouldn't be worth the refund less shipping. My husband thinks these are USB 1 ports instead of USB 2. Box doesn't specify. I've now replaced it with another Mac keyboard w/ number pad. Live and learn."
3,Good emergency knife - not great for regular use,"This ia a great blade to leave in its sheath and to use only in case of an emergency. The blade is great for a $20 knife, but it doesn't seem to hold its edge well. I used it to cut rope, and after only about 30 or so uses, the blade started to become dull. I managed to sharpen it, but it went dull again even faster afterwards.However, it's initial edge is extremely sharp, so if you are genuinely going to wear it as a combat/emergency-only knife, it's perfect. As a daily use knife, go with a higher quality blade."
2,The Committee belittles Buckland's knowledge of the occult.,"Raymond Buckland is well know for his writing on the occult, including those aspects he covers in The Committee. He covers those aspects quite well, bringing out an interest in the subject, particularly for people who would not normally read his other material.Unfortunately, his writings on astral projection and other occult topics is supported by a weak cast of predictable characters and a stereotypical plot. In fact, all the requirements of a predictable plot are fulfilled - the hints of romance, the conflicts within the groups, even the backstabbing villain.The only reason to read The Committee is as a light preview to Buckland's other writing on the occult."
3,There are better books about screenwriting than this.,"Reading about screenwriting from someone who has actualy written AND sold screenplays is of course refreshing. That said, I personaly think the topics of the book are better covered by Robert Mckee, Christopher Vogler and Linda Seger. But of course the test for books about screenwriting is wether or nor it inspires the reader. And if you are looking for a very detailed step-by-step 'recipe' then this book might be for you."
4,Decent Alternative Sibelius,"Leonard Bernstein's series of ""Indian Summer"" recordings for DG included the beginnings of a second go-round with the symphonies of Jean Sibelius -- the First, Second, Fifth, and Seventh. They're all marked by often exaggeratedly expansive tempos, rubatos, and other indulgences; especially the popular Second, a bloated, belching affair I found hard to digest on first listen, but today can accept as an example of the conductor's unconventional latter-day proclivities...to be polite about it. However, Lenny makes a beautiful case for the First -- probably the most Tchaikovskian of the lot, but here given a singularly pointed treatment which makes it more incredibly dramatic than even the most diehard Romantic would ever think possible! I'm also coming to really love this most expressive (and often outré) rendition of the popular Fifth. Still, it's difficult to recommend these recordings for a novice listener."
5,AND THE OSCAR GOES TO..........,"WELL PROBABLY NOT, BUT I CERTAINLY NOMINATE THIS ALBUM FOR ONE. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A REALLY GREAT FLOWING ""CIRQUE"" ALBUM THEN THIS WILL PLEASE YOU FOR SURE. WE LISTEN TO IT OVER AND OVER AT HOME AND IN THE CAR. THE VOCALS ARE GREAT. COMPARE THE 30-SECOND CLIPS ON THIS ALBUM AND I AM SURE YOU WILL BUY IT."
3,Great for the price,But feels pretty flimsy. I wouldn't recommend this if you need a sturdy clip board for work. This is just being used as a place to clip my husband's schedules since they change weekly and we needed a spot for them. We hung it on the wall and it only ever sees 3 pieces of paper at most so it works wonderfully for our purpose.
4,Intriguing premise and characters with chemistry!,"We gladly suspend belief for Mary Kay Zuravleff's novel, The Frequency of Souls, a delightful tale with vivid characters and an intriguing premise that lures the reader along. Zuravleff gives her characters clear intentions, yet vulnerability based on idiosyncrasies that bring them to life. I appreciate the unpredictability of the chemistry between main characters, refrigerator engineers, George and Niagara. The secondary characters are as distinctive and well developed. While George's ponderings mire the plot about three quarters of the way along, the book picks up pace again for an ending that is not pat, yet pleasing."
3,Nothing or junk?,"Ritzer's heart is in the right place. As a critique of globalization and the destruction it causes, his book offers powerful insights. But Ritzer cannot resist the cliche and the clever clever rhetorical device that undermine his case. Worse - his narcissistic delight with using words in a manner meant to shock. In this book the word 'nothing' is asked to work beyond what the English language allows it to do. The emperor is unfortunately wearing far from nothing. He is well-clad, and sets the trends for others to follow. Globalization is destroying local traditions, lifestyles, practices and habits, not because it trades in nothing, but because it trades in seriously harmful junk."
2,"Not sure what's in em, crack for dogs?","These tablets must have something special in them, my dog was super hyperactive after eating them. Bouncing off the walls, very crazy. I'd like to believe she gets enough vitamins from her daily food, so I can't account for the strange increase in craziness. It wasn't just energy, it was like she had less focus and was much more distracted. When I stopped feeding these to her, she went back to normal. These tablets are made in India according to the package, not sure if that has anything to do with anything (I'm one of those paranoid dog owners that won't feed my dog anything from China - haven't heard anything specific about India though). Anyway, I'm sure these are working well for others, just my two cents on my experience."
3,Brown Betty Teapot - 6 Cup - 36 ounce,"I purchased one of these and found it does a great job. You won't be disappointed. The only problem I had was with the handle. It broke quite easily. I believe the handle was stressed in shipping, then finally broke. Who knows. I feel this should be handled with the utmost care. Obviously, dishwashers are off limits. I rate the tea making a 5 but can only give a 3 because of suspect quality."
2,"Great tea pot, but beware of distributor!","Although I have the 4-cup model, I have never had a problem with the Brown Betty. Not only does it produce a great liqueur (sp?) for some very hard-to-brew black teas, but it maintains heat very well, and somehow seems to prevent otherwise bitter teas from growing bitter too quickly. (it will, of course, grow if you keep the brew in there long enough). I AM careful (maybe needlessly?) not to wash my teapot with soap for fear of doing something to the glaze, and thus only use it -- in general -- for one kind of black tea (most often different grades of Darjeeling -- somtimes Ceylon). I don't know what you'd use for green teas -- I'd try some sort of purple clay unglazed (probably not the brown betty), but this is the top of the line for black teas.Definitely one of my prize collections, and I recommend this for any tea lover out there!..."
4,Flimsy release button,"Works great---but, the second time I used it the release button for the griddle plate broke off. We are still able to use the griddle; however, getting the griddle plate off and on takes a little work. After using the griddle the first time and seeing how well it worked, I threw away the box. I tried to get Rival to fix the griddle, but they wanted me to pay for the shipping and to find a box to return it in."
1,NOT non stick,"Cooked with this griddle 3 times and returned it. It is NOT non stick as advertised. Everything sticks, has to be scraped off regardless of lubricant used (Pam, olive oil, bacon grease, etc). Too bad, really, because I did like the size, controls, and removable griddle plate. But, not worth leaving part of the food stuck to the griddle or breaking egg yolks because they stuck. FYI - I washed by hand, not in the dishwasher. Luckily, I did not have any trouble returning it."
1,No prize for this old Turandot,"Nilsson was in bad voice. Bjoeling way,way, past his prime and needed ultra extra microphone that sounds fake. Tebaldi couldn't handle Liu's tessitura. And the noisy, poor 1959 sound conducted by a second rate conductor.Go for the Nilsson/Corelli 1964 live recording. That will blow you away. Nilsson was in super voice, he and Corelli fight to see who holds the longest high C. Wow.Another great is Sutherland/Pav/Caballe. Mehta is the real star in that one. Although Sutherland has the most beautiful voice I've ever heard although not a consonant in sight. Yet she has the voice Puccini would have like as the heroine-a Italian trained sound rather than Nilsson's Wagnerian one. Caballe is the ultimate liu.Anyway, take your pick. But not this one. Bjoeling is too tiny a voice and kills the piece."
4,Just what I needed.,"Love it - except when I'm not using an earpiece and have to hold the Treo up to my ear to use the phone. The screen cover, which is great at protecting the screen, protrudes at the top, and it hurts! Other than that, it looks great, the material feels great and is a cost-effective solution to protecting your Treo 650."
4,Treo 650 Protective Skin -- Clear,"I bought it as a present for a friend, and he says that it's the best item ever invented. It fits the phone perfectly (unlike some of the other cheaper ones, where the button impressions don't match up well-- so annoying). It doesn't make the phone bulky like some of the leather cases do. And, the material keeps the phone from sliding out of his pockets or his hands. The holster wasn't all that useful or sturdy, but otherwise two thumbs up!"
4,"not a ""must read"" but definately worth reading","i wouldn't say ""go out now and buy this book right now!!!"", however, if you are looking for a good sci-fi/fantasy type of book, with a straight up plot that is pretty straight forward, this book is worth your time. the characters are interesting, not stereotypical, and are fleshed out enough so you know them but you are not overburdened with smothering details.for me, the story moved a bit slow at first, and seemed thin and plodding in spots, but the book reads smoothly enough to where the short comings didn't kill the book completely.i like the statement it makes (in my opinion, this is how i took it) about art and how artists see the world around them. i like how the author includes the santa cruz earthquake and the way he describes some of the scenes are just perfect.the writing is good, not pretentious, and pretty smooth. the story is good, basic plot, pretty straight forward. worth it."
1,Healthy?????,When was margarin healthy??? I just looked inside here at Amazon and all the recipes started with MARGARINE!!! Margarine = Trans Fats!
1,Pretty but not functional,"This necklace is very attractive, but the catch is not functional. I was disappointed to see there is no return policy. Now I have to have it repaired before I can even wear it."
4,Really nice necklace,Pity I didn't keep this item for myself: the person I gave it to as a present didn't deserve it!
2,HARD TO MOUNT ON NEW CARS,I recently got a new Lexus. The front of the car is curved so there is no place to mount the whistles so they are lined up with each other. Check the car before you purchase these to see that there is an area deep enough [you need 2 inches for the mounting base] and that there is enough space where you can mount them 12 inches apart. Unfortunately this pair did not fit on my car.
5,CURLS REALLY WELL WITHOUT FRYING YOUR HAIR,This curling iron is the bomb! It is easy to handle and manage and the curls will stay in your hair!
4,Great Info on Genetics,This is a well written book that gives some great insight into the people working in the field as well as some basic understanding of genetics.
3,Should've made it one CD,"There's a lot of good tracks on this two-disc set but there's also a lot of ""filler"" tracks that clearly aren't Acid Jazz Classics (they might not even qualify as Acid Jazz). They've taken one CD's worth of material and expanded it to two discs, meaning that good tracks are sandwiched in between inferior tracks. My suggestion is if you buy this CD expect to make a compilation out of it to get that toe tapping and to save having to press the ""next"" button."
3,Don't attempt heavy load,"I bought one of these to hold my 30 lb center channel on top of my 61"" Samsung DLP. It worked just fine for about a week, and then last night the speaker came crashing down the back of my TV. The metal rods have ripped apart from the base (screws still in place, top part of metal rod itself ripped off). Also, the bolts that sit in front of the TV scratched my Samsung pretty good...it scratched it as I was installing it, and then again when it came crashing down.I'm not angry or anything, I was using this shelf at its weight limit, and perhaps a pound or two above. Also, my center channel extended behind the shelf (I have a deep center channel). I would imagine this shelf would work great for a lighter, shallower center channel. If you have a heavy or large center like me, you may be better off with a HyLoft Heavy Duty Wall Shelf. I just ordered one from Amazon...and I'm SURE it will be sturdy enough (designed to hold 200lb)."
4,Pretty good - does what you need it to do.,"I purchased this shelf to hold my Klipsch center channel. It is a little bit of a science project to properly ""size"" the legs and shelf, especially since I have a low profile projection screen (Sony KDS-60A2020)But once in place it seems to be plenty sturdy. And, it stays out of view nicely."
4,Nearly Perfect,"I highly reccomend this product with 2 caveats;the instruction manual is poorly written and illustrated and the front supports are too long for my TV's (Samsung HL-T5087SA)5/8"" bezel.I replaced them with wingnuts and now it's perfect."
1,Works fine - if it stays on your TV!,"Do not buy this thing! I followed the mounting directions carefully (I write directions/procedures for a living). It was on top of my Sony 50"" SXRD, with my 20 lb. Polk Center Channel Speaker, for exactly one day before everything came crashing down. The legs snapped off at the attachment screws up by the shelf and my speaker came crashing down behind the TV, hit the wall, and almost pushed the TV forward off of the stand. If I hadn't rushed to catch it, it could have ended up face down on the family room floor. From my experience, I would say that you can't trust this thing with anything over 10 lbs - if that."
5,Skinny Santa,I love the products made by Fitz and Floyd. This teapot was no exception. The design is beautiful and interesting and it makes a wonderful addition to my collection!
5,Simple and cheap,"This is a great item for the ""regular guy"" in astronomy. Sure there are more expensive options (laser) but if you're collimating your dobsonian with a friend there is no easier/cheaper way than this tool. I've lined up my 8 inch dob with this tool multiple times and it never fails. Love this piece. Makes up an essential part of my dobsonian toolkit."
3,Okay Collimator...,"This collimator is pretty fair, but I later ordered the laser collimator, and discovered that my main mirror was a little bit off. If you're on a tight budget, like I was, this will do a good enough job. Otherwise, get the laser! :)"
1,pee smell stays,this does not work only a quick fix smell comes back next day bad very sad it didnt work will mot suggest
3,Has the product changed?,"I have used PureAyre for several years and usually love how well this product works. However the latest batch does not seem to cover smells as well, appears very cloudy, and has plugged up the fine misting sprayers I used for years with PureAyre.A product this expensive could be prone to switching out with a less expensive product, like the Chinese are doing with wine.Just a thought."
5,Perfection!,"As a serious Glenn Miller Fan, I bought this CD for his music first. I had heard the Andrew Sisters on other compilation CD's and loved their talent, so I thought they and the Glenn Miller Orchestra would be a great combination. Well, I was right, but I wasn't prepared for how right I was! This CD is absolutely wonderful!! Not only do you get the intros and speaking from the band that make you feel you have just stepped back over 60 years, but you get the fabulous singing of the Andrew Sisters plus the Glenn Miller ""sound"", which compliments the sisters like peanut butter compliments jelly! And just like that combination, you'll love it and will never get enough of it no matter how old you are! I'm 36 so I didn't grow up with this music, but I am convinced that this era of music is the finest our country has or will ever produce. These were the true masters and nothing today can light a candle to this stuff! Enjoy this one!"
4,this is the model everyone wants,"we had trouble with the first shipment where the thread was stripped, but after a replacement model arrived (great amazon customer service as usual), have been happy with the product. spend the extra $$$ to get this model which will grow with your kids.the steering alignment could be better (not a teutonic bmw-like at all) as it takes a lot of effort to steer for the child. also, the separate basket doesn't stay on as well as we'd like over bumps.otherwise, don't buy the basket online as the shipping is prohibitive."
4,Nice piece of cookware!,"I have really just started using this for outdoor cooking but it is pretty cool. It is VERY heavy, which is mostly good and it looks like it will last forever. However, it is pretty heavy to carry around. The design on the lid is nice and sets it apart from other cookware. I haven't used the lid as a frying pan yet but it is nice that you can do that. If you want a thermometer to use in the channel the Weber 9815 Replacement Thermometer, also sold on Amazon, works perfectly. My main complaint, and reason for knocking off a star, is that it doesn't hang straight when using the handle to carry or support it. So far I have used it to cook over a wood campfire by using a tripod. If the pot is filled with liquid and you pick it up by the handle, everything spills. I bent the handle using pliers and it hangs much straighter now. I can hang it now but still not carry it. Overall, I think it is a great piece of outdoor cooking equipment."
5,Buy this album on itunes,"I love Tim Buckley. I looked for a long time and over-paid to get this album on vinyl. It is a great album (not his best as some say, Blue Afternoon is better) but a must own. The problem is that this album has not been reissued and the private sellers on Amazon/ Borders want you to take out a small loan to but this album. Good news is that itunes has released a digital downloadable version for only ten dollars. Do yourself a favor and just but it on itunes. I have it on my ipod and listen to it all the time. They also released Blue Afternoon and Greetings From L.A. both worth the ten dollars they cost."
3,Great for vegetarians,"I found the picture comparisons compelling, yet found the slant toward vegetarianism a bit off putting. If I ate all those carbs which are listed as preferable, I'd go on an eating binge that would last for weeks! Use this as a guideline, but not cast in stone. Stay in touch with your body and if you find yourself craving more carbs and sugar, add a little protein to the recommended regimens."
3,I'm torn,"I have a 11 year old St Bernard. I bought this for her in hopes it would help her stiff legs and hips. She was not a fan. I had to hide the pills to get her to eat them. The pills are huge and a dog her size has to have a couple a day. If they were meat flavored or scented or something, like the Heart guard chew-ables (the only medicine I don't have to fight her to take) maybe it would not have been such a fight. Its really hard to gauge if they helped or not. I've stopped using them as the money is better invested toward her pet insurance..."
4,it helps a lot,Took about two weeks and I was able to see a difference in my dog. I would like to keep him as active as I can.
4,Cosequin DS,Really helps my Great Dane. She is 5 years old and moves more frequently and with more flexibility. I can really tell when I run out and she doesn't get it for a few days. That is the testament to the product.
5,Cosequin DS has really worked for us.,Works so well for my 150lb. 10 year old dog. Excellent results. she used to limp but now she walks beautifully.
5,great product,"I have been giving this suppliment to my American Eskimo for years. Only recently - (she is now 14 1/2 years old) has she begun to show signs of stiffness. She is allergic to almost everything, and my vet said that this product was made with high quality ingredients, and would be least likely to cause her an allergic reaction. Also, she says they are yummy!"
4,A Great CD!!!!!,"A poignant, telling story of prostitutes in and around Times Square during the 1980's. Many people argue this show was the most solid of the 1996-1997 season, and I would have to agree. The dance music and songs by ""Barnum"" creator Cy Coleman really can't be topped. Some of the best contemporary voices (including B'way and Soul ""Diva"" Lillias White in her Tony-Award winning portrayal) are heard on this CD. A Must-Have for any B'way Fan!!! END"
5,A Worthy Read !,"This book is not just another book on the Family or Marriage issue. It is unique in that it takes the Bible and applies it very practically in the issues that peratin to Husbands and Wives. I don't agree with the social drinking stuff, but other than that it is really a worth while book to read. Good job Mr. Doug Wilson."
1,The author is a Christian Reconstructionist,"BUT if you are a Christian looking for what the Bible says about marriage you need to look elsewhere (there are plenty of excellent balanced books by Christians on this topic).There is just enough Bible verses BIble principles in this book to fool most Christians unaware of the teachings of Christian Reconstructisim and its dangers. Wilson is a strong Reconstructionist--which is nothing less than Christian Nazism. God's Word has much to say about those cursing Israel.This is SERIOUS dangerous movement followed by many leaders within the homeschool movement (see ""The Road to Holocaust"" by Hal Lindsey for a real eye opening about the Reconstruction/Dominion cult). Christian Reconstructionism is not Christian; it's a cult and needs to be treated as one."
5,A rare and overlooked jewel,"This album is a treat. Valerie is an outstanding singer with a truly beautiful voice, inspirational and invigorating."
3,"Field of view is relative to the projector, not the viewer","I was surprised to find that with my ceiling-mounted projector, I had to stand up with my head near the projector to get the best brightness with this screen. The screen basically reflects most of the light directly back at the projector, no matter where it's placed. I will have to move my projector to sit on the floor if I want to sit down low on the couch and watch movies. The brightness drops off pretty rapidly as you move away from the projector's position, and it's nearly unusable if you're more than 30 degrees away.I tried taping a white piece of paper to the screen to compare 'flat' brightness to the screen's reflectivity. At 15 feet from the screen, keeping your head within 4 feet of the projector gives you a better picture on the screen than on the flat paper. But beyond 4 feet, you're better off with the matte white of the paper."
3,No side effects,I am using this product to my 8 years old son for last 45 days. I feel that there is significant improvement in attention span. I am continuing this medicine for my son since there is no side effects. I guess the expected result will only been judged after 90 to 120 days.
1,It doesn't work. I still can't remember my childhood...,"Well, I just paid my taxes and used the money in my pocket at the local bookstore to pick up this rather interesting-looking book. I just finished reading it during Passover, and would like to share my impression. There are few exercises in this book, most of the book is filled with a bunch of stories of Wendlinger's childhood. It seems very self serving to write a book that people will buy as a kind of ""self help"" book that does not even pretend to offer help between the book covers. I don't want to give this book away and have my friends suffer through it, so I may just place it in the recycling, or let my hampster give it some personal attention, if you know what I mean.I'm sorry but this book wasn't worth the price, or the time it took to read."
4,Great book - but get another book to supplement,"This book is a great place to start when it comes to the new mastiff owner, but in terms of training you will definitely need another book to give you more detail. The color pictures are great and the information about picking a mastiff puppy is very descriptive and very helpful. Overall - great book."
5,Everything you need or want to know,"This book is all about the Mastiff from it's history to how to socialize them. The book tells you what you need to know so you can keep your mastiff in good health, believe it or not these giant dogs do have some special needs! This book tells you how to ensure you have picked a good breeder to buy a pup from how to choose a good pup. How to train your mastiff. Need I say more? If you want to get a mastiff read this book it will help you more than you could ever imagine."
1,godawful,This is by far the worst symphonic rock album available. Do NOT buy this. This record is 63 minutes of garbage. I actually emailed BMG and demanded a refund.
1,Didn't work!,The maternity support didn't stay in place. It kept bunching up in one spot and didn't help my back at all! I would not reccommend anyone to waste their money on this product.
1,not for the full figured mothers-to-be,"If I could have given this no stars I would have. This product in L-XL only fits a pre-pregnancy 28""-34"" waist. And in sizes that only goes up to a 18. So now I'm on the search for something a little bit bigger. So if your pre-pregnancy size is any bigger then a 16 on the safe side, dont waste your money or time by getting this."
1,Not much support at all. Don't waste your money,"This product is very thin and stretchy. If you are looking for some serious support, this is not for you."
2,no relief,"Based on the sizing instructions I ordered a s/m. I am 5'1"" pre-pregnancy size 8, pregnancy size 10/M. I received this band today and am nothing but uncomfortable; it is too tight and rolls anytime I move. I'm not sure I will be able to wear this all day much less find any relief from a heavy belly. I would definitely recommend ordering a size larger than sizing chart suggests. The seller shipped promptly, accurately and was timely."
1,Just don't....,"This book was awful. It just gave the air that he was trying SO hard to be funny that much of what he said made no sense. I feel like i need to go take a shower after reading it. It wasn't funny, and as such a failure in the parody department. This is hands down the worst book I've ever read. I think Hell will consist of being forced to read this book for all eternity.You should buy this book if your coffee table is uneven, or if you're running low on fire starters for the fireplace, otherwise, save your money."
3,"Well, It could be better (worse)...","This book was kind of weak. I laughed at some parts, but overall, it wasn't as good as it could have been. This is more a book to own than to read. If you own ""...Heaven"" then why not buy ""...Hell"" right? It's a funny conversation piece, and a fairly quick read. I would have liked to see a little more thought go into it.Mindless as it is, don't expect ""Desperate Housewives"" or ""Scrubs"" kind of entertainment, but maybe ""The Dukes of Hazard"" or ""News Radio (after Phil Hartman died)"". Dick Chaney is in it (hell, that is) and the whole ""Edgy Kreep"" thing is funny.If Hell were a book, it would be this book. I must say, however, I enjoyed it almost as much as I liked ""...Heaven"" which isn't saying much. I agree with Pablum's ""...Hell"" in it's feeling toward Ablum's ""...Heaven"" It was to sweet for it's own good. But ""...Hell"" is a little to ""huh?"" for it's own good."
2,"""The Golden Age of Looney Tunes Vol. 2""",I've watched the Bob Clampett cartoons and they are on this video.
3,Family prank - Mission accomplished,"I bought this as a ""gift"" for a family member who fancies himself ""the pink panther"". It is a little less soft than the picture shows. The dimensions are close and it is pretty well put together."
2,Expecting more than that...,"This movie is fine, but he image quality is not good, the sound terrible and the message was confusing. I've seen many alternative movies and I really like, but this one i was expecting more by the description we got here on Amazon. Good description, bad movie."
1,Fake information based on personal vendetta,"Having attended many of Rawlinsons's lessons, I see this book as an outcome of Rawlinsons personal vendetta against anything that was threatening to him during his live. He never was allowed into the inner circles of what he tried to research for the very reason of his egoistic and selfish personality, being a man in great need to shine as Mr. Judge or Mr. Sheriff (sharif)Rawlinson does not understand what he teaches/preaches. He is a walking dictionary, filled with facts, can draw on these facts like a computer, but what really counts... he does not live what he teaches, it's all rather fiction, he is a walkie-talkie of the finest order.... i.e. a kind of perpetum mobile."
5,One of the Best in Campground Books,"Most campground books give information on camping based on RV's. It is really difficult to find good information for tent camping. But this book gives wonderful descriptions of camp sites, trails, facilities, and other activities from the viewpoint of a tent camper. He tells which sites are the most enjoyable for people that like to experience nature and want to avoid concrete jungles. Each campground listed has a small illustration showing the camp sites and surrounding area. I especially like the ratings for beauty, privacy, spaciousness, quiet, security, and cleanliness. It is also very handy to have the information about nearby trails. I do wish the numbers on the state map showing the location of the campgrounds were bigger. I had to use a magnifying glass to see the numbers. Even so, this book is a definite ""MUST"" for all tent campers headed to Georgia."
5,great guide to local sites,Don't know where to go? Use this guide -- including regional maps! -- to find a site close to you or close to where you are traveling. It's rating system gives you a means to compare sites.
2,His knowledge is wide but shallow,"His typical book. A wide-ranging survey, with occasional interesting incident, but little insight or in-depth study. For all the books he produced, he doesn't have one defining insight. Also, his shallow knowledge produces, on occasion, very ridiculous conclusions. For example, he once concluded that the U.S. need not have ended slavery because sweatshops were just as bad(!!!) Needless to say, this comment earned him extreme hatred amongst some of the people in the class which used his books."
3,Unique perception on history,"If you are looking for a comprehensive treatise on the great civilizations of the world ... look elsewhere.Fernandez-Armesto discusses some of the major civilizations, but his focus is on the obscure. Nor is the book organized in a manner than makes much sense. Although Fernandez-Armesto acknowledges his ""nature-oriented"" perspective, it makes for difficult reading. This is coupled with the author's pretentious writing style. Reading the book, I had to wonder for whom he was writing this book. Unless one is well versed in history, this books will leave the reader confused rather than enlightened.I would recommend this book for historians, but not for the average reader."
3,Okay,The story has a slow start but does get interesting near the end. Over all it's a fairly good book.
3,Didn't move me.....,"It was so much like every other book that aims to make you feel better about yourself. All true, presented in an organized manner, but reminded me of Oprah's ""favorites"" - nice if you can get and afford them."
5,Great Shirt,"First vendor I tried to purchase this from listed it as In Stock, but then cancelled my order 3 days later saying they were out of stock. So my second attempt at getting the t-shirt was starting out a little negative. However, the shirt arrived within the time specified with no problems.I would have liked to receive a shipping notification or a tracking number so I wasn't left in the dark, but everything processed as it had been stated."
2,Stale Cinnamon,"The past six months I've been trying all the zinger teas available on Amazon (after learning about the high antioxidants found in Hibiscus tea). This is definitely my least favorite (FYI, the Tangerine Orange is my favorite).I should mention that I've been using these teas as iced tea. This particular flavor is definitely more suited to be a hot tea. Even then, the apple flavor is very faint, and the cinnamon flavor seems stale to me. Not sure that's the right wording - the cinnamon flavor tastes a lot like the flavor in cinnamon gum, rather than the cinnamon flavor in a pastry or something. I hope that makes sense."
3,there are better ones,"There are better ""after birth belly bands"" This one however does itch and yes its sweaty underneath on your skin, but what can you expect. Its cheap non the less. It worked for though. Everyone couldnt believe how small I had gotten when I was 2 months post pardom. It itched like hell and it was very uncomfortable, but it works. Really, I swear by these things."
3,Moves around a bit,"You should wear a tight tank top underneath it, so keep it from scrunching up!! The longer your torso, the better it will fit!"
3,really three and a half stars,"I love R. Hell. In this book,he doesn't squirm away from letting his narcissism, mysogeny and his bend toward sadism hang out dripping wet for us to inspect. Some passages are gut wrenching honesty. I wouldn't really read this as a novel, though. I picked it up and put it down at leisure, with the exception of San Francisco to Colorado. And then Kentucky is backyard to some dirty long jones.I felt more that I was peeking into a diary, not reading a novel. I just expect more. But read it all the same; it's good stuff."
5,MST3K the movie is awesome,This is a must have for MST3K fans and could easily create new fans. Very well done.
5,Recognize Me Now Ruth???,"This is by far, the greatest movie ever made. My friends and I have constantly been renting it for the past 6 years, and none of us bought it until today. It was impossible to find ANYWHERE, and we even tried to just not return it to the video store. People would think we were weird for quoting it constantly, but it is the most quotable movie ever! It has the greatest one-liners, that are funny in any circumstance.No matter how many times you have seen it, it will always be funny, because everytime you watch it you will catch a joke you never heard before, either because you were laughing so hard from the previous one, or you didn't know what the heck they were talking about. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, although it does take a certain person to watch it. You either have to be so dumb that it is funny, or smart enough to get the intellectual jokes. Regardless, it is definitely a must watch!"
3,Funnier than Ross Perot,"Actually, my review would be somewhere BETWEEN three and four stars, but since Amazon.com doesn't allow me to do that, my loss. A very funny movie that's worth a watch. For Mystery Science Theater fans (like myself), it's a five-star better-than-Fargo-or-Casablanca classic, but for others, you may just not get it. I love it, though. Great one-liners and overall fun. It'll make you love bad movies again (if you ever did, that is)."
5,Two Movie for the Price of One!,"As the proud owner of the MST3K boxed DVD sets, this movie was a ""must see."" The best part is that the worse the movie Mike Nelson, Crow and Servo are watching, the better the wisecrack remarks coming from the trio.Island Earth is a movie made for MST3K projection. The remarks by Nelson and the robots were so fast and furious, a few times we had to stop the DVD and rewind; we were laughing so hard we missed a few lines. One of the robots even recognized that one of the scientists in the movie played the ""professor"" on Gilligan's Island. And this happened right after we remarked, ""Hey, isn't that..."" It was hysterical.This is one of the best MST3K's I've seen."
2,Yuck!,"This movie did a poor injustice to the series as a whole. the comments made no sense and I almost fell asleep during it. the only thing that makes this movie buyworthy is the shorts in between the movie. I hate to say it but I rather watch Red Zone Cuba or Eegah then this one. Don't count me wrong, I love MST 3K, I got all their tapes but this one was a bomb."
5,The Best Of Dr. Forresters Experiments,This Island Earth has to be one of the worst movies ever made. No wonder it ennded up on MST3K. MST3K the movie is hallariouse.
5,"""I've never seen its equal!""","First, I'd like to say thank you for reading this. Being as I am the first MSTie to write about this movie, I feel that I should say, ""Gee whiz! No one else wrote here!"" There. I got it out. Whew! By the way, are you eating celery? Any way, I'm assuming you already know the jist of the show: A guy and 2 robots are stuck in space and are forced to watch horrible movies. They keep their sanity by making fun of these ""gems"". What you're reading about is ""the movie"", which was released in thaetres! HOLY MOLEY! This is a really suberb orientation for those homo sapiens who have been neglegent in the viewing of this video cassette. I don't, like, want to, y'know, sorta like ruin this totally tubular thing upon which you're gonna embark. Right? Good God! Buy or rent it already! You are driving me INSANE! G-O-O-O-O! Sincerely, 2 true MSTies END"
4,Light and effective,"I've been using tasers for a good while now. As a proffesional bodyguard, I need to keep people under control, and nothing beats a taser for the job. Unfourtunately, it's really uncomfortable to walk around with a taser in your hands. Sometimes, I just REALLY need the use of my left hand, no ifs, ands or buts about it. That's where this holster comes in. Put your taser in, take it out, it's quicker than a Disney world rollercoaster ride and smoother than a freshly opened bottle of Jack. Only problem is the price. At that level, only your real proffesionals will buy this. Take it down a notch and you got my five stars."
2,disappointing,"The Union Pacific section is nothing more than previous scenes from ""Last of the Giants"" and Video Rails UP collections, the rest of the program is okay at best...a lot of it is just excursion trains in which I have zero interest......Overall a mediocre effort and I do not recommend it"
5,Touching,I was unable to put this book down. The story is amazing and putting this book down was not an option. I laughed and I cried and highly recommend this touching story. I cannot wait for another book from this author.
4,A great story worth reading,"This is not the typical read for me, but I was intrigued after hearing about how it was self-published and still became popular. It is the story of a girl in a very small town growing up without her mother. The book is well-written, the characters developed and interesting, and the plot moves along. All in all, a very enjoyable read and one I would definitely recommend. I, too, will be looking forward to her next book."
4,A little piece of Americana,"""Without Grace,"" is an engaging story of one family's life struggles. Vicky Finley grows from childhood into womanhood longing to know her mother and blaming her father for her loss. Set in small town NY, this story depicts and defines a world many of us thought was long gone; but despite our worldy notions these places still exist. Whether you grew up in the hubub of city life or the overscheduled and competitive suburbs there is a universal element in Ms. Hoenig's tale that you can connect to beyond the agrarian setting. At some point we all long for that missing something or someone to love us, to make us whole. What we learn from Vickey and her community is the value we place on ourselves and how we became who we are. This book would make a wonderful Lifetime movie...if you enjoyed ""The Secret LIfe of Bees,"" or ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" you will quite easily get caught up in the trials and triumphs of the Finley family."
5,NIRVANA!!!,"I was so excited to see that this recording will finally come out on CD. This is Doug at his finest. Doug and his collaborators put together the best, raw, spontaneous set that I have ever heard in my entire life. Not only is this my all time favorite Doug Sahm recording, it is my all time favorite recording, period!! Doug and his Band groove out Blues, Country, Swing, Tex-Mex and Rock....and it is all raw, fun and powerful. Guest stars include Dr. John, Bob Dylan, Flaco Jimenez, Jack Barber, Augie Meyers and David Bromberg to name a few. This CD is well worth the wait and the price."
4,Doug's first solo disc - with help from Dylan!,"From the first cut ""Is Anybody Goin' to San Antoine"" (one of Doug's minor hits) to the last, this is one great CD. The tune ""Wallflower"" by Dylan is one of Doug's best ever; the only problem with the album is there are a few too many covers, but his version of ""Faded Love"" is outstanding. A little more country-oriented than some of his other albums, this is certainly one of the best. If you're new to Sahm and enjoy his country material, then pick this up. There's also some straight blues and tex-mex included as well, but a country vibe dominates."
2,A Considerable Disappointment,"I understand that marketing strategy is key to the success of any book, but in interviews regarding his biography, Tim Willis has been misleading with respect to his purported ""interview "" with Syd. I think the intention was to build up suspense, saying that he had interviewed Syd, while In fact, it was no more than a doorstep encounter (borderline harassment) that is already all over the internet. Which brings me to another point : you may read a good 90% of this ""book"" on the internet as part, or all of, various Syd-related articles, I recognised the descriptions word for word, as I knew I was not reading it for the first time. Worse, Willis goes on to criticise other biographical efforts on Syd by name, it just didn't make me feel right. The rare photos, however, were good, notably courtesy of Lindsay Corner.Shine on for eternity, You Crazy Diamond"
2,sigh,"Perhaps early success is an utter curse; I begin to wish no one were allowed to publish a 1st book till they turned 35 (note: burn your MFA theses!) Early success seems to engender a pavlovian response: what we're praised for, we do again & again. And so, here, we have Volkman repeating herself for 50-odd pages, saying nothing with stylistic cleverness equivalent to a parlor game, relying on style as a crutch to mask a startling substance deficit. One, two, three poems glimpsed here & there in our best journals were riveting; seeing 20-some all together will engender much wincing in those of us who had our hopes up. Still, I hold out hope for book three--may it be a careful slow while in coming--"
5,Fast problem free service,"No problems. Found what I needed, oredered it, and it arrived a few days later."
1,Don't buy for a cell phone,"The card I bought doesn't work! In any cell phone!! Don't know why as other cards do work, Kingston."
5,Micro card,Product was very suitable and arrived quickly and in good condition. Can recommend it to anyone
5,Good,"I don't even remember when I bought this, but being it was a 1GB, I'm guessing it was forever ago! Either way, I've upgraded since, but never had any problems with any Sandisk memory devices."
4,Very adaptable...but small,"The positive about this MicroSD is that it holds a lot of memory and is versitile because you can switch the information between different devices that use the standard or MicroSD sized slots...which obviously makes for less steps you have to take to move information. The only negative that I have had with it is trying to remove the MicroSD from the adapter. It's not easy...and it doesn't matter if you have fingernails. In one sense that's good because it doesn't slide out easily, so you don't have to worry about it falling out and losing it. However, you do have to worry about popping it out and flying somewhere, then spending the time to try and find it...and it's small. All I can say is, pull it out at/over a table. Bottom line...great price, great product"
3,nice steel - not so good design,nice good quality budget knife - but no good for chopping. The base of the blade is not deep enough and my knuckles hit the cutting board with each chop. Handle is a bit short for my largish hands too. Otherwise a great product.
2,Pales in comparison to their pecan blend,"This one did not do it for me at all. I buy these Sahale blends because I enjoy their complex flavors. However, unlike their pecans (Valdosta) where the flavors of all the ingredients come through with each mouthful, I find the pistachios overwhelm everything else in the blend. I might as well just buy a bag of pistachios and save money. Worth a try, since many people like them. I just wouldn't go out and buy six bags of them without trying a bag locally or just getting a single bag or one of their sample packs."
3,Chewy & Spicey,Very chewy & very spicey. I prefer the Valdosta Blend to this but it is a nice change and makes a healthy snack.
1,"""O,"" Beware....","I have nothing against Oprah. But, Sir David Attenborough is the top nature narrator on the planet. When there is an option, why take anyone else? I bought the Life series with Attenborough. Not only is he a great narrator, the series is complete--unlike the US verson. The US version is shortened for commercials and the extra ""How it was filmed"" segment is not included with each episode as it with the UK version.All-in-all, the UK version is far superior in many ways."
5,A sure fire giggler,"Whenever we have guests over who are willing to read books to our kids (relatives and close friends!) we always put this one in the stack. It's such a fun book to read outloud, and fun to listen to others read it for the first time as they can't help but laugh as they turn through it.We'll save it for our kids to read to their own some day."
3,Good and bad!,"I was fascinated by the anecdotes of animal behavior, most of which were new to me. But as other reviewers have noted, going from animals to human behavior led to some over the top ideas. It had a sort of '60s feel and when I read the blurb, I was amused to find he lived just where I would have expected - Berkeley! And although he says he and most of his friends would not be bothered by finding out their children were the product of another man, I doubt very much if this is a general feeling!!!"
4,Involved Animal Fathers Exist,"THE EMPEROR'S EMBRACE is full of information about how different animals father their offspring as well as theories/conclusion about why they father as they do. I am more interested in the ""hows."" I had no idea so many animal males were involved fathers and that some males joined with other males to form a family unit, ideally including children.Very Interesting:Author Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson quotes from a behavior psychologist I'd never heard of, John B. Watson, and this has led me to try to find Watson's book PSYCHOLOGICAL CARE OF INFANT AND CHILD, 1928. I believe it will advance my perspective on the generation reared with the dictum ""Never hug and kiss your them [children], never let them sit in your lap"" --in other words, affection will ruin a child--and how that rule has been passed along."
4,Ben Webster,"This is a good veiw of what Ben Webster was like! I think it would have been even more interesting if the director had spent a little more time with the interview, asking more questions, etc.In this project we are able get an idea of what a day with Ben Webster is like. We sit-in on a rehearsal and also hear him discuss what being with Duke Ellington was like. This is a good DVD because eventhough we know of his music it is always good to get an idea what Ben Webster (the person) is really like..."
1,One of the first ..... but not one of the best,"Granted this game helped pave the way for more recognition for the MMORPG genre, but that doesn't mean it is one of the better MMORPG. The one thing I really couldn't stand was the horrible control of the veiw and the constant ... chat that was flowing through the screen. If you want to get a good MMORPG to get started ..... go with microsoft's Asheron's Call. If you want a really, really good MMORPG then wait about a year when all the well produced ones will be coming out."
1,Tech Support From The Dark Ages,"Unfortunately I never got to try this game as numerous connection problems prevented the updates from downloading prior to play. Appaling tech support, and complete lack of interest of customer service. Forget this product, try Asheron's Call instead."
3,Is this a game for Role Players?,"I have been playing EverQuest for about 6 months off and on, and I have played almost every class to a certain point. All I can really say is that when I first got this game I would find abunch of roleplay, but that turned to disappointment being that almost 70% of the servers are filled with power gamers (Those that just hunt and don't roleplay). Sure I love this game, but if you want to find alot of roleplaying going on this is not the game for you."
1,Everquest... Hm...,"I'm a fanatic about RPG's, from Asherons call to MUD (many user dungeon), and another MUD player told me to get Everquest. I installed it, and it took AGES to connect. It's the slowest game I've ever played, and you have to wait to go into another area. The bad thing about it is the speed. The graphics are not all that bad, but I don't recommed this. . . :("
5,Kunark does it again for EverQuest,"This game is a very well made graphical interface that will have you calling in sick to work the next day! This game allows you to play a multitude of races (from elves to trolls and the new lizard men) and alows you to choose your character's appearance, so you don't look like every other Tom, Dick or Harry adventurer. You are able to develop your trade skills (cooking, fletching, gemsmithing, etc.) to expert levels while at a low level, making the game easier for people wanting to buy the best in armor, weapons, spells and magic items."
5,The most Addictive Game I've ever played,"Everquest is single most addictive game I've ever played. I've racked up over 1400 hours playing this game since last November. This game has more facets than the Hope Diamond! And its affect can be as disasterous to your social life. The game has scores of zones to explore. Hundreds of quests to resolve (some of which are Broken) Monsters to slay and loot to collect. There are on average 70,000 people playing this game on a nightly basis. Many of whom have been there a LOT longer than me. I can see how some would find it boring because nothing is as easy as it should be. This is a thinking man's game. The more you play it the more addicted you get. I see a lot of youngsters try it and leave quickly."
3,Poor quality,The battery is a big bulky thing that connects to the screen through the bars and with any amount of tugging on the screen the battery falls right off onto the floor. The screen also shakes and doesnt run smoothly. Not at all the quality I was expecting.
4,AWESOME PRODUCT BUT WAY WAY WAY TOO LOUD!!!,"I LOVED this when I saw it online (and loved the idea you can connect an MP3 player to it, although we dont have one as yet) and quickly ordered it online and was really excited when it arrived. That was UNTIL I installed it and turned it on ready to take my wee one into dreamland. OMG he nearly jumped out of his skin! The volume on it is WAY too loud for its intention, to help soothe to sleep. I have many different toys for a similar purpose, the best of which have volume control or at least two different volumes. I did manage to put some invisible tape over the speaker which did help but shouldnt have had to! Very bad design fault on an awesome product, from one of my fav brands. Still giving it four stars tho because it is awesome with the volume made more acceptable for baby to fall asleep too!"
5,Great Performance - You be the judge of reliability,I just purchased my third. My previous two lasted over two years each. I am a hobbyist woodworker but also refinish furniture and I estimate I've put 100+ hard hours on each of my previous two. I use dust collection about 80% of the time. I rate this sander's performance at 5 stars because it is agressive and powerful with little vibration and performs its intended duties well. In my experience it outperforms direct competitors' models and has better reliability. I am more than satisfied with the durability and rate it 5 stars as well because the operating cost relative to purchase price is quite cheap - beats hand sanding!
1,"Yuch. ""Hot New Country"".","Tim McGraw. The great singer, not to mention equally adept at selecting great material. Who could ever forget that great, great song ""I like It, I Love It, I Want More Of It""? What lyrics!!!! Did Hank Williams write that, by any chance?"
3,This is an 'OK' Album,"My husband bought this Album for me for my birthday and I thought that it was an 'OK' Album. Tim McGraw's style and tone throughout this album were all the same. This is a nice album to listen to, but it is not so memorable. I understand he truly loves his wife, Faith Hill, but did he have to pour his heart out in to each and every track on this album? I think not!I did enjoy listening to the track 'My Best Friend', but unfortunately this was the only track that caught my attention."
3,a decent mainstream country album,"while in concept the reviews here on amazon.com are a good development: real people rather than critics get to have their say. but come on. every book or album is either five stars or one star. and almost all are five. it's boring. one of the people on here said ""a place in the sun"" is the album of the decade. geez, you need to get out more. this is a good album with sometimes too-slick production, sometimes too cliched lyrics. but it's fun and pretty solid. it's a good summer album."
3,Good quality container,"The container is well made and useful, but I didn't really notice much difference in marinating. I used a commercial marinade, hooked up the vacuum pump, then put it into the refrigerator for the time recommended. Seemed exactly the same as when I've marinated in the past. It's a very useful size and definitely sealed the odors well, so I'm pleased with it overall."
2,Stay away from this compilation!!!,"When I bought this cd set, I imagined having a wonderful collection of 100 retro hits of the 80's. Whilst I certainly don't doubt that these tracks are from the 80's, they are not indicative of the wonder & magic that one associates with that rich period in the annals of music history.The packaging is alright - the cds are neatly inserted in sleeves made of card paper. The upside is that the audio quality is excellent.However, if a music buff like me needs to make an outright effort to remove this cd from the drawer & listen to it, then I don't doubt, for a second, that you will too."
1,Don't Buy This,"I bought these mini DVD and they do not work with the video camera, always appear an error. I do not recommend purchasing this product"
3,Content is good - writing style is horrendous,"This book covers a wide range of security engineering related domains. In general, the content is good and the level of detail is high-level in order to cover the wide scope of topics.However, the writing style leaves much to be desired. The book is peppered with sentences starting a discussion on a topic and then abruptly ending it, referring to other chapters for more details, which quickly becomes very annoying to the reader.The style of writing is also dry as a mouthful of flower. In addition, the layout of the book will put most readers to sleep since there are few figures and diagrams to explain relationships and methodologies where needed.Hopefully the shortcomings will be fixed in the second edition."
4,Nice size and function,"Overall its a great and comfortable mouse...the one thing I dislike is that when you squeeze the sides, even gently sometimes, the battery compartment opens up."
4,Kensington S1670m works fine,"The Si670m was easy to set up with my MacBook Pro, and is working as advertised. No problems at all."
2,Poor design of battery housing.,"The battery housing of this mouse is accessed by a spring-loaded door at the base of the mouse. The door is released by squeezing either side of the mouse. Whenever you pick up the mouse, hold it to switch the power, or hold it with any sort of grip, the door pops open and the batteries fall out. Exceptionally poor design.Otherwise, not a bad product. Range of the bluetooth is 15 or more feet and battery life is perfectly acceptable.However, based on the issues with the battery door alone, I would not buy this mouse again."
1,"This mouse is poor quality, heavy, too small, difficult to move around.","I returned this mouse. Why?- It is cheap quality. I don't know what happened to Kensington, but the last time I bought one of their products (1996 or so, it lasted a long time) they were well-made. This one feels like a child's toy destined to break.- The size is terrible. It is too small from end to end, and too bulky (top to bottom) at the back end, making it uncomfortable to use.- It is very heavy and difficult to move around on a mouse pad. My girlfriend's Logitech mouse moves around like a feather. The Kensington feels like a dumptruck by comparison.I thought this would be an upgrade to the Apple Mighty Mouse that came with my iMac, however this is not the case. I sent back the Kensington and am sticking with the Mighty Mouse for now."
2,Disapponinted,"I'm very disappointed because the product description read ""Closed-captioned"" and guess what, it is not closed-captioned. I don't have a problem with that, but I wanted to watch this movie (which I love) with my husband, who has a hard time understanding English and has never seen it. Now, I'll have to watch it by myself."
3,Red gloves connection,"Very good Christmas stories. Sentimental, as Christmas stories should be. A very good gift for a friend who likes fiction and needs to be able to read it in short periods, rather than all at once"
1,Hackneyed garbage.,"What a disappointment; bad scripts, bad acting (except Vanessa Redgrave), poor direction - but with those scripts, no wonder! - flat and boring.The unbelievability of the 'plots' is an insult to the viewer.What was a fun series has turned in to dull, monotonous, characterless and vapid waste of time; could do well as a US daytime soap.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
3,a few bright spots in a weak season,"Season 6 is by far the weakest of all 7 seasons of this series. Rose mcGowan was not the greatest choice for Teddy, Annie's psychic trauma should have been more fully explored, Liz was too easy on Christian, and Wilber barely showed up at all.It's still worth watching for the overall strengths of the main cast members, the music, and some storylines, but that's about it."
2,Doesn't last long,I have the 4pcs. set of Dewalt 18volt tools. They worked fine until the batteries gave out on me. This was after only 13 months. ...it is totally worthless unless you spend [more money]. on new batteries. This is a mighty expensive hobby. They need to do something to make a better and more reliable battery. I won't be back for anymore of their products until they take care of that problem.
4,The best Copland 'bests' CD......,"Out of all of the CDs which contain the 'best' Copland works, this one is the best for your money. You get nice quality, nice selections, and a confusing CD case (which is confusing to open). The Tender Land excerpts introduced me to one of the best operas ever. Copland, who conducts this and Appalachian Spring, did a marvelous job capturing his own spirit of the rural American life. Don't stop at this CD though! There's so much more great Copland! Tender Land is wonderful! Also his Symphony no. 3, which incorporates Fanfare for the Common Man into it, Red Pony, Down a Country Lane, and the Old American Songs (which contains a couple of familar tunes you'll hear from this CD). This is a good one! Not perfect (stuiped CD case) but good."
4,"Healthy, flavorable and unusual","I have all of the flavors and never remember which is best, but they are all good. Different nuts dominate each blend, e.g. walnuts, almonds, pecans, macadamias, etc. They have a bit of dried fruit in each variety, again, all different, and an unusual kick to each. One has notes of black pepper, another chili, but none are overpowering and/or ""hot.""One caveat, if you are like me and lack willpower, order the 2oz varieties. I started with the 5 oz. packs and kept on eating until the bag was empty. Way too many calories for me.Try the assorted product first and see if you have a particular favorite. I enjoy them all."
4,Only if you like spicy...,"I bought the variety pack and tried this flavor second (see my review for Socorro). I buy natural snacks for my kids (freeze dried fruit etc with no added sugar), but I find them bland. So I ordered these and loved the Socorro, but this one was much more spicy. My 4 year old did NOT like this one - too spicy for her and for me."
4,A nice purchase for a serious book lover,This book with its clear print and gorgeous illustrations is an excellent edition of Thoreau's personal commentary about his life in New England. It makes a welcome addition for a bibliophile's library.
3,Blah,"The bad: This item (along with several similar others) simply appears to be an enlargement of a vintage postcard. The quality is just not that good at 17x11. The image suffers from very obvious printer dots and is somewhat fuzzy due to the apparent enlargement. If it was scaled to the original print, or not enlarged it would not be so noticeable.The good: the paper quality is good and heavy, and while the reproduction is not that great the ink quality is good."
4,Works well,Bought this to wear with the SPF 41 tinted product and like it. Dermatologist recommended this brand. I recommend it too.
1,The Dead Zone (TV Pilot),"While I loved the DVD, it's not worth the money if you are planning on buying the complete first season. I bought the first season DVD after taping every episode from the TV. The TV Pilot makes it sound like it was not aired on TV. It was and I had it on a VHS tape (I threw them away when I bought the DVD's). If you buy the complete first season, the episode is listed as ""Wheel Of Fortune"". ..."
5,Add this to your collection,"Although the pieces start to sound alike, the melodies are gorgeous and the piano/cello arrangements are sublime. Great for an evening of solitude, romance, or a cocktail party."
3,Hard to put together,I only gave this item a 3 star due to it not coming with any directions to put it together. Not sure if mine just did not have them or if they don't include them. Once we put it together it works perfect for blankets and towels for our baby and looks very nice in the room.
1,Biggest piece of garbage I ever bought!,"I honestly cannot believe what a piece of junk this is. The dowels that hold the main frame together are not pre-drilled, and if you pre-drill them yourself (if you even own a power drill), the screws just strip regardless. If you drill the holes large enough to make the screws not strip, it won't hold the frame together. This product is literally impossible to put together. If by some miracle you do manage to technically put it together, I cannot imagine it ever having the capacity to hold ANYTHING without collapsing. Please, please save yourself the headache and just skip this one!"
1,Not stable,The organizer is well thought out with 6 cubbys. I store all of my son's clothes in it. However it is very unstable. It leans at almost a 45 degree angle to prop itself up against the wall. I cannot put this anywhere near his room or anywhere he can get a hold of it because a sneeze would knock it over.
4,Lucky T,This was a good book in the begening and by the end you just wanted her to go home! I was upsat that she didn't find the T-shirt she went all the way to Inada to find but over all it was a good book
2,UGH!,"i didnt not at all like this book! i felt that this girl is WAY TOO spoiled and it made me mad how if she didnt get her way she would turn into the PRISSY girl who was ""too good"" for work. Her attitude wasnt exactly the greatest. All she wanted was her lucky t. and if she didnt get it she would cry. She acted like she was better than everyone. and i just didnt like it. UGH!"
3,The pluses and minuses vs. HP3150,"At last, manufacturers are realizing business users want laserrather than inkjet multifunction devices. Copy quality and speed isfar superior and cost per page much lower. For over a year, I used an HP3100 which had the market to itself. We needed to add a second machine and purchased the XE90 which competes directly with the current HP model 3150. Advantages of the XE are slightly faster speed and having both ADF and flat bed scan/copy/fax. However, the XE90 has only one paper input tray, whereas the 3100/3150 has a second adjustable input slot for envelopes, labels, second sheets. This may be a decisive feature difference for some office users. Without the second input source, each and every time you print a letter plus envelope, after printing the letter you then have to unload the tray, adjust to envelope size, and after printing the envelope readjust the tray to letter size and reload the paper. END"
5,Very comfortable,"I love my curiosity Mogu pillow, its very comfortable to sleep with and it is very cute. A must buy for anyone who ever likes Mogu in the slightest."
5,THIS GAME IS AWESOME!,"Thief 2 is the game of the century! tHe first game knocked me of my feet with the awesome plot, graphics , and gameplay. The idea of the game, stealing, be stealthly, was a million dollar idea. I'm telling you, this is a GREAT game. Its REALLY worth your money."
2,Visible Scratches,"Unfortunately when I received the CD both disks 1 and 2 had visible scratches in the data side. When listening to Disk 1 track 8 it had a silent spot, and clicking near the beginning of track. Returned CD."
2,Pass on this one,"This album is a collection of remakes of the originals. This is not what I had in mind, hence my low rating. It wasn't clear by the discription, but I should have known by the price. The music has lost a significant part of the 1960's sound which appeals to me."
1,Not as advertised.,"I bought this item as a anniversary gift for my wife. The perfume was suppose to be brand new in box, it was not. They did give me a refund."
5,A Well Done Update,"This is a good book. All of the criticisms about the rewrite are valid, but, in this version of this book we are fortunate that the author was able to focus more on the 6 upgrade of Lightwave. I counted over 100 pages of the book devoted particularly to constraints. (Ablan's book has 2 pages). This is a nutritious update to a fast moving target, and my only regret that he couldn't update it after 6.5, or 7 also......Your Mileage May Vary, I liked it."
4,Excellent book,"I enjoyed immensely this book on the celtic mythological creatures (and I still believe in most of 'em!). The artwork was compelling, and the folk stories were excellent. My only complaint was that some of the information was historically inaccurate; however this didn't happen enough to take away from the value of this book."
5,Nice product,Got this while I was setting up my new house. I've had this for one year now and it looks really nice on the kitchen and is very handy to keep some drinks bottles without wasting space at all. Great product.
5,Looks great on my mom's wall!,"I bought this for my mom as she was looking for something cute to put her wine in. This holder looks really nice, we put it up diagonally. Although the grapes are a little flimpsy, so we had to glue them on again. Other than that, great buy for the price!"
2,Gray's anatomy?,"I cannot fathom why this text is called ""GRAY'S ANATOMY for Students,"" as it bears no relation to the original text. As I prepare for my 1st gross anatomy exam, I can't imagine how the little information in this text will give me anywhere near a deep enough understanding of the material. And the illustrations! What happened to the beautiful, original Gray's illustrations? This book is little more than a glorified Atlas of Anatomy, and I find Grant's Atlas a much more useful resource."
4,At last - a lighter read on a heavy subject,"Warwick has done a fair job in tackling a faily in depth and for many, a fairly boring subject. I am a fund manager and don't necessarily enjoy reading such books but do so as it is an occupational requirement.It is refreshing to read a book that sheds some new light on the subject often with a touch of humor so lacking in other books written by intectuals who: 1. Have never traded or managed money before yet believe they are qualified to discuss certain subjects in depth 2. Confuse their talent with their ego.Warrick does not make any pretence that this book is directed at a certain market. However, for those who manage money professionally and are ethical enough to actually work in the best ineterests of their clients, read this book. You'll find it both entertainig, and refreshig."
4,Quality,"A quality effort from the lads who have clearly given 110%, and you can't ask for more than that. Radnedge bosses it in the mid-sections of the book like the workhorse he is as Lineker delivers quality from the fringes, living on scraps. In short, a guaranteed net-bulger."
2,intriguing and confusing,"I bought this book after reading the author's website and listening to a recorded interview of her views on the 2012 benchmark.She sounded highly cogent, intelligent, sensitive and serious.I could not understand most of what she was talking about in this book; there were too many references to matters I'd never heard of before; this process continued throughout the book so that by the end I had no idea at all of what she was discussing."
2,"Too much telling, not enough showing","There's a good, rich story here, but it doesn't make for the absorbing novel it should. Wenner, a fine journalist, hasn't quite made the leap to a successful fiction style. There's too much summary narration, and much too much explaining of themes, ideas, and characters' motivations; I wish she'd trusted the story itself to carry more of that weight. I feel sure it could."
2,Not carry-on size,"This was much bigger and bulkier than expected - it's definitely too big to be carry-on size as I had incorrectly assumed. But it's not so huge that I'd want to keep it for using as checked baggage. I will be returning this. Don't make the mistake I did, take a close look at measurements closely before you buy. The overall quality of it does seem good, but I think you could find just as good for much cheaper elsewhere."
2,Beginners... Don't waste your money,"In contradiction to an earlier post which expressed this was a good book for beginners, I would highly recommend beginners and those with desire for practical implementation to buy Lin and Costello's book. This book lacks in the quality and quantity of its examples. It may serve as a good reference for the more theoretically motivated person (e.g., those in the academic publishing community) but if you want to own just one book, don't get this one."
4,Excellent practice for NYS Regents,"This book is a valuable resource for help in studying for the NYS Bio regents. It gives very good explanations of answers and allows you to analyze your weak spots. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that the actual review material is skimpy and not well defined, but they do have a separate ""Let's Review"" book that better aids with that."
3,Probably more than you want or need to know,"Overall I think this book is above average. However, the first portion of the book seems bent on defining the hazy difference between the web and the Internet. Why so much time is spent on this is beyond me. The reader doesn't really get into the useful meat of the book until the second 100 pages. The reader also needs to absorb the book with a grain of salt. While some of the information written was useful at the time it went to press, the web is so dynamic that a lot of the information is outdated now. In the end, I am not so sure that the authors truly tell you how to launch a business on the web. The authors spend way too much time on web netiquette, Marketing 101, and the minutia of the net - the global goal seems lost at times."
1,"If you liked this, you'll love...","Neil Diamond's AS TIME GOES BY movie set. Or Donny Osmond's LOVE SONGS OF THE 1970S. Or Barry Manilow's GREATEST SONGS OF THE 1960S. Or Barry Manilow's GREATEST SONGS OF THE 1970S. This album has ""Feelings.""If you're an avid GC fan, this package, CD #2, has 18 cover songs. More or less along the style lines of the above mentioned albums. CD#1 is more or less many Capitol hits, and about an equal helping of album filler tracks from the period."
3,OK CD,"This CD is good - not the best, but good! A little more variety of selections would be very welcome!"
3,listen before buying,"Ronan Keating was great in Boyzone. Unfortunately, his solo effort lacks much the hitmaking magic of Boyzone. Tracks 1-7 are solid, the last 6 feel uninspired and are quite frankly, a waste of space> The stand out track is ""Life is a rollercoaster,""however,this cd breaks halfway through the ride. If possible, listen before buying."
1,absolutely preposterous!,"I wonder if schizophrenia is a correct diagnosis for this woman, it sounds more like a personality disorder. Schizophrenia is a REAL brain dysfunction that up to now, doesn't have a ""cure"" and medications help some symptoms but the illness doesn't go away. It is irresponsible of a physician to attribute his sessions ""curative"" powers without any clear methodology. Pharmacotherapy is not about drug companies, is about quality of life, I wonder who can wait 20 years and see someone 6 days a week to ""improve"". Again I doubt this person had schizophrenia."
3,not a 5-star book,There are about 600 activities in the book instead of 2000 as the titile suggested. Most of the activities are just common sense. I don't know why the book received all 5-star reviews.
1,Heavily edited.,This was probably a great movie at one time. The version I received was so edited it was hard to watch.
3,"Don't just rent, unless you're a quick learner!","I rented this item for a week and found that I didn't get the tab and access to the online support that one gets when you BUY the video. That said, if you're a real quick learner and have lots of time in that first week to play and practice...a rental may be the right choice. The video itself is very good. The instructor is clear and doesn't treat the viewer like an idiot. He shows the techniques clearly then moves right along, which is good if you want to go back and review the disk every now and then. All in all a very good video, just be careful how you order. The Amazon Unbox thing can be a little confusing if you don't understand the usage you're paying for."
3,Uni. Soldier,"This movie was okay. Full of action, and Freezer burn! Not much I can say about this movie,but a little disapponited with the out come!"
2,Lacklustre,"I was looking forward to watching this film because of the cast billing (Jean-Claude Van Damme, Dolph Lundgren and Andrei Arlovski)and the high publicity it received. That changed when I actually saw the entire film. As with all of Jean's and Dolph's movies you get a lot of rock-em sock-em action and this one did not disappoint in that aspect. What was disappointing was that there were barely any speaking parts for the main stars, just monosyllabic responses to questions asked by the supporting cast. Dolph's character did not appear until the last quarter of the movie. So, if you want a modern day silent film (ahem) with lots of martial killing then you will enjoy this film. I simply did not!"
5,Excellent sequel!,"I'm usually not a fan of sequels, especially after watching Universal Soldier The Return. However this rendition is easily more entertaining than previous films. Both Van Damme and Andrei Arlovski were fantastic in this film; infact I felt Arlovski had better screen presences than Dolph Lundgren. The action and fight scenes in this film are easily on par with any high budget action film. Unlike a lot of the straight DVD action movies out there, the fight choreography in this film was close to perfect. The director wisely used wide angle lenses during the action scenes giving U.S.R a raw, realistic feel throughout the film. Unlike a lot of Van Dammes previous direct to DVD releases this film delivers."
5,Still got it,Not the best album by B.G. aka B-Gizzle the #1 Original Hot Boy still reppin New Orleans while some of the other Cash Money members have moved out our City and turned their back on the streets of New Orleans - BG still goes in head first as always. He shows his talent either on or off drugs and almost everyone can relate to his music. He is the realest rapper out of New Orleans since RIP Soulja Slim passed away. The only thing that could make his music better is if Soulja Slim was still alive to colab with him. 4.8/5 stars - although I prefer Chopper City in the Ghetto I love this album.
2,Wooden pieces do not fit together securely,"I wanted to love this toy but I am sorely disappointed with the quality. I spent an hour putting the ship together but was immediately concerned that the wooden pieces barely snapped together and the crows nest just sits on the mast as well as well as the pirate flag and all sails fall off with even delicate play. I contacted Ryan's Room as this is the 1st time I bought one of their products weeks ago and I have yet to hear anything back from the company. I just expect when you pay for a quality wooden toy that you get quality. I have glued many of the pieces together with wood glue and it still fails to secure the ship parts. Having said all that, my son does play with the ship and love it and isn't as bothered as I thought he would be with the collapsable pieces.If I had known the design of this ship I probably would have gone with a company like Plan Toys or Melissa and Doug or HABA."
5,SICK AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!,these things are sick fun! i got one for xmas and the only thing i do outside! They aren't that hard to ride. I've fallen only three times on a crack filled driveway. The best way to spend a day!Ps. I might do a video review with some footage of me riding.
5,great gift,i bought this ripstick for my son for xmas and he loves it. it's heavy and sturdy and i know it will have many miles on it
5,Amazing!,This was one of the best gifts that we ever bought for our 14 year old son. He loves it and rides it several hours a day. His abs are quite ripped now too! :-) It only took him a couple of days to get the hang of it and he has had it for a month and a half and can do tricks now.
5,Great product!,"Bought this for my son last year - it was a requested item. It took him a day or two to figure out how ride it, but not nearly as long I thought it would. He loves it, rides it all the time when he's outside. It's obviously harder than a skate-board, but apparently not too hard for middle-school set to figure out. It's very durable, like I said he's ridden it almost every day for a year now with no problems. It's good exercise and good for coordination. My only concern is making sure he has a helmet on when he uses it. Otherwise - highly recommended!"
5,Fun for all ages,"I bought this as a gift for my 31 year old husband, because my 28 year old brother got one! Aren't these just for teenagers?! I guess not, because every weekend the two of them get together and go down the street on these things for hours. Luckily, no injuries yet.It's harder than a skateboard, but they seem to have picked up the basics pretty quickly (though both are athletic in general). Definitely watch the short (10 minute) instruction video that comes in the box, you will need it to know how to get on the ripstick, as that poses the greatest challenge for some! Have fun!"
5,"Kids love it , great way to keep them active.","Really not much to say. Your kid will not be disappointed. Its a very well made product, delivers on every level.My daughter wanted the lime green one, and the local in store choices were either Red or Blue. Hence went with Amazon. And as a customer you will already know that there are very few things that Amazon doesnt do well when it comes to online shopping.All in all, a very satisfied customer."
4,ripstik caster board,Got it for a Christmas gift and my nephew totally loves it. Better than I thought. Already recommended to friends.
4,Ripstik'n Fun,"This was purchased for my teenage son. He absolutely loves it. It provides good healthy entertainment, while getting exercise. Was well worth the purchase !"
5,Very Nice,The RipStik is very pleasing to look at as well as fun to play on. My 12 year old LOVES it!
4,Anyone can learn,"I bought this for my 7 year old for Christmas. We were very sceptical, because he has never ridden a skateboard, can't skate and is not that co-ordinated. But thats what he wanted so we got it. We made sure he was fully padded up and took him to try it out. Now here is the secret. PARENTS MUST help them for the first couple of days, by supporting them. My son held both hands on day one, one on day two, and by day three he was off and running. Imagine my surprise that by day four he was wizzing around everywhere completly unaided. So in short parents, be prepared to be running up and down the street with your child for half an a hour a day for say three or four days, so that they don't give up."
5,They loved it.,My nieces and nephews got this from me as a Christmas gift. They love it. They ride it all the time and it is really sturdy.
2,Not for the inexperienced,"Unfortunately as a parent, I should have done more research on this product. My son has no experience with skateboards, let alone a ripstik. He used it once, fell off and had to go to the ER. Ended up selling the ripstik within a week after Xmas. Anyone considering buying this for their child, be sure to find out more on this on the internet and others experience. The ripstik only has two wheels."
5,PURE FUN,"This amazing board is not just for kids. My friends and I, all of whom are over 20, just opened this up today and haven't put it down since! As avid snowboarders, we are always looking for ways to emulate snowboarding in the warmer months, and we have definitely found it with the Ripstik. Although it does take a little getting used to, it is extremely fun to ride, and makes you feel like you're floating. The carving and steering motions are exactly like snowboarding. This product is worth every pennie. I strongly recommend it to anyone and everyone!"
2,The trouble with formulaic writing,"First of all, let me say that I don't *completely* hate the Berenstain Bears books, despite the frequency with which I have to read them. A lot of them have provided launching points for productive conversations with my kids.This one, however...what the heck? I agree with the reviewer who mentioned that it goes a bit too far. The poop on the floor just is...bizarre. And it isn't just one picture of it; it appears in the book three separate times. There are also two kind of crazy drawings of Mama Bear where she just looks like she has completely given up on life (although if I were married to a lout like Papa Bear I might give up, too).There are definitely better ways to get the message to kids that it's not OK to let the chores slide. Piles of poop with stink lines coming off of them are really not necessary."
5,Fascinating!,"Escape 2 Earth is a book that resonates as we approach 2012, and, as many fear, the realization of an apocalyptic vision--the destruction of Earth. What if saving humanity was not in the hands of God, but of Man? Or, Men? Matt, Will, and Art are drawn into a cosmic battle for the survival of humans and the Earth that draws on the predictions of history and the technology of the future. Will they succeed in saving their own lives--and those of us all? Read this thrilling page-turner and find out! Highly recommended!"
1,No,"It's just a philosophy graduate student complaining that the world of English literary theory isn't grounded in the rigorous confines of philosophy. He even prepared an eerily meticulous little outline for us throughout the entire book, with little subheads alerting us to counter-arguments and such. It starts to get vaguely interesting when he puts down different literary theorists, until you realize all of this has been said before.ALSO make sure you know that this is self-published with a blurry photo of the author not even looking at the camera--it could actually be almost anyone--with no quotes from reviews. The high price must be due to the fact that it's self-published through iUniverse."
4,diving into warm water,"This album is still taking me far, far away and I've heard it hundreds of times. This is ""elegant"" music by all means that has the power of submerge you effortless into a beautiful and soft universe.After over-listening to Air, Carboot Soul, Fila Brazilia, Massive Attack and other great down-tempo music this album felt completly unique and refreshing.Buy it whithout a doubt and dive into warm water."
4,Deadpan perspective and impeccable language,"Hailed as 'one of the most charming voices since Holden Caulfield', Burton Rembrand is the eight year old hero of this unusual and occasionally bewildering narrative of love, loyalty and the injustice inherent in not being understood by the adult world.Burton tries to express his feelings for another girl his age and is thrown into an institution for disturbed children for his troubles. His deadpan perspective and impeccable language -he is, after all, the spelling champion of his grade- carry the novel though the flashbacks gradually constructing the events which led to him being locked up. He is no madder than you or I, merely puzzled and frequently driven to tantrums by his situation and its restrictions; he makes sense of it all by writing his story on the walls of the 'quiet room', his sanctuary from patronising adults with only his best interests in mind."
5,Fabulous!,"Our daughter, adopted in Korea, was born without part of her left arm/hand and she loves this book. The first time I showed it to her, when she was only 2-1/2, she said ""Just like me!"" A must-have for any parent of a child with this type of condition."
4,Its nice to know so many GITMO personnel buy books!,"After reading the reviews, I was very suprised at the number of former/current GITMO personel that buy and review books on amazon.com This is truly an untapped market! Evidently this is the ONLY book being read at GITMO, since they have never reviewed anything else on amazon.com Ok, Im finished with the sarcasm.The book was an easy read. The details were disturbing. Is it fact/fiction? Its up the reader to decide. Unfortunately we dont have any nice digtal photos floating around on the internet to verfiy the author's account.Many are quick to dismiss his version of events. But then again, if someone had written a book about soldiers in Iraq leading detainees around on leases, making them masterbate, stacking them naked in a pyramid...I would be inclined to think it was fiction too. Now if only we could find some photos from GITMO."
3,Not what some may be looking for.,"I ordered this book after watching the HBO documentary, ""Taxi to the Darkside"", which discusses the human rights violations in Abu Ghraib and GITMO. I had hoped that this book would be more of a tell-all expose' that would shed more light on the torture and treatment of the supposed terrorists being held there. Instead I found a somewhat light-hearted book about general day to day life of an intel soldier at a military prison. It was so light-hearted in some areas that it even made me wonder if what he was saying was true or was he also trying to cover up some of the negative aspects of the prison. His time spent in interrogations was very limited and he had no access to some of the most valuable and interesting inmates being held there. On the other hand I did not feel like I wasted my money on the book because it was very well written and although it wasn't what I was looking for I did find it to be a genuine interesting book that I read from cover to cover."
1,"Saar is a liar, and not a very good one at that.","I would like to state for the record that I worked with Erik R. Saar during his time at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.I can say without hesitation that Erik did not translate for the incident he talked about on 60 minutes, nor did he witness any of the interrogations he wrote about in his book. Because of his limited skills in the Arabic language, he was kept behind a desk doing paperwork.It is apparent from reading his book, Erik is trying to make a fast buck on the so-called stories that were always going around amongst the Interrogators. Yes Erik, they were just stories that were made up to entertain folks.I think a better book for reading would be the one that someone should write about you Erik, and how you have pulled the wool over the eyes of the world.Erik is not only a poor Arabic Linguist, he is also a liar.Erik, shame on you Brother. The only true fact in your whole book is that you were indeed at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba for a very short time."
1,Do Not Buy This Item,This item has a malfunctioning vaccum system. The sealer works as promised but the vaccum system is non existant. Customer service is lowsy. You have to pay to return the item and have the replacement sent back to you.
4,Cute film,"I would consider this another guilty pleasure rom-com.Only reason I initially was curious about it was because of #AL but J'lo does a good job,considering some of her works(Gigli ha!)Who knew?! I recommend."
1,Horrible!!!!!,"Do not buy this movie if you liked wedding planner or monster n law, this is nothing like it and its not even funny..very upset about this one j-lo!"
5,The Back-Up Plan [Blu-ray],"I received this movie very fast from the seller, it was Used/Like New. Great deal and in terrific like new condition. I love the movie!! A super cute romantic comedy. Highly recommended :)"
3,Unfulfilled Potential,"I am going to be short and to the point. This movie had a lot of potential and a good storyline that was different from most. I realize that it is a romantic comedy with slapstick ways which produced a few crude but hilarious moments. However, as a ""romantic comedy"" there were raucus moments that in my opinion were too disgusting for the genre. The whole single mother's club giving birth to a baby in the pool scene was almost enough for me to stop watching the movie. It was that disgusting! What were the writers thinking? They went way overboard, thus ruining an otherwise good but different concept of a movie. IMHO"
5,SOO FUNNY!!,I LOVE THIS CUTE FILM. IT IS ROMANTIC BUT SOO FUNNY. IM NOT ONE FOR MUSHY OR SAPPY MOVIES AND I THOUGHT WHEN I GOT STUCK WATCHING THIS WITH MY SISTER I WAS GOING TO HATE IT. I LOVED THE MOVIE SO MUCH I BOUGHT IT...LOTS OF LAUGHS!
2,More 'Aero' Than 'Practical Techniques',"I bought this and Martin Simons' 'Model Aircraft Aerodynamics' at the same time, thinking that I'd have all the bases covered: Simons for aero, Lennon for construction techniques. Silly me. Why would I think a book entitled 'Practical Techniques for Building Better Models' would have anything to do with construction?The reality is that both books cover the same topic: aerodynamic design. In my opinion, the Simons book does a better job."
5,There are not eonough stars in the galaxy to rate this book,I especially loved the portrayal of meidevil life and the search for the meaning of what it means to be an artist and what art is all about. How artist take a differrent path to perection and understanding. Unplug the gadgets and read this.
3,"The previous reviews are right.... Great concept, though...","This one is great, until it's not.... Cool character structure and gameplay until it screws up... Not the best when it came out and probably worse now that the systems are more advanced. Some things just don't stand the test of time...."
2,Zorjirushi Air Pot - Issues with longevity,"This is a good quality pump-style thermos. My only addition to the other reviews is that the pot is not designed for use with dairy or juice products. Once I saw the no dairy/no juice warning, a quick call to Zojirushi revealed that the pump mechanism may not be able to be cleaned thoroughly enough to remove traces of these easily spoiling liquids. Since I wanted to use this for hot chocolate -- as well as coffee -- this may not have been the best choice for me. Otherwise, I am thoroughly satisfied with the quality and performance of the air pot.60 Day Addendum: With only 4 uses, the pump mechanism has failed. It won't get enough suction to pull liquid up. I'll be able to replace the pump unit, but it seems like the quality isn't what I first suspected. Hence, I have changed the rating from 4 to 2 stars."
5,This is the very best airpot ever!!!,"This is by far, the very best airpot we have ever owned. I make coffee at 7:00 a.m., and the coffee is stll warm at 6:00 p.m. Prior to owning this airpot, we'd have to reheat the coffee in our airpot by noon or 1:00 p.m. It stays even hotter if you pre-heat it with hot water. I don't think there's a better airpot on the market today!"
2,Returning the item -- Daily cleaning instructions too much!,We never tried the product. Just could not get past the very long list of daily cleaning steps. This was going to be used for my husband who is at work at home employee and for when we had people over for coffee. I don't have 15+ minutes a day to clean this item!
2,Good product...horrible battery,"I loved hooking this up to the DVR station and using it to record TVs shows and movies to watch on the airplane. Portable Wi-Fi access is also great. But after using it for a year, the battery is worthless. From a fresh charge, I only get 10 minutes. Very disappointed."
2,not happy,First thing I like to mention is who pay who off. The review stated that u get 15 plus hrs of audio play. Not.... I am luck to get 8 hrs. Battery life is really sorry. I have not try placing any video on yet... I am totally disappointed in the system. Trying to sync music is adventure in itself. The system occasion freeze up for no apparent reason. It sounds good; the build in speaker system is very good. I don't feel that I will every buys an Archo product again
5,WOW! FORGET IPOD! BUY ARCHOS NOW!,This will free you from the HORROR of IPOD & APPLE once and for all!LIGHTENING FAST shipping! Perfect Transaction! Great items! Thank You!
3,Great screen nice features but.......,"Great screen, seems hard to scratch.Would like the docking station and remote to work better.needs a skip feature to fast forward movies.Sound quality truely SUCKS. Such a nice built product but the sound quality on the low end is off 200hz and below. The sound level is too low even at the highest settings. I'm going to RMA it when I get time.Don't buy the car adaptor as it doesn't work on this model."
3,average,"My main gripe with this player is the fact that the lock button doesn't work very well. I use it to conserve battery by preventing the screen from lighting up every time I accidentally touch the screen. Yet it displays a message that says ""buttons are locked."" I categorize this as useless and defeats the whole purpose, especially since if I keep pressing the screen, the lock function disables. This is incredibly annoying because battery drains within 3 hours if this keeps happening. So you either have to put it in a container that suspends it wherever you move, or you have to not move it at all. Highly inconvenient. I would've just bought another Zen Vision M if I knew about this.The screen is gorgeous and huge, reading e-books and watching videos that you can get to work on it without buying the 2 add-ons is awesome, but the sound output isn't loud. If I have my Zen at the level I keep this one at, I would move lickety split towards hard of hearing."
4,One of the better Westerns,"This little known classic, staring Charles Bronson and directed by Terence Young, is one of the better Westerns of all time. With an interesting plot that entangles a Japanese Samurai warrior and an American outlaw in their quest to retrieve a stolen ceremonial sword, it has clever twists and even a nice touch of humor, the only downside being the acting of Ursula Andress, whose performance cannot entirely be overshadowed by her physical attributes!All in all, if you have a multi-region player, this movie is definitely worth watching."
4,Excellent but not perfect.,Is it me or shouldnt they have owner mode and create your own team.Other than that the game is hot.specially wit the all star weekend added.the graphics is hot 2.
5,THIS GAME SOUNDS AWESOME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I LOOKED AT ALL THE REVIEWS AND IT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD GAME.I JUST WATCHED IT ON TV AND THE DUNK CONTEST SOUNDS aw e some !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Don't buy this game,"I have been a loyal player of the EA sports NHL series for 12 years. Don't waste your money on this one. They have changed the menues, taken away the create a player function, screwed up the controls and I am sure there is more. They game play is no improvement from 2004, in fact it seems to be a step back. 2004 Is a much better game. I am uninstalling the game and writing it off as a $45.00 lesson. My point, read the reviews first."
1,Disapointing,"After NHL 2004 I was excited about playing the new one, but after I rented it I was wrong on how good this game would be. The controls are fairly simple,but trying to score is another story. You get checked WAY TOO OFTEN and it's almost impposible to score at least one goal. This game for me was a dissapointment and I hope NHL 2006 will be fairly better just like NHL 2004."
3,"hey look, its nhl 2001 all over again","every year since 2001, ea has been putting out the same game over and over again. this game looks to be no different. sure there are new intros, cut scenes, and goal celebrations, but the gameplay looks exactley the same. dull and completely non-challenging. they give you the ""big deke"" button that, when you use it, makes the defender freeze up everytime and everytime you just blow right by. ea needs to take a look at espn and take notes. espn has been putting out an increasingly better game every year. they work with last years game and improve what needed improving. ea just keeps adding flash and pizzaz to a bland playing game.to the reviewer who claims to be a hockey enthusiast and says espn is unrealistic, bollocks. when have you seen an nhl game where the final was 12-0?"
1,Poor replacement grate,I ordered these grill grates as replacements for my grill.They are not exact replacements and are smaller in diameter and fit loosely in the grill. They warp under high heat. Not what I expected and paid for. Not heavy duty as my grill was supplied with. :-(
5,Can't wat for Season 4,"I wasn't impressed with the first 2 episodes I saw of 30 Rock. 3 seasons and hours of watching later, and I can't wait for the next season. It's simplistically comical and an altogether solid tv show."
4,Good Refference,This is a good quick reference guide & has has a good collection of species & varieties. You couldn't raise any fish from the information in this book - but it certainly makes choosing those right for you aquarium a little easier.
3,Excellent photos & fish descriptions but lacking other info,"I found the book to be eye-catching, and informative about the specific physical descriptions.However, I find that much of what I'm looking for isn't in the book-- specifics on water condition needs, behaviors and other details that seem to be included in a number of other aquarium books.I bought this book nearly a year ago and I'm now back shopping for something a bit more satisfactory to my needs in the way of specifics on the fish.Also, it is sometimes very scanty on other specifics-- such as diseases. For instance, it doesn't even mention ""shims"" or ""shimmying"" which has several causes, one being that the fish has gotten chilled, and other causes as well that are more disease-oriented. One-quarter page of one-line descriptions on diseases without any suggestions on treatment just doesn't qualify as an adequate, all-around aquarium book to me."
4,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"OneAgainstFive is a really great band that has a bunch of different styles. They remind me of 311 because they mix different culture and style into their songs. If you are into Sublime, Bob Marley, 311, all of the above, this CD is a MUST! They are a great Seattle band and they have awsome live performances. Buy the CD and see for yourself."
4,Great at keeping coffee hot for hours. Only Worry: No Warranty,"Really, it works beautifully, and keeps coffee hot for many hours. And it seems very well constructed.My only concern is that if it ever loses its vacuum seal (as I saw happened to one buyer whose review appears here), one now has a fancy paperweight - since there is apparently NO manufacturer's warranty on the product!"
1,Disappointing,"It seems my original review contravened the Conditions of Use. Too strong and then some I suppose.Suffice it to say, I found 23 DAYS disappointing (an understatement). In short, and shorn of my stronger and more strongly-expressed opinions, if you read Lance's BIKE and Daniel Coyle's LANCE ARMSTRONG'S WAR you'll go farther and deeper than offered in 23 DAYS. You will leave the BIKE+WAR reading experience far more informed and more involved in the inner workings of professional cycling.Dr. Kirtland Peterson"
4,They did it again!,"Once again Gotthard releases another quality product for the rocker in all of us.It's a shame that no one outside of Europe hears about these guys,but maybe that will change,if only people will give it a chance.Next to Lipservice,this may be their finest hour.Buy it already."
3,fair condition,"banged up book, but worth the price!Book not described very welli will not order from this vender again"
2,No Caller ID,"I was disapointed w/ this purchase. The phone does not have caller ID, which I should have seen from the description. However, when I contacted the seller to return the item, I was told I had to pay shipping, PLUS a restocking fee. I ended up giving it away as a ""white elephant"" gift."
5,Feels solid and fits.,"This ring is cheap, fits, is made of aluminum, and gets the job done. There's just not much else to ask of it."
2,Big but not strong enough,My daughter chewed the one from the hospital so I order this one. I saw a friend of my has 3oz. big like this one so I order this. But I was so disappointed bc it not suck strong enough like the naval brand from the hospital. I had ordered 2 oz. From Mabis/DMI First Aid is work excellent.
1,diappointed,The knife is dull. It was not useful in deboning 15 chicken breasts I was preparing for canning.Very disappointing!
2,look elsewhere,This is a nice looking knife with a nice handle.Thin flexible blade.Fits the hand nicely and is well balanced but bottom line it disappointed me in the sharpness category.The initial edge wasn't evenly honed on both sides and was what I would consider dull.It required major honing to get it almost razor sharp but there are cheaper stamped knifes I have that will take a better edge. If it was less than $20 it would be a passable knife but at $30 there's better out there even at the $20 and below mark.My opinion is look elsewhere if you want a sharp stamped boning knife.Though it isn't a bad knife for someone with sharpening skills.
5,Unique and Comprehensive,"In this book, the author reviews the vocal and sound-healing techniques of a variety of master practitioners. It is a most in-depth look at a very elusive but valuable aspect of music therapy and performance training. It should be of interest to music educators, music therapists, public speakers, and anyone who needs to become more aware of how to use a voice effectively and authentically, or coach others to do so."
2,DISAPPOINTED BY SONY,"I usually swear by SONY products, but this time I'm extremelly disappointed. My husband gave me this mp3 player as a gift, paid over $400 when it first came out. The design is OK, but the SONICSTAGE software is horrible and buggie, like the other guy said - it freezes, crashes for no reason, the transfer and compressing the files into ATRAC format compromises quality and a lot of times causes clicking and noisy static music. this product sucks and i want to shoot it."
3,One of the most interesting books I've ever read,"Someone recommended this book to me, knowing about my interest in the Prohibition. I must say I was a bit disappointed with the quality of the writing. I am not exactly an expert, but I found more than a respectable number of grammatical errors.As far as the plot goes, it was very exciting. I was never bored and I liked the way Buti described the events. He has a skill for imagry if not for spelling. However, it was just a bit jumbled and hard to follow. Perhaps a few more revisions would have really helped improve the quality of the book."
4,necessitas vincit legem,"stream of consciousness style. a deeply personal worldview darkly colored by grief and self-loathing, yet leavened by a humor born of despair. a notable character study of a clinically depressed prosecutor. classy."
4,Noirish and Lyrical,"This first novel has style to burn. It's a story of a more or less alcoholic Brooklyn prosecutor hardened by regrettable circumstances in his personal and professional life. Brooklyn is a haunted and haunting setting. The D.A.'s office is realistic (it's the old office actually; the present KCDA now has much nicer digs), as is the dusty, old, sad routine of the criminal courts. The first-person narrative is handled deftly with a kind of parenthetical stream-of-concsiousness technique that shows how even first-person narrators can lie to themselves. I seldom give away stories in my reviews and I'll not break that rule here. Suffice it to say that, even though this story has been told before, it's well-told here, and provides the occasion for the arrival of a welcome new voice. This novel is a good example of the unique capacity of genre-fiction as a formal ground for the display of remarkable talent."
5,The Ultimate Golf Game,"Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 2005 is the ultimate golf game of the year. For many years I have had Links 2003, but going from that to this is a huge step forward. This game takes sometime to get used to all of the controls, and also gets harder has you get on to pass the legends tour, where you play with legends such as Arnold Palmer, Ben Hogan, Seve Ballesteros, and the legendary Gary Player. While you play tournaments you win money so you can improve your equipment to the best name brands including Callaway Golf, Nike, TaylorMade, and everything else known. You also get to customize your appereance including face, nose, lips, everything. And get to pick from clothes, shoes, hats, watches, etc. This makes the game funner so you can get sponsered by different name brands if you where and use their equipment. This gave is very hot on the market I would grab your copy very fast. This is the best!!"
5,"SUPER soft, adorable and perfect!","Did not want a ""typical"" black and white penguin and this guy/gal fills the bill perfectly. It is ULTRA-SOFT fabric, and firmly yet squishy-stuffed. PERFECT! This is a great line of products, and my first exposure to it - will be looking to Wild Republic and this extra-soft line more often!"
2,WEP200,"On the upside WEP200 has a great battery life time, but, on the downside its sounds like the person you are speaking with is in a tunnel. Also, the person you are talking to has a very hard time understanding what the user is trying to say. I have a Samsung A900 cellphone and am very pleased with that so I expected that same type of quality from their bluetooth headset. Was I disappointed. Maybe you'll have a better experience with it. Good luck"
2,Red Wep,"I originally had the black wep, which worked fine. I upgraded to the red sync from cingular and wanted the red wep. Everyone I spoke to told me I sounded like I was in a tunnel, could never hear me, which wasn't an overall good experience. Cute in color, small and useful, but no one could hear me clearly when I was on it."
2,feeder tube,This was a replacement for one that I had broken on my hummingbird feeder. It was not as tight so I put putty around the stopper to make a seal. It drips if I do not fill the feeder completely and turn it over quickly this is the only trick I have found that stops leaks.
3,They fit well!,The hummingbird feeder plugs work well for the bottles that I use to feed them.I have been looking for them awhile and then....I found them! Awesome!
2,Hummer feeder tubes,"No matter the size or type of bottle these feeders were put on, the sugar water continues to drip out. We thought we had a real find here, but very disappointing."
2,My grandson was not impressed,I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my 10 year old grandson. He did not care for the rubber stick arrows. H had different expectations from the product.
2,Outrageous Price for a So-So product,"When Jergens first came out with a shave minimizing lotion it worked great for me. After using it for a month I didn't have to shave my legs for a whole month after that. Then they changed the formula and it didn't work very well.This seller is offering less than 10 oz. for almost $40, including shipping. That is way overpriced for this product."
3,A little disappointed,I don't think this airport keeps the coffee very hot unless it is filled to the brim each time. It takes almost 20 cups to fill to the top. Maybe I should have looked for a smaller version.
2,Very pretty Gas Stove,"I've owned this grill for over a year now and had plenty of opportunity to use it, my conclusion: Don't confuse this with a barbecue grill. Despite the pictures used in the advertising, it doesn't work well for hot dogs, hamburgers, or steak - a ten dollar charcoal pan will produce a taster meal, be easier to clean up, easier to store, and cost way less money. This works better if you buy the wire grates and use it like a gas stove.It's heavy, setup and teardown are not that easy and are best done with two people - it has a tendency to collapse into a noisy heap during setup/teardown or if you try to move it after set up since the legs don't lock in to place when it's raised. The lid doesn't lock down either - there is a latch but it is so loose it flops back and forth.A sharp looking grill, but my old Colman two burner camp stove and folding camp cook table are more useful, easier to set up, and easier stow."
1,JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THESE NEED TO BE RECALLED,"I purchased this grille on 4/09/2012 and finally got a chance to use it on 5/16/2012 (AFTER AMAZON'S LOUSY RETURN WINDOW for this item). When I assembled it and tried to fire it up, only one of the piezo's would light the burner, checked all gaps and they were correct, turns out the one burner was NOT grounded. Upon further inspection 3 rivets were missing and one broken off of the underside framework. This unit on LOW will char hamburger patties in a minute and the patties in the center of the grille will hardly cook at all. The grille's are impossible to clean and if they are ceramic coated I couldn't find any. IMHO Coleman is riding their name to the max as this thing is only fit for the scrap pile. I'm done with coleman products - period. I was screwed last fall also when 3 of their lantern glasses shattered without cause or warning and of course they wouldn't stand behind that either."
1,Not crazy about this,I am disappointed with this product. It is more like cooking on a stove rather than a grill. The grease splatters all over and then drips down to the bottom. There are no coils like most grills there are two burners so the food in the middle doesn't cook. It is a real disappointment. Last yer I had a $30 grill from Walmart that worked better.Shipping. Was great
2,NOT FOR TABLETOP USE,"I haven't used the grill yet, however, I am already disapointed. I purchased to use as both a tabletop grill at home as well as while on the road in an RV. The description states that, ""If table top use is desired - simply hand remove the 4 plastic cap screws and start cooking!"" This is not possible with this grill. There are no screws to be removed that would allow removal of the leg stand assembly. Even if it were removed could not sit on a table or on anything else. Rather than go through the return process I will find another for home use."
3,BE CAREFUL,"I had this grill for about a year, and it was great. i cooked on it all the time over the summer, and i usally use it all year round. It is a great grill , cooks well, and very easy to use / transport. It however is not easy to clean, the grill lock sucks, when moving it will the grates in there everything falls out, and the handle fell off and burned me(the plastic handle melted, way to think this threw coleman). Good thing there is that 5 year service. Well all in all they are going to replace it BUT it takes 4-6 weeks(10weeks) to get the grill, and i am sure it is going to just break again.... buy it if u dont use it daily. Do not cook too long on it, dont cook with grill top down."
2,Unhappy,"After I purchased this unit, I learned that I was NOT able to cook with grill cover closed. This information was written in very small print on the back of the grill which I discovered after I assembled the product.I am very disappointed with the engineering design of this unit and I wish I would have purchased a small, compact Weber grill."
1,BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"There are 2 pieces in the gas tube that goes from flame control knob to burner. The section that goes from control knob to burner tube is smaller and should be INSIDE of burner tube to ensure steady, complete gas flow. When I first started my grill,, I could not keep the flame going and it was a very low flame. I disassmebled the grill to look at the controls and gas feed tubes. There was a 1/2 inch gap between the tubes on BOTH burners.. Obviously a factory assembly flaw and, needless to say, a severe safety issue. For the price Coleman is asking, perhaps they should get their Chinese Quality Control folks on this immediately!"
3,"Almost perfect, but odd burner arrangement","Thought this would be ideal for use with our camping trailer, but didn't like the design of the grill plates or the burners. They grill is not open with slats like most grills, but have a round solid center section over the round burners. The use of round burners in a grill like this, rather than length-wise doesn't seem like the best design. It requires one to keep juggling the meat around to get enough heat to sear, but not too much. I found that annoying.Aside from the above, the design and construction is excellent. Very well made with may ingenious features: grease trap, sliding tables, wheels for moving, optional griddles (I really liked those), etc."
3,just so so,grill is ok. best part of this grill is that it is mobile. you can take it with you to the lake side and move it around when there is rain whatever. but a bit small. wish volume could be bigger. nice product overall
2,Not Happy With Grill,"I read most all the reviews before purchasing this grill. It does assemble well ,my 5 year old nephew assisted me and he had a couple things figured out before I read the instructions on how to do it. It is sturdy and folds up and down with all the ease mentioned in the other reviews.However, it cooks to fast even on low heat. I believe it is because the grill plate sits to close to the flame. Juices from the meat drips down onto the bottom and flames up. It is a pain to have to clean. Had I used it just after I purchased it instead of waiting months, I would have returned it.I also purchased the grill cover and it IS NOT rain/water proof."
4,A Good Cooking Grill,"We like our Coleman grill a lot. It is easy to operate and turns out very good food. Our only complaints are that the grease tray is hard to pull in and out and it didn't come with an attachment to hold a match in case you need that to light the fire. I don't know if this was an accessory or if it was to come with the grill, but it was shown in the picture of the grill. Overall, I would certainly recommend it to anyone."
4,can get too hot,"This is my first gas grill and Ive just had this for a few months, its pretty good but can get too hot. I like the idea of being portable and me and my friends are planning to use it on the beach this july 4th."
1,Pass on this grill...,"This grill is poorly designed and difficult to move for a portable grill.The burners are way too close to the cooking surface, which burns pretty much everything, but leave the middle raw.The wheels do not allow for the user to move the grill easily, and the thing weighs a ton, so it is even difficult to pick up and move it.Normally Coleman stuff is pretty good and user friendly, but not this. Don't waste your money as I did on this grill."
4,great but clumsy,"I bought it at Camping World on sale for about $160. Used it twice - once to cook tri-tip, and once to cook baby back spare ribs. Food turned out excellent.Although definitely portable, it is a bit heavy and very clumsy to carry, setup, and takedown. Once used, the inside becomes crusted with grease and bad things that tend to get on your clothing during takedown or when carrying the BBQ.There is an optional carrybag, about $36 per www.coleman.com, but I have not been able to find it locally. This may be what is needed for this to be a truly useful device, but that then brings the total cost to about $200. A lot for a portable grill."
1,Bad Grill,This is the worst grill I have ever owned.......it burns everything.....it is impossible to slow grill anything.....with this grill you have two choices between a little burnt and a lot burnt.......you would do better with a $20 grill......do not waste your money on this grill
2,Coleman Grill,"Decent grill, not exactly user friendly. Difficult to collapse, rounded cover limits amount of food you can put on it. If I had to make a second decision with the info I know now, I would have gone with a different choice."
1,it was broke not happy,The grill was broke when i got it so i wasnt happy so it got sent back ! Wasnt happy that I had to use a small gas tank not my big one also.
2,NOT HAPPY,"First, I was mislead. I also thought it came with the griddle.Then the handle melted off AND IT DID BURN ME!!Next time I will read the comments before I buy something! DUH!"
3,Roadtrip Grill LXE,"Works OK. Left burner puts out less heat than right at High setting , made grilling vegetables a time consuming task. Side tables are small and flimsy. Is very easy to move around."
5,Another Reiner Masterpiece!!,"Fritz Reiner has done it again! I am never disappointed when I purchase one of his recordings. Respighi's Pines and Fountains of Rome are heard so often that they sometimes can be tiresome. Not so with Fritz! He manages to bring out phrasing in the orchestra that you never hear under a different baton. The performances are head and shoulders above any other I have ever heard.La Mer by Debussey gets the same treatment. While you listen, if you close your eyes you can visualize the waves crashing at sea. It is an inspiring reading.A word must be said about the splendid sound on this disc. Layton and Mohr have produced another sonic masterpiece for RCA Victor. In spite of the vintage of the recordings, they compare favorably with anything produced today! The entire series of Living Stereo with which I am familiar is recording state of the art. Thank God for this wonderful music!"
3,Watercolor Portrait Painting,"While overall I found the video helpful and instructive, the production seems amateurish and clumsy.First, the DVDs will not play on one of my DVD players. It would only work on one in a room that is not convenient for viewing or painting.Next, an enormous amount of space is wasted. When I turned on the first DVD of the set, I thought it was defective, as there was white blankness for a long time. And there are more white blank spaces between segments.There is too much focus on the artist herself. Her face is shown often and for no real reason. The focus should be on the painting and the techniques.My last complaint is the elevator music. At first it was pleasant, but quickly grew repetitive and very annoying. Silence would be preferable.The artist does a good job of explaining and demonstrating her work, and I did learn much from the DVDs. Unfortunately, the presentation is often off-putting."
4,Pretty good.,"This cd is ok. It lacks great beats,But his amazing rapping ability made up for it. I reccomend it."
1,Still haven't received it and its been over a month,I still havent received it almost a month and a half after purchase and the class i need it for starts soon. I will not ever purchase through you again.Patrick Legler
2,Why care about these people?,"The men are jerks. The women who put up with them lack even a shred of self-respect. The description of events in the 60s is interesting, but hardly interesting enough to make up for the sad characters."
4,Disturbing,"I found this book to be quite disturbing, it was well written, chock full of information and research. I never knew that before the 60's most people were never charged with child abuse most of the time, because most believed that a parent could never do that to their own child. What I found most horrific was that most of the relative's were aware of the abuse of dennis and turned a blind eye toward that evil woman, lois. And her husband Harold? what a loser! he deserved jail time for his complicity in the crime."
4,"Nice, versatile shoe","Incredibly fast, free shipping. I like the shoe a lot; perhaps it runs a bit large, but still comfortable."
4,Good Heft,"Bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift. He was looking to trick out his kilt. This is a one edged knife. A very big knife with a triangular profile. The scabbard is shaped to fit the blade. He was quite pleased with it. I was surprised by the weight and sharpness. There was a brief discussion about how it was not sharpened, then we found the edge :D - it is quite sharp."
4,good piece of metal,"arrived on time looks good mostly howvever there is a square ""blemish"" on the blade which I havent been able to polish out otherwise a good piece of metal"
3,"Not bad, but not good either.","I buy a lot of swords, Knives and I usualy buy cold steel. This blade I recived however was not up to normal Cold Steel standards. There was a gap in the glue about 1/2 long at the hilt/base, I was very disappointed at the shoddy qualty control. Please note I am not saying this not a good blade, only the one I recived was not up to my high standards. If I got a good one with a good glue job It would get 4 stars. This blade was compleatly covered with a very thick coat cosmoline to prevent rust, you may want to have a paper towel or rag handy to wipe off the excess."
5,BABIES CAN WEAR EAARINGS,"SORRY TO SAY SO, BUT THAT IS EITHER A LIE, OR YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT I AM ABOUT TO SAY. ACORDING TO IMFORMATION I GATHERED IN 2002, I SPOTTED AT LEAST 12 INFANTS (AGED 8 MONTHS - 2 YEARS) WITH PEIRCED EARS! OFCOURSE THEY DO NOT HAVE HUGE EAARINGS OR ANYTHING, JUST LITTLE EARRINGS. BUT MY THERY STILL PROVES THE PREVIOUS REVIEWER WRONG!!!!! ANYWAY ENJOY THE TOY. I KNOW I DO. ITS SITTING ON MY SHELF WILL ALL MY OTHER BABYZ STUFF."
4,good reference,Same review for issue 34 and 35. They provide a very detailed overview on older comics and their pricing. The only problem is finding anyone that you can trust and someone who will give you anywhere near that price
4,Well organized,The text was very well organized and presented clearly. The CD was not helpful. Good information for further study given at the end of the chapter.
3,"This book has great pictures, but needs more content","This book has great pictures, and the pages of it are seen all over the web. However, the performance of the exercises needed to complete his ""10 days to massive arms"" claim lack clarity. Mr. Hoeberl should get the help of a more professional writer to complete this book. His methods do work, but you're not quite sure what the method is. His biographical pieces are interesting and informative, though.Brian McDuffie,Personal Trainer,National Health Club Association"
2,OK....but...,"We bought this grill about a year ago because we liked the separate burner alongside the grill. That feature is great, but the grill side suffers. It has hot and cold spots and is difficult to clean. The wind panels on the side that support the top in a vertical position are somewhat flimsy and the attachment comes loose often. Also, if the left panel (near the burner side) is engaged, there is not much space for a pot on the burner. The igniter burned off after a few uses and I now use a lighter to light the gas rather than putting more money into this thing for a replacement igniter. All in all, after a year's use, we are going to junk this grill and try to find a decent one."
1,Where is the romance?,"This is another of those books that I could not finish. Incredibly stupid plot and poorly devloped characters. If you are reading romance novels for romance (which would be the logical idea), you will not find it in this book."
5,This is an album that lies along the classics,"Yesterday Went Too Soon is a fantastic album. It is Feeder's most satisfying album. It has some great tunes which are portrayed through tracks such as 'Yesterday Went Too Soon', 'Day in Day Out' and 'You're my evergreen'. It also has some very mellow tracks - but are still satisfying like 'Tinsel Town' and 'Radioman'. This album is different from Echo Park, it is so much more varied. If you were going to get a Feeder album, this would be the one to get first. An unbelievable album."
3,Hmmm...,"I haven't actually read this book, therefore the rating is irrelevant, but I heard the author on Art Bell's Coast to Coast radio program one night, and he sincerely believes he is the angel Daniel, and that he's travelled through time to the year 2092, where people have abandoned devastated cities due to Starburst, the setting off of several nuclear devices some 70 years earlier. Not a very pretty picture of the future. He says the worst thing about being an angel is that no one believes you. I'm a Christian and I'm loathe to give a scathing review or any kind of judgement, because Jesus did say, ""Judge not lest ye be judged."" However, to any friendly skeptics such as myself I can only say that at the very least, this sounds like a good science fiction read."
3,suicide behind bars: prediction and prevention,this is a good theme that makes prison offical work efficient.
1,Don't buy this. It's cheap and doesn't offer much protection,"The way this case is built it should be priced at $9.99, and it still would be a rip off. Look elsewhere, because the build quality is terrible and it's not worth the money. Typical bottom of the barrel cheap chinese junk here using the lowest quality stuff they can find."
5,Replacement copy,My daughter received this book as a shower present from me. My new granddaughter loved it. So much that it was pretty much worn out by the time she was a year. so this copy replaces that original one. She still loves this book--especially the peacock.
4,Review for Everything you wanted to know about Bipolar Disor,In reviewing this book after I read it I found it to be very informative and simplistic to understand for the everyday layman and how to investigate for yourself to discover if you may be Bipolar and what steps to look for and how to obtain help and what directions to take to get help. This book I would definitely recommend to the everyday person to find out what Bipolar Disorder really is.
1,Lovers of Algeria,"If I could rate this as a zero star, I would have done so. This was pretty much a waste of time, money and emotion. If the authors purpose was to see how many times he could invoke the vision of Algerians as crude, evil and heartless, I guess he was successful for whatever reasons. Looking for a ray of light in an otherwise grim tale, not in this book. The blurb writer on the book jacket makes polygraphs for blurb writers seem attractive. The constant repetition of Middle Eastern profanity was almost laughable, but did add to the word and page count. I don't even want to recycle it at our local used book sale."
1,mumble jumble,"its a lot of mumble jumble,and a lot of hocus pokus...not at all like your other books raymond."
3,Hooker babies!,Now how funny are these? I bought her as a joke with a little outfit. As an adult with a strange sense of humor I can appreciate them.Whould I get them for my 8 yo? Nope. But I don't buy regular Bratz dolls either.That being said I can appreciate the details and durability of the product when I see them. Right down to her earings and painted toenails it is well made and a good product. The dolls can sand by themselves and are nicely poseable. Trim work on the clothing along with the small designs on the shirts are impressively done. The little big had wings and funny little eyes.Just to funny. I am impressed. Well marketed and great designs. Will probably buy as a joke again. It appeales to my darker nature. Little hooker dolls. What a crack up!
4,what i think about babyz,"This doll is so cute!Ok,so if you are an adult,you might be thinking that they aren't suitable for little girls.But your little girl isn't going to think dirty things,unless you tell her!The bottle is on a chain so she can carry it round!And underwear.Um,they did't look anything like thongs!Please can people stop being paranoid?A normal six year old isn't going to think ' oh,she's got a chain to do rude things with!'Anyway,this doll is my favourite,and when i saw her i thought she was cute,not rude.thanks for listening to an 11(nearly!) year olds thoughts,Loz :)"
1,R U thinkin' that Bratz aReNt SLUTTY!?,"Not only do these new ""Babyz"" represent a newfound level of disturbing content in child's toys, but they are bringing new levels of disrespect and MTV style stupidity to young girls. This annonymus girl who keeps posting the anti-adult reviews of the Bratz line is just a living ""Brat"" and proof of what happens when we encouarge this kind of dress and lifestyle. Maybe we wouldn't have to be reviewing this toy if the Bratz had used adequade protection."
1,Advertised incorrectly,The page specifies the tube contains 4.6 ounces. When received it only contained 2.5 ounces.
2,"Good straps, but they do NOT have handles!","The description clearly says ""Velcro USA 90440 Velstrap Strap With Handle, Black"". I received the right product, Velcro brand, item 90440, but there are no handles on the straps. At under $7 (for 2 of them) they are not worth returning. They are good straps though, so I will find a use for them, just not the one I intended them for."
5,WOW!,"Well, I have to admit that I'm not a huge Diana Ross fan, infact, I haven't bought a cd of Diana's since her 1984 album with the song ""Missing You"". However, I have heard some good things about her latest album and decided to buy it. I was shocked by what I heard. She has grown so much since the last time I heard her. Her music is stronger and more lucious than ever. The songs are modern and moving. I must say...even a not so loyal Diana Ross fan will love this cd. ""Every Day Is A New Day""!"
4,A must have for any Diana Ross fan!!!!!,"Diana Ross' long anticipated release was worth the wait. Every Day Is A New Day is full of smooth ballads, mid-tempo funk and three killer dance tracks. The most noteworthy ballads are ""Love Is All That Matters"", which has potential to be a huge hit single, from the TV Movie Double Platnium and the sultry ""Until We Meet Again"". ""Got To Be Free"", ""Every Day Is A New Day"" and ""Sugarfree"" are full of mid-tempo funk and begging for radio airplay. The CD also contains a slick remake of the Martha Wash club hit ""Carry On"". Diana's vocals are in fine tune throughout this dance track. By far, the hottest track on the CD is the Hex Hector Remix of ""Until We Meet Again"". This is a pulsating dance track and is sure to be a number one dance single and a staple in clubs. Be sure to check out the ""hidden"" Love To Infinity remix of ""Until We Meet Again"" at the end of the CD."
2,THE BOSS NEEDS A LITTLE HELP...,"in her choice of material. With a name worthy of Diva status, an instantly recognizable, glorious voice and clout beyond clout this album was poised to be a smash hit. Instead, we get an album of half baked, mediocre slush. The opening track shows some promise, but after that its all down hill. A few more up tempo songs (come on, Diana you know a good disco groove when you hear one!), some better writing and a team of hot producers and this album would be great. Diana, take that diva crown and wear it like Bob Mackie ostrich feathers and sequins...not an off the rack, tasteful but bland, two piece suit."
5,The brilliance of Diana Ross,"My collection of Diana Ross music is extensive. Yes the RCA years were more pop than soul, but her latest recordin of ""Every day is a New Day"" is an examlpe of great music performed by a legendary artist. I especially enjoy listening to the third track(Until we Meet Again). Since the summer tour--RTL was canceled before it reached the MCI, in Washington, DC. This new cd has helped to to deal with my disappointment. In addition, htere is the eight track (Sugarfree)which was produced by Chuckii Booker. I would be remiss if I didn't nention track number ten (Hope Is An Open Window), the use of the literary work of Sonia Sanchez brings both a power and depth to this song. I for one do not need radio to tell me what is good music. Diana's latest video has never been played on BET (except when she received her star). Do yourself a favor, put on track number eleven and CARRY ON."
5,This CD is OFF THE HOOK!!,"Diana does it again with this cd, she has taken it to where I have never heard her take it before. She really sets it on fire with Carry On and I love both versions of Until We Meet Again and Not Over You Yet could be the song to put Miss Ross back on the map. I have no complaints other than that there should be some singles from this album being released and strike while the iron is hot."
2,Another letdown,"I keep buying her latest and always get letdown. She no longer sings with any energy, just breathy and syrupy. She needs to let someone else do the producing and get a vocal coach. Don't buy this one, just maybe the maxi-singles."
4,SUPRISINGLY ENTERTAINING,"LA ROSS- A DIVA SUPREME,AN ICON, A STATUE OF FASHION ALL IS REFLECTED IN THIS COLLECTION OF MOSTLY INSPIRATIONAL SONGS OF A BROKEN HEART ..HERS.THE SELECTION SEQUENCE TAKES YOU THROUGH THE PAIN AND AFTER, THE HEALING PROCESS.LIFT EVERY VOICE AND SING- EVERY DAY IS A NEW DAY. I JUST CAN'T STOP SINGING THAT SONG..EVERYDAY. THE TWO FASTER SONGS WILL HAVE YOU ON YOUR FEET DANCING ALL OVER YOUR LISTENING SPACE. ALL ARRANGEMENTS ARE TIGHT AND FILLING. THE LAST D.ROSS PRODUCT I PURCHASED WAS SWEPT AWAY 1984. KEEP THE MUSIC COMING! YOU'RE BACK."
5,"The best of the best, also...","Along with Relax, this CD is a pillar of my stress management practice. Whereas Relax is all music, Destress includes some nature sounds and foghorns. Both are the best of audio-brain technology, and are best listened to using Seinheiser 515 headphones."
2,"Seinfeld got better at stand-up later, I think.","Sorry to disagree with the other reviews, but I think Seinfeld got much better later, as a stand-upcomedian, especially if you compare this 1987 video with his later ""I'm Telling You This for the Last Time.""The material on this older stand-up routine was pretty thin, and the parts in between the stand-up are very unfunny, I think. Surprisingly weak humor. It's interesting to see how he was as a stand-up comedian back in the 1980s, though. He became much better later when he slowed down his delivery, and polished his stand-up humor.I'm still a big fan."
1,Junk,"This is a made in Tawain piece of junk, don't be fooled by the Porter Cable name. There is no way to keep this thing from leaking both air and oil. Porter Cable should be ashamed to put their name on this."
5,Never forget Mambo.,Pianist Ray and Salsero Cruz are well recorded here as they show you they still know how to Mambo. Salsa too! And a bit of their Sacremental Christian music but quite beautifull.
5,Wake-up Call,"Great, clearly written analysis and defense of our Constitution by a First Amendment attorney. The book is short, but there is no fluff."
5,An awe-inspiring disc!,"This CD was absolutely incredible! Corigliano's music bristles with energy and at the same time can still to a very beautiful calm. The piano concerto is exactly like this. It is one of the most phisically and emotionally exciting pieces of music that I have ever heard. The work is mostly atonal, but there are some very nice tonal sections in the piece. The third movement is proof of that. I do not usually go for atonal pieces, but the piano concerto is one of the best that I have ever heard. The last minute-and-a-half of the final movement is absolutely astounding; it's jaw-dropping! The other pieces on this CD were excellent too. I especially liked Tournaments. And Corigliano's orchestrations are some of the best I've ever heard! So, if your looking for some great, approachable modern music, I can't recommend this disc enough!"
2,where is this going?,This book is unfocused and none of the characters are very interesting. I couldn't finish it
1,Like Being Trapped with a Boor on an International Flight,"The 62 ""little tricks"" presented on this audio book may or may not work, but the cloying and overdramatized reading by Ms. Lowndes makes the material unlistenable. Listening to this audio book is like being trapped with a boor on an international flight.I regret having purchased this."
1,stay away,what good are her ideas if you can't listen. The author's delivery is so over overdramatic it demands to be shut off after 1 minute. Don't believe me? I'm trying to save you from intense pain.
4,Adult with autism,"This movie came highly recommended by an attendee at the Sundance Film Fest where it premiered. Autism is as varied as the person with it, and this story portrays a young man with classic social limitations. As a person actually married to a man with Aspergers, I can confirm the challenges of relationship poignantly described by Beth near the end of the film. The alternate ending is better than the one chosen for this DVD and in fact was the ending used at the film festival."
4,Very informative,This movie was very informative regarding an issue not spoken of often. The Aspergers Syndrome that holds Adam hostage does not stop him from learning what love is. This is not Oscar material but does explain the barriers these people often go through with relationships or the lack of.
3,"Not bad, for the the price","First, let me say that I am a huge fan of rose hip oil. But as rose hip oils go, this one is relatively mediocre, especially compared to the higher grade rose hip oils (e.g. kosmea). This is cheap, and works okay, but there are definitely better ones out there."
5,Does miracles on scars,"I have see this product work on scars of a girl friend, a decade ago. Worked great. Now I bought it for some scars on myself. Expect it to work well for myself too.You can find ten times more rosa mosqueta for the same price on the internet. But they don't come in a handy roll on applicator.And I would rather pay a little more and feel confident I got the best product. This Aubrey brand is sold in all major health food stores, which gives me more confidence. It lasts at least a month unless you have huge scars.It might work for stretch marks, which are kind of scars.You have to use it for several months."
2,ick,"Based on the great reviews on here, I got this and believe or not, my skin actually looked worse and worse each day so I stopped. It wasnt at all moisturizing for me, maybe my skin is too dry? so I had to put my face cream on over it. My skin got irritated by it too so now I won't be using it again. I have slightly sensitive combo skin. I am sad because it seems rose hip seed oil is supposed to have great benefits for the skin...none of the beauty products I get from health food stores ever work very well."
1,Does not seem to be Stainless,"I bought this exact item in Lowes for about $2 more than Amazon's price. After 6 weeks it developed 2 rust spots, one of which I scraped off with my fingernail, leaving a blotch revealing that this item has a lacquered finish that apparently protects it from rusting. The finish is easily scratched and when so, the metal under it rusts in that spot. Why would a ""stainless steel"" item need a lacquered finish? Save your money and only buy a truly stainless item or a glass/porcelain soap dispenser than this cheap (which should have been a tip off) made in China dispenser."
5,The Greatest Game Ever Played,"This game is awesome. You're in Australia and you're a tasmanian tiger named Ty.You have all of these different boomerangs that do different things. For example, one boomerang freezes, one sets things on fire, and ond zaps things. Another thing is there are five tasks to do at one time so if one is too hard, then you can try a different task. If you want a game that is awesome all of the way through, then this is the game for you."
4,Full Fun!!,"Ty 2 is a very special game. Very suitable for kids as it does not contain violence which is healthy during growing ages. I recommend the complete serie of Ty. Besides, it is all about aussie (Australian) adventure, an unknown world for many kids and parents.Franklin Zambrano"
1,Ty 2 - Big disappointment! Will not work on Wii systems!,Hello I'm an autistic adult gamer.This is my review on Ty2 for GameCube.Let me something first so this review makes a little more sense. I've been a gamer for 20 years & just recently got a Wii & found out it could play GameCube games well the GameCube was one of the few systems I did not buy or play until recently on my Wii. So I figured this would be a cute game to try out first on my Wii cute graphic's but only works intil start menu took the game back to GameStop explained what happened exchange the game for the same game same thing happened again with the same game I got my money back & GameStop told me there is some kind of GLITCH with this game apparently it only work's on GameCube systems & not Wii's.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR YOUR WII IT WILL NOT WORK ON THE WII SYSTEM THERE IS A GLITCH IN THE GAME!Thanks for taking the time to read my review!& Happy Gaming everyone!
3,buy columbia albums,"Though I listened to only a bit of two of the cds and then returned it because they were all scratched due to the notorious crappy packaging, I can say that I'm actually happy things worked out that way with the packaging. I'm much happier with Solo Monk, Monk's Dream, and Criss Cross than I was with what I heard of this set."
3,It is okay,It has some good tips but not enough instruction to go with. Trust me I still am struggling to keep my poor bonsai alive. Nice illustrations though!
4,Bonsai (101 Essential Tips),Verry informative for a biginer.Lots of info with pictures so you understand what they are talking about.
3,"Overview Only, Not ""All You'll Ever Need""","I'm utterly shocked by reviews that describe this book as ""the only bonsai book you'll ever need"". PLEASE. This is a little pocket manual, not a comprehensive review of bonsai. I'm not saying it's not good for what it is, but... KNOW WHAT IT IS! This thing is literally little... about the size of a half sheet of paper, and very thin! The book is, at best, an overview."
4,Nice book for beginners,"This is a great book for bonsai beginners or those just looking for new ideas. The pictures are beautiful, but that is most of what this book is. I am just venturing into the art of bonsai, and this book gave me lots of great ideas. But if you are in need of more details and how-tos, I'm sure there is a better book out there."
5,EASY TO UNDERSTAND,"AN EASY TO USE REFERENCE BOOK WITH 101 TIPS FOR BONSAI GROWERS - HELPFUL FOR THOSE WHO ALREADY HAVE A BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF BONSAI GROWING. ALSO READ THIS MORE COMPREHENSIVE BOOK:Bonsai School: The Complete Course in Care, Training & Maintenance"
3,Bonsai,Came quickly. The book is alot smaller than I thought it was. Print is small to read. But full of interseting things.
3,Rufus is a nutty kid,"I agree with the review below about ""Poses"" being too much like Rufus' debut album, i.e: a few brilliant performances (""California"", ""One Man Guy"", ""Grey Gardens"") peppered in between melodramatic snoozefests (""Evil Angel"", ""The Consort""). The end result begets a sort of pessimistic frustration: you suspect that the good bits are the result of blind luck, rather than artistic design. But I could be wrong -- let's hook this guy up with a clearheaded, less-is-more minded producer (Tom Waits? Ric Ocasek?) and see what happens...."
1,Disappointing,"The quality of this cd was far lower than I had hoped, based on his previous work. I've never heard a better album than his first one, but Poses lacked that special something that I loved so much about his other work."
4,Perfect starting book,If you are interested in starting on derivatives instrument this is one of the right books.
3,Not my cup of tea,"The mystery itself was fine, but Agatha really grated on my nerves. I understand she's self conscious sometimes, but she overcompensates by lashing out and being rude to people who didn't even provoke her. And what in the world does she see in James Lacey? (and vice versa, what does he see in her?) They are suspicious of each other, insult each other, yet it's supposed to be a love story. I didn't get it.I prefer M.C. Beaton's Hamish MacBeth series instead."
3,Tiresome,"Once again, Agatha Raisin has shown herself to be rude, crude and promiscuous. She has a lot to offer if she could just grow up. I enjoyed the previous books but when this one just repeated her insecurities and immaturity, I wondered when she would grow up. Hopefully, the next book will show some growth in her personality. But keep the feistiness."
3,Less James and more Agatha,"I do enjoy feisty Agatha and her self-doubts, but I am tired of James, though I do find Roy, who is transparent, amusing. I enjoy mystery stories, but I wonder how much longer I will read Agatha if I have to wade through her ""relationship"" with James. It's getting to be boring...bring on someone else for Agatha or kill off James or both."
3,Needs improvement,Whoever uses this software will be done with it on day one. If this CD was a book it would only have 12 pages!!Very very few exercises in here and after a couple of hours it is all over and makes you wonder why you wasted your money.
5,Lanza Greatest Hits,Mario Lanza was one of the greatest (if not the greatest) tenors who ever graced the state. A true Italian who grew up singing as a true tenor should.
4,Handy and informative,Small enough to tote along as you explore Florence. All text and diagrams of key monuments and venues. Adequate info on lodging and eateries. This was the primary guidebook we used on a recent trip to Florence - along with the indispensable Rough Guides map - supplemented by a few photocopied pages from other sources.
3,Not to be left outside permanently,Great net for our PVC build goal. However we leave the goal up all summer long and after a few weeks in the sun the elastic disintegrated and the netting lost all shape. I suggest buying a roll of velcro to attach the netting in addition to the straps included.
4,Rural Revolts and Their Leaders In Mexico,"In depth coverage of rural revolts and the grievances which led to them. Includes tables (in appendices) which show population distribution and numbers of haciendas versus ranchos in 1877 and 1910. Good information on the motivation of key personages such as Zapata, Villa, Carranza, Madero, Calles, and Obregon. Definitely for the person who is a student of the history of the Americas or peasant uprisings leading to revolution."
4,Unrepentant Almost,"In the midst of the current fundamentalism, this book makes an unintentional political statement in its advocacy of desire. The early parts of the book are wonderfully free of psychobabble and contain some good insights on sexual, romantic dynamics.However, towards the end of the book, Ms. Bentley psychologizes her torrid affair with ""Mr. A"" and that, of course means, passing judgement on it in the analytical verbiage to which we have become accustomed and nauseated. We dont know why Ms Bentely chooses to end the affair, but one can imagine that Mr. A decided to move on after Bentley endlessly trying to ""understand"" and correlate it to her childhood ""issues"". The former ballerina would have done much better reading her Nietzche than spending time on the couch.That criticism aside, it's an exciting read. 4 stars."
3,The Surrender : An Erotic Memoir,"I wanted to like the book more. It was a compelling quick read, taking almost explicit direction from Erica Jong's Fear of Flying, both in tone and journey - only updated for anal.A personal and detailed exploration of the author's ""salvation through anal sex"", the book is at its best when the author is describing her experiences and observations about anal sex. Those parts were insightful and well-written. Regarding how this fit into her life at large however, it became somewhat flimsy and rather self-indulgent.Don't write it off though; it was hilarious. Read this on a short flight or on vacation! It's better written than alot of airport novels, and just the right size."
4,Bentley truly steps outside the box...,"Has all the trappings of a true erotica classic--naughty sex, obsessive protagonist, trampled taboos, etc. Some critics have called the book ""self-indulgent,"" but how does one otherwise write about a subject such as this?Bentley's story does not have to be accepted, believed, copied, parodied, or rejected, but it truly should be considered."
5,It will put you in a good mood - very entertaining,"I just loved this new book by James Warhola. I bought it because I wanted to learn more about the artist, Andy, and whow was it entertaining. I got to get a glimpse into his family life. My kids absolutely loved the illustrations. They are in such detail that you just don't want to move onto the next page. My kid was very much entertained and wants me to keep reading it over and over.I would highly recommend this book to children and even adults.I follow this artist and have to say that besides his many other books, this one has to be his BEST. Enjoy!"
5,Heartwarming and inspirational,"As a professional artist, I can relate to those early childhood experiences that fostered and led me into my career in art. What a wonderful gift for a child. My niece loved it!!!"
1,Brain machanics!,"This is a wordy, diatribe on brain mechanics.The best that can be said is that Dr. Goldberg is considering establishing for profit cognitive enhancements centers along side retirement chains around the nation.In chapter 15, Goldberg gives ancedotes about the aging who benefit from attending his cognitive center. He does not describe the contents of the computer programs they use. (trade secrets?)This center offers, ""personal cognitive fitness trainers and a broad, all inclusive cognitive cocktail."" (whatever that may be?) All this and a 'bag of chips' are sure to be expensive.My pattern recognition system has seen this sleaz before. It used to show up on television in the wee hours of the morning. The 'informercial' has now hit the scientific community and book publishing."
2,assumes too much,Listening to this tape I get the distinct impression the vocalists enjoy listening to their own Itialian. It leaves very little time for a new speaker to absorb the auditory sounds and repeat. It assumes one has had Italian lessons before and knows more than the basics.This is a more advanced audio tape than beginners. Needs simplifying.
3,teach yourself italian complete couse package,excellent cd and book will come in handy when travelling
4,They Do It Again!!,"One of the many unknown and underappreciated bands that, if the music business worked as it should, would be all over the airwaves. They build on their last cd, the amazing Southern Rock Opera, by adding more instrumentation to the songs. In addition, the two songs by Jason Isbell are a welcome addition to the excellent writing by Patterson Hood and Mike Cooley. The band has been dropped into the ""southern rock"" bin and while they fit there, they are so much more than that. What really sits the DBT's apart are the lyrics. If you grew up in a small town in the south anytime in the past 25 years, my guess is that half these songs will have you saying ""I know that guy!!"" These songs are novels boiled down to five minutes and set to great music. Do yourself a favor - purchase this disc and, if you don't already have it (and why don't you?), get Southern Rock Opera."
1,A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this game before I looked at the reviews, and now I regret buying it. It is the 2nd worst game I have ever played(1st being Finding Nemo). If this game sound cool to you don't buy it before renting it. If you don't rent it first, I am telling you, it is a waste of money!! I payed $20 on this when I could've spent it on a better game, now I wasted 20 bucks on that piece of junk! I lost valuable weapons on that game because I died but could'nt save at any time I wanted to. That is why you should rent it first or waste your money."
2,Disappointing!,"I will start off by saying I am a HUGE LOTR fan,I love the books,and I love the movies...I don't like The Third Age.I'm not obsessed with video games,and I dont even know what RPG means,but if that's the type of combat...I don't like it.This game gets very annoying after a while.I cannot get past the Mines of Moria cause there's these stupid goblins that scream there heads off and always kill you!I really don't like the stupid magic everyone seems to have,even the goblins!And since when do orcs become so powerful!Anyways...It's kinda cool to play characters that were never part of the trilogy,but they're just spinoffs of Borimir,Arewen,Gimli,and Strider.The one cool part is the exploration.Its really cool to just wander around and see all the parts that we didnt see in the movie.But I still dont really like this game...but maybe it gets better if I'd try to finish it.Botom line,buy the Return of the King game instead,now thats an awesome Lotr game."
1,READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY IT!!,"First off I must say I don't really care for RPG games, but this one in particular was the worst I've ever seen. Even my friends who like RPG games hated this one. You play as less than reconizable characters from the book, which in fact has them in different places, not on a trip. Unlike The Two Towers, not an RPG, you run around without getting attacked, and when you are attacked the fight isn't determined by your swordsmanship, you have to attack in an orderly fashion, each person with there own turn, and the can't be hurt unless it's the other person's turn. You can't save unless you run long enough that you run into a ""saving station"". When you win a battle the heroes make stupid victory dances."
1,This SUCKED,"I finally rented this game after waiting about a month. I thought it would be like the Return of the King with the original characters and everything, but it wasn't. You would fight like the Pokemon games on Gameboy, and you wouldn't even start with the original characters like Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and all the other ones. I played it for two minutes then shut the game off. It was so stupid. I would never in my life recommend this game. Don't even rent it like I did. What a hunk of junk!"
4,structured breaktaown,"I bought this CD never having heard BogRac. The drum/drill & bass Bogdan creates is a bit more traditional than the likes of AFX or Squarepusher (who introduced me to Bogdan), but with all the cut up music-box melodies and Japanese voiceovers this CD is hardly ordinary. It's 26 tracks, and while none are very long, hardly any are filler. Most of it is what you'd call either wacked out jungle or orderly drill & bass. Kind of in the middle, I guess. The beat never stays in one place too long and it never gets so far out you lose it. A solid album throughout if you're a breakbeat, jungle, or drill & bass fan...."
3,Funny and Gory,"Jeff Strand definitely has a funny bone. This grisly story was filled with quirky humor throughout. It wasn't very scary, however, and I found the situations to be rather silly at times. Recommended if you want a quick, easy, and humorous read."
4,Chilling story...,"The story grabs you and you turn the pages. There are rough spots as one might expect in a first novel without strong editing, but--given the author's intimate involvement in the legal system--one is chilled at the depiction of the law enforcement process as described. I suspect that the truth is closer to the story than we should accept. A casual mention is made of the governor of Arkansas. That would be...?"
2,"Why a ""PS3"" carrying case?","I was forever looking for a carrying case for my new PS3 slim, and the reviews, (which I'm sure you've looked at), just don't sell you. One day, I was in Ross with my wife, and I strolled past the luggage section, and found a GREAT carrying case. It's one of those little ones with the handle and the wheels on it so you can pull it behind you, but still offers tons of support. I can fit plenty in there, (PS3, 4 controllers, a 32 disc holder, power and a/v cables PLUS my 15"" Macbook pro and accessories) with room to spare. So before you go looking for a ""designed for PS3 case"", try going to a retail outlet, like Ross, and seeing what you can get for $39.99.Hope this helps!"
4,A very good case,"I bought this case when I found out about the huge size of the PS3 and obviously its weight. It's so close to perfection, but it's missing something to protect the PS3 from being scratched with the belcros and also that the games slip when they're inside the case. Besides that, a really good product."
3,Playstation 3 Case,"The zippers open this case up a bit too much making it awkward when going through airport security. It is comfortable to cary and seems to protect the unit well, althought the top of my PS3 now has scratches on the top of it from being in the case."
4,Good if you carry your PS3 to other places,"Before the G-pak I carried my PS3 in the original box wrapped in a T-shirt, the G-pak is much more convenient. At first I felt a little uncomfortable trusting my PS3 to the velcro flaps and strap, but after a wile I realized it was fine. It protects the unit fairly well, but not as good as the original box. It's great that you can leave the unit in the carrier while using it and, all you have to do is disconnect and close it up when you are ready to go.Other good points. The flap in the back makes easy access to your connections. The pouch on the front holds two controllers and accessories just fine. The removable disk holder works great. Lots of air venting to keep the unit cool. Shoulder strap is reasonably comfortable.The downsides. You don't get a color choice (fine by me I liked all the colors). the strap that holds the unit in place rubbed the shiny finish dull. It can become heavy after carrying a while.Hope this info helps."
1,Not x10,This is not an X10 compatible product. It has no X10 coding capability. I don't know haw a normal rocker switch got an x10 rating.
5,one of the best end-of-the-millenium cd's to get,"combining hits from many albums from the late 80's into the early 90's, this cd captures the mood of the last decade and the songs to take us into this new one"
2,Millenium,"These totally 90s stars appear disguised as a millenium dance party. I really like G Thing and Baby Got Back, maybe Humpty Dance, overall just a shallow not satisfying compilation to retain your sense of humor. Whites are a minority."
2,Too academic for a real practitioner,"I purchased this book hoping it would provide me with further insight in the art and practice of conducting large group deliberations. Unfortunately I found the essays to be rather academic and too removed to be of much value for my purposes. While I am sure this book would serve well for those doing research in the area, the lack of detailed and plain language suggestions did not help guide or inform my work in group facilitation."
4,An excellent new folk record,"This is a fine record by a new songwriter. Dzik has a voice that reminds one a bit of Dylan and Chris Rea, and maybe a little like Johnny Cash. His songs cover a wide range of emotions and characters. This is one of the best folk and folk-rock CDs that I've run across in the past few years."
3,Missing teeth,Shootfighting veteran bart vale has a bloodwar with an unknown who refuses to quit in much talked about match. Gracie walks through the comp. of mostly amatuers.Not the present level of NHB but interesting.
3,More Work Than I Thought,"I figured the swab would make my life easier in the sense of not having to really work up a storm inside of my tub. Well, not exactly. It's shaped awkward (rounded weird), which makes it harder to work with. It's actually more useful for the bathtub tiles."
4,"Good, Informative and Comprehensive","This is a good price guide, seems to be realistic, covers a large array of issues, very comprehensive, I would recommend this to anyone. I used this over a decade ago and thought it undervalued things some, but with time comes wisdom I guess, seems to be as accurate as can be hoped."
4,Great game,this is a very fun game and a great first person shooteri enjoyed it very much and would be probebly be my 3rd fav or 2nd fav bond game right behind the original goldeneyethis game has great graphics also and is very realisticthe game is a bit long yet stil great i got my game for $[...]is it worth $[...] not really$[...] more likelyBUT $[...]!?!?!?!?!? AMAZON SELLS THE BEST GAMES REAL CHEAPBUY THIS NOW FOR $[...] ITS NOT A RIPOFF!!!!!!
2,SLOPPILY MADE,"Im sorry but are did we play the same game. This game was not what I expected. For all the hype about this game I expected it to be ""game of the year."" But the graphics are extremely poor. With the technology today the graphics SHOULD have benn much better. Also, there is ""auto aim"", for those of you who don't know what that is, it is a system where if you shoot NEAR a bad guy he will get the full efect of shooting him square in the chest. I hate that. Bottom line, this game COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER!"
2,Rent it... Don't Buy it.,"Honestly, I did not enjoy this game very much. As first person shooters go, frankly, it's on the lower end. I do not see how a Bond game could be so horribly bad. The only... ONLY good thing about the game are the graphics. The eye powers are nifty for maybe... two seconds? The multiplayer was the worst form I've seen in years for a Bond game. No bots? We have the technology. Beating your little brother a million times gets old. This game could definitely have been spiced up. It had potential, and it did not realize this potential. This game is only for the most diehard of fans."
4,Im no star wars nerd but...,"First i would like to say that i am no kind of star wars freak, and this is the only star wars game that i will willing play. Decent FPS style, simple controls, and decent replay value. A few minor problems thought, enemy heros are a nightmare to kill, and when you do kill them, they normally bring you down with them. You can't pick up enemy weps! This drives me crazy, every other FPS game that i have played has had this possibility, such as Socom FTB2, Coded arms, assorted James Bond games, (good games...good games...)and just about any other FPS game.Pros:Simple controlsGood replay valuefun being a herogood unit selectionCons:enemy heros will normally not die, or take you down with them when they doenemies will often swamp youYou cant pick up enemy weapons"
5,My son likes it,My son loves star wars. The game arrived in a timely manner. I have no complaints from him. He told me that he likes it.
4,Way overdue,"One of the best bands to come out of the 80's, Loverboy delivers on this live set. All the classics are here played live with an intensity that only the live setting can provide. There are a few tracks that make you scratch your head and wonder why they were included however- Track 6 seems out of place here, Track 8 is not one of the better tracks, only 2 out of 14 is a pretty good deal I'd say. I did miss 'Gangs in the street' which is strangely missing. A good disc nonetheless. Sound quality is definitely 80's- big sound and loud with a lot of women in the audience(naturally hence the band title)screaming in unison. Packaging is also very good with a tribute to late(missing?)bassist Scott Smith. Now the next step is a live dvd, the 80's Toronto show would be my pick. Are you listening Columbia? Definitely a must-have for any Loverboy fan."
1,Useless,"Assembled easilly enough and looked OK, but it didn't work.I don't mean it didn't move enouh air or didn'r occilate. I mean, it just flat out didn't work at all.It just sat there and hummed. I was afraid it might blow the circuit.Return was easy though. and my credit card was refunded promptly."
2,Very cheap product!t,Adequate to do the job but the base is very cheap and flimsy Probably would not recommend it to friend.
5,Love This Fan!,"I now own two of these fans. The first I got to use in our in-home gym. I loved it so much I got a second one to use in our bedroom. It's easy to assemble, is very attractive, and is whisper quiet."
4,Fine Fan....But.......,"I got this fan for a fair price, and the shipping was very fast. When your hot enough, any fan seems like a gift from above. The only thing I would mention is the lowest speed available is not very low. It blows a good deal of air even on its lowest setting. If your looking for a fan that delivers a gentle breeze, look elsewear. Otherwise enjoy the gale force winds....."
1,Don't waste your money - does not work!,This volcano does not erupt and was a huge disappointment for my son who spent his allowance on it and his time painting it. We would bring it back but we have painted it and attempted to use it several time with different formulas of vinegar and baking soda.
3,Don't screw angry...,"This book focuses on the one thing I DON'T like about Susan Johnson's books... Angry sex. I've been reading her books for years and there is usually one scene that focuses on two people who are angry enough to do violence deciding to jump each other instead. In this book, that's about all you get. The background story line was so weak it was forgetable and there was no intimacy between the two mains. This book was a mindless cover-to-cover fight and screw with an ending so forgetable I had to go back an hour later because I couldn't remember if I finished it or not."
2,BORING ! !,"The only interesting thing about this book is its setting in a comic book store owned by the heroine. Otherwise, the whole book was really lots of ho-hum. Not bad, but not good, either. Sex scenes uninspired, no real emotional connection between the leads, either. A major disappointment."
1,Vent extender,The plastic on this is very flimsy and it is a waste of money. I think it would be dangerous to use as intended.
4,A very entertaining historical adventure.,"While based on actual events this novel has an epic ""Lord of the Rings"" type feel to it.Atilla the Hun is a powerful unmerciful force of nature and the protagonists are imaginative and skillful in their battles with him and his forces.A stong cast of characters and real adventure and heroism make this a highly enjoyable read."
3,"Same theme, different characters.","If you read Hadrian's Wall, then you read this book with different characters. I have read all Dietrich's books and lately he writes about a main character who is in love with an unattainable person and as a result, gets into all kinds of trouble before it comes out all right in the end.Here, a young Roman diplomat joins an embassy to Attila the Hun and ends up as his captive. Naturally there are all kinds of fights and the boy comes of age as a result. The time period is interesting, as are some of the figures in the book, but the story is too much about the trials a tribulations of Jonas, the young insignificant Roman, than of the events occuring around him."
4,A pleasant discovery......,I just happened to stumble upon this movie while strolling through Blockbuster. I loved the message of unconditional love and forgiveness which was conveyed throughout the movie. And I do feel that the songs were very much appropriate and even moving. This is one of those few movies that I can watch more than once and still feel as though I've learned something new about life and love each time.~ Lex ~
5,Ginger Chews,"Wonderful,chewy, refreshing taste! Great to settle an upset tummy without using medications. Just as advertised. Ultra fast shipping. I will order again. Thank you!"
5,Excellent,"The phone really surprised me. it works like a real phone!quick installation, easy to use. I'm very happy with it"
2,Poorly Designed,Don't waste your money this thing is not well made. The battery attachment went wonky after only a couple of tries. CDs make a lound scratchy sound while playing. The battery life isn't very good.
3,some useful info.,This machine plays movies on dvd-r.This machine does not play mp3 on dvd-r.It has two headphone jacks.Mine has a disfunctional volume control.Overall this is O.K. product.
5,Gratitude for this remarkable book,"SEXUAL ABUSE BY HEALTH PROFESSIONALS is an amazing combination of the personal and the professional. Not only does Dr. Penfold have the courage to come forward and describe her abuse in great detail under her own name, she also provides a professional framework for this type of abuse, including an explanation of the problem, the process, and the effects of professional sexual exploitation. This helps the unexploited reader understand the scope of the problem and the complex manner in which it occurs. In addition, it helps those victimized by health professionals understand that (1) it can happen to absolutely anyone; (2) victims are not to blame; and (3) recovery is possible. I read SEXUAL ABUSE BY HEALTH PROFESSIONALS during my recovery from therapist sexual abuse and, more than anything, it helped me stop blaming myself. Thank you, Sue."
4,Definetely a great title.,"Definetely a great title. EA could have done better in a few areas, but it is an overall solid title. The gameplay is good, but a little bit of improvement really would have helped. Solid, but not 100%."
1,BEWARE,"This product does not work with the new 4th generation iPod nano (though it says it does). I ordered it with my nano b/c Amazon suggested it as a common companion purchase. Well, I thought it didn't work b/c it was defective, but when I contacted Eforcity they told me it doesn't work with the 4G nano. They have been great about replacing it free of charge, but do NOT order this with a new nano."
4,Rapid travel charger for iPod,"The CTA Digital IP-TBC Rapid Travel Charger for iPod does the job and for the price it's great. My only concern is that it's not well made but what do you expect. It is very convenient and easy to use. Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone that needs one when they travel."
5,More Than Expected,"Excellent charger. Actually, charges iPod faster than advertised. Excellent product and well worth the cost. (at least from where I purchased the item) So far, I have charged my iPod several times with no problem. One day, three of us charged our iPods right after each other with no problems. I recommend the charger. AND it costs ALOT less than the chargers in the stores."
5,Ipod Travel Charger,"Now it's easy to remember to recharge my Nano. I keep the charger plugged into the outlet by my purse, its red light reminds me to plug in. It's that easy. Plus, I'll be able to recharge my Nano while traveling. That's really why I bought it."
4,This product is worth your money!,"A friend of mine found this on Amazon, so I decided to try it out. Sent my docking station back and this thing rocks the house. I was amazed by how well this thing works. It came manufacture packaged and was just like the description. Don't waste your money$$$ any where else. BTW Apple's iPod products are all compatible. They have the same insert."
1,Disappointment,This charger worked for about a week before it quit on us. I was disappointed by the quality and (lack of) longevity. Don't waste your money.
1,Did not work for my ipod touch 3.,"Thank goodness for easy Amazon returns. This is going right back. The description maes it sound like it will work with any ipod or iphone, but it did not work for my ipod touch 3."
5,Works as intended (Great Price),"Bought for my son to take to Europe while attending a school trip. The charger worked as intended, which is all I and my son were hoping for. Pricing was competitive and shipping was fast. Ordered on Amazon as local Best Buy store did not have anythig like this... and if they did, I am sure it would cost more!!!"
1,Waste of money,It broke the day I got it. The plug got stuck in the wall and nearly ruined the outlet. The worst thing is that I can't get my money back because it would cost more to pay the return shipping than the product cost itself. The cheap price you pay isn't worth it.
1,"This is just WRONG, Folks.....","Okay....I have finally come to accept the BRATZ: a bunch of teen hoochie dolls with false eyelashes that look like they've been hit by a MAX FACTOR truck and obviously shop at the FREDERICK'S OF HOLLYWOOD warehouse factory....I even can roll my eyes and walk past their trampy looking pets (BRATZ CATZ) but now here it is: The BRATZ BABYZ: Infants in diapers wearing false eyeslashes, make-up and chains. They might sell leather diapers too...I didnt stick around to find out.What Baby Brothel are these tykes working at???"
5,No way,"Well, perhaps if you had enough manners then you would get what you want. You sound like Kinsey. I was being perfectly polite so don't you insult me. Perhaps I get sick of talking about Cloe all the time. So shut up. And I hope that this review was helpful to you and that I don't brag on about Yasmin all the time."
5,"Thank you, Lord","At last I have the digitally remastered CD of this true jazz masterpiece. When I first heard it on vinyl back in 1981, I was blown away, although I was by then a devout Carmen fan. I loved it then, and I love it even more now.This is the album for anyone who has not heard this great lady. Sorry Ella and Sarah, but I believe Carmen McRae was the greatest female jazz vocalist ever.On this disc, she is in superb voice -- full, husky and always expressive. Like Sinatra, Carmen McRae made any song her own. No better example than Billy Joel's ""New York State of Mind."" And what an extraordinary group of musicians, playing breathtaking arrangements. My only criticism is the use of strings. I just don't think they belong in jazz.Carmen lives!!!"
2,Not very well known songs,"I will first say that i am partly at fault for this unsuccessful purchase. I bought this book blindly because wasn't able to see the table of contents to view the song list. Nor did Amazon.com list the songs available in this book. I figured that with ""120 best known Christmas songs"", how could any of the common popular songs be left out. Well, if you're looking for Frosty the Snowman, Silver Bells, The Little Drummer Boy, Here Comes Santa Claus, Jingle Bell Rock, Sleigh Ride, The Christmas Song (chestnuts roasting..), and some other REALLY well-known songs, DON'T LOOK HERE CUZ THEY AINT HERE. But songs like, ""The Boar's head Carol"", ""The Friendly Beasts"", ""Pat-a-Pan"", ""Wassail Wassail"", and ""Bring a torch Jeannette, Isabella"" are all here if you want them. I would not list these songs and more VERY obscure songs as ""best known"" at all. So be warned."
1,Not for Kindle,You can not view these songs on Kindle. The font size is to small and can not be increased. I purchased this and returned it. I was very disappointed that I could not find a book with only lyrics for the christmas songs. let alone one that I could actually read the lyrics
1,Disappointment,"I have this grinder for just over a year but it was only used a couple of times. It worked OK but a long way from commercial grade. Small bone that accidentally stuck in chunk of meat managed to destroy the gear as it would be a cheap plastic. And what a surprise. I took this thing apart and found a plastic gear inside, which is engaged with metal drive shaft of the motor. Combination that should never work. Just wondering about this guy who designed it. Long story short. Almost $100 for the new motor and $65 to install. I will never use it again. Look for something with a completely metal gear. Hope it helps to make a decision."
4,"Good, but....","The earphones are very good by themselves, but the noise supression feature is no match for my treadmill. Even so, I am satisfied with the purchase and the price."
4,Lightweight and easy to use headphones at the right price,"I travel a lot and these headphones are perfect for turning an economy trip into something a bit more comfortable. They are easy to pack in your backpack or purse, since they come in a small carrying case and are lightweight. As for comfort, you can wear them for hours without getting sore ears. And the sound quality is good. Probably not great (like high end noise cancellations earphones), but good enough to get me through trans-pacific and trans-atlantic flights in comfort."
3,Worth the price..if you travel,"I purchased the Sony MDR-NC40 Noise Canceling Headphones and open the box to try them out. First thing I noticed that they only sound good when you power them on. Not sure why anyone would design head phones to sound crappy when just wanting to use them as headphones when not using them in the noise canceling mode. I drive a semi-truck so I tried them with the noise canceling on and they seem to do the job. They do not cancel all noise but really tone them way down. Makes listening to music very nice. I just charge two rechargeable batteries and keep them in the pouch that it folds nicely into. All in All...If you travel, these are great and worth the purchase (because I have not sent them back yet). Do not buy these if your looking for everyday headphones because they sound terrible just as headphones when not turned on."
4,Great for the money,"I've used it only a couple of times, during long flights. The sound deadening is great on the higher frequencies, less so on the low frequencies, but the low frequencies kind of hum you to sleep anyway. I think the sound quality is great, but I'm not as fussy as some. Finally, the ear pads could be a little more comfortable, but I dare you to find something more comfortable at anywhere near the price."
3,o.k. for the money,The noise cancellation was minimal although to be fair I haven't tried any others so I might be expecting too much. Engine noise was still fairly evident on my last flight. Sound was satisfactory though. They were great when used in quieter surroundings. I am safisfied with the product for what I paid for it but I intend to try a pair of the upper end headphones such as the Bose on my next flight.
2,Uncomfortable,"I like Sony products, but this one wasn't up to expectations. It is very good in terms of noise canceling, but it is not comfortable and it usually cause me headaches."
3,Sony noise cancellation headphone,"I bought this noise cancellation headphone to listen to classic music in fairly noisy environments. I am sort of disappointed that the headphone does not cancel out high pitch noises quite well. However, the headphone cancels out reasonably well low pitch noises so that those of us in noisy environments such as airplane cabins love to use it."
2,"Good headphones, noise canceling not so much","While I agree with previous reviews that these are comfortable headphones, I have had problems with the noise cancellation aspect of them. I bought them with the intention of blocking out the hum (both man-made like conversations in a library or mechanical like airplane) and they are only satisfactory. Often they will actually cut out the noise of whatever podcast I am listening to, which seems to defeat the purpose. Overall I wish I had spent a little bit more and gotten a pair of headphones that would do the job better."
2,blocks noise with tons of bass,"My husband wanted another set of noise canceling headphones because we take his so often. (He owns the Sony MDR-NC6, but I didn't know the model # when I ordered. My big mistake.)Without being turned on, the headphones sound cheap. Once turned on, it's all bass. I felt like I do when one of those cars pulls up beside you at a light with their car buzzing from the bass. It almost made me queasy. It was that bad.I understand that this set might be great on airplanes, so maybe this is just not what we need at home. But our other set doesn't have such a huge difference in being off or on. That set sounds great off, then when turned on, it just blocks out the noise around us."
5,It was great! It is now sold by Granite Books,"in Salt Lake City, Utah. I hope they will publish all of Dorothy Kennington's out of print books!"
4,free money to pay your bills,"This book gives all the answers on how and who to contact to file grants , low interest loans and the like to help get you out of debt. It actually gives more information than most people would need. So far it has helped me by suppling adresses that I could not find anywhere else."
2,Not so interesting book.,"The book starts out fairly interesting, but then lapses into constant descriptions of noises and things that go bump in the night. The part about the old woman who abused dogs was creepy, but if you are looking to be scared out of your wits, this is not the book for you. There just was not a lot of meat here, and by the end of the book, you do not really feel as if you have gotten to know the family in question really well. I recommend Elaine Mercado's ""Grave's End"" for those who like to be creeped out. I really do not believe in the supernatural, but I do like these books for strict entertainment."
2,Poorly written,"This book is very porly written. The only saving grace is it's just 125 pages long. Not at all scary, seems fictional. Don't waste your time on this one."
4,"Good for previewing, not a scholarly resource","My kids are using this version in a teen social group. We get together once a month to read Shakespeare for fun -- no analysis, no quizzing, just reading with other kids they like. It's perfect for that. If you really want the background information on the text, on particular word usage, etc., you'll need something else that's aimed at scholarly use, such as the Folgers editions, but if you aren't sure what is happening or what your character is tring to say and want to be able to skim an (OK, but not wonderful) modern language ""translation"" on the fly while looking at the original text, it's great."
3,Buyer beware,"One should be aware that this disc does not contain the original album (Cloud Nine). Runaway Child here is the radio edit, the four minute version as opposed to the nine minute version that appeared on the original album. The editing of songs seems to be a common practice in these Temptation two-fer's. So if you want the entire album as originally issued they should be shyed away from."
3,Use wisely!,"The R.S. means Landscaping and Site Work, 2002 cost data guide can help and hurt. It is full of wonderful data and prices that are a general standard in the industry. It is not a guide though, for the beginner. I made the mistake of using the guide for estimating purposes. If used in this manner, you end up with an over-inflated bid. I now understand that this is just a reference guide and not an estimating tool. Overall it is packed with a wealth of information, but on the downside it takes some time to understand, and use properly."
4,Site & Landscape Costs,This cost data is very useful for estimating the cost of demolition and remediation of plants and facilities sites. I believe it is the best information available at a reasonable price.
1,Do not use this product!!!!!,This was horrible it made my heart race and I did not sleep well at all!
1,Did not work for me,I read all the reviews good and bad and decided to give these a try. I should have saved my money. These did nothing at all for me at all. I tried up to two pills and no difference in my sleep. I must admit I do have sleep apnea and insomnia. But I expected at least something from these but got nothing except a loss of my money. Sorry but that is the way it is.
1,Focus on 3 women in early man's hisory,"Slow moving and shallow. The three ""heroines"" are all named Zena, not Xena, Warrioir Princess. Seems, from the writer's point of view, that sex and the woman is all-powerful. Controls man and his actions. Very weak story. Kept waiting for the BIG insight. Yes, I'm a man. Yes, I love nature. Yes, I love and respect women. No, I did not enjoy this book. Never felt magical to me or really spiritual. Early man and women were much more complex and thought provoking than are found in Circles of Stone. Characters were never fully developed. My advice, skip the book and hopefully there will be no movie. I finished it only because I had a cold and had to do something."
2,Opteka Wide Angle & Telephoto HD Lens Set,"I recently purchased the Opteka .5x Wide Angle & 2x Telephoto HD Lens Set for Samsung HMX10C MX10P DC173U DC575 for around $30.00. It seemed like a good deal but as everything that is too cheap, it turned out that the the telephoto lens did hardly nothing in comparison with the camcorder's original lens. meaning, I just used the camera lens instead of the telephoto because it did not get me any closer to the subject. Needless to say the tripod and cleaning kit are useless, just something else they include in the set to call more attention."
2,Flimsy connectors and grainy MPEG compression,"I find this unit not very reliable for recording - the flimsy 1/8"" connectors for A/V on the back cause video to come and go and I have to jiggle it to get a picture for recording - them sometime in the middle of recording it'll move just enough and leave me with a blank video screen with audio. OR I'll get the video channels but one of the audio channels will be off - just the left channel is recorded.Additionally on the highest level of Quality (TV mode) the video compression is still poor and very blocky - I was expecting much higher quality at this setting then I get.If you're considering buying this I recommend considering instead a A/V capture card for your computer - which should not have the flimsy connectors to it to cause you grief."
4,"You Get 'Em, June","Who'd'a thunk it -- after all those years of singing in Johnny's register, June Carter Cash has a delightful voice and stage presence. This CD was quite a pleasant surprise. I bought it because of Johnny Cash's presence on ""Far Side Banks of Jordan."" But, I've played it over and over again for all the other songs. And, the between-song banter, though sometimes gimmicky, is quite effective. You really do get the sense you've sat down to swap songs with June for a spell. And, her take on ""Meeting in the Air"" is, well, to die for...."
2,Lame and disappointing,"My collection includes most of Johnny Cash's output and several Carter family albums so I am familiar with this legendary family's sound. And on that basis I was so disappointed with ""Press On"" that I sold it. Her composed songs were amateurish in the worst sense. The gospel selections were a weak disappointment. The famous names on this albumn promised a great deal more than they delivered. On past recordings all of these beloved American icons have soared. The most they manage here is a feeble crawl."
2,Slow and Cliched,the pace of the movie dragged and seemed full of bad dialogue and cliches. It tried for too much drama.
5,FOR GREATER GLORY,"This neglected history should be in the forefront of facts to be learned. I was a student in Grand Seminaire de Montreal in the forties. Two professors were forbidden entrance to Mexico. Their religious pilgrimage to Guardalupe was a ""no -no"" in religious dress. ""Greater Glory"" made their experience eminently clear. A fine film."
5,Moving and inspiring!,"considering the current condition in this country, regarding the government's stand on removing the autonomy religion has enjoyed throughout our history, this movie is relevant still today."
5,For Greater Glory,This was an emotional charged movie. It did answer a question that I had regarding the reason for the separation of church and state in Mexico. Mexico is a highly religious country and I couldn't remember why the separation. Gracias.
5,A great movie,"I bought this movie for a Christmas gift for my wife and she absolutely loved it! I watched it with her and even though I had never heard of it before, I enjoyed it as much as my wife did."
2,rating would be higher if album was more consistent,"I saw eX-Girl in concert and they put on a goofy, techno, spacey stage show. After that show, I bought this CD at the shwag table.Unfortunately, when I got it home and popped it in tht player, it didn't quite hit the mark. There are some very stellar moments but they are few and far between. Also, if their live show was any indication, it seems that they've drifted more towards a harder, edgier, punkier, alien spacewoman synth sound than is present on this albumn.My rating is heavy handed with 2 stars, but would have had 3 stars if the quality was consistently good, or 4 even if it was consistently good as the best tracks."
1,really not worth your money,"I knew this was going to be an online document when I bought it but didn't realize how skimpy it was going to be on information. I don't think anyone had reviewed this when I bought it... what a shame. I think the only reason you might want to buy this is if you are a Wes Anderson FREAK who needs everything to do with him OR if you are writing a paper on him and you need some kind of more official sounding source to cite than a Wes Anderson fan site. Instead, you should buy Roald Dahl's Fantastic Mr. Fox, so you can see what Wes is working on next!"
3,"Pure Bass, not to be confused with Japanese orig. BGM","This is not quite what I had expected. When I heard that Toonami was going to release a soundtrack called 'Deep Space Bass' through the record label Rhino, I made this a CD on my 'must get' list because of the previous good work Rhino accomplished on the 'Best of Anime' soundtrack, and thinking I was going to get some of the same, original electronic BGM's to the kickin' Anime series on Toonami. Well, I can't say it's exactly close, but the CD is the BGM remixed heavily with rave and dance beats. It irked me a bit because I would rather have the original BGM sans rave beats and booty bass, but I know they are very popular in affluent urban dance circuits in a music genre called 'rave' or 'dance'. Anyways, If you are a purist and wanted a good way to supplement your Anime music collection, this is not the place to look, but if you like rave and dance mixes with bass, Toonami's Deep Space Bass is not a bad addition to your collection."
5,Toonami Beats are the SH*TS,"This cd is probably the best cd toonami will ever make. There is one flaw though. when i got the cd there were some titles different from the mp3's that u find from their website, but thats about it. but their beats r from thier original show so this somthin u must have if u love the show and their music. it has almost all of their intro music of the shows but they lack old school music from the past. But like i said if u luve anyting and everything about toonami u gotta get this cd cuz they have some beats that just can't be topped and if they were there wouldnt be a word to describe them"
2,If you collect gingerbread house books ....,"... then purchase this book to add to your collection. If you are a beginning ""gingerbreader"", this book probably won't be a big help to you. There are no pictures/photos provided as visual aid to explain procedures. I have several books on gingerbread house baking/creating purchased through Amazon. This particular book is my least favorite and the last I'd recommend."
3,Gingerbread Houses,I'm looking forward to using the recipe and the pattern included in this book. Making gingerbread houses is a great way to prepare for the holidays!!
3,Disappointing,"I agree with the Amazon reviewers who've expressed the opinion that Reiner's 1959 DON QUIXOTE is good without being quite the best (my own favorite: the early-electric recording [Victor M-720] by Eugene Ormandy & the Philadelphia Orchestra with cellist Emanuel Feuermann).Although the 1954 DON JUAN was favorably reviewed at the time of its original LP issue, RCA's CD transcription is unimpressive. Its downright muddy sound doesn't flatter Reiner's fast tempos. The whole business has an unpleasantly frenetic & congested quality."
3,Strauss Presented... And Not Much Else,"This is a very good reading of both works. The music is played nearly to perfection, and it is all done in a masterful fashion. However, that's about it. One sits down, listens to this recording, hears the music, but that's it. It feels totally devoid of any emotion, and lacks the glittery and sometimes flashy Straussian sound. To me, Strauss is about a sort of fireworks and indulgence of the orchestra, yet at the same time giving deep meaning through the music. This recording almost seems too serious, as if it goes for the meaning but in the wrong way, and is more focused on playing everything right than trying to say anything. It gets 5 stars for orchestral playing, but 0 for interpretation - which is a matter of personal preference only. I'll give it 3 just since it's mostly a matter of me, but if you like your Richard Strauss more alive and akin to the recordings Strauss himself made, go for others."
1,Never-ending Delay,"A great example of you get what you pay for. I ordered a driver for my husband for christmas, first delay message was received right before christmas saying it would not come until late january/early feb....ok, not thrilled, but not the end of the world. Just got another email....delayed until late March early April....what a crock...if you can't get an item don't advertise it for sale and lead customers on. Total BS."
3,A bit disappointing,"I was a little disappointed in this book. It seemed like nothing really exciting happened...the romance seemed a little dull, as did the plot: Gwyneth sees Gavin, a thief, get beat up by his fellow thieves and left for dead, so she takes him back to her castle to teach her village how to fight and protect themselves against an evil neighbor who wants Gwyneth's land and her hand in marriage, which he thinks will be easy to gain since Gwyneth's father is sick. Gwyneth and Gavin fall in love, but Gavin thinks she won't want a thief, so he stays away from her, while in the meantime the village fights against the evil neighbor's forces. A knight comes and stops the fight, and says Gavin can be his squire, so someday he can marry Gwyneth. Gwyneth's father gets better, everyone lives happily ever, the end. I was disappointed with such an unoriginal plot."
5,Translate more Miyabe,I liked this book very much and lent it to many others. I agree with the other reviewers here that it transcends the mystery category. Recently saw one of Miyabe's ghost stories performed at New York's Japan Society -- that also was excellent. Have been looking for other work by the author but it appears nothing else has been published in English. It would be great if Random House (or another publisher) would pick up her backlist and translate it.
1,Not worth reading,"This book was completely disappointing. I am amazed that it received so many 5 star reviews and that it won prestigious awards in Japan; that is just mind boggling. As pointed out by the other 1 and 2 star reviews, this book is long winded, rather dull, has a repeating chapter format and then just abruptly ends without any resolution AT ALL. I felt like reading this book was a complete waste of time and would recommend that, if you are considering reading this book, reconsider and maybe select another book. This author received so much credit, from this book it is hard to imagine the other books being any better. I might try another book from this author in the future but I must admit I am very hesitant to do so."
4,Pretty decent story,"Not a bad western for the late 40's. Mature made this around the same time as ""My Darling"", which, obvioulsy is much better than this. Still Mature does well with westerns. The brother/brother conflict plays up well, but, kinda ends with a thud. That could have been tied up better. Considering the ""age"" of the movie, the quality was very nice. Ibought it and don't regret it, as I will watch it again. Some may prefer to just rent it."
3,Mature,"Average, fairly low budget western. Trite story line. Saved by a young and dynamic Victor Mature. Easy to see why he went on to bigger things. Good for the western movie buff."
2,Not so good!,"Of course I bought it for the price. It freezes. Had to uninstall, reinstall. Works only with disk in the pc. I also bought Brainiversity at the same time, works much better, more fun and just as challenging."
5,Well-designed!,"The creators of this product really put a lot of thought into it. It is easy to install, thanks in part to their drilling template, and the AEBS mounts quickly and securely. The mount for the power supply was a nice touch, too."
4,Great book for practice of situations,"This is a great book to practice different situations with your friends or read on your own. It shows you different SOAP charting, nurses notes, doc orders, pt H&P. All the same info as you would find in a chart, you can learn how to read it, how you can write it yourself. Situations are general (most common) diseases you learn about in the beginning of classes. This is the exact same book one of my instructors used for us."
5,Absolutely Amazing,"This is one of the best albums I have ever heard. There is only one song I am not in love with. Great production and amazing musicians. One catchy upbeat song after another. Amazing percussion. Great songwriting, singing and lyrics from one of the world's most talented musicians. Long live Majek Fashek the Rainmaker. Everyone should hear this at least once."
5,Best Kill Bill Poster,"I think this is the best ""Kil Bill"" poster because it features a picture from each of the most important characters from both Volume 1 and 2 and its not the size of regular poster. Which makes it fun, and a great collecter iteam for fans."
4,Quality 80's rock,"Having once again heard the song 'Call to the Heart' on an internet radio station, I had to get this CD. Have the remnants of the cassette which was played so much it was worn out. One of the greatest bands from the 80's, too bad they didnt continue to put out music as a group. This is some of the best 80's rock ever. Really pumps you up and puts you in a great mood, like most of the 80's bands. FYI-- I picked up a copy of Silk and Steel on CD at a Target store, out of the blue one day. Never would have thought I would find it there. I prefer this disc. Would consider selling the copy of Silk and Steel."
4,Thin and powerful,"These towels are the most absorbent towels I have met, but they are not the soft, plush towels that belonged in a five star hotel. They are thin, quick drying and rather ruff. Towel warmers are lost on them since the heat dissipates quickly. The towel does not slide across wet skin pulling water with it so a new technique of patting must be learned, which can be tricky when drying one's back. However, once the drying technique is learned you may never go back to traditional cotton towels since these towels dry the body qui"
5,"Concise, simple and helpful","This is a very good book for coping with anxiety. It delivers what the subtitle promises: 10 simple ways to relieve anxiety,fear and worry. The author acknowledges throughout, that simple is not necesarily easy. Though the ten tips are simple, they do take concerted committment and effort to put into practice. I like this book so much that I recommended it as The Book of the Month in one of my recent newsletters to my subscribers. Kate"
1,Reaction to product,"The product is as advertised but unfortunately the material causes me to experience a reaction. Itching and uncomfortable is what I have experienced. Based on my personal experience, I must rate this product low even though others may have no problems."
1,Kill me now!,"If you decide to buy this CD, wait patiently by the mail box till it arrives. Upon arrival, quickly open the box, then pull the security tape from the jewel case. Open the jewel case and place the CD in one hand. Break the CD in half, then slit your wrists with the remaining shards. As you begin to die look at your reflection in the mirror-like surfice of the broken CD, and ask yourself what you were thinking when you ordered this CD!"
3,A review by a REAL mom,"I found myself wondering if any of the previous reviewers even have children. Okay, so it not the best CD in the world. It took some getting use to on my part. My husband refuses to listen to it. The singing kind of stinks but the kids LOVE it. And isn't really about the kids? I would prefer to listen to this than Barney or ABC Elmo. The Radio Disney Jams series is a better choice but my kids really like Kidz Bop. Some of the lyrics are not the best but I'm raising kids who live in the real world. Have you heard the kind of things they discuss in public Kindergarten playgrounds? This CD is not great but it'll make your kids happy."
1,"Okay, now I was gentle at first","I am breaking out in hives!!! There is a chorus of children singing ""You Don't Know My Name"" with their babysitter!!! Now, I recommended the last CD for a party and for your young child's collection but dadgummit, I can't do that again. It is only for your child to listen to in their earphones!!!!! This is a lyrical pimp slap at its highest caliber."
1,How?? and WHY????,"Okay, when i saw the commercial for this cd i got SOOO mad!! i mean why did they do this??? they took some of my favorite songs and made kids sing them! I HATE IT!!! i mean the 1st kids bop was okay bbut then they just kept on making more and more and more . . . . its just plain old stupid!! and those songs dont even sound like the originals. i would rate this cd a negative one hundred if i could but the lowest you can go is 1 star so i guess that'll have to do! i hope none of you parents even think of getting it for your kids!! or you'll get to go through the misery of hearing little devilish kids singing those pop songs."
5,erm...excuse me....,"Just thought I might write a review on this amazing cd. I can't believe that people are slating this work of genius.I think its plain obvious that Britney Spears, Avril Lavigne and Evanescence etc totally ripped their songs off from this album. When KIdz Bop wrote 'My Immortal' back in 1999 I heard a rumour about a spy in the studio (later confirmed as Amy Lee). This cd proves it! Pure GeniusThe songs are beautifully sang, note perfect. I even cried during 'The Reason'.So, dont listen to these so-called music lovers kids. they would't know good music if it slapped them in the face.next thing these guys will be saying is that iron maiden wrote 'Number Of The Beast'. I know, I have the proof, that 'Kidz Bop' didThankyou"
1,DUN DUN DUNNNNN.....,this cd is evan scarier than all the scary horror movies combined. ahhhh just thinking about it makes me freaked out. AHHHHHHH i have to go b4 this thing scares me to death. l8ter. P.S. this cd sucks.
1,Not very good,"I had bought a Kidz Bop CD, but I got very sick of the songs. Although the cds held some of my favorites, I thought too much kids sang along with them. They over did it with the kids voice, and made it sound like a 5 year old's CD with a teens music choice. Sick."
5,Son Sparkled. Mom Sparkled Too!,"We love these cards! By we, I mean our entire family. I purchased these for my 18 month old. We already had the video and was delighted with it, and I thought these would be a great extension to further explore other languages. My son absolutely beamed over the pictures, espicially the peas, the dog, and the firetruck. I love that I'm learning with him, and it is easy because the pronunciations are spelled out in a way that is easy to understand. He knows over half of the cards in Spanish by now. Additionally, and unforseen, my eighteen year old and her boyfriend like to hold the cards up and try to pronounce the words in all of the languages: Spanish, French, Russian, German, Hebrew, Japanese. They laugh as they are learning. It is great interaction for all of us!"
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed in these cards. I feel that they are a plug for other Baby Einstein products.
1,"Don't buy these!!! Buy ""My First Touch & Feel Picture Cards: First Words"" by DK publishing instead!!!","As many other reviewers mention, the images on these cards are terrible! For example, the image of what is supposed to be a bear--- is actually a plastic bear figurine playing a violin!!! Is that what we want to teach our young children??? A bear is natural, big, living creature....and I have never seen one play a violin! The same goes for the image of the duck, frog, fish, etc... they are all images of ugly plastic toys! These cards are poorly done."
1,Only if you use in conjunction with the videos,"I bought this cards thinking that they had true photographs of the actual objects. Instead, the animals are the stuffed creations from the videos and not photos of real animals at all. I thought this was very disappointing, especially since I loved the concept of the different languages on the cards. I think this set is only useful when used with the videos."
2,Warped,"The concept for these cards is great, but I do not recommend you buy them. The pictures of the animals are not of animals at all, but of stuffed toys that barely even resemble the animals ""depicted."" Children would be confused by, for example, a frog that barely even resembles a real frog. I pulled all of the ""warped"" cards and have used the remaining ones with my daughter."
5,A good range finder,"Having purchased a cheaper ranger finder and being very disappointed in its function, I was very pleased that the Bushnell lived up to its advertised hype. The range finder does what it claimed to be able to do. Red Ceder trees were easy to get a reading on, even past the 600 yards for non reflective targets. The ""Slope""( Angle Range Comensation) is a nice function, especially when setting up a range or field of fire. I could of lived with out ""Slope"", but having experienced its function I am very please I put out the extra bucks for the added function."
5,A living legend,"Leontyne Price (still alive) and already passing into immortality amongst vocal artists, both classical and popular. Leontyne Price stands at the pinnacle of her classical art, but those who only know her work in La Forza del destino or the Verdi Requiem are in for a heart rending treat with this album where Leontyne Price goes home to her roots in Mississippi and gives an unabashed account of the classic spirituals she sang as a young woman. Like John Mc Cormacks rendering of Irish songs there is a personal longing and devotion expressed here that reveals a side of the artist not known in the bulk of their ""classical"" repetoire. A sense of going home like Citizen Kane's rosebud, or as Dorothy Gale observes at the end of the Wizard of Oz ""everything I could ever have wanted was right in my own backyard """
3,"Ah, Florida.","Interesting insight on the world of modern newspapers. The sniper angle has been done, and better, before. King writes well, you won't be bored, but hope for better the next time."
3,Too little bracket for the money,"Although the bracket is sturdy, it's much smaller than I expected. I'm giving it 3 stars because the price was too high for the device."
1,An excuse for sin,"Mr. Warnke is a proven liar and a false prophet. To claim that he is a victim of Christian ""witch"" hunting is to ignore the ... sins he has committed in the name of Christ. Truly he is the victimizer! If only Mr. Warnke would repent of his sins and come clean, like David of the Bible. I wonder if Mr. Warnke has disqualified himself from the race and rest not as one cloaked in the grace of God, but stands as an apostate. Truly the saddess part of the story are the thousands who have believe his lies in the name of Christ."
2,Dissapointed,"Compared to the other prima guides especially comparing the World of Warcraft guides, I was expecting more from this guide. More class details and information about trade skills. The maps that are given in the book are almost useless since the game itself shows you most of the info already by adjusting you are looking for with the in game map.The game itself is great though. Guide isnt worth the money."
3,Disappointed,"I was so disappointed in this book. The first book I read by this author Bewitching was wonderful. This book had a lot of promise but did not deliver. There was not enough of a backstory for Richard and his troubles and I found Letty very annoying. I gave this three stars because even though I was not crazy about the story the author's writing style is very good. I have not given up on this author, I am on to my third book, ""Wild"" and I hope to find it as entertaing as ""Bewitching""."
3,"Quick, diverting read","Why do female protagonists always have to be clumsy? I'm not usually one to be annoyed by the literary equivalent of slapstick, but I've seen a lot of ""oh she's so clumsy, it's endearing"" lately and it's kind of annoying. Give me a less-than-beautiful-with-perfect-curves romance heroine who has grace and poise. I guess that's not why we read romance novels, though. Letty's clumsiness does factor into the plot quite a bit, so it's somewhat understandable in that respect.Dreaming was humorous, and a quick read. The Kindle version had a LOT of typos and missing punctuation in the later chapters. The introduction of other characters--Neil Seymour, Alec and Joyous, Mary MacLean, whom I assume appear in another book--was really abrupt. But for a $2 Kindle book, all around, this was enjoyable."
5,Great Book,Letty fell in love with Richard the day she ran over him while riding on a cow and he was riding on a horse. Everyone knew it too. From that moment every meeting is painful - for Richard. The beginning of the book is no exception. I like the way that Letty is still a klutz throughout the book. I loved this book and really enjoyed Richard and Letty. I love their interaction throughout the book. I loved both Letty and Richard. And I loved this book that was sometimes so hilarious. If you plan on reading a Jill Barnett story this is the one to read. It's the best one of all the one's I've read.
5,absolutely funny and wonderful!,"when I first saw this book, i did not even think about reading it because a story about a girl running after a man is not something i usually like to read about, but something drew me to this book. Even right after the prolouge, I was laughing so hard, I had to tell my brother about it. This book is filled with outrageous humor and sections so happy or sad that I found myself crying. This book will make you laugh, cry, fill joyous, fill angry, and will make you want to scream out with frustration or triumph. I highly reccomend this book. I am even having my mom read it! I loved it and hope that you love it too."
4,Superb Acting,"SOME CAME RUNNING is a fairly entertaining movie about a returning soldier and his attempt to adjust to life in his hometown after World War II. Sinatra is an inactive writer who falls in love with a local professor of creative writing (Martha Hyer). He meets her through the introduction of his phony older brother (Arthur Kennedy). Sinatra's friend ( Dean Martin) is a gambler and a tragic figure who manages to keep up a cheerful front. Shirley MacLain is a floozie who loves Sinatra without any reservations.The acting in this film was superb. It received Oscar nominations in 1958 for Best Actress (Shirley MacLaine), Actor (Arthur Kennedy) and Supporting Actress (Martha Hyer). Vincente Minnelli received an Academy Award in that same year for his direction of GIGI."
5,Fantastic!,"My daughter and I love this book. She's almost ten and reads at a high level, but the lessons behind the stories and the questions brought up are long and thoughtful conversations. I would recommend this book for any age - I enjoy the stories as much as she does - sometimes more!!!!"
2,This book is about flameworking.,Title is a bit confusing. Great for those interested in flameworking. Not what I expected.
2,Christmas Angels Disappointing,"The music was executed well, but the arrangements were terrible. I wish it was not Christmas music. The arranger chose to change it with very irritating harmonic combinations. If one likes music with strange modern disonances, this is your CD. If one is looking for Christmas music that reminds one of Christmas, look to another CD.I was very, very disappointed."
2,Old Dwight Gone ?,I was disappointed in this long awaited CD. No sign of early Dwight. A mixed up mess of songs that I didn't have a clue what he was trying to say. Dwight obviously wrote these for himself and not the rest of us. He's lost touch with what sounds good. Hopefully he can someday regain the magic of his early work.
5,Rich and luminous,"Don't let the Jungle Drums title mislead you. This is mainly a collection of lush, lyrical music. It was recorded to two-track tape in 1955 in RCA's prime location of Webster Hall, and the sound generally is excellent. Half the album is given over to Ernesto Lecuona's music, and very engrossing it is. The arrangement of Malaguena put me in mind of Percy Faith's arrangement of the same song--both are full bodied and excellent. The two classical standards on the album by Falla and Villa-Lobos are beautifully done. I can't say enough about the orchestral playing. I once read an interview with a player who said that Morton Gould was the only conductor he played for who didn't have any charisma, but you would never know it from this recording. This album is definitely a keeper."
2,The Urbz,"I tried to get into this game but just couldn't, the camera views were really confusing, and there weren't a whole lot of Sims elements to make it feel like a Sims game."
1,These are only songs there isn't any lyrics to sign along to.,"I decide to write a review as this is a piss poor product. I am looking for CD that I could play in my player that I along with friends could sign along to, not just music."
5,The American Dream turned nightmare,"""Hate Is My Neighbor"" is a harrowing true story about ordinary Idahoans banding together to fight the Aryan Nations, a neo-Nazi sect which had established a toehold in the Couer d'Alene area. Authors Tom Alibrandi and Bill Wassmuth take you to the town meetings and the clandestine ones in graphic, at times stomach-turning detail. While the book is stunning in its revelations about the virulent hatred which can lie beneath the surface of an innocuous-seeming merchant or housewife, it shows that a brave citizenry can and did conquer it. For the present, at least. The book is written in an unusual style which takes you into the protagonists' minds (Bill Wassmuth being one of them), and this contributes to its spellbinding appeal. I could not stop reading, even at 2 am."
3,Nothin' Special,"The knife and fork on the end are a lot bigger and heavier than I imagined and it really throws off the balance of the chopsticks. Good as a gag gift, probably."
1,Disappointed,"Ordered thinking decent price fun little handy gadget, boy was I ever wrong. Battery was dead, installed extra battery worked a few minutes then died again. What a total waste! Nice concept, terrible product!"
3,Castable depth finder,"Easy to cast, but performance is very dependent on the orientation of the receiver to the transmitter. It's really a 2 man job to use it. Also, it doesn't work well in rough water. It has been very useful in informing me about the condition of the drought affected ponds I normally fish."
2,Eats Batteries!,"Well I've used this thing. As a depth finder it works well. As a fish finder I found it useless. It confuses weeds with fish, and as a test I used the finder as a bobber (you can do that!) with a worm hanging about six feet below it. A fish was yanking on the line, but the finder never saw a thing!The batteries are expensive and it will burn through one in a day of fishing.I'm going to give the Norcross Hawkeye FF3355P a try, see if it works any better."
2,worked for a couple hours,brought this along for a vacation up north. I used it in part of the lake where I knew the depth and it certainly has a little error. However that was understandable. What was not understandable was it's non intuitive buttons and the fact that stopped working after one outing. The screen just went black and the item just stopped working. Changing the batteries didn't help. I requested a refund rather than an exchange.
3,Wow her first WW novel and I glad it was only one,"I have read every WW novel since '96 and this one is right up there with the Masuerade of the Red Death trilogy, boring. Come on it is Gehenna I want to know what is going on not follow a rather static plotline around visiting big babbies in the world of darkness. *sigh* and if you actually liked that trilogy then you will probably enjoy this, but if you expecting somthing exciting like I was you will be sorely disappointed."
3,Has become smaller in size,"This was my medium sized dog's favorite toy and I just bought him a replacement as the stuffing is coming out. However, the new one is at least a third smaller than his old one, which will make it harder for him to hold it and make it moo."
3,Cute,"This is not as big as I thought it would be and after her playing with it for a while it was broke, so she nevers plays with it anymore. You could just hear the voice box inside crunch when she was playing with it, and she is just 20 pounds, don't think it would be good for a large dog."
5,My puppy lkoves it.,"I bought the moo cow and our puppy loves this one too, along with the frog we bought her. She just loves them both and will be buying more for her to enjoy."
3,Don't play tug with it.,"I think it's good for a small dog, but a bad decision for larger dogs because it is one of the easier plush toys to destroy. My 10 pound shih-tzu is not able to make the sound go off by herself unless she accidentally steps on it which I don't like because I'd prefer her to be able to bite it and it go off. I was playing tug with her and one of the legs slightly tore right off the bat. Now I just click the internal button that makes the 3 moo sounds and let wrestle with it. It's not bad, but I think there are better options for the money."
4,COOL,this album is cool and i was attracted to her voice when i first heard her do the rappin in USHER album. her voice n the way she rap makes u wanna rap like hell so check her out.....
5,Love and Houses.,"Marti Leimbach's third novel is fantastic. From the first line, you are there. You care about her. You laugh at and with her. You love her for all the reasons you would probably want to strangle her. She is a protagonist you can root for. She is every women. She is smart, funny and not immune to her own follies. The novel is so much fun. It is playful and hysterical and overwhelmingly sweet. She is masterful with dialogue. The story seems trite at first: Hubby ditches knocked up wife, but Leimbach uses this seemingly cliched set up to weave a novel filled with wonderful characterizations, witty observations and outrageous situations. I loved this book so much. I was drawn by the cover, but had no idea what a treasure awaited me."
4,Great!!!,"This book was great. My favotrite part was the illustrations of the ships the Wahoo had sunk.It was a little bit dry but, if Clear the Bridge! is anything like it i'll buy it!"
3,Decent price - Shotty packaging,Works fine. The price was good. Many of the attachments don't fit together. I bought if specifically for the wall mounting option. It is more quiet then the Eureka that I used to own.
4,Nice shop vac,"I have had this vacuum for about 6 months now and I'm generally happy with performance. I used it vacuum out my crawl space and it worked really well. I did have a few hose clogging problems as items bigger than a quarter will start to jam up. I recommend keeping an eye on it if you notice the suction stopping. I also noticed that it's good to clean it often as the dirtier the filter gets, the less suction.I also use it for vacuuming out the cars which works really well.I would agree with the other reviewers that the attachments are odd and need to connect in series. I'm not sure why every adapter does not just plug in without having some ""middle"" attachment needed. Overall, not an issue, but weird engineering."
3,GOAT,"Breaking rules, but thot I'd write about the great review by Lizz Mendez Berry. Excellent writing, no wasted words. Selection of content in Lizz's review said it all -- provides insightful observances on L.L.Cool's music overall. As a relative newcomer to hip hop, and selective with my $ ...I truly appreciate a good review. Hope Lizz writes more. P.S. I don't know her...this is not a plug by a friend, just a satisfied reader."
2,G.O.A.T?,"This album is ok, but I don't think it's worthy of the title G.O.A.T (greatest.of.all.time). Songs like ""Imagine That""(track 2), ""LL Cool J"" (track 4), ""Take it off"", ""Homicide"" (track 13) are all good. But the best is "" "" with Kelly Price (track 12). However he is a good rapper. This album is equal to phenomenon in my mind. ...."
2,GUESTS HELP ALOT IF NOT THIS ALBUM WOULD BE SUNK,"Man, I have to say, this CD contains nothing but rips, same ol' recycled material, and alot of guests. If his guests hadn't of helped out, this album would be sunk.METHOD MAN...YEAH! LL is not a bad actor, but this CD is far from being the best.... G.O.A.T? I don't think so.."
3,Not bad,"This one was a mixed bag. I liked it alright (and I might be the only one that actually liked MISS I) but I have to agree LL has done a lot better. ""Imagine That"", ""Fugetta Bout It"" and a couple of others are the best tracks though. I would advise getting this with his next release 10 (which was the better of the two)."
5,A movie full of fantastic acting performances,"We enjoyed the movie's drama, suspense and comedy although we found the script a bit complicated. The highlight of the movie was undoubtedly the acting, from the performances of Carmen Salinas, Espinosa, to Ernesto Barquet, all of whom lived up to their reputations. But perhaps the best surprise of the production was the performance of the talented actor Horacio Castelo, who demonstrated an incredible ability to assume the personality of his character and display emotion, anger, and adventure with a most natural demeanor. With his performance Mr Castelo should look forward to a long and rewarding career as one of Mexico's most exciting new actors. Finally I found the cinematography very compelling and the camera work was original. A very good movie indeed, recommended for those interested of Mexico's complex cultural and social-economic realities."
3,Minimalist to the point of dullness,"The Bottom Line:After seeing and loving A Man Escaped I got really excited about Bresson but two films later (Pickpocket and this one) I'm not convinced that the first film I saw by him was an aberration and he's a really boring director; Mouchette is a widely praised film but I gotta tell you, it's quite a slog to sit through even at 80 minutes and it never does anything to suck the viewer in to the story.2.5/4"
3,Must digest the information.......,This book has the potential to bring more fish in. Through my experience fishing it did help me understand some of the techniques he wrote about. Must process the information and adjust it to your region.
3,Cheap plastic and plywood,for 114 dollars I expected something with a little more than cheap plastic and plywood .The layers of plywood for edges and the glazed over chips show the fine craftsmanship. made in China. Enough said.
3,False advertising,"This was advertised as Lee's push on filter for 100mm lens. What was delivered was the Lee foundation filter holder. Since I needed this too, I didn't return it. Caveat emptor."
1,Ignore the 5 star reviewers. They do not read history!,"As has already been mentioned --- the author makes numerous assumptions, but offers no proof, because he apparently feels that facts and figures are not required in a holocaust book.Mr. Dean should not set himself above truthful and honest approach to a touchy subject."
4,Great Outline For A Strategy,"Great way to outline a strategy and answer questions that you need to know during the job hunt phase. I believe some of the strategy is does not apply to my particular industry (Outdoor Sporting Goods), but still a worth wile read."
2,Just the Basics,"I wasn't overly impressed with this book. It did give many of the basic information you would need to job hunt, but I was looking for something a little more than that. The best part of the book is the web sites that are provided."
1,Joyless film,"What a disappointment this film was after reading a stellar review of 4 stars on [..] The review compared Balthazar the donkey as a type of Christ, a suffering servant who doesn't complain and then finally dies. The photography was good, but the story was joyless. The characters had no seeming purpose other than the moment and many sinful, selfish moments there were. Relationships were surface and there was nothing uplifting or transforming regarding the film's characters. Instead, the film is depressing...devoid of hope and true faith. Even the movie critic included had a loss of words to bring meaning and merit to this movie. The only thing lovely and angelic is the DVD cover. I'm a film buff and would not recommend this film."
2,The only one I didn't like,"I am sorry to say I didn't really like the book. It was not that frightening and very predictable. It is unlike Mr. Straub to be that way. I was disappointed in this one. It is worth reading style wise, but if you have read others by him, you might be let down."
3,Just an Average Ghost Story,To me this book was just average. I've read better and I've read worse. The main problem was that I didn't like any of the characters. Julia herself was weak and unbalanced. Magnus and Lily were manipulating and deceitful. All either of them wanted was Julia's money. Magnus symbolizes the worst sort of man. The part I disliked most in the entire novel was the scene of reverse pedophilism. I was disgusted by that. What was Straub thinking! And the ending? It left me dissatisfied and wondering what just happened.
4,Correor Yui,"This is a great book! It reminds me a lot of Cardcaptor Sakura. If you liked that, then you would love this too! Yui was one of the only people who did not know how to use a computer, funny how she was the one chosen to become a corrector. Her job is to try and protect the Com-net from the evil virus Grosser. Very beatutiful artwork too! I mighly reccomend this book for lovers of shojo manga!"
4,The River Cottage Cookbook,"Good, honest easy cooking with a twist. Frank and funny with regard to making the most of the bounty of the countryside from nettle soup to bunny burgers. Perfect reference for making jams ans preserves to growing your own produce."
2,Very Dissapointing,"This book is advertised as a cook book, which would lead you to believe that it is full of recipes. This is far from the truth, although it does have some recipes it is also full of information that is not only used as mere page fillers but information that is not needed in a cook book. All in all a very disappointing purchase, i expected a cook book not compendium on farming. I would not recommend this purchase to anyone else."
3,"5 stars for effort, but 2 stars for readability","I must say that the author did an excellent job if he intended this book to be a record of the day to day action on all theaters of engagement between the French and the Viet Minh.Because of the excessive level of detail, the book is very diffcult to read and appreciate. It is a mind numbing experience.Read this only if you wish to know in detail the horrible sufferings that that combatants on either side faced in a senseless war. Otherwise you will be better off with just a summary."
4,Prepare to lose your mind,"In my opinion, The Young Ones especially are absolutely essential viewing. Especially for Americans, as they tend to labour under the impression that the English are all prim and proper. Can you decide if the gentleman is a driving instructor from Johannesburg, or really a vampire? Little Britain does nothing to preserve what is left of your sanity, with material that is often off-colour and off-the-wall.Those comfortable around ""alternative"" British humour will like it. Those who have never encountered it before should realize that the jokes are as much in the context and the timing as they are in the situation or the words. These are NOT sitcoms.As much as I like both the series, I'm only giving this four stars because they simply don't go together. There are much better pairings. I wouldn't suggest waiting for anyone to fix that, though."
1,Stay away!,"Worked fine for about 36 hours then video card died. It was just long enough for me to move all of my data over from my old computer and reinstall most of my software. I don't have time for POS computers like this. I guess I should have read the reviews before purchasing! To be fair to Amazon, this computer was purchased elsewhere."
3,Pure Practicality,"""Teaching English Pronunciation"" is a book entirely focused on the language classroom and the ""how to"" of doing pronunciation instruction. While there is some theoretical stuff there, it is very much in the backgroud to the practical side.The book goes over issues such as sounds and spelling, introducing word stress and sounds, and so on. What I really liked was a section given to different languages and the problems their speakers have with pronouncing English sounds. Languages here include Arabic, Spanish, French, Chinese, Japanese, German, Italian and more. This is a very useful section to have access to.Is this book worth $78 (at time of writing)? I am not sure. It is a small book for that price. However, it is a good book, as well. I would prefer others, myself, but this one was not too bad at all."
4,A must have!,"For those of us who don't work at a bench all day, this is a must have. I don't know how I got along without it. It would be 5 stars, but 40 bucks is a bit much for a strap and a magnet."
5,Works great,"We have used the Combo CD for the past five years for my oldest son and two daughters. They all enjoyed the music and the soothing heartbeat always lulled them to sleep. Now that our family has grown to four children, my oldest shares a room with his little brother. He likes this CD better because they use hymns as the music over the heartbeat instead of children's songs (used in volumes 1 and 2). So, my youngest and oldest can enjoy relaxing music and fall asleep fast, without my preteen having to be subjected to listening to ""baby songs"" every night."
2,Bad Pad,I bought this pad for Christmas and after two weeks of use the pad doesn't work anymore. The sensors are all messed up. Not a good purchase.
1,DDR Batting 750,"We've had the wireless set of 2 which both were faulty and returned for new set; we've also had the wireless set be less that useful -- always messing with the settings, positioning, etc. to get them to work.So we ordered this wired set which is more expensive, seemed to have good reviews and 50% of what we ordered (1 of 2) was bad out of the box, and on Christmas -- what a big bummer for the kids for what seems poor production controls on quality. Having 75% failure rate on their products is pretty bad.Of course this is on the pads -- made in China -- so I wonder. I've also had serious problems with Sony products and customer services in general -- maybe it's just the PS2 genre and Sony spectre."
2,Not as strong as it says.,"I bought these to hang a 16"" x 48"" piece of 1/8"" mirror plexi to a metal wall. I put twelve of these squares on the back. I do not know how much the mirror weighs, but it cannot be more than two or three pounds at the very most. Twelve of these keep the mirror in contact with the metal, but it slides down the wall until it touches the floor. I am now shopping for different magnets. This says that they hold 1/2 pound. Take that information with care. Not BAD magnets, but not as strong as the information here seems to imply."
4,Impressed. Period.,"It's not often that one finds a documentary movie based on a true story and stays interested, wondering, and maybe even admiring until the very last-minute. These were my feelings after watching the movie.Whereas I don't want to spoil it for those who didn't watch it, I must mention that the director, screenwriters, and actors did a fantastic job with keeping the tempo of the movie fast paced and exciting."
2,Gr=eek wins,"Interesting tale of how a jealous, hateful, geek nerd screws his only friend, and others, out of the Facebook business. Eisenberg is the quintesssential geek, nerd anyway. Just see ""The Squid and the Whale."" Same actor and essentially the same part. The geek, nerd just had to show up for filming and say a few lines."
3,Social Network - Big hit or sucker punch?,"The Social Network, in my opinion, successfully delivered the story of Mark Zuckerberg and his climb to fame and fortune. However, I thought the movie failed in it's effort to tell us who Mark Zuckerberg is. For that matter, I didn't feel that I invested too much emotion into any of the characters in the movie. I felt as though I were watching a documentary that didn't focus on people, but the acts of people. Because of this, I didn't really care who's idea Facebook was. I didn't care who got the credit or the money. In addition, the dialog in this movie was extremely fast, making it difficult to follow at times. I certainly didn't hate the movie. Remember, I said that it ""successfully"" delivered the story. But in the end I realized that I just didn't really care."
5,this should be a bluray+DVD combo,when i got the disc and saw its a 2 disc bluray i thought both disc is loaded with extras but actually 1st disc is just the movie with 2 commentaries while disc 2 is the 2 hour extras. this can easily be fit into 1 disc.i think Sony should follow Universal by having bluray/DVD/digital copy format
2,"smart, but ultimately overwrought","starts off with a lot of aggresive and crisp dialog, edgy logic and emotionally involved. problem is movie eventually falls into the stereotype of the socially awkward nerd and the ultimate betrayals don't feel right emotionally and end up depicting zuckerburg as much too naive. i think the screenplay took too many liberties with the history and ends up feeling false and contrived, with the elaborate dialog undermined ultimately by a hollow emotional feel that doesn't add up."
4,A little too much for the older viewer,this is an excellent film but it is probably a little too much for the older viewer.Not saying that it is not true but only saying that sometimes reality is more than the beholder can bear and this film tests the limits at times
3,Ok not great,I thought that this movie was ok but I didn't love it thus the 3 stars. Lead character is a jerk with basically one friend who he eventually loses because of the way he was jerk to him. The twin Harvard brothers were equally jerks only in a totally differnet way. I truly hope that the people that these characters are based on are not truly the way they are portrayed. Not sure that the movie deseves all the hype but I usually don't like movies that are hyped up and get all the awards. The actors did a great job though of portraying these characters. They were all pretty much unlikeable.Sorry to see what money did to a friendship. A billion dollars is alot of money but true friendship is priceless.
1,THE SOCIAL NETWORK,"One of the very WORST films in years!...music and background noise took over the dialog...the soundtrack was just terrible...how this film won awards and acclaim is beyond me. Mark, the leading character in this film talked so fast his speech sounded like a foreign language...There were so many flashbacks it made it difficult to follow at times...a long boring film that we could not wait for it to end...so glad it cost me only a $1.00 to rent at REDBOX. I gave it one star because of the photography of Harvard and Cambridge...other than that it would have gotten a -0. In fact the movie gave my girlfriend a headache. As for FACEBOOK...pick up the phone and TALK to those you care about...turn of the computer! There is more to life than Facebook/Myspace/Texting...social skills are being lost. SAD!"
2,Interesting Movie,"I gave it 2 stars because it was interesting. The movie is based on the founder of Facebook. It spends ample time showing bar scenes and etc. Its not terrible, but its not a movie you would want to watch with the kids because the characters use all the cuss words, including the F-bomb. I would say it was worse than what I had anticipated."
1,Very bad movie,"When I saw the huge propaganda for this movie, and when I saw its 4-star rating on TV, I thought I am going to watch a classic. When I did watch the movie I was shocked. It started with a 15-minute boring dialogue between two bad actors and the boredom kept increasing with every scene. I gave it one star because there is no zero stars to rate a movie. I can say with confident that this is the worst movie I have ever seen. Bad story, very bad actors, very weak scenario. I regretted that I wasted my time watching such a stupid movie."
2,"Shallow, Preppy, and Boring. Just like Facebook.","I could have thrown ""overrated"" into the title as well. This movie was exactly what I would expect out of a film about Facebook."
2,"Good acting, but not much of a story","I am one of the few who thinks this movie is way overrated. On the positive side, the direction by Fincher and the script by Sorkin do move along considering the movie is not really about anything but the creation of a website. I did not like the movie but I was never bored by it. Eisenberg and Timberlake were especially good. My problem? Every character was a greedy, Harvard snob. I realize that you don't have to ""root"" for characters, but Zuckerberg is so repellent, it was difficult to get involved. He treated others so poorly that it was really disappointing to see him become successful in the end (although obviously I knew that going in). I really hated his character, and outside of being a computer genius, he did not have any redeeming or admirable qualities. Again, good acting, but it was an exercise in bad people behaving badly."
4,Nothing Groundbreaking,"Finally got to see this and found it entertaining, but not much more than that. This film garnered a lot of undeserved hype which seems to be just as much of an indictment on the shallowness of our culture as the film was.There's nothing groundbreaking about this film. Flash in the pan entertainment at best."
3,What's all the fuss?,"So a socially inept guy; screwed his friends for ambition. This is worth awards? It gets three stars because of camera, set design, editing and music. The story was passion-less along with the acting."
3,How do you review a disc that's not out yet?,"I realize people want to be first but since nobody can actually comment on the quality of the blu-ray or dvd version of this product (picture quality, extras, packaging, etc) and are instead offering movie reviews, you're only be helpful to someone who's never heard of Rottentomatoes.com."
4,NOT A MOVIE REVIEW - The Social Network,"I saw the movie in theaters and thought it was spectacular. Amazing script, great acting, wonderful music. I don't care if it's a false telling of the creation of facebook. But I'm not here to review the movie (even though it's a MUST SEE). I'm here to review this package. I HATE when companies do not include a DVD or Digital Copy with these blu ray releases. Sure there's going to be some 3 disc special edition (which I haven't seen yet...), but no digital copies and DRM up the butt is a contributing factor to why piracy is still going strong. I don't even watch the dvd version of any blu ray I buy, I just rip the movie so I can actually put it on any device I have. Legal and morally correct. That's how I watch my movies, but I will magically obtain a version of this movie that can be put on my smart phone, no (or maybe all) thanks to Columbia Pictures."
3,"Great product, but it is 3 WW PointsPlus points per bag (not 1)","Amazon needs to upload a new picture of the box. What you'll get is a box showing clearly that this is THREE WW PointsPlus points (not ONE). It is likely that the 1 point references the earlier WW point tracking system. 3 points is not outrageous for a decent popcorn like this, but if you were hoping for a 1-point wonder snack, this isn't it. It actually tastes pretty good, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it ""butter flavor"" as it could stand to use a bit more flavor, especially considering it is 3 points, not 1. But I have to say it is better than a lot of the lower calorie micro-popcorn out there, it satisfies the ""popcorn"" / ""crunchy"" itch just fine. And, you don't get in trouble like you do with the full bags... so just be clear on what you're getting here. I would order it again, I just won't be eating them as often as I originally expected given the higher points values."
3,"Good value for the money, but not what I was looking for","This was a 2nd choice for me. I wanted the 100 calorie kettle corn which I had purchased previously, but you no longer offered it. This is ok for a 2nd choice, but I would much prefer the kettle corn."
1,I hate this Album!!!,"This album sucks! I hate how Terry sings ""Skip To My Lou"" The way she sings it makes me cringe. I've heard it and therefore, it stinks! Nobody should buy this album, it's a piece of _______!"
1,How Old Is This Man?,Frank Allen has got to be one of the worst authors I've ever read. Does he honestly think he could make his living producing garbage like this? The stories are old and tired and some are [derivatives] from other books. I guess we could all have a published book if we plagarized like Frank Allen does. As I was reading this I couldn't wait to get to the end. I literally felt like poking my eyeballs out. The photo on the back cover is as bad as the stories. He looks like he just escaped from the psycho ward. Don't waste your money. Reading the back of the cereal box is more interesting than this book.
5,Fun and Interesting,"I thought that this book was both fun and entertaining. I enjoyed the stories and think that anyone who likes a good horror yarn will get a kick out of Bedtime Stories Your Mother Never Told You. I enjoyed the twists and turns in the plot as well as the characters in the stories. I think that this is the first book in a career that will be filled with many more publications. Who knows, he may be the next King or horror and you could be one of the in crowd that read him before he was famous."
3,"One of the great works of literature, awful translation","Njal's saga ranks with the all time great works of world literature, but you will not see why reading this translation. If you can dig up the earlier Penguin translation by Magnus Magnusson, read that version, which though published in 1960 is written in a much tighter and contemporary style and is more accurate to boot. Get it out of the library. Or hunt down a used copy. It captures the saga wit and just makes better sense of the complex action."
5,Weirdly timely view of the cycle of violence,"Although the way it's told will put off contemporary readers (there's little or no characterization or internal thought processes of characters), Njal's Saga tells a story that seems relevant to our own time, about the cycle of violence & the difficulty of restoring peace when you have once resorted to violence. A fascinating view of a society with too few structures to control violence -- like the international scene today."
5,outstanding psychological thriller,"I just loved this book. The ending was such a surprise (and I love surprising endings) that I had to read it two or three times to make sure I understood what just happened. Then I read it again because I enjoyed it so much. It could happen- well, maybe not exactly like that. And it makes your relationship with your mother in law seem tame by comparison..."
5,Fabulous,"I sat all day reading this book and didn't put it down until I was finished. If you like books such as ""The Notebook,"" this one is for you too. This is the way to get lost in a book and this is one that will stay with you for a long time. LOVED IT!!"
1,Unappealing,The story is mediocre and the illustrations are somber and static. This book was a great disappointment to my child.
5,SST-900I,My SST-900I didn't come with a power adapter - go figure. Bought this one and it's working great. Also purchased a Rainbird WR2-RC A55300 wireless rain sensor which requires the same voltage. This power adapter powers both the wireless rain sensor and the controller timer just fine.
4,Repeat of younger version,"We purchased the toddler version of Dinner Games about 3 years ago, and the boys had outgrown lots of the cards, so I gave our version to a friend and purchased what I thought was the next level. When we received the new version we opened it and started to look through the cards. I was disappointed to find that they're essentially a repeat of the toddler version. So far (after about 3 weeks of playing) I we've only gotten a single unique card (that wasn't part of the other version). Without the other deck it's hard to say how many are repeats, but it seems like a lot to me. Disappointing to spend money on a product we already had - HOWEVER: The dinner games in general are a great way to interact as a family over dinner. Some require a small amount of preparation, but most are just a great way to start discussions and play games."
3,Not what I thought...,I bought this beacuse we have a six year old that doesnt like to eat her dinner so we figured this might help because she loves games.. I was under the influence it had more games that incorperated the meal you were eating. It was not that. Most of the cards are just conversation starters or games that involve thinking. It didnt really do the trick. Its nice for conversation but didnt help our situation really at all. It did make me think of games that maybe I can come up with though to maybe involve the actual dinner.
3,No what you think,"Because the public is so mislead by prizefighting and Television as to what fighting and self defense is? know that if you are one of ,""THEM"", then this book is for you, its actually good for that reason. However if you are educated in realizing that the Brazilians do Judo and not a ,""jutsu"" and training for the ring, whether it be full contact or not - has nothing to do with survival, unless you plan to fight people that have no fighting skills. My point- Strangle holds take time, therefore not suited for self defense or on the battle field fighting multiple attackers- because a few seconds is too much time when your life is on the line. In the ring one on one- it doesnt matter. In reality - holds and stangles only occur in the ring and dojo- on the street , in war or to save your life you break or kill becasue you have once moment to save your life or die."
3,"Puzzling, but Inspiring","I do agree that this particular book was puzzling at best. The multiple story threads confused me, though in some places I could see where they tied together. Something must be said for the good quality of the descriptive writing, though...as a prospective writer myself, I do enjoy a detailed story. Whoever wrote this, whether or not Clancy was indeed among them, did take care to describe the places in which the story takes place, and to describe the character of the people involved. I was inspired to work on my character development, as is portrayed in this book, and to better describe places and machinery and other objects that are involved. However, the descriptiveness of a story counts for little if the storyline is set askew, confusing the reader. So, yes...I liked this book, but...it could have been organized or concluded better."
2,Not up to Clancy standard,"The plot was lost in the excessive descriptive narratives. It was not up to the standard of Clancy's books nor even the standard of the others in the Power Plays series. However, the description of activities in Antarctica was interesting in that it was reminiscent of the time I spent there in the late 80s. The chronicles of Uplink International have been interesting up to now. Better luck with the next book in the series....I hope."
2,COLD WAR,"Obviously not one of Clancy's best. Preisler is not a Clancy. Story dragged due to much descriptive narrative, lacking in the usual person to person interplay I expect from Clancy books. Hope he will go back to writing his own material."
4,"Best screensaver ever, plus carousel to alternate savers","I love my aquarium screensaver. I haven't seen another to compare to the realistic images and fantastic full color in this one. People ask me if it is a film of real fish all the time (it is not a film!). It is gorgeous and each fish has its own style. There are bunches of beautiful fish, realistic backgrounds and tank styles to choose from. I let mine run at random, so it is always different but it can be set to use only certain fish, bacgrounds and etc. It also has a carousel program, allowing you to have different screensavers at random. Just check the different ones you want to run in setup. The kids love it too! I am running mine on Vista now, works just as well as it did on XP."
2,Bad Customer Service,I'm not reviewing the product here as much as I ma the company. The thing was slightly damaged out-of-box... getting support from the manufacturer is proving to be quite a challnge. It's a simple problem easily resolved... but their support and assembly instructions are sub-par.
5,Echolalia to be released in USA,"I thought I'd drop a quick line with echolalia's impending release in the USA on Oct 8th by NYC record label Red Ink. Frontman Paul Dempsey is spellbinding on disk and live. In many ways those overseas have the luck of experiencing SFK as a largely ""unknown"" band where you can stand a foot from stage and look into the band's eyes (memories of my first SFK gig) to the sold out venues like festival hall (memories of my last SFK gig). However, there is always the solace of Paul's solo gigs. And as always I have travelled off onto my own tangent.SFK is an experience which I am yet to find a comparison. The songs are beautifully crafted and powerful with an intelligent songwriting style which is hard to find in the mass of popular culture. So enjoy my northern neighbours"
3,It's only OK.,"The information is OK, but the map its so big. In not practical.La información es correcta, pero el mapa es demasiado grande y esta impreso en una sola cara. No es lo más práctico."
3,Examine Your Motivation,"This rating is based on how well the book met my expectations. If you are honestly ready and focused on joining the ranks of Zuckerman, Shorenstein, Zell, or Trump, then a book like this might serve well as a type of guide post. You would then be dealing with projects in the $100 million plus range. If, however, your focus is on the lower end of the spectrum ... like financing apartment buildings under $5 million - with or without the aid of an investment group - you will not gain much in the way of practical knowledge from this book"
3,"Good, but hardly essential.","I can't say I'm all that disappointed in this album, just not particularly excited by it.I love a Drag in D Flat, track 3... and really all 3 songs recorded in 2000, as they sound sort of in-between Through Being Cool and Stay What you are, which are my favorite two albums by Saves the Day. Track 1 is excellent and sounds right off of Stay What you Are.Of course, all the tracks from the acoustic EP are very good, but... I already own that cd. In fact I'm not sure why they're considered rarities, as thats an easily obtained album. Ugh. I guess I was really hoping for more stuff that was harder to track down. The live track is nice, and if it was recorded at the show in Asbury Park NJ that kicked off the TBS/Saves the Day fall tour then I was at that show, which is pretty cool... but then again, I heard that track twice on that tour. Oh well. If you're a big fan of the band, this is a nice little cd to add to the collection, but its certainly not essential in any way."
2,DISAPPOINTED!,"I am a big fan of shoegazer and dream pop music. I came across these guys and bought the cd after hearing only one song and was disappointed when I finally received in the mail. Most of the songs themselves are pretty good music wise, but the lyrics and vocals are horrible. They are so cheesy. The lyrics were obviously something leftover from a biology folder in junior high. The vocals are not your typical dreamy shoegazer style either; they are loud and obnoxious with a bunch of yeahs and heys. The British were definitely better at pulling off this style of music. Stick to artists released on Creation, Caroline or 4AD!"
2,I don't get it....,"I bought this recording because I happen to be playing in the orchestra for a run of this show. I couldn't make sense out of my own part when practicing, and hoped that listening to the recording would help. I was sorely disappointed. Frank Loesser must have real trauma in his life while writing this disaster. I wouldn't listen to this again if you paid me. The reason for my rating is:* - Musical**** - performance** - Overall rating"
2,Beasts of the Southern Yawn,"Trying to be somewhat nice but extremely over-long and boring film. Interesting for an hour but never goes anywhere. Don't believe the hype. Okay film but nothing worthy of such critical praise. Comments from filmgoers walking out: we paid to see that because? Well, the reviews said it was good."
2,Racist,"Unbelievable characters in the Louisiana/Mississippi gulf area. It had a good theme with lots of variation from it, but the child character seemed to be loved to a level of abuse by an alcoholic father. lots of improvements could be made with this one without humiliating southern people."
5,Terrific!!!!,A excellent performance by all actors. This movie displayed a culture many of us do not know about. This movie is both enlightening and loving. It demonstrates how survial exists in all aspects of human societies.
3,Troubling,"Yes, Hushpuppy was adorable, but I was troubled by the abuse portrayed so artfully in the film. Her abandonment, her use of a blowtorch, the glorification of intense alcohol consumption, the physical abuse. Also, I believe ""Beasts"" has a double meaning--the boars, for sure--but does it also refer to the people? I was expecting a spirit-lifting artsy film, but I saw a depressing, but intriguing, film."
5,BRILLIANT,"You have to be in the mood to watch this think outta the box movie. If you have a open mind, you will see why the young girl deserved to be noticed by Oscar! I think I will my my new puppy Hushpuppy!Enjoy!"
5,Absolutely wonderful,"This a different kind of movie, but an absolutely fabulous one. A friend and I try to see all of the Oscar nominated movies every year (and even some that aren't). I've seen Lincoln, Argo, and Beast of the Southern Wild. All of them are really good and all of them are really different. I find that to be a good thing. It took me a little while to get into this movie, maybe because it seemed so real and documentary-like. It is absolutely worth the watch."
4,Powerful!,"Little Hushpuppy makes her poor and dismal life seem almost magical. The movie tugs at your heart as you experience the complex emotions evoked by family and community, all the little moments both tragic and blissful, through the eyes of the little powerhouse newly revealed in its star, Quvenzhane Wallis."
5,Enchanting,"I loved the way this movie blended imagination and reality. There were several layers to the story -- about humanity, poverty, corruption, the way people treat each other for better and worse -- and the actors, including the child star Quvenzhane Wallis, made them all feel powerful.I'd recommend for those who don't need a perfect or stereotypical happy ending to enjoy a story, as well as for those who enjoy a bit of magic mixed in with their tragedies."
2,Not my kind of movie. Didn't see the point of it.,I just didn't get it. The movie wasn't my kind of movie. It didn't make me laugh or cry or anything.
2,Disappointed,"I did not like this movie. I watched once and donated it to my library. It felt like a thinly veiled reference to hurricane Katrina. The sadness of the movie overwhelmed me. The movie was not helped by the speech of the natives. Many people liked the movie, but it left me disappointed."
1,Only got nominated for its liberal overtones; very bad movie,"The little girl was not good enough to get nominated for the Oscars. The amount of subtle environmentalist nonsense was overwhelming. I'm not stupid, I know propaganda when I see it. The movie just had no point. It was basically poverty porn, like Winter's Bone. If you're a yuppie that grew up wealthy, this might be great stuff to you. For everyone else, just skip it. It's a bad movie."
2,Disappointed,Loved the little girl staring in it but did not like the movie . This movie just wasn't what I expected after all the reviews I had seen on tv.
2,Overly hipped Beast is really a dog,"Well the Academy is at it again going nuts over a film that lacks content except for an overt message on global warming.Other than an okay, but not great, acting job by a little girl the rest of the movie actually sucks.Glad I didn't waste more money going and seeing this in a theater....."
3,Almost like a cult film,"I was a young adult in the 60s and it didn't seem to be part of what really happened then but a good story and good screenplay for sure. I wouldn't have paid to see this in the theaters, for sure."
2,Totally overrated in all categories,"As a movie and the acting, this picture has been totally overrated. Usually I enjoy this type of movie, but this one was not very good on the whole...had some good parts but a lot of melodramatic parts. The fact that the girl was nominated for best actress is ridiculous...it was good acting but it's still just a gifted little girl doing her thing."
2,Why make this movie,"I've seen poverty before. It is not pretty. This movie is not pretty either, nor is it enjoyable. I don't recommend it."
2,Boring,I had heard amazing things about this movie. A couple of nights ago I decided to watch it and I ended up turning it off half way through. It was so boring it made me want to go to sleep. Skip this movie.
3,Voyeuristic,"The cinematography is terrific, mixing the wild beasts with the people living in terrible conditions put me off as did the use of the little girl."
1,Don't bother,"Yes ,there are people who live this way - somehow Hollywood thinks this is romantic. It isn't. Depressing. Don't bother!"
3,"""Gallingly overrated""","I thoroughly agree with how Chuck Bowen summed up this film:""The most gallingly overrated film of the year, Beasts of the Southern Wild is a comfortable middle-class fantasy of the moral purity of abject poverty.""Do read the entire review at slantmagazine.com (Nota: I have no ties whatsoever to this reviewer or website.)"
2,I got bored with it.,"After all the hype, I just found it okay. Maybe I wasn't in the mood, but it just did not capture my attention."
3,A little too beastly,"Although I thought it was well done, I was looking for a more uplifting movie. It was quite a downer."
5,Finally a movie worth watching!,"I really enjoyed this movie! I never write reviews but,Quvenzhane' Wallis was exceptional! Give this movie a chance you will not be disappointed!"
5,sweet,"I had no idea this movie was out there to be seen, I'm so glad I found! I hope everyone sees it, they will be happy they did!!"
4,Good movie,"I wasn't crazy about the content, and the way it is filmed (too shaky), but the acting is phenomenal! Quvenshane Wallis is amazing!"
3,weird,this was a pretty weird movie. wasn't crazy about it..i got it because the little girl was nominated for an award
2,"degrading and disappointing, plus the streaming sucked - kept reloading - ridiculous","degrading and disappointing, plus the streaming sucked - kept reloading - too bad it was so disappointing. The little c"
2,Nice scenery but it put me to sleep,"I kept hoping the movie would get better...but it didn't seem to. I enjoyed the scenery and the music at the end. I fell asleep and had to re-watch the last part. I felt like I wasted my time and money. The acting was good, just the story and the plot took a nose dive in my humble opinion."
1,Beast of Southern Wild,"I preordered 2 copies from Amazon because I had previously seen the movie which was outstanding. My disappointment was in the cheap packaging, DVD very thin, and both copies had that freezing within the movie. It was like buying a Bootleg DVD that would have cost $5 instead of what I paid at Amazon"
1,Not an enjoyable movie,"I watched this movie because it had been nominated for Best Picture for the 2013 Oscars. I was bitterly disappointed. The story is not particularly enjoyable, and it is filmed in a way that feels like you are watching a home video. The cinematography is not beautiful in any way. The story didn't have much of a plot to speak of, and I really didn't get it. This movie is only going to appeal to a very narrow audience that happens to enjoy the art film genre. Don't go into this with your expectations set too high. I have rarely been this disappointed in a Best Picture selection."
2,Incoherent and Pretentious,"Do not believe the critical raves and award nominations. This thing starts out somewhat intriguing and gets progressively absurd. The 6 year old lead actress is not to blame. I give it 5 eye rolls,"
2,Strange,"I expected a lot more from this, given all the media hype. Confusing and not enjoyable to watch. Maybe just not my style."
2,Pointless Story,Pure fantasy and not a very interesting story. The girl is cute but other than that there are no other redeeming charactors.
5,The best!!!,This DVD was the best that we have watched in ages. The storyline was great and the little girl was incredible.
3,good movie but up for best pic?,"I dont know how that happened, but not sure how this movie got nominated as 'best picture'. Its a good movie, but it just doesn't hold up well against the others. Definitely one to see, but I think there's other movies out there that should of gotten the nod over this movie."
3,Fantasy,Great effort from new actors and experienced pros. A fantasy that's not for everyone. Stubbornness in the face of disaster is not admirable. Courage is.
1,Overrated,"Nice glimpse into a world I have not experienced. However, I was expecting much more. The editing of the movie left much to be desired and left me confused at times. Maybe the short story is better and it's just the film that falls short of presenting the story."
3,eh,"interesting and memorable, but bleak and disheartening too. what is supposed to be 'triumph of nature' seems to me more like 'survival despite recklessness'. the supposedly stellar lead actress, while young and so remarkable, really has a rather narrow range."
3,"Amazing acting, just not that enjoyable","The settings and acting in this movie are amazing. It almost feels like you are watching a documentary of these people who live on this island. The little girl who plays Hushpuppie and her Dad are both very good.Regardless, I wasn't stuck to my seat and didn't feel the need to recommend this movie to anyone after viewing it. Well done and acted, just not that enjoyable to view."
2,Why?,"*spoiler*I've been more bored, I guess.I really wanted to like this film, but it's pointless. Stories come from the basics of entertaining and having some kind of purpose. I ask you, after watching this... could you tell this ""story"" and have people entertained? A poor child lives with angry, stupid and lazy people who live their life as a party all of the time and put their lives and those of their children in jeopardy because of squalid living conditions. The predictable storm occurs, they get rescued then escape... just to live in the mud again. The metaphorical beasts rush towards the girl, then Kneel? For what? Because she watched a prostitute cook Gator? I'm sorry... what a complete waste of time. I had just watched Shawshank Redemption last night, and maybe that killed any redeeming qualities this movie may have had for me."
1,Wasted my time,The film is trying to tell us that people choose to live in miserable conditions. I do not believe it. Besides this film is not artistic at all.The actress of the little girl performed very well.
1,BEASTS RUN UNEXPLAINED,"I DIDN'T ACTUALLY HATE THIS PIOCTURE BECAUSE IT DID INTRODUCE ME TO A REGION OF THE COUINTRY ENTIRELY UNFAMILIAR TO ME. BUT I DO LOOK FOR SOME SEMBLANCE OF PLOT AND CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT WHICH PROMPTS BELIEVABLE MOTIVATION FOR THE ACTION. IT NEDED A COHERENT SCREREN PLAY AND EDITRING THAT MADE SOME SENSE. AND WHERE DID THESE BEASTS COME FROM? MY FRIEND, WHO WATCHED IT WITH ME AGRERED THAT WE TURN IT OFF ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGFH. THEN WE RELENTED AND WATACHED THE ENDING. STILL MADE LITTLE SENSE. THE YOUNG GIRL DID TURN IN AN AMAZING PERFORMANCE FOR HER AGE (6), BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TO HOLD MY INTEREST. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE."
2,Quvenzhané Wallis...,"Give the kid a ""mini"" Oscar... but movie is too slow paced. Great insight into the ""bathtub"" society and how they survive without any government help!"
2,I didn't get it,"Despite a charismatic child star, this movie didn't engage me. What is the point of the story? What is the past/present/future of the cast of characters. How do these drunks and castoffs feed themselves or maintain their supply of fuel and liquor? Why should we care? Where is child protective services?"
4,Out of the Ordinary Good,"Unbelievably well acted. The story line is sad and hopeless and triumphant and delightful and depressing and disturbing and moving and enriching ALL at the same time. Only because it's probably true and the acting of the little girl and her dad is so real it seems we spied rather than watched a movie.Not light hearted or entertaining but important to watch. Especially for bored, dissatisfied, overindulged middle class America. Amazing what can be a source a pride when it's all you have. And interesting what we will defend when it's all we know."
3,Hushpuppy Is a Miracle!,But I could not stand the way she was treated. I could not stand the poverty and danger that these folks lived in. I hated the drinking and the trash. But I liked the child's hopeful spirit!
