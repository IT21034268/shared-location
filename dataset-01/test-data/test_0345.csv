2,Not the best,"It is poorly constructed. When you throw knives at it, it falls apart. When throwing knives you need to constantly keep pushing it together. Not a very good deal for the price."
1,Garbage,I failed to read the reviews prior to making the purchase. The board lasted about 25 throws before complete falling apart. This is junk
3,Runs down quickly,"I ordered this battery because my other batteries for my video camera would die quickly. This one does the same thing. It might be because of my camera, but it's not that old. Very cheap...but you get what you pay for."
1,Defective battery,"I have purchased 2 battery, part no.BP-408cl from DIGITAL.One (1) of the battery is defective. Can't be charged.I have tried multiple time and has no luck, still defective. I can't return the battery, because it is about 32 days after purchased.Not recommended to purchase this part, not too happy. Thank you."
3,a 50% price increase is uncalled for,"I love this Kindle edition. As a subscriber I expect the same priveleges as a print subscriber; mainly access to the Journal Online. When the recent price increase was announced I thought for sure this oversight was being rectified. Sadly, no such luck."
1,You want me to pay again?,"I have a paid subscription to the Wall Street Journal, WSJ.com, and the Tablet Edition for Android.Could not wait to read it on my new Fire.Sorry...that will cost me another 15/month.That is what I call a bunch of crap!"
2,Can't share between two Kindles - Not like reading the paper with someone,"While this is great if you just want to get the Journal and get your reading done, it suffers from drawbacks that make it less useful than getting the Print/Web edition for $99 -- remember, this is $120 for the year.We have two Kindle's in the house....it's annoying that I can't deliver it to both of them, even though books can be shared amongst 5 Kindles. This is particularly frustrating because it takes away the whole ritual of having coffee and ""reading the paper together"".Also, as previously stated, you don't get online access...I've contacted Fox and WSJ and written a couple of letters...still, no dice after almost a year.This is really only for people who just want to read the paper by themselves, and don't have a need to search the online WSJ on a topic."
2,Too expensive,"The Kindle version of the Wall Street Journal is handy for travel, especially on airplanes where the room to fold/unfold a newspaper freely isn't available. But the price just doubled. Now the only time I will buy it is for travel; it's cheaper at the newstand down the street."
2,Confusing layout,"Good content, which is why I read the Journal. But fairly confusing layout, unlike the actual layout of the paper. Hard to get from one article to another article. Sometimes one loses track of where one is within the paper."
4,Why is Kindle WSJ cost same as print version?,"I am very happy with WSJ on the Kindle. I can easily pick out the articles I want to read and no longer have stacks of unread newspapers laying around. One question, why is the $9.99/mo the same price as their print edition (at least it was their online ""special"" price today)? By subscribing via Kindle I'm saving them delivery and print costs."
1,WSJ on the Kindle is short on contenct and long on pricing,"Just received Kindle 2 and ordered the WSJ on it.1) pricing for the WSJ is way too high2)'Experimental' music feature is really pathetic.3) Browsing with the Kindle is terrible.4) only good feature is ink/screen which is easy on the eyes.Given that the Kindle 2 is in its second generation I would say the designers and engineers fell well short of a solid product.I would buy a competitor's product which has touch screen, etc."
2,Rip-Off,"The Wall Street Journal purchased through Kindle was priced at .99 cents in the past. After my latest purchase I realized that the purchase price had risen to $1.99! Is this an error, or just greed?"
2,Not all of us live in New York,"I liked the idea of Kindle WSJ. I've been an avid print reader for several years, and liked having it delivered electronically early every morning and not having used papers stack up. It was portable and easy to read. However finding articles was clumsy and I found myself falling out of the habit of reading it. I also found a large number of sections and articles relating to the Greater New York area. Since I live on the West Coast, and rarely travel to NY, those articles are of little interest. My print edition used to have sections unique to the SF Bay area. I tried to find a way to regionalize my electronic subscription, but evidently there is only a one size fits all version! I just don't see the quality of this for the cost."
1,Just Cancelled My Subscription,"This was one of my first Kindle purchases when I got my device in April. I just cancelled it.Two major issues I have with this product:1. Kindle WSJ is more that $40 per year greater cost than an online/print WSJ combination subscription. Where is the logic in that decision?2. Value inconsistent with experience (see #1)... Small screen, big newspaper, poor navigation model (albeit as much by device design)"
2,Kindle version costs too much!,"I've long been enjoying the paper version, and would like to have the convenience of the kindle version for when I'm traveling, and to not have to get rid of all that paper that accumulates.When I was researching to buy the Kindle, the price for WSJ was $9.99, a little high, but within reach. Now the price increase takes all the goodness out of getting this subscription, and part of the reason why I bought the Kindle DX in the first place. If WSJ and Amazon want to increase income, the lower price should increase sales and revenue. I simply will not pay that much for Kindle on-line WSJ."
3,Good Product...Poor Value at New Price,"The Wall Street Journal is a great newspaper. I subscribe at the office and have been getting the Kindle version as well. At the old price, the Kindle version was an acceptable value...especially when I travel.At the new price, however, the value is no longer there. I guess I will just go back to my hard copy of the WSJ."
1,Another dissatisfied customer,"I have to say that the quality of the WSJ has been slipping since it was taken over by News Corp. Moreover, I now see some of the editorial bias of their opinion pages slipping into their news coverage. Yet, given that it remained the preeminent business paper in the US, I still subscribed. A 50% price increase, however, has pushed me over the edge. Who in their right mind would consider a 50% price increase appropriate in this economy?"
1,Disappointed/Cancelling due to Price change in moving to Fire,"I got a Kindle Fire and had much trouble ""moving"" my subscription from my DX to the Kindle Fire and decided to cancel on the DX and restart on the Fire as I could not find the ""edit"" button as indicated after deregistering my DX. When I went to resubscribe the price jumped from $15 to $18.29 (now I see why they would not let be ""tranfer"" the subscription) I don't like the poke in the eye to a loyal customer on this one. You guys will learn exactly where the elasticity of revenue from me and my subscription is with a 22% increase (or $39.60 per year) above the previous price of about $180. Sorry - let me know if you rethink the price."
3,Pricey and only one version (NY),"I traded my newspaper for the Kindle edition, and I am pleased with most of the content, and ease of reading. I do not like however that the graphics (charts are not readable), and there is no ability to zoom in. In addition, my physical copy of the WSJ was a Midwest edition, the Kindle version has a lot of local New York material that I have no need for. When you are paying 15 bucks a month, which is similar to the introductory delivery price, I assume there should be parity between the products."
3,They raised the price. Are you kidding me?,"I can't believe they jacked up the price 50 percent. Are they trying to make people unsubscribe? I can get the print edition for [...] bucks a month, is there some benefit that the newspaper is getting from destroying trees and extra manpower printing papers. I know they get extra ad space but come on print is dying why not try and support the new medium for media rather than squashing the new users. This just doesn't make sense and is freaking annoying."
1,Disappointed,"I was just looking at purchasing the Wall Street Journal for my Kindle and was STUNNED by the price tag. I thought getting this paper on the Kindle would be less expensive than the home delivered edition. All I can say is thanks, but no thanks. I will not subscribe at this price to the Kindle Edition."
1,Subscription Change,"I received a great email this morning from Amazon informing me that my subscription was going from $9.99 to $14.99. Wow! Really!?! Subscription subsequently cancelled.This fee was already higher than an online subscription and for this $9.99/month fee we got less than the online subscription. I only continued the subscription because I liked the convenience.This has to hurt both Amazon and the Wall Street Journal. I'm even considering putting the Kindle 2 on ebay. Thanks Amazon and WSJ, you're awesome.I won't be recommending the Kindle for this service any time soon at these prices."
1,Rip off!!!,"This is a good product, and one of the reasons I bought my Kindle. I travel too much to take the WSJ in paper form, so this was perfect - until they raised the price. The price was already too high at $9.99/mth, since that's the same price I can get it in paper form. I mean, they should pass on some of their cost savings to the subscriber, or at least offer a package Kindle/Internet subscription price break. So, at $9.99 they were already skimming us, but I bought it anyway. At this new price, I feel like they're bending me over a barrel. Seriously more than the paper subscription costs - are you kidding me? I'm dropping my subscription.I wish I could have focused my review on the good side of the WSJ Kindle version, but the price gouge ticks me off too much to even share a bit of positive news about it."
4,Worth the subscription price,"Most of the negative reviews of the WSJ Kindle edition concern the $14.99 per month price. But to me it's worth it. I don't mind paying for the convenience of having it wirelessly delivered early each morning to my Kindle, which is smaller and more convenient to carry than my laptop. And no wifi is needed."
4,"All of the articles, none of the fluff.","Firstly, the title isn't meant to insult the pictures and other additions of the print version. I actually kind of like the fluff. The Journal's articles are always there in their entirety, along with most of the pictures. The introductory price of the print version is cheaper, but the permanent rate is not. I think this is equivalent to the online version with fewer pictures and daily delivery. I like having the Journal there when I wake up, and the articles are in their entirety. The reporting is just as good, even though the format can seem awkward at times. The format is particularly awkward when the portraits take up half a page, interrupting an article. I would like to see the price come down, but Amazon's share is the difference between it and the online version. The reporting is worth the expense, even if the print version is better."
1,Pricing is terrible,"I agree with other reviewers. Pricing does not make sense. I used to have kindle version but decide to change it to paper+internet because I only have to pay $100 per year for both. When the price increases to $15 per month, it has became difficult to justify the price when comparing to paper+internet"
1,Subscription is way too expensive!!!,While the application is totally buggy and crashes on a regular basis. When it does work the articles have great content. That being said I think WSJ is way to overpriced and needs to realign with the rest of the newspaper subscriptions. The programers are having some real difficulties with the format. Why else would a company charge twice what every other newspaper charges and then offer no discounts when the paper version on a six month subscription is half the cost. WSJ start living in the current times. This version should save a ton on overhead costs and shipping costs. Hire some stable dependable programmers and get your costs in line.
1,Wall Street Journal,"Reception of the Journal is sporatic. Example: during the week of July 27, I received the paper on Monday and Tuesday but it did not download on Wed. or Thur. This is a constant problem. Some weeks it comes every day with no problem other weeks I only get two or three issues out of six. If the problem is not rectified in a couple weeks I will cancel my subscription. Posted 7/30/2009."
1,How to price a newspaper out of success,"I enjoyed reading the WSJ for several months...until they decided to go from $9.99 to 14.99 overnight. A financial paper should be able to grasp the concept: If you charge more for the Kindle edition than your promotion for paper AND online access, in a world of connected phones, netbooks, notebooks and WiFi all around people are going to drop the Kindle version.I'm going to find another paper to read while they review their subscription figures and drop the price back down."
1,Ridiculous cost,"I love my new Kindle2. I am not impressed, however, with the monthly cost of the Wall Street Journal. I'd dearly love to have it waiting for me when I wake in the morning, but $15/mo is out of line. I'll stick to my principles and wait until Amazon/Whispenet revise the price to 9.99 like many of the other papers.Or, wait--the other, cheaper papers are all politically slanted very much to the left. Is the price of the WSJ higher to prevent/punish us from reading the opposing views? Anyone want to suggest another reason why the WSJ is so costly?"
2,Purchased 1 issue on Kindle Keyboard - but cannot see on Fire?,I purchased one issue for $1.99 on my Kindle Keyboard. But I could not look at it on my Kindle Fire. How come? Every other newspaper or magazine I've purchased on my Kindle Keyboard I've been able to view on my Kindle Fire. I did download the WSJ app on my Kindle Fire - but was still unable to look at that one issue I purchased; the app just kept demanding a subscription.Why is the WSJ different this way? Am I missing something?
3,No Pictures,"The Kindle edition is pretty good, except there are no pictures (unlike the NYT Kindle Edition). That's a dissapointment and probably is why it is $5 cheaper than the New York Times."
2,OK but TOO restrictive,"This is it, the big kahuna of financial newspapers delivered right to your Kindle. You do not even need to get out of bed or off the throne to retrieve a soggy paper version from your snowed in yard.Just read it right there on your beloved Kindle.The problem is the high price for what you get and the pesky DRM content that you have to put up with.All the Kindle content is like this. This is the evil DRM inherent in the Kindle. It only lets you view the content on the Kindle. No printing articles, no emailing articles to a friend, no using it in presentations. You are stuck. Very evil is it not !So, if you can live with the price and restrictions of DRM then go for it my friend."
1,Amazon does a bait and switch!,"If you purchased the Kindle to get a reduced rate on the WSJ, like I did in part, you will be very disappointed to learn that they just raised the rate from $9.99 to $14.99. Since AMAZON sets the rate for all subscriptions, this seems to me to be a potential pattern for all their Kindle-version subscriptions. I have to wonder if book prices will be next!"
1,Why won't this apply to Kindle Fire?,"Love getting the Wall Street Journal daily, but it won't allow me to send it to my new Kindle Fire. So, have discontinued subscription for now. One or no-star rating till it becomes available on the Kindle Fire."
3,compares cost kindle to online,"folks, i get print and online (ipad/web etc) for $38 per quarter. kindle version is $21/month - very pricy but as you know its a download. i opted to keep it in print and ipad (color) vs my b/w kindle."
3,Same Old Pricing Complaints,I first got turned onto the kindle when my WSJ got delivered too late at my apartment. So I either had to take a later train or find another way to get the paper. So I bought kindle and loved it for a little while until the price/month nearly doubled. I cancelled my subscription and haven't gone back since. I don't understand how they can charge so much more than the print delivery for the Kindle WSJ. Even the print delivery price with the online access beats the kindle price. From what I've read it's because Amazon demands a chunky fee and it's not the publishers fault.I've moved to a new apartment so I may switch back to the print version. I'm unsure what I'll end up doing.
1,often undelivered,i love my kindle but i find it unreliable when it comes to delivering the wall street journal.
1,WSJ for Kindle 2,"I cancelled my WSJ Print Edition after I got my Kindle 2 a few months ago. At $9.99 it seemed to be a better deal... While the articles are the same, there is something to be said for reading newspapers in paper form. I LOVE the Kindle 2 for book... however, for WSJ and newspapers in general, it is just simply not that desirable. While we may complain about the advertisements in WSJ, I actually miss those as well as most other graphics that are omitted from the Kindle edition. I also think the increase in price make this completely out of the question given the other problems."
1,The Kindle subscription is way more expensive than a print subscription!,"I just realized a couple of days ago that the Kindle subscription is much higher than the print subscription. This really made it feel as if the paper is trying to balance its declining subscriber base on my back. If you add to that the slightly irksome right-wing editorials, my switch to the FT Kindle edition was a no-brainer."
2,Not updated during the day,Buyer beware: This is literally the print edition for the day and never updates throughout the day.. So this is no replacement for the online version. I canceled after the two-week trial to spend the money on continuously updating blogs such as Techcrunch on the Kindle.
1,Kindle Swindle Would be 5 stars if no DRM: Defective By Design FAIL,I do not buy Kindle books or use Kindle e-reader devices. Amazon's Kindle is a Swindle because of its DRM. Products like these intentionally use DRM to dumb users down and restrict fair use rights. Therefore they are defective by design. I understand the convenience of using e-books and having an e-book reader if your traveling you don't have to carry 10 or more heavy paperback or hardcover books but at least with printed books you own a copy of the book not a license to access which can be revoked as Amazon has already done by remotely deleting George Orwell's 1984 from Kindles. It doesn't matter that in the outrage they apologized for it the fact they have the technical capability to do so is troubling and wrong.
1,14.99?!,"So I don't currently have a Kindle... I have considered buying one for the primary reason of reading the WSJ. I currently have the WSJ delivered, every single day, for a student discount of $24.99. I would love to purchase the Kindle and WSJ, but it just doesn't make sense. If the price drops on BOTH, I may reconsider. Until then, long live the iPad!"
1,Formerly loyal... ex subscriber,"I LOVED the Kindle 2 version of the WSJ... then they raised the price. I paid the penalty for a month, but in the end, it's not worth it.Amazon - please don't let the Dow Jones company do this!!!"
1,Too Expensive,"My Combination Online/Print version of the WSJ cost $160 per year. The kindle version alone will run me $180 per year. I might buy single issues for .99 a day on vacation but otherwise, I guess I'll keep filling up the landfills. At the old $100 per year I would have switched. Amazon...are you listening???"
1,Too Expensive,"The WSJ is more than print edition, more than online. Not worth the cost and not as good. No upside, cancelled."
4,Wall Street Journal- a great kindle buy,"I just bought a kindle and am on a trial subscription to the kindle Wall Street Journal- So far I am thrilled and am puzzled by the overall two star rating given by overall reviewers. I find the articles, especially front page and opinion, very informative and interesting. I had had a print subscription to WSJ but cancelled due to small print size- not a problem with the kindle- And having a "" New York"" section is an added bonus- Price is worth it- a bit more than the Washington Post and $5.00 less per month than the NY Times. Well written, informative- a good buy. AM Colorado"
1,Way overpriced,"I have been evaluating the WSJ for Kindle the past couple of weeks and it seems crazy to pay more for an electronic issue that is worse than the print version. Originally I thought that it would be great to ""go green"" and eliminate a ton of paper each year. On the Kindle the WSJ at best is only slightly less readable than paper but if they offered it at a discound to paper it would be worth considering. What I do find interesting is that it has been many months since anyone has reviewed using the WSJ on the Kindle. Maybe everyone figured out it is a rip off!"
1,way too expensive - just get the paper,one would think they could offer it cheaper as they don't have to print it.
2,Overpriced - costs more than WSJ online!,"This version of the Wall Street Journal is a rip-off. It costs $5 more a month than the online version of the paper, and is missing market tables and other items (which could be important to students who are required to subscribe to the paper). It is very difficult to look through the paper for articles that may be on a specific page (or to query by article title). There are numerous typos and formatting issues. All in all, it's not worth it. I wanted to like this because I love WSJ and I love the Kindle, but there's a lot of work that needs to be done before this is a good option for the WSJ reader."
1,where the @/@/ do i unsubscribe,how covenient. they give you two weeks for free but then unsubscibing is harder than deciphering the rosseta stone... thanks guys
1,Unusable,Both Plug 'n Play installation and the supplied CD Driver installer repeatedly hang Windows XP SP2. The modem is unusable. I'm returning it.
3,Cheap is not always cheerful,The ball was good to start with but with time it went out of shape - started bulging on on side. Was good when it lasted.
1,"""Has Been"" Julia","Annette Benning gives a stellar performance but one is always conscious that it ""is"" Ms. Benning. Ultimately, this film is unsatisfying because I did not care about any of the characters."
1,Madonna should have played the part,"of the middle aged b with divatude.I'm googling Somerset Maugham right now to see if he was gay because only that would excuse such a hollow, soulless, narcissistic character being treated as a diva with an indomitable spirit worthy of a teary standing ovation.The google results have come in. Yes, it seems he probably was, but tried to avoid Oscar Wilde's fate by being more discreet. Do I get some kind of prize?Now for the good news. If you take it as farce it is okay. It is well shot and costumed. The English son of the aging actress has a great part and did a good job with it. Actors were generally fine, although just like Moulin Rouge, this is one part that Madonna could actually handle because she wouldn't have to act.I gave it one star for the theme and what it presented as worthy of celebration-- even if it was half-farcical."
5,Wow!,"This film is a complete and utter delight from start to finish! I found it at my library and have watched it three times in a row -- every time I see and hear more subtlety. The story is a wonderful romp through the ups and downs of one woman's mid-life crisis without being cliche or maudlin. Bravo to Annette Benning for the courage to keep her own face and not get alot of expression-freezing plastic surgery as she ages. She is more beautiful and radiant than ever, because she is real, and even more accomplished at her craft. Kudos also to Jeremy Irons and the rest of the cast for great acting. Benning indeed should have had the Oscar for this tour de force. I'm buying the movie, the soundtrack and the novella by Maughm."
2,Stained Our Tub,"We found these VERY difficult to clean off of our porcelain tub. They are based on wax ingredients, which may be part of the difficulty. And I agree with the other reviews. There is a lot more packaging than necessary, and it hides the small amount of product. Not a good value. They were easier to clean out of our sink; our child did love drawing with them. I am guessing there are better products out there; perhaps soap crayons."
1,bad crayons get others,These do not draw on people. They are just weird crayons. They contain a LOT of wax and are very hard to clean off the bathroom. They also bleed.
1,Waste of money!,"Melted right away! My poor 3 yo did not even have a chance to use it in the tub. I bought 3 boxes and will return the unused ones as soon as I get a chance! The previous products did not melt, but maybe they just changed manufacturers."
1,Candy Girl,This book is an utter waste of time to read. Absolutely vulger in its content. I could have lived my whole life without reading a book of this kind. Can not be rated even one star. Should be thrown in the trash and burned.
5,Witty and fun!,"Graphic at times but very real and honest, this book was a quick and enjoyable read. Cody brings readers into a world they would never go on their own, providing insight along the way, just what books are meant to do."
4,Any story involving a panty auction is required to be told.,"Before she wrote the screenplay forJuno, Diablo Cody wrote this book based on her experiences as a stripper and a peep show girl. The book is told in the snarky style of that movie. I know some people don't like that kind of writing, but I find it amusing. She details all the weird, funny, disgusting details of working in the sex industry. I liked it, but your mileage may vary."
2,Just didn't get it,"I can only guess at the writer's motivations for writing this book, which offers a tacky insight into the sad world of strip clubs in a style that blends hippy slang with words and references I never heard of."
5,All strippers or former strippers MUST read this book!,"I loved it and read it in a few days! I wish I could get my patents to read it so they could understand the nature of exotic dancer today. And, for those of you who like your work as a dancer, this book defines the life and work of a stripper who enjoyed her job. It helped me to understand why I loved dancing and that I am normal for loving it!"
2,Irritating,"The tone of this book was so self-important it made me a little embarrassed for the author. Her writing style reminded me of a precocious high-schooler's. It's funny--I enjoy Diablo Cody's voice in film, but it just annoys the hell out of me on the printed page. She's like the anti-Chuck Klosterman.I'm only giving this two stars because it was a fast read (I finished it while my 3-month-old napped)."
3,Beautiful singing but . . .,"It's great to see this album available on cd. Any fan of Vern Gosdin - which should mean any fan of great country singing - will love hearing the Voice in fine form. However, I found the '80s production to be stiff, almost freeze-dried on some songs. Nevertheless, the lead and harmony singing are so heartfelt and beautiful, and the price is so good, that if you are at all a fan of Vern, this is certainly worth the price."
1,item not received,"It has been quite some time since I ordered this item and to this date still have not received it. I have had no word as to the status of the item. PLEASE let me know something about receiving this item. I am looking forward to getting it but, would like to know why it is taking so long. (The Gospel Album CD) I have had this same item in the past and loved it. I'm sure I would again if I can just receive it. Also, one is a gift for someone else. Thank you, P. Martin"
1,No Mac drivers for dolby pass through,"This device works just fine, but if you want to use the digital output for dolby or dts passthrough on mac os x, forget it. It works with system drivers that do not allow for surround sound"
1,just plain annoying,"The instructor never stops talking the whole entire tape. I can't do the tape, not because it's too difficult, but because her annoying voice is just too irritating. Though there should be advice on proper form, etc., she never stops, not even for a second. I've been doing the beginner's tape by Ana Caban for a while and though her intermediate tape was not rated that highly, I guess I'll have to purchase it because it can't possibly be as annoying as this tape."
2,Misfire,"If, as is advertised in these pages, this is any indication of what their upcoming full-length cd will sound like, many BJM fans will be disappointed, I'm afraid. Simply put, this is significantly inferior in every way to the three BJM cds I know inside and out: Bringing it all back home again; Strung out in Heaven; and ...And this is our music. These three are great. 'We are the radio' pales in comparison (and the new female singer sounds too similar to Grace Slick): repetitive, lacking energy and urgency. Even the one instrumental comes nowhere near the brilliance of 'Heroin and Prozac revisited' off of 'And this is our music'. That's got to be one of the many high points of this extremely talented band. Keeping me fingers crossed- and looking forward to seeing them this May and June (2006)..."
1,Broken zipper,This came with a broken zipper and the other two zippers don't work properly. My daughter however loved it and didn't want my to return it.
5,AWESOME PACK,"Got this pack because I was suddenly needed a lot more supplies. This backpack is strong and large, without being overwhelming in size. can wear it easily, but the shoulder straps are not comfortable for long long periods of time."
2,Ripped mesh side after 3 months!,"Both my girls have only used Jansport backpacks, usually they have the superbreak. My oldest started middle school and needed something bigger, and I bought her this big student pack. She has only been using it for three months and the mesh water bottle holder on the side has lost all the stitching that held it to the bag. Jansport has a lifetime warranty but you have to ship it back to them and that's something I can't do without a replacement. It's hot still here in CA and the kids are told to carry water, so she either has to continue tossing the water in her bag filled with books, or tonight I have to spend time to get this sewed back on by hand so my daughter can use the pocket. Not happy!!!"
5,Exactly What I wanted,I had one of these bags for 6 years during which I did a ton of travelling. I had to replace it when the strap broke (too many books in the bag) but the replacement is great. I don't know any other student backpack that holds as much.
4,Decent Quality,"Sturdy backpack, sticks out from your back a little more than I like but it has plenty of capacity. I recommend this for college students."
4,Arrived the next day!,"Time was quickly disappearing before I needed to head back to school but the backpack arrived the day after I ordered it! It's an amazing backpack, tons of space; unlike LL Bean backpacks, the 2nd-largest compartment is deep enough to be useful. My only wish would be to have a laptop compartment in the back.Note on the color: I ordered guerilla green. When I ordered, amazon.com had two different pages for the backpack and they showed the color being different. The guerilla green is the darker one of the two - not lime green. It's a beautiful, beautiful backpack!"
5,Buenisima,I purchased this backpack for my 12 year old daughter. She is thrilled with it. She loves the fabric design and the colours. All I can say is that it is very good quality. The design of all the pockets are great and very confortable to use.
2,JanSport Big Student Classic Series Backpack,"I have a worn Airzuit model JanSport backpack, which is no longer made. It is more than 15 years old. I went all over the US, Europe, Mexico and Turkey using it as my carry on luggage and day pack. The big Student Classic Series Backpack has flimsy zippers, zipper pulls, and fabric. The shoulder straps had thin, poorly padded straps. I read a review that was critical of this product, but thought that the reviewer was just a complainer. My mistake. I sent it back, and will get a minor repair done my backpack at a luggage repair shop. The Big Student backpack qualifies as a medium grade toy."
3,Allows for lots of books - careful on toting your laptop - no protection,When I purchased this item I was looking for a bigger backpack that would support all the MBA books I have to lug around. The backpack allows for plenty of books and some.Second day I had the back pack full off a chair and busted up my new HP Laptop Ultrabook. I plan on adding some protection to the pocket where I carry laptop. No bottom stabilizing features to hold backpack upright so I suggest laying it flat on table or on ground.
5,Straps took some getting used to,"This bag is exactly what I was expecting from a Jansport bag, having owned several over the years, except I wasn't prepared for the new straps. For the first few days I owned the bag I was pretty sure that they would ruin it for me. They were super-stiff and really dug into a very uncomfortable spot on my shoulder. I was sore there for the first few days I used the bag. At some point either I adapted or the straps did, or both, because now I think it is probably the most comfortable pack I've ever had."
1,Horrible. Horrible.Horrible.,"I ordered the JanSport Big Student Backpack (blinded blue hippy). It looks nothing like the picture. At all. And I can't return it because it arrived the day before school starts. I'm so upsset. In the picture it shows a small amount of green. Let me tell you. It is covered in this ugly dark green. It looks like a boy's backpack. II would not recommend it at all. The straps are soooooo uncomfortable. The only thing good about this backpack is it holds all 6 of my binders. Thats it. Im going to try to bleach some of the green so it'll be lighter, hopefully it makes it look more girly."
4,Even nicer looking in person,"A white backpack that looks great. The flowers are nicer looking in person that in the photo. I do wish they had put black on the bottom rather than white. My daughter has used it for a few weeks, no dirty marks, yet. Great quality construction as well."
5,Red plaid backpack,"I love this backpack! It's big enough for me to fit in my 17"" laptop. On top of that, there are many different compartments where I can put various things, separating them into categories. Jansport produces really sturdy backpacks. Also, my favorite color is red and I love the plaid buffalo design! It's light and easy access!"
5,Nice back pack,I got this for my brother and he loved it. It has lots of space and is very durable. I would recommend this product.
2,Not what I expected,"From all the reviews of this singer, I thought her music would have been better. It's not a CD I listen to often. Not very unique or exciting or different."
5,outstanding book,"this is just an awsome book to read' there is so many interesting photos and stories. to me its breathtakeing... i am a longtime fan of marty stuart' and will always be, i hope he writes a volume II to this book. would be neat to see what else he has to say about this day and time... love ya marty... the rockabilly king you will always be.."
2,unintentional (?) camp,"Because I feel technical/craft deficiencies sink this film, I'm not going to commment on the plot, except to say that the several storylines were not very well integrated. Some bits and pieces of this movie made me wonder what the actors could have achieved with better direction and a better script, but far too often their emotions changed so dramatically and unrealistically within a scene that is was imposible to take them seriously. The music was sappy and distracting, playing so heavily over some scenes as to make the dialogue difficult to understand. It was refreshing to see ""real"" looking actors but what they were given to say was many times laugh-out-loud silly and trite. Not the worst movie I've seen, but one easily skipped."
5,What a WONDERFUL book! I Loved it!,"""How I Fell in Love with a Librarian and Lived to Tell about it"" is a wonderful romantic comedy with a very serious message-- libraries are IMPORTANT! Nothing about this book is predictable-- it will keep you guessing to the end. It really defies genre, being so much more than a romantic comedy. In fact, I would say it's something of an excursion into literary artistry.The story is about the romance that develops between a small town librarian and one of her best customers. One of the sub-plots is about a small town politicians attempt to close the library. The good people of the town join together to fight for the library.This book is a must-have for every library. Seriously."
4,"Great exercise video.. once you learn the moves, that is","This is a great workout. I've done many of the other buns of steel workouts, and it usually takes them too long to get past the basic moves (which is great initially, but becomes boring pretty fast)."
2,ATTENTION! Amazon may send you a used one!,I'm not trying to make a fuss about it. But amazon did send me a used one. The wire and the body are got stained and the package is not sealed and clearly has been opened. The protector functions well so that I decided not to return this but this is still my worst shopping experience with amazon.
2,too easy,"This is almost too easy-- like shooting fish in a barrel. Back in the early 80s, when Keep It Up was released, I thought it was great. ""Hot Girls in Love"" was the radio favorite, and I liked ""Queen of the Broken Hearts"" the best. Now, it all sounds like crap. The synthesizers sound cheesy, the vocals sound strained, and the music sounds like an average hard rock band being played through the speakers of a 1980s video arcade game or a mono television.Loverboy's debut album was better. Sad to say, their later albums were even worse than Keep It Up.Keep It Up? I suppose they couldn't.ken32"
4,Wonderful World of Pet (Dog) Ownership,Are you training your dog or is he/she training you? You can reverse the roles and train them rather than the other way around ;-) This book helps you take command of your dog and make him/her listen with understanding and caring.
3,"Positive, but a bit difficult to apply","I love that this book offers a completely positive training method. However, some of the training ideas seem like they would take a very long time to teach, and I don't know how ""rock-solid"" your dog would be afterward. I like that the author advocates teaching exercises in such a way that your dog cannot fail (for example, don't try making your dog SIT outside until he has done it 90% perfect in the house without distractions). I don't like that it does not offer many suggestions on what to do if you do happen to say ""SIT"" and your dog completely ignores you. And I truthfully didn't think it had very many effective ways to change ""bad"" behaviors. It would be great for your average dog without many bad habits who is willing to please and endlessly interested in treats.The book was easy to read, but I actually got very annoyed with some of the long ""funny"" descriptions. A bit too much padding for me; get to the point."
3,Exactly what you might expect,"The title of this book says it all. As a primer of physics, it is fairly useful and very easy to understand. However it is written by a skeptic and it could have just as easily been titled ""A Skeptics Guide to Physics...""The attitude of the writer is apparent throughout the work and that forces the reader to take everything with a grain of salt. That said, the author is clearly very intelligent and very studied and his use of science to dispute the claims of science fiction makes for an interesting excercise for the reader.Recommended to anyone who enjoys the rhetoric of a text as much as (or more than) the concepts behind it."
3,Dress up,"This dress set was made pretty good, a much better material than the regular pink set that I bought for another girl."
4,artist apron was good,"It covered the child well, keeping him clean. It was also very colorful, to keep him interested in wearing it; also has pockets if you want to hold anything in it."
2,Strange book,"Left to many loose ends. You feel bad for Jean but are left hanging, wanting to know if she ended up ok."
3,Good storyline,"This book had a really great storyline, I'm sure many teenage girls can relate. A lot of touchy subjects but overall a great read !"
1,Disillusionment on paper,"Ok, Verlinden is a good modeller, and quite a prolific too, but this first volume is completely useless.Techniques and modelling tips are very basic (almost poor): just a fiew paragraph, couple of pages and that's it!Diorama next: a lot of pictures, but again, no comments on 'how it's done', just the finished stuff.Overall, it could have been a good book back in the '80s, but today you could easily find much more informations, pictures, tips, step by step guides for free on the internet.For me it has been a complete disillusionment on papaer."
5,Another velinden Must Have!,"Verlinden was among the first of the people who took model building to a whole new level making an art form. ANY book that shows his insights and his how tos is worth the price of admission! This isn't an easy to find book and seldom do you find it at a discounted price, if you find it at all. A most worth buy, especially if are are an up and coming model builder."
5,Bring Empty Nest to DVD. I soooooo miss this TV Show,Empty Nest 1988- 1995 7 SeasonsI was 22 yrs old when this show was produced back in 1988. I just adored this TV sitcom back in the day.It was a great spin-off from the Golden Girls show produced by Susan HarrisI remember Saturday nights back in the day I couldn't wait to watch both shows why can'tthey put good comedy sitcoms like this back on TV anymore. I have been waiting since I boughtall 7 seasons of the Golden Girls for this show to be released on DVD and still they haven'tput it on the market and I ask WHY ??? They put other crap shows on DVD why not this lovablesitcom. Goes to show you they don't know either good TV or what the public would be willing to spendtheir money on. I'm going to buy every season when or if they plan on ever releasing it. Sooooo hurryup and get this show released already. The public wants this out and like yesterday... Get it out of the vaultand put it on a 3 disc set like the Golden Girls. Geeezzzzz.....
1,Wouldn't fit,"I thought that this would fit on my doorknob, but its too small. The distance from the doorknob to the door prevented this from fitting. I thought I had a typical doorknob, but I can't get this to fit."
1,Don't buy this if you live in cold weather!,"If you get ice or snow where you are, avoid buying this because the buttons will freeze, which will not only make it useless but lock you out. This also happened on the GE Access Point lockboxes and I don't know if there is a fix for this."
3,Awesome when it works,"We've had this product for 2 years. It's hanging on our front porch furniture (so outdoors, but in a covered area), and has come in handy a number of times when we have lost our keys, or we want friends and other people to However, I went to use it today and it has become VERY difficult to use. The little switch is nearly impossible to flip open with a finger (I was able to wedge it open with a key) and the little ""door"" was difficult to shut when I was finished using the lock box. I had to put it on a flat surface and use my body weight to get it to shut. I noticed that some of the metal is rusty. Ultimately, I think I'm going to get a new one because it has been so handy. However, if I need a need another new one in 2 years, I'm probably going to try to find a new way to hide a key."
4,heavy and strong,"Does what it's supposed to. I just hope that in the event of an emergency, the EMT's or Firemen will be able to figure out what to slide and what to push and how to get the key out. It's big and heavy and bounces on the door every time i open or close the door. But my key is safe and sound inside of it."
1,No room for my car key,"The box is too small because of the poor design, it wont even take my subaru legacy key, can not fit a credit card, only for regular door keys I guess, so pretty useless product :)"
2,They should redo this cover,"I really hate to say this...but the photo on the cover makes him look like a certain type of movie star. And Im not talking about disney. I know a lot of people over the years have been edified by Carman's music. I personally dont like it. But good grief, his album covers are painful."
4,very fun for live and campaign,"i loved this game, aiming is a little annoying and driving gets hard to get used to, thats the only things that are bad, live is fun and the game is fun"
2,Disappointed,I was very disappointed with this feeding set. I am sure it was designed for small hands to use but the spoon is to big for the doll and not realistic. The bib is cute but the other items could have been designed better.
2,Not too good,I purchased the Stella Doll and this feeding set for my 9 month old granddaughter. The doll is cute but the feeding set is not even really recognizable. I had to ask what each thing was i.e. a bowl or a can of peas. They were really soft made of fabric but not very stimulating looking or fun. She ignores them completely.
5,shocking,We are amazed how well this works. We have tried several other fly traps and the flies from our horse farm just love to die in this thing.
2,Off and on,"I've used the product a couple of years. There are many, many flies around here! Sometimes it works...sometimes it doesn't."
3,Not the Best Trance,"I love trance. As for ordering I got the DVD Quickly and it was in great shape. However the Trance DVD itself is a little weird. Ith has some old movie flashing all the time, and the music is old school trance with no anthems or vocals. Just old electronic stuff. I put it in the case and left it there"
4,Great cast of characters -,"Ms. Alderson creates a fabulous cast of characters in this fast-paced world of the Aussie socially elite. We've got a gay designer, an emotionally disturbed co-worker (quite a few of them actually), a dreamy cowboy, several others and at the heart of it all: Georgia, up-rooted British editor just trying to make it in this new crazy world into which she's transported herself.This novel has all the elements of a great summer read. I enjoyed it all in one sitting during a cross country flight. It's quick, it's witty (you will laugh out loud) and it's endearing. Don't miss it!"
2,"not terrible, no... but not that great, either","You know, I just don't think Mick Garris is much of a director. ""The Stand"" -- just not really very good. ""The Shining"" -- merely decent, and laughable when compared to either the Kubrick film OR the novel. ""Sleepwalkers"" -- great first half, pure garbage from that point on. ""Quicksilver Highway"" -- not even a good idea, much less a good final product.So when I say that this is the best Mick Garris movie I've seen, understand, that's not necessarily an endorsement.Sure, it's decent. But it's ONLY decent. Who is it for? People who are too lazy to turn the channel, and people -- like myself -- who buy every Stephen King movie. If you belong to the former category, you won't be spending your money anyways; if you're in the latter, you're gonna no matter what. If you're in neither, then you've no good reason to spend money on mediocrity like this."
4,Surprisingly good King adaptation,"This film is steeped in all things King, a bit of nostalgia with some black humor and gore thrown into the mix, heck there is even a talking bird. What Mick Garris achieves here is a nice mix of all the above without any of it being to heavy handed or dark. Garris's screenplay is much more effective than the King short and Jonathan Jackson's performance is impressive throughout. The tone shifts might be a little awkward for some but I found this to be a ride worth taking. Be warned of the dangers of hitchhiking on a 2 lane highway, nothing is what it appears especially those oncoming headlights. Good renter for most, and a worthy buy for King fanatics."
4,vintage stephen king,"i found this to be a very interesting movie, with a few underlying storylines, to spice up the plot. it's vintage king with spooky overtones, homages to death, questions about life and death, including the grim reaper toking a joint. is it shakespeare? no, it's king. (although he does reference shakespeare) and with king you can't ask for more than a good creepy story full of suspense and the supernatural. also the end was nostalgic and emotional; i really enjoyed this film and will probably include it in my dvd collection and like the films says whether or not we like it, sooner or later we will all have to ride the bullet"
3,Stephen King's Riding The Bullet......take the ride,"Jonathan Jackson (Insomnia '02, Tuck Everlasting) is going back to visit his sick mother at the hospital. While he is going back he meets some odd and strange people who he takes rides from...one of them being a crazy eyed David Arquette (The Scream Trilogy, Ravenous) who tells Jackson that he has a choice....he can die or his mother can die. Riding The Bullet is a short Stephen King story about a son and his dying mother and the ghosts and choices he has to face along the way there and he ends up riding the bullet which is a roller coaster he was afraid to go on as a little kid and also he flashes back about his mother. King said this was one of his deepest and closest stories to him since it was based upon his mother. Arquette is sinisterly funny as George and Jackson does a damn good job. Also starring Cliff Robertson (Spider-man, Escape From L.A.), Erika Christensen (Traffic, Swimfan) and Barbara Hershey (Beaches) as Jackson's mother."
2,The Bullet missed its target!,"I've never seen a horror movie with a plot like this before. It's absolutely original. The first half of the movie is engaging. Some frightening and suspenseful scenes happened while he's walking on the street at night. For example, the moment when he was chased into a car cemetery by two strangers.The second half is boring and repetitive. The worst thing is it turned out they all came from his own imagination!It's worth watching once."
3,Decent,"Most Stephen King fans will approve of this adaptation. There isn't much to be said about it really. I mean, RIDING THE BULLET, IMO, was one of my least fave King short stories to begin with, and this followed the story pretty much to the letter.The acting from the main charcters was ok, the dialouge was your average made-for-tv fare. There were a few chills, and overall was entertaining.Definitly see it if you're a KING fan. For movie fans in general, if there's nothing else you really want to see, then go ahead, just don't expect MISERY or DEAD ZONE."
5,So cute!,"My grandmother collects roosters, so I thought these would be a perfect addition to her collection. They're adorable and look really nicely crafted with the paint job. They came super speedy to my house and arrived in brand new condition! :)"
1,Great Neck Bit Brace = Chinese Jink,"This bit brace was total junk. The ratchet worked poorly when I got it. When I put a 5/8"" auger bit in it, the entire chuck blew up within 5 minutes (6"" deep into the pole I was drilling). 2 of the 4 jaw teeth came out, and the square bore at the base that the auger drill bit fits into to transfer torque was completely ruined and rounded out. Ended up finishing the job with a pair of solid Craftsman Vice Grips. This is cheap Chinese junk - I think the red handles are a sign of the maker. I would rate it ZERO stars, but you must have at least one. Don't bu y this - you will be disappointed."
3,"All hands, no heart","I can't give this a CD bad rating; these guys are good. I mean, really, really good.But I can't really give it a top rating, either. The entire CD is really a show-off session for their technical skills, at the expense of containing much really enjoyable guitar music.In fact, I almost wonder if the trio format forces them to do this. Maybe each of the 3 worried that they'd be singled out in reviews as the ""weak"" one of the group, who didn't show much technique next to the other guys.In any case, if you're a hard-core guitar-technique afficionado, you'll certainly be impressed. But if you're looking for some engaging guitar music you might pass on this one."
5,If stranded on a desert isle...I would want this CD with me!,"After nearly twenty years, this is still some of the most perfectly beautiful and emotionally intense music ever recorded,played by three of the world's finest guitarists."
2,Not terribly impressive,"I have recently read this book, and I have to say that I'm less than impressed with it. When I started it, I was pleased and relieved that it was so easy to read and entertaining, but after a couple of chapters of Eagleton's witticisms and biting humor, I found myself waiting for the ""theory"" to kick in...and it took him until the last three chapters. The book seems to be primarily a rant directed against capitalism (i.e.-the United States, though he does make a tiny disclaimer about this in the postscript), and while it's not surprising coming from an alleged Marxist, it does eventually begin to wear on the reader--at least on this reader. He has good points, but After Theory really feels more like a soapbox for a fist-shaking rant than a discussion of the decades that have comes after literary theory's ""golden age"" of 1965-1980. I was really hoping for more out of this book."
2,Dour Marxist Anti-American Screed,"Terry Eagleton is clearly bitter. Bitter about the status of America in the global community, bitter that his beloved Marxist dogma has been relegated to the rubbish bin of history. He does, however, have some perceptive things to say about the legacy of critical theory. What will replace theory as the new academic fad when theory finally vanishes from the intellectual horizon of the college English department? What will we read when Foucault, Derrida, Barthes and Althusser have been thoroughly debunked? Could it be...the source texts themselves?! Isn't that revolutionary?!! Someone might actually read...a novel! Or a poem! Oh, be still my beating heart!"
4,Kills scorpions,"I purchased Hi-Yield 38 (38% permethrin) at the same time I also purchased CY Kick CS. I put the hi-yield 38 on the outside of my cabin (after seeing 4 scorpions inside) and put the CY Kick CS inside. I went on vacation for a week. When I came back, there were 4 scorpions inside (all dead). It has been more than 2 weeks since I got home and I'm happy to report I haven't seen another scorpion. I hope they're gone forever. I plan on using both products every 60 days."
4,This is the House,"I love books that deal with history, and this book is chocked full of history. The down spots of this book is that in several spots it gets to involved with one subject and stays there too long. Thus causing me, the reader to become bored and lose interest. Overall the book was very good and kept me interested enough to read the second book ""This is the house of Kingsley Merrick""."
4,A great surprise,"I think that this is a really interesting compilation with an affordable price. Why interesting? Because you will find a handful of songs related to this extrange style called 'Dark Cabaret'; there is not a clear definition about it, but I am sure of your intuition...Think about Ute Lemper or Marlene Dietrich, but now-a-days. Does it sound weird? No, it sounds great! Trust me, try Jill Tracy (as gloomy as charming) or Dresden Dolls... it worths the 'effort'. Other songs, like 'Flowers', are simply classics; perhaps not exactly 'Dark Cabaret', but excellent stuff.What are you waiting for?"
2,Did not live up to the hype; not even close.,"I really was disappointed in this book. With all the hype I expected it to be filled with revolutionary ideas and recipes for totally green smoothies. There are a few interesting details such as the thought that our diet should more closely resemble chimps. Basically we should eat more greens. Other than that much of it is hard to believe. There is absolutely NO WAY all those people (first name only) were cured of illnesses by drinking one quart of green smoothies. Sorry... but NO WAY. Please, moles and warts just fell off.... That kind of claim is a total turn off. The recipes are plain old one cup of greens with fruit and ice. So basically eating one cup of spinach a day, ground up, will cure diabetes? Way over rated. I read it in one night and it is definitely not something I would want to keep as a reference for anything. Get it out of the library."
5,Life Changing Ideas,"Pros:* Easy and fascinating read* I now understand the power of greens.* Truly energising recipes - my teenage son is hooked!* I'm also hooked!Cons:* Since reading the book, my son and I have enjoyed smoothies every day. Unfortunately, although there are 7 pages of recipes, it's not enough! Hopefully, Victoria Boutenko will write a (larger) book just devoted to green smoothie recipes!"
1,Also Disappointed,"I agree 100% with Disappointed!I don't write many reviews but had to in this case.I would not call this a book, but more like a large pamphlet. It contains 166 pgs of which only 7 are the green smoothie recipes. Testimonials consist of 45 pgs., thats right 45, way overdone to provide verbage where the rest of the book is lacking.I didn't buy this book to get Testimonials and I wish I had read the reviews before paying so much for this book. What a huge waste of my hard earned money!!"
4,Interesting and useful,"Well enough written, a little to ""hyped"" for my taste (more or less you can ""cure cancer or any illness with green smoothies!"") However, much of the information in the book is well-sourced and accurate. First person accounts, though hyped, are very encouraging. A little dated, the book is still well worth reading and keeping around for reference."
1,Not good,"Paying more than 10 dollars for a pamphlet is too much for me and if its content isn't good or interesting even 2 dollars'd be too much. This is a booklet with few recipes and lot of theory, we aren't chimpazees, cooking some food, for example my favorite fruit: tomatoes, make, in this case, lycopene more bioavailable, so we absorb more of it, she backs up her theories with very bad science, as usual."
5,Very nice book,"I bought this book on recommendation and what I like most about it are two things:- author has spent a lot of time on research and has a lot of references at the end of the book to go and check yourself if you want to- she tried this on herselfBasically half a book is info about nutrition values of greens and the other half are testimonials and recipes.Haven't even read half of the book and I'm already making my own green smoothies (drinking one right now as I'm typing this), it's that easy to go and try it for yourself and see if it works for you.I recommend this book to anyone interested in improving their health and diet.P.S.You don't have to go and buy expensive blender immediately just to try this.I use 600W blender and I guess it will do until I see how green smoothies work for me."
3,Just can't choke it down,"I seriously thought she was just trying to sell a blender, I hate to admit I went through 5 blender in order to use the recipes in this book, they didn't break down but with out the horsepower you wont be able to get the food broken down to drink it.In the end thats what your doing, mixing it all together and drinking it, we tried is just gross, we just keep eating our salads and steamed brocolli and regular fruit smoothies."
2,Happy with product but not Bosh's customer service,I purchased these through a promotion with mail in rebate on amazon. I bought the exact product that was detailed on the Bosh rebate form & got a letter weeks later telling me that the product did not qualify. I am very disappointed in their failure to acknowledge their promotion and will not be buying these again.
3,meh,"No different then stock single lead spark plugs, this is all hype, no gas saving no performance increase, only positive thing to say is they are quality plugs by Bosch, but that's it, dont expect any miracles with these or any iridium plug!"
2,confused and uneven,"""Tales of Kilimanjaro"" appears on Zebop!, thus no need for this version. Guest musicians such as Nelson and Vaughan do not a great album make. Yes, it might have worked much later on 'Supernatural', but only because the material was cohesive and much better. Not the worst Santana album, but not a must have either."
3,Ok Santana Outing,"This is an ok Carlos Santana solo outing where he plays with a numerous amount of fellow musicians. The album is full of hits a misses, about 3/4s are misses, with a really cool song done with Willie Nelson."
1,Dr. Scholl's Women's Flat Out Slide,Sandal did not hold up. Had the sandals for 1 week. I caught my foot in the door and one sandal ripped. Who do you send them back to? The sandals are very comfortable but are not made to last.
4,Genuine and Inspiring,"Jason & deMarco are just so genuine and inspiring in their relationship with God, and eachother. This album has quickly become one of my favorites. Without question the stand out tracks are This Is Love, and Where the Sun Meets the Sea. Other strong tracks are Just In Time, and Missing You. The rest of the album is very strong vocally. ""Be The Light"" is uplifting and spiritual. The weakest track on the album is probably ""Stormy Weather"" with it's quirky ""you are my sunshine"" lyric. However if you are an Erasure fan you might actually like that one. All in all, the album exceeded my expectations."
4,Pepper fans will love this DVD,"Let me start out by saying that I love Pepper and have seen them live about four times now. They are just a really fun band to see on stage. This Live DVD, which was filmed over two nights at the Troubadour in Hollywood, does a great job of capturing Pepper's onstage energy and spirit. There are 18 songs on the DVD, running about 80 minutes. All the songs will be easily recognizable to Pepper fans, and both Kaleo and Bret's voices sound amazing. The DVD is also very well produced and edited, and the sound quality is excellent as well. The only downside to the show is that Kaleo and Bret seem to only be able to get the crowd going when they yell and curse at them. Other than that, the concert, the bonus features (music videos, a short documentary, etc) are great and anybody who loves Pepper will love this DVD."
3,Hmmm,"These are OK bars - just for show. They are body mounted and will not take a full-impact shot like a true frame mounted nerf bar would. A little spendy for what you get. They do look good, though."
5,Very timely,Very timely and item as discribed. Yes very timely and item as discribed. Satisfied my need. thanks a big big bunch.
4,"Great Graphics, Very Entertaining",Overall this game is very good in both the graphics field and the entertainment field. The only reason why I gave the game 4 stars instead of 5 was the fact that Anne Robinson had only about 3 or 4 punchlines. Other than that the game is great.Graphics: 94.5% (A)Entertainment Value: 89.3% (B+)Overall: 82.5% (B-)
2,I'm so disappointed!,"This game lacked substance. It played just like a mini version of the t.v. show, which sounds like a good idea, but the creators were completely unable to pull it off. Between levels, there are long dialogues between the characters which set up a plot line. After the dialogues, Buffy goes to patrol and, of course, is attacked by vampires. Unlike the t.v. show, Buffy only fights vampires. I was hoping for some vicious demons to shake things up, but no such luck. The game lacks choices. There are no weapons and you follow an arrow which points out the next vampire. The graphics and action are awful. Sometimes when fighting a vamp, you don't know if you are successfully hitting it or not. I would recommend this only if you are a hardcore Buffy fan."
3,Helped Me Pass,I do not have a science background and had a vague memory of Biology while studying for the CLEP using this book. I barely passed the test. Good enough. There is another earlier post that has a link to a community college in AZ and that link was very helpful.
4,Good coverage of material,"This guide provided a very good overview of the material for the exam. I used it, in conjunction withScience Terms Made Easy: A Lexicon of Scientific Words and Their Root Language Originsto master vocabulary, and fared very well on the exam.The sample exams give good practice, but I found the level of difficulty to be a bit lower than that of the actual exam.Overall, this is a worthwhile buy."
5,Great review for the Clep!,I was nervous about taking the clep. This book came in a week before the test. I had been studying a textbook and was running out of time! I started taking the tests in the book and reviewing the answers. I also read the book. All in less than a week! This helped me way more than the textbook and was very concise. I made well over the score required by the school. Without this book I know I wouldn't have done it! I do have somewhat of a background in biology but still needed to study! This book was a great review! There were charts on the test but mostly common sense. I definitely recommend this book!
3,Good Summary of previous knowlage,"this book is quite consise and through, but it is very brief, and does not cover the information with enought depth to serve as a stand alone text. coupled with a college textbook (recommended anyway), the summary and practice tests should serve as a good preparation for the CLEP."
1,picture makes it look great,"Don't go by the picture. There is a chip of a diamond in the center stone and where it looks like diamonds on the side, its just silver. I wasn't looking for real diamonds in a $40.00 ring, but some sort of stone would be nice."
3,"Good workout, but the instructor is annoying","I have to agree with one of the previous reviewers that the instructor of this video is annoying. Her New York accent and attitude just did not sit well with this Midwesterner. I would say that the workout was very good, I definitely could feel it in my abs as I was doing it, even though I was gritting my teeth at the annoying banter between instructor and sidekicks. Also, the quality of the video was nowhere near that of other fitness videos such as the The Firm's or Denise Austin. Spend your money elsewhere, wish I would have rented it first."
4,a decent abs workout,I was a little disappointed that a lot of the video also focuses on glutes. I really wanted 30 minutes of abs workout.
1,What in the world was Groom thinking?,"After the success of the movie ""Forrest Gump,"" you would think thatGroom would make Gump a kind, gentle idiot. Instead, I found myself hating Gump and Groom throughout this book. An extremely disappointing book."
2,Are we allowed to say bull crap? That's all this is.,"Yeah, I finished it. If I could be very blunt with just two words, it sucks! I'm wondering what happened! Forrest Gump was brilliant. This was flat out retardo talk the whole way through. The ghost of Jenny, OOOHH! Real original, Groom. Lt. Dan, reunited? That was actually ok.If there was 1 thing I could actually pin point and agree with 100%, it would have to be a kid's reaction to his new creation, New Coke when he said, ""EEWW!! This tastes like [...]"" Yeah, and it read like it, too! 100 pounds of pure waste of it, along with a real waste of talent. I ain't readin' no more of Winston Groom! If you wanted a best selling sequel, write something that actually sells. Not over 350 pages of pure BS! I at least hope his effort was worth it. What a waste of time. What a shame!"
2,one of the most tiring books I've ever read!,"I am sure that after the great performance by Tom Hanks portraying Forrest Gump, everyone is dying to hear of a sequel to the movie. Gump & Co. brings that to the readers except Forrest's life does not match up to the life of Forrest from the movie. Forrest isn't having the best time of his life and he needs to survive all the hardships being thrown to him. Reading the book is suppose to give you the sense of reading the continuation of his life. The past references that Forrest makes in the book are not equivalent to the movie itself. In the movie for example, his long time sweetheart Jenny was buried under ""their tree"" in Forrest's backyard. In the book, I really wanted to put the book down. Some parts just didn't make sense. The movie and the novel were two entirely different things. I highly do not recommend this book if you are interested in reading a sequel to Forrest Gump. Just wait for the actual movie sequel."
1,Don't read this book!,This book (and impending movie) was the worst ideas in the history of bad ideas. It simply isn't needed. Something was captured with Gump I and it will never be re-captured. Forrest Gump was on of the most original and great stories of all time and should have been left at that. Greed made this second story and will probably make a third and fourth etc.. To me this book does not exist. It is a bastardization of Forrest Gump.
2,2 never worked properly,"I went through two before I gave up, the first one never worked proeprly. It transferred very slowly at first and then not at all. I RMA'd the first one and the one that replaced it worked for two uses before dying. I've since picked up a $8 usb reader that is much slower but much more reliable. I've done lots of video editing with the firewire card so I don't know what kept killing the drives. It'll take some real convincing to get me to buy another lexar product. I hate being negative, but this experience really soured me. It sounds like many have had better success than I, but be ware."
5,Great live album!!,"WOW!! What a spectacular album!! I'm a long time Tull fan and this cd shows them on a great night. The sound is perfect, very crisp and clear.This cd has mind blowing solos from all members.Ian's voice sounds very powerful here. Martin's guitar work is amazing. If you like Tull you'll love this cd. AMAZING!!"
4,A Documentary,Jethro Tull at the Isle of Wight is more of a documentary than a live performance. They do play 6 songs from their early years.Tull also does a very early version of My God which later appeared on Aqualung.Ian Anderson is interviewed and talks about everything from how he learned flute because he knew he could never play like Eric Clapton.He also talks about how promoters used Tull to get fans to pay for the performance.This is very early Tull but a must for Tull fans like myself..
4,Mp3 player,"For a low-cost player, I think this is a pretty good deal, you shouldn't pay more than $10-12.00. The manual leaves a little to be desired, so when I tried to set it up I did something wrong, but there was no troubleshooting section. The manufacturer's website includes an area to email for support, which I did. The email section was apparently not working, so a few days later I called. Someone answered right away, and they were very apologetic that they had not received my inquiry. Within a couple hours of explaining my problem, I got an email with everything my low-tech brain needed to solve my problem. I will do business with this company again."
4,"Great ""short"" shorts for hot yoga","I bought these shorts because I hated how the normal shorts I would wear soaked up too much sweat and would either be too heavy, or stick to my thighs. Neither situation was comfortable. These shorts were snug (though not overly snug) and offered good support without showing off too much of the ""boys"". Since they start of close to your skin, it's not quite noticeable that they are ""sticking"". They cling a little, but due to the material, it is still relatively unobtrusive when moving from pose to pose. I have a 31"" waist, and 145lbs, 5'8"" -- the medium size was like I was swimming in them. I had to return them for a small. Once that swap was made, everything was good. I took 1-star off for the thigh area not being tight enough. Though there was no risk of ""showing"" something; I'd still have rather had a pair of shorts that hugged me throughout."
4,Snug yoga shorts,"I purchased a medium because larges are now too large for me. The mediums are snug so these aren't for guys with bellies. I like them though, they can be worn with or without underwear. Only had them for a month so I don't know how they will hold up over time. I do hang dry them so I expect they'll be durable."
2,Unsuitable for younger children!,"Although Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing is marked as being suitable for children 8 and up, I can not recommend it for elementary and middle schoolers. The child is required to have a typing speed goal of 25 WPM, and 25WPM must be achieved with each lesson before the child is allowed to progress to a higher level. My 9-year-old is stuck typing ""asdf"" and ""jkl;"" until he is crying tears of boredom. After 50 minutes of practice, he had brought his speed up from 6WPM to 10WPM, so that 25WPM goal still seemed a long way away.I would prefer to see a younger child able to type homework mistake free at 15WPM, than have one who refuses to learn to type because he can't take being forced to practice ""asdf"" for endless hours."
2,Makes me wonder about the rest of Lexar's products,"This SmartMedia reader worked fine a couple times. Then, after sitting unused for a month or so, did not work at all. Clearly, Lexar has no faith in the product, since they've discontinued it and offer no technical support for it. After this experience, I would be very reluctant to buy any other Lexar product."
1,WARNING: This is not a legitimate product,"My name is Bill Holland, and I'm the artist and the sound recording copyright owner of this album, Players, Fools and Thieves. I have never licensed this album to Brighton Beach Records, which, at least on this amazon site, lists itself as the record company/label. Any other facts withstanding, consider this a pirated disc. You can purchase the album through me legitimately at [...]."
4,A beautiful gift to pass down to your child.,"This is a beautiful book filled with questions to answer about yourself, your spouse and your child as she grows up and gets married.It has lovely pictures and sentimental writings. This is a wonderful gift for a new mother and her child and will be treasured forever."
4,Awesome game,This game is really fun. You can count on this game to keep your intrest. I loved it and I have so many games already that it is almost inpossible to keep track. This was the one game out of all of mine that I got the most use out of. There are a lot of levels and new lands. You can choose between 2 characters [lille frog or frogger]. There are 6 or more stages. Ice Age Gators lair and many many more... If youre interested in this game I say go for it! You'll be happy with your purchase!
5,Frogger 2 Rocks!,"I love Frogger 2 because its so much fun and you never know what the next level is going to bring you. It also helps your hand-eye coordination, so parents who are skeptical, don't be, it teaches something!"
5,Safety Chain,"This safety chain arrived on time and is made of some good metal, now I can feel better when towing my trailer."
3,could be much better - size is off,"It's soft and warm but the portion that covers the forehead is way too narrow so you leave third the forehead uncovered, I am a guy who wear l-Xl helmet and this headband is big for me. I had it fixed by a tailor"
4,"Surprise, a ""G"" rated comic","This is a well written comic with flat, but appealing artwork. However, be aware that this comic plays to the younger set (as more comics should). So if you are into Transmetropolian or Sandman, don't expect this book to stimulate your jaded senses.The stories have a magical, adventure quality, much like the C.S. Lewis ""Narnia"" series. Your grade-school child can do far worse than to read this book, and you may find yourself liking it too..."
1,NOT FOR 97-01 JEEP CHEROKEE,"It might work, but not for a 97-01 Cherokee. the parts finder on amazon told me that it will fit. never depend on amazon parts finder, it has been right the first 10 times i ordered parts, but not this time. bando labels there belts with the last 4 numbers as the belts length in mm. this one is 6pk2310, so that is 2310 mm. (90.9449"")"
3,Cuisinart Stockpot,The Stockpot came quickly and without damage. It is a quality piece which will be enjoyed for years to come. My one reservation was that the brushed finish on the item had irregularity in the brushing. This was a Christmas present and the recipient did not think the irregularity was enough to warrant returning it.
5,Great Pot,I have tried this pot for some time now and really like it. It cooks evenly and holds the heat a long time. Being dishwasher safe make clean up easy. This was an addition to a set I had bought.
4,good product,"This line of cuisinart is very good. Not bad comparing to All-Clad stainless steel line. At much cheaper price, this is a bargain. The lid handle is a little bit cheap design. The rest is excellent. I like it."
3,Not for me,"Very heavy and well built but...It's supposed to be flat bottomed for use on a ceramic top electric stove. They advertise it for use with this type of stove.The bottom is certainly not flat - not the kind of flatness my stove needs. The pan is concave on the bottom and causes my heating element to overheat and cycle on and off (which is does for safety). This cycling slows down the heating of the pot's contents.I bought this pot specifically to rapidly bring water to a boil. With any other pot contents, you wouldn't use the stoves highest heat so there wouldn't be any heating element cycling.If you have other than a ceramic top electric stove, then go for it. It'll be great for you. But not for me :-("
2,Buy it for $25 less! At cutleryandmore.com,Price kept changing at amazon and I found it for $25 less at ths site with free shipping! http://www.cutleryandmore.com/cuisinart-multiclad-pro/stainless-steel-stock-pot-p111045Amazon won't match the price or lower what I paid after they lowered their prices 2 days after I placed my order. Even good department stores have a 14 day window where they credit you if they lower the price.
3,an ok movie,If you are board and nothing else on TV this is a movie for you. It was kind of lame but had a good story line.I didn't like the ending but over all it was worth the watch.
2,Doom,"First of all I won't tell you about the game, because we all know it's the best, I'll tell you about what comes in the package. Nothing, save the cd. No printed manual, no artwork, no key guide, I THOUGHT THIS WAS A COLLECTOR'S EDITION!... And if you plan on playing this with a mouse you'd better think again because doom95 (the windows 95 launcher) doesn't support usb mouses and practically all new computers come with usb mouses. However the great free program jdoom (jdoom.newdoom.com)adds mouse support, improved graphics, quake style console, and even updated polygonal graphics! The horrible part about this is that the average customer won't even think to download jdoom... The games themselves are great but the company didn't put any effort into this. This is in no way a ""collector's edition"" it's just repackaged old software."
4,thy flesh consumed,"i played doom as a young kid when it first came out (i'm 20 now, so do the math) with my dad. i thought it was wild, but then it sorta got lost in the shuffle.. new computer, all that stuff..so i bought the collectors edition.now i remember what all the commotion was about.let me just say this. even if youve played doom before, go ahead and hop into Doom 1, and play Thy Flesh Consumed on Ultraviolence. scared the bejeezus outta me. those first two levels. absolutely diabolical. not to say that the rest of that mission isnt equally as challenging, but those first two made my jaw hit the floor.oh and a word of advice to those who decide to get jDoom or something up that vein. Dont reprogram the controls to use the mouse. Using todays control structure, i BLEW thru doom on the hardest difficulty with almost no issues at all. you need to be on keyboard ONLY."
3,Amazon Product Description is Wrong.,"If you have read the Amazon Production Description above, let me tell you that it is completely wrong. You do not encounter the Black Night Ghost or any of the others. It's ""The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" case that Scooby and the Gang are working on.And I agree with the other reviewers. If you can not read, this is not a very good game. Basic reading ability is required to fully enjoy this game. Also, this game does not work with the Nintendo D.S. system, which made my daughter very dissapointed. So, we had to go out and buy her a Nintendo S.P., which made her happy again.So, if you like Scooby Doo and are under the age of twelve, this is a very good game for you to have!"
2,Low mechanical quality and hard to assembly,"I received the product, it looks good in the box.Two main problem:1. Assembly of rail is almost impossibleThe connector piece cannot be easily inserted to the long rail piece due to mechanical design, and also production quality. I almost come to the point of not knowing what to do. The connector is half way to the rail and stuck. Cannot go further in or out. I thought of return it, however I cannot put it back into the box due to the problem. After a long time struggle, I managed to push it in. However the screw holes are not aligned so that I cannot add any screws to the connectors (both top and bottom pieces).2. It is very hard to assemble the rail frame, unless you are a really good handy man3. The user manual has poor quality. Worst is that the Figure 9 gave wrong indication of how the brackets should be used. I wasted quite some time and eventually figured it out from their online manual, which is in color and correct."
5,Another Great Mystery!,"Sharon Fiffer has created a terrific mystery. I've read each of the Jane Wheel books - this is the best yet. Absorbing plot. Excellent use of language and description. Artfully developed characters - they're all quite believable, yet each is quirky in some entertaining way. We've all known a ""Nellie"" - someone we're in love with one moment and would like to strangle the next. Then there is the unflappable Detective Oh, and his elegant wife, Claire. And Jane's family relationships (with husband Charley, and son Nick) are portrayed in considerable depth and with just the right amount of humor. The story moves quickly along, and the mystery keeps the reader guessing until the end. Mystery lovers should not miss this book. I believe there will be more Jane Wheel editions in our future - and I am thankful for that!"
2,A lot better is available,This book is just OK. There are a lot better out there for the money. I particularly like Designing Web Usability by Jakob Nielsen.If you want an overall web design for beginners than Lyndas book designing web graphics 3 is excellantWeb design WOW provides information and lots of inspirationHope these suggestions help you
2,Probably out of date.,"This attractive book gives good basic guidance for designing sites that draw the user's eye to important elements. However, the state of this art has advanced since 1997, when the book was published. Much of what the book recommends seems to have become conventional wisdom today (2002). Buy this book if you're a novice; otherwise, just move along."
4,Good resource,"This is a great introduction to tapestry crochet, which is not difficult to master, and very intuitive, actually. Give it a go! It has a decent array of projects, though some are a little dated, which is why I give 4 stars vs. 5. I also think the cost is a tad bit high, but all in all this is probably the best resource for this technique."
4,Eating without Heating,Great book. Great ideas. Have just begun to attempt these new raw recipes but loving them so far. Tons of energy too. Love the teens and their great attitudes towards life. Highly recommend for someone interested in raw food.
5,Great little memory stick reader,Love it!!!. Fits nice into my laptop case. Not USB 2.0 but not a problem for me. Great little compact memory card reader.
5,Best deal for the best way.,"I purchased mine after somehow losing the propriatary sony camera>usb cable. I decided that I didn't want to purchase another cable, as the terrible battery life sucks more juice from the batteries while having to have the camera on when transferring photos.I'd have to say this is the absolute best '3rd party' product I've ever purchased- this reader [and writer] is wonderful. It seems to actually be faster than the camera itself. In XP it is automatically recognized and works perfectly. The item looks kind of [inexpensive] with the translucent plastic- but it's actually very sturdy. I have lots of faith in this little guy!If you want a memory stick reader, this is definaly the one to put your money into. It's a great price for such a nice product."
2,Poor video quality,"I purchased this video to keep me entertained while deployed overseas. I action and information was OK, but the video quality was poor. I watched it once and then gave it away to another soldier."
4,Quite nice,"Nice lamp- not sure what else to write other than it looks good. Not a reading light! It gives off a nice warm glow in our bedroom. I would suggest that you, like we, buy another similar lamp for the other side of the bed so it's not too matching in your decor...I'm getting good at this decor stuff- for a guy anyway (i think that's probably sexist)Anyway, enjoy!"
5,What I've been looking for!!,"This yoga DVD was exactly what I've been looking for. Having just begun doing yoga about 6 weeks ago, I wanted to have a video that I could use in between my classes. Being cautious about just buying any DVD, I decided to try this one. And I'm glad that I did. Natasha was wonderful. I did the instruction segment first then moved into the practice segment. The practice segment is perfect for an early morning routine. I found her to be easy to understand and follow and she was not boring nor slow. I'm definitely looking forward to trying the other 2 DVDs in this series."
5,Years of Fun!,"We purchased this for my daughter when she was 2 1/2 years old. She continues playing it with almost daily at 4 years old. It's amazing and a great value.The dolls are a little odd, but other brands (like Loving Family) fit just fine in the furniture. And my daughter (and her friends that flock to this house) don't seem to mind the cloth dolls.I was initially concerned about the durability of this house, but it has endured many many hours of play from different kids--boys and girls. It's a hit with both. We've had such a good time with this and hours and hours of fun. It's definitely been one of the best toy purchases we've made--well worth the money!!"
1,poor quality!!!!!,"I bought this dollhouse for my daughter's 3rd birthday. Within the first week I had to glue at least 3 pieces of furniture back together. Over the past year I've repaired numerous pieces and the house cannot be moved without the back and roof coming off. (It is now taped together). For $150 and with all of it's ""awards"" I expected much better quality. I think ALEX needs to stop selling this house and redesign it."
2,not worth the money,I bought this for my daughter. She hardly ever played with it. The furniture fell apart without much use. The dolls were not fun (they didn't do anything & were ugly) & most other dolls will not fit in the house! My daughter now wants a new doll house that is more fun.
4,sherlock holmes,"Nice Movie Package. The movies with Basil Rathbone portraying Sherlock Holmes are my preference. The others playing the Role are not nearly as good, although the movies were okay."
3,Kristi Bernard@CLCD,"The writings of Laura Ingalls Wilder have sparked the interest of readers who are eager to learn about life on the prairie during the 1800s for a long time now. This newest addition offers readers new entries as well as her travels and adventures. The extras in the back of the book include Laura's Family Tree, Letters to Laura and Laura's Final Letter to Rose. If readers are introduced to Laura for the first time this collection is an excellent way to learn about this remarkable young girl and her life's journey. Pictures and photos of actual letters will keep readers turning pages to reveal history in the making. It will answer all questions about what it must have been like to group up in the late 1800s to the mid 1900s. This is not a book for young readers alone, adults will enjoy this page turner as well. This is a good time for families to sit down and discuss their own history and enlighten young readers"
2,Not what I was looking for.,I was very disapointed in this book. I was under the impression that it would not only be instructive but that all of the work in it would be Gerald Brommer's. It was neither.
4,Collage Techniques: A Guide for Artists and Illustrators,The book is a complete treatise on the subject. Many redundacies however. I would have preferred more hands on demonstrations from the author.
3,Nice Little Disc,"As long as you know what you're getting, you'll get a pleasant disc. We get the entire hour-long ""You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown"" TV special from 1987. It was a nice adaptation, but the kid's singing voices get annoying. It would have been a great chance to get ""Snoopy: The Musical"" on here, but we get the same amount of content as all discs. The bonus feature documentary was enjoyable also."
4,"You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown:A Peanut Musical","For adults, it is a fun musical. I don't recommend it for kids, it is kind of boring,my 10 year old son did not like it."
5,You Really Are a Good Man Charlie Brown!,"It's a great movie for kids, especially those with low self-image. I was in the musical at school(Peppermint Patty), and the movie was just as fun. It's a must see for all ages! The music is great and a lot of kids can relate. It's so funny too!"
4,"Solid album, a precursor of things to come","This was Survivor's last album with David Bickler at the mic. Jimi Jamison would take over a year later to do Vital Signs. I almost wished Jamison had been recruited for ""Caught in the Game"". The song formula is catchy and polished and Jamison's melodic voice would have fit perfectly on these batch of songs. Still, Bickler does an admirable job and the album cruises with confidence. Had Jamison sang, I think ""Caught in the Game"" would have sold a LOT more copies instead of being anunderrated gem. My humble opinion. Release your mind and get caught in the game!"
3,Christmas Village Display,"At casual glance, the snowy landscape is rather attractive. The fabric worked OK for a backgound to my Christmas village because I arranged items to cover printing imperfections. However, the plastic fabric is flimsy and won't withstand much re-use. Fortunately, I didn't need much and have plenty left over for next year. I expect to use another screen to make the background more multi-dimensional and hide the imperfections in the material."
3,Good for a rental or two.......,"This game's really not that bad. The Rumble and Single player modes are okay but there are no storylines. This game's similar to the Smackdown! series, but there are better graphics and more signature moves. There are also newcomers (at the time) like Kurt Angle, Tazz, and Rikishi. If you want something to do on a weekend, give this game a try. Or, if you can find this game for a reasonable price ...buy it. The thing that kills this game, though, is lack of depth. No Create-A-Wrestler feature or gimmick matches (although, there is a cage area). Besides that, this game's pretty good."
2,Royal rumble,This is the worst game I have ever played. you cant use the anlogthay cant do combos and you cant get out of the ring and thayonly have two modes.
2,THQ's worst wrestling game yet.,"In this game you cant create you own player, all you can do is exibition and a royal rumble. I expected a better game from THQ because of their game WWF Smack Down which is one of the best wrestling game ever. If you just like to use about 14 or 15 characters where you cant customize the moves to be easier, and where you cant create your own character than you might like this game, but if you like games that are fun and dont get boring for a while than this is definately not for you. You can look into smackdown for PS and smackdown 2 or PS and probably PS2 and they might even make that for dreamcast."
1,This Game Is Awful,I expected much more from THQ's first wrestling game for Dreamcast after seeing their other wrestling games on other consoles. The only good thing about this game is watching nine wrestlers in the ring at the same time. There are only a little over twenty characters which is a disappointment to all wrestling fans. There are no wrestler introductions. The moves are very limited and boring. The replay value is virtually zero. This game will keep your attention for one day before it becomes absolutely boring. There are minimal game play modes. I urge you to rent this game first before you waste money on it. My copy of this game would be a coaster right now if I hadn't sold it before people knew how bad it was. THQ and WWF should be ashamed of themselves.
3,Smackdown it ain't......a wrestling version of NFL Blitz.,"Boy, did I have high hopes going into this game. After playing Smackdown on the PSX, I thought Royal Rumble was gonna be the DC's answer.......and I was wrong. It's a direct port of the arcade game, and yes, 9 wrestlers can be on the screen at one time, but the game itself can get quite repetitive after a while. There's no real tag-team mode; it's system is similar to that of Marvel vs Capcom, where you have someone helping you out a couple of times during a match. No create-a-wrestler, no storylines, no belts......no nothing. Just the Royal Rumble. Just an exercise in button-mashing....the kind of game you have to play with someone else just to get some sort of enjoyment out of it.My advice....DON'T BUY THIS GAME. It's good enough for a rent, but its replay value does not warrant paying a bundle of money for it. Play it in the arcades.....it's the same game, only much cheaper."
2,This Game [stinks]!,The only reason i gave it 2 stars are because of the graphics. THEY ARE AMAZING! Even though the graphics are amazing dont buy it because there are only 2 modes to play in- Exhibition and royal Rumble! That [Stinks]! You are A Billion Times Better Off Buying No Mercy and/or Smackdown 2
4,"Not Smackdown, but pretty good","I think this game is good and bad. Good because it has 9 wrestlers in the ring at once action. The graphics ROCK!and you can beat up the refere. Also, you can have a partner be at ring side with you and come in and do his special move or throw you a weapon and do double team moves.This game is BAD because there are only 21 wrestlers. There are no special matches like ladder matches or even hardcore matches,but there are 80 hardcore weapons! So I give the game a four because the game is still pretty fun but a little disapointing ."
1,Worst Game Ever,I played it for 10 minutes than ran over it with my car. Too few modes everything was horrible. Bottom Line don't waste your money .
2,Cool but boring,"This game is sooooo boring. The graphics are pretty good But no face movement. They just have heads that baerly move. There are no entance themes. Only when you win it plays the music for 10 seconds. There are not alot of moves. You will find your self doing the same move about 15 times in one match. There's no tag team. You pick and a partner,and all your partner does is interfere or throw an item to you. This is one of the only games that every match has a ref. O yeah there are only 2 modes exibition which you have to fight 10 wrestlers than win. The other mode is royal rumble. You just try to knock the other guyes out of the ring. This is the worst WWF game ever!!"
2,What kind of game is this?,I got this game from BlockBuster (I did not buy it) I was thinging o cool this is cool I got home played it.... THIS GAME WAS SO SO bad well not that bad but WM2000 and no mecry is 100% better then this. Its ture its ture.Thats all.
1,Diappointed,"Even though I used the sizing chart provided, this item was not the right size. It is therefore now useless to my son."
3,NO GARDEN STATE,"While this is good......make no mistake...it is no ""Garden State"". It certainly shouldn't be dubbed as ""Garden State 2""."
2,Jackson is at his best but this movie isnt that glorious,"Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill Vol.2, XXX 2: State Of The Union) plays Coach Ken Carter who becomes the new coach for a High School in which he went to when he was in school. Richmond is the name of the school and The Richmond Oilers is the name of the team he coaches. Jackson has them sign contracts in order to be a part of the team. In that contract is stuff like...he has to be on time for class, sit in front of the class, wear a tie and suit on game day and maintain a C average grad point to graduate. Not the most inspiring movie in my mind but it had its moments...I mean, you guys might find this uplifting and WOW!! but I found it to be longish and boring really and it sorta played off like a cheesy TV movie like on the Lifetime. Only Jackson gives off his usual blazing brilliance. Also starring Rob Brown and singer Ashanti who isnt impressive..mostly annoying."
4,Coach Carter,"This movie was very interesting Coach Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) demonstrated what it is like or can be like trying to save teens from getting involved in street life. The alternative was to utilize their time in a more positive and constructive way, such as attending college. The younger actor's who portrayed the school basketball team were very talented, as well. Of course it had drama, light violence, all the ingredients that seem to sale movies these days. It was well worth watching. I did not feel that I waisted my time watching it."
1,Disappointed!,"The ONLY person who was able to act in this movie was S.Jackson. The rest of the people, where did they find them? And Ashanti, someone needs to tell her she couldn't sing and she definately CANNOT act!!!"
1,A disappointment,This book is a miserable read. It is a very poor reflection of who she once was. The stories that I have heard of her are not a reflection of this book. Maybe her next one will be better.
5,Killer Submissions,This book is one of the best MMA training guides that i have ever seen.It takes a logical chain approach to submission similar to a boxing combination.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in submission wrestling regardless of skill level.The detailed analisis of each movement was impressive and the corresponding pictures made it easy to learn.
5,Great Looking Dispenser,I ordered this soap dispenser to replaced another York dispenser that broke. The spring in the nozzle somehow flipped sideways. So far this one has been a great replacement with no spring troubles and looks fabulous.
2,Planned Obsolescence?,"Man, I was a huge hit with the missus to find a large kitchen soap dispenser that matched the decor. I even gloated a bit myself. That was, until 90 days in the nozzle came off, rendering it inoperable.I threw the dice and ordered another, hoping it was a fluke instead of a design flaw. Just about 90 days into dispenser #2, same deal.Now, only adults us this thing and we're not exactly stress testing this thing by any means, so it's a real head-scratcher for me. Heck, it takes so long to empty it, we hardly handle more than the pump. The rest of the reviews - reviews which bolstered my confidence in the initial purchase - seem mostly glowing.So it goes. Searching for a different model for #3."
4,Very Enjoyable Read,This was a very good read. It did not seem like your typical romance book. It took the characters until the end of the book before they finaly came together. I would reccommend this book to anyone who is looking for something other than your typical romance book.
1,Drags on,"I have read other books by Jillian Hart. However, in this book she spends way to much time writing about what the characters are feeling and thinking and very little time on the plot and action of the story. I would not recommend this book, it was a waste of my money."
3,Different but pretty good,"I always liked this era of Cheap Trick(One on One, Next Position Please) before they went straight to hell with ""Standing On The Edge"" and ""The Doctor."" Some songs are pretty terrible but overall a good effort. I love ""3-D""!!!! Because it's 3-D! The more you look! The more you see!"
3,Not Bad,"The Todd Rundgren produced Next Posistion Please remains underrated. Songs like ""Invaders of the heart"",""I can't take it"", and ""In 3-D"" are some their best songs of the 80's. The sound quality is a problem. Nothing a good remastering with bonus tracks can't take care of. Hopefully they will re-release more than the first 3 albums."
3,Weird...,"I denifintely loved the lack of keyboards here. RUSH needed a change, and they scored it alright removing the keyboards and going for a in-your-face sound.Lee's bass playing here is something absurdly marvellous, an expert showing what he's capable of. Peart's drumming is more restricted here, more focused.But tha fact is that solme of the songs are really hard to hear, even after three hundred listens!I think this album is better than their last ones, but ít not deserves five stars. But RUSH fans will always give them five stars. I'm a RUSH fan, but at least I can try to see thing coldly."
2,Too darn loud,"I love Rush sound and its evolution throughout the years. I own almost all of the CDs plus some vinils.This could be a very good CD, as the songs are good. Nevertheless, Vapor Trails is *not* a good CD.This CD is recorded so loud that does *not* sound right. The sound is so distorted that you cannot tell if the lead guitar is Alex Lifeson or your punk neighbor down the street, using a Spinal Tap-type amplifier cranked all the way to ""eleven"".It's is a real shame that a band this good, with such virtuoso musicians, get their work all destroyed because a dont-know-better sound engineer decided to crank the amplifier to ""eleven"".When I listen to Rush I want to listen to good musicians playing. If I want it loud, I have my volume control, thank you very much.I'm disturbed by this trend of cranking the volume so high that musical skill doesn't matter anymore.:("
3,Rush meets grunge,"Strange for Rush to follow the grunge craze so late.Compared to most Rush CDs, this one is characterized by a much less melodical approach (even the singles), a heavy guitar sound but no solos to speak of.I can't really say their technical abilities stand out in this one as much as in the past. This CD seems to share many weka points of 90's music (poor sound quality, few technical numbers).I was expecting more from the guys. Maybe next time eh?"
4,great songs mastered crappy!5 stars if mastered properly.,I really think the songs on this album are fantastic!but ruined by no dynamic range!but i think putting the songs through my tube amp with my 24 bit hrt music streamer with jriver music will make it sound much better.but i will remaster it myself unless rush remaster the whole album.is there a better vapor trails import that sounds better?anyone know?
2,When you thought you'd heard it all from Rush.......,"When you thought you'd heard Rush go into all the musical directions possible, they find a new one. ...the songs on this cd cannot be distinguished apart(sound wise). ""Vapor Trails"" has a real heavy grunge feel throughout with lots of guitar distortion. Much of the time Geddy can barely be heard over the music. The production quality and clarity seems poor to me. It's not a bad sound for the grunge scene but if you are a Rush fan of (2112,Farewell,Grace,Fly,Moving Pics, etc), you'll be disappointed. I have to say I think ""Test for Echo"" was a better cd if that's any help for some of you deciding whether or not to buy this one. I have to say that I gave another couple of listens after the initial and some of the music is growing on me a bit. It's very different and that has fans wondering about the direction that Rush has taken in 2002. Give it another listen once the shock has worn off because there are a few very good tunes mixed in there."
2,Glimmer of Hope,"Vapor Trails holds a glimmer of hope for fans of Rush, however, while it tries to rock a bit harder than recent albums, it lacks overall musical inspiration and melodic structure. Vocal lines are largely directionless and void of emotion, and even some of the guitar riffs are reused on this album from A.L.'s Victor project as well as previous Rush albums. Nothing really new to grab onto from this album except for a few cool production tricks. I am very happy to see the band back together again after such a long break, but I really don't feel rewarded for waiting so long."
4,Great ball of Fire!,"I own and have heard every Rush recording. this one ranks with the best of them. I could be a little clearer though, but all great progressive music needs to be finely produced. I like earthshine the best so far."
2,Disappointing,"I have been a Rush fan for more than 20 years and have been through the various transitions in style. Yet, no matter how many times I listen to Vapor Trails, I can't seem to find any direction with this CD. Certain tracks seem disjointed at times while others pound constantly with drums. With all the hype this CD was given, I expected a style similiar to that of 2112. This album was a real disappointment considering it's coming from a band that's been around for more than 30 years."
1,Vapid Trail,"I bought this new Rush CD shortly after it was released. I listened to it. I cried. I then went out to my backyard, dug a hole, and buried it."
4,Not for the casual listener,"This album takes some serious effort to appreciate. At first listen, the density and mixing make it hard to digest. This will be a radio bust, for sure. It takes some e.q. fiddling for it to not sound muddy (cut the bass, yes, you read that right) and about 20 listens before the brilliance becomes apparent. If you need some reassurance go directly to 'How it is' which is the most approachable song. On the bright side, this album just gets better and better. Don't be deterred."
1,The Truth about the Mastering,"Yes, this CD is mastered so poorly it's unlistenable after a couple songs due to distortion and lack of dynamics(which is the reason for my rating). However, this is neither the band's nor the mastering engineer's fault. Record labels demand that their CDs are louder than all others; they have absolutely no regard for how this affects the music. They simply do not care. So, if you're going to complain, please complain to the record label responsible for releasing this. To find out more about the ""loudness race,"" visit http://www.loudnessrace.net. Also, contrary to the misinformed belief of one reviewer, turning down the volume will not make things better; you're simply turning down distorted and overcompressed music."
1,the worst rush album!,"its easily their worst. its got all the bad qualities - muddy guitar sound which seems like some sessions guitarists is playing, awful vocals by geddy, and really annoying noises all throughout the songs. i can't believe this is the same band that produced albums like ""grace under pressure"", ""power windows"", ""hemispheres"" etc. fans of classic rush, keep away from this piece of garbage."
4,Definitely worth the wait!,"The first few times I listened to this album I had a hard time getting into it. I think I was still in Test For Echo mode. Once I got used to the sound of Rush rocking out like in the old days I started to love this album. Granted, there are three or four songs I'm not crazy about but even those are bearable. I mean for god sakes, it's not nearly as bad as Presto! The good songs however, such as Ghost Rider, Vapor Trails and Sweet Miracle are REALLY good. While I would have loved to hear more twenty minute drum solos and such, these guys are in their fifties! Cut 'em some slack. Overall, a good album that should (unlike their last few albums) should sound even better live."
1,Noise,"I'm a huge Rush fan. However, who knows if I like this album. It's mastered so badly that I can't listen to the whole disc. It's dynamically-compressed and clipped; every song sounds like noise to me.My recommendation is to wait until Rush masters this disc properly before purchasing."
3,NO LIFESON SOLOES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I am trying to get into the new Rush cd but there are no guitar soloes on the cd!!!!!!!!!!!! That is killing this guitarist!! I think some of the tunes sound pretty cool though so will update after I play it 10 times this week!Update: I have listened several times and I like the cd but certainly do not love it! The recording especially as noted all over is horrendous! I want 2112 meets Permanet Waves meets Grace!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Victor & Geddy Lee solo cds are both much better I have to say!
4,No escape,"Sounds like a lot of noise at first. ""One Little Victory"" hammers away. ""Ceiling Unlimited"" sounds almost the same. Hey, there is a nice melody bit it ""Ghost Rider"". LN says the guitars sound like Placebo (maybe, but then, Placebo haven't been around half as long). Why do I listen to ""Peaceable Kingdom"" twice? Preparing breakfast, I put on ""Secret Touch"". Rather loud, not only because the coffee-maker is rattling. And then, on my way to work, looking across the city, a sliver of sun spilling out on the houses and green, I have ""Earthshine"" in my head. It fits. It looks glorious. Now it spins. At my desk, I zip through ""Vapor Trail"" and grind ""Freeze"" into my ears. And again.I thought I'd hate this album. It has grabbed me. No escape."
1,Worst Rush Album Ever,"I own every Rush album and have been a fan since 1978. This album sucks. Geddy Lee holds each syllable of every word he sang for an extended period of time and ruined this album. Alex Lifeson's guitar work is lazy and unimaginative. The only redeeming quality of this work is Neil Peart's drumming which as usual is excellent. Please go back to the drawing board and produce a great album. If you want to listen to Rush then buy Caress of Steel, Hemispheres, Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, Roll the Bones or Counterparts.... Throw this CD in the trash."
4,Return to Form...almost,"I really like the spirit of this album. The music is wonderful, lyrics ok, and overall enjoyable. I know they're not really progressive anymore but I really like the song Vapor Trails...reminds me of the glory days of Rush. This album is a vast improvement over the horrendous ""Test for Integrity...er Echo"". I did not really like Counterparts that much either. But, this album has some great music. Stay away from the ""de de de de Yea"" album- their latest one where they do cover songs. One thing for sure, Rush must have never been a good cover band!"
4,Peart bears his soul,"Rush should have never released this album. Drummer Neal Peart lost both his daughter and lover within a year of each other. The devastated Peart went on a long motorcycle tour to find out what was left inside of himself. He gave no thought to working with his Canadian band mates. Eventually, he healed enough to start doing what he did best: make music. Vapor Trails is the result. It's muscular. Its heaviness harkens back to Rush's 2112. Peart goes all out with intricate drum work that sounds almost impossible for a man to perform. Geddy Lee sings Peart's lyrics with his unforgettable voice that doesn't try to do too much. Alex Lifeson throws out plenty of thick chords from his guitar, but he needed to do more solos. (Where have guitar solos gone in rock music?) Knowing Peart's story opens a window into the lyrics on the album. ""Ghost Rider"" is Peart's journey around North America trying to heal his soul. ""Secret Touch"" is Peart dealing with his loss."
3,Trying too hard,"I've been a Rush fan for 20 years, and while I think this album is the best they've put out in about 10 years, it still does not capture me like the Rush from the 70's and 80's. They seem to be trying to hard to not repeat themselves. And while I appreciate them trying to not repeat themselves (many bands need help in that arena), they're just not finding a groove I can get into. No doubt there is an amazing amount of talent in this trio, and the mix of the album sounds incredible, and there are several good songs to be discovered, but it's just not quite what I'd hoped for. I read an interview with Geddy Lee years ago where he expressed his frustration with fans who didn't want Rush to change and grow as a band. By all means, keep growing and re-invent yourselves, but don't expect your fan base to fully embrace the result."
5,Glad they're back,"It is great to have a new Rush album, after our long wait. It has a ""wall of sound"" feel in many places that is different from previous albums. But different is Ok, it is a nice direction for them to be going. I might complain that Geddy's vocals are a little far down in the mix. But that said - this will be my most played album of the year. Nice job guys."
2,where the boys go,"i've been a rush fan for 25 years .Always could count on them for great sounds,but with vapor trails all I hear is noise.Listen to the cd half a dozen times hoping and trying to like it.I tried ,i really did.Where did alex's great solos go. The nice crisp sounds and defined playing. Kick this to the curb. I sure hope the new cd Snakes and Arrows brings it on."
4,Not Zelda but It's Still Good,"Aidyns Chronicles is an excellent RPG if you forget about the Zelda series. In Aidyns Chronicles you get to take on the role of ten different characters, being upto a maximum of four at any one time. There is plenty of variation in this game as the tasks can be completed in any particular order. This is a great game and lets hope that they hurry up and supply us with a sequel"
5,Aidyn Chronicles The first Mage,I gave this game five stars because it has a great story line plenty of action and the fantasy that all of the great RPGs have. The graphics aren't the best but the game is awesome.You should get this game if you have the chance!
5,Aidyn chronicles,I thought that the game lacked some fundumental basics of newcoming adventures and missions. The game tends to get repetitive towards the end. Altogether this is still a high quality game.
2,Stop locking,I used them on a display case. OK for awhile then stopped locking. I bought 4 and all didn't work after locking and unlocking several times all stopped working.
1,More Crap from NOVL,"This software is an embarrasement. I installed on my compaq P3 laptop. Pretty standard hardware with Dlink Wireless card. Video and hardware problems just like the previous versions. At least this version would boot, but that was about it. No wireless support for the D-Link Cards. Open Office.org, don't even get me started what a joke. I opened simple documents from MS Office nothing was compatable. Slow and unresponsive beyond belief. Same laptop has dual boot XP and Office 2003 outperforms this crap 50 times over. Don't believe the anything you read from linux mags download the free version from NOVL and see for yourself this software is total crap. Whatever you do don't pay for it. They will have to pay me to install it again after this disappointment."
4,Ragga Styleeeeeeee,"Nuf respect for dis ragga man, enjoy a good night bogeling wit ya man. Get u on a good tip. Top CD."
2,TOTALLY REDUNDANT,"Every one of these songs sound the same. This is totally ridiculous and unacceptable. I would NOT recommend this CD. If you're going to have a compilation, at least make it a variety of songs! GOOD GRIEF!"
3,Reel Retro,"Nice collection of bluesy, jazzy tunes from the likes of Etta James, Dean Martin, Mel Torme and other. Queen Latifah surprises with her good vocals on a few tracks. The only song that seems out of place is Brownstone's ""If You Love Me"", an uptempo R&B song. The screenwriter said that he was listening to that song a lot as he was writing. The lyrics of the song make sense for the movie, but the music style does not. Otherwise, this soundtrack would fit nicely in your film music collection."
3,Mediocrity at it's Best....,"It's beyond me how people can give this cd 4 and 5 stars and not mention the great Etta James, Mel Torme, or Dean Martin in favor of the greatest mediocricy since oleo became margarine: Queen Latifah. If it weren't for the aforementioned superstars and Brownstone, this cd would be as exciting to listen to as watching paint dry. I know Latifah is all popular and things, but has musical taste gone out the window?? She is NO Pearl Bailey and that comparison is growing thinner than Oprah! Latifah's singing at best is on the high end of karaoke. Now, I really like to see the Queen acting it up all over the screen, she does have talent. And I'm not hating, but there's no way in heck the Queens vocals help this cd along. Sure, the songs here are better than her solo effort of jazz standards, but they do not stand out by any stretch of the imagination. Oy!!"
2,Not worth the money,"Cute but the only time you can tell the puppy grows and first time out of the box, otherwise it is really unnoticeble."
5,An awesome book,"This book is awesome for basic ideas and a great foundation of knowledge. Now he needs to make an ""Advanced"" book, that would incorporate advanced builds, and step by step stuff."
5,great build guide,This was an impulse buy for me. I was thinking about getting a cherokee for a while. Bought this and a week later bought a cherokee lol. Great book.
4,Interesting read,"There is alot of good information in this book, it reads more like a magazine article though. It illustrates what is possible with enough money and time well enough."
3,"Not bad, but could be better","This headset is light and quite comfortable. It's unlikely that I will continue to use it however.There is no built in volume/mute on it, and I could live with that, however the volume on them mic was very low. I had to turn the volume pickup on the PC to maximum and speak quite loudly in order to be heard.This may work better for other applications (telephone or whatnot), but as a PC voice chat headset it was not the best.Oh one other thing I like in a boom is a little more flexibility. This one moves up and down only, I like one that moves out a little so it's not pressing right up against my face."
3,The white man controls history,"Nothing against O'Brien who can write a good line, but this book would have been so much believeable if written by a Native American. Otherwise, it amounts to not much more than historical plagiarism and smoke and mirrors."
3,Okay floor toy,"We tried this in the crib at first, it was so big and bulky. We then moved it to the floor, that works much better. The squeaker just went out on it but everything else works great. It keeps her interest for awhile and she plays with it daily at 8 months old."
2,Disappointed big time,"I like Teddy Atlas. I like to listen to him analyze a fight. I like that he held a gun to Mike Tyson's head and later walked away from him even though he knew that nutjob could make him millions. I like the whole idea of Teddy Atlas. I didn't like the book though.If I had to read one more story about Teddy beating the b'jesus out of a guy, or better yet, out of a group of guys, I think I would have lost my lunch right into the book. His hands must be sore to this day from all the beatdowns he administered. Take it easy there Francis. Where do you bury your dead? If you were that tough you wouldn't have brought the gun along when you went to see Tyson.He doesn't come across that way on television, so I was very surprised, but to me the tone of the book was such that as I was reading I was afraid he was gonna come through the pages and catch me with a right cross if my mind wandered."
2,it is a slow product,I used this Lexar memory stick more few years. however recently I trieda used SONY Memory stick from my friend then I notice this one is veryslow during down loading my pictures. I guess I learned not to get aftermarket products.
4,Great Action Packed Duo !!!,"The Fifth Element is one of the classic action/sci-fi movies you have to have if you like futuristic- crazy action driven fun. The movie in Blu-ray has the highest level of quality you can get, these are the updated/remastered versions, though the filming quality at the time was not as great as it is today. Because of this, don't expect the visual clarity and perfection of movies like Avatar, as it was done in 1997. Overall Gattaca and The Fifth Element are great to have in a collection."
5,Hysterically pleasing.,"I bought this book to read to my family over holiday break and sat down with little kids, friends, grandparents and parents present. Not only did I have trouble reading it without snorting but my grandmother almost peed her pants laughing so hard. Acceptance is the only lesson you will get out of this book. This book was written for humor only. If you've ever owned a dog, you know most of this book is exaggeratingly true. Great for all ages. Strange, yet intriguing illustrations."
4,liked it alot,The story was funny. nice pictures. it's so awesome! I liked it a lot. I would like to read more.
5,Very Funny and Real,"Come on....who doesn't fart. Why not have a little fun . As long as we teach a children when and where to fart why can't we have a little fun with it????? We have a dog that farts all the time so for my son's first birthday he received this book and Walter the farting dog from his sister, his black lab, pretty silly but cute."
5,very pleased,The book came in excellent condition and on time. It is a gift that was well received. Everything went well.
1,"Crude, Rude & It's Been Done Better","What is going on with the world? Yes, kids will get a huge kick out of ""Walter the Farting Dog,"" because they think flatulence is hysterically funny. But the illustrations in this book are ugly, the subject matter is dubious--and the story itself reminded me of a genuinely cute and clever book published several years ago. ""Dog Breath"" by Dav Pilkey is the story of a dog whose breath knocks everyone out, but he becomes a hero when his ""hairy-tosis"" knocks out a couple of burglars the day before he was to be given away. ""Walter the Farting Dog"" also becomes a hero when he--ahem--gasses out a pair of burglars.If you want a cute story about a dog with an embarrassing medical condition, ""Dog Breath"" is far more appealing."
3,Cute Book,Cute book that is sure to keep kids laughing. If you like this book you should try Patches' Awesome Day... another very cute kids book with great illustrations!
2,Just Read It at the Book Store,"I have a three and five year old. I picked up the book to preview it before making the purchase. I'm glad I did. It sounded hilarious, but fell short of expectations. I felt it was not at all original. The story was almost the same as ""Dog Breath"" by Dav Pilkey (which my kids enjoy). So I wasn't as charmed by the story. I noticed other reviewers made this observaton too.Also, I'm okay with the occasional potty-humor, but this book is a little over-the-top. The word, ""fart"" is mentioned so frequently it got tiresome to read. Before you make the purchase, might I suggest, if you're buying this book for children who can't read yet, you might want to THINK how you feel about reading ""FART"" OUT LOUD over and over again at story-time.If you're OK with that, and you've never read ""Dog Breath"" this might be one to add to you're collection. I did like the illustrations, but decided to pass on the purchase."
1,"Disappointing! Not a funny, positive story. Is love conditional?","I bought this book because of the reviews and the funny title. We love books and find books like ""Everyone Poops"" funny and well thought out.Walter the Farting Dog has a lot of problems:1) The concept that if there's something wrong with you (Walter farts) that you will be sent away (to the pound)2) The story is not enforce the concept of unconditional love. We don't love you. Oh, you saved the house? Well, I guess we love you now despite your farting3) Burglars coming into the house--scary for some kids.4) The illustrations are HORRIBLE. Everyone looks like mutated zombies.Save your money and spend the time reading a much better book. I have stuck this one to the back of the bookcase. Nobody in the house likes this one once they open it."
5,"Walter, the Farting Dog","I happened upon this book at a small book store and bought it based on the title.My daughters, ages 6 & 2, loved it! We read it together twice for bedtime.It's a very comical look at how a family learns to accept Walter for who he is."
5,"Awesome book, thanks!",I would just like to say thanks for these great books! I have 2 boys and they think burping and farting are 2 of the greatest and funniest things they can do! Both books are great stories and keep us laughing!!!
4,Stinky Fun,"It made me laugh so hard the first time through outloud I couldn't get through the pages. We have our own farting dog in our house, too...and he gets the blame a lot more than his share! I agree, the word ""fart"" is a bit overused. It would have been funnier to come up with a few other creative descriptions, but it is fun and the kids LOVE it."
4,"Lightweight, goofy potty humor","Maybe you have to be an eight year old boy to appreciate the depths of this story, though I suspect that being eight and a boy are both optional. It is what the title tells: Fido and flatus. Dog-flatus, with that special something that brings tears to your eyes.It's short, the kind you can easily finish for a read-to-me kid between tucking in and lights out. It has a moral, with many socially upright bits tucked in. And it has the little guy, the one with an unattractive problem despite himself.The kid you buy this for will thank you. The kid's parents are another story, though.//wiredweird"
3,interesting overview of the financial markets...,"but with all due respect to the author, whom I hold in the highest esteem, this book is NOT for those looking for insights in to investment strategies. the man is a legend, and has a well deserved stellar reputation. this book is a great overview of the financial markets, but will not help you make money. am I too bottom line focused? perhaps, but be aware of the limitations of this book before purchasing it."
5,High quality and slim design,Great product. Very slim with high joule rating and low price! Buy this Tripp-Lite which is 100x better than the similar priced cheap-o no-name models sold at CVS and Walmart with no joule rating and no illuminated power toggle switch.
5,celebration barbie,Hi i was really excited with my purchase of the celebration barbie! It came in a nice box with padding careful not to dent the box too. My niece collects Barbies and I am thrilled to keep this in my closet till Christmas! Who can beat the price it was at one time a 39.00 dollar doll to hear my sister tell it.I got it for 6.00 at their amazon toy outlet sale and free shipping!YEAthe doll is delicate and any girl or grown girl would love to play with it although we most likely will put it in a doll case....sondra in Louisian
4,"Pro Wrestling's Ultimate Insider, Vol. 5 and 6: Jeff Hardy/Matt Hardy",thanks for the kool dvd it came in good time
1,Should be less than 1 star,"A friend broght this CD to work for us to listen to as a joke and believe me it is a joke. It came out about the same time as ""This is Spinal Tap"" and it is just as bad, except BOC was serious! It is one of the worst combinations of 80's glam-hair pop-metal I have heard. Think of the review of ""Smell the Glove"" (""---- sandwich"")."
4,Headphones are 5 star when submerged,"The headphones are basic when played above water - but are superior when submerged. Also the ear plugs mention that they can be trimmed, I tried that and cut it too close. I will say that H2 Audio was very responsive to helping me correct my mistake. I am highly impressed with both the company and their merchandise."
1,Lack of Customer Service,"I ordered pants for a wedding and I got a conformation saying they were on the way, but little did I know they canceled the order and never told me. And better yet, the pant size is still listed on this page. Don't waste your time."
1,SHOULD BE TITLED- burt AND ME!!!!!,"Terribly boring!!! I wanted to finally read a book about Burt that would share more about the man behind the image. Instead I found out more about the author. The author spent entirely too much time on sharing her feelings and what she did and how terribly important she was. Don't waste your time. If you want to read a good book about Burt, read his autobiography!"
5,Great Book.....,"This book is wonderful, easy to read and I love it. Everyone I speak to about the biography of St.Therese the Little Flower ends up getting a copy of this book. It's a wonderful read. You can't put the book down. You actually fall in love with St.Therese after reading this book. She's an amazing Saint and Friend."
2,Not so Jackie...,"This movie is absolutely horrible. You can tell that Jacqueline Susann was cooler then her time because if read the book and then watch this movie its a little apparent that people back then just didn't get it.I wouldn't be surprised if Jackie and Irving walked out of this film premier like she did with the opening of 'Valley'.The story line is completely watered down, the characters aren't even in the right order and their are even rediculous plots in the movie that aren't even in the book.A rule of thumb, Jackie Susann's books were not trash, the movies made about them were.The only exciting thing about this movie is that you get to see Jackie's cameo as a news reporter in the film. And this is the only reason why I want them to release it on DVD. There just might be some interesting back stage commentary/material on Jackie in the extra features."
5,Review the album,"How about this: Try just reviewing the album, instead of ""wowing"" everybody with your Pink Floyd trivia. Everybody is SO impressed by your knowledge of the history of Waters. It's worth commending you on that. I didn't know if I'd like this Waters compilation, but you telling me that you know about the Pink Floyd break up is way more important. Who cares about the album or what your opinion was. Tell us about The Final Cut, and how it was mostly Waters' album. That's much more relevant than the actual album being reviewed. You are my Pink Floyd trivia idol! Do you have an address I could mail money to?Do you need a peticure? Can I drive you to the airport if you need to catch a flight, so you can tell me more about Pink Floyd? As long as you avoid reviewing Waters' compilation of solo work, I'll do anything for you!!!"
5,really good smooth jazz,"really nice guitar work""a la Wes Montgomery"",and good band too,for the lovers of jazz guitar ,good vibraphone too."
2,Buy the Chef's Classic version instead,"I have a number of the MultiClad Pro pans and really like them. I wanted to add the steamer insert, and tried both the MultiClad Pro and Chef's Classic versions. They are slightly different (although not as different as I had hoped -- this piece does not feature the same matte stainless exterior finish as the rest of the MultiClad Pro line.) I found that the Chef's Classic version actually fit my MultiClad Pro pans better, so I am returning this one."
5,Light and easy!,"I love my new steamer insert! I had bought a similar one for my boyfriend a year ago after watching him wrestle with a traditional expanding steamer insert and a fork and he said the new insert was life changing. I then searched from store to store to get one for myself but they had been discontinued... I finally found this one on Amazon and absolutely love it. Its very lightweight and comes with its own top (with my boyfriend's i had to purchase that seperately), and using it is super easy, too! Veggies steam in no time and they are super delicious and healthy. I definitely would recommend buying one."
4,versatile,"Very nice steamers works with many different pans. 2,3 or4 quart also fits in sauteed pans. Love it! I am very pleased with all my cuisinart cookware!."
1,WEW Lost,In one word this is a lousy DVD. It is the worst of the genre. It is also too short but it is better that way. too bad i cannot get a refund. Also Christina Ricci (film Actress) is not in this title. Shoddy advertising.
3,"This book will please fans, and irk collectors","The book definitely has an entertaining value, but as far as a book for collectors, it isn't up to par. Most of the sections on Harry Potter collectables are not up to date, and they feature very vague values or prices. I think the reason is that Harry Potter merchandise is fairly new, and so it is hard to calculate an item's worth when it just came on to the market.The book also includes several interesting sections on the upcoming movie, JK Rowling, and England, which are mildly entertaining. The thing that I thought was the most appealing in the book, however, was a section on Harry Potter around the world. I found it very interesting to see the covers of the Harry Potter books in Germany, France, Japan, and many other countries. Out of everything, I would say that that section helps redeem this book, which is otherwise a failure."
1,"do not read this ""book""","this ""book"" is the worst book i have ever read. the reason is because the ""author"" is putting 101 advertizements for harry potter mechandise. i reapeat myself, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!"
4,great resource,"I am not a beginner as far as singing goes, but I am changing genres from classical singing to jazz and blues. I wanted to know how to sing the blues well and do it justice. There were some things I didn't know, such as the blues scale. I liked the banter between the two on the video. Brings it some personality, but everyone is different. I didn't agree with everything said on the vocal basics side. That video is done by someone else who isn't really connected with the blues singing. But I think the blues side of the video was helpful to me as a musician trying to try something new."
4,One of the Best Toto Albums,"Isolation was probably my favorite album I listened to through my first year in college. Unfortunately, Toto never scored very well on the charts with cuts from this album, which I never realy understood.Every song on the album (aside from Holyanna, which I think pretty much was a waste of time) was wonderfully written, produced, and recorded. Slow ballads are awesomely done by these guys, especially ""How Does it Feel"".Favorite songs from Isolation include: Isolation / Angel Don't Cry / How Does it Feel / Lion / EndlessGet this CD if you've never bought a Toto CD before. This and Toto IV are really really good!Peace Out."
2,180 degrees...,"Released: Nov 1984 Produced by: Toto(Were 1/2 stars available, would rate a 2-1/2.) Jarring style reversal following departure of Bobby Kimball, featuring sterile note-hitting yeller Fergie Frederiksen. Frederiksen lacks Kimball's soul, feel, & balls, yet somehow musician's ever-resourceful grasp on whatever style they choose rescues album from possible disaster. Steve Porcaro's classical keyboard vignettes seamlessly team with Steve Lukather's more up-front rock riffs, and Jeff Porcaro gets a workout, but rocking set feels emotion-free. David Paich sings lead on a mere 2-1/2 songs out of 10--most he would on any subsequent album (weak single ""Stranger In Town"" and silly Holyanna""). Standouts: Journey-esque title track, Kimball co-written ""Lion,"" neo-classical pop metal ""Change Of Heart."" Original bassist Mike Porcaro's recorded debut with band. Most fans had no idea what to make of this. Aficionados only."
2,Not Good,"Would an FBI agent really act this way? If they did, would we want them in the FBI? Improbable plot, ridiculous characters, not one of his best. Why do so many of Stephen White's females characters have physical problems?"
3,A little disappointing ...,"I may have been expecting too much, but I found this Stephen White book falling a little short of all the hype. It is, however, the first of his books that I have read and I think I will give another one a try before I mark him off my ""must read"" list."
4,Entertaining popular fiction,"Yes, there are times when the plot becomes a bit too unbelievable. But the plot is compelling enough that you just shrug and continue reading. White is a very good story teller, and most of his characters are complicated and interesting. I'm not one to read best sellers, but I found this one quite entertaining."
5,"Unique Book, Lovely Stories","Like to be able to speak Chinese but even the thought of studying it intimidates the pants off you? You might be pleasantly surprised once you read ten pages into Swallowing Clouds. A. Zee is a wonderfully patient, fun teacher. You won't learn Chinese simply be reading this book but you might just get hooked enough to want to learn more. So this book is a great starting point. You will learn some very interesting stuff about Chinese food and culture."
3,Canton but not Sechzuan,"Very well researched,a little too sweet,not very hot. A pleasant little book that reflects the title, will be an asset to planning travel and entertaining. Wonderful recipes, an insight into the humor and creativity of the Chinese.Money well spent as a gift book."
1,Not a good value,"I was under the impression that this was a 5 pack of 5 packs for a total of 25 blades. It is not. At a cost of $1.00 a blade it is a lot more expensive than other sellers here on Amazon that will also give you free shipping and for less than a dollar more give you 15 X-acto blades--roughly $0.40 a blade.Update: the price has come down a little with the free shipping but I'd recommend these blades instead at $0.20 a piece they are great quality and a much better value:X-Acto X611 #11 Blades for X-Acto Knives, Bulk Pack, 100 Blades per Box"
4,Great Read at 14,"When I was a kid (many years ago now), I read this book. I still see Desmond Bagley as the natural successor to Alistair Maclean. If Maclean had zero percent sex in his books (where there is a female character as in 'The Golden Rendezvous', she hates the hero), Desmond Bagley gets to maybe 2 percent - he does have some alluring female characters. But it is all sooo British. This book is an excellent read, with the hero and the reader uncertain as to what is going on as the plot slowly unfolds."
4,it works,"A quick easy read, that leaves you thinking, why not? I may as well give it a go. I started with small things, like asking for a parking space outside the hairdressers, and it worked! Now I ask the Universe for something everyday and things are definately looking up."
1,messed up ancient concept,"Well I never! What a cleaver idea, but did it really need 112 pages to tell us what we have been doing for years? I rate Cainer's cosmic book a better read than this, and even better again are the cosmic books by Andronicou and Richards. This for me did not give enough coverage to the origination of this ancient concept or its progression to the present time. It is just claimed that Mohr is responsible for cosmic ordering being in existence, which of course is a ridiculous claim. No one can claim to have carte blanche over the origination. What follows in the book is just a story of how Mohr went against the wishes of her friend and tried to prove this concept did not work by thinking negatively, but somehow what she had written down came about. This would seem to dumbfound the law of attraction about attracting what you think of."
4,Celebration Barbie (A/A),I actually bought this for my seven year old to start a collection since she loves Barbie. Barbie is now out of the box and being played with her other Barbies. My daughter loves her long hair and her gown. She is a very beautiful doll and compared to other African-American Barbies she has realistic features and beauty. The beautiful gown she wears is also quite durable and did not come apart like some of her other Barbie's outfits who were suppose to be princesses. Every once in awhile Celebration Barbie gets to go back to her included display stand where she looks just as nice. This is one of the best Barbie's I have bought especially at the toy outlet price. This is a great deal!
2,Celebration Barbie 2000 Special Edition - African American,"I was totally disappointed with my purchase. The doll was in good condition but the box was very worn. My dolls are for display, and to give to my grandchildren when they are older for their collection. I display in their box, and the box was a taped up mess, not just the bottom missing. Therefore, the doll is not good for my collection. My fault for not reading well, I want new items and I will be more careful on future purchases."
5,Second Time Around,"I had this book for my grandchildren, who just loved it. Now I have two wonderful little girls living next door so I ordered it for them. They are just as enthralled with it as my granddaughter was. They go around singing ""Peanut Butter, Peanut Butter, Jelly Jelly."" I'm so glad it was still available."
3,Racism and 1940's Hollywood,"It's funny, reading these reviews no one has commented on the obvious. I live in Europe and was treated to a documentary on RKO pictures that featured commentary on Welles and gave true insite on the making of this film. Included was a letter sent to an RKO exec by one of Welles's film crew, that acted as a spy for the Studio. The letter basically described the making of the film as Welles ""hanging out in Nigger neighborhoods, filming a bunch of Jigaboos jumping up and down"". The Brazilian government objected to the film because it offered the outside world a glimpse of the real demographic ""warts and all""(70% of the population was of African heritage), the racism and poverty that existed in spite of a desire to depict and exploit the ""exotic beauty"" of our South American neighbors.Welles was ahead of his time and he no doubt paid the price for it in a world that even today ""Just can't handle the truth""."
1,Scripture twisting at it's worst,"The book has 2 stated goals:1. Get people out of debt.2. Get church members to blindly give 10% (at least) of their income to the local Church.Number 1 is a noble goal. Number 2 runs counter to true Christian stewardship. True stewardship teaches that 100% of our time, treasure, and talent belongs to the Lord, not just 10% of our income. Even in the OT, the poor RECEIVED tithes, not paid them. How seriously wrong to exact money from the poor in the name of God. If the poor give, it should be of a freewill offering. This book uses the typical out-of-context Scripture twisting to justify the ungodly ""give-to-get"" perverted Gospel teaching.For the truth on tithing, please read a much better book: ""Should the Church Teach Tithing"" by Dr. Russell. It tells more about how tithing was done in the OT, and why it is inappropriate to teach it as a Christian practice for today."
1,It's passable if you enjoy overly-simple rhyme...,"I'm afraid I don't understand what has happened to the art of writing rhyme. I don't mean to offend this author, but I have taught poetry to 5th graders who were capable of writing rhymed (and unrhymed) poems that surpassed those in this book! And this author wins awards (?). Children's poetry in general has hit a low - it is rare to find poems that contain the kind of imagery that makes you shiver, and the new rhymes are unimaginative, not very clever at all. I certainly beleive in having a good laugh with good rhyme, but I'm afraid these don't do it for me (and the kids in my library never check it out)..."
3,"Funny,witty, and insightful...just like her!","I'm a huge fan of Patty Heaton! I loved her humor and am truly amazed at everything she experienced along the way to stardom and love. I enjoyed the funny and insightful look into her life experiences, but would also enjoy a deeper look into her true feelings about life, love, family, religion, etc. Would love to see her write another book!!! :)"
3,Nice anecdotes,"I enjoyed this book and appreciated Ms. Heaton's humor, and her recounting of her childhood and forays into the entertainment industry.It does seem to sit right on the edge of everything that gets discussed ~ almost like she wants to tell you about stuff, but not get into too much meaty detail.My favorite aspect is Ms. Heaton's referring to her British husband by practically everything but his name - that alone makes this book worth reading. Also, when she talks about her father, the reader can sense the love that's there.Only downside is the occasional braggy tone she takes ~ a bit of a turnoff."
5,Invaluable Tool,"Have you ever met someone and immediately felt drawn to them? This book will explain why! You can also predict, through the use of easy-to-use tables where you might have problems in relationships you currently have."
3,Bag Boutique by Amy Barickman,The patterns for purses in this book are marvelous and I want to make all of them. The instructions are quite clear and explitive but have only one complaint about the book. The patterns are not in actual size and all have to be taken to a printer to be enlarged 200% and for someone who doesn't get out too often this is an inconvenience but I will do it because the purses are so functional and uniique.
2,Got the wrong book,"Actually I intended to order another book ""Ramp Plans: Learn How to Build Vert Street Mini Launch and Bowls (2000 Edition)"", but by mistake seem to have ordered this one instead without realising it before it arrived. Must be my mistake where as I should have noticed this in the confirmation email I got. Still, better luck next time..."
3,A standard sword and socery novel with some twists.,"The Shadow Stone is fairly typical of Forgotten Realms novels; the downtrodden hero rises from humble beginnings to save the world. Mr. Baker did a good job of fleshing out his main character, including both light and dark sides. Supporting characters, with exception of the main villian, were rather weak and often lost in storm surrounding the lead character.The plot moved quickly, keeping my interest. The ending was predictable, but consistant with the overall storyline. This book is not my favorite from the Forgotten Realms setting, but it was pleasant to read."
3,Good movie,"The movie has little plot, what do you think from a porm movie. Beside that it's a very good movie."
2,Get their first four albums before you get this,"For me, X was never the same after Billy Zoom left.This album is OK, but not a standout. ""4th of July"" is a good song, and the title song is OK, but a lot more mainstream than I'd like."
2,Primos E-Deer Call,"I decided to try out this call for this year's season because I already have the Invisa-Doe and Invisa-Buck calls that I bought last year. This Primos unit is NOT loud enough and I'm NOT impressed by the sound quality as I was with the Invisa-Doe brand. These are cheaper, so I guess you get what you pay for. I would NOT recommend these Primos units. Pay more and get a better e-deer call."
2,The E definitely stands for electronic,This deer caller is not worth the money!When you push the rattle button it makes a high pitch noise when the horns hit sounds nothing like the real thing Neither does the grunt or the snort-wheezes the only thing that sounds even remotely close is the bleat and that still sounds fake trust me I have heard all of these in the woods from real deer doing it at each other and at me. I bought this one because it was cheap but I highly regret it now. If u are thinking about buying this item don't spend the extra 20 to 30$ and get a better one. PLEASE TAKE MY ADVICE.
3,Great Heavy Slider - Nut and bolts don't Match?!?,"This would be an easy 5 stars. Heavy duty, slides easily, locks and latch releases convenient and excellent durability. Very adjustable. My server cases are much shorter than my SAN case, fully adjusted and still very sturdy. Why 3 stars? The mounting nuts do not match the bolts! Will not thread on! I purchased 2 of these units, not a fluke, both delivered items had the problem. Went to local shop and purchased the right bolt for the provided nuts. How do you ship a product where the threads don't match? Bewildered. It's a shame a great product like this would have such a crazy problem."
4,all yinz can eat at the grand buffet,This album is fresh. Great grooves with fun lyrics. my only beef is that it's less than 30 minutes long. i want more buffet!
4,"Nice, but...","I'm a fan of the Ghibli animators, I'm a graphic designer and illustrator. This kind of book is a must have for anyone who is in the same situation that I am.There is only one problem: compared to the original edition, in Japanese, the material used in the cover is different (VIZ used hard cover, against Tokuma Shoten's soft cover with canvas-textured paper) what changes the sense of this book, putting it onto a higher level - but that's only a design book for animation."
5,"Read the book, then judge it....","I have some doubts that ""danielclark"" actually read the book before he summarily passed judgement on it. A careful reading of the actual book reveals a highly balanced perspective on business and the corporate world. The author is not antibusiness or marxist, but rather classically conservative in that he advocates for corporate power being subordinate to the needs and rights of the people. A reviwer should know what he's reviewing, or else his thoughts on a particular work are utterly worthless."
1,A Pattern?,"Once again, an MSIA book being reviewed exclusively by MSIA rank and file, with (except for one) only one review under their name, which is this book. Does this sound weird to you?"
4,"Xacto X3202 NO,2 Medium Weight Precicion Knife",i bought this knife to carve my pumpkin and it does a great clean job. my pumpkins never looked that good before lol
4,As Long As You're Aware....,"If you are looking to learn Signed English, the language taught in signing schools for the Deaf, and converse with a deaf child, this is a wonderful book. It has great illustrations and is very easy to sort through. As long as you are aware that the signs in this book are NOT signs that ADULT deaf people use, you're OK. Don't get Signed English and American Sign Language confused. But, again, if you want English signs for a child, this book is well worth the money. :o)"
2,An Ounce of Information,"""An Ounce of Preservation"" is more aptly described as a pamphlet which delivers only the most BASIC information that most people nowadays regard as common knowledge. The reader looking for practical help, such as what solution to use to clean a smudged photo from the twenties, will find very little to go by (no more than a three-sentence paragraph for the cleaning of old photos). This thin book might have been more successful if the author had limited his scope and treated his subject in more detail. As it is, it's a lot to pay for text that can be read in less than an hour."
2,this condo is only for kittens,"my cat is 2 and a half years old and she weighs about 14lbs. the only part of her body that seems to fit in the condo is her head. Although i believe she could squeeze in there, she gets freaked out easily and she is scared to try to get her body in there. it's a cute idea with the velcro and all but i think it should be sold to people that have kittens so they can get used to it. (and i got mine for $20 so at least i didn't pay too much to find out that my cat can't use it...)"
3,"Hey, this isn't a pep talk","The reason some readers are turned off by this book is because Kagen's opening point is that not everybody can sing professionally, no matter how much training they receive (just like the point that some people aren't ever going to be cut out for professional basketball). That said, Kagen does have some good things to say about the importance of developing your inner ear and not getting bogged down by too much technical twaddle. If you want to read about singing or learning how to sing, this probably shouldn't be your first book, but it shouldn't be the last you get around too, either. Other helpful books are by Clifton Ware, Richard Miller, and James McKinney."
2,Despite all of the excitement,"Despite all of the excitement of kidnappings, royalty, and terroizes it didn't hide the fact the charactors were dull. There was nothing exciting or special or even memerable about any of the charactors."
1,Beware!,"This is EW&F's worst album by far! Steer away! This album alone summons the worst of everything from the 80s & the ""songs! are non-existing. Don't say I didn't warn ya! (Magnetic is a little funny though, in a comical sense)."
3,It was ok....,"Sorry, I don't know what the hype is all about. It was pretty interesting at parts but I just didn't feel the love between the characters, especially from zsadist. And the names of the brothers...ugh. And Zsadist's name has got to be the worst. I kept getting all the mr. O,U....X,Y,Z mixed up. And the Brothers do drugs... c'mon!!! NOT HOT! I can deal the the tats, nipple rings, even the wanna-be gangster slang...but ""smoking up"" together, geez, I think the author is trying too hard. But if you can overlook all that, it had it's good parts."
5,Best out of the first 3,"I think I enjoyed this one out of the first three the best because the plot seemed to have a bit more depth. I could NOT wait until this main character had a book written about him. (Something about the wounded type that seems appealing.) Also, the main female character was very multi sided and interesting. Once again, I was done in a day and could not put it down. Like most series books, by the 2nd or 3rd book, the reader starts to see the recipe. However, these are still awesome to read!"
3,Zsadist's story,"Well, the book made it to my door via the mail, I had been waiting for 10 days and I was so, excited when it got here.But, I was not thrilled with this story, in fact, I was disapointed, I could not get into Zsadist's stoyr the way I did the some other characters from the fyrst two books.In fact I just found the Rev in this book more intruiqing than the main character, and I would not be surprised if he got a storyline of his own. I think that he has a bortherhood connection that is going to come along.In fact I'm waiting on V's story, not Butch's, even Zsadist's brother's story Phury is going to be interesting. But I will keep reading, Jr.Ward is still the best our there for the pharanormal romance.While this is not a top review, it is not so bad. I just hope she does not loose her edge like so many authers have done, at first they sizzile and the dizzzzzzmal road to boredom happens."
5,Black Dagger Brother Zsadist,"Zsadist's story is sad, touching, truthful and beautiful. It's not an easy read, tears will be involved, but well worth the pain as you delve further into his life. It's not a book that you can read just once. It's a story that keeps getting better each time you open the book. It's amazing."
5,PERFECT.,"Zsadist isn't broken, he's ruined. Broken can be fixed. This about sums up who Z is. A former blood slave, who is so damaged by his past that he is considered nothing but a savage by anyone who knows him, even his own Black Dagger Brothers.Bella is an aristocratic beauty. The moment she has a run in with Z, she wants him. Z has the same reaction to Bella but has a hard time dealing with it. In his eyes, she's too good for him & he's terrified of feeling, touching, being touched. He's ruined.This is one of my all time favorite books. I've read it many times & will read it many more. It really doesn't get much better than this. And yes, I recommend reading the first two books, Dark Lover & Lover Eternal, before starting this one. Z & Bella first meet in book 2 & it's pretty damn hot!"
1,Cheap and flimsey metal for the price,"I have never been this disappointed in an item that I bought off of Amazon. It was $60, yet cheaply made of extremely flimsy metal. It came in a thin box with no packing. It arrived with multiple dents in it. Not sure to take the trouble of sending it back or just throw it in the garbage!Do not waste your money!!!"
1,Extremely mediocre & extremely non evidence based,"All clinician-scientist as well as lay people intheir right mind believe in evidence base medicineThis kind of lay discussion on 'exercises' withoutdetailed recourse to evidence, nor comparison betweendifferent exercise programs, and omission of a decentdiscussion of the causes of back pain as well aselementary stuff like red flags make this bookextremely extremely mediocre. Extremely not up to standard"
3,Lost....,"I was hearing non-stop buzz about this show and was very interested in seeing it. Yes, there is hope left for the Network Televisioin Stations. Great premise and great writing (at times) gives this series a real drive that is completely LOST on just about anything left on Network TV these days. Just wish that the writing was consistent....there are a few absolutely terrible episodes thrown in the mix alongside some great moments....very strange...almost like the producers forgot to go to the discussion room that week.....anyway...definitely worth the buy, should be a good series to own for years to come. Because, of course, the new episodes will referrence the old ones...right????"
3,Great TV?,"Season 1 of Lost is without a doubt one of the best shows to have ever aired on network TV. The writers and producers along with great acting did succeed in putting a fablous TV program together. Okay all you readers, I was absolutly wrong in my earlier review of Lost season 2. Believe me I am hooked more than ever on this show. As for this seasons repeats I now see why they are being aired again. There is a thread. A reason. The writers of Lost are absolutely brilliant. Will I buy Season 2 of Lost. You can bet the bank! I'll watch repeats on VHS until then and also try to figure out who goes first. James Ford aka Sanders the con artist whos been conning the other surviors or Jack who for now finds himself being told what to do. There is one thing for certain, ""Things are going to heat up and the close to death wound to Sanders by Saied last season was not anything."
5,LOST mania,"I am not much of a TV show person, that being said, I LOVE LOST. The characters are intrieging, the plot line is weird enough to catch your attention and you WANT to find out whats going to happen. Its fantastic. The acting is phenominal and I am totally hooked. If you get this you will watch it again and again to catch stuff you might have missed. Heck... lend it to family or friends. A must get for everyone!!!!!!"
5,I got hooked on 'Lost'!!,"First, I feel this show will be around for a few seasons because there are so many hooks and questions introduced in the first 4 shows alone! Actually, I happened to catch the 3rd show from the last episode of season 1 in reruns and I was sucked into the plots in that one show alone! I then heard the 1st season was available on DVD. There was no question about it - I had to buy it to get caught up. One might think that 'How long can a show go on with 40+ people crashed on a island'? Well this has to be one of the best written shows I have ever watched. I have watch the Season 1 set twice since I bought it. My 25 year old son has become as big a fan as myself and has borrowed them twice himself to watch. You will not be disappointed! For those already fans, this is a MUST HAVE for your DVD library."
3,Good DVD of the first series,"The first series of lost was excellent, went a bit weird and downhill for me afterwards, but this is a fine example of how to start a US series, pity they couldn't keep up the high standard for later series."
5,"i love it, i love it.","It is indeed a cruel mix of Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Dino Crisis and a lil bit of soap opera altogether in one thrilling show.I have noticed a lot, the fact that they used multiracial people to be in this show, allows a lot of other races to be interested in watching it, and thats such creative genius!I love Naveen Andrews!!! Since I saw him in Mira Nair's Kama Sutra I always have loved him, but now everybody else can see his acting prowess as well as his chiseled abs! Maggie Grace is also very beautiful. Emilie de Ravin, who plays Claire, is not only beautiful, she can actually act!I used to think this show was just plain weird. Now I am hooked on the season 1 box seat and I am too embarassed to admit I only have been watching it 2 days ago!!! Dont take my word for it, though!Yoon Jin Kim, who plays Sun, gives great performance as well."
5,LOST - The First Season DVD,"This DVD set was wonderful to watch. It is one of my favorite series. We had missed some episodes when they were aired on television and it was great to watch each episode in order, and fill in the blanks. The characters were well developed and very interesting and most are very good looking too. The acting is well done and the screenplays are excellent. I am eagerly waiting for the LOST Year two DVD set."
5,Great DVD set with Great bonus disc material,"If you have never seen this tv series before or have not seen the complete series, this would be a great collection to have. It is quite possibly the best series on television right now... not to mention the most addictive.If you are a big fan, then you will difinately enjoy the bonus features included on a separate disc. It has great behind the scenes stuff. And of course, this show looks so cinematic and sharp on DVD. Sometimes I forget I'm watching a TV show and not a movie. All in all it's definately worth it to get this on DVD."
3,Each episode gets worse,"I have watched all of season 1, and started on season 2. The series gradually gets dumber and dumber as it tries to keep things interesting. So more contrived conflicts and just plain outlandish events. The series isn't just about what happens on the island, but also what happened to the characters before the island, as shown through flashbacks. The show is 50% island and 50% flashbacks. Now what has really got old for me is that the flashbacks are getting more and more pointless, and a waste of time, because they keep covering the same stuff with a little more exposition. Very little happens on the island during one episode. Season 1 was entertaining enough, but as I get 4 episodes into season 2, it's simply not worth the time, and I find myself fast forwarding over more and more."
5,Lost Season 1,"The show itself is amazing, extremely captivating and mysterious. Character development is the likes of which no television show has ever offered. The cliff hangers will have you begging for the answer and the show will never quite give you the full answer but instead let your mind wander through the many elaborate possibilities. Not only is the show itself great, but the DVDs have a lot of extra features. From cast and director commentaries to behind the scenes interviews and more."
5,Lost and Found,"I was able to regain the excitement of the first season by watching it all over again on this 7 disc DVD collection. It gives you in depth character backgrounds, and puts you back into the begining of our favorite LOST characters before storylines and DUI's get the better of them."
5,Great television,"After being drawn into this show from the very beginning. I had various expectations. Most of those expectations weren't fulfilled. But, in a way, that's okay. I learned to love this show throughout the season. The hidden mysteries that reveal themselves over time are brilliant. What is the meaning of the Island? What do the numbers mean? What's in the bunker? What is the nature of the beast?Hypothesizing about these mysteries is just one of the great things about LOST. Good television is credited with many outside conversations. LOST is pure watercooler television. Few shows build discussion like this one.In the middle of the season, LOST hits a somewhat slow period. But the back story built in the middle episode ends up serving a greater purpose. I was drawn into the characters like I never thought I could.I welcome a second viewing of LOST any day. This DVD set should do good to hold the many LOST, like me, until a second season."
5,A must watch,"Lost is probably one of the best show I have watched in a long time. I am one of those people that watch tons of shows. I have watched shows where there is a group of people and they are the only people left, but Lost just brings something unique to the table. Ever episodes builds up to one of a kind conclusion. I feel that everybody should watch Lost."
5,Lost review,"Everything went great. Very efficient, arrived on time and just as things should go. Very pleased and happy with the transaction."
5,Must............have........................Lost............,This is a must-have DVD.I can't wait to see all my favorite episodes of this must-see show.
5,Best Sci-fi Drama ever made,This show has been a huge hit. Of course it appeals to alot of people. It has enough Sci-fi and action to keep the guys interested and fantastic acting and drama for the ladies. Not to mention some serious eye candy for both genders to enjoy. If you want to see what all the noise is about you will easily get hooked on this show. Season 1 didnt seem to give you alot of information but there are more answers to come in the next seasons.
1,Don't waste your time on this series!,The final season was a waste. After the finale you'll be scratching your headed wondering why you wasted so many hours of your life with this series.
1,Is anything going to HAPPEN in this show?,"I watched the first season all the way through with the hopes that it was actually GOING somewhere, and now I realize that it is not, nor from hearing about the other seasons does it seem to be going anywhere at all. Maybe they will release an abridged version of this show at some point that puts everything interesting in the first 24 episodes into 6 or 7 episodes and doesn't waste my time.THANK GOD I DOWNLOADED THIS SHOW INSTEAD OF BUYING IT!!!I can't believe everyone is being played so easily! There's only so far that you can go with endless mysteries and fake tension before I get fed up. 24 episodes to open a metal hatch . . ."
5,the best,lost is the best program you will watch on television this year i love it and block some of nmy friends on msn so they dont ruin the plot it is very well written and full of plot twists and turns my favourite programme ever and it rocks
5,By far the best on TV,"I'm just speechless. I don't know how I can explain how good this series is. The plot, the acting and the directors are great. I can't wait for season 2. IT IS A MUST SEE.It has suspense, romance, action ... etc. It has everything. It is even educational.I got so hooked. I finished the DVD in 10 days or so which means 2 to 3 per day."
3,meh.,"It's cute, I guess, in a poodly kind of way, but the software is incompatible with macs, and I didn't see mention of that, or the fact that you need a USB cable which is very much un-included.The children, they seemed to like it for about an hour, before they tired of the dog calling them ""Friend"" and referring to itself as ""Puppy"". Me, I cursed the thing first as I unwound and gnawed through those little wires and plastic, again when I realised the software was useless, and once again as I rummaged through my junk closet looking for a stupid cable that would fit."
1,Noobs keyboard,"Besides the akward key placemnets that other reviews pointed out I would add that the existing encryption for the keyboard is 64 bit. This static 64 bit key can be broken in minutes. There is even security advisory about this. Once key is broken everybody can see what you are typing in.At the bottom of the keyboard there are butterfly flaps that let you raise the keyboard. These flaps open to the right and left ( / \ ). This one is no brainer. Everytime you move keyboard left or right one of these flaps closes and the keyboard colapses(yes, there is no way to lock the flaps).- No cap clock indicator on the keyboard.I did get it working in Unix (just for fun) with USB and PS2. However there is NO encryption support for Unix so I'm not sure why would you want to use it.I would NOT recomend that you get this keyboard. Its basic hardware design flaws, odd keyboard layout, and lack of security deserves only one star."
5,"This album is the key to happiness. April, please make more!","When I listen to this record, I can't help singing along and dancing and feeling great. April's voice is lovely. The selections are tasty. The interpretation is inventive and refreshing. I just keep hitting REPLAY!"
3,Positive but light on the technical side,"This is a biography of an exuberant and accomplished engineer who charmed many, including the biographer. Ward makes the strongest case yet for accentuating the positive in examining the life of Dr. von Braun, but still falls short of a balanced examination of the rocket scientist's wartime career. The major limitation of the book is the sketchy, at times almost non-existent, discussion of the technical details of developing the V-2 and the later US missiles and space launchers. (Compare this to ""Rocket and the Reich"" for instance.) Ward reports many positive comments by other engineers about von Braun's engineering skills, but hardly any examples are described. Overall, recommended, especially for space and military collections, but not the definitive work."
5,Great Book,I loved this book. After I finished it I bought additional copies for all my married children.
4,Review: Triumph: The Power and the Glory of the Catholic Church,This book is a very good review of the early church and is written for the layman rather than the religious scholar. Recommended reading for those who may want to trace the happenings in the early church.
3,A Man's Book?,"While I enjoyed the writing style of the author, I would have to say that this is definitely a book written by a man for men. At least, the emphasis on war seemed a bit excessive. Were saints mentioned? Yes. But by far the author emphasised the battle between world leaders, fights over land and terriroty, wars, political intigue, etc. Is that part of the Church's history? Yes. The most beneficial aspect of the book was that I was able to recognize almost every event and person mentioned reassuring me that I'm not as ignorant of history as I assumed."
2,disappointing,"the book began with an even handed introduction to the Church until the beginning of the reformation era. at that point the author began to use words like 'toadies' 'fissiparous' and other value laden phrases that detracted from the subject matter. i had expected a clear exposition of the history of the Church, not a polemic against protestantism and its progeny. for the record i am a committed Catholic."
4,Guide for sacristans,This book has helped me as a sacristan. Very informative. Very easy to read and understand.
2,Strike one.,"I applied it, and the mirror stayed for a couple of days. Then it fell off. I give it two stars instead of one, because I may have moved it a bit, only a bit in the installation."
4,My son liked it allot!,"It was fine, no real issue. My son really enjoyed it a lot. I would buy more other various versions of this again."
2,Shut the Box,"The box is VERY SMALL. It doesn't give you much room to roll the dice very well. Disappointed in the size, my grandson has a Shut the Box, but much larger."
3,Box looked bigger on web site. Disappointed in size of box,The box is fine. The problem is it was not as big as it looked on the web. It is smaller than I expected and I was disappointed. I would have a bigger box.
2,not sure the book has the right conclusions,"the author claims that there's no device which measures an imaginary number; well, for EE's, an imaginary number (phasor) can be measured with an oscilloscope since oscilloscopes can measure amplitude and phase; this representation can then be converted to an imaginary number. the author also claims that you can't have -5 apples in a box and this seems sinister since -5, for example, would mean that there's an IOU in the box after the vender had 5 apples and bartered 10 apples for something he wanted. in this case, when the vender got a dozen more apples, 5 of them would be owed. perhaps I should read more than amazon's sample pages but the ones I read didn't seem that complete."
2,Rosana's first was much better,"I have both Rosana's Cd's and think that her second , lunas nuevas was a far cry from her Lunas Rotas. The music and even the title of her second Cd suggests a lack of thought. sorry, but I am very disappointed in this Cd"
2,very disappointed,"we bought this toy for are 3 year old, well very disappointed. The car wash is junk the ramp is hard to move up and down. I can't see how they expect a 3 year old to move it when I have trouble moving it. Will be returning to the store. The only good thing about it is the tow truck and the extra car with hood that opens."
2,Mom of 3 boys,"This toy was mainly bought so we could have more vehicles for the big garage, but the last reviewer was right, this toy is pretty junky. I expected more from this toy especially because it is Fisher Price. They love the Little People videos, they watch them over and over again, all day long. The car wash part of this toy is pretty lame overall, but my 7 month old likes to chew on it so at least it gets some use."
3,CHOKING HAZARD-----keep your eyes on this one!,"We bought this to enhance my son's ""ramps around garage."" My son, a 22-month-old, plays fairly gently with his toys. Last week, as he was playing with this, the yellow ""gas"" hose that attaches to the toy broke right off. It broke into two separate pieces, one about an inch, the other about 2 inches....definite choking hazards! My son was confused about what happened, so he brought the pieces to me. Luckily, he didn't stick them in his mouth. I contacted the company, and there are not any recalls or replacement parts for this item. I don't think I would recommend this toy, but if you do have it in your home, I would strongly recommend sitting right by your toddler whenever he or she is playing with it! I was only a few feet away, but he still could have tried to swallow the pieces!"
2,Theres no way this is pac,"This is pac? u guys have to be kidding me. Pacs raps r much deeper than Blac Haze and Pacs voice is also deeper, and doesnt rap as fast. And for Blac Haze, I thought his songs sucked. He sounds like a copycat and I dont lke him. I mean, to name hes album Res-Sa-Rec-Shun, so ppl think hes Pac is a screwed up thing to do, and if ppl believe the hype that he is Pac that makes them stupid. As for the Album, all the songs sound the same to me, and the style of rap sounds like ive heard it a million times before. Blac Haze if your reading this, BE ORIGINAL."
3,Not Flush to Tank,"I bought this to divide my ten gallon betta tank. I installed it according to the directions, but it wasn't flush to the tank so within minutes one of my little guys was able to slide through to visit his neighbor (fortunately, I was able to separate them quickly). I bought some aquarium sealant and black filter cartridge and glued the dividers to the tank and glued some fliter on each side for added security."
2,Doesn't work well,Plastic was so bent that couldn't get divider to serve its purpose. Divider is kind of loose too. Not recommended for live bearer fish. Fry always escaped and got eaten by bigger fish.
5,Great Listening,"This is a fantastic two cd album of compilations from fourteen of Michael Feinstein's albums. Disc One has twenty two selections and Disc Two has twenty one,with duets with Rosemary Clooney,Page Cavanaugh and Liza Minelli. There are fourteen previously unissued selectiions.Also included in the package is a 50 page booklet with pictures of Michael and a wonderful interview conducted by George Feltenstein of Rhino Records,who also happens to be one of Michael's best friends. This is a great addition to this collection.Since Michael helped select the songs played here it is quite a representation of the many facets of his talent. This album will please all those who love his music."
2,disappointed fan,"I expected a CD that was mainly Feinstein singing with an orchestra.It was,however mainly the singer with piano singing what I call Dities that reminded me of the English music hall dities of the 1920's-40's that Noel Coward sang. I never associated Feinstein with that type of song.He does very well with selections from the great American Songbook."
4,Very good!!,"Imagine that you put 2 spoons of Sonic Youth, 2 spoons of Cardigans and a little bit of metal, put it on the mixer, turn it on to med. speed and..Voila!! you have Royal-My dear, this album is really cool, the sound is, in most of the songs, increscendo type, wich is the best point of the C.D. they change from a Hard Rock Sound to a 60's sound and it sounds amazing, then why am I giving 4 stars?? simple, the voice..this girl sings pretty nice, but she needs more volume in her vocals, besides of this, the album is a very cool Debut Album, be sure that the next will be better!!!"
2,Not as good as I thought,"Because computers in the school curriculum is becoming more popular, I took a look at this book. Its description was good but I found the book to be painfully basic and not practically useful for any grade level. It's fine, if perhaps you have no idea about computers in general and just need a definition of what ""technology integration"" is. It's definitely not worth the price."
2,Mediocre,"Although the authors are clearly competent, there's not much here. Most of the material is not specific to library writing, but rather generic C++ advice, and not all that well done. Many points lack proper explanation. Examples are contrived. Read Scott Meyers instead."
1,Not worth the money,"I got this doll for my 6yr old daughter for Christmas. She wanted a baby that cried & wet it's diaper. It does wet it's diaper, but you have to hold it just right when you SQUEEZE the water in it's mouth or it just spills out. I haven't even tried to mess with the food since the water is not easy to get down it. Then in order to get it to cry, you have to squeeze the arm SOOO hard that my daughter can't even get it to work. I barely can. I guess the educational part of that is if you squeeze a REAL baby's arm that hard, yes it will cry!! The other arm you squeeze to make it ""squeak"" again, too hard to squeeze. The only bonus I see to this doll is that you can take it in the bath wich my daughter does. She doesn't really play with it otherwise, so it was an expensive bath toy. If it had not been for the fact that it came from ""Santa"" I would have promptly returned it & let her select another doll. VERY DISAPOINTED!"
4,I want this doll !!!,I am 12 years old and it kinda seems wierd but I want a Baby Born Doll. From the bad reviews I think they are wrong!! My best friend has one and she says the are sooooo cute and when I had a baby born when I was 7 it did NOT pee everywhere..If you are my age or older and you like baby dolls you should get this one!!!
2,This doll needs design work,"Sorry--just don't think this doll is worth it. I bought this for my 4yr. old who wanted a doll for tub, feeding and potty. The doll must be positioned just right to do any of the functions and is, in general, awkward to use and clean. Since there are resevoirs in the doll you must clean it out after it has been in tub or pool. If the doll is for a younger child there is definitely maintenance required on the parents' part. Because of the functionality rules, I find myself feeding and changinging the doll more than my daughter. Yes, I like playing with my daughter but the idea with a doll is for the child to be the ""mommy""or ""daddy."" Maybe this is best for a child over 6 or 7?"
4,Marooned on Mars,"From the back cover: ""Determined to be on the first rocket flight from the moon to Mars, stowaway Chuck Svensen endangers the experiment by hiding on board the Eros.""Fast moving adventure narrative that is similar to Heinlein's ""juvenile"" novels in style and content. Like those novels, this one could be enjoyed by adults or children."
3,cinematography excellent,"Yes... the movie itself is slow and the plot is fairly flat. While I am a big fan of Sylvia Plath's and looked forward to seeing an interpretation of her life on screen, I don't believe this version gave it justice.On that note, the cinematography and art direction was absolutely gorgeous. The coloring and framing of each shot was well thought out and obviously very intentional. It's the art aspect of this movie that drew me in along with Paltrow's performance."
3,A disappointment,"While Gwyneth Paltrow does turn in an accomplished performance as Sylvia Plath, ""Sylvia"" is a mediocre viewing experience and gives us little to chew on before the inevitable conclusion. The film takes a predictable path in detailing Plath's and Ted Hughes' turbulent romance. There is little mention of Plath's poetry, with the exception of Paltrow reading a few lines here and there. The Bell Jar is mentioned only once. As another reviewer commented, her motives and influences for writing are not made a focal point of the movie and in fact are hardly touched upon at all. It should have been called ""Sylvia and Ted."" It just seemed this movie could have been much more, and so I guess I was bound to be disappointed."
2,"""Her own words describe her best.""","Having recently finished ""Ariel: The Restored Edition"" and ""Her Husband, Ted Hughes & Sylvia Plath: A Marriage"", I thought I would finish off my Plath rampage with this movie. I was very disappointed. The movie was long, stuck to details of her life that probably didn't help move along the plot of the movie, and extremely melodramatic. I was dismayed and even a little embarrassedSylviaafter finishing. In her introduction to ""Ariel: The Restored Edition,"" Frieda Hughes says, ""My mother's poems cannot be crammed into the mouths of actors in any filmic reinvention of her story in the expectation that they can breathe life into her again."" I would say this film did a terrible job at attempting to ""breathe life into her again,"" and ruined the image of Sylvia Plath for those whose only impression of her is this film. I full heartedly agree with Frieda, ""Her own words describe her best."""
3,Mostly Suited For True Plath Fans,"Some excellent camera work and unusual visual angles highlighted by skilled use of lighting marked this dreary, crawling film's real achievement. Based on the marriage of the late poets Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes, this movie does admirably achieve the telling of its story without placing undue blame or taking sides in a partisan way. The trouble is, its wending pace fails to hold the attention. Basically this movie is simply not that good, and considering its subject matter and the people involved, it should have been."
1,This must be free,"I bought this item for a personal business, believing I could create a simple but professional logo. Forget about it. Just a few templates, circles and brushes. On the net I found better tools for free!. They have an expansion set, but after my experience I tend to believe it will not work. The company must care about its client, and sell a pack consisting of the Logo Creator, the expansion pack, the font pack and else."
3,Too leading,"1. This cd had potential, but failed to go to the maximum. 2. The songs led you on to be a great composition, and yet only were a minute or so long. 3. I was very disapointed, because I loved the movie"
5,Heavenly reading,Randy Alcorn has presented his findings in a clear and concise manner and documented his source of information (the Bible) and confirmation from other authors. I would recommend this book to anyone with the least or most interest in Heaven. God bless all who read it.
5,Best Travel Itinerary!,"Alcorn has done a great job in studying the Bible for all the information concerning Heaven. He has put it all together and made it easier to understand. Jesus Christ spoke more about Hell than He did about Heaven because it was Hell He wanted us to avoid at all costs. This book has given me a calmer view of my life and death to come. It has also reminded me how important it is to share it with as many people as possible. If you've already read this book, then you know that it would make a comforting gift to someone that has lost a loved one to death or a person will a terrible illness or someone that needs to know Jesus Christ. Don't miss out and use your highlighter. You will have favorite parts that you will want/need to review."
4,fresh interpretation,"Randy Alcorn has opened up a whole new interpretation of what heaven and the new heaven is and will be and he is Biblical. After my experiencing being a Christian for over 50 years, this is fantastic reading."
5,Truly a comforting read and most helpful with grief ...,"This book was recommended to me during the weeks following the devastating loss of my husband. As a result of my clinging to the comforting words that I read in Randy Alcorn's HEAVEN book, I have come to purchase as many as sixteen copies - to help others who were grieving or ones who were soon to face losing their ailing loved ones. All of us are most appreciative for a book based in the scripture and so thoroughly researched regarding heaven and eternity - therefore, a book that is both informative and comforting."
2,A Very Subjective Devotional,"I just finished teaching this in a pastoral Bible Study-and it left me with some disappointment. The book does make several good points supported by scripture, but they could literally be reduced to a pamphlet. The remainder of the book is speculation and over-use of quotes and examples from C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien.The book is good as a sermon-starter or to provide a decent example to meditate upon, so it's not without value. It's just very weak in the scriptural context, and I would estimate a full seventy-five percent fluff and the private unsubstantiated ""if-then"" speculations of Alcorn. There's nothing un-scriptural or that I find incorrect in the book, it's simply a very subjective, ""this is what I believe and you should too"" kind of work."
5,The things I'm learning....,"WOW...this book is opening my eyes a bit more each day. Our Sunday School class is studying this book right now. With each page I read, my excitement for Heaven grows. Heaven is a real place just like I'm a real person. I look forward to seeing those who have gone before me. I'm also sad because I know that everyone will be there. We all have to make a choice and no one can make it for us."
2,"Back to the ""drawing board"" with this one","I'm sorry I became so disenchanted with this book so early on in my reading of it--so much so, in fact, that I must confess that I did not finish it. Perhaps Alcorn is an authority on the subject--albeit a self-proclaimed one--but I simply found his concept of heaven too far out to do proper justice to the subject. Besides, who among us can write a definitive study of the subject? I do not recommend this book to anyone. I think Mr. Alcorn needs to revise his concept of mankind's eternal home and then, if he simply must do so, approach his subject from an entirely different perspective. But I will say that I admire the time and effort that went into the writing of this book."
2,heaven,"I don't think there were enough scriptures to back up the idea of an intermediate heaven. Too much, may be and I think it might be this way or that."
5,A profound book that made me long for my coming home.,"Randy Alcorn is an outstanding writer. He knows how to capture the heart and the mind. The subject of this book, Heaven, is interesting enough but Alcorn has gone beyond and stimulate my interest. I recommend all his writings."
1,Heaven Bound,"I loved this book! It is the very best book I have ever read on Heaven!It lines up with the scriptures, which I looked up as I read the book.Heaven is presented in such an exciting and real way, I can hardly wait to get there! I rate this book 5 stars, but I can't seem to get it corrected."
5,Too much fun,I love this book. I didn't sleep well for 2 weeks after first reading it. I would lay in bed late at night and ponder Heaven.A great work on Heaven. I still treat myself to this book once every few weeks for a little catching up.
2,A bit too wandering on the subject,"Finished ""Heaven"" by Randy Alcorn. Started out good. Alcorn forgoes the ""Heaven is better than we could ever imagine"" and gets down to the brass tax of what the Bible says about it. However, I think he deals with surrounding issues a little too much to pad the book. Overall, not a bad book, but I would have liked to see a better organized and more straight forward approach on the subject. When you're title is so straightforward, your book should be too. Final grade - D+"
2,More broad interpretations of Scripture and speculation,"From Chapter 6: ""My concern was not so much that he believed the intermediate Heaven isn't physical (Maybe he's right)""...""We shouldn't find it surprising""...""It seems reasonable""...""It makes sense""...THAT is the tone of Alcorn's book. If you want yet another scholarly fantasy that attempts to balance Scripture with ""what ifs,"" this is the book for you. ""Will there be seasons on the New Earth? Why wouldn't there be?"" There's a danger in placing too much confidence in books like this. If it gives you comfort, great. Alcorn had 500 pages to fill, and he does so with ruminations on Scripture that might be accurate and might not be, plus a LOT of opinion. I prefer to stick with the Bible."
5,He has set eternity in their hearts...,"This book has been changing my life! I have been recommending it and buying it for so many of my friends. One of my favorite lines says, ""for Christians this is the closest they will ever get to hell, but for unbelievers this is the closest they will ever get to heaven."" If that doesn't stir your heart, I don't know what will. This life seems so bittersweet, with each good thing there are often hard decisions, sacrifice, and difficulty that accompany it. Every Christian is in the posture of waiting, but heaven is the place of no more longings, because all longings are fulfilled in Christ. It is about time a book comes along that helps us actually understand and grow in our anticipation of eternity."
5,Ever wonder about Heaven?,"This is a marvelous book! The author has thoroughly researched Bible content, and has come up with an incredible amount of information about the place we all want to go after this life is over. I highly recommend this to anyone who has unanswered questions about Our Heavenly Abode!"
5,Hitting home...,"Dad, Loved the book. So did all my friends down here in Texas. Someday, Olivia will love her chapter - when she learns to read! Can't wait for the next book to hear more ""letters from home.""Congrats, Bros"
2,not the same british blues guy,"""I got the blues for christmas"",is not done by the british blues master Peter Green,this cd is done by an american,with the same name,from new york"
2,disappointing,"The audio portion is OK, but the video is of very poor quality.A lot of noise. Not a professional product at all. Very disappointing."
3,Great Show but defective product,"I felt frustrated after buying this DVD for the first time. The DVD gets stuck or it just freezes up when the second act begins. I exchanged this product twice at Circuit City. I don't know if this is a production issue or if it's just the inventory received by the store I went to that is defective. I don't know if other people have experienced this. I guess I'll try again but this time buying it from Amazon.However, the show itself is stunning. I am not a Sarah Brightman's fan, but I have to recognize that she really shines on this one. Just get it...beware of the possible defect though..."
1,sometimes you get what you pay for,push button igniter is really cheap and pooly made. Save time and spend the few extra dollars to buy one a Lowe's.
3,Nice book,"Contains its fair share of legal info regarding anabolic steroids. Not all info is accurate, but most is fairly reliable."
1,Not So Much,"I received this pan as a gift and was impressed by the Cuisinart name. They have engineered this pan down to the thinnest possible use of metal. While the flat bottom is a tri-layer of stainless with aluminum core, the sides are thin, single ply with little heat conductivity. The instructions caution against the use of a flame above medium except for boiling water; but the pan will not sear and caramelize food quickly at these temperatures. So it isn't a wok experience. As for boiling water, it is not efficient for boiling water unless in small quantities. The lid is heavier than the pan; I can hang the pan on a hook; but in my kitchen, am at a loss for a good place to store the 14"" lid conveniently. Don't buy because you can't go wrong at this price; you can. (10 years professional experience in culinary)"
1,do not buy it,I felt disappointed about this product. I don't think it is made of stainless steel. You will see a lot of grey spots on the bottom of the pan after the very first usage (boiling water). and it should not be this way for a stainless pan. do not buy it.
3,Not for Induction cooktops,I wish I had more carefully read the small print for this pan. I missed the part about the encapsulated aluminum in the base of the pan. It would not heat on our induction cooktop which requires pans to be cast iron or stainless steel only. I think it would be great for other cooktops. Cost me the shipping to return the item.
2,Haven't yet figured out what to use it for.,"I bought this stir fry pan to help with cooking Chinese cuisine, have used it to cook, deep fry and stir fry but not impressed with any of it. Deep fry and stir fry foods always stick and leave burnt food marks on the bottom of pan that are hard to clean. Cooking items takes so long since it is not recommended to cook items on high, low - medium heat for best cooking results. Was looking for a wok, this is definitely not the product that I was looking for. There are actually two things that I am disappointed about one- is the name brand, usually stands for good product, huge disappointment here. Also, there was a big bend in the rim when I received it, as if these are mark off items being sold as ""new"". New items should not have this type of blemish."
3,It's ok,"This one pots unfornately did come with a ping around the edges, but it is large and heavy, I love it so I decided on keeping it."
1,More Time Spent Showing People & Equipment Than Marine Life,"This was a terrible movie. They spent more time showing the scientists reacting to marine life (such intelligent comment such as ""awesome!"") than the marine life itself. The director should have realized that viewers aren't watching the movie to look at the scientists or watch the scientists photograph each other in their vehicles - we want to look at the marine life. If they had just done a short segment showing what equipment they were using and then showed only the marine life with narration describing what we were seeing it would have been decent. This was just irritating and terrible."
5,Motorcraft PS131 Fuel Tank Sender,worked perfect and I got the genuinie FORD part at about half the price any dealer was selling it for.
2,Letdown,"I really like all of the Earth Crisis work from All Out War through the Gomorrah's Season era, but I thought this album was a real let down. To me, both lyrically and musically this album comes across as very weak compared to their earlier releases."
3,Fun But So Noisy,"We own a half dozen of these Little People toy sets. This one has to be the noisest one of them all. It is obnoxious. Also, you really have to press hard on the little person to get the dumper to release all the way down. Adults who use it even have a hard time. But my son likes it and I'm sure he will have many hours of fun annoying me while playing with it."
3,sound quality not so great,"i liked the size and price of this product, however once i received it it was not even close to the quality i expected. we have the JBL creature speakers for our mini and the quality of those are much better. we are going with the JBL on stage with the RF remote instead"
2,"Nice design, poor sound quality","I bought these speakers on sale at 50% off ($75) and regret I did. They were to be an upgrade to my Altec Lansing inMotion speakers for iPod. In a side-by-side comparasin, the inMotion speakers are clearly superior (although half the size). In particular, the bass on the Kensington sounds muddy. They lack sound clarity and separation. If your top concern is for rugged speakers with a sleek design and iPod ready, you may want to consider these. If sound quality is a priority, I would recommend against the kensington. Its no surprise to me to see how far the price has dropped."
5,Ipod nano speaker,"I bought this for my teenage son & he is very happy with the sound,style,convenience,& charging ability. It also can be usedw/ diff. ipods, etc. Great for the price."
4,ease of use & flexibility,"I love this device. Simply put, it frees your music via ease of use & flexibility. It simplifies music: no fuss, no rebooting, no networking issues, no scratched cd's, etc...You should know these 2 items:No remoteNo bass and luke warm treble: the sound quality is a bit better then an radio alarm clock. Although I have $ thousands $ of high end audio equip, I prefer to listen to my iPod 8G Nano with this Kensington iPod SoundDoc."
1,QuickBooks compatibility,This product claims compatibility with QB but doesn't deliver. QB will not export data in a format acceptable to Checksoft; Checksoft will not import data from QB. Tech support is a joke ... $25 for first 10 minutes ... forget it. I spent too many hours this week trying to get this to work and it just isn't worth it.
3,Good Beginner set,"This set is good for a beginner, but wouldn't be suited for an experienced whittler. The box is nice, but not all the blades and files fit in it exactly snug."
4,Gorilla Alarm,"Nice unit, easy to configure. Bracket did NOT fit the alarm unit correctly. Had to ""rig"" it myself to install it correctly, but works fine."
1,Extremely poop,"This is not, in my opinion, entertainment. I found it grating and painful although that was partly my own fault for not having the good sense to turn it off. The content is essentially a pointless portrait of abuse, self-involvement, and disrespect. And... the guy was down a well? There was no contact, she just assumed he was in Sweden? None of his things were gone, his car, his keys, his clothes? That makes no sense, it's just lazy and stupid. Just extremely poor. Actually, I typed 'poop' there, before 'correcting' it, but it was more correct to begin with. Oh well, I used it in the title."
4,Pleasant Diversion,The movie wasn't what I thought it would be but was very enjoyable just the same. The acting was top notch and makes this film a viewing pleasure
4,Mike Binder's Best Movie yet.,"Mike Binder wrote, directed and is a suport actor in this fun movie about anger. It stars Joan Allen and Kevin Costner. The entire ensemble cast of this movie were great in making this movie flow.The movie follows the journey of a wife and mother whose husband unexpectedly disappears and leaves them alone. Now the family has to learn to deal with the anger of his not being there. The family has four daughters and they need to juggle their mom's romantic dilemmas and family dynamics that continually change. Kevin Costner plays a former baseball player, now radio DJ, who starts to fall for the family.The true story of the movie is about anger. How it can stop and change your life if you let it. And even though the female lead is angry, she is dealing with a tough time in her life. But most of all the movie shows that anger is a waste of time and that you should not make assumptions. Always check your facts first."
5,One of the Best Movies I've Seen in a Long Time,"From beginning to end this is a great movie. The actors were very well cast for their parts. Joan Allen does an amazing job in playing up all of the emotions that her character goes through. Kevin Costner plays a great drunk, former ball player radio personality who befriends a lonely Joan. The parts of Joan's daughters, played by Keri Russell, Ericka Christensen, Evan Rachel Wood, and Alicia Witt, were so well done. Even Ericka's younger brother, Dane, has a part in this film. Mike Binder did an amazing job writing, directing, and appearing in this film.This is a film that will really make you think about your own life and I had to watch it for a second time to fully understand what the title really meant. I won't give it away for those who have yet to see it.All in all, I highly recommend this film to anyone. Oh, and I am going out the day it is released and buying at least 10 copies for me and my friends."
3,touching!,"I just now saw this movie and was totaly impressed by it. The acting is superb. The movie made my cry, laugh, smile...The downside is that there are parts of the storyline I didn't understand,...like how much time had passed between certain scenes, and how the Joan Allen charecter didn't know about her husband... but all in all, good movie! Especualy since I was only going to see it b/c of Evan Rachel Wood...she's not in every scene and I was concerned, beforehand, that I might be bored without her in scenes..."
1,No Upside to this Movie,"This movie was horrible. My sister rented it, and, bless her heart, she had faith that at some point it would have some highlights. There were no highlights, save one brief moment in a fantasy scene where a character's head blows up. It would have been a better movie if all the character's heads blew up.When people crawl into a bottle because things get tough, it's not cute or funny. This film might have a place at AA meetings to illustrate how ugly alcoholism is."
2,Unpleasant People,"Screaming skull anorexic lollipop-head drunk bitch Joan Allen and fat slob drunk dufus Kevin Costner argue for two hours while Allen's spoiled daughters carry on with various dopey/stoned/pervert boyfriends. There are about three tediously long scenes where all the characters laugh, and laugh, and laugh. If only I could have found this lame story one-tenth as amusing as they did. And after all that, there's a preposterous twist ending worthy of ""Murder, She Wrote."" The one thing I can be thankful for is that, in spite of two shower scenes and a sex scene, we are spared seeing Allen's skeletal body naked. Joan--for God's sake, eat something. Smoking is not a substitute for food!"
4,Upside of Good,In the movie a woman is abandon by her husband who has apparently ran off with his mistress and leaving her with their four daughter. Joan Allen is very good at playing the mainpulative mother as she trys to hold on to her daughters and keep them from growing up. When she mets Costner's character she is suprised to find herself falling in love again. The endig will send you through a loop though. I gave it 4 stars mainly because the plot was alittle hard to follow and keep up with.
3,Cute book,"The book is adorable. I saw it at a market and they wanted an obscene amount of money for it so I was thrilled to find it on amazon for a fraction of the price. It arrived in a timely manner, but there were a few tears in the book. This is a problem because the novelty of the book are the tags that make pieces move in the book, but when those pieces are torn, it doesn't work. It was a matter of some crazy glue and it's all good but I didn't expect that because the seller said that it was in good condition."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!!,"I saw a lot of bad review about this crappy item, but like a silly guy I bought it! Be aware that it may be an nonreturnable item. If you were me, don't spend your money on this pick! Buy a real chorus gear."
3,Not a favorite toy at our house,"Since we have the big barn, this little one gets pushed aside most of the time. The barn doors are easy to pull off and have been lost already. The water pump is cute but doesn't really hold their interest for long. In short, this play set is buried in the bottom of the toy box. The video, on the other hand, is a hit. Little People videos really get my kids' attention and they're the sort of happy little movies you'd want your kids to be watching."
3,bad sound distribution,The problem appears with the male voices ... and in the Santus the lovable andunique solo of the violin is not audible ... lost into the orchesta ! ...Non sense.
3,OK but not the best Mountain Goats' album,"I am a complete fan of John Darnielle, but I have not so far got into this album. If you are just starting to collect the Mourtain Goats' wonderful repertoire, I would start with 'The Sunset Tree', 'Babylon Springs' 'Get Lonely' and 'We shall all be healed' (and don't forget 'All hail west texas"". John Darnielle is a unique talent and if you ever get the chance to see him live, do not miss it.Darnielle has become one of the most remarkable writers in pop music and his musical talents are equal to his lyrics."
3,How do i put on the crystals without bending,"I bought this candelabra to go on my dining room table, it's not as elegant as i would like it, but I have another use for it. Is there anyone that brought this item and can you share with me how to put the crystal on the labra without bending the wires out of shape? This candelabra worth $69 dollars at the most. I'm not all that happy with it cheaply made part move around it's arms are connected with plastis disk you side the 4 arms into and attack to the base which does not really secure in place."
3,just ok,You've probably heard these songs before if you're familiar with contemeporary christian pop and hymns. The lyrics are not anything deep on any of these songs. All the songs are sung by females except for one. I guess if you like new age celtic music you will enjoy this. There just isn't anything new and nothing too deep.
3,"looks great, but is quite short","I ordered this product to wear as a replacement for my old highly damaging metal labret horseshoe. When I opened the envelope I noticed that this body ring is much shorter than i am use to seeing for sale. Even with one bead exchanged out for a smaller ball this ring doesn't clear the top of my lower lip. I am not mad though. the bioplast already feels much nicer against my teeth and gums. the best part is that the ring is flexible and doesn't create much pressure on my lip. I am giving this a rating of 3 stars, the lost stars are for the shortness."
1,If you want to carve wood buy something else,"I bought these for a print making class, used them once, wouldn't cut very soft thin wood without bending. I am returning it and hopefully finding something that will actually work."
2,Disappointed,"I was really disappointed that many receipes called for dairy as it is not just my opinion but fact that diary is not benefical and can cause much more harm than good. ""Milk intake is positively associated with IGF-1 concentratons.... an increase in milk intake from 200 to 600 ml/d corresponded to a 30% increase in circultaing IGF-1""""when you combine the above with hundreds of studies in the scientific literature that have previously established that IGF-1 is a key factor in the proliferation and growth of every human cancer, shouldn't every parent be advised of thae danger of ingesting cow IGF-1 for their children?"" NO human in my opinion should consume cow milk/diary for any reason... check into the raw/vegan lifestyle and foods you think you cannot live without... you will find you can."
1,Dainty Daisy Cupcake pan,"I could not find liners to use with this pan. The mini liners were too small, and standard ones too big. I emperimented with different amounts of batter ahead of time. I was using the pan for my grandaugthers 5th birthday. I never could get the cupcakes to stand up, they were very top heavy. I was very dissapointed to say the least. I ended up giving the pan to my daughter to try with brownies or corn muffins. Maybe they won't fall down. The only good thing I could say about the pan, is that it was non stick."
5,all in one place,There is a specific knife for every project which makes each task a breeze. The box makes traveling to class easy.
4,Really convenient,"Great quality/price ratio. The box has a really nice finish outside, but the blades and x-acto are in a plastic -mold, not quite fancy. But according to the price, it was expected.The blades itself are really useful and easy to use, and of good quality :)"
2,All are on the same frequency.,I bought 3 of these for my nephews to find out that they all operates on the same frequency hence they cannot race/play together.
4,Blade is a bit loose,The blade is plenty sharp and does it's job well. However the blade is a bit loose in the handle and it falls out some times. If you are aware and careful you can tell when the blade is about to pop out and can push it back in so it works still.
2,Poor quality,"After the first swimming, a pebble on the dial edge was lost; after 2-3 weeks of usage the bracelet was scratched; not worth the money."
1,"Hot Boyz,When I went through my ""No Limit""Phase.","Hot Boyz, Except the Corvette Scene, the movie is really really bad, Not the worst of the NO Limit films,but bad.This was good when I went through my No Limit Phase(LOL) before they started to copy and bite too much and started to falloff."
4,Great blast from the past,"This was Cherelle's first album, defining her standing as one of the funkier artists of the 80's. ""Fragile"" was the first single, very upbeat, funky and danceable. What most listeners will recognize is ""I Didn't Mean To Turn You On"". This was a big R&B hit, and later the song became recognizeable to mass audiences as Robert Palmer covered it with his own version."
1,Not very accurate or useful,"I purchased this to make mixing oil for various yard equipment easier.Biggest annoyance is that it comes with a 6"" length of plastic tubing. The length is needed to extract the oil, but may or may not be included in the measurements. How can this be accurate?Also, the markings require you to ""Mix 4 times for one gallon"". I typically mix 2 gallons of gas at time, so i need to measure 8 times over? I thought this was supposed to save time!I am now using a graduated calendar to measure my 2-cycle oil. I suppose this tool will stay on the shelf as an all purpose extractor, but for the intended purpose it did not meet my needs."
1,Seriously misleading info,"...on product description page under ""Product Features"":Plastic construction; 15.8-ouncesNo, it is not 15.8 ounces -- it's only 2. So for mixing 5 gallons at 50:1 (12.8 oz) I'd have to measure seven times. No good. The advertised capacity of 15.8 oz was the only reason I bought it. Very disappointing.UPD: Product description has been changed to read ""2 ounces"". Too late for me though."
4,great price,"This is nice and sturdy, with lots of fine tuning option. The screw that keeps the projector from swiveling left to right is not that great and there is a little play in the fittings."
2,not so good,"This video is too 80ish for me, and I hate the music. Her warmup moves did not even go with the music, if you call it music. I'd suggest something more interesting. You'll get tired of this quick."
5,A great album by a GREAT Band,A great selection of Crowbar tunes.These guys are still rockin' and are finally getting the recognition that they deserve. These songs may be 40 years old but the production is so awesome that they still hold up well. If you're interested in Crowbar you should buy this album.
1,Rival meat grinder,"For the price, the machine did an okay job. But if you need a new rotary cutter blade, your out of luck. That key part is no longer available from the manufacturer. Now the grinder will just take up space in a landfill."
2,"OK for small jobs, can't get parts though","It will grind meat but rather slowly, which is ok if you just want to grind up a couple of roasts. I wouldn't recommend for working up a whole deer. The main reason not to buy, there is no way to buy replacement parts. I busted the ring collar on mine trying to push though some partially frozen meat and the plastic snapped. I e-mailed Rival and they said the model is discontinued, no parts available. Rival doesn't stand behind there products. Just like they don't stand behind there workers when they closed factories in Missouri and moved to China. Take your money and invest in something made of steel. You get what you pay for."
5,Good Review,"This presents a thorough but brief review of the social and economic factors involved in this deplorable period of history, with details from the records of one of the schooners involved."
5,"Finally, a fun alternative to Baby Einstein","My 1-year-old daughter received this DVD as a gift and she loves it- she smiles and laughs the whole time she watches it. She especially loves the ""Peek A Boo"" sequence. The DVD is nicely produced with good graphics and enjoyable music. All in all, a great alternative to the Baby Einstein videos."
5,Xacto Needle File Set,Nice set of files with useful wooden handle. Product was packaged very neatly and well padded. Nice item. Each file has many uses so very handy to carry.
4,This book is nicely put together,"This book relays elegant little Shamanic journeys, the author has taken, and marks a few roadsigns for a beginner to follow.I would categorize this book for beginners, and could easily be understood by young adults.My ONLY complaint is her version of the medicine wheel. Of the 12-15 medicine wheel traditions I have seen; this one is by far the most complex.Personaly; I prefer the medicine wheel tradition that is based on the vision of Oglala Sioux holy man Nick Black Elk.If you want to learn this easier medicine wheel tradition; contact me by E-mail.Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)"
1,very stupid,"Starts out, a guy beating the living tar out of another over zelda sparks(sarah carter),then the story line was as confusing as all get out to follow, Then the beautiful trans am firebird they shove off into a steep hill into the ocean.I love firebirds so that even makes me want rate this even lower.Im not going to give away the ending.I dont know whats worse the ending or the movie.Horrible acting,directing and poorly written.But this movie isnt even worth renting.dont waist your money on this movie.rent it first if you think its worth buying.I was dissappionted.Id give this movie a -15..take my advice watch it, before buying it..."
3,Simple Pleasures,"The other reviewers are right about this being nearly as mindless as is possible- and the music and ridiculously fake and repetitive sound effects (of girls squeaking and exclaiming) may drive you insane, but here's what they forgot to tell you; in nearly half of the trampoline scenes, one or more of these hot chicks are topless. Which alone makes it worth the price of admission, trust me. This is total, gratuitous eye candy that may lead to eye and neck exhaustion as you follow these hotties bodies up, and down, and up..."
3,struggling to get through it,"Yes, it is great they get topless and they jump around in sexy lingerie but you can only stand so much of it at one sittin, the first night i got through 10 minutes and had to shut it off and the next night i got through another 12 minutes, i might finish the whole 90 minutes some day."
1,"Run!! don't walk, away from Home Decorators Collection","This is the WORST internet buying experience I have ever had!!!!! Do NOT buy anything from this company! The merchandise looks beautiful online but their shipping policies require a 25% restocking fee and you pay all shipping costs for returned purchases. Their customer service is a NIGHTMARE!! Four months after I ordered these chairs, and I am fighting it out with Home Decorators Collection with both the Better Business Bureau and my credit card company about their deceptive internet policies. They are a company that should be driven out of business. Unless you want a disaster of a buying experience, don't buy from Home Decorators Collection!!!"
5,Best Grandparenting Book I've Seen - New Hampshire reader,"The Nanas and the Papas is the best one-stop-shopping book on grandparenting, whether you're a baby boomer or not. It's loaded with great tips and advice applicable to both nuclear and blended families. The real-life anecdotes are excellent. This is a very well researched book that covers all the bases. The Zullos have done a thorough job."
1,This IS a BORING BOOK,I didn't like reading this book because it had no action in it. I had to read it for english and i hated it. My friend and i Want more action in a book.
5,Listen to the CD dont compare to Tool.,This is another band that appear without having to advertise themselves to death and have come and made great songs.We can all compare each band with another but its another challenge for some people to just listen to the cd for what it is.Well worth a buy for the collection.
3,A band to lookout for.,I gave this cd a very generous rating before and have sinsed realized that it actually isn't as great as I stated. WHile this cd does have it moments it does sometimes feel like you're listening to a track you've already heard before. See for yourself.
3,Tool?,"I don't get the comparisons to tool at all. Music is not like tool and, I'm sorry...I hear this band I don't here Maynard James Keenan. Both of their cd's are good though."
4,EARSHOT IS NOT TOOL!,Earshot is not Tool. I dont know why everyone keeps giving Earshot such a hard time. Just cause they have good music everyone hates them. So what if they sound a little bit like Tool. All you Tool morons will buy the Earshot CD too. I like Tool but I like Earshot too. So all you people need to shut up and listen to Tool if you like them so much! Dont go bashing Earshot though!
1,Poor information,"The whole series from Mason Crest is poorly written, poorly researched, and way too expensive. Their whole series is not even worth giving away."
3,Let The Pink Flamingo Murders Fly onto Your Bookshelf !,"Although The Pink Flamingo Murders were written a few years ago, the appeal is timeless and Elaine Viets has a humorous way of involving the reader with her heroine-detectives. If you only read mysteries so you can outguess the author, then don't pick this one up -- you won't be able to satisfy your ego."
1,Dark Winter,"BORING- don't waste your time. I read ""Blood of the Reich"" by the same author and liked it very much."
3,Read This in the Summer,"This is just what we are used to from William Dietrich. Fast paced action, well thought out plot, and plenty of intrigue. I loved the book, storyline, the point he was making, etc. My beef is I bought this for the Kindle and this book contained more errors and typos than any book I have ever seen, particularly the last third (where the editor apparently fell asleep). Some sentences took a magic decoder ring to figure out what was supposed to be there. Someone should really clean this up if Amazon is going to keep selling it."
4,another classic,This book is number one for people who aren't having kids and just want something to look through.
2,Simple and unsurprising,"This was a very easy and simple read. I was disappointed that this ""thriller"" had no surprises in the book and was very predictable. I found myself wishing the book would just end because it was so obvious what was going to happen."
3,Screws Missing,"We are happy enough with it but some of the screws were missing when my husband put it together, plus there was a small dent on the edge of the tabletop."
3,Retro Table Set,My daughter bought this table to use as a table for 2. She likes the table but the black finish on the top does not stand up well to frequent use.
2,table set,"The set LOOKS awesome, but unfortunately the chairs rip easily. If you will be using this frequently, I suggest spending a little more money."
1,absolutely hate it,"I have had this table since February 2011. Up until now it has fallen apart, lack some direction putting it together, drilled in the wrong screws into the table, it came through the top, and the stools' screws coming out constantly to a point of getting lost. I am afraid to sit on it anymore. This was the worst buy and what gets me, I rarely used it."
5,awesome!!,This set was bought for my daughter who wanted it in her first apartment. Absolutely wonderful purchase!!! Perfect retro!!! Larger than I thought it would be and I put it together in an hour!!!Retro 3-Piece Chrome Bar Stools and Table Set
4,Bar Stool Set,"The set is ok. However, it did not arrive within the predicted delivery dates, it was ordered to be used at a birthday party, it arrived after the party."
4,Works for me,Easy to put together and looks great! Added a large Harley emblem and a glass top and I have a 300.00 table on the cheep.
3,A few threads missing from the quilt,"I have read this book out loud to my students on a number of occasions. I have come to the conclusion that whatever deep meaning Yolen wanted us to come away with is lost during the final chapters when we are so concerned about the quilted beast being destroyed. The secondary characters (Gorse, Tansy, etc.) are shallow, and simply provide Thornmallow with peers. I wish he was simply an apprentice to one of the more interesting wizards, with whom he could learn wizardy, and go off on an adventure, thus moving the excitement outside the rather boring walls of Wizards Hall."
2,"Good premise, but lags somewhat","This Harry Potter-esque book does have a pretty good plot, I'll give you that. It also has some interesting, funny, fast-paced parts with good dialogue. Unfortunately, I found that it lagged in many places, as Yolen's books tend to do. I often found myself skipping pages or putting the book down after readng 1-2 pages because I was bored. If you ordinarily enjoy Jane Yolen, then you would probably like this, otherwise I would pass."
3,Henry...,"This wild book series contains a charector that somewhat reminds me of Harry Potter. This story is also wonderful in the way that it shows the readers that anything is possible, as long as you try!"
2,A book to read while waiting for the next Harry Potter?,"Like many others, I've been looking for something to read while I wait for the next installment in the Harry Potter series. ""Wizard's Hall"" came highly recommended, but I must admit I was horribly disappointed. I'm VERY glad I only borrowed it from the library, instead of buying it. While I rather appreciated the poetic writing style, the book itself was downright BORING. I was over halfway through the book before anything remotely exciting started to happen. The story doesn't seem to flow very well, and I found the descriptions of the characters and places quite shallow and choppy. Not a horribe book, but certainly not worth the time spent reading it. Try Diana Duane's ""So You Want to be a Wizard"" for a good wizarding book or ""Little White Horse"" by Elizabeth Goudge for a slower-paced story with a wonderfully poetic writing style."
3,Good Book,"Generally this was a good book. i really enjoyed it and i couldn't put it down. its amazing to me how some people say that Harry Potter is better when it has a lot of the same ideas (like stars on the ceiling). the only problems were that it was too short, i read it in about 3 hours, and it kept saying the word ""try"". i know the whole piont of the book is that if you try, you'll succeed, but after saying it 10000000000000000000 times, it gets old. i would recomend this book to ages 7-12 but not much olderOther Recomendations: Harry Potter series, The Dark is Rising series (one of my favorites), His Dark Materials (my all time favorites in the world) and other science fiction/fantisies."
4,A Little Treat,"The Sixteen Pleasures is the mental equivalent of an ""amusee bouche,"" in France, a little treat served before the serious meal that tickles the palate. Although limited in terms of plot and character development, the book presents a thoroughly enjoyable story of Margot, a young American on a wonderful adventure abroad. The essence of youth, when one is so blissfully (and thankfully) ignorant of the gravity of life to come, and the essential beauty of Florence are captured here superbly. Try this delicious treat!"
2,No pleasures at all,"The title cites ""Sixteen pleasures"", and the back of the book states that the heroine explores each of these pleasures. I was expecting a mildly erotic story about the awakening of this young woman. I learned more about restoring frescoes and books than I did about erotica.It's an ok book, but they need to be clearer about what it's about. I felt duped, and that's not a good thing to feel while reading."
3,"Visit Florence, Italy",and learn how to restore Renaissance monographs at the same time. Very well written. Characters are fully drawn. Most satisfying.
2,Diappointing...,"Being a lover of love, the arts, Florence and tales of strong, discovering women, after reading the description of this book, I was very excited to begin!By page 20, I started feeling misled. By page 100, I started wondering if I was reading the right book. By page 200, I was debating whether or not I cared enough to finish.This book is barely about any of the subjects I mention above. Moreso, it includes a few drawn out parts about book conservation that, well, just weren't that interesting.I'm just glad I bought it used. And back to the used book store it shall go."
3,flawed but still enjoyable,"This book defies contradictory expectations: it is not the high-minded work I expected, nor is it the descent into pornography I expected once I found out the nature of the valuable work of art our heroine comes across. What it really is, I think, is a coming of age story where a young woman who belongs no where, gradually finds out just who she is and where she fits in and learns her own mind.The main problem is that the book doesn't have a consistent tone and its parts fight with each other--its a literary hodge-podge. Part of it is a primer on methodology for saving art, part an appreciation of classical books, part coming of age, part love story, part travelogue, and part literary thriller. However, there are delights to be found: the growing identity of the main character, the atmospherics of Florence, and the fascinating information on art and culture. It's easy to read and is worthwhile."
4,Nancy Drew Goes to Florence,"I am astonished that so many readers felt Hellenga didn't capture the feminine psyche in his character. As I was reading chapters in Margot's voice, I forgot it was written by a man! As a former Catholic school girl, I thought Hellegna was right on with the sisterly comraderie between Margot and the nuns, their appeal to her. Reading this book was like eating a sumptuous Italian meal; an easily attainable satisfaction. I was also amazed at the factual info about book and art conservation he was able to pack in -- and make compelling. I enjoyed it as a meandering, vicarious adventure ala Nancy Drew and other intrepid female protagonists. Too bad they'll probably ruin it by making it into a film starring Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis with graphic depictions of the Sixteen Pleasures."
3,"Jaunty saunter through Italy, but too many ups and downs","Few novels start better. I fell in love with the female protagonist in the first few chapters and fell decidedly out of love with her as the plot unfolded. The novel rambles, unwinding gradually. Too uneven to be really enjoyable right through, somehow parts feel hurried, losing a languid touch so effortlessly achieved at first. Aimless swipes at the Catholic Church just seem clumsy. Still, a remarkable first effort,"
3,Never builds any steam,"The Sixteen Pleasures is a well-written book; unfortunately, the story doesn't develop as nicely as the language. I never fully attached to the heroine, or any of her love interests. The author's greatest success is in describing the art conservation process - very educational and accurate. The book jacket simply promises more excitement than the story delivers.That said, I should mention that some of the issues/topics in the novel made for great discussion in my book club. We were able to pull out some juicy questions, so for that reaason, I'll give the book as many as three stars."
2,why did this get good reviews?,"This book completely disappointed me, and it's reassuring to see I'm not the only one. The premise of a young book restorer going off to Italy last-minute and to discover herself and, ultimately, a rare example of Renaissance 'pornography,' is fabulous. The characters, dialogue, and narrative are not. The voice is not consistent, the main character unsympathetic, the story amorphous, and the entire experience unsatisfying. Avoid this book unless you'd like a primer on book restoration."
5,At Long Last...............!,"I, too, have been waiting for this soundtrack to be released on CD for ages and ages - but life being what it is, I seldom remembered to pursue the quest. I had not listened to the score for many years (my only copy was on cassette and I haven't owned a cassette player for ages). As soon as the CD arrived, I tore into the box and slapped the disc into the player -- and was transported into a heaven I'd forgotten existed. Randy Newman's music is so absolutely wonderful and the remastering is excellent. I listen to ""Train Ride"" over and over again; a more perfect piece of popular music has seldom been written. And I say that as a rabid fan of classic Scott Joplin ragtime. It is all I can do at this point not to play this CD 24/7.......! Bless you, Rhino!"
3,"Listen to the score, not the songs.","This is a brief review of the score written for the movie, not the movie itself, a distinction perhaps lost on the earlier reviewers. The songs, like all songs that hitch rides on score albums, are to be ignored.A fun, brass-heavy action score. Lots of color and movement. Plenty of evocative, muscular string writing. It is, perhaps, John Williams-esque in character with a touch of James Newton Howard, but really, it's a Lee Holdridge show. Lee Holdridge has a deft hand with quick mood changes, working them effortlessly into the fabric of the music. There isn't a lot in the hummable theme department, however, which may render it not too useful for putting the little kids to sleep with.Far better music than the movie is likely to have deserved."
1,HORRID!,"One of the main flaws with the movie was that, like so many others, the others felt that the only way to keep children's attention was to throw in a song every 5 minutes. It made for a terrible movie, and terrible songs. A must miss if ever there was one!"
2,still listening,"Rythmically specific, no embellishments, interesting, arresting brass arrangments, not meant for the radio - then the singer happens. I can't quite tell if he sings well-below average on purpose or if he's merely preternaturally unqualified to croon. Whatever the case, it's not fun to listen to - the singing that is. And though you are aware of the talent, thoughtfulness and intelligence of the musicians, the music can become irritatingly, almost pretentiously repetitive, to the point where you want to ask: ""do you really like what you're playing THAT much?"""
2,Ingredients don't gel so well,"Examplary of little that can be good and mostly what can be bad with indie music, this brief (though pretentiously stretched out to not be an ep) album's superficial experimentation into what is essentially lousy songwriting sometime rises above the sum of it's dislocated parts, but rarely displays enough fleshed-out form to engage for an entire song. Works best as the textural wallpaper it feels of, as when the over-indulgent vocals and routine angularity are examined closely we see seldom (though a few profound) moments adding up to little more then generic noticeability."
4,"solid, soulful craftsmanship.","what? no more nautical elements? i picked this up in the ""Avant-rock"" section of kim' underground, but this sounds to me more like light indie-rock with an experimental twist. well-polished, etc. not as intrusive as some of the stuff on ""engine takes to the water"" for example, but very solid in its meanderings."
1,It's a Piece! Save Your Money!,"Where do I begin?! First of all the little happy dog on the ad for this product must have been sedated. The ""cool"" extended legs literally a flop. They are very unstrudy! Also the ""convenient"" food and water bowel didn't easily attach. Last, but not least the the side straps are confusing to assemble to my pet's harness. I had to email the company to get better instructions, because the info that came with the product was so vague."
1,Who is the audience?,"I made the mistake of not trying to rent this video first. When I bought the VHS I did not think it was going to be is technical. The dialogue was very ""cheezy"" and the emotional situations where very dull. I'll admit it was informative but it would be way over anyone who be thinking of drinking in the first place. I have seen other videos with a lot more impact on a viewer's opinion. If you are not a anatomy major please stay away from this VHS. Thank you for spending the time to read this."
3,"nice tv, but cable and antenna not possible","Wish the hookup to cable and antenna at the same time was present. Unless I am doing something wrong (which is very possible) you can either get your cable channels or your HD antenna channels, but not both at the same time. I have read where some TVs have separate coax for these 2 types of signals. Something to consider if you are in the market."
4,Excellent bedroom HDTV,"26 inch screen is great for watching HDTV and DVDs in the bedroom. I receive all the local HDTV over-the-channels on an indoor Radio Shack double bowtie UHF antenna, and I am 30 miles from the transmitter site."
4,Nice Summer's Evening,"Dan Gibson's Lakeside Retreat is first class like all the others. Dan Gibson Solitude's Dics are by far the best in this category. I have found the Solitudes to be the best quality of music, and nature blended together, I own over 30 Solitudes dics."
4,4 1/2 Stars Great Reunion CD,"This CD is a great one by The Geto Boys. I got this cuz I like the classic Mind Playin' Tricks On Me and I wasn't disappointed.Best Songs-1. G-Code- Great Beat, Lyrics and Addicting Chorus2. Yes Yes Y'all- Great Song all 3 of them Kill It Specially Bushwick Bill3. I Tried- Great Song4. When It Get Gangsta- Great Lyrics, Beat, and Chorus5. Declaration Of War"
3,"Not bad, yet not the best either.","As a fan of Pink Floyd, my favorite part of the band has always been David Guilmour's guitar licks along with Rick Wrights trademark keybord sounds. On this album, songs like Lets get metaphysical and All lovers are deranged had those kind of moments. Out of the Blue was a nice ballad. Blue Light has a good solo, but like the rest of the album is to much of an attempt to be pop instead of artistic. Overall, it is a good effort and good for a Pink Floyd fan, yet not essential. David Gilmour's 1978 solo album is a much better reflexion of him as a musician and not so pop oriented"
4,ESSENTIAL FOR ANY FLOYD LOVER,"David Gilmour's magnificent guitar talent and stylings make this album special. This was recorded in a period where he was not having fun anymore with Pink Floyd as he did an ""About Face"" with the tracks here showing him having a good time again. Sounding definitely Floyd-like throughout, there are a bunch of standout cuts especially the superb ballad, ""Out Of The Blue"". Bob Ezrin shared with Gilmour in producing this album as all 10 tracks included flow very nicely. If you enjoy Floyd, you will enjoy this CD."
3,Great music from Pink Floyd guitarist and singer,"The second solo album of a man who is instantly recognisable even if he plays a single note on his guitar. This is David Gilmour, and in this album we see a diversion from the Pink Floyd sound, but still being in the same framework.What is sometimes lacking is need for a concept in the album. But this is after all his personal album, free from the Pink Floyd banner, and he can do whatever in his mind, not a well established band's mind.Great music is the characteristic of this album, and frankly enough some of the songs are better than Pink Floyd's 'Momentary Lapse of Reason' album. Other ones are influenced by the 80's styles, which aren't my favourite at all. But that's only my opinion..."
3,Not recieved,"well, a month after ordering this product I still have not recieved it so I can't say if it is good or bad. I am starting to get a little upset about not getting it yet"
4,pretty good,"i love, love, love rilo kiley and was eagerly awaiting jenny's solo release. i was a little surprised at how acoustic the album turned out, which is both good and bad. i love jenny's quirky lyrics and her songsmanship, but i think something is missing without the backing of the rest of the band. jenny has a great voice, but i don't think it can carry some of these songs. still, this is a good album overall. just don't expect a rilo kiley album before you buy it!"
5,Excellent debut!,"I bought this CD on a whim and I am not disapointed at all! Jenny Lewis is the singer from Rilo Kiley, and she teams up with the Watson Twins on her debut RABBIT FUR COAT. I was transfixed by the songs, and that voice! She sounds wonderful, and I found the lyrics really resonated with me, coupled with the production and just overall sound of the album. There's a mixture of folk, pop, indie, soul and country to be found on this cd. I like all the tracks but highlights for me include ""Happy"", ""The Big Guns"", ""You Are What You Love"", ""The Changing Sky"" and ""Melt Your Heart"". Check this out! You won't be disapointed."
2,THE FATAL FLAW,"This album is unlistenable for one specific reason: backing singers. Is it ""The Watson Twins""? If so, Jenny needs to AXE THEM. Seriously, the only GOOD tracks are those which feature JENNY ONLY (title track; ""It Wasn't Me""). The rest is awful, overproduced studio glop."
3,They run small.,"I bought a size Medium for my husband who usually wears a size 32x32 pant. They just fit him. Hopefully, they don't shrink in the wash or they're going to be ""form fitting"", if you know what I mean."
5,"A fast-paced, absorbing read","This is a fast-paced, absorbing story by an author with a superb command of language. The settings and imagery are sophisticated and imaginative. Writing a novel of this calibre would be an achievement even for an adult -- for someone Ms. Pugsley's age, it is a phenomenal accomplishment. Looking forward to reading more by the same author."
1,Paperback 2011 edition is a disgrace to publishing,"The CreateSpace paperback edition is an absolute disaster -- This is a NO STARS review. The book is full of typos, is hard to read, and there are NO illustrations. This could have been a real buy, but the problems make it very difficult to read and understand. I'm sending the copy I just got back for a refund. I am extremely disappointed."
4,Great family film,"The Pacifier is a wonderful family film. Funny, good story line and for the most part well acted. It is the perfect relaxing movie."
2,Pacifier fires back,The PacifierStarring Vin DiesilOkay what ever first of all I got to say DISAPOINTINGvery disapointing. To tell you the truth I love th comedy scenes but the movie over all I felt a little disapointed over. I actually expected a lot more from this movie. This movie would have maybe been okay for a six year old but Teens serious chance they wont.!?!?!By: Stephanie from Somerset Ky.
2,"Do yourself a favor, get something else!","This movie might have been better if it was the first time the ""bad kids vs. tough guy"" thing had been used. It seemed painfully preused, and of course, the bad kids and tough guy love each other in the end, the bad guys are locked up, the tough guy gets his hot chick. Plus, the acting was bad and, being a kid myself, I can say that kids aren't actually that way in real life; they were also painfully ""Disney-fied"". Go get youself a less predictable movie!"
1,Just for clarification,"Many of the reviews of this CD rave about the fact that Foreigner made ""some of the best music of the 80s"".Don't these people know that the first three Foreigner albums were released in 1977, 1978, and 1979?As for this CD, don't buy it. Corporate greed strikes again, as most of the songs that were singles are here insome edited form or another, the same goes for the 2-disc ""Anthology"".These same songs can be gotten in their entirety on ""The Definitive Rock Collection"", as well as some Lou Gramm solo tracks. That, in my humble opinion, is the collection of choice. I bought the other two collections, and as soon as I realized the songs were bastardized, I gave them away.This collection is not worth the aluminum and plastic they used to make it."
3,Buy Very Best and Beyond instead,"This album has radio versions, you know, where they cut 15-20 seconds of the song out to make radio-friendly versions of the song. Radio friendly means a shorter version of a good song, without the whole guitar solo, or without part of a chorus sung so the radio station can cram more advertisements instead. Very Best and Beyond has two songs not found elsewhere, With Heaven On Our Side and Prisoner Of Love, plus Rev On The Red Line. This CD has Headknocker, Long Long Way from Home, Blue Morning Blue Day, Women, Girl On The Moon, and Heart Turns To Stone. The drawback being Single versions/Radio Versions of other songs. Otherwise this is the better CD!"
3,all you need,Foreigner and Double Vision are all you need. Dont bother with this fluff. 3 stars for the songs included from these aforementioned albums. Nuff said!!!
4,Foreigner,All songs are hits. If you have seen a Canadain comerical then you have heard these tunes. Buy it if you like good 80s tunes
5,Foreigner: COMPELTE Greatest Hits,"I am a fan of Foreigner. When I first heard of this compilation, it sparked my interest. I decided to look it up and I saw that it had ALL of my favorite Foreigner songs.A must-own for any Foreigner fan and/or any classic rock fan.BEST greatest hits from ANY artist in years (Since Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers: Greatest Hits)."
2,Time for a new editor,"As is typical for these books, the new edition is a warmed over version of the previous book. Unfortunately, the statistics are so old in some cases, the students to which they applied could now have their own kids in college. For example, the data for the U of Wisconsin SAT scores is at least 10 years old. Current scores total at least 200 points higher. Also the library data of 4.8 million volumes is over 1 million shy of the current figure. As they buy about 100,000 books per year that's a 10 year gap. Several other factual errors are easily spotted. There are no bars on Mifflin St-it's State St. Students work out at the SERF, not the NAT. The SERF was built at least 15 years ago. Overall a sloppy and sometimes erroneous piece of work."
1,Bad sising and customer service,"I bought 2 pajama sets ,size small, for a xmas present from Intimo. Both tops were like extra large and both bottoms were like extra small. I returned them at my cost($10.00). Intimo did not correct the problem as promised or phone me back as promised. One month later, they emailed me that the sizing was correct. WHAT??? Intimo issued me store credit. NO REFUNDS. Would you have faith in buying here again with the strong potential for the same result at your return cost? Credit card disputes did not help. Don't shop with Intimo!!! I regret it.Intimo Women's 100% Silk Pajama"
1,Not 12-ply,"Not worth the money. The 12-ply pads in the retail stores are more expensive but are truley '12ply'. You have to use several of these to get the same absorbancy/padding as the more expensive ones. Unfortunately, these are not worth buying."
4,MY GIRLS LOVE THIS TOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought both Dora knows your name and Elmo knows your name and my girls love them!!! The best part is the timer system, it allows you to yet certain times for them to say something, like goodnight, I'm hungey, etc... Great toy!!!"
1,Do not buy kindle version..it's not same as paperback,"I had paperback version. The kindle version is missing dream symbol dictionary, which was the specific reason for me to buy this book again. I am disappointed."
3,Okay... better with Scorsese,"This is a low budget film, but I found myself really liking the overall plot and actions of the characters. Still no great movie, though."
1,Disappointed!,"I was disappointed with this software. I believe that it could help my son (age 3 1/2) learn to tell time, if it could only keep his attention! Compared to his other software programs, the graphics are simplistic, and there is only one task to do, over and over."
1,misleading,this cd does not actualy teach you how to speak finnish its just has convosations and you just listen to them. not much help
5,Honestly revealing,"As a pastor I found that this story will preach forgiveness and restortion. Minister E.T. Davis II shares his soul and allows us to walk his journey with him. The story is told in a honestly revealing way so as to encourage us that there is always a message in our mess. All of us have a prodigal story that needs to be told. The Prodigal Returns reminds us that coming home should always be a celebration, no matter what the reason is for leaving."
5,Blessed in Texas,You can not go wrong when purchasing any of these series!It is Good Clean movies that have a Powerful Message for real life situations.The entire family can watch and be Blessed![ASIN:B0002ERWVE Touched by an Angel - The Complete First Season]]
3,An Evolving Series,"This is a show that clearly evolved as the seasons went on. I gave season one to my daughter as a Christmas present. While I enjoyed watching season one for the first time with her, if I had it to do it over, I would not have started with season one. In comparison to the later seasons, it only skims the depth of storytelling that happens later.The show is finding itself and in comparison to the later seasons, it's the weakest. Despite that, viewers can still enjoy this season of Touched by an Angel. It's still enjoyable entertainment with wonderful characters."
5,Simply Wonderful,"Touched by an Angel - The Complete First SeasonThis series is simply wonderful. God's power, love and mercy come to life in an awe inspiring way. I highly recommend it."
2,Its Okay,"For the Price, It is NOt worth It. You DO NOT even Get a BRUSH! Also No Instructions, On How best To apply it, so You'd be better Off Buying these colors at a Drug store - be cheaper and At Least Youd get a Dam Brush!It is Packaged well, in Pretty Pink cannister, But.. come On for $40.00 You cant include a Brush and some instructions? Im Pissed I Bought this... Dont bother People. QVC has it, it cost More, there even!"
2,Remote Transmission of Rainfall Is a Problem,"Everything about this remote rain gauge is fine, except that it wouldn't transmit data remotely from outside the house. I suspect that the rain gauge has difficulty sending the remote signal through the walls of a house -- which is what you need to do! I could get the unit to work fine with both the gauge and the base unit in the house, but I could not get a transmission from outside the house to inside.I followed up with Cheney Customer service and found that the device will not transmit through the metal or brick of house frames. This limitation should be prominently mentioned on the box!Other than that, there are battery indicators for the both base and gauge, settable millimetres (0.0) or inches (0.00), and a large display of the rainfall. I really wish that the system worked. It would be fine if it could transmit the remote signal to the base unit."
2,"When it works, it works well","I am on my second exact same model rain gauge and now this one has quit as well. They last about a year and that's it. It shows 0.00, but when it rains, it doesn't read anymore. The last one did the same thing."
1,Accurite Rain Gage Review,"First of all, I bought this item at Walmart for $20. So the Amazon base price is about $15 too high, not to mention the additional shipping cost.The original unit didn't work - the digital display jumped from zero to .66 inches all at once triggering the alarm (with no rain falling). Then we had a rainstorm, and it read .00 inches the whole time. I thought perhaps I had bought a lemon, so I took it back to Walmart. They cheerfully swapped it out for another. Same story for unit #2 - the counter just jumped from zero to over an inch. Walmart once again was very nice and refunded all of my money.Given that a couple of people have had good results, I'm guessing the design is OK but the manufacturing QC over in China is poor. But as far as I'm concerned, this instrument is a piece of junk."
4,Fine product,We have had this for over a year now and have no problems. We have the receiver in the house and the sending unit out on the deck. It transmits fine to the receiver. I would suggest to the other person reviewing the product that he place the 2 parts close to a doorway or window for the signal to transmit. My only problem is that the sending unit blew off my deck and I have to get a new one.
1,Bad hub,Bought this hub to expand my laptop USB ports. From the minute I plugged it in I had problems. The driver froze my laptop and I had to constantly reboot. I disconnected the hub and everything works fine now. I'm looking for a new hub now.
1,"Bought two of these a year ago, one died",The design of this hub is a nice idea. Five ports on the back plus 2 more ports facing up that are convenient for USB drives (7 ports total). Unfortunately like many of the other reviews one of the two I bought died. I cannont recommend because of the reliability problems.
2,Overheats,"I am on my second one of these and both had problems with overheating and all devices would then stop working. I have tried to create extra air space to keep it cool, but every couple of weeks it gets extremely hot to the touch and all my USB devices stop communicating. I would recommend looking for another USB hub. Running on an iMac with Snow Leopard."
3,USB problem solved by Belkin,A nagging USB problem was disappearance sporadically of My Book external J-drive from My Computer. Solved by Belkin.
2,"Great for a while, but then it's toast",Ive had the same problem posted by others... worked great for 6mos or so but now it's toast and only works intermittently.
4,transition,"Robot is a regenereation story. Tom Baker is the iconic Doctor, arguely the best and most well known Doctor. Added to this is the presence of the late Elizabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane and Nicholas Courtney as Brigadier Leftwich-Stewart, the Doctor eases into what is probably the most well written and executed era in the series. Gone are the gadjets and James Bond like persona of the Third Doctor played by the late Jon Pertwee, Baker's Doctor is playful at times and very tough at others. Baker would go on to play the Doctor for seven years, twice as long as any of the previous actors in the role and those since he left the part. In a sense, the series declined ever so gradually after Baker's departure from the role until its end in the late 1980's Robot is a fun story in the King Kong mode and when it ends, the Doctor, Sarah Jane and Harry are off on further adventures in time and space. I was very pleased with the speed that Amazon got this product to me"
3,Doctor Who: Robot,"Tom Baker is always worth watching, even when the special effects are not so special, even ludicrous. But now my collection is complete."
4,Tom Baker's first Who,"Tom Baker's first full episode appearance as the good doctor. It was not the best episode of the Baker era, but still entertaining none the less, and served to set the tone for the 4th doctor and his relationship with Sara Jane. Fun from begining to end."
4,Very nice..got it for great price,My kids love this. Chair is not as big as I thought but nice...table and chair could be a little more stable but for the price and all that comes with it..it is a great buy.
3,Too big for my dog,"I read the measurements of this toy carefully, hoping it would work for my dog. It was just too big for her. If she grabbed a ""tentacle"" and tipped it on its side to try and carry it, it was too stiff and tall.I ended up giving it to a friend who has a big Golden Retriever, who loved it!"
4,Tuffy was Stuffed Beyond Belief--I removed stuffing,"The toy was stuffed to the gunnels. In fact, it was so tough my dog couldn't get it in her mouth. I slit open the body and pulled out all the stuffing which left the toy very sturdy but soft enough that my dog could throw it around. I love the 8 squeakers in each leg and the edging makes it very durable. My dog throws it around and loves to play with it. Maybe less stuffing would be good but the durability was what I bought it for and that is excellent."
3,almost nailed it,a great selection of the artists work .....really shows the scope of the artists talent....but some of the songs included in this CD should never have seen the light of day...overall OK as long as your skip button functions .....
1,BAD!,"BAD! at least that is what I think, the only pretty good track is Anxiety. This is such a bad cd its worth buying it just to break it. But this is my opinion, if you like Club 69 and Lords of Acid, this is the cd for you!"
4,No Journey's End,"Gifted Artist.Mummer's Dance was my favorite.All the tags apply.Celtic,ethereal and yes angelic.Loreena's voice is other worldly.The Mummer's Dance Video was wonderful.not much else I can say that has not been said."
4,give it a read,"I thought it important to say that this books does not come from the same viewpoint as ""Closing of American Mind"" -- to which it is often compared. The ideas here deserve a read by anyone interested in education and especially by teachers."
4,"worth the read, also check out the Dictionary","Worth the read, some interesting ideas to chew on. Someone mentioned in a review about putting the stuff in the list online. Well, there is a book by the Hirsch called ""The Dictionary of Cultural Literacy"" which might be a nice compliment to any classroom, I have one in my 3rd grade class."
4,This book is a must read for parents and teachers,"As a future educator it is very important to familiarize oneself with various educational theories and this is one that definitely should be included one's repetoire. The concept of cultural literacy is very controversial in many ways, but it is well worth the discussion that it inspires. This book is bound to evoke a strong response from its readers."
5,Stunning!!,This vase is sooo beautiful!!! I bought it about a year ago and I still think it is the most beautiful vase I have ever seen. I even got the bowl to match. They are georgoous. Thanks Amazon!!
4,'Reductionist' Dub,"Imagine the effect channels on an old dub-reggae mixing desk; they'd be noisy, full of warmth, colour, and probably the heartbeat of any respectable dub track, with most of the chattering, shuddering chord material and light percussion trickling along and repeating until they disappear into the depths of inaudibilty. Well, 'Reduce' features this tone-colour throughout its long, sub-bass driven tracks, complimented by kick drums that harken to the hardest of techno. The album, while unique, sometimes flounders about in its own material, and the listener can feel less than welcome - as if the tracks are too occupied with their own agenda, and us 'mere' listeners are an extraneous option; cast aside like a soggy tissue. This feeling is only fleeting, and it is the album that draws these same listeners back in with some seriously catchy sub tunes and clever delay effects."
3,A fun item,It is fun and can do a variety of tasks I really enjoy using it but it's not a reliable tool for me just entertainment.
1,Just plain bad....,"This season of Survivor should have been the best yet. Problem is, it wasn't. Two non-tribal council episodes, the sickening sappy relationship between Rob and Ambhhaaaa... ruined the whole series. Skip this box set and watch the new season coming up.Oh yea... Vote for Kerry, help save America."
2,Started off great,"How do you have that stupid no talent looser pathetic embasell idiot Boston rob screw him and his little girlfriend.Colby,Etan,and Rupert were the best the show ever had.Colby was the best of all time and one of the 2 peolpe who could survive on a deserted island him and Rudy who if he was Colby's age would have made the show a classic.The Best by far was Season 2 wich was also the Highest rated one."
5,Best Survivor Season!,"Survivor: All Stars, was the best season hands down. I have seen seasons 1, 2, 6, 8, 16, 18 - 23. And All Stars was by far the best. I have seen every episode at least 5 times! They brought back my favorite contestant, Amber Brkich. They also had Boston Rob Mariano, Richard Hatch, Rob Cesternino, Alicia Calaway, and Rupert Boneham! If you are debating on which season to get, get All Stars. No competition. I often don't like the seasons where they bring the Survivors back because they are all like, ""I played this game once before..."" ""I know how this works,"" and blah, blah, blah. But this particular season was very well done. No complaints, except for maybe that they put the order of the people voted out on the from cover of each disk. So, always open the disk upside down and that solves one problem! So that's all my complaints and the bonus footage is hilarious. Awesome season. Favorite one yet! Order it...now!"
3,Can't recommend if stupidity frustrates you,"All Stars...Well...it was an OK season, but maddening in it's spotlight of incredibly stupid decisions people made.It has it's moments. Hatch is as annoying as ever. Lex is inexplicably naive. Jeri is smart but irritating. And the fact that there is such an in-your-face, obvious alliance between Rob and Amber, and NO ONE bothers to break them apart or even question this alliance. It's as if appearing on other seasons never taught anyone anything. And Rob and Amber were by no means secretive about their relationship. So, an obvious alliance is allowed to orchestrate the game. It is just maddening, as a viewer, to see presumably smart people act so dumb.All in all...nothing new to see here, unless you are a SERIOUS Survivor fan. Otherwise...this can be one for the rental que."
1,Survivor All Stars,"Started watching and enjoying very much discs 1-4, then put in disc 5 and it will not play. I tried it in 2 different players. This is very annoying. I have to go to UPS and hope they can print the label from my phone. They won't exchange it. I have to send it back and buy a new one."
4,Why not release S:Outback first?,"When they first announce that they would bre releasing full season DVD sets of Survivor, the initial plan seemed to be to release the first two seasons as a test for further editions. Why did this change? Now, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the All Star season, but I would rather have the release of Survivor: Outback first being that it no longer is so fresh in my mind. Many people consider the Outback season to have one of the finest cast. Hopefully S2 will be released soon."
5,A keeper!,"This is a good DVD. It covers many if not all the things you will need to know when sculpting. I am new to the clay media as I have only ever used lost wax casting, so it was very informative to watch someone sculpt and then adapt that knowledge to my own projects.A very good visual guide!"
3,shields down,"to all who may purchase this toy. This is by far the greatest display model ever built! but I recommend that for those actually looking for something to carry 50,000 storm troopers, as well as something that can make the jump to warp 3, I suggest you look else ware. This toy, though the replica of a military imperial vessal is nothing more than show. Its delightful purpose is only that of bragging and excess to the things you own.All in all, this is a very fun product.I encourage all with money to spend that you buy this particular toy."
3,The Valuation of Apartment Properties,I am an Romanian appraiser and for the moment I read not this book. I read only the review write by Stephen Traub and I think it is an interesting and useful book even for an non american.
3,maybe 3 1/2 stars,"I am a builder / carpenter that collects carpentry books for ideas and for the purpose of tryinng to stay current with new techniques. I purchased this book used from an Amazon reseller, and upon receiving it am dissapointed. The book is very out of date and due to its age, is not comparable to newer books in terms of illustrations. I have several books that are significantly better for carpentry / framing. I would not recommend this book."
2,OLDER VERSION,THIS BOOK IS A LITLLE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I EXPECTED BUT THE IDEAS ARE GREAT JUST A BIT OF AN OLDER BOOK. OKAY PRICE
5,A Terrific Book,"This book is a beauty. It's a coffee table tome, but slightly smaller, so it fits easily in the hand, and the historic photos, both black & white and color, are crisply reproduced and delightful to study. The text manages to be both learned and droll; the author is evidently a lover of both airplanes and animals, and an elegant, engaging writer. You'll choose your own favorite airborne animal. Mine was Billy, the goat with a parachute, and Kiddo, the airship cat. And there's the Red Baron's flying Great Dane! Not that he's likely to have had a hamster. Highly recommended!"
4,I think I'm in a time warp...,"I am a baby boomer, turning (ugh) 50 this year but swear I don't feel it. I remember this album so, so very well from my 20's...""Children of the Sun"" being my favorite. I went over to a guy's apartment and brought it with me and stupidly left it there. Now here I am with two kids in college, ordering Dino on amazon.com so I can play it for myself, and see if my daughters will feel his music the way I did. I love his voice and the guitars. I just ordered the CD and I am psyched to play it as loud as I want (Dad can't tell me to turn it down anymore) and either (a) get goosebumps or (b) say ""What was I thinking?"" Something tells me (a) will be my final answer."
2,"Band great, But why reviewers did not talk more of deficient audio","The disc of this show with this band and performance is good enough to keep, but considering this is a Blu-ray disc, the audio MUST be flawless, and unfortunately is not.This Blu-ray disc has several issues with audio, although the video seems fine. The harshiness of the audio recorded from the sax and the electric guitar are overpowering an otherwise balanced piano and bass.The accoustic guitar of Clapton was almost silent in one of the songs, he was playing most of the song while the camera was filming the silent strings.The content is still valuable enough to keep it as a good memory."
2,Somebody kill Sanborn's mic!!! PLEASE!!!,"I just caught this right now On Demand. Being a big Clapton fan, my girl excitedly put it on for me.It started pretty cool, although it's pretty clear that Clapton is out of his comfort zone. He's well aware of it and simply tries to hide the fact by playing really fast. Hell, I still love the guy. He still presented us with awesome licks during the course of the show; even if it didn't quite fit in.Marcus Miller is DOPE!!! Simple as that. His being on this show is such a treat.Joe Sample is a wasted talent here.My main gripe?! DAMMIT!!! Somebody tell David Sanborn to stop hoggin all the solo spots! Even when they're playing ensemble licks - He's hella loud! It got really distracting and annoying. I was ready to turn it off just because of this him. Believe me, I like all instruments, but Sanborn just goes and goes and goes. All while being super loud. I'll keep it real - only a saxaphone player can appreciate this much Sanborn."
2,"Intelligent, but not interesting.","Julie Sheehan is an intelligent poet with a fine ear and an ability to craft a finely wrought line. And while I have no problem with formal poems, or even with Sheehan's ironic archaic voice, the content of the poems is not terribly interesting, and not at all moving. I admire her craft and I see her humor, however, most poems sound like a very clever, and very bored, English major looking for an assignment. I wish more poets of this generation had Julie Sheehan's linguistic ability and I especially wish that this poet had something to say."
3,difficult to misplace is the best feature,"I bought this blue tooth earpiece after loosing a previous one less than 48 hours after buying it. So I was looking for something that could hang around my neck... that being said, it also has pretty good sound quality for the price and without the fancy noise cancellation (at least so I've heard from people I talked with).I am not a fan of the in ear hookup, but it is surprisingly comfortable and does not fall off easily.Things that caused me to reduce the rating to only three stars: the charger is not a mini USB, or micro USB, making finding a charger for it rather difficult; the earpiece slides easily on the cord, making pulling it out by the cord difficult as it keeps slipping on the cord and won't pop out as easily from under a coat or sweater; it keeps on disconnecting and reconnecting - but i don't know if that is the phone's fault or the bluetooth...Overall, a relatively good buy, despite the annoying Nokia internal ring-tone (I'm not a Nokia fan)."
1,Item does not match the picture...,"The actual item does not match the picture. Instead of having ""CENTRAL FLORIDA"" across the top, it has ""UCF"" in very small letters and is barely legible. The top part is mostly whitespace. The word ""KNIGHTS"" is also smaller than pictured, but is at least legible. On either side of the ""KNIGHTS"" are the Knight mascot rather than UCF. If the actual item had been shown, I would not have purchased it."
2,Respighi Chamber works,"This CD is miss labled, it does not contain what is listed. There is no six pieces for violin and piano. Track one goes to track four, which is the piano quintet. Five through seven is a sonata for violin an piano. The CD is good but the label should be corrected."
5,Best of my collection,"Too many five star reviews in here. But this one is really deserved. Alison Moyet has a rich and sultry voice which is not dimished by too much playing nor does her voice breed contempt through familiarity like every other female vocalist I can think of. This CD is a slice of my life and has seen me through more relationships and life changes than anything else I have in this existence.In my dreams, Alison sings me to sleep. I'd give this one more stars if I could."
3,What is the date?,"Moyet's voice is as sharp and innate as ever: However the sounds here are a bit dated. The production is the problem, not the material. There is a sense that the production team was trying a Jolley/Swain v/s Yazoo thing here. It doesn't work on every track. Had this album been acapella, I would have fainted, I know. ""Blow Wind Blow"" is simplistic and stands the test of time wonderfully. Bottom line - the tracks are dated. Moyet has stated that she didn't enjoy making this album, although she couldn't offer any specifics: I think I've found the specific - no truth to her craft."
3,Not her best,"Although it does contain some good tracks,this is one of those albums you wonder what could have been.If you are not a Alison Moyet fan than i say skip it.You can get the best parts of this cd of Singles.This album suffers from bad son writing.Alison went from New Wave (or something like it) to pop.I think they really were just trying to break out in the states.Also this is pretty much a reproduction of ALF.Of course no one could ever capture the magic that was on Alf."
5,Outstanding piece of fiction - or is it true??,"Outstanding writing. Outstanding piece of fiction. OR, is it a true story? This book kept me glued to it until I finished it. Some of the characters reminded me of people that I have actually known and the author had me believing that they were the ""real McCoy"" from my past. This author will go far if he continues to write works like this one. I highly recommend the book and the author, should he write more in the future. I even recommended this book to my Hadassah group and we are reading it as a ""Book of the Month"". MAZEL TOV, Dr. Wullfson!"
3,Not the Place to Start,"This record was my real introduction to this band (My vinyl copy melted in a girlfriend's car in the high school parking lot!), but in retrospect, it's probably not the place for someone to start.The songs ""Heaven"" (great video) and ""The Ghost in You"" are absolutely beautiful and perfect (the best thing this amazing band ever did). The rest of the record sounds like commercial filler.One of the greatest hits records is probably better for the uninitiated. Me? I'd pick up any of the first three records. They all demonstrate the evolution of a truly remarkable band."
4,Best in years,"Sinead O'Connor's first couple of albums were magnificent ground-breaking stuff which still sound great today. After that, her successes were more sporadic as she searched for a focus for her vocal talent and identity, often sounding hesitant and constrained. This is her best album in many years, singing with renewed confidence on a collection of purely traditional Irish songs that she clearly loves, such as Peggy Gordon, Lord Franklin, The Moorlough Shore and The Parting Glass, with a sympathetic cluster of excellent musicians ranging from Donal Lunny and Sharon Shannon to the dub On-U Sounds of Skip MacDonald (Little Axe) and Adrian Sherwood(review originally filed July 2003)"
5,A work in progress,"This book is a fantastic resource for anyone interested in behaviorism or anyone who knows a child on the Austic Spectrum.If this topic isn't your cup of tea, then there's no reason for you to be interested in this book, but if you are into this sort of thing, it's amazing."
5,also for calenders,besides the good photo quality I like the fact that its backside can be printed as well which makes it very suitable for calenders
1,I feel bad for the students at U of Arizona,"Well, I finally found a Cantonese course that was worse than the Instant Immersion product. Their romanization is the most confusing I've seen, with several words jammed together to make large, hard-to-read words. From what I can tell, this course also totally ignores the tones in Cantonese, making it extremely difficult to tell exactly which word is being mangled in their horrid spelling. It's obviously intended as a companion to a course in their university and is almost useless on its own. The very first lesson contains dozens of new words used in poor context. Definitions are not always easily found and the native speakers in the audio/video clips are so fast I suspect they work in an auction house in their spare time.Don't waste your time here. Try Pimsleur's wonderful (though short) course or the Teach Yourself course by Hugh Baker. The Language Learning course from Laser Publishing Group is okay too."
4,A pleasant surprise!,"I bought this book because my son has taken an interest in dandelions and I thought it would be fun to cook a few recipes for him. I was pleasantly surprised by all the information in the book - nutrition of dandelions is covered extensively, as well as some folklore on the plant and not to mention more recipes than I could try in a year. Ideas on how to extend the harvest are included as well.My only negative thoughts - the author states that he has over 600 recipes for dandelions, but only shares a fraction of them! He has also written a book on daylillies, which I will definitely get."
5,The Book of Virtues for young people,"We have always been Bill Bennett fans in our house and this book did not disappoint. We bought this for our son who is turning 13 to inspire and provoke thoughtful conversations. The book is full of stories and poetry broken down into 10 categories. (ie.courage, work, honesty, loyalty) This book is written so that an adolescent could read it themselves or it is also very well suited as a read aloud. I would recommend this book to anyone from 8 to 108."
3,Get what you pay for,"Packaging was junky, plastic wrapping was stuck in zipper of carrying case. Difficult to get table out of case, and almost impossible to get back in - it still won't re-zip closed. The table itself is OK, though the seam didn't always want to lay flat. Would probably work better if table top is the same size as the product (my table is about a foot shorter - 6 inches over the edge all around). Served it's purpose for occasional home game. Not fine furniture, but what do want for $50 or so?"
1,Be warned - Not in Stock!,"This merchant advertises products that have been out of stock for weeks, and has no customer service whatsoever. Unlike other Marketplace merchants, they do not confirm your order, give you updates or tracking info, or make any contact with you whatsoever. You just get an email from Amazon that your order was placed--but nothing else. Then, 8 days later, you get another email from Amazon that the merchant has canceled your order because this item is not actually in stock. Then your order disappears from your Amazon account so you can't leave any merchant feedback. Try another merchant, like ArtApart, instead--they let you know immediately that the item is not in stock."
1,South Africa after Apartheid,"Great acting by Jackson and whole crew. Story ruined by makeshift love interest. African dialect very hard to understand and sound quality poor. They took a serious subject and trivialities it with short choppy incomplete stories. Also, even after Apartheid I don't think blacks were given free reign as shown or would a white woman sleeping with two blacks be condoned. No depth, just short vignettes."
4,"A new prog band, a must for any prog music fan","They came from nowhere with an amazing album, very good, intelligent, great performance and feeling in their music. I think the best are the title track and ""The water"", I like very much ""Go the way you go""You will listen to it few times and the melody will be in your head for a long time. Again, two thumbs up for this amazing debut album."
4,"Apart from the usual derivative moments Genesis-like,it's OK","Well the fantastic INTRO was a promise, but soon there was a controversial question, because some derivative moments Genesis-like and the forced ones in the vein of modern rock style,created some question marks, above all if We make a comparison with another US band- Echolyn - of ""Suffocating the Bloom"", performing a great album in the same period!! But the best instrumental breakthrough it's well worth checking out ... if They were less prolix (listen to the last mini-suite ""The water/the edge)this album could have been put among the best 20 prog albums ever...instead.Recommended!! But before this listen to ""Beware of Darkness"""
2,Moderately meaningful,"2 1/2Surprise, surprise ; a pseudo-epic neo-prog debut that is short on engaging interplay and long on pompous delivery."
2,music teacher and James Brown fan,"Of all the books I have in regards to Mr. Brown, I couldn't find the groove of this one. For me, it was trying to be too philosophical about Mr. Brown's career. (example: just because Mr. Brown is African American does not mean his music was inspired by some mystic African ""spirits"" from the ""motherland;"" maybe Mr. Brown just developed a new groove and went with it! Just because I have Scottish blood in me, doesn't mean I hear bagpipes in my sleep). There are certainly other books available that better describe Mr. Brown's life and career."
1,AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA,"AHAHAHAHAHAHA...This S ucks!Throwdown is a terrible band and should be incarcerated for making music this bad.This isn't hardcore, this is some tough guy jagoff rapping and swearing (he isn't the greatest wordsmith).Hatebreed is bad enough...we don't need nor want another."
4,Flawed beauty,"Mssrs...Finn, O'Maonlai and White deliver a flawed but at times hidden gem. Basically a loosely recorded collection of songs...at times poor in quality...there is one or two songs of depth and simple beauty to stir your soul. 'I decided to fly', 'The day you were born' and 'The refuge tree'stand out. O'Maonlai's voice...as always...ebbs and soars. By far the strongest vocal of the three...he is supported by the harmonising talents of Finn and the simple naivety of White...never more so than in 'The refuge tree'...all three vocals coming together...simply...yet with beautiful effect. 'The day you were born' is as sweet as a childs lullaby...yet stunning in it's simplicity. Yes...at times this sounds amateurish and resembles an out-take...thrown together. Some of the songs simply dont stand up to closer scrutiny...but that would be picking hairs. Hidden gems...look closer and you'll see...polish them and they simply shine..."
5,Great for even 15 mos!,"My 15 month old daughter loves all the I spy little books. I didn't think she would be ready for them, but after receiving this one as a gift, we've gone out and bought more. Although she loves to read, we find she seems to be more patient when we read this book and sits in our lap trying to spy for 20 minutes at a time (since we reread it)."
3,snow shovel 30 inch,shovel works great took a little longer to ship then expected and the shovel corner was bent when i got was not worth it to send back to fix would of had to pay for shipping and it was already $50.00-$60.00
1,Nothing New Here...,"While it was probably a great deal of work, this author has done little more than regurgitate what is already written in the Cluetrain Manifesto, Customer Relations Management 101, and downloaded from sites on the net. I found very little that was new or enlightening in this tome. I was hoping for some new and invigorating concepts in marketing...but it's not here."
2,Hmmm. Confused.,"I didn't really like this book. It may be helpful for someone who was living on the other planet for couple past years, or had not Internet connection. Or may be I am too critical. Or whatever else. I just may be didn't like it."
1,Disappointing!,"I had heard great things about this book, but was really disappointed reading it. There are a lot of historical inaccuracies and anacronisms, and all the action happens ""off-stage"" so to speak. Hardly anything is actually dramatized, so it all feels very distant. I am very interested in the Children's Crusade, but felt this doesn't capture the medieval mindset at all and does not do a good job of capturing the fervor of the time. Perhaps the original Dutch version is better, but I'm afraid that the English one is to be missed."
3,A Good Fantasy,"This wasn't my favorite book, but it wasn't bad. Shannon Hale isn't a bad writer. I don't mean that at all. Some of the writing in this book was beautiful. However, in my opinion, it dragged on far too long. There were several places in the story where it could have been resolved, but that was not so. Some of the descriptions in this book were absolutely unnecessary. However, it is a good book, and I would overall recommend it."
5,Loved it!,I'm a thirty something mom and I thoroughly enjoyed this book! What a great read. If you're looking for a happy distraction- this is it!
4,Fun retelling,"This took me some time to get into, and at 400 pages, I was worried I would be reading forever something I didn't love. But I had read Shannon Hale before, and knew I wanted to see this through because I generally like her, but I didn't feel connected to the story or Isi until she got to the city and became a goose girl. I ended up being really engaged, and I intend to continue on with the series, but I have reservations: I found some things predictable, but it was so in the way that fairy tales are, so this wasn't as much of an issue as it could have been. Also, I sometimes felt that the writing was a bit heavy-handed, if that makes sense. And as I said, it takes some getting into. But in spite of all this, I would still recommend it. There comes a point where the characters come alive and seem to come into their own, and that is enjoyable."
2,Story not engaging enough for me,"Summary: Ani is born with the ability to learn animal languages and her aunt helps her through her young years, but her mother the queen finds this animal-speaking abhorrent and ends up giving her daughter to another kingdom for marriage when she turns sixteen. Along the way her lady-in-waiting and her cronies mutiny so Selena can take Ani's place and become queen in Bayern. But Ani escapes and learns to survive by becoming the king's goose girl and befriending others.The Good: It's a cute story, clean, and has morals to teach, such as finding who you are. Ani is a strong character and so are the others that we meet. Shannon Hale writes this story well.The Bad: This just wasn't my style. I enjoy a good fantasy novel, but this one didn't hold my interest. But I can see why so many people like it. I just haven't found a Hale novel that I've really enjoyed yet."
4,better thesaurus than...,"I needed an electronic thesaurus for a third grader. I wanted to stick to the elementary dictionary to avoid words and subjects I wanted to avoid for a while. I ended up buying this thesaurus and the talking elementary dictionary and thesaurus. I found this to have more words in the thesaurus. It is inconvenient that you can only see one line at a time. I've tried three spellers now, and none found who for hoo."
3,Slow going (for me anyway),"Full disclosure: I'm not finished with this book yet. My last encounter with linear algebra was in 1978, so I expected some head-scratching. But it took me many hours just to get 25 pages into this book. Linear algebra is not Einstein science, so I was worried. I compared this book to my 30-year-old college textbook, and the college textbook wins. This book is lacking in examples. A theorem is presented, then proved, then given a reference number, and then pops up later by reference number, forcing use of many bookmarks.On the positive side, the price is a bargain. And, the translation from the original Russian is absolutely invisible."
2,"Basic, nothing exemplary","I was hoping that this book, ""A Case for Amillenialism"" would be insightful, deep and challenging. I also hoped it would be helpful in my own wanderings into Amillenialism and reformed theology and eschatology. It was merely a basic understanding, a good one but no more, and left me looking for some real substance throughout the book. There are some helpful tidbits, the scholarship is fine, but is very basic, undergrad, laymen material. So if your looking for a good introduction to the subject of amillenialism, this book is fine. If you are looking for a lot of depth, this book is sorely lacking in my opinion, especially in the section on the Olivet Discourse-Matthew 24."
5,very pleased,book arrived within a week and was in excellent condition. Very happy with the product.
4,Comprehensive effort to correct End Times Sensationalism,"Excellent topic by topic refutation of premillenial and post millenial errors. Very logical. Written for academic taste with lots of details before getting to punchline. Only technical topic failure is that author did not thrashout what is the ""time, times, and half a times"", the ""1260 days"", the ""1345 days"", etc."
2,"This series has two great CD-books, and this isn't one","This CD is just a series of animal noises. Useful to match the noise with the animals, but hardly worth $30. Bought it because it's part of the Mon Imagier series -- Mon Imagier des Rondes and Mon Imagier des Amusettes are GREAT. Buy them, skip this and Images From My Day. But, again, the good CDs are so well done that they're enjoyable even if you don't speak French."
1,HELP THE HARD OF HEARING,"I HAVEN'T ORDERED A JERRY LEWIS MOVIE YET. WHY???? BECAUSE WE ARE SENIOR CITIZENS WHO GREW UP ON JERRY LEWIS FILMS FROM THE 50'S AND 60'S AND I LOVED THEM. BUT NOW THAT I WANT TO GET A FEW OF OUR FAVORITES FOR OUR COLLECTION TO WATCH IN OUR LATER YEARS NONE OF THE MOVIES ARE CAPTIONED !!! I FIND THAT A LOT OF OLDER MOVIES FROM THE 50'S AND 60' ARE NOT CAPTIONED AND THOSE MOVIES REALLY APPEAL TO THE SENIOR CITIZENS OF TODAY, BUT WE ARE HALF BLIND, OR WEAR HEARING AIDS BUT THE AIDS DO NOT HELP AT ALL. WE NEED CLOSED CAPTIONING FOR US. I HOPE THE MOVIE MASTERS CATCH ON TO THIS AND REMEMBER THE SENIOR'S WHO ARE FROM THAT ERA.THANK YOU"
3,Not too crazy about this movie.,Quite literally I wasn't too thrilled with this movie. Not my cup of tea. Lovely cinematography though. I give it Three Stars
5,exactly what was expected.,this is a great product especially for those who want to show their pride or support for the U.S. AIR FORCE. and if your ordering from 3 by 5 flags then you can't go wrong it was well worth the price and it arrived so fast. i order this item along with several others from different companies and it arrived threw the us postal service at a standard shipping rate faster than the items that were order with two day shipping threw ups.
3,US Air Force Flag,"I like the USAF flag I purchased, it allows me to support the troops and show my pride in the USAF... Good buy..."
5,"Elegant, portable way to sync your Palm","Works as advertised. Wonderfully portable for sync use on more than one computer, or to plug in anywhere you need a serial terminal."
1,There must be a better vesrsion out there!,"I agree entirely with the above reviews. The transfer quality of this DVD is absolutely terrible, however the story is so compelling that I stayed with it.I thank the first reviewer for explaining at least one big gap in the story as recorded. It boggles the mind why MGM would cut the section described as it doesn't seem to have been a Code violation.Although I'd much prefer the original French dialog track with English subtitles, I thought the dubbing wasn't too bad, but it's lost in the poor quality of the audio which is heavily distorted in the loud parts.Given the choice of this version on DVD versus nothing at all, I'd say get this version -- however be aware that it has many faults and it will leave you wanting to find a better version.I rate the film 5/5 but this transfer 1/5."
5,emotional and inspiring,"Seller shipped item quickly and as stated. Love the movie, with an exceptional cast, which was both emotional and inspiring!!!! A must see and own."
5,Loved it!,This is so very pretty and complimented Forum Novelties Little Pink Princess Costume perfectly! I would definitely recommend buying to anyone looking at it!
1,too small,We tried this vest on 4 children and the only one that could wear it was our6 year old and she only weighs 55 lbs. The other three all weigh less than 75 lbs. and none of them could even get it on. This is a very poor discription on the actual vest and the children that it will fit. I would not purchase this vest for any child over 55 lbs.
1,Have a problem connecting this hose to the 6 Gallon Dura-Tank™ EPA Compliant Fuel TankPart #: 5008623,Have a problem connecting this hose to the 6 Gallon Dura-Tank Part #: 5008623I replaced the connector with a Johnson evinrude connector.
5,Quality Product,"Installed quickly on my grady white 3/8 hose bib. Quality construction, very soft, pliable and easy to prime. Definitely recommend."
5,GREAT VEST FOR A GREAT PRICE,PURCHASED THIS FOR ONE OF MY SON'S FRIENDS. THEY ARE BOY SCOUTS AND USE THE VEST A LOT. I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE VEST
4,bouchon,"Although i have not yet thrown Junior overboard to test actual flotation, this is a decently constructed comfortable vest that represents good value for price."
4,Good value,"Overall I am pretty pleased with the vest. My one complaint is that it rides up when I am seated in my kayak. I have tried snugging it up, but no remedy has been found. This makes it somewhat uncomfortable, but if you were seated upright, like in a canoe, it probably would be fine. For the price, I'm ok with it. I'm 5'9"" and 190 lbs. with an average build."
1,"Too Small, Poor Design","Even though my son is on the small size and closer to 50 lb, I should have heeded the comments of others. The design of this PFD is poor, rubs the neck/chin area - not comfortable for my son at all."
2,Purchased adult life vests.,"I purchased three adult life vests. The life vests are rated for only 90 lbs. The life vests are so small, they will only fit a child. I weigh 230 Lbs. My wife weighs 180. My son weighs 220. I notified Amazon.com that the Life vests were too small and needed a larger size. Amazon.com sent me three more Life vests the same size! Now I have six Life vests, that I cannot use!"
3,"Ok, but on the small side","My 11, 10 and 8 year old kids who are small and thin are a bit big for these. The width is fine but they seem short and look a little funny when on because of this. However, the price is good and if you won't be wearing them a lot they're probably ""good enough"" if your kids aren't picky."
2,Zipper falls off,"Poorly made - there was no stop at the top so the zipper fell off, making the vest useless. No pocket or secure location for key, etc. storage. I would recommend paying the few extra bucks for a little more vest - it's not like they will wear out quickly. You'll have (or be stuck with) this thing for years!"
1,This is really a BAD movie!!,"I've watched this one due solely to Wes Craven's name being associated to this one. After all, the guy is a master of the horror movie craft.Man, what a DISSAPOINTMENT!!! This is one of the worst horror movies I've ever watched."
1,Could have been better..,"I just saw this movie. It was funny and scary. It is a bad 80's 'B' movie. The actors acted like they were going along for a ""dead end"" ride. The audience was there too; knowing it all along. That's scary! Wes Craven should have known better. The studio should have known better. They could have made a great film. The ending was uneven and dissapointing. If at first you don't succeed...no more sequels!!!"
2,Not what it could have been,"I agree this movie pretty much sucked but Craven fans should know the facts before they start raving about how low he went on this film. Wes owed Dimension one more movie and that ended up being Cursed. Now what we have here isn't even that film he started to make. Craven originally filmed most of this movie in an almost entirely different version that Dimension decided they didn't like because it was a HORROR movie and wasn't hip and funny enough. That's when Kevin Williamson rewrote the script to be this piece of poo that we all watched. So Wes had to re-shoot the movie to suit the new script. Basically he hates it, and his new movie coming out, Red Eye, is for I believe Dreamworks pictures not Dimension.Thank you!!"
2,Marginal howler lacks bite,"Largely formulaic film which features OK as well as sub-standard SFX, (though Rick Baker involvement). Apparently film maker Wes Craven wasn't pleased with this outing either, but that is another story. Nothing new here, though some OK scenes and decent camera work occasionally shine, (such as the opening scenes). Overall I found it rather boring and not scary. Though not a total loss, this was largely an example of missed opportunities, further marred by a couple of lame sub-plots aimed at the young-uns. While this is no AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON or THE HOWLING, I would still recommend it for rabid Werewolf film fans. You certainly could do a lot worse."
2,Ginger Snaps was much better with 1/10th the budget,"Wes Craven was supposedly unhappy with this film after fights with the studio, rewrites, re-shoots, etc...It shows in the final product.What starts a an interesting film erodes into Hollywood formula mediocre hash.With less than 1/10th the budget, GINGER SNAPS was a much better modern pop-culture Werewolf film.It's a shame this movie could not have been made right... it showed lots of potential, but it jsut didn't come together successfully.When watching the movie it almost feels like 3 films edited together as a last ditch effort to get it released as the mood changes from serious horror, to camp, to silly stupid comedy (werewolves holding up middle fingers and similiar infantile jokes), etc..Would have been good if done in one continuous serious style of horror all the way thru."
3,"The Good, the Bad, the Stoopid","The Good: There were some good points to this movie. I did enjoy watching it. I thought the acting was fairly decent and the story played well.The Bad: Cheesy werewolf. Looked like a ticked off teddy bear that needed a bath.The Stoopid: I thought this was a ""serious"" werewolf movie, as serious as the genre can get. When the female werewolf flipped off the main characters I thought it belittled the otherwise decent story."
2,Werewolf Cheese....,"Two siblings are bitten by a werewolf after having a car accident. Suddenly they go from geeky to cool... With some unexpected side effects: craving for blood, unsightly body hair and the curse of lycanthropia.Cursed was a strange film. It tried hard to be a 'hip teenage horror film,' but failed. Then it tried to be a romance. But that also failed. Because of its PG-13 rating it was neither horrific or... very good. There were a few laughs here, but nothing significant.2 stars for a few good scenes. Not memorable in any way."
2,Pretty Ordinary,"I didn't feel this movie was anything special, no surprises plot wise. There were a couple of times when I jumped back a lil bit but overall I didn't feel this movie was worth the time or money."
1,Worst movie of the year. And that's when I'm being nice.,"Once again, Craven proves his worthlessness as a director. He's had, what, 400 movies? 3 good ones? Tops? This movie is so bad, you can't even make fun of it. It follows every stereotype of crappy horror movies ever made. This is not a horror movie. This is a badly made comedy. However, since it didn't mean to be funny, it's crappy. I also saw and hated Boogeyman. Boogeyman is Gone With the Wind compared to this piece of monkey feces. Don't waste 100 minutes of your life. There are better, more entertaining things to do - like watching paint dry, watching an episode of Days of our Lives 30 times in a row, or just sleeping."
3,Good film! What's to complain about?? Enjoyable!,"After I heard a friend trash this film, I didn't bother to go see it in the theater. After it came out on DVD, I rented it with low expectations. Right away I liked it and couldn't understand why I'd heard bad reviews from friends. I am sure I lowered my expectation once I heard the bad review, but even considering that the bar was lowered, I still enjoyed it and think you will too. Now a bad film is ""Urban Legends 3: Bloody Mary"". Wes Craven did a good job on this one. Not at all disappointed."
1,I DONT WATCH AMERICAN IDOL,KARAOKE IS COOL THOUGH.... i thought it would be karaoke... THE MUSIC IS HORRID no DImmu borgir WHAT... I AM GLAD I RENTED THIS JUNK PILE.
3,What more do you want for $20 bucks?,"I bought the American Idol game a few days ago from a local electronics store, and to be honest, the game wasn't too bad. Perhaps I was not expecting so much from an inexpensive game, but overall it was fun to play. I mean, what more do you want for $20 bucks?"
3,The Flake's Progress,"Honest flakiness is better than ersatz flakiness (e.g., Garden State); it can generate flashes of humor and charm. But it can't sustain a feature-length film, and these ninety minutes of fey inconsequence pass slowly. Compare this movie to Napoleon Dynamite: a clever paean to oddballs made by shrewd and knowing people, versus a twee little valentine to misfits made by a fellow-traveler."
1,low budget amelie,"I don't undestand all the raves this film has gotten. It's creepy, and very poorly made. Why does the performance artist like this newly separated shoe saleman? What's so great about her performance art tape that makes is something a contemporary art museum should show? Is it her buying a pair of pink flates and writing ""me"" and ""you"" on each toe in black Sharpie? Or is it the collage of photographs she made? It's purportedly about people trying to make connections in today's world...but I think most people do a lot better than emailing 5-year-olds about sharing their poop (back and forth, forever), or putting up signs on their window stating all the lewd things they'd like to do to underage girls.Not even close to funny. Maybe it was trying to be quirky and cute like Amelie, but really, this was just...boring. Ridiculous."
1,miserable people with miserable lives,"Others have found this movie intriguing if melancholy. I found it totally miserable as well as exploitative. It has that ""indie"" feel about it with characters that are supposed to be ""quirky"" and a little off-center. In this case, they are so far off center as to be dangerously deranged. The ""hero"" celebrates his divorce by setting his own hand on fire. Nice! His neglected kids, one a young teen and the other barely out of kindergarten, get involved in sex chat rooms with deviant adults. The ""heroine"" is supposed to be a talented performance artist but when we get to see her art, it turns out to be garbage. She falls for the hero for no apparent reason. He brushes her off; she persists and they end the movie clasped in an embrace that looked to me like the grip of a python around its prey."
1,Maybe the worst movie ever,"This is the first movie i've ever reviewed. Maybe the worst I've ever seen. Bought it in the cheap entertainment pile at a grocery checkout line due to the 'awards.' Watched it. Had to write about it. Where are the child protection people when they're needed? Surely the dialogue and actions the childern were directed to say/perform violate more than just the bottom level of taste they occupy.Is there a joke somewhere that i'm not in on? Did people actually vote this movie honors?Underage oral sex? Kiddie anal sex and poop dialogue? A humorous pedophile? This is a sad, sad movie. The parents who let their children perform in this travesty need to have their butts kicked.If this trash is what we reward, we are near the 'tipping point' and the slope down the other side looks steep.There is much to pity here."
2,Okay,"Just as ""arty"" and vague, precious and inessential as I suppose I expected it to be. At the same time, there is certainly a market for this kind of thing, I'm just not it. Make sure you know if you are before buying it. Pity that I had to order it from overseas before watching it (our DVD selection in South-Africa is, shall I say, bog-standard)."
4,Beautiful and contemplative,"From the cover of the DVD, to the bubble-gum sets, to the art design, to costume design, MYEWK is rare, as it is a visually innovative, American film. I was ecstatic to see a film fall away from the mundane cinematography that is making all contemporary Hollywood film blend together like a closet full of beige suits.Even more impressive than the well thought out design of the film was the contemplative script. Although at times it becomes cheesy and slightly self-indulgent, there is plenty socially relevant exploration for the view that endures the occasional flight into capricious thought."
1,"Stinks worse than Elizabeth, NJ!","Beware! Under it's genteel appearance of mid-list lit lies a boring pot-boiler that bludgeons the reader with a wide array of cliches and deus ex machinas every other page. It's the sort of plot-driven drivel that one knows was made flesh from an unsold screenplay.Nice grasp of geography, if that means anything to you when choosing a book."
3,hard to set codes if you need to change allot,"con's take allot more time then other keboxes to set different codes all the time (for nightly rental situations)pro's great for room compared to others, only one ive found with enough room for key and keyfob"
1,shoddy thinking,"The author believes that France's economy, and socialism generally, is admirable. This, against all evidence to the contrary. Really, how much more of this sort of wishful thinking masquerading as economic analysis are we expected to take? Haven't we had enough demonstration of the falsity of these ideas? As socialist economies drag their shuddering bulks to standstills while the people riot (and rot), we are expected to heed calls to admire, and replicate, their failures. Amazing. Read Hayek. Von Mises. Sowell. Friedman. This guy, here, should never have been published."
4,A page turner,"The plot was very believable. It was a very quick read. I enjoyed much more than a Tom Clancy book. Go ahead, read it.. You'll definately be entertained."
1,Doesn't work with Edge,"Although the description says this cable works with all Visor handhelds, the cable does not fit the HotSync port on the Visor Edge. It's a different size. I found this out the hard way."
1,A BIG WASTE OF MONEY AND EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING,You would be better off buying the separate cards than trying to download any of their titles off their site. I purchased the speaking Spanish English download and was unable to copy it to the card. They were very slow to respond when I e-mailed them and I've had no help after 2 attempts.
4,Excellent View into pre-album Santana,"I got this two CD set just to see what the cover of ""With a Little Help from My Friends"" sounded like; it sounds like Joe Cocker's version, but the guitar/organ work on this track is awesome. After listening to both CD's, the music grew on me and I couldn't listen to anything else for more than a week. Disc 1 contains three future popular Santana charts in Jingo, Persuasion, and La Puesta De Sol-aka Fried Neckbones. Disc 2 is titled Santana Jam, and that's pretty much all you have to say about it. The CD contains some great guitar, organ, and latin percussion features. Overall, a great buy for a low price."
4,Great!!,We love PFR they are one of our favorites. They seem to get their influence from the Beatles. They are a great Christian band.
3,To be honest...,"this is probably not worth the money, now that I have used it a while. and I got it for a good deal at the time too, bought at amazon, referred by www.whosave.com. so here it is:the good:for a huge display, it's light and thin too.fast processing inside, if you ever need it.lots of connectivity options, bluetooth wifi irda, CF slotthe bad:very pricey, but it is top of the line...bad touchpad, need to adjust it for different usesthe screen has trouble with some color which causes glare when playing video.the battery life may be an issue, when i use frequently, I need to charge every 2~3 days.In the end, I feel that this is too expensive for what it does"
5,worth the money,"""this is hands down a wicked radio"" thats what i have to say i had this radio for a year and it was flawless the default screen on the radio and disc screen is a tad boring but to must distracting and good for you anyway only bad part is the radio is discontinued and it will never see navagation :( but to make up for it the DVD screen quality is great!"
2,Cheap Trick got a paycheck for having the very fine Mandocello on this compliation. That and R.E.M. is all that worth listing to,Mandocello finally gets SOME star billing.Too bad it on here. Poor Cheap Trick!
3,Boring is not so bad,"Boring is not so badThe title of this book is missleading. ""Jewish literacy"" is not acquired by reading the machinations of halachic detectives or humdrum pedants and heavenly caretakers. Nor is it acquired through the unquestioned participation in thousands of years of tradition. This is not a book to be read from cover to cover. It is a colorless reference volume in encyclopedic format lacking in dimension. This book will collect dust until you suddenly need some basic facts or a review of same. It may be worth picking up a used copy if you need a facsimile of (orthodox) Jewish facts within reach. I do not mean to imply here that religion is ""factual""; inasmuch if you cozy up with this one then you are really in trouble. For this purpose one could go much faster on line."
4,Nice survey,"This book is intended for people, Jew or non Jew, to whet their appetite into the vast storehouse of Jewish history and all things that pertain to Jews in literature. I thought that it was (tob), good. The vastness of our history and literature is beyond reach in this life time. So, suffice to say, their exist certain fountains of knowledge such as this book that helps us mere mortals gain a foothold into our past. I want to say that this book could be used like, cliff notes, but that would trivialize the Rabbi's hard work. Nay, this book is needed and handy for a quick glance into Judaism past it is well written but like all surveys it makes you desire more.It's a must have.Shalom"
4,All Consuming Images,Comprehensive reflection on how our self-image has evolved (devolved?) over the decades. Thorough and insightful. An easy read despite its length.The book seller was 100% efficient. A totally satisfying experience.
5,the kids loved it!,As soon as it came out of the box my two kids just loved it! It's soft and is so big that both kids (they are young) could both lay on it.
5,great cd!,"This CD includes most of Louis' greatest hits. From St. James Infirmary to Hello Dolly to Tiger Rag, this CD is a must to have. Louis Armstrong is the best jazz musician ever, I believe, and no one can have enough of his cd's!"
3,too small,"I got these steps for my mother who has three yorkies. She said that the stairs are a bit small for them, that they don't feel comfortable climbing them. Maybe they have to get used to them. Otherwise, I'd recommend getting the next size up."
2,The scent is overpowering,"I have never been sensitive or allergic to smells, but the scent of this moisturizer is so strong and overpowering that I had to wash it off because it was making me feel slightly nauseous. I wish I had listened to some reviewers from other websites who warned that Aubrey Organics products can have a very powerful scent. Now I must admit that they were right. I also bought Aubrey Organics hairspray and deodorant, and they also smell very strong. If you are sensitive to scents (or not accustomed to unusually powerful scents), you should probably think twice before buying products from this company.I am also somewhat ambivalent about this product containing Padimate O as the active sunscreen ingredient. There is some controversy about the safety of Padimate O and other PABA derivatives. Unfortunately, I happened to read about it after I purchased this product."
2,Not What I Expected,I thought I would be getting a gel solution. Instead I got liquid only. It was not what I wanted or expected.
5,Truly Cooling when kept in the refrigerator,"In preparation for summer, this seems an essential product. Not only will Aloe Vera heal the skin, it presents a cooling alternative to heavier creams and lotions. This is purely Aloe Vera with citrus seed extract and vitamin E for preservation. You have to keep this product in the refrigerator after opening. Which is great because then it is always cold.Because this is so natural, the product is somewhat liquid and a little goes a long way. The consistency may vary, but the one I received looks just like freshly pressed aloe vera and this could be added to homemade beauty products you are using soon after you make them.The high absorption of this product is impressive andthere is no sticky feel. You can use it as a coolinghand moisture treatment and seconds later, all you will notice is your skin plumping slightly and feeling smooth and very soft.100% Natural Ingredients~The Rebecca Review"
5,Light and silky,"This is one of my two favorite moisturizers ever (along withAfrican Shea Butter Creams 16 Oz. (100% Pure & Raw), which I prefer to use at night) and I love everything about it... its ingredients (Aubrey Organics has signed the Safe Cosmetics Compact), the fragrance, how light and silky it feels, how easily it's absorbed, how little is needed (even in my very dry climate), and that it's cruelty-free (no animal ingredients and no testing on animals). I've used it for about four years and when I gave a bottle of it to my 71-year old mother to try, she fell in love with it immediately. It definitely seems to work equally well on a variety of skin types, and though it's perfect under makeup, I prefer to wear it all by itself!"
3,Programming!?,"For a book with programming in the title there is precious little programming in this book...The editorial review from Book News, Inc has it right: this is a general MIDP information book. If you are after a book about how to program some MIDP specific features you will not find it here. Contrary to the other reader's review there is actually little low level technical information.No treatment on general programming tips either, for example, why threads are more important in MIDP wireless programming than traditional Java programming. Or how to change your style to be less Object Orientated for speed and memory efficiency (Nokia forum has good tips on these areas).In short, good review but bad for programming."
4,J2ME in a Nutshell,"Programming Wireless Devices with the Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition is an excellent one-stop shop for everything related to the current status of J2ME.If you've read the CLDC and MIDP specifications and want to know more, this is the book for you. This book is suitable for project managers, team leaders and developers. It has a good mix of high-level architectural discussions and low level technical detail to keep all readers interested.Due to the immaturity of the CLDC and MIDP specifications, don't expect this book to be the final word on the subject. I would expect to see more developer-oriented books to appear once J2ME has gained a wider audience.Overall this is a very readable book that comes highly recommended."
4,MC 5 - 'Ice Pick Slim' (Alive),"Never knew this three track CD compilation was actually an {extended} CD single. Giving it a four-star rating because the sound quality is pretty darn good. Each cut is from a different show the MC 5 played sometime in 1968 at the Grande Ballroom in Detriot. ""Motor City Is Burning"" is your typical live MC 5 cut, as the eighteen-minute title track ""Ice Pick Slim"" is exclusive to this release (well, until last year or so when they put out a box set) serves as a lengthy 'odds and ends' piece (sort to speak) with vocalist Rob Tyner on flute and John Sinclair on sax - an awesome 'open jam' - likely improvised as I've never heard the Motor City Five perform anything quite like this. ""Mad Like Eldridge Cleaver"" is nineteen minutes of a blues jam but more song oriented. These tunes were mastered off the original 7"" tapes. Recommended."
2,I was very disappointed in this unit.,"I was very disappointed in this unit. I was going to take it on two-week trip, where the eight of us could save all of our pictures, and review them in the hotel during the trip, and burn a DVD for all at the end, but after discovering the following deficiencies, I threw it in a drawer instead: (1) power brick and cables were almost as large and as heavy as the unit itself, (2) the unit took 5-7 seconds just to display the next picture - making quick review very frustrating, and (3) the video cable for displaying on a TV did not work, or just barely worked if one jiggled it and held it out 1/16th of an inch and applied pressure - either a defective or poorly designed cable/plug. I'd expect this from a $5 pair of cheap headphones, but this unit cost me almost 600 dollars."
4,Book for teens,"This is a really good book, but I would seriously recommend you reading it before giving it to your child to read. There are VERY adult scenes (very descriptive birth scene, for example)."
1,Cultural Revisionism,John Collis who is British is engaged in politics in this book. Many anglos in England have never been fond of the ancient celtic traditions and heritage of Britain. But now with the Celtic people of Scotland and Wales embracing their Celtic heritage and Celtic culture enjoying a revival like that in Ireland before her independence from England many in England are engaged in a campaign of cultural imperialism to try and damp down the growing Celtic revival in Britain.This book is part of that campiagn.
5,"Excellent DVD, fast shipping. Great seller",Excellent DVD. This is a retail DVD in like new condition. I would recommend this seller to anyone that might be looking for a Title such as this one. Thank You !!
5,"Scary, because it could happen","Of all the end of the world / nucular attack movies, this one is by far the best. Jane Alexander gives the best performance I have ever seen in my life. Showing her running through the house like a maniac, looking for her son's teddy bear. So she can bury him with it. Unlike other pictures, there is no buildings or cities blowing up, just people. This picture summed it all up. Nucuelar war is not about cities being destroyed. It is about the death of our children."
4,"Talks too much, says too little","I cannot say the book has no value - it contains a lot of interesting stuff which I enjoyed reading - I learned many new things. What annoyed me much was the extra autobiographical content that was totally useless to me. I didn't want autobiography, I wanted popular science book. IMHO, the book's content could have been delivered in half of its size. It's nice sometimes to have a little ""behind the scenes"" stuff, but this book certainly overdose it. However, although you might complain the extraneous content, the book is well written. You won't be bored."
4,Nice Flatware!,"I was hesitant to purchase this set when I saw some negative reviews, but was pleasantly surprised that this flatware set is nice! It has a nice weight and a classic look. I am enjoying!"
2,"Bloodhype, it's all Hype!",What a disappointment! I just started reading Alan Dean Fosters Flinx in the Commonwealth collection by getting the first book free on my kindel. I found it very entertaining until I got to Bloodhype. It seems Foster had a short story and wanted to sell it. He decided to add a Flinx in as a very minor character in the background and a few more pages. Great! I can make it one of the commonwealth series!The book in poorly written and you can foresee the ending in the beginning of the book. It's just plain boring. I feel ripped off! If I had not all ready bought Flinx in Flux I would have discontinued reading the series. I will see if that book returns to the fun adventures of Flinx and continues me in reading on.
3,LA Law - We Need it on DVD,I used to stay up until 3:30 am in the morning to watch LA Law for me it almost became a religion. I hope that they release all season as a box set since I know people who watch it saw the whole thing so a box set would make the most sense.
2,Good for ... less than 3 months,"The slippers looked good when I got them and still do after more than 3 months of frequent use. However, the initial snug fit is now very loose. Very loose! More annoying, the bottom lining has separated and is crumpled up near the toes. Using an inner sole helps, but for the price, that really shouldn't be necessary."
4,Its a slipper,"What more can I say it was good made and it s comfortable and was received on time, Sole is good for walking outside also,"
5,Perfect,These are great shoes. Very comfortable. I was looking for a slipper that would be rugged enough to wear around the house and for short forays outdoors. This slipper definitely fills the bill.
3,Need half sizes.,Last time I bought LB Evans slippers I was able to get size 8 1/2. This time I bought size 9 at Nordstroms and they were too big and they didn't have any smaller sizes left. I looked on Amazon and found size 8 and 9 but no half sizes so I bought size 8. The size 8 is a little snug but I decided to keep them since it appears the LB Evans company no longer makes half sizes. Too bad.
1,dont buy it,"I bought this game, and like others, couldnt get it to play. Just error messages after a lengthy download, and then when it doesnt work you're left to dig all the files off your hard drive to save space. Save your money and pass on it."
3,Chet Baker Silent Night,Just not up to the usual Chet Baker standard and on most of the songs didn't even sound like Chet Baker.
2,Disappointing,"There is little on this subject, at least in English, and I was hoping for a much stronger effort than this volume. Perhaps for $25-30, it might be worthwhile, albeit flawed, but for $50, definitely not. The illustrations are few, and not well reproduced, the maps are actually too numerous, yet a mix of good, and amateurish, and there is a distinct lack of personal accounts. It is a dry recounting of the eventual failure of virtually all of these poorly trained, and I surmise, poorly motivated combat formations. I applaud the author's intent, but not his results. One would be better off with the old Osprey title "" Luftwaffe Field Divisions"" , for much less money."
3,boys and girls together,"It has been almost 30 years since I last read this book- to my surpirse and contrary to some reviews, I don't think that the story is dated. In the seventies, it was recommended reading to students by high school psychology teachers.The book is excellent; however, as far as quality goes, there are a number of pages (maybe 30 out of 750) that are very, very pale and difficult to read so I am disappointed as it is a book that I will reread over the years."
3,it was better when I read it at age 16,"I remembered loving this book when I read it in high school. however, almost 20 years later (and much longer after it was written), I didn't feel like the book had held up. The characters remain unique, and the dialog solid, but the plot and characters where much less compelling than I had remembered. The authors introduction was defiant, but I am inclined to agree with some of the reviewers of the day; it's just okay. Goldman has much to be proud of in his ouvre, and Boys&Girls fits somewhere in the middle. It's a coming of age story set half a century ago with themes that are still relevant today. The execution of these themes feels less novel - and it may be because when I read it first, it was the first book that dealt with such adult ideas that it was new to me. Unlikable characters result in lukewarm interest on the readers part, and that in the end is what I took away this time"
4,Very relaxing,I really like this video. I have fibromyalgia and this type of yoga practice is very doable for someone with physical limitations.
2,"Good, Bad, and Ugly","If you want the Queen you know and love and you are not a FANATIC, stick with the Greatest Hits I & II as a better two disc set. The live versions of your favorites leave a lot to be desired on this set. The way this live album was recorded really doesnt do an justice to the vocals. At some points they can hardly be heard, no matter how loud you turn up your stereo. Bohemian Rhapsody is one that comes to mind as lacking the quality of vocals it deserves (""I see a little silhuetto of a man... CANNOT BE HEARD). I bought this before the 2 disc ""hits"" set came out because this was the only set short of a box that had all my favorite songs. Let me just say, now that you can make a choice between the two, dont go the same way I went. Before I end this review, let me just say that the instrumental work on this is great, but it doesnt make up for the poor recording. Good luck."
3,a good jumping off point,"I use this book with non verbal students who use adaptive equipment to cook. I like the way the pictures break the sequences down very specifically. It helps me to remember not to assume the stove temperature or the step of ""turn the stove off"". My frustration is with the use of name brands as visuals and in the written text. By using the specifics, it requires the user to modify the recipe before using it with students (if for instance you don't have ""butter flavored"" Crisco).In my classroom we incorporate switch practice with highly motivating activities to move toward advocacy. The Visual Cookbook provides me with pre-printed, step by step directions for activities that we can easily set up."
3,Special Effects Book,"Great book for the novice entering into the world of Special Effects Makeup. Some easy, cheap gags that will get you started without breaking your bank. Good starter book."
3,it is an ok book for starters,I felt this book was not worth the 40 bucks we paid. there is a lot of remedial stuff in it. very basic and some not very professional . Definetly a book for a quick halloween gag or something. A couple of decent ideas but I think I would have rather spent the money on Savini's book.
5,Amazin,"Like the tittle, i was AMAZED before the first time that i read one page of this book, is incredible, if you want to learn and you're an amateur makeuper THIS IS YOUR BOOK!!! Get It!"
2,A bit of a dissapointment,"After reading a rave review of her live performance, and hearing that Sugar Pie is Natalie Merchant's favorite vocalist, I thought I'd give this disk a whirl. What I found was a voice past it's prime, and some spectacularly bad song selections - some clearly out of her range, others that would sound awful sung by choirs of angels, Ray Charles, Kiri Te Kanawa, or any other singer living or dead. HOWEVER, there is one absolutely essential cut on this outing, and that's ""I wanna Know"". This version is dead, dead, dead on. The woman who sings it is not just interested in knowing, she's entitled to, in a cool, firm, steely way. I'd almost buy more of Sugar Pie, in spite of the dissapointment of the other cuts, just to look for more of THAT."
1,0 for 2 - Not a high quality television,"When I set up the TV the remote didn't work and the indicator lights on the front of the TV didn't illuminate. So I exchanged it for a different one and the second TV is worse, because it loses the programmed channels once it's turned off. I don't have faith that a 3rd TV will work properly, so I plan to ask for a refund.There are other odd things that happened such as...We tuned the TV to a station, but only saw a blue screen. We decided to leave it on that channel and after 15 minutes the channel suddenly started working. When we turned the TV off and back on again, it was back to the blue screen.The one positive thing was that the picture (when the TV actually worked) was nice."
1,OOOPS,"I was very excited to find a 9"" Color TV available, that said, imagine my disappointment when I plugged it in and it didn't work!"
2,"Coby CTV 101 9"" Color TV","The picture on this TV on several channels was to dark to see the peoples faces. This is after we had brighten the picture as much as the TV would allow. Some of the channels were ok, but the main channels we watched were dark to see."
3,Song played during candlelight dinner,"I was also interested in the song that played during the candlelight dinner. I was disappointed when the soundtrack was only a score, but I did some checking around and that song is by Jimmy Eat World. It's called ""Hear You Me."" I hope that helps everyone else that was wondering about it."
3,Good description of torture,Good description of toruture and how events took place and why. I think it should be a necessary reading material for all members in the intelligence gathering and military field.
1,"Horrible, made me want to vomit on the author","only Noam Chomsky could be more anti-American. go on, all you Death to America wackos, keep hating the greatest country in the world. Answer me this: if were so terrible, how come everyone one and their mother literally risk their lives trying to get to our shores?every single story in this book takes an anti-US slant. Its so one sided its ridiculous. You almost wonder, is he living in the same country that we are? His distorted views, re-written history, and ""facts"" are so skewed that only a naive imbecile would believe it, or those already drinking the kool-aid would welcome it. unless you hate this country, do yourself a favor and stay away,"
4,ripped,"cover fit my grill very well. seems to be of durable construction. cover ripped when i was putting it back on in the winter, and in a rush tried to pull it down while it wasnt properly lined up, so a corner of the grill ripped the outer vinyl. im pretty sure this wouldnt of happened if i had taken my time, and if the cover wasnt so stiff from the freezing cold. overall good buy for the price,"
2,grill cover,Only had about a month and it is already tearing along the bottom. Inside of cover is a nice felt backing with velcro straps though.
1,Terrible Quality,"Was completely disappointed with this product. Bought it with the Broil King Signet 90 on the recommendation of Amazon, received it promptly, but when I went to put it on the grill for the first time it ripped in 4 spots. Complete waste of money. Cheap vinyl plastic coating on the outside that has no durability at all. Do not recommend this product at all."
1,how to build everything you need for your birds,"I was extremely disappointed by the very limited information in the book. There were just a few simple drawings on some aviaries with no fresh ideas or insight. It is a waste of time and money. This book is not recommended to anyone. It is not even a book, more like some photostated scraps of paper bundled together with a cheap cardboard cover."
4,Useful information,The book is a collection of drawings and text. I have already built four next boxes according to the drawings.
1,Save your money,"A disappointment, I expected a book that would be informative and up to date. Most of what is contained in this photocopy, stapled together ""pamphlet"" is either general knowledge or can be obtained from the Internet. For foreign purchasers, please note that all measurements are given in Inches and feet and may be a problem if you work in Centimetres and Meters.Buying publications Internationally is an expense exercise and you would be doing better to invest your money in some other publication considering the price."
5,southern fiction at its best!!!!,This author is great! I have read all her books except Whistle & I just bought it. Her dipiction of the south is the best. Her characters are very believeable. I would love to know them. Please Ms Daugharty more books with the same theme as your previous books.
4,When Movies were Movies,"This is a wonderful old movie. In those days, the subject of pregnancy before marriage was so taboo! She plays the part of a slovenly housewife to the hilt, Burt is her stuffy, overbearing husband, ashamed of her, but all they have been through together wins out in the end."
1,little sheba,not this either beecause i did not like it one bit i am not showing know body or at all.
1,DVD,This DVD did not work. I did not send an email to this person because I did not even watch the movie. I put it in one day a year after I watched it and it did not work. Very disappointed!
4,Difference in quality from Amazon & Wal-mart,"4 stars for quality of denim and fit and stitching.....When I read the reviews on Wal-Marts website I was really disappointed that so many people had said the sizing was off and that they shrunk at least 2 sizes in the wash. It was recommended that you order them 2 sizes bigger. Our local Wal-mart does not carry them at the store which prompted me to look elsewhere.The reviews on the Amazon site were quite different & most of them indicated sizing was true. I ordered my husbands 1 size larger just to be sure and they're perfect.Oh, He found a little secret pocket in the bib somewhere and is thrilled. lol, He wears his overalls very, very often and I'm tempted to get him a lil train conductors hat!"
4,ok,Got what I paid for. Not real think material. I would buy again for the price.Sizes are what they say.
2,not small,"not sure what everyone else is talking about. These do not run small. i wear a 31 or 32, and i got the 32 waist and it is gigantic on my. previous reviewers must be some heifers.i got them for a halloween outfit, but didn't even wear them because they look too big and silly. maybe for painting someday."
2,"Pretty, but misleading","I bought this after looking at the description and reviews on the website, but had no clue that it is essentially a date book with pictures of textile arts and very short passages (generally 2-4 lines) about making things scattered throughout. I was expecting something more along the lines of essays, or longer daily chunks - a book rather than a non-year-specific calendar. I have no need for a date book, so this will be going back to amazon."
5,Groundbreaking video ethnography,"Tobin's book has been around for a number of years now. Nevertheless, it continues to set the standard in the creation of video ethnography. Graduate students across the nation use this book for its brilliant methodology and for his insightful readings of culture."
2,What ? Huh . . . . ?,"It's just too bad the natives only had stick cameras, they probably could have done a better job. I watched this movie because I wanted to see what caused Dennis Hopper's demise with the studios after the success of ""Easy Rider"". Disjointed, boring, interesting somewhat, really bad lighting and sound. It's a star-studded borefest. Would be great if Mr. Hopper would re-release a new version that made sense. But maybe that's the point. I am grateful Dennis Hopper survived ""The Last Movie"" to give us what is, to date, a rich an entertaining body of work."
5,Now we know the rest of the story- Baseball,This book was thouroughly enjoyable. I enjoyed the insightsand the annecdotes. Good sports reading-
3,Needs Updating,"This is a brilliantly implemented tool for tracking and analyzing the various aspects of your health. emptysee's review expains these features well. A significant consideration: the program has not been updated since it's 1995 release. Although the interface is exceptional for a Windows 3.1 program, it could be polished to take advantage of Windows 95/98 capabilities. The food database is badly out of date - so much so that I find myself regularly having to enter new foods. Life Form does all the things it claims, has an excellent and thorough manual, and is highly customizable. I just wish the authors would polish it up and bring it up to date!"
4,Box of Frogs,"The trasnaction was wonderful, no problem with the seller in any way. I loved the music but my CD skips on the last two songs."
5,Much Missed American gem,"PLEASE BRING THIS OUT!!!Like 'Everwood' this is an American classic - great characters, chemistry, stories, humor etc & long before they made it big both Justin Long & Gennifer Goodwin star great little show with a big heart.Don't keep us waiting to much longer for the DVD's its a shame not being able to watch it!"
5,Get smart and buy GET SMART,"Get Smart was awesome. my whole family enjoyed season 1, now we are ready for season 2."
3,Maybe it's just my age...,"or that I've never seen this before so I have nothing to reminiscence over. While I found it sort of intriguing, I fell asleep watching it, it's rather dull."
3,Didn't Play,"I live in Australia and have bought DVDs from Amazon before and they have played on my DVD player and this one didn't. I was very disappointed I have to say. I can play it on my computer so I can see it, but that isn't the same as in the lounge chair with my feet up."
1,No subtitles of any kind.,"This is unbelievable. Most of the folks who would be potential buyers for this tv show are over 50 years old and no consideration for them at all. There are no subtitles, not even English subtitles. What a shame. I am returning this thing."
3,Some good moments,"Some say it is one of the best Queen albums, I say it has one of the best Queen songs. Innuendo and The Show must go on are really catchy and all-time classics, and this CD has other excellent moments, but not remarkable ones also, unfortunately. I'm going slightly mad, Delilah and Bijou are one of the band's worst songs ever I think. It's not Queen, it's something new, but not in the way like they did it with Hot Space, that opened new lines with better quality.It's a good work in complex, but not The Miracle of theirs, I think. Check out The Works, The Miracle, The Game, Opera and Races instead, their best."
2,buyer's remorse,"I'm a high school teacher and one of my students had a pen that I thought was the green one in this batch. It wasn't, but the green one wasn't a total bust. The lighter colors are very hard to see (the pink is impossible to write legible comments with) and the whole pack is more pastellish than professional. It's about a step up from a sparkly gel pen."
3,Lion Costume a Little Small!,"I agree with the other review; this is a cute lion costume but runs small! I bought it for my son, who is of average size, and it was too small! He ended up wearing it anyway due to not having enough time to send it back for the party he was attending, and it tore the first time he wore it! If you are of average height and weight you better order the larger/plus-size to be safe!"
3,Not really a cohesive effort,"With songs from the ""Highlander"" soundtrack, this lacks the usual cohesiveness of a Queen recording. There's no flow from one song to another except when they are from the movie Other than that, there is little underlying connection between the pieces. That being said there's still some fun stuff, like the over the top drive of ""One Vision"" and the Highlander numbers like ""Give me the Prize"" have that same gloss of hard rocking and over the top silliness that few bands can accomplish with such aplomb. A Kind of Magic is typical of many of Queen's later recordings, moments of brilliance that are not sustained throughout. It's definitely worth having but pales in comparison with the band's best."
2,(Mostly) bland euro-pop,"Essentially, this is the soundtrack to the film ""Highlander"" and provides a few strong tracks.""Who Wants To Live Forever"" may very well be Queen's most emotional song.This album becomes the first not to achieve an award for sales. It is deemed too ""Euro-pop"" to be a success in America.This had to have been true as this same album became a huge success through out the entire world and one if it's singles (the very pop ""A Kind Of Magic"") was a number 1 hit in over 35 countries!Sadly, this album contained too much pop oriented music for even my own taste and in doing so, is one of my least favorite records of theirs.At least the album's cover is fun and imaginative."
1,Not country,"She's terrible live, album isn't worth the money. Plus she's not country, so it's annoying how she's classified as country. She's about as country as Kelly Clarkson only WAY less talented. Kelly can at least sing."
1,Why do people find this music so good?,"Reviews are mostly, if not exclusively, written by fans of an artist. I am making an exception with this review. Ms. Swift is, by most accounts, a nice person. Her music however (regardless of performance flubs) is at best ""cute"". I can see pre-teen or even teenage girls liking this sort of material. They buy and Ms. Swift's sales go through the roof. She is a star by all rights. But let us not kid ourselves here. Take away her image and extremely aggressive marketing and what you are left with is only inspiring if you are not curious about music in general. Once you you listen to musicians with real talent, it is difficult not to feel sorry for people who will continue to listen to Ms. Swift."
4,controversy,"im partly disagreeing to the reviewer (R.PEREAZ) here. im a big fan of aguilera, keys, houston, fabian. But i think taylor will be even more talented when her vocal is a little bit more established and matured as she reaches 30. Taylor swift is more talented than most people her age and look at How many singers can write music, play guitar,are beautiful and have a personna like taylor at that age. There may be a few around, but very rare. Real talent is not just about amazing vocals. Look at lots of the amazingly talented indie rock bands out there, they put out and have created a lot of the best work in music, but a lot of them dont have amazing vocal. their talent lies in so many aspects of music and production."
5,Phenomenal Tour,This Tour was great in every single moment. it is like in one moment you have Broadway and Taylor Swift.
4,"Not bad, just one or two nitpicks...","I like Voltaire's art style, but I wish he'd gone with a more comic-lettering-type font when updating all the lettering, the old English font is a little jarring compared to the surrounding artwork. I also wish he'd kept the dialog balloons as-is rather than overlay them with amorphous whitespace for the text to live in. Other than that, I love the content itself. The same dark humor that permeates his music is showcased here.-- Ben"
3,Rethinking Kirghizstan & Uzbekistan,"My memory of this episode of Lonely Planet was pretty fuzzy. But following the events of September 11th, I wanted to see this because (other than the Pakistan episode), it's the closest Lonely Planet ep to Afghanistan.Okay so maybe there was a good reason that my memory was sort of fuzzy on this one. Honestly, it's really similar to the episode in Mongolia which also features Ian Wright, but it was still worth revisiting to see how the people of the former Soviet Bloc region are living.This episode isn't so much about the tourism and the sites you'd want to visit, but maybe more of a reminder of how people survive with very little and how much we honestly have in our lives."
4,Not bad.,It works well but is a little over priced. Haven't had any problems with it. I use it in the oilfield and it is still working well even after quite a bit of abuse.
4,Buyer Beware,I like the 4gb chip as it lets my camera keep taking pictures without stopping to transfer to my computer to free up room. I would have given this a 5 except for the fact that this is SD HC. The HC makes a world of difference. This chip cannot plug directly into my printer or my laptop as it requires the included reader. I just don't like to have to keep up with that reader when it could have easily plugged into my laptop or printer. No drivers seem to be available yet to update my laptop to read SD HC directly.
2,SanDisk Memory Card,"I bought the 4 GB Memory Card. I was a little disappointed because when I put the card into my camera,the camera gave me an error message that I need to format the card.I never had any problems with SanDisk Cards 2 GB or less. I suggest that you stick with the 2 GB card."
2,unreadable,"I normally love Pohl's work, but this didn't work for me at all. After fifty pages I started skimming, and after a hundred I gave up. I couldn't get interested in the characters, and the story was taking forever to get off the ground."
3,"""The Thinking Person's Independence Day""?!?!?!?","......which is what the cover brags.....Not true by a long shot! Interesting ideas are introduced, especially when the humans realize that the ""eschaton"" may be a false concept these aliens are basing thier conflict on...instead of assuming it is true...Pat is interesting, but Dannerman is a snore...As for the cover quote, ""Dopey"" is no Independance Day nightmare, just a simpering peacock with a kitten's head!!!!"
2,Very poor Pohl,"Although I haven't read much of Pohl's work, I LOVED the Heechee books. This book, however, was very, very boring. I forced myself to finish it just to see what happened... and nothing did! And now there's a sequel? No thanks."
1,Waste of money,"This book does nothing but blame the United States for all the problems in the world. It doesn't address the dictatorships, the political killings in their own countries. Some of this would actually be laughable in view of the bias shown if there weren't so many dead to prove thier own crimes."
1,"Leftist Trash, pushed by Communists","The usual tripe and garbage. Wah wah wah. USA is sooo mean. It's all USA's fault for. . .everything. Capitalism bad, communist dictatorships good. Waste of money."
1,Just another book bashing American ideas,Just another book trying to convince the readers that Latin America is a victim to American ideas. Thank God the book is in Spanish so Pres. Obama can't read it because he already is apologizing for the country. Wake up people.
5,By the same author....,"This book is great - worth the 5 stars - and others have reviewed better than I.However, if you are new to Galeano - I also recommendCentury of the Wind: (Memory of Fire Trilogy)which is a beautiful, easy read."
3,Latin American History From A Left Wing Perspective,"Mr.Galeano is one of Latin America's greatest leftist intellectuals. This book is a good read if you want to learn about how the left view's Latin American history. Like all books written with a bias it is witches brew of fact, fiction, and myth. Mr.Galeano is very much a leftist man of his generation though he said about Castro's Cuba "" I will repeat what I have previously said both on and away from the island: I do not and have never believed in single-party democracy (including in the US where there is a single party disguised as two) nor do I believe that the omnipotence of the state is a valid response to the omnipotence of the market. "". For scholars on Latin America this book is a must read just make sure you read more unbiased scholarly books."
2,Not Sure about this and the Amazon rankings,Bought the book after the diplomatic conference of the Americas. I am not sure about all in the book as I have never been to any of the countries. Just recently started reading about the history of Latin America. Perplexed is the word I would use after briefly reading a few pages. Seems as though there may be an agenda here.
4,"wake up and read something, ditch Fox news","It's a little bit tiring to hear the constant garbage/propaganda slung Chavez' direction. Dictator? No, democratically elected. Show me where he is a dictator. WE in the USA just got rid of OUR dictator, now THERE was an illiterate idiot who was NOT elected. Please, all of you so against Chavez - get thee to the nearest not-paid-for-by-corporate-interest news, like Democracy Now, read some real books on the true history of the world (not the ones you had no choice but to swallow hook/line/sinker in school). Chavez is a far better leader than Bushie boy could have ever been; the fact that he doesn't follow the US' best interest is such a shame, now, isn't it? Our boyz created this mess in the world, time to own up to it."
1,Save your money,"So you don't have to read the book, I'll condense it into 50 words or less.""In Latin America, we suck. It's not our fault, but we suck. The United States, Spain, Portugal, and Europe are to blame. We suck and there's nothing we can do about it. The only way for us to escape our suckiness is for the developed countries to stop giving us aid, stop buying our products, and stop having relations with us. It's all their fault."""
1,Whine. Blame. Whine.,"The mass media is having 'gams about the rise in ratings of this book due to Chavez giving it to President Obama.However, it's 317 pages of maudlin whimpering about how all things negative are someone else's fault. And Chavez feels the book is historical for his corner of the world. It's rarely a waste of time to read someone else's perspective of events, but this one is pathetic. Don't waste your $."
1,Biased and incomplete,"An attempt to justify militaristic socialism by blaming every ill in South America on the USA. How foolish: (1) populations are responsible for their own issues, not someone 1000 miles away; (2) Socialist governments are what private citizens run away from, not toward. This governmental style is on the ash heap of history."
5,"Enjoyable, engaging, informative, at times inspiring","In Civility In An English Village, William Stephens found an English countryside community where the children were well-behaved, school ran smoothly, there was no violence, people felt safe, levels of trust ran high, people watched out for each other, the medical care was better than that in America, doctors were unhurried in their time with patients, old people were routinely looked after by their neighbors and by the ladies of the village, trades people looked after their customers, men and women had a keen civic sense, the villagers cared deeply and actively about community affairs, treating their village responsibilities and concerns with the same dedication as they did their well-tended gardens. Enjoyable, engaging, informative, at times inspiring, Civility In An English Village also records British quirks and weaknesses, while offering applicable solutions to a great many of America's current social woes and problems."
1,Not worth the price,"Maybe worth 10.00 but certainly not 40.00, material of entire costume is extremely low quality. Not worth the price"
4,Great Action Movie With Unique Style,"The story of this movie is really good. The action is intense. The cinematography and sound are done really well and adds to the story.The only thing that bugs me is not knowing what happened to the nice family, it is the only plot hole."
5,"Not your typical Hollywood ""Action Thriller"" just cool......","At times a bit slow, but inovative and extremely artistic. If you're interested in a run of the mill ""action thriller"" you might want to pass this one up.This is cutting edge stuff......I enjoyed every second, from the creative camera work to a soundtrack which will blow your mind. There are a few weakneses for sure, but in general this film shines.Most of the negative reveiws seem to have a problem with new and inovative movie making....maybe in a few years they will come around!Not for close minded audiences...."
4,The most puzzling aspect of Hanna are the numerous bad reviews and low ratings it received,"I don't see how this film has received so many bad reviews from viewers.While it wasn't quite able to make the leap to ""outstanding"", Hanna certainly is very good, far superior to all those movies that are just a bunch of noisy gimmicks thrown together without much plot or thought.There may be a few plot holes, sure enough, but they can be overlooked. The story is still above-average and well thought out.Additionally, I didn't find it boring. The good writing, interesting characters and compelling situations kept my interest throughout the entire length of the film.If you're looking for an intelligent action film I recommend Hanna."
1,No Plot,"I borrowed the movie (Blu-ray version) from my cousin. I watched it to see what it's all about.The only story behind it: A young girl genetically enhanced is on the run. We never really find out why, but she is on the run from something.The action wasn't even spectacular. If you want action; look for Jackie Chan or Jet Li movies.Save 2 hours of your life and pick out a different movie to watch."
3,Hanna,"FREEWAY was the white-trash ""Little Red Riding Hood""; this is the Jason Bourne mix. The direction is a lot better than the logic-defying script: if you're going to go to the trouble of raising the perfect teen assassin, why would you keep her so shielded from anything modern that she's utterly incapable of blending in? You teach her 5 skillion languages, but never expose her to music? Whatever. The Brit vacation family is too cutesy and messes w/ the plot momentum. The big reveal is a big disappointment. The Big Bad Wolf character emerging from the maw of a big bad wolf is a big groan. Still, the actors and the director have fun with the silly script. Hanna's escape from the complex is a trippy stobe-flashing treat. The show-off tracking shot that ends concludes w/ a fight scene staged in a single shot is a refreshing change from typical action movie overcutting. Blanchett is very funny as the wolf. 6/10"
1,Don't Bother,"A waste of money and by no means comes close to the excellent action movie ""Columbiana!"" There is NO comparison. I read other reviews which enticed me to orderboth DVDs which was a huge mistake! In fact, I couldn't even finish watching it! Ifound it to be boring and a waste of film!"
1,Don't waste your time watching,"Eric Bana is not an action star, has no athletic ability and yet he somehow teaches a young girl how to fight?Saoirse Ronan did a good job of making it believable that she could fight and do all those amazing things, although not as well as Chlo Grace Moretz, better known as ""Hit Girl"".The dialog was done fairly well but was over shadowed by the comical fight scenes with Bana and the assassins sent to kill Hanna.Within ten minutes I found myself wishing I had not spent the money to watch this movie. A wannabe ""Hit Girl"" movie.Just my opinion."
1,Absolute garbage; how did it get such great reviews?,"As my title says, ""How did this get such rave reviews?"" Simply put the first part of the film is what you'd hope for--tense, action packed, and mysterious, a great setup that leads to...well, a movie so dull I almost fell asleep watching it. What little action there is amounts to nibbles spread out into a few fights and a LOT of chases; see Hannah meet people we could care less about, and see them die; see Hannah act with all the emotion of a robot. See the end sequence come and just END, no epilogue, no follow-up.Unless you've got insomnia and need something to put you out for the night? Avoid this like the plague."
1,Terrible,"One of the worst movies I have endured for quite some time. Don't fall for the 'perfect assassin' routine. It's not about that....at all. It's really a very, very, lousy coming of age movie. This girl was sheltered from the real world until the movie starts. After that, it's her confusion and lousy writing that make the movie. Please, do yourself a favor, don't waste your dime."
4,GREAT LOOKING ACTION-FILLED ADVENTURE NEVER LETS UP,"Saoirse Ronan is Hanna, a teenager raised in an isolated, frozen wilderness by her ex-CIA operative father (Eric Bana) who has trained her to be a superbly skilled assassin. When he sends Hanna on a dangerous mission across Europe, she is for the first time exposed to normal life -- and discovers a longing for human connections. But first she must unravel the puzzle of her past -- and that of her father's. Joe Wright directs this great looking, action-filled adventure that never lets up. Cate Blanchett co-stars as a ruthlessly persistent CIA exec."
4,HANNA,Great movie! I watched this movie the first time on the DVD format but I had to have it in the blu-ray. There was no hurry since I had seen the movie so ordering through Amazon and waiting a couple days was OK. Worth waiting for!
4,Entertaining enough,"A pretty good girl action movie with enough grit to keep it interesting. It is very well shot and edited, though there are enough holes in the story to keep it from being more than an entertaining evening's fare."
1,What a waste of time,"After seeing the movie trailer I thought this would be a great action movie, a fun Saturday night escape. Wrong. This movie was terrible. You want action? Watch one of the Bourne movies. This movie had a script that was heavy-handed and unbelievable. The few fight scenes were poorly filmed. The cinematography was sophomoric. How many times in one movie can you use the visual effect of panning around someone to show they are confused? The soundtrack? OMG.DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS."
3,Movie Good - Digital copy sucks,"The digital copy of this movie is not on a disc. It requires a download (1.74GB) but in order to download it you are required to install their ""download manager"" (at least for Windows media version). I don't appreciate having to install their crapware just to watch my movie. Then there is the usual downside of a digital copy - When you get a new PC all your digital copies die with the old PC, as they can not be transferred or re-downloaded to a new PC."
3,Somewhat disappointed...,"Honestly, the best scenes in the movie are in the trailers. I found the story pretty dull the rest of the time, and the story only implies what happens to the family that Hanna befriends along the way. Further, for the so-called genetic engineering of a soldier, she's remarkably bad at handling bad people."
4,Good movie,"Item arrived well packaged, on time and as described in the item description. Great quality and can easily recommend to others."
3,Beautiful scenery,"Beautiful settings and an interesting premise, but there was too much violence and Cate Blanchett's performance was TERRIBLE! (Amazing--I've never seen her anything less than great.)"
1,Bad Movie,"The preview was way more interesting than the movie. It's art nouveau meets bad music video meets cartoon chases set to music all with bizarre characters, none of which you care about. There is no building of the characters nor did the plot and historical flashbacks truly offer any substance. Save your money."
4,NOT SO CLASSIC...,"This album is amazing, but the horrible ""Sweet Lady"" keeps me away from giving it 5-star. Anyway, it's a remarkable piece of music who must be in any decent rock collection."
3,"Great album, bad vinyl pressing?","The three stars are for the bad pressing on I received, otherwise this great album deserves 5 stars through and through. My copy skips during the end of ""Sweet Lady"" (the best song on the album) which is very annoying. I'm not sure if all pressings are like this but beware when buying this gem on vinyl."
4,Religious Experiences,"When I first heard ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" it scared me. Heck, I was only 11 and I didn't understand how you could mix opera and rock. It sounded satanic. I've since resolved my religious issues and come to the understanding that Queen blew open the doors to numerous musical possibilities. The vocal harmonies, and learned, exacting guitar licks leave an indelible mark on your consciousness. Queen is definitely a band to learn from if you want to understand rock -n- roll."
5,"Like the Marx brothers film, a classic","The tapes are analog here, worn thin with the million overdubs and the songs are generally getting better. Highlights are The Prophets song it's the echoplex vocal orchestra of Mercury, underrated also is Sweet Lady and Good Company featuring May's guitar ""jazz band"" done with overdubs and a battery powered amp called the ""deacy""."
3,The album that made Punk necessary,"I enjoy parts of this album---the guitar solo at the end of ""Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon"" has a tendency to grab hold of my brain and not to let go, though I love actual music hall too much to enjoy the verse and the fake old-timey sound used.Still, I can't add much to the negative reviews here: pretentious, sententious, overblown, overserious, overdone....all-in-all, an adolescent's idea of what ""important"" means. I'll still listen, but will chase it with a shot of ""Pretty Vacant"" (or even ""Get Off the Air, Rodney"") to still my gut."
1,"Uh, no thanks","I'm sorry, but ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" has got to rank among the stupidest songs ever. It's pretentious, silly, and just plan makes no sense. It has everything to do with over the top self indulgence and nothing to do with the spirit of rock and roll."
5,Queen's Greatest Triumph,"It is easy for 11 of the tracks on this album to be eclipsed by the one that everybody (and I mean everybody) knows - 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. The fact remains that those other 11 tracks are just as good as 'Rhapsody', and the album itself is easily Queen's best. The styles range from all-out rock in 'Death On Two Legs', to skiffle in the brilliant '39', to ballad in 'Love Of My Life'. The talents of Brian May are showcased on 'God Save The Queen', where his multiple layers of guitar make for an original masterpiece rivalled only by Hendrix's 'Star Spangled Banner'. Freddie Mercury's love for the eccentric and ridiculous shows up on 'Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon' and 'Seaside Rendezvous', 'You're My Best Friend' is pure pop-rock, and there is nothing that can be said about 'Bohemian Rhapsody' that hasn't been said before. Prepare yourself for one of the greatest rock albums ever. God Save Queen."
4,i love it!,great color! a little bit watery. took my 2+ coats to get the solid yellow.but it came really fast and i love this nail polish!yellow is a must!
4,I want to Relive My Youth With Karla,"So like I bought this on vynal when it first came out. I'm 36...so get your butt back to the mid 80s when everything only SEEMED ok. I was going to Rocky Horror and Drinking Shooters. This was my pre-bar, post bad date, dance around the apartment record.....I'm SO psyched to have found on CD! Midnight Confession is WOW and Boy Talk is amazint"
5,time hasn't changed it one bit,"i signed up to be notified when they released it, bought it ten minutes after they announced the release date, and received it tonight. i've been waiting for this ever since they made DVD players.i just watched the first 3 episodes, and still think it is the best show ever.i still hate dianne, but other than that, it still makes me laugh so hard i can't see; but now i can pause it or watch it again. and again.WHY DIDN'T THEY RELEASE ALL OF THE SEASONS!? dangit.the theme could easily plague your sleep since it isn't cut out, so you hear it every episode. i'll be humming the cheers theme forever. other than that (and dianne), this is heaven.ya gotta love cheers!"
5,man needs his rocks,"Even if the book tells about a man who lived ages ago, all could've happened yesterday. If you find this book, read it - it opens an another door, once again..."
1,Kal's Magnesium Does Not Dissolve,"I have been taking a double dose of Kal's magnesium gylcinate for about a year and there was little change in my magnesium levels. I decided to test how well Kal's tablets dissolve in warm (~100 degrees) vinegar. After 30 minutes, the tablet was only partially dissolved. This is the same test that Dr. Oz suggested to determine how well a supplement dissolves. If the pill does not dissolve completely, he suggests looking for another brand. (See: [...] for details of the test). I have decided to look for another brand of magnesium."
2,Not actually reflective,"Fun, jagged shapes. But only reflective in the sense that they have a shiny coating and could catch a slight glint from a nearby light sources."
5,Another good educational movie for toddlers,My 2 and 3 year old kids absolutely love it! It appears to be a little old but the kids don't seem to care much.
4,Probably best for 3+ year olds,"My near 2 1/2 year old likes this video more than I do, probably because I was expecting something different based upon previous reviews I read. There ARE a lot of trucks shown, but some of it is quick footage, and there is also a share of non-driving footage that makes my son say ""scoop truck, Mama, scoop truck!"", meaning he wants to see TRUCKS--not surveyors, the control room of a gravel yard, or several replays of a hill being blown up. The music is also corny and somewhat annoying for adults. Having said this, I must say the video is educational and probably best for a 3+ year old who understands more of the narrative."
1,Still waiting for response from Sperry,"Had it for almost a year before the leads have gone bad.It worked great up until then.So it gives inconsistent readings.Sometimes it works and sometimes not..I contatacted Sperry's customer service and left a message 4 days ago.I don't think their going to call back.So I will try again.Tried their e-mail address and its not going through.I will let you know what happens.I own a clamp meter from Sperry for over 10 years with no problems what so ever.I keep both of them in same pouch and they still look new.It's most likely just a defect.I just hope they do the right thing.Even states on their website a lifetime warrenty.Just to let everyone know this not a Amazon problem.It's Sperry's responsibilty.Have to say Amazon has always done the right thing by me if I did have a problem..Thats why I constantly use Amazon.Again,I hope Sperry does the right thing here."
5,Almanac Fan,I have bought the Almanac every year since 1980 and every year they get better and better expanding with worlds of new information.
5,monkey mania,"My 4 yr. old has loved monkies since 4 months old. She has been hooked on them particularly the hoodwinked ty beanie baby. I cannot stress how much she loves them and how happy she is to get a new one every Christmas from Santa. We retire them yearly, she carries them EVERYWHERE! They get filthy! They are durable enough to wash, so we do then put them in a box. Buy him and enjoy!"
3,Guilty pleasure ...,"Not that bad.I honestly thought that it would be a whole lot worse.Heck, I've seen a lot of zombie movies & this one was just fun.Cheezy & cheeky."
5,Super Price. Great Service!,"Fast shipping, super service, great product at the lowest price. Feeder works great. Thanks."
1,Equity by La Crosse,"Tried to replace an old Equity clock that was similar because I loved it. This one not so much. Numbers are harder to see, the backlight doesn't light up like the old one, the temperature gauge is way off, and the automatic time change for daylight saving time didn't work. Ended up just keeping it for traveling and camping, both a different one from ABC warehouse for under $5."
4,You cant go wrong with Peanuts,You can't go wrong with watching this from the good old days when kids only know about simple things not bad things. I still watch them till this day. Great price as well.
1,junk,"This kit is cheap and flimsy and the instructions and pictures for usage are incorrect. Usage of this kit will lead to a failed installation and at that point will be impossible to return since you've already used it and will not be in saleable condition! The vendor who sells this probably knows this and yet still caries this piece of junk. Schoce makes a superior product which I bought locally after many attempts to use the junk kit, the schoce kit was a one shot outstanding results installation!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Great Singer - Not the Greatest Song Selection,"I agree with the reviewers here who do not like the song selection.Shel Silverstein's 'The Ballad of Lucy Jordan' is a standout here. Much of the rest is very middle-of-the road, but I'm giving it 3 stars for Bobby's singing which is still great."
4,Really enjoy this show,"Warehouse 13 is light, silly, and fun, with enjoyable characters that aren't too deep. This show isn't for hardcore sci fi or fantasy fans, but if you just need a brain break, you'll enjoy it."
5,One of my Favorite shows.,"Can't wait for the next Season to be available. Can't believe a watched them all thus far. Great ideas, keep them coming."
5,Now we're happy with our puppy!,"Santa brought the Yorkie to my 6-year-old daughter for Christmas. While it was as cute as could be, it didn't work well. It would rarely kiss, and, as other reviewers have noted, the velcro on the belly wouldn't close. ""Santa"" returned it to Toys R Us and got a new Yorkie. This one appears to have some modifications, compared to the first one, to facilitate the velcro staying closed. The ""new"" puppy is a kissing fool!! She works just beautifully and is so much fun. My husband and I enjoy it as much as my daughter does. This is a cute, fun, enjoyable toy for children of all ages. If you get one that doesn't work to your satisfaction, keep trying for another one. It's too much fun to miss!"
3,tense thriller not mant people heard of it,I remember i saw this movie years ago on T.V. and never heard of it.It was advertised as from the director of halloween so i thought i check it out and it was great.Typical carpenter about people from different backgrounds stuck on a diffuclt situation with great action and acting from a bunch of no names.I recommend it highly.
2,"Strictly a B movie, prolly B minus.","Face it fan boys, if this didn't have the name 'John Carpenter' there'd be nothing to love. Everything about this movie is sub par. That's not always a bad thing though. Most B movies are sub par and some of them are great anyway. This one isn't great though. It's barely watchable though and so it gets two stars. MST3K would have plenty here to make fun of. The bad guys walking around as if in a trance, the cheesy synth soundtrack, the horrible script, the lackluster acting, and the unbelievable premise, all conspire to make this a B minus movie."
3,Assault On My Senses,"After seeing the re-make, which I enjoyed, and reading the reviews for the original, I decided to take the plunge and buy the original, which received higher feedback ratings. I was disappointed. The original plays like a B Movie. While some of the acting is okay in the original, and the stories closely resemble each other, the script and action are simply not as good or come across as realistic as the re-make. I'll leave it at that."
2,Disappointing...,"I bought this DVD because of the overall good rating and because the plot seemed like something I would enjoy. But man was I disappointed! I guess beauty really is in the eye of the beholder because I saw very little in this movie that I liked. It's predictable, cliche, and poorly acted. For me, the movie jumped the shark when 2 of the prisoners had to decide between themselves which one would be the one to flee for help. How did they decide? By doing the old ""One potato, two potato...""! Ridiculous! And as another reviewer mentioned, there is a scene in which the female lead gets shot in the arm and doesn't even flinch - no change in expression, no nothing! She simply calmly fires back (and naturally, kills the villain)! Stay away from this movie, unless perhaps you're a hard-core B film buff, or if you have 90 minutes of your life that you want to give up."
4,Repetoire vs the sicilian,"An advanced book on combating the sicilian as white. It is impossible to come up with a comprehensive book on the open sicilian in less than 300 pages, but the authors do a reasonable job. Not an easy book to get through, but if you are willing to put in the work, this is a rewarding book."
1,"Good Album, Bad CD","The album itself is great, but like everyone else said, the stereo only plays out of one ear. Attain a copy someone else"
3,Great Sounds for One Ear,The Lyrics and beats on here are great. The style is one of a kind and a great listen to my left ear. I have a problem that I was blessed with two working ears and only get to hear the music in one. Post if you have the same problem because only one other person has the same problem and it is a majior problem. CD is still a must for any hip hop head or collector but hard to get a full feel out of one ear
3,"If you like statistics on academic programs, this is for you","Suffice it to say that I already knew more than this book could tell me, courtesy of 3D Artist magazine, 3D, Digital Video, and the internet. Au states at the outset that the book only addresses academic educational programs-i.e., semesters, quarters, admissions, registrars, matriculation, baccalaureate degrees -that lot, rather than the highly-concentrated, intense immersion training offered at training centers such as NYU's CADA or the Renaissance Center in Tennessee. the book doesn't mention either one, and omits many programs, for example, in my geographic area. Nor does it offer any plain-English assessment of the programs it does cover."
1,It's a bootleg,I'm not sure how you might feel about such things but just wanted you all to know that this is a BOOTLEG. An un-authorised release. None of the musicians involved will profit in anyway from this release.
4,Great CD.,"Nearly every song is addictingly pleasing, and you'll be sure to listen to this CD many times before you finally can get bored of it, if it all. The lyrics don't disappoint at all, either. My only complaint is the length of the CD, as I prefer my albums as long as posisble, and the weakness of one or two songs."
4,Gets you moving,"The vocals and overall tone of this record is kind of goofy, but the songs are great and get you moving. Great pop songs. Stupid haircuts. Weird vocals. I am dancing just thinking of this record. My only gripe, like I said, is that it is goofy sounding. Hopefully they will harsh it up a bit next time. Still good. And I dig the organ or keyboards or whatever."
5,hot hot heat is smokin'!,"this album is very deep, very hardcore.. one reason i really love hot hot heat is because they keep everything so up and happy, they've very upbeat... yeah. my personal favourite on this album is 'In Cairo', its such a great ending and i love the feel to the music. go buy hot hot heat now!!!"
2,"next, please","After a few listens to this CD, you realize its probably one of the more annoying things you've heard in a while. Their EP is was actually OK, this is just a mess of a pop album. It has maybe one or two really good songs on it (No, not now) but besides that, the rest just put me right off, from the cheesy dance-able pop-isms to the singer's grating voice, to the half-baked songs, don't bother with this. I have no idea why this band is so hyped. Go pick up some XTC or Cure albums instead."
2,Come On Hot Hot Heat,"Although I could listen to the song ""Bandages"" until my cd players wears out, the rest of the album sounds too similar to ""Dexy's Midnight Runners"", you know, the ones who sang Come On Eileen back in the 80's..."
2,Renaissance Records doesn't strive for sound quality,"I really want to buy this, but I'll save my money and find a good sealed vinyl copy and make my own since mine will probably sound better than theirs anyway. Renaissance Records will release a record using the worst source material. and call it a remaster. Some of their CD's are nothing more than vinyl rips and I've heard they'll even use a cassette tape if they can't acquire the original master tapes. Don't know about this one but I've bought enough of their CD's to know it's a gamble. The last one I got only because I forgot to check the record label. It had a ""Finger nails across a chalkboard effect"" I got a headache that stuck with me for a couple of hours. Only listened to two tracks, I had to turn it off it was so bad. If you get this and it sounds OK, you might not have as good luck the next time."
3,Christian Life,"This describes a Christian lifestyle. It gives practical guidance in commitment to Christ, a body of believers and work. Written by an ordained minister."
5,They Have Rocked Us!,"This CD is essential to all Queen fans. With the exception of the tracks off The Game, the singles Body Language, and I Want to Break Free, this represents the hard rocking Queen complete with the opera-style vocals. It features not only the hits like ""We Will Rock You"", ""We Are the Champions"", ""Somebody to Love"" and ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love"", but more obscure songs like ""Don't Stop Me Now"", ""Now I'm Here"", ""Save Me"" (although a hit in the UK), and ""The 7 Seas of Rhye"". If you were a fan of early Queen, you must own this. Then grab Classic Queen to appreciate their later efforts!"
5,Worth the $,"I am not the biggest Queen fan, however, I have loved this album for years. I never bought it before as the price was too high. I used to have to borrow my brother's cassette....I am VERY happy to have found a digital copy for such a great price! The download was very fast and there are no problems/issues/glitches with it. Highly recommended."
1,Not what I really wanted....,"I asked for Queen's Greatest Hits Vol. 1 for Chrismas and this is what I recieved. I wanted the CD to replace a very worn out tape from 1992. This is NOT the same thing. If I had known that they had changed the order and the songs I would never had asked for it. I want a CD that has the songs exactly like the tape...no extended versions...the right songs...Where is Under Pressure? If you just want a good compilation of Queen, this is okay. If you are like me don't bother."
4,"bohemain rhapsody, anyone???!!!!","ok, so i actually didn't even realize that a lot of these songs were by queen, i only realized that he had 5 songs i knew were amazing, so i figured the greatest hits might have more. and then to my utter surprise bohemian rhapsody wasn't on here!!! uhm, everyone and their mom knows that's like the BEST song. just ever. and it's been like 30 some odd years, and i'm not near that old. how did it not get on here?! it's ridiculous in how good it is...i assume it has to do with that pesky other cd i saw on amazon entitled greatest hits II by queen. so buy this one and then go download bohemian rhapsody, although i can't imagine you wouldn't already have it"
3,Playing w. the music purchaser,"It wasn't til after I bought this that I discovered it lacks Queen's greatest hit of all time: ""Bohemian Rhapsody."" And it's not like this came out before BH was a hit. Didn't realize til after I bought it that ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is found on one of the other 2 Queen compilations. Do you think that, perhaps, the record label *intentionally* left BH off to make music buyers hungry for buying the compilation that *does* contain BH? Think they might have been playing with listeners & duping us into buying yet another CD? Think they had this strategy all along? Naw. Couldn't be. They wouldn't do that, would they? Knocked this down to 3 stars for this very reason."
5,This album was terrific,"I immensely enjoyed Queen's Greatest Hits and listening to fantastic songs like Bohemian Rhapsody and We Are The Champions as well as Killer Queen and many more.All of the songs, even the couple I rated lower than the rest, demonstrated what a fantastic and beautiful voice the great Freddie Mercury had, and what terrific guitar skills Brian May had, and still has.Two songs in particular - Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy and Seven Seas Of Rhye - didn't do much for me, but I still feel this collection deserves a five star rating because Freddie's voice was so strong and powerful in every track."
3,What the Hell?,"Ok im a big fan of Queen,but this cd is missing some breakthrough songs here. The most noticable of all is""Bohemian Rhapsody."" In my eyes,that IS Queens' best song,and its a rip NOT to be on this cd."
3,Where is Bo Rap?,"Great collection from my favorite rock group of all times.However,leaving out their greatest classic,BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY spoils the picture.That wonderful track was on the original '81 release and it is on their Uk Greatest Hits .Why was it moved to the album named Classic Queen?A commercial move on the part of Hollywood Records to sell Classic Queen?Maybe.Still,worth buying."
5,Great Album,"This is the complete Queen album. I'm going to type a quick review for this. Its truly the best of Freddy Mercury and Queen. The only song its missing is Bohemian Rhapsody, but other than that, great album. I don't recommend buying volume 1 and 2 i only recommend that you buy this album and possibly download Bohemian rhapsody off itunes or whatever music store you use."
1,Not impressive,"Ward is Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford University. But I'm not impressed by his reasoning, because no amount of argument can defeat science. As Galileo said, the Earth moves around the Sun no matter what we think. Religion - not just Christianity - is incompatible with science and therefore religion must be superseded. I see no room for both. Nor do I see any need for room for both."
4,Good,This book is good for anyone struggling with a death in the family or one of there friends. I liked it but it wasn't my favorite book in the world. Just would definitely recommend any other of John Green 's books because they are fantastic. Very well written. (:
3,a good dose of reality,"3.5 stars - Green did a good job of creating relationships between the characters and I had a few theories as to the ""before"" or ""after."" I wished I had been wrong. A smart book but one that left me a bit remorseful wondering what my impact on people might be. Alaska was true to her character to remain impulsive throughout the novel, and what that means for all of the people around is not always the easiest to experience."
5,Indescribable,It really changed my view on life. John Green is amazing!!! The novel is indescribable. This author never ceases to write a outstanding novel.
2,I didn't feel the apex of the story was really an apex.,"The book flowed like a news report. Not alot of feeling was felt for the characters, you just never really knew them. There were no troughs and peaks through the story, and the ending was left open. Sure I filled 4 hours of time.....wasn't worth the price."
5,Excellent,This book had me paying attention from start to finish. it addresses important topics and how different people deal with a situation.
4,Meaningful.,"At first, I wasn't sure I'd like this book, and I actually stopped reading it about page 50 and didn't pick it up again for another year. When I did, I read it all in one sitting, realizing my mistake. The character's were amazing, believable, and easy to relate to. They also had distinct personalities, and showed real emotion, which was the heart of this novel. It was hilarious, of course, but also sad and disturbingly touching. I loved the ending, becuase it left you with a laugh instead of a tear.Pudge was a great narrator, and I loved the Colonel as well. Alaska was an interesting and disturbing character, and even though I didn't relate to her or like her that much, I still felt for her, which is saying a lot."
5,Lovely,"Don't be fooled into thinking that because this is story full of teenage mischief that it is in any way a simplistic novel. The pace is masterfully managed, the characters's personal details are carefully exposed and the delicate balance between joy, sadness, introspection and adventure typical of teenagers' minds make this a very fun and engrossing read."
3,Wished we knew more,"I wish we would have had more information all together.More about alaska, what happened that night, more in general"
3,Good but not great.....,Good but not great.....Looking For Alaska (Printz Award Winner) I actually am now reading the Katherine's book I like it much better. I bought All of his books because he attended my daughters college Kenyon College! This book being award winning I was expecting more. Once the Main thing happened I found it to be overall slow and silly.
5,I really want to fangirl over this one,"John Green is awesome at exposing different and hard issues facing the world today. This book would have to be one of his best(tying with The Fault in Our Stars). The characters are beautifully written and I feel like I know each one. Trying to figure out who you are is something struggled with by everyone. John Green does an amazing job exploring this theme. The hard moments are broken up with funny ones soon after. You feel all the confusion and pain experienced by Pudge. This book ranks up with my top 50 favorites (please don't ask me to narrow them down from that!). This book is awesome, I highly recommended, this would be a stupid one to pass up."
3,Don't look,The book is not as good as was initially thought. Finished reading it regardless and did pass it on to a friend to read.
4,Buy it while you can,"I find the mastering of this disc to be very listenable when comparing to my original vinyl pressing. I know that most folks buy this for the hit single that got lots of airplay ""Such a Woman"" but my favorite track on this is ""How long""...it is just plain a great tune that got limited airplay in it's day but is every bit as good as Such a Woman. I would bet this will never see another printing once this is OOP since the new generation of music consumers care little for sonic quality and are content with 128 kbps mp3's played on a portable device. Renaissance has been criticized for the mastering of some of their titles but I do not find that the case with this disc. C'mon the price is right at $5.99 and free shipping to boot. I bought this years ago with the 2nd disc and don't let the fact that it is no longer included affect your decision. I have NEVER listened to the 'bonus' disc anyways and paid more for it at the time....."
4,TO HELL WITH THE DEVIL - ORIGINAL ALBUM,"THIS WAS THE LAST GOOD STRYPER ALBUM...THIS REVIEW IS FROM THE ORIGINAL ALBUM WITH GATE-FOLDCOVER THAT WAS BANNED SHORTLY AFTER IT'S RELEASE...I AM NOT GOING TO ANALYZE EACH SONG...IF YOU LOVE OLD STRYPER, THEN YOU WILL BE HAPPY WITHTHIS ALBUM..."
4,the album rocked,i think that stryper was a great band.i wished they would have stayed around in the years. to hell with the devil proved a point to america.but they turned they're back on them. in god we trust was great. the yellow and black attack my favorite song was all of me.it was so beautiful it made me cry. against the law i didn't like that one. soldiers under command rocked. in the world today. we need stryper to rock the planet once again
1,"The worst insult to the term ""metal""",This has to be the biggest joke in the music industry. Who ever buys this so called band's music is missing numerous screws up there. Christain metal is the #1 oxymoron of all time. All i have to say is this. SLAYER RULES!
2,"it's ok, but black sabbath is much better",i would recommend you save your money on this album and pick up dio or marilyn manson instead. they rock harder and their message is more positive.
4,"Weebles Wobble, but they Don't Fall Down!","I hate to be nit-picky, but the newer, featureless version of the Weebles just don't have the same charm that these older ones have.We inherited a couple of older Weebles (5 years old) from my niece and the kiddo loves them, but the newer ones lack the cast features. Instead, they are smooth, like eggs, with printed features. Not as cool, not as interesting. After searching thrift stores, flea markets, eBay and yard sales, I finally found this set here, through a third-party seller. These are vintage 2006, which is why they're a bit pricey. As the adage goes, they just don't make them like this anymore. Love them! The mirrored one is a bit odd and we wonder why not a dwarf or a Prince Charming instead, but the wobbling and spinning are what the kiddo likes, anyway, and they do that, so everyone's happy."
4,Prism fans have been waiting for this.,"Prism is a classic group from the late 70's and early 80's with a smart sound. This is a compilation CD from many of their albums. I did not care for the music from Prism's Beat Street album as much as the rest of the CD. Japanese Girl is a classic 70's style tune which reminds me of Styx. It's Over, Take Me Away, and Coming Home will bring back the nostalgia of this classic group.We can hope that the record company will re- release all of Prism's albums the next few years. This is a great album for Prism fans."
3,Astronomy for the layman,"The title of this book has been changed at least once as evidensed by the sticker over the old title. I believe the title should be changed one more time and the book moved into another category. The ""an agnostic's view"" portion should be changed to something like ""An UFO theorists view"". I agree with most of the writers opinion but felt that I was simply reading an unqualified opinion. The few pages actual dedicated to Astronomy were interesting and showed me more proof on the lacking knowledge of the religious beginings. Anyone believing aliens played a hand in mans beginings or would like to learn more on this theory, should definately give this book a try."
4,it was great,I enjoyed was great. i like books where people get what they dish out. i read most of this authors book and this one is one of my fav's.
3,~ Don't Judge This Book By It's Cover ~ !!!,"This was NOT at all what I was expecting....When I first saw the cover for this book months ago...I couldn't wait for it to become available.....B/c....After reading ""Walk Like A Man"" by Laurinda D. Brown...Which was off tha chain!!!....I was expecting for this to be equally as good...But, it just didn't grab me like her other novels have...I mean it's an OK read but....It's not a book I'd want to re-read again..."
2,"sorry, but not their best work","Yes, yes, this is the band getting deeper into the funk, but Speaking in Tongues just doesn't work for me. For one, the vocals (on most of the cuts) are muddled and mixed too low for my taste. Couple this with the fact that the melodic hooks aren't there as they were on their first three masterpieces, and Speaking in Tongues falls apart."
1,Big Disappointment,"I was looking forward to this CD so much, but when I got it, it sucked because they cut off the best part of Bohemian Rhapsody, the main reason I wanted it. So be careful when you buy the CD, because they butchered it."
3,Love those Carol Decker vocals!,"Not bad for a one-hot wonder - ""Heart and Soul"" isn't the only winner to be found here. Not just for ""'80's music"" fans (count me out!), it's got top-tier vocals by Carol Decker throughtout. However, really, there is a lot of mediocrity to it, although it's generally better than most of the hits that ate up so much radio airplay in the '80's. Glad I bought it - very adequate, better than Bangles."
2,Bad Guy,"This is a pimp story in Japan. However, it is unrealistic. It insults intelligence of college education that The Girl has. She goes through Stealing(greed), Loan Shark (torepay the stealing amount of money), and Hooker ( to repay the high-interest loan).Her reason: To avoid going to jail. Her decision: To sell her body (a virgin). And the ending is far from real: To fall in love with a pimp who drives a van selling sex.All in all, the theme is basically wrong. Stay away for good."
2,Am I looking for something not there?,"As the other reviewers make clear, this is a disturbing film in that the college girl forced into prostitution ends up by developing feelings for the man who ""ruined"" her. So you may immediately assume that the director has a deeper comment to make beyond this trite observation.Problem is, having just watched the movie, I am not convinced there is anything below the surface. Prostitution is a fact of life in Asian cities, the theme of women overcome by their desires and in thrall to strong men a common one, and I searched in vain for any subversion of or challenge to that fantasy (as fantasy it is).Is this any more than a homage to the inutility of futility? Not that I can see."
2,Bad guy not bad movie just indifferent one,"One of those Korean director Kim Ki-duk's mannerist-minimalist films in which his raw brutality outweighs his workmanship. Basically, the plot has the title's Bad Guy (a brutal street pimp, actually), that is attracted to a pretty college girl sitting on a bench in a park. But college girl is not attracted to Bad Guy, who, by the way, never talks in the whole movie. And college girl already has a boyfriend. So, through a complicated scheme, Bad Guy is able to have her work in his brothel. Poor college girl is now a prostitute. But Bad Guy continues to be infatuated with her, and sees her work through a one way mirror. And this infatuation will let college girl eventually get the upper hand and (sort of) get even. Not exactly bad, but neither one of Kim's better films, who has done better than this (see instead Spring, Summer, Autumn... or 3-Iron)."
5,I love it,This base works with the Discovery infant car seat. We now have one extra for our other car or for when Grandma stops by. I am so happy to have an extra base for our little boys car seat.
5,A British Henry Mancini,"If you like Henry Mancini, you might like Ron Goodwin. I purchased the CD for Skiffling Strings only but I like the rest of this double CD set too."
5,Star Trek Voyager - Season Six,"Seasons 5 through 7 are the best of Star Trek Voyager, in my opinion. The characters and the overall story arc are very well developed by this point. The quality is also exceptional - especially in this particular season!"
4,No Postcards or Telephone,"Jesse MAlin is breaking ground rapidly.I felt that this single is a great buy - not only for the avid fan but for those new to the hauntingly brilliant artist that is Jesse Malin.ALthough I feel that this would certainly be a supplementary buy (in addition to his debut album ""TFAOSD"") it would never the less be a worthwile one.Wendy is one of the stand out songs of the albums as it rocks hard and fast all the way through - with enough cutting lyrics and broken hearted and abandoned sentiment to warrant the cynical growl.Death and Glory forms part of a tribute (which also was the name for the tour in honour of The Clash lead Joe Strummer) which is both fitting and beautifully performed.However it is the third track that makes handing over the money completely worthwile - the 3 Martini Lunch is a Graham Parker cover but words cannot describe the pain, misery and beautiful storylike song structure.Trust me on this one."
2,Gave up after 150 pages,"Tim certainly starts well -- I read FACE and his collection of short stories -- but he seems to end up padding the novels (FACE) and then just ending them without tying up the loose ends.DESOLATION started out really interesting, but then nothing really happens. And then nothing really happens. And then it takes 10 pages for a character to leave the apt and walk downstairs and outside...and nothing really happens. So I started skimming. Then skipping pages. Then I gave up about page 150.I think Tim's short stories/novellas are great because they are more or less ""short"" and it seems he feels the need to pad the novels to make them longer. At any rate, I'll keep ""trying"" his books because I think sooner or later, he'll hit a home run."
1,yikes,"In their pursuit of achieving God's design for their marriages, I would hope that readers would not follow the book's outlines alone. This book is dry and quite frankly, very open to misinterpretation which could be distructive to a marriage."
5,A Laugh Out Loud Must See Indie,"This movie had me laughing from the very beginning all the way to the end. The cast has a great chemistry, and their interactions with each other and with the auditions are worth watching again and again. If you need a good activity for the night for yourself or with friends then this movie will fit the bill perfectly. A great commentary track makes it even better to own for your second or third (or fourth or fifth) time watching it. BUY THIS MOVIE!!! You won't regret it. Special thanks to Indie film makers who make great movies like this and who make the film industry better all around!"
5,One in a million,"Well I just have to say my dads book is living proof of everything he has overcome and acomplished. I am his biggest fan and I can't tell you how proud of him I really am.He is not only the best dog trainer and breeder in the world today but he is also the best dad a kid could ask for.Thank you dad, you are so important to me. I love you, Rachelle Leann Gould"
1,Terrible Movie,"I am a cyclist and have been hearing about Graeme Obree for years. I am in awe of his physical accomplishments and understanding and sympathetic to his manic-depressive illness, as I have several family members who also suffer from this terrrible disease. I read the book The Flying Scotsman and loved it. I then eagerly looked forward to the movie for months. It was awful. One of the worst movies that I have ever seen and it is such a shame, as Graeme Obree is truly a remarkable man."
2,Poor Movie Making,I race a bicycle and so it wasn't hard for me to enjoy the movie simply because of its' content; however I was deeply disappointed with the quality of the movie making. Poor lighting and sound quality were the bigget annoyances.
5,Must see for cyclists!,Great flick to get you pumped for cycling. Goes to show its not the bike but the engine that makes the difference. :)
4,"Ok books, but mostly for older kids","These books are really for somewhat older kids - maybe 4ish. My daughter really didn't care much for them (she is 17 month old), even though she is a big fan of George!"
1,Less than 30 Days from Expiration Date,"This is a good marinade in my experience (acid content notwithstanding) but the batch I just received from Amazon has a *Best By* date of 4/5/2008, less than a month after I got them."
3,Consistant with vol one,"This book was about what you would expect .... if you liked vol one, you will like vol 2 .... same will hold if you didn't like vol 1"
1,Very Brittle,"Initially this product appeared to be excellent. However, within two days of very gentle use (desk to coat pocket) the casing started to crack. Within 4 days, the back have had crumbled and had fallen off."
1,wrong region,"Not sure about the ""all regions"" listed for this product. I just bought one and it won't play in my dvd player. very disappointed. love the series, wish I could view this movie...."
4,"A little overproduced, but still good 80's hard rock.","""In God We Trust"" was Stryper's third full-length album, and their fourth record overall. Following up a successful platinum-plus effort like ""To Hell With The Devil"" is no easy task, but Michael Sweet & company remained undaunted. IGWT actually sounds rather overproduced, a little too slick, as the band co-produced this album with Michael Lloyd, who had produced many pop records before, but this was his first hard rock/metal record. But then again, a lot of hard rock albums released during the late 1980's were overproduced. Yet this does not make IGWT a bad record at all. Some outstanding songs include the title track (inspired by 1 Timothy 6:6-10), ""Always There for You,"" ""The Writing's on the Wall"" and the two ballads ""I Believe in You"" and ""Lonely."" While IGWT may not be as good as THWTD or ""Soldiers Under Command,"" it is still a very good record in its own right."
3,"OK, but not memorable","Andy Pyle (only remaining original member on this recording) hyped this as being ""Argus for the 90s"" when it was released. Sadly, it lacks the magic of Wishbone Ash's most popular album. It's not bad, but after multiple listens I just find it kind of unmemorable, although certainly listenable. I would recomend ""Bona Fide"" as a significantly better late Wishbone Ash recording."
5,Absolutely Incredible,"One of their best records! And that's saying something from such a great band! This album marked their return to a more classic style-straight out rock music, with the very talented Roger Filgate accompanying founding member Andy Powell on guitar. Excellent collection of songs-my favorites are On Your Own and Top Of the World-and one great album!"
5,great product for a even greater price.,high quality and great customer service. i recommend these guys!
3,Charlie As Queen,"""Guitar Hero"" is worth the price of this album. It's "" Ziggy Stardust"" with more schmoltz, awesome guitar work and the amazing vocals that make Charlie unique. Like Queen, you always know who it is when your hearing Charlie. Take a chance on this album, as obscure as the band has become there may truly be no second chance for ""NO SECOND CHANCE."""
4,Very good concert but...,"The concert here is very good with good versions of Fish's early solo and Marillion tunes. Kayleigh and Lavender here and they will be highlights of any set they appear on.The but: The language from the stage. Definitely R rated and if it were sold in USA would definitely merit a parental warning sticker. If you have kids or anyone that would be offended by frequent cursing, don't play this within earshot of them."
5,Lovely,"Beautiful paisa music from rural Puerto Rico. Very soothing and peaceful to listen to, put my friend's baby girl right to sleep. Enchanting!"
4,After Two Weeks,"Well for me there has been little difference noticed in two weeks but then I might need to keep taking the product for a longer period of time. For the past two weeks my flow has been easy but not full. Where in the past it has been on again and off again from day to day, causing a lot of discomfort. Hopefully it will improve over time but am happy that I have only had to get up during the night only once."
3,giving it time,"I was diagnosed that I had an elarged prostate and after doing some research saw this product. I think it is still too early to see if this will work for me, as I was told to give it at least 2 months. So, I will continue using it and evaluate its effectiveness at a later date"
4,I like it!,"I bought this item about a year ago and I still use it. I can cook an entire meal for three - four people in it and I have no complaints! The only down side is that it is a little too big for my dishwasher but it is easy to hand was, so not a big deal!!"
3,So so tape,Ultra high reflectivity but had trouble getting it to stick to my bike. I did stick it to my motorcycle helmet and it has stuck to that quite well but won't stick to my bicycle helmet. I use the motorcycle helmet more at night anyway though.
3,Stryper - Against the Law,"""Against the Law"" (1990) is the sixth album from Christian glam metal band Stryper, and their last until they reunited in 2005. Here, Stryper is trying to move away from their 1980s glam metal image: the spandex is gone, the music is harder and edgier, and the Christian elements are much less overt.It doesn't quite work. The album is decent enough, but the songs don't have quite the same pizazz as those from previous releases. There's nothing horrible here, but not much here is particularly memorable. Highlights include ""Two Time Woman"" and a cover of Earth, Wind and Fire's ""Shining Star"".On the whole, this is a decent, unspectacular album from a band that was very clearly on its way out."
3,Musically Great; Lyrically ???,"This was a relatively odd change in direction for the pioneers of Christian Heavy Metal. The music definitely took a giant step forward. The new look and lack of yellow and black was also an improvement. However, the change in lyrical content alienated most of their fan base when they were at the peak of their career. The band never recovered. My personal favorites off of this one are ""Against The Law,"" ""Rock the Hell out of You"" and ""All for One"" Michael Sweet got back to Stryper's roots on his solo projects, but the rest of the band disappeared completely. Hey Guys, do a reunion tour!!!!"
2,Would not recommend,This is a no frills set. The pieces do store underneath but the compartments come open and the pieces fall out if you turn it on the side. The letters and numbers on the grid are hard to read. There is no where to put the white and red pins while playing either. So you'll need a bag or cup to keep them in during play.
1,Very one-sided arguement,"I think that there are better resources for the use and choice not to use psychiatric drugs. I would suggest people interested in this subject read as much as they can about the drug programs their doctor recommends. I would also suggest not letting your family doc prescribe it, but rather a psychiatrist. A good psychiatrist would totally explain, as mine did, all the benefits and ill effects the medication would have. I just really think this book is too negative. I, personally was treated for anxiety disorder with anti-depressants and it gave me my life back. If I had read this book first, I wouldn't have trusted taking them. The bottom line is BE INFORMED. This book is all scare tactic. I don't think I would recommend it to anyone. It didn't tell me anything my psychiatrist hadn't told me already."
5,Excellent information,"I have used this book in assisting physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners with contract negotiation since the first edition. It is an excellent resource for contract and salary negotiation. The step-by-step, systematic and supportive approach is helpful for any healthcare professional and really could be used by anyone in any career as a guideline to negotiation. The planner, included in the book, is a very helpful tool. I have recommended this book to many nurse practitioners and physician assistants throughout the years and all have reported that they found it to be invaluable."
5,heavy and political,"I first got this album on cassette when it came out. I own the cd now. Everything is good and top notch thrash. Clean production and great musicianship especially Greg Hall,Sacred Reich's original drummer. Covered War Pigs BEFORE Faith No More and blows them into serious oblivion. Check this album and the others with Greg: Ignorance, The American Way!!! God bless,Speed Bump!"
2,A played-out remake offering nothing new,Length:: 6:08 MinsI didn't get much out of this latest American remake. WARNING--Video contains MINOR SPOILERS...
1,An Exercise In Tedium,"The title for this should've been ""And Soon The Beigeness.""The original ""And Soon The Darkness"" was an effective little ninety minute exercise in paranoia which benefited from a script from the godfathers of British TV fantasy, Brian Clemens and Terry Nation, decent performances and some spookily evocative direction.The remake fails on all levels.The director has not a wit of an idea of how to create tension; the two female leads are adepts of the histrionic Hollywood school of acting; Karl Urban (who is generally a decent actor) is given nothing to do, and the twists and turns are completely predictable.Worst of all, it's yet another excuse for the Yanks to engage in their racist paranoia about South Americans.It's not interesting enough to be good and not bad enough to be enjoyable.Avoid this one like the plague. I paid $1.50 to see it and ended up fast-forwarding through the last half hour. It made ninety minutes feel like a lifetime."
2,Disappointing DVD,"Without commenting on the content of the film itself, I'd only like to say that in my opinion the video quality was about the worst I've seen on DVD. As I watched white flecks popping like VHS dropouts, I was totally distracted from enjoying a film I've watched numerous times. I guess I've have been spoiled from viewing so many pristine images on most DVD releases."
3,So close to great.,"But no cigar.I could probably forgive the fact this is 3 hours long, but I have a difficult time understanding how you cast Ryan O'Neal as ....wait hahahahahaha...hang on a sec...hahahaha..a 30's Something General. I can beat that though-Gene Hackman as Polish officer with an accent as bad as Ellie May Clampett. Add Eliott Gould to the cast of allegedly serious action characters and you have just flunked Filmaking 101. Oh yeah, Robert Duvall plays a one-eyed German officer. ""Vee have vays of making you tawk!"" A monstrous casting disaster, and that's too bad because the rest of the cast and the action sequences are outstanding. Without these silly distractions this film is excellent. I just cant deal with the thought of ""Oliver"" commanding US troops.The Widescreen presentation and 2 Channel Dolby are more than adequate. Crank the stereo for this one...to hell with the neighbors."
2,Washed Out,"I just popped the dvd into my player and couldn't get past the first twenty minutes either. The print they used is really washed out. And Ryan O Neal is SUCH a bad actor, ugh. I used to love this movie... I'm hoping I can figure out how I managed. It aint no LONGEST DAY."
2,Ummm... What happened to the rest of the songs????,"Ok ordered this to get the full songs from the book! BUT GUESS WHAT?It is only one chorus of each song! :(Very upsetting! I know this is a kids toy but still, I just started with learning the songs so I would like the whole songs! :)Oh well!"
3,This addition is for MS Office 2003,"The methodology of this book requires a particular set up of MS Office. The book's examples are for MS Office 2003. While it says that you can adapt these instructions to other versions that may not be easily achieved in the newer versions of Office 2007, and 2010.The next book with this title is written for MS Office 2007. I don't think there is a version for MS Office 2010."
3,Not bad for a cheap violin,"Sounds good for a cheaply made violin. More bright though I would prefer a darker sound. I like how there is a volume knob on top of the violin. There's a Yamaha electric violin where the knob is on the bottom and is unreachable if you're in playing position. The mechanics work very well. It doesn't feed back. Not bad for the price. The case it comes with broke right away. It's absolutely a piece of junk as is the bow. I immediately changed the strings to Dominant strings which made it sound better.If you need an electric violin and don't have the money to get a good one, this violin gets the job done. Not the best, but what do you expect for the price?"
1,this is not an umbrella! but a regular subway map?!!!,"I thought I was ordering an umbrella as pictured, but I was contacted by the company to tell me it's just a subway map that I can get for free at any subway station. Very misleading."
1,A bold new approach? Huh?,"I only write reviews on Amazon when the books are really good or really bad. This book is definitely in the latter category. I read the book once and assumed I missed something so I read it again. Nope, still couldn't figure out what the bold new solution was that the cover claims. The writing style is extremely boring and the author uses about 3 or 4 questions in every paragraph. How did this guy get published when he is asking the reader for answers? Don't waste your money or your time."
2,disappointing,"i bought this book in very high hopes of learning everything about lightwave. but i'm very disappointed. this book is very unclearly written and confusingly stuctured, both language-wise and content-wise. even though the tutorials were all very simple, the way it was articulated made them difficult to follow and succeed on the first try. i wish there was a better lightwave book."
2,Good intro Good ending poor middlepart,"I found this book almost the worst of the inside series. The tutorial are badly explained, they require a high knowledge of the software or at least such a confidence with the software that the person that has it wouldn't buy the book. I suggest to read carefully the manual that comes with lightwave then read the book. Beside this The book give good Ideas for video post effects and character modelling and animation. What is not well developed is the explanation of the modelling techniques and without modelling you won't have anything to map or animate or to adding effect to, things that are in most part well explained.What I am trying to say Mr Ablan is to focus a little bit more on lightwave's gui and modelling aspects, since they are the base of anything else."
2,Frustrating,"The book fails to fully explain some minor steps that a beginner might wish to understand in more detail. Information such as ""feel free to look at this image closer by pulling it off this Book's CD-ROM"" does not help if you don't know the name of the image, nor in which folder it may be. Also some of the captions don't correspond with the images (e.g. page 68). If you have a lot of time on your hands you may well be able to guess the missing links, but you will probably find yourself doing the lessons over in the belief that you missed an important step, only to discover that it is missing from the book."
3,Why not widescreen??????,"When this film (great one, by the way) was shown in Sweden last year, it was shown in the widescreen 16x9 format. Why the **** is this presented in 4x3 in the US??? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?And, again, why?Why this constant disrespectful treatment of 1) the makers of these films, who create in widescreen, creating beautiful and dramatic shots, and 2) the viewers? Thank God I recorded and then burned Chill Out on DVD!!This is an affront!Oh, by the way, did I mention that I hate the 4x3 format, when not original?Thought so.5 stars for the film, two down for the 4x3 presentation"
2,Aka young master in love.,"Nothing happens until the very end, so just fast forward through till then."
2,Dull sportsmovie with one awesome fight.,"OK film. The first hour is totally senseless, Jackie and his friends just fool around with some girls and there's not much action. They don't fight much, but they do play some starnge games so this film is more about sports than fights. Someone may like that, but I HATE sports. So I think it's rather boring. Still, the final buttkicking is real great. Whan Ing Sik (or whatever his name is) lauches about 64 punches & kicks to Jackie. This is worth watching, but rewind straight to the final match."
3,Not one of Jackie's better Movies,Good action fighting as usual in Chan movies. But overall not very exciting. Chan and his friend are a little old to be playing the mischievous roles played in this movie.
1,DS9,"I am struggling to see anything in this show that has a tidbit of Star Trek in it. This particular episode was ridiculous. Where is the connection? I think the writers must have been smoking some good stuff. The concept is absurd, no government would expend the resources required to build a space station that is essentially a hotel and bar. Nor would they build one that could not defend itself. Certainly there would be Starships patrolling nearby."
3,Deep Space Nine -Second Season - A Little Disappointing,"Well, as a seasoned sci-fi fan, I loved the Deep Space Nine series the best. It seemed to be a lot deeper than the other Star Trek spin-offs. But I must say the 2nd season was flat. The writing is poor and thus, the acting is not as well as it could be. I remember that the seasons did get progressively worst. I have trepidations about ordering the 3rd season - but hey, I'm a devoted fan! Happy viewing! :-)P.S. The first season was great!"
3,Deep Space 9,"Deep Space 9 has never been my favorite. I have recently began watching the entire series again just to get to the conflicts within the series, but overall I think it is a little slow and somewhat weak on story line, compared to TNG."
2,DEFECTIVE DVD'S,AT VARIOUS TIMES THE DVD'S IN THIS SECOND SEASON WOULD SKIP AND SOMETIMES STOP ALTOGETHER. I MISSED THE LAST SEVERAL MINUTES OF DISC 6 OR 7 WHEN IT JUMPED TO THE END OF THE PROGRAM
4,The Dominion,"suprised AbsolutelyNutts didn't mention it, but i think that this episode is the first mention of the Dominion.While the episode itself is kindof lacking i think it deserves a watch for that.The background information of the Ferengi is interesting as well, but i am a bit of a nerd :p"
4,DS9 Gets Better In Sophmore Year,"Star Trek DS9: The Second Season. We're introduced to the Dominion when Quark tries to establish a Ferangi trading aggrement in the Gamma Quadrant and then the Jem'Hadar in the season ending cliffhanger. The episodes were better this year when the series seperated itself and tried to be less like The Next Generation and established its own identity. Although future seasons were better than this, a few of my favorite series episodes: notably Rivals (with The Princess Bride's Chris Sarandon) are in this season."
2,"The Alternate Universe, should have stayed with TOS","The episode ""Mirror, Mirror"" from the original Star Trek series was great, because for the first time ever it explored the possibility of alternate realities. But by 1994, that was very expanded upon. Even the Next Generation expanded upon it with multiverses. So why then, did DS9 put a whole storyline around this Mirror reality? I didn't really like the whole thing, and I don't think Gene Roddenberry would have either. I'm going to have to sit through 4 more of these (hitting the 2x). 2.6/5 stars because the cast seems to be having a good time playing different roles. But I don't think this episode is relevant to anything. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
5,Barcelona,I have always admired their individual talents.. so why didn't I buy this a long time ago? Excellent recording!
3,Love Freddie M but this was a bit of a re-hash,"I love FM and Queen sound, but expected a bit more variation on this cd. I still remain a huge FM fan and respect his unique sound, range and talent."
3,Writing is not to die for...,"The quality of the writing is average, though the story/case is interesting. That is perhaps my biggest gripe. The word choice, the description, etc., are not as strong and captivating as that of other authors (Edna Buchanan, Ann Rule, M. William Phelps, etc.) The book is still worth reading though, and sheds inside into the police handling and media coverage of a female serial killer vs. a male one..."
5,"Do not sleep on this album, it is required listening...","For all those who profess their love for hip-hop, Organized Konfusion is your dream date. The group has a lyrical flow and prowess far beyond most of their peers and elevate, rather then debase, hip-hop music. Their ryhmes, while ferocious, are mature and intelligent. They are the anti-players, Puff Daddy's nightmare. It seems as if O.K. and those like them are a rare breed in hip-hop today, and for that reason you must not sleep on this album. Support O.K. and buy ""Stress"" because there are few acts as good as them today."
5,A Classic,"This album is a rare gem even down to the cover art. It reeks of creativity. I think that this is definitely the group at it's best. Pharaoh Monche's lyrical delivery on this album (13, Bring it On, Stray Bullet) is groundbreaking in the way that Rakim has been throughout most of his career. Their most recent LP ""Equinox"" was a big disappointment. That makes this one stand out even more. BUY IT!!!!"
2,"Decent, but not essential","This short E.P. of mostly live performances was mainly an effort to hold fans over in-between albums. Some live performances with Queen were included, including a powerful hit rendition of the Freddie Mercury classic ""Somebody To Love"" (#30 US) and a lovely cover of Queen's ""These are the Days of Our Lives,"" performed as a duet with Lisa Stansfield. Michael also performs live renditions of Seal's ""Killer""(#69 US), which segues into the Rolling Stones' ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone,"" and a stark, stirring performance of Bob Telson's Oscar nominated ""Calling You"" (from the BAGDAD CAFE). Also included, for somewhat inexplicable reasons, is a brief snippet of Queen performing ""Dear Friends"" from it's SHEER HEART ATTACK album. There are enough interesting moments to make this a fine listen for Michael's fans, however, none of the covers top the originals and most listeners will be able to live without it."
2,Cumbersome to use!,"We bought this scale because of the the stated accuracy, low profile and sleek looks. Unfortunately, when we placed our baby on the scale for weighing, the mere pressure of pressing the button to ""lock"" a reading would change the weight reading - we read and re-read the manual, contacted tech support and ultimately figured that this drawback was quite real. Returned the product.We ended up buying aTanita BD-585 (BD585) Digital Pediatric Baby Scale. Its accuracy is lower than that of the SECA product, but doesn't have the drawback of changing readings when pressing buttons."
1,Not by David Ragsdale,"The Bridge is not an album by David Ragsdale. Best I can figure is someone made a copy of David and Goliath, illegally I might add, and is selling it as a new album by David Ragsdale. It ain't. Take my word for it.David Ragsdale"
1,the audio sucks!!,"the vidio is absolutely interesting. But even with the volume on the tv set turned ALL the way up..... you can barely hear it. so, it renders the DVD not worth watching."
5,Sterling Silver CZ Flower Filigree Bracelet,"You will not be disappointed. This bracelet is absolutely gorgeous, when the light hits it, it just sparkles. Very pretty detail and high quality made. Approximately 6-7mm in width. I'm going to get so much pleasure from wearing this bracelet. I am very happy with this purchase and seller shipped item out fast. This bracelet is worth every penny I spent on it and more :)"
1,not at $15 a box,I missed this product after leaving the East. The shipping is no between 10-15 $ abox I will live with out it Barrilla works fine
5,An excellent field guide to N. American tiger beetles,"As an entomologist, I have seen and used many a field guide. This guide is one of the best. Color plates are not cluttered, and each has a scale bar. Distribution maps are crisp and easy to understand. Keys are excellent, with plenty of illustrations. Checklist is included, and the sections on ecology/behavior and conservation are well done. This is a must-buy for any Cicindelid enthusiast!"
5,"Great look into the ""bottle""!",Very entertaining look into one of my favorite sitcoms. My kids now are in love with it and I wanted to know a bit more about the story behind the story. Entertaining and informative. Highly recommend to anyone moderately to very in love with the series (and Barbara Eden)!
3,"Provocative, but a mess","The book has its moments, but the conclusions are never compelling. His core mistake is that he never defines democratization. First, he conflates democratization and liberalization, which are two very different processes. As part of this, we never know when democratization begins or ends. Apparently German was democratizing for 45 years and Serbia for a century. Third, ethnic conflict has more to do with how authoritarian regimes governed than the fact that they disappeared, which would be clearer if he examined why so many ethnically diverse democratizing states have no significant rise in ethnic violence. Finally, many his policy presciptions go in the opposite direction of what a broad reading of the evidence would indicate."
3,"Terrible Quality, Great Show!","It's great to finally get this show on DVD, but the video looks like they digitized old SLP VHS recordings. It's painful to watch but it's still a great show that was ahead of its time. So just a warning to you Max Headroom fans -- don't get your hopes up."
4,Ahead of Its Time,"""Max Headroom"" was originally a character used by Channel 4 in Britain, in 1984. Matt Frewer portayed Headroom, as he did in the ABC television programme in America.Predicting a 500-channel smorgasboard of channels, reality television and webcams, MH was clearly ahead of its time. Let's hope we get a DVD soon, complete with clips from the original broadcasts, and even the entire made-for-tv movie by Channel 4.Incidentally, going by Steve Roberts's novelisation, MH takes place in the year 2004."
5,DVD purchase,"The product was well packaged and arrived when promised. It's in perfect shape, plays as it should.I'm completely satisfied with this purchase,"
3,Radar to the rescue.....NOT!,"If only there were more professional acting actors out there who could carry off GOOD CHRISTIAN roles. Radar did just fine...he's obviously a pro.... But the rest well.... I won't say they were all bad actors....but I will say they weren't comfortable infront of the camera. Some acting lessons would sure help them!The plot of the flick was fine. The scripting was fine. Camera work was fine. Radar, as mentioned was fine...but those other actors.... did I say they needed lessons?Cute movie.... for a dollar or two....."
1,Not useful at all!,"The concept is good, however it is just not functional. The game system itself barely fits inside. There are 2 small pockets for storeage of game books and the cartridges...which if you have more than two barely fit. It does not organize well and I am afraid that the cartridges will fall out at some point. This product is not worth the $20 we paid for it."
1,Do not buy these steamers,These steamers almost fell apart completely the first week we had them. The steamers come out very easily and I don't think they will last more than a month. Don't waste your money.
1,The Worst!,"I would not recommend this to anyone. It cost almost as much in shipping as the purchase price, did not heat up at all, and I was responded to by the seller with automatic generated emails that had absolutely nothing to do with my questions or complaints.........the return of the item expense was mine to bear as well..........unhappy with this purchase of ""junk"" is an understatement."
4,HISTORY OF THE DAVE CLARK FIVE,"I AM VERY SATISFIED. THE CD CAME FULLY WRAPPED SO I AM TAKING THEM AT THERE WORD THAT IT IS BRAND NEW, I WON'T KNOW UNTIL HE OPENS IT ON CHRISTMAS AND IT CAME ON TIME. GOOD JOB."
3,Where is the stereo?,"Dave Clark records were issued in the states in mono and ""re-channeled"" stereo,(junk!)However, most of the major hits exist in stereo, and sound better that way. I have this CD and never use it, with all but the last few songs being in mono.I have found stereo mp3s on the internet of most of the songs I want (never found Everybody Knows (I Still Love You), or Anyway You Want It) in stereo. Why DC doesn't do a proper retrospective is also beyond me. Since Mike Smith penned many of the tunes and is now a quadriplegic, and people are doing fundraisers for him, I'm sure he could use the royalties. It's clear DC doesn't need the dough.Share the wealth, Dave!I don't feel the least bit guilty having downloaded the MP3s as I have owned several original vinyl copies, as well as this CD compilation. I don't think Dave needs any more of my money."
4,A tighter collection would have been better!,"I do agree that the selection is complete, perhaps exhaustive. The music, I still love, is excellent as most other commentators concur, but I think a tighter 25 song single CD would have been even a better tribute, which is more the trend for European markets. The only other problem I have here is that Dave Clark unfortunately chose a significant number of mono masters rather than the TRUE STEREO mixes that exists (I have a British EMI 14 Greatest Hits album to prove it). The usual American audiophile appreciates this much more (remember the dissapointing sales of the first four Beatles CD's ?)I wrote c/o of Dave Clark at Hollywood Records after the release of this anthology, and had no response to it. I am not rejecting the project, but rather warning you of the shortcomings. Because of this, I have preserved my turntable to listen, more often than not, to the great versions in Stereo."
3,Fun for a little while,This barely lasted 2 weeks in a house of 20-somethings. Expect it to last much shorter in a kids hands.
3,cheaper than I thought,"The item that came was not the same as the picture, we ended up with some clone wars on the package not Qui Gon Jinn. This came from a costume shop. And it is not a durible toy, but a cheap ""costume"" light saber. Thin, cheap plastic. Can bend fairly easy. I would make sure I purchase the ""more expensive"" toy brand light saber for my boys to play with. This one broke the first day, we were able to fix it and can still hear something jiggling around inside.Oh well, for the cheap price it'll have to do."
5,What an uplifting read.,"Sorry but this book is no longer at the San Diego Aerospace museum. I bought it from their old book rack, and what a bargain it was. It is an excellent and detailed analysis of the history of the US Navy's rigid airship program. From the nascent post-WWI programs that focused on failed British designs (and the fatalities of several US service members) to the German Zeppelin designs of the USS Los Angeles, the program that saved the Zeppelin company and was essentially a prototype for the Graf Zeppelin that followed. The authors present layer after layer of detail in this clearly well-researched essay.If you are a 'helium head', this book is for you."
3,The more I think about it...,"...the more I like it. At first view this film doesn't seem to be anything very special or coherent, but taken at face value - a unique sort of character study - the viewer begins to appreciate its craft. None of these stories was particularly profound, and I didn't care too much for the first segment, although I do think it was well executed. But when you start getting into Posey's and Balk's acting style, you really get into the film and start rooting for these characters, whatever their goals may be. The digital film medium enhances this film a lot, with wonderful close-ups and POV shots. I barely even noticed the movement of the hand-held camera, which is the mark of true precision. This film allowed its lead actresses to explore the depths of their talent, and they reached as far as they could to achieve it. This film is a wonderful chance to see three popular actresses in some very different and heartfelt roles, and I'm glad I got the chance to see that."
2,Lame!!!!,"It's a lame attempt to show off 3d technology in a poorly produced and poorly made movie. If this movie was in 2d, it wouldn't even make it onto PBS at 2 a.m. on a Saturday. The commentator is lame and his analysis of the ""Universe"" is something a 1st grader would get bored with.p.s. Pluto's not a planet anymore."
4,Great experience,"This is a great production, a little of cross talk in certain points which is annoying, but in general very good 3D."
1,Not what I expected,"I was expecting to get a bright and beautiful view of our universe. Instead it was a lesson in evolution.If I had known this, I would not have ordered it. It stays in the cabinet now."
2,Basic,"The movie was very basic, good for kids. The 3D effects were also just ok, didnt really feel like you were there."
2,View master,"Bad 3d quality, remind me off the old view master, Didn't even finish tha all movie, not worth it at all."
3,Very Informative But a Little Rushed,"Overall this movie is good however its only about 45 minutes long so not a lot of time is spent of each topic. The 3D effects were just average and there was room for them to be a little better. If your as interested in astronomy is I am you'll enjoy it just for the content, but you won't be blown away by the 3D effects."
2,Very Disappointing,"I bought this, hoping to update my knowledge and to open the eyes of my young grandsons to some of the wonders of our universe. What I dislike so much about this film is its failure to differentiate between what is pretty solidly backed by evidence and what is far more speculative. This struck me as more entertainment than science, and I was not entertained. I had to force myself to watch it through to the end. Last night I watched the first of four episodes of the new PBS/Nova series, Fabric of the Cosmos, which will be released on DVD and Blu-Ray November 22, 2011. It is far, far superior to The Universe: 7 Wonders of the Solar System."
1,Junk,"Don't let that slick ""cover art"" fool you. This really is quite horrible. Really, do not buy this. It really is poor in every way. It's not even remotely entertaining, engaging, or even that educational!Forget the fact that it has no 3D ""WOW"" whatsoever.If I could give it negative stars, I would. It really is junk."
4,"Space, 3D, Blue-Ray",Purchased along with Flight DVD. Nothing more to add to excellence! Any one of any age will benefit from this video. Good investment for entire family
2,its just ok,no big 3d effects. it is just average video. i expected good 3d effects but disappointed. .... .. .. .
1,Old footage,Looked like old animation converted to 3D mixed with new interviews shot in 3D. Very poor quality space animation with an added cartoon like hud display (would have been better without it)overlayed on the screen. Very disappointed!
3,A bit disappointed,"Being somewhat new to the 3D experience, I was expecting to be blown away but I wasn't. At all. The movie is on the level of an elementary school science class. If you will be showing it to young people, great. If you're looking for something way beyond that save your money. I gave it 3 stars because it obviously wasn't what I wanted but I can't critcize the content for its intended audience."
2,"Fits over can, but no seal.","This lid fits loosely over my cat's canned cat food can. There is no seal, and if you're like me and pick up the can by the lid sometimes, it'll slide right off. My cat eats EVO 5.5 oz canned cat food with a standard 3-3/8"" diameter opening. Hope this helps!"
1,Misleading Picture...only ONE cap included,"I love these cat can caps, but be very careful: I ordered what I thought was one order that would include TWO caps, because that's what the picture showed. Unfortunately, only ONE cap came to my house. I tried to deal with the dealer who insisted that I had been wrong. Thus ensued a really horrible mass of nasty emails from him. Amazon finally returned my money, which would have been fine, except that the same picture is there still and I feel that other people may be mislead.So, be careful. Amazon's great to order from, it's their outside businesses that are often a problem."
2,Fun but don't count on instructions,"I'm working overseas so I'm kind of stuck with the fitness DVD's I came out with. That explains why I'm still working out with this DVD--it's taken me about 2 months of one and off use before I can 'mostly' do all the steps. Yes. I have other videos that have a seperate section where steps are explained. Not this one! Just try to pick it up she says! And this is fast-paced, complex choreography too. The music is good, so once you learn it, it's fun. It just takes a while to learn it. Be warned."
5,Hurry up please,"Holy Dvds.I know all about the studios squabbling over this one, i cannot believe they do'nt realise, there are people out here who want to own it now.Not in another 40 years time, but at this present moment.Cmon get it together and give the public what they want!!!!"
2,Batman Dvd,"It was ok but I found a great one on E _ay this set is really well done the Artwork Speaks for itself it has a Purple theme , and it has the Joker on the Cover this is where to find it [...] Incredible set and I just Purchased the green hornet from them as well these people really know what there doing Excellent Beautiful Artwork !"
5,BATMAN 1966 TV SERIES ON DVD,I AM A BIG FAN OF THE SHOW BUT I WONDER IF OR WHEN IT WILL COME ON DVD.IT WOULD BE NICE IF IT CAME ON BLU RAY .BUT I GUESS ITS UP TO FOX VIDEO.?
3,Description,"""Women aren't welcome at Danes' Dyke,"" the inscrutable Thor Halden told Raine; nevertheless circumstances forced him to take her under his roof and to persuade her to masquerade as his wife for a time.Even before she found herself falling in love with him, it was a difficult situation for Raine. Would she ever be able to make him trust her?"
3,Decent CD...Not Great,"I had this lp almost thirty years ago and had no recollection of the music. To put it bluntly, this is very average. The Currie sister's version of Rainbow's ""Since You've Been Gone"" is as good if not better than the original, but the other remake of ""Cherry bomb"" by the Runaways is mediocre at best. I think I bought this lp originally because they were so hot back then, and didn't pay much attention to the music. This is a cd for the collectors and not for your average music lover."
5,The Old Crooner does Good!,"Bing Crosby does a wonderful acting job in this movie. This is not the ""Fluff and Fun"" of the Road movies, but serious acting, highlighting a level of talent I've never seen before. The movie is a bit ""Black"", along the lines of ""The Days of Wine and Roses"". Do not miss this great movie!"
4,Who knew Bing could act?,"Good movie; great performances! Grace Kelly won the Oscar and she was up against Judy Garland (""A Star Is Born"") AND Audrey Hepburn (""Sabrina"") - amazing. Bing didn't win, but he was up against Marlon Brando (who won), Humphrey Bogard AND James Mason - quite a line up! Anyway, I was shocked at the excellence of Bing's acting - a tribute to the director."
4,"Nice, but I'd still go for Khalil","This book by Vidyasagar is a classic. However, I feel that Khalil is a more reader-friendly book, if you are taking a course. The best thing I liked about the book is that results are not merely stated, but the author has tried to provide an intuition or a physical interpretation of the result.The flip side is that examples and exercise problems are too few in number, but I think that this will be a very good book to learn from if the course is taught by a very good instructor."
3,How Dell does it - Or rather how the Author does it.....,"I am still reading this book. I have gone through around 100 pages or so.A lot of things are widely known. But worst of all, I don't know if I can believe this book at all.The author included a lot of quotes from articles and Dell's website.Has the author interviewed any insiders who might have offered insights into how Dell is managed ? Or did he just bash together this book from all the anecdotes available after ""googling Dell"" on the web."
3,STANDARD STUFF,For fans of the genre. Nothing really sticks out as *great*. Pretty consistent standard stuff.
1,Laughable.,"A sad, melodramatic attempt to cash in on the gangsta-exploitation craze of the early 90s. Typical plot, typical ending, typical everything. The movie is so sad that it's funny -- especially the dimwittedness of the slapstick ""Duece Gang."" Watch this movie when it comes on the USA network in the wee hours of the morning, if you want a cure for your insomnia."
1,"waste of time, money, and talent","South Central is a gloriously stupid celluloid bundle of stereotypes. You will laugh out loud at the unintentionally hilarious dialogue, and you'll cry when you realize that you paid to rent this film. The director, Steve ""Give me 'hood props"" Anderson, went on to direct ""Spice World."" Enough said."
3,Comfortable But Wearing Out Quickly,"I've owned these shoes for about six months at the time of this review. They're quite comfortable for daily use but they're already showing advanced signs of wear. The soles are made of very soft rubber and are nearly worn through at the balls of my feet. There's also a rather large spot of wear inside on the left heel, and the stitching is starting to fray and break. I suppose I shouldn't expect a lot from an inexpensive pair of shoes but the early signs of wear are still disappointing. I expect another few months of use from these shoes before I either have them resoled (a possibility because of their comfort) or throw them away. A nice looking, comfortable shoe that isn't as rugged as it looks."
1,Awful,"This movie is absolutely horrible. It did not make me laugh, it did not make me care at all for the main character, and it did not entertain me. The only reasons to even watch this movie are that ""End of the Line"" by the Traveling Wilburys is played over the opening and closing credits, and George Harrison and David Byrne make cameos."
1,Bad experience,I do not receive the titanium bit that normally I bought in the other size. This item dose not has a brad point
5,Hopeful dissertation on confronting ones fears,I am currently separated and have been for 2 years. I am hopeful to get my wife to read this book as it has made a great change in my life. It has very good exercises to practice with the one you love. I pray that I get the opportunity. We all have fears about our marriage relationship and what will cause its demise. Sometimes it is caused by our inability to convey how we feel about issues in a non attacking or controlling way. It has helped me to admit to myself that sometimes I try to control my situation by controlling my wife's reactions sometimes on purpose other times just by the anger or frustration in certain situations. This book is a good resource to confront our own problems first and then hopefully get together with the woman we love and put our fears to rest and have a meeting of the minds through true openess of our frustrations and fears in a constructive way.Thanks to the authors.
2,Thought it would be better.,"I have always been a guy who has liked Clinton, faults and all. The previous reviewer hit the nail on the head. I am always skeptical of opinions that may be clouded by personal judgement, but without repeating what the previous reviewer stated he is quite accurate in his portrayal of this autobiography."
5,scary as hell,This Movie is one of the scariest movies i've seen. if your looking for horror not gore buy this now!!!!! definnatley worth every penny!!!!!
5,Great resource for amateur STM designers,"This may be a good resource for professionals also - but they'll have to speak for themselves. As an amateur, I found the instrumentation section extremely valuable. It is primarily because of that section that I give the text 5 stars. After plowing through a great many journal papers I eventually found that most of the theory and practice of building an STM had in fact been nicely distilled by Chen. There are some minor mistakes (e.g. discrepencies between the text and some figures), but nothing critical that I could see. A number of disparate but relevant prerequisite topics are addressed in the appendices with moderate success.If there is a peer or superior alternative to the instrumentation and design aspects of STMs, I would love to hear of it!"
5,The beginning of beginning,"I was first introduced to Ram Dass during high school... During a time of pain, angst, and cynicism... This tape really began me on the journey of opening my mind, heart, and trust to the world. It has been years since I had listened to the tape, and I recently listened to it again (7 years later) and it was a wonderful refresher. After some years of growing, listening to his words again opened doors, areas of thinking, that I had not quite gotten the first time around. I enjoy his honesty and ability to bring into words what I often am feeling and unable to express."
4,Original TV Series Wombling Gourmet / Wombles Workout 1983,"SYNOPSISWombles are short, fat, furry creatures who love to tidy up after messy humans. Their motto is ""make good use of bad rubbish"" and they are only seen by humans who believe in them. Titles are: ""Wombling Gourmet"" and ""Wombles Workout."" Put out by Satori on RCA/Columbia Pictures Home video. approx 60 Minutes."
2,"Got this for my mother, 76 who has a new car.","I got this for my mother, 76, who just got herself a new car. I was disapointed. The author clearly knows her stuff, the basics are well enough explained and Mom said to keep it. But: The tone is condesnding and there is nothing on washing, waxing and maintaining the finish. On what to do after an accident, she must have asked a lawyer - it's just right on how to deal with insurance co.s, not saying it was your fault - but there's nothing on getting off the road, out of the car, making sure other drivers are alerted, flares etc. and nothing on hitting a deer or someone's dog. It could be so much better...."
5,LIttle Known American History,"This is a GREAT BOOK! We own a farm along the Canal and wonder how it came to be. I found a lot more - like its influence on migration to the West and growth of the UNited States. We could use a lot more canals now to save fuel on freight, or why not restore the ones we once had?"
