2,inexpensive but quick to quit,It's a great little unit but it requires a bit of effort being that it's operated by a crank. It is good for beating around very soft things like eggs and yogurt but fails miserably when it comes to chopping heartier things like vegetables. The problem is that the gears are made of plastic. After my 3rd pico de gallo consisting of tomatoes and onions the gears had stripped. Do not expect years of use out of this product if you intend to use it to chop any fruit or vegy that has not been pre-softened by boiling.
5,you can't summarize this cd in one line,"it's beyond great, it's new it's original, it's emotional, you understand and feel the lyrics... i got this cd the same day i got ""i'm an elastic firecracker"" by tripping daisy, and i couldn't stop listening to them both for atleast 6 months, i still listen to them, it's worth the investment."
5,This Album Freakin' Rocks!,"Raw, Loud, Raunchy, Powerful, In Your Face Rock N' Roll!The faint of heart may be disturbed by the sometimes violent if not down right sadistic lyrics... but too freaken' bad, this is not an album for wimps!Why this band isn't a house hold name is beyond me. I have this album, ""Hell Below-Stars Above"" and ""Buried in Your Black Heart"" (Burden Bros.) all 3 are fantastic... I Hunger For More!Some record label needs to feed these guys some money, lock them in a studio and force them crank out more albums!"
5,The handbook of canadian securities,This is a great book for true fundamental canadian securities valuation. It is very complete and the individual authors seems to be quite qualified.
1,Nothing but copies,"You think a person just starting out in the music business would come out with an album of origionals but yet Rockell does everything but that. Although she has a powerful voice, her songs are mostly remakes of old songs with no credit given to the origional artists. For example Jossette did ""in a Dream "" first and Rockell copied the whold song note for note c'mon if you're gonna copy a song chage it at least a little bit. My suggestion....don't waste your money on copies. Buy the originals they are much MUCH better!!!"
4,Great CD,I first got this album back in 98 when her first song In A Dream came out.The album is great and she really has a beautiful voice and all the tracks are great with a freestyle beat to it.Now I know she came out with a second album I heard her song What You Did 2 Me and its fresh so i'm going to get the second album for sure.So people if you love Rockell get her new album!
4,rockell has a real good voice and is worth hearing,"rockell does copy some songs from other artist, but her style is original in itself and the remakes are good. there are about three real good songs on this track, however, the rest are mediocre."
4,"Trumpets Indeed! (Or, why aren't more people reading this?","Science fiction authors tackle many themes in their work, from politics to sociology, from history to the military. But how many write creatively of the interplay between people and their artistic culture? The only author I know to attempt this regularly is Lloyd Biggle. In Trumpets, a prequel to World Mendors, he asks the question: how would a deeply artistic people appear to those who are blind to this aspect of culture? And, given that the blind have a worthy goal in mind, how can they effect a cultural change in an artistic society without ruining it? I wouldn't say that Biggle explores this topic perfectly in Trumpets (for that, see either World Mendors or Monument), but this book is still a highly exciting, thought-provoking read. Better still, it is a book you will remember long after you close the last pages. And, in the end, what more can one ask of a volume?"
3,Wonderful idea: nicely done,"This book is one of those where, after a single reading, fifteen years ago, I can remember the main plot very clearly, because it is (basically) a single idea, beautifully strung out and delivered with zest by a real storytelling craftsman.Actually it is a single idea about ""a single idea"", which is an amusing symmetry.I wish I'd had this and more like it to read when I was younger."
4,Very thin material. would not recommend for winds over 5 mph,"Great design, nicely printed but material is very thin and cheap. But for the price would be expected. If you live in a very windy area, would spend for a better flag"
3,Prescriptive Authority for Psychologists,"The book is essentially of interest to Mental Health professionals who are interest in understanding the history, legislation, and research done in the area of allowing Psychologists the right to prescribe medication. The book is a series of articles that review, critique, and analyze the field. It gives a good background on programs that have been sucessful and programs that are going on today. Add a star if you are a practicing psychologist."
3,Civil War For Young Readers,"This book is written in style very similar to a textbook. I found it interesting, and it would be especially good for younger readers who are interested in learning more about the Civil War. One of the strengths of the book was the photos as well as many paintings and drawings that came from the period of the Civil War. These give the reader a picture of the scenes of war. Other helpful things found in the book are maps of battlefields with explanations of what took place and in what areas. The book might be a little old and outdated, but it is still very helpful in explaining more of that awful period of American history."
3,Cute little scooter,"I just got this for my daughter's 3rd birthday. We bought it at Target and it was pretty easy to put together. She likes it so far, she's been riding it around every day. The little basket is a nice addition to put a little animal or toy in, or a snack. It doesn't roll very good though compared to a Razor, but that's probably because its a beginner style. And I only give it 3 stars because of the crappy bearings, and the little wheel covers on the back stick out about 3/4"", so my daughter keeps hitting her foot on them unless she kicks out real wide. If you take them off, the screws stick out almost as far. Its kind of silly the way the back wheels are designed."
1,One more disapointment,"This is one more pathetic Kraftwerk's (post Bartos) release. Lack of creativity, lack of that unique percussive sound, this is just one more boring electronic (Dj style) group same sound of the others. R.I.P., Kraftwerk. We're sorry."
3,Grungy But Not Exciting,"Bonnet has returned to the... I mean, Helmet has returned to the stage with yet another album chock full of mean things. Unfortunately they've thrown out the hammering guitars and vocals in favor of sappy drums and washed-out riffs hidden somewhere in the background. It was a wild ride from Metal to Pop and I'm sad to see them go."
2,Plodding...,"Sludge rock with a little grunge. A mostly dull release in all regards. Plodding songs that show little varience go nowhere. I cannot get into this even after a decade. Some moments see the songs taking off 'somewhere' but it is a mere tease of what the band might be capable of if they decided to write good songs.In short, Listen only if you have plenty of TIME on your hands."
4,"Sturdy, easy to use, but could use quality controls","The hook is very easy to install. It is made of relatively heavy and sturdy metal. The hook easily swings from side to side and does not interfere with door closing. It just wiggles a little when in use. However, this item could use better quality controls because one of the bulbs that forms the hook end had a slight dimple forming a visual imperfection (especially at the price charged). This is the only reason I didn't give this product 5-stars. The rest of the finish is smooth and good. I plan to purchase another one for my second bathroom."
5,So GREAT!,"Christina Aguilera rocks end of story. This cd is her best work so far after hearing her new song ""A Song For You,"" on the various artists cd called Possibilites her voice has matured even more and is still beautiful.Christina never seizes to amaze me, and if you say shes untalented I really think you need to get your ears checked. I think shes on the same level of talent as Mariah Carey. Christina will be around for many years to come.<3 Christina Fan For Life"
2,"Great Voice,but....","I have a lot more respect for this gal then for Britiney Spears. But it seems like she has a good voice, but is still singing bubblegum pop and Mickey Mouse Club lyrics. And her image is still that of a bearly-wearing-any-clothes immodest jerk. If your gonna buy it, do it for the voice."
3,Pretty good,I am not really a fan of christina but this CD is pretty good but not great.I like The slow songs the best.
4,STRIPPED,"this is probably xtina's best album out of all three i think. it's a lot more mature and it showed the grown up part of xtina. i bought the cd on the third day it was released. my personal fave on the album is ""dirrty,"" cuz that was the song that made me bought the cd. the reason i only gave it four star is b/c...that she could've done a little bit more better, cuz some of the songs r kinda boring and they don't really mean anything. but i still recommend this album to every1 who likes pop music.ps.xtina is a great singer"
5,Simply amazing,"Ok, so I'm one of those people who are anti-""X-tina."" I mean, I just dislike her whole image and how she puts herself out there. Many would agree with me when I say she's whorish. But with that stunt she displays, she has a breathtakingly talented voice for a pop artist. I absolutely loved the CD. It's exactly the opposite of what I imagined her to make. I never like songs with cliche words but this girl's defiently done her part. My favorites are ""Infatuation,"" ""Walk Away,"" and ""Get Mine, Get Yours."" They are such amazing tunes and I just can't stop humming them. Totally get this CD, you won't be dissapointed."
4,"It is a great album, but......","I bought this album a few weeks ago, and I think it is very good. Christina was not able to show me her style in this album. I mean, there are Alicia Keys (Impossible), Mariah Carey(Love me for me)(Beautiful), Rock Chics(Fighter),Latin (Infatuation),Some R&B Diva, but where is Christina?This is why I am giving it a 4 star out of 5. Still, this is a very good album, and you should get it."
5,and i use to hate christina...,"I use to really hate Christina, i never liked her image and thought her music was horrible, but this CD has totally changed my mind. Christina has a beautiful voice that you really get to hear in this cd, especially in the song A Voice Within...she has really put alot of work in expressing herself in this new album, it has many upbeat and slow songs that make this album equally great! I was never a Christina Fan, but now i'm the biggest!! She may have the best voice of this time..."
5,Laugh in the face of all things Britney,"I'm almost ashamed to admit it now, but before i heard this cd, i thought Britney Spears's, BRITNEY was actually a good album. I thought it was real and mature. But now that i have heard Christina's album, Britney's cd makes me want to laugh til I cry, because it is so obvious that Britney is trying to grow, but she's still just a little girl. Christina Aguilera is a woman who can sing about life exspieriences because shes expierienced things. This is a wonderful cd, and if you didn't like Christina's first cd, then put it completley out of your mind and get this album, because there is so much growth here, i can't believe it has only been 3 years since her last album. Like how she dresses or not, this album shows that Christina Aguleria knows exactly what a womans about."
5,Glad I bought this! Don't be decieved by image...,"I have to applaud Christina Aguilera for giving us one of the best CD's of the year. I have always been a Christina fan and was a little off put by her change in image. BUT I bought the CD anyway and was not deceived by the first released song ""Dirrty"". The rest of the CD is a stunning look into her soul and what she's feeling right now. Her teen pop days are way over and I think that she is making the move in the right direction.Before I read any of these reviews and simply listened to the CD, I immediately thought back to when ""Janet"" was released. That album broke new ground for Janet Jackson and I feel that this album will do the same for Christina Aguilera.Congrats to Christina for being ""Stripped"" of all pretense and for being real."
4,Sorry you can't define her....,"Xtina is truly in a class of her own. I was an average Xtina fan until I heard this CD & then I became & huge fan. Xtina puts Britney, Beyonce, Ashanti & those other so called singers to shame. If she can back away form the ""I'm A Whore"" image, Xtina will definitely become a icon if she isn't one already one.The album starts off with an interlude that could've been made into one song (add on Stripped pt. 2). Every song on this album is great except for Underappreciated & Make Over which in my opinion could've been left on the cutting room floor.The standout tracks in my opinion are ""Impossible"" which X-tina teams up with the very talented Alicia Keys for a soulful banger. ""Loving Me 4 Me"" lets us see the romantic & softer side of Xtina that is beautifully done. ""The Voice Within"" shows Xtina at her best vocally. If you want to hear some true talent, then definitely pick this one up!"
5,I Never Knew!,"Yes, I did finally purchased this CD and I am not disappointed so far. I saw Christina on the Grammys and I never knew the girl could sing. She was a shining star and certainly won a fan here! Just got my copy in the mail so I'll elaborate after listening for awhile."
5,WAKE UP,"Please don't sleep on this album. I have read many reviews and most everybody has nailed it. This is by far the best album that I have heard in a while. This is one of two cds that I own where I don't skip s aingle track. The best song on the CD is Walk Away. This song, if she releases it as a single, will secure Christina a spot among legends such as Whitney, Celine, Mariah, and dare I say Aretha and Patty Labelle? If this is how good she sounds at 21, think about how she will sound in 5 years. If I want to hear a beautiful voice and excellent lyrics, I'll put in Stripped."
1,"Christina, is so over","This cd was okay, but no two star review though. Except for some okay songs, this CD will be in the Bargin Bin at Tower before we know(and it won't be there so they can order more, it will be there just to off load the remander of the CD's that they can't sell) Even though Christina is a grammy winner, does mean that she is any good any more. To put it the word's of Hilary Duff's song(NOT, I repeat NOT her own opinion about Christina,but in a song of hers) Christina is 'so yesterday'. Save your money and buy one of her other CD's or buy the CD's from the 'not real artists' that does not appeal to her own vanity. So, save your money. However, if you really want this CD go to the used CD's bin or just burn it off your friend or something, but just save your 19 some odd dollars and spend it on something else"
4,better than I thought,"I'm no christina aguilera fan or any teeny-bopper bubblegum artist fan, but when I heard the song Dirrty on the radio, Christina had won me over and I just had to get this album and I saw a different side of her behind the image. Rockwilder produced Dirrty and I wish he produced more songs on the album, but there are also other good tracks on this album with beautifully written lyrics, great vocals and catchy melodies. Impossible and Fighter and Beautiful are other really really good tracks. I'm still getting through listening to the rest of the album, but it's worth hearing!"
5,Don't judge a book.....,"Sure Christina lives up to her sexy image, but beyond that is some serious and soulful songwriting. This disc rocks."
2,"""You wanna break me down!""","Christina Aguilera's voice lately sounds terrible,there are only two good songs on this album which are Make Over and Cruz. I liked these songs on frist listen. I have never been a fan of Aguilera but i give her credit on writing this album. If you're a huge Christina fan, then this album is for you. She's too trampy for me, put your clothes back on girl!"
5,she is the best !!!,"I must say, i wasn't a fan of this girl because i don't like pop but this cd is a piece of art, this woman can sing!, and not only, she can write decent songs too.i loved the interludes, the way she sing every song; particulary i love cruz i identify a lot whit that song its so free and strong at the same time. other of my favorites is walk away it's an amizing song apasionate, sad and deep song,get mine get yours: this song is just SEXY that's the best word to discribe it. soars impecable, pure , great message and of course beautiful is honest it's just amaizing.now i'm a fan of Miss Aguilera 5 stars"
5,The REAL Voice,"Forget Mariah Carey,X-tina has the REAL voice and the right material to sell records.She doesn't scream like Mariah does,Chris truly sings from her heart.This album is Christina's latest and Christina's best to date.Her voice ain't irritating like some other artists.All the songs are great but my favorites are Can't Hold Us Down feat.Lil' Kim,Walk Away(this song shows you the powerful voice that's Christina),Fighter,Infactuation,Impossible,Beautiful,Make Over,Dirrty and the Voice Within.Christina Aguilera is the best POP singer out there."
2,hmmm...,"Let me just start off by saying that I am not anti-Christina, because I am a small fan of her which is why I purchased the CD. I was disappointed when I listened to the CD. There were a few good tracks, such as ""Infatuation"" and ""Fighter""(which is why I did not give the CD 1 star), but I was not impressed by the majority of the CD. Christina has definitely created a new sound in her music which did not catch my attention. Only buy this CD if you are a truly devoted Christina fan."
5,WOW - is all I can say,"I was surprised by this album, I thought it was going to be dirty and trashy like Christina's appearance but it's not. This is a wonderful album and Christina dilivers it well. There are 16 songs on here and not one clucker like on most albums. ""Dirrty"" is a good song but does not ever tell you of what the album is about at all, there are many different styles of music and some very beautiful arraingments. ""Soar"" is one of my favoirte tracks, it's inspirational and fun to listen to. It's surprising how much a person can change and grow in the course of 3 years but Christina did that and we are left with a work of art for someone like of her abilites. ""Stripped"" isn't just about sex, it's about growth and love and finding inner strength, it's a must have for anyone who likes good music. I think that you will be pleasently surprised."
5,CHRISTINA TAKES US TO HER PERSONAL LIFE WITH THIS CD!!!!!!,Christina Aguilera has a amazing voice and needless to say i think she is a lot better then Britney that is my opinion!!!! When i heard this cd each song is great and some of it is very energic and some of it really moves me!!!!!! I think that each song is a five star and the same for the album itself!!!!!! Christina really does take us to some of her past which i think its awesome that she can write songs about her past and Rolling Stone Magazine had a issue saying that this is a must have cd for any music collection and i would have to agree you will love this cd from a talented young singer!!!!!!
5,WOW,"I'll be honest. I used to hate Christina Aguilera for the simple fact that she was wasting her so obvious talent on the teeny-bopper ...that she was singing before. This album is a BIG difference. Although the first single, Dirrty, would lead you to believe otherwise, this album is completely different than any other pop album on the market right now. Dirrty is probably the worst (and trashiest) track on the album, but all the other tracks are nothing short of brilliant. Christina sings every song with such passion, and the fact that she helped write and produce the album is a big plus in my book. Props to Christina on this effort."
2,Hmmmmmm!,"First of all I am no Christina fan. I find her annoying. I find her voice annoying and this album is pretty much annoying. the reason why I don't like this album is because it's not just so long. but it contain to much of different music,style,vocal ranges,arrangements and beats that it becomes a big whole mess. The lyrics which often feel like they're written by someone else ( I'm sorry that I am not a virgin. sounds Like Britney not Christina). and the lyrics for the song I'm Beautiful. Please Who in earth do you think you are. This album will proabbly do well because there are so many TRL fans that love Christina but I Do not think she's going to the right direction. There are some songs on it that I think are allright but I think Christina should grow as a person before growing as an artist."
4,Not What I Expected.,"It's unfortunate that Christina Aguilera vamped up her image (a really nice way of putting it) the way she did and released ""Dirrty"" as her first single. Because of these two things, the rest of the album ""Stripped"" is overlooked. I was impressed with this album. At first, I expected the same bubblegum pop music that was on her first album. I knew that she has ""grown up"", but I still just expected the same old music with and ""older"" feel to it (i.e. Britney Spears), but that wasn't the case with ""Stripped."" Many of the songs on this album are very good and, as usual, Christina blows everyone away with her powerful voice."
3,my review,"i enjoy the music, but cd was not in condition stated there were pauses in some songs, would not have purchased had i known."
1,'Stripped'of talent,"This CD is bad. Well, not'bad', but a dissapointment I'll say. The only danceable tracks are obveiously ""Dirrty"" ""Fighter"" ""Can't Hold Us Down"" ""Make Over"" ""I'm Leavi'n"" The only problem with this CD is that it is too over produced. In some songs, you can barely hear her voice, so it appears that Christina can't sing, which draws me to a one star rating. Christina can sing,but her attitude twards fellow pop singers is monstrous. That too draws me to my one star rating. Anybody who is that child-like to hate everybody who is the slightest competition should be in grade school still. Her lack of maturity and honor for life is appaling. All of these personality trates show up in her songs,even though the CD was made before the comments were."
2,"hot body, lousy music",Christina Aguilera has a hot body and makes lousy music.What more is there to say?
5,GREAT JOB,"I really hope that people get a chance to listen to Christina's whole CD. It is nothing at all like ""Dirrty"". There's only one other song that is as sexual as that one. The rest of the songs are beautiful, soulful, and you can tell they come from her heart. She sings with such passion on this record, especially on my favorite song ""Walk Away."" The first time I heard it I started to cry b/c it was so emotional, and you could tell Christina was singing it from her heart. Some of the songs on this CD sound like something Alicia Keys would sing. It is that good, and I hope that Christina gets the recognition she deserves for her amazing voice and ability. Hopefully this CD will get nominated for a Grammy. It deserves to."
5,Unbelievable!!,"First i thought it's gonna be al some kinda Dirrty-likewise songs. But hey, i was totally shocked when i first heard this cd. It was so amazing good, I must confess at first i just saw christina as a one of million britney rip-of. But she truly has found her way, I'd say: Byebye britney heloo Christina. This cd rocks!! If she keeps on making such cd's...she's gonna be my favorite :-))"
5,"Christina, the true DIVA, still soars above Brittany","I have always laughed, upon hearing it mentioned that there is any similarity between Christina and Brittany. Finally, this album should put that issue to rest for everyone. Christina is the one who is and always has been truly vocally gifted."
5,X-tina can kick Avril's ass!,"This girl has serious talent. Her range is beyond amazing and some of the beats just make you want to listen to this CD over and over again. The lyrical content is fabulous - I don't think it could get much better than this. BTW, people need to stop dissin her fashion sense. Most people don't look as good as she does so they probably get all jealous when they see her in skimpy clothes. Avril probably wishes she looked like X-tina. Hell, Avril probably wishes she could SING like X-tina too, but we all know that's not gonna ever happen. The best songs on this album, I think, are: Can't Hold Us Down, Beautiful, I'm OK, Dirrty, The Voice Within, and Singing my Song. All of the songs are fabulous, though, and you won't want to skip over a single one of 'em. Besides, these songs have positive MESSAGES! What more could you ask for?"
3,Eh,"Besides the catchy inventive singles of ""Dirrty"", ""Fighter"", ""Beautiful"", and ""Can't Hold Us Down"", this album is stripped of anything worthwhile.Of course, four worthwhile songs on one album isn't anything to scoff at either. The problem is all the boring, droning filler songs that occupy the space inbetween.While I appreciate the confessionals (""Sorry I'm not a virgin, sorry I'm not a slut"") it really detracts from what the rest of the album has to say. Which is, overall, surviving.I dunno, take from it what you will. Just...make sure you get this cheap.Added 6/29/05 - I just rediscovered the song ""Make Over"". Wow! Where did *this* come from?! I am entirely impressed, and sort of wish I could add a half-star to my rating. *sigh*"
3,Somewhat dull,"I thought this would be more of a behind the scenes/documentary type film. Unfortunately, it was not veryinteresting to me...although I enjoyed watching Cole Tucker talk about his life in the adult business. Could have been a little more in depth."
2,Very dated,Thought I wanted this cd again but when I got it I listened top it a few times and now it collects dust.
2,the school and society,I am a education major at Macon State college. John Dewey's book is simply a summary of three talks Dewey gave to parnets and students at the University of Chicago Laboratory school in 1896. The book covers topics that are often very diverse and shares conflicting political and philosophic positions in education. I found this book hard to read and very wordy. I did not enjoy the read at all.
3,Sleek Tall Fan,I was looking for a few things in a fan.- Not too expensive- Not too tall- Something that will be quiet and not very noisyThis fan met all the criteria expect the height though we decided not to use one of the pieces between the base and the fan to make it look shorter and it works for us. Fits in perfectly in our living room since everything else is black as well. Not very noisy. Works great so far. I have two of them.
1,Not as advertised whatsoever...,"I purchased this fan based on the claims that it was 1) quiet/silent and 2) had a cooling feature. It's not quiet by any means, but it doesn't exactly roar either. The cooling feature is absolutely useless. I'll set it to the lowest setting and feel no change at all. A waste of $65."
3,Fanning Mechanism Is Okay But Too Cheap for My Tastes,"I'm sorry I bought the Honeywell. Here's why: The instruction manual is pathetic so that I still don't know where the tightening screw goes to stabilize the tower and the base. I'm using the fan without the stabilizing screw and am not using the height extender for 2 reasons: it's cheap plastic and the manual warns that you will lose stability if you extend the height. Why make an extension if you have to warn the owner that such measures will decrease stability? This seems lame. Also I have not opened the remote battery compartment yet because repeated efforts have failed and the cheap remote plastic appears to ""want"" to break. Truth be told, I should have went with my instincts and bought the 99 dollar Vornado 783B. Lesson: You get what you pay for."
5,All Stars!,"This fan is everything I had hoped it would be. Assembly took about 10 minutes and we use this in our large (apx. 25 x 25) living room. It was 82 when we turned the fan on, and within a few minutes, the temperature was down to 76.The fan is pretty quiet, even on its highest setting. There are multiple fan options (low, medium, high, and a combination of low/medium, and low/high) - what more could you ask for?The temperature setting and automatic timer are great features. The remote control works well from a distance as well. Some oscillating fans make a clicking noise as they oscillate, but not this one!I would definitely recommend this fan!"
1,Junk-don't buy it.,"This fan worked great for about 2 months. Now it won't oscillate. $70 out the window. Buy a cheap $10 box fan, you'd be much better off."
5,A cool fan.,"I did not hesitate in buying this fan when I found it because of its styling. And I am not disappointed now that I got it. I was a little worried about its height as I read in another review but thats unnoticeable as I feel the cool breeze on my face while seated in the sofa. The degree of rotation is good, covers a wide area and you will forget thats its with the TV playing, very quiet.If you are looking for a fan that won't topple over easily, has a small footprint, cools your room, has a nice style... then this Honeywell Tower is perfect. And look at the price."
5,Very Pleased,I am very happy with my new fan. It has good power and is quiet. I would highly recommened it.
1,OMG,"Bought this fan, couldn't wait til it got here. Well it's been here less then 3 hours up and running, oops until an hour ago!!!! It just started smelling like burnt wire and then shut off. I did read the reviews as always but with a grain of salt. Going to try one more unit, due to amazon's return policy,then still smelling burn and wala it must have burnt my outlet out, plugged in to another outlet and it works now but my other outlet is not working now. Humm what to do?? Well will monitor and hopefully good things will come of this and it wont burn out this outlet. now should I keep this one and cancel the relacement or trade it off???"
3,Remote is not intelligent,"The remote for this product is sad. You have to re-program everytime you turn the fan on. And although the fan is very quiet, the light that shines from the top makes it look like you have a plane circling your bedroom!"
1,Poor Quality Control,I was unable to secure the base unit to the stand because when the main unit was installed to the exterior frame it was skewed.Making it impossible to use. When I called Honeywell they said I had to return unit b4 the would make good on their warranty.At that point the box was already destroyed and the internal packing thrown out.
4,Kept me cool during the hot summer months,I bought one of these fans for the hot summers of Berkeley California when I was going to summer school at University of California Berkeley and I liked it so much that I bought a second. The only problem with it was the fact that it was not as powerful as I would have hoped and therefore the fan wind force was a little weak for the size of the module and fan. The fan was quite a good price for what the machine can do and it does put out a nice amount of wind/breeze compared to fans of the same price. It also has many nice features like the filtering system that is easily cleaned by removing the back side and wiping the filter with a clean cloth. The timed shut off is also a nice convenient feature that allowed me leave the house with it on when I left the house or fell asleep at night. It looks sleek and modern as well so it is able to be in a corner seen and not look like a protypical fan that is an eyesore.
4,Product is great so far.,I purchased the product about 2 weeks ago and have been happily using it continuously. I have it in the bedroom in the desert and my dog stays in front of it while he is sleeping. Product came very fast from Amazon. Price is great and it looks good as well.
4,Wow.,"It's brass. It's rod. It's half and inch in diameter and 72"" long. They shipped it for free. What more can you want?"
3,Very traditional harlequin,The story was predictably cute and endearing. There was not much of a punch or intensity but it was a feel good story
5,clever mishaps,"I love this movie because of the clever mishaps, I laughed good and hearty, to me a good sign of comedy. WHEN WILL THIS MOVIE BE ON DVD? EVER? I AM LOOKING FOR IT"
5,Zukes,"To be honest, I ordered these to fulfill a 25.00 order and free shipping (thanks Amazon) My dog loves them! I break off 1/3 for her as they are a little big...plus she gets a million other treats as well! They have Rosemary, Tumeric and Sage in them and you can smell the aroma. They smell very good and Sadie loves the taste!"
5,Healthy Treats!,These are very appealing to my small dog. They are a healthy treat and I also appreciate the fact that they are make in the USA. I can highly recommend this product.
1,misguided,"I truly regretted buying this book. It dumbs down and contains minimal information. It lacks useful perspective, because it tries to sweep over all areas even-handedly, when their importance is clearly weighted."
4,Not your typical alphabet book!,"I work at a public library in the kids' dept., so when I saw another alphabet book I almost passed it by, but the picture on the front of the book of an alligator eating a salad really piqued my curiosity. ""A is for Salad??? What???"" I said, and had to open the book to see what was going on. I didn't just look at a page or two, but had to read through the whole thing - it was just so cute and had me smiling as I figured out what each letter REALLY stands for. Great to get kids thinking while having fun, each picture depicts an animal beginning with the featured letter engaged in some activity. For example, an alligator is eating a salad. There are a few animals, such as the iguana and narwhal, which have helpful clues as to the animals' identities hidden in the pictures. Kids may need help to identify the jellyfish and vulture, though."
5,malevolent creation and cannibal corpse jamming together,"if you put malevolent creation and cannibal corpse together in the same room, you wind up with hate plow. intense guitar, bass and drums, and bloody good lyrics."
2,A bit bizarre.,"This is a ""Stockholm Syndrome"" movie with sex as the means. The picture on the case is only a very small piece of what the victim went through."
4,Spectre 8136 Cone Air Filter,"Exactly as ordered - However, after I ordered I found the exact same thing at AutoZone for the same price. So, check around."
5,Amazing filter,This is THE air filter... It really improve the look and performance of my car (Renault Clio)... I recomended it 100%
3,"Good stuff, but pretty thin","When I first read AUTHORITY, I was blown away but just......how darn cool everything in it seemed. Its a masterpiece of style and force. And Frank Quietly is a suberp artist.I dunno, its not for everybody. It really could be, this book is so close to be a masterpiece it hurts. But it really doesn't seem to want to dig beneath the surface. Its just about action and truly incredible violence. But thats really about it. We dont get much of an idea of the characters, or really that the Authority does much else than wreack havoc on anyone that steps out of line.But jeez, if the story would just slow down, add some more details, really let us into its world, you'd be hard pressed to do better. Seriously, this book is ready to explode, there is so much there. It just feels like its content to burn out quickly."
5,Reggeaton Royalty,"After Barrio Fino, probably the most important CD in th genre. Don Omar will be the next crossover artist from this genre and this CD ranks him along the elite with TEGO and DY. A definite masterpiece, track after track. An announcement to the world: Puerto Ricans set the trend the rest of the world can follow. ""DALE DON DALE"""
1,These guys won't ever learn,"When will artists like Daddy Yankee, Don Omar, Tego Calderon realize that their music is garbage. Never have I heard a group of artists make one type of music for people who speak one type of language. And they wonder why music like this isn't big. It may be big in Puerto Rico but not here."
2,Not the quality I was expecting,"I bought this trunk based on all the great reviews. Maybe I have a new, cheaper model? One latch is too loose to latch. The other was installed so crooked it wouldn't latch at all. And the hole for the lock? Why bother? The plastic is so thin, it wouldn't take 15 seconds to cut through... Using finger nail clippers... Seriously... Nail clippers. But why even bother with that? The top is so flimsy I could leave the lock on, unlatch the cheap lockless latches, and lift the corners 4"", getting to everything inside.I'd return it, but then what? This trunk rated so well. Oh well. At least its ""Made in USA"", which I prefer. So I've decided it's just going to be easier (and patriotic?) to replace the two cheap, non-working latches with functional locking versions. And I will beef up the handle because I do not believe single rivets through that thin plastic are going to hold any weight."
1,Not worth my money!,I purchased two of these trunks to take with me on a deployment to Afghanistan. Both of them were broken in multiple places. I noticed that the box had minimal protectant around the trunks. So it was just cardboard around 90 percent of the trunks. I would have sent them back and purchased something else but I did not have enough time to send them back order something else. The quality of the plastic seemed to add to reason of them breaking. This is not by any means a heavy duty trunk. I was worried about the trunks crushing on the trip over and all of my personal stuff splilling out. I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THESE TRUNKS TO ANYONE.
1,Flimsy!,We bought these trunks to take items with us to Africa for a mission trip. They did not arrrive in one piece. Our previous experiences with trunks that LOOK like these was much better: the trunks survived several trips over and back! Neither of the two trunks made by this manufacturer made the return trip! They literally fell apart!
1,Wheel broke off first time I flew. One of the latches is loose. Very disappointed.,"Very disappointed in this product. A wheel broke off the first time I flew. The day I got it, one of the latches is loose.Wasted $40. I am asking for a replacement or my money back.Buy another brand!!!"
2,Storage Trunk,"I purchased this product for my son's use as scout summer camp. We found the latches to be very flimsy. In fact the first trunk we received had one of the latches broken off, when we opened the shipment. Amazon quickly replaced it. The trunk itself fulfilled its purpose, but the latches are poorly secured to the trunk."
2,Not good for campers !,"I got 4 trunks for my 4 children going to summer camp this july. The 4 trunks came back with the lid split in 2 . I was a bit surprised and my kids told me they had to step on the lid in order to climb on their beds !! so these trunks are certainly good for storage but not for campers ! Unfortunetly I will have to buy new ones next year, but heavy duty expensive ones I guess!"
5,The pact,This book kept me turning the page. I loved it. The ending haunted me. I wanted to read a sequel. I thought about it for days afterword.
3,Someone please spoil for me,I am a bit over half way through with this book and getting bored. Is there a surprise twist to it? Or am I going to truge through only to find that Emily was daunted over what is obvious by now and that's it?
4,liked it alot,"read her all the time.it was a hard subject matter and as she usually does,she did a good job.worth the read"
2,not too impressed,"I read ""My Sister's Keeper"" by the same author recently. While implausible in some places, it was a page turner, at least until the absurd ending with characters that you genuinely cared about.Unfortunately, this is not the same. Until I read it, I would not have believed that a novel about two young kindred spirits who make a suicide pact, and how the survivor deals with a murder accusation could be so dull. But it is.While I felt sorry for the protagonists, I never felt engaged with their plight. Perhaps this is due to the author, perhaps it was me. I have no idea."
2,Woiuld not recommend it,"The author had an interesting idea for the overall plot, but about half way through it just falls flat. The characters have no real level of depth, therefore you could really care less how things turn out for them. Especially Emily, who seems to, out of the blue, decide that suicide is her only hope. Also, the verdict for Chris at the end of the story is ridiculous. I also don't understand the sudo ""affair"" between the Emily's father and Chris's mother. It seemed to have no place in this story. I found myself intrigued by this book early on as it seemed like it would be a real page tuner, but it just turned out to be a big disappointment with too many ridiculous, irrelevant story lines and unanswered questions."
5,Best book,"I couldn't put this book down, I brought it everywhere with me and even read in the shower. I would recommend to everyone and anyone!"
3,Eh,Worth reading but not a favorite. I never really felt a connection to any of the characters. Not a page turner...
5,Amazing Read,"Prior to reading The Pact, I read several of Jodi Picoult books. Yet, The Pact exceeds the others by far and pulls at your heart unlike any other. Picoult tells the story of two families torn apart after their son and daughter are involved in a suicide. Picoult intertwines past and present, bringing us closer to the family members. She does a wonderful job at portraying the issue of teen suicide and writes a heart-wrenching novel that will leave you breathless until the very last word. I would definitely recommend The Pact, as it impacted me greater than any other novel I have read. Two thumbs up for Jodi Picoult!"
3,Not bad but seems to be a copy of other Jodi Picoult stories,"Gerat story for anyone who has not read Jodi Picoult before. However if you have, particularly if you've read 19 minutes, it's a bit of a waste of time. Feels exactly the same as other stories. Same plot, same parent characters, same style of framing things. Not much new here"
2,Disappointing,"I have read most of Jodi's books and this was the most disappointing one of all. I found it to be a bit draggy and melodramatic and only to find out that Em committed suicide because she was pregnant?!! Considering the family loved the idea of them falling in love and being family friends, I didnt see why Em would be so upset abotu being pregnant and its not as if the two families hated each other (aka Romeo and Juliet). So I found Em's character not having common sense and too dramatic. Aside from this though I did enjoy reading about the beginnings of both of their parents relationship, the same timing of pregnancies etc which explains the 2 stars rating otherwise it would have been a one star rating.But other than that I would not re-read this book at all unlike other books Jodi wrote."
2,Predictable,It was an ok read. Pretty predictable with lots of drama. Seemed like it was more the teen crowd. Kind of reminded me of an 80's TV movie of the week.
2,Just O.K.,Very American in content and values. This did not appeal to me.I found the plot and characters unrealistic.Not my cup of tea.
3,meh,"i felt so bad about this story. main question is ""why didnt Chris get her help?!"" icouldn't put it down though"
3,sad to think that some people feel like life is not worth living,This book was hard to read-you wanted to see if you could help the parents see what was actually going on with their teenagers-you just never know what is going on in someones mind.
2,disappointed,"I loved this book, until the end. I kept hoping that Picoult was going to wrap things up, bring closure, answer the unanswered questions and she never did. A very disappointing ending to a good read. The book goes nowhere, but an endless circle. The fiirst, and maybe the last Picoult I'll read."
1,"same old, same old","I knew this book was going to be bad after the first few chapters.It was so predictable. I could have guessed that Emily was going to be pregnant as this story line is used in other lame books. Chris just creeped me out, I could almost feel my own skin crawl everytime he had sex with Emily and the sex scenes between the parents could have been copied from some cheap, sleazy porn magazine. There was no suspense, Chris killing Emily was a given and to get the not guilty verdict was just laughable.If I could give this book no stars I would."
1,Awful,"I am so disappointed after finishing this book. None of my questions were answered and not in the good way where it's left to your imagination. The characters are superficial. We never get beneath the surface with any of them and least of all Emily. I feel I knew Emily the least and that is the character I really wanted, and felt I should, know deep down. So many aspects are hard to believe. I really wanted to like this book and thought I did while I was reading it but for it to be so heart wrenching and then come out with nothing is really frustrating!"
1,Disappointed,"I agree with other reviewers who were disappointed with this book. Although it was beautifully written, I felt cheated, ripped off, and let down at the end. The plot was not sufficiently developed through to the end. There were too many blanks to be filled in, too many loose ends, too much left unsaid and undone. There was far too much drama and not enough substance. I think it's fine to leave a few things in an ambiguous state at the end of a novel, to leave something to the reader's imagination, but c'mon, Picoult, FINISH THIS BOOK! Also, the storyline and dialogue during the trial got tedious and ridiculous. Was I, as the reader, supposed to feel any sympathy for Chris? I surely did not."
4,very enjoyable,"This was my first book I read by Picoult, I thought it was excellent, the only problem I had is why didn't Chris try a little harder to help the girl he loved so much? To me, that was a little unrealistic. I know in my current situation, if my boyfriend was talking and acting as she did, i would do everything I can to stop him, not help him.Otherwise, the book was good, I couldn't put it down."
5,The Pact by Jodi Picoult,"The Pact is an incredible story which makes anyone cry and ask many questions on what's going on in a teenager's head. Why do young people act the way they do and most importantly, why we the parents aren't aware of what they're trying to tell us with their actions. This book is with no doubt one of the greatest books of Jody, an amazing writer to whom I admire for being able to touch us with the points she makes with each one of her books!"
5,loved it,"This is the best book I've ever read.Although The Pact is a work of fiction, the content is so real to me. I cried throughout the whole book! I connected with the characters so deeply that I thought I knew them or that I was them. I am in a relationship much like Chris and Emily's and the love they share speaks volumes to me. I recommened this book for anyone and everyone.It is a totally life-changing experience."
1,Not impressed.,"I agree with ""Lily"" in when she says"" I definitely disagree with some of the reviews about the book being breathtaking and ""not able to put down."""".It dragged on a lot to me, and the jumping from past to present was a pain to read through, especially with multiple(!) points of view. I also had trouble really getting into it, I found the story lacked real depth/detail, color, and texture. For example, Emily Golde's character is talked about a lot but we hardly know anything about her. Why care so much about someone you know nothing about?I also expected a twist, some kind of interesting explanation for why the tragic event occurred, but I got nothing that satisfied me. I would say more but I do not want to spoil it for those of you that will read it anyway.This is the first and last book of hers I will read. I need something I can really get into.I read 'Water For elephants' before this book, and that book makes this book look almost like child's play."
2,Longest book ever,"This book just drug on for days. I kept waiting for the book to build, to my disapointment it was repetitive and long."
3,So sad,"I thought this book was interesting, but it was so sad. From the beginning, there was no hope for a happy ending. The book kept my attention and I wanted to continue reading, but I'm not sure why."
2,An Unsatisfying Exploration of Suicide,"As a survivor of suicide--my older brother died the same way Em did--I was expecting a rich, in-depth exploration of the reasons why someone would feel so desperate, she would take her own life. Unfortunately, this was terribly lacking. Em's reasons for committing suicide struck me as archaic and inadequate--even simplistic. The fierce love Chris's mother has for her son is deeply felt, but, after Em's death, her parents fade into the background. Even more troubling is the presentation of Chris's younger sister, who seems to be placed in the novel simply to serve as a counterpoint to Em. Overall, this was a disappointing albeit compelling read--by far, my least favorite Picoult novel."
2,Happy to finish.,"The Jacket to this book really caught my attention, what could have happened to these young lovers that would make them want to kill themselves. The book starts off with a Bang but quickly looses its momentum. I find Chris to be a believable character until he helps Emily put the gun to her head, Emily in my opinion is not very believable, if the two of them were so close she would have confided in him about the baby. This book drug at times and was painful at others....I was happy when I was finished reading it."
1,Vexed,I kept wondering why up to page 95 I was still getting the characters mixed up as to who was who and which couple was the parent of which child? Was there some deep meaning I missed in giving one of the women a man's name to make it all even more incomprehensible with zero dimensional characters mixed up in a go-nowhere plot? A tragic piece of fluff exploiting a seriously tragic social problem. Flashlight with dead batteries lost in a black hole.
4,A very good book!,"This is the first book that I read by Jodi Picoult. I was just passing by it in the book store and boy, am I glad I did!! The other two books I have read by Ms. Picoult are just as good as this one if not better. The Pact centers around two families: the Hartes and the Golds. They have lived next door to each other for years, raised their children together. So, it would only stand to reason that Chris Harte and Emily Gold grow up together and become lovers. It's almost like Chris and Emily are different halves of the same person. The readerreally becomes immersed in the book when Chis Harte is embroiled in the drama of a suicide pact gone awry. Jodi Picoult really has a knack for writing about rather disturbing subjects with a cast of characters that the reader really learns to care about."
5,The Pact by Jodi Picoult,I love all of Jodi Picoult's book. This one was as well-written as al the others. I highly recommend it.
4,"Terrific page turner, couldn't put it down","This is one of those relatively rare books which I read everywhere: standing in line at the grocery store, stirring dinner on the stove, at 2 in the morning while everyone slept. I found the story and characters very compelling and engaging, though some are drawn more thoroughly than others given the small cast. I did not see the end coming, which is definitely a huge plus in my book. I love being surprised, and this twist ending gave me just that! As other reviewers have noted, some portions of the story felt a bit contrived, hence the four stars. But honestly, I'd read it again despite that minor flaw. Enjoy!"
5,Like a Sucker Punch to the Gut!,"Did he or didn't he?That question plaques your mind after just a few chapters of The Pact. Picoult really stikes gold with the Hartes and the Golds, just your average upper/middle class perfect families until tragedy strikes. This novel is told with the use of flashbacks in both Em's and Chris' voice, in addition to their respective families, which shows that things are never what they seem (which I've been telling my mother for years). Sometimes boundaries are needed, and in this book its hard to figure out if its the parents, the kids, or the parents and the kids. I laughed and I cried, and cried somemore. To me, a novel that pulls at your emotions they was The Pact does is truly a well-written novel.Regardless, this book moved me so much I went straight to Picoult's website and decided to read more of her work. I thought it was a truly poignant story of what is happening across the country today."
4,"Enjoyed it immensely, until the end","I found this book in my house, having been left accidentally by someone. I picked it up out of boredom and was soon unable to put it down. It was a very compelling story, and the two main characters were developed extraordinarily well.But I found it ultimately unsatisfying. There was a major issue that was unresolved, and I felt that it needed to be explored in greater depth - especially Melanie's understanding of this issue.I also felt that the relationship between Gus and Michael could have been explored in greater detail.It was almost as if the author was under time pressure to get this finished, and did not have the time to fully wrap up some key details that had been introduced.Still, it was a good read and I would recommend it without hesitation."
5,A true page-turner!,"I truly recommend this book, I could not put it down. I read it for my book club and only 1 person out of 12 did not like it (that's a first!) It really digs into the lives of the 2 families represented and does a great job of telling the story- in detail. I love the way the story was written, and it's very easy to follow both the ""then"" and ""now"". Enjoy!"
3,Page Turner,"This book was the first I've read by Jodi Picoult and found that I could not put it down! However, in the end, I found that I wanted the loose ends to be tied up. For instance, what was in the diary that her mother found, read and burned? Who was sexually abusing her, if not her own mind with Chris? Maybe I just missed something. All in all, I think for myself, it's worth another read to find out."
2,Was this love?,"There have been many reviews of this book that point out the various flaws. My biggest complaint is that the character of Chris is presented as a loving and caring one, but actually his treatment of Emily was cruel. Who dared her to go in the men's restroom when she was nine? Who dared her to go down a ski slope that was too much for her, so she broke her leg? Who kept pushing her to have sex with him at age 15 when she repeatedly said no? And is it really love to let your best friend kill herself without trying to get help for her? With friends like Chris, who needs enemies? Chris comes across as an oppressive, possessive stalker, which might be the reason Em felt trapped. This type of unhealthy attachment is what the two sets of parents should have noticed."
2,I don't see the appeal,"I read this based on the recommendations of friends (moms ages 35-43). I did not like it. I admit I wanted to find out what happened in the end, but I did not enjoy reading it. I was desperate to finish it so I could be ""done"" with it. It is not just that the idea of a teen suicide is so painful to read about; it is that no one was terribly likeable in the book. I didn't relate either to the teens or to the moms. Also I found it not credible that the girl had never previously shown signs of depression. Yes, I know that family and close friends can ""miss signs"" of suicidal tendencies, and that there can be no signs whatsoever, but it seems there usually are signs of depression. Certainly the teen had reason to be disturbed and depressed, but the laying out of the story seemed neither revelatory nor explanatory. I just don't like it. Maybe it's better for a teen."
5,Jodi Picoult at her usual best,As usual Jodi Picoult has written a book that will keep you reading to get to the outcome of the story and give you another perspective. One view is not always the right one.
3,"Good, but not great . . .","I have read many books by Picoult and some of them are really outstanding. I found The Pact to be good, but not great. It is an enjoyable read, but nothing out of the ordinary. I didn't find the choices some of the characters made believable, and I was not happy with the ending."
5,Best strapless bra ever!,I've had my share of strapless bras in the past that were horrible! They had no support at all..and I'm only a 36-38B!I decided to give this bra a try because of the positive reviews and I was in need of a strapless bra. I'm happy I ordered this bra! It's so supportive and comfortable.Very happy with this product and thinking about ordering two more! Recommended to all the ladies out there!
5,"A ""Must"" for any true Reds Fan","This video is definitely a ""must"" for any Reds fan who has watched the team for years. It really has the greatest moments for the team on video. The first time I watched it I was surprised at how emotional I felt seeing these great moments all over again. It is definitely something that I will treasure for a long time. If you love the Cincinnati Reds, you need this dvd."
5,A MUST FOR ANY FIRST-TIME AUTHOR,"Connie Shelton's PUBLISH YOUR OWN NOVEL is THE book to have for the newly minted author as well as those with some experience. Even if you do not plan to publish your own novel, this book is full of detailed, and yet easy to understand, information on many topics. It is like having a kind, friendly guide sitting by your side as you launch your book tellintg you clearly and concisely what to do next and how to do it. I cannot praise this book enough!Sunny Kreis CollinsAuthor of KILL THE CLOCK"
2,Cool idea .. poor execution,"My daughter of 7 loves to use my Wacom tablet on my computer to draw with Painter so when I saw this I thought it would be a cool Christmas gift for her to hook up to the small TV I have and let her draw, paint whenever she wanted. I was totally disappointed though as the pen/pad response is awfull even for a toy. You really have to push hard in some cases to get it to react and there really isn't a good free form drawing mode. The pen also isn't even close to being accurate on where you click and frustrated my daughter after a while. She still occassionally plays with it but she had to learn the way to toy wanted to respond to touch and such which isn't anything like putting a crayon to paper. Maybe she got too used to my Wacom but I've had better toys from Leapster with better touch screen response than this one. I can't recomend this at all."
1,"Great concept, terrible execution","This toy has many clever features, but many of them are unusable due to poor hardware or software, I'm not sure which. For some of the activities, the images displayed on the TV screen are disjoint and out of sync, resulting in a ghost image shifted to the left.So, for example, when trying to use the drawing tool, the drawn line appears as expected, but a second dimmer line is drawn to the left at the same time. This makes it impossible to make any kind of acceptable drawing.Pity. It seems like it would be a lot of fun if it worked right."
4,Intermatic timer works well,"I have the Intermatic FD60MH 60-minute Spring Loaded Wall Timer wired to a towel warmer. It works quite well, but is a bit noisy. You can hear it ticking 10 feet away. It seems very well made and will probably be quite reliable over the years. Since the timer uses a spring mechanism, it does not draw power to use it, or in standby mode, as some digital timers do. The small form factor of the timer allows it to be installed in a double wall plate - with another switch next to it."
1,COMPLETE GARBAGE,"I'm not going to go in detail on this movie like most reviews, cause this movie is so terrible that it doesn't need to take anymore time from my life. Quite plain and simple, pass on this movie. It sucked BAD! I can't explain how awful it was. It seemed like a k-mart version Super Bad. No wait, more like a Dollar Store version. Just plain crap. I gave it one star, because I couldn't give it 0 stars. It's so bad, it's not even pirate worthy."
5,Best fan period.,"I have been wanting one of these fans for months. I live in a 1700 square foot house that is 2 stories. Its an old house and we have air conditioners in the windows. It keeps the place cool but not cold if you know what I mean. I placed the fan in front of the AC and point like they demonstrate in the instructions. Wow what a difference. I leave it on all day on low and the air circulates and keeps he place perfect. You really notice a difference when you come from upstairs. Please don't waste your money on cheaper fans. This one looks nice, its quiet, and circulates the air."
4,A nice piece of work by Trudy Desmond...,"When I heard this album, I fell in love with it straight away. My favourites in this album include ""I Got Rhythm"", ""Things Are Looking Up"", not to mention the catchy tunes in ""Promenade/Walking The Dog"" and ""Nice Work If You Can Get It"". It's really an album in which Trudy really sang Gershwin songs at her best ever... I recommend this album for those who also like vocalists such as Diana Krall, Laura Fygi, etc. If only she was still alive, I'm sure she'd release more great albums to enjoy in the future!"
4,Best coffee maker,This is easy and makes a very good cup of coffee. Learned that the right amount of coffee is the trick.
4,NATURALLY,"Trent Reznor is not one to mince with his music or lyrical direction. While tackling the Natural Born Killers soundtrack using various (and obviously influential) artists to thematically mark the violently graphic film, Reznor was fully involved with NIN's Self Destruct Tour with such acts as Marilyn Manson and The Jim Rose Circus.Anyone familiar with these acts know this soundtrack is almost organic by comparison. The drastic difference leaves one to ponder if the machine-like and synth sounds of his tour were inspiration for a change."
4,Great film,This movie is very hilarious and I love watching it over and over again because the acting is very funny and the comedy duo is awesome to watch! Jeff Goldblum is so laid-back that you laugh at most of his lines throughout the film!
3,"Fun, but I'm conflicted","I am a huge Anne Perry fan. That said, this book brought out mixed emotions. The way that Perry deals with the characters is of course always a delight, and I'm particularly a Vespasia fan.I think Perry was using this book to be experimental. The book's not so much a whodunit as it is a whydunit, in my opinion. That said, one of the things that I enjoyed about this book is that it breaks with Perry's tradition of introducing the solution within literally the last 5 pages. More often than not, even her longer works may drag the mystery until the very end, leaving no real closure.It's not a book for everyone, and some mystery buffs might even say that it breaks a cardinal rule. That said, I enjoyed it."
3,Boring...,"This is one of Perry's earlier books. It is quite repetitive. You skip around inside the minds of the main characters, as they think over and over and over and over again about the possible reasons for three murders. It's like Perry had a glimmer of an idea about the murders, but then she didn't know what to do with it. The book makes no progress for three-quarters of the pages. The word ""anarchy"" or ""anarchist,"" as a possible reason for the murders, occurs time and time again. The book is boring, but you keep reading in fits and starts, hoping that suddenly there will be some insights or progress. Neither Pitt nor Charlotte, his wife, nor anyone else has a clue, though, about the murders. Also, Perry's attempt to echo late 19th-century phrasing is often too long and windy and unclear. Some of her sentences and trains of thought don't make any sense."
1,LF,"It is nice but the sizes are very wrong, I bought M and this is at least large and maybe XL. You should buy an smaller size. Unfortunately I removed the prize before noticing so I will give it someone bigger."
3,Runs large,"Great golf shirt for warm weather, stays cool and it is pretty comfortable. The only problem is that runs very large. I am a large and bought this shirt medium and it still runs a bit large."
5,Just Buy It,"One of the best albums I've ever heard. Noise-art-punk-metal at its absolute best. Complex song structures, fantastic production, ""inspired"" lyrics, and thick guitar noise make this a great album from one of Texas' finest. If you don't like this album, there is something very wrong with you...or maybe there's just something very wrong with the rest of us...whatever..."
4,Essential reference for larger projects,"I use this book extensively as a landscape architect for medium to large scale projects such as parking lots, parks, and streets. It is not a residential lighting book, although I do use the ""patterns"" shown here even at a small scale. My only complaint -- it is time for a new edition, incorporating LEDs and the advances in CFLs."
2,Beware home owners!,"If I had been looking for a book on commercial residential lighting,(apartments), this would have been an excellent book. Single home lighting patterns are not included."
1,Bumble Bee Lamp shade,"Wile I do love this lamp shade It it very hard to find a lamp that it fits. None of the lamps sold at home depot, lowes, target or walmart fit this shade properly. We got a lamp and screwed some plumbing hardware to it to hola the shade on. Beware when buying this. It is hard to find a lamp bace"
3,okay,"My one song that I loved on this CD was Glycerine. The other songs on the CD don't sound as good as it , or its just the way he sings them."
2,Poor customer service,"I purchased this flashlight for law enforcement duty; within a week of when I started using it, the rubber power button fell off the flashlight. I was lucky enough to find it in a parking lot, and I replaced it, but within two more days of use, the button vanished again, this time for good. I've spoken to at least two other people with similar problems using this model of flashlight.Streamlight so far has been completely unresponsive to my requests for customer support, neither returning my voice mails nor my e-mails. It's an impressive flashlight that casts a good beam, but for the one moving part to fail twice within the first two weeks of use is unacceptable. Even more unacceptable is their refusal to communicate with their customers. This flashlight is simply too expensive for poor customer service. I've already decided that when I buy a tactical light for my pistol, it won't be a model made by Streamlight."
4,"Lots of parts and good finish, not as solid as I would wish",I used this with a Panasonic PT-AR100U. It fit fine with the various spacers provided and additional long arms to create the five arms needed for for this projector. It is hard to tighten the pan and tilt bolts as there is little space between the ceiling and the projector. Even when tightened it is still a bit less solid than I would like. I think it stems from the small diameter vertical pipe locking assembly.All in all a good but not great mount. Lots of screws and spacers and extra arms with various lengths should work with a wide range of projectors. Instructions are OK.
4,Good and inexpensive,I am using the with my epson 8350 projector. It is working well so far. Assembly was simple mounting was not to bad. The good is that it is very adjustable. The con is that there is no fine adjustment. Basically it is easy to get it in the ball park but if you are expecting to be able to adjust the mount a millimeter you should go for a high end model. It works well for me and would not hesitate to suggest to anyone doing a budget install.
1,Universal?,"So I purchased this mount for my new Epson 8350, the arms do not reach the screws and I had to attach them where they would reach... low and behold the projector is now lop sided as is the viewing area."
1,bad,was differnt then what the picture was and the discription got no responsons from the seller still
1,Poor Picture Quality,"I don't feel Red Sonja is any better or worse plot wise than Conan The Destroyer. However I found the picture quality to be one of the poorest I have seen on DVD. It resembled that of an old VHS. There were white creases in the print; not distracting but noticable, and the picture was grainy throughout, sound had a slight muffled quality to it, not crisp.I own about 500 DVD's and counting, don't write reviews because there are many of you out there that write really good ones. But what I will do from now on is share with the rest of you when I come across poor transfers."
4,It's every woman's role model.,I grew up on this movie. I always wanted to learn swordsmanship so I could fight like Sonja. Sonja is strong and encourages women to be part of the tough crowd. There are no damsels in distress in this movie! GO GIRL!
3,Great Conan-Esque Movie,"If you're even looking this up, I'm sure you are a fan of the Conan Movies, Willow, Krull, Beastmaster, etc. Yes, it is another fun and exciting little cheesy Sword and Sorcery film. This one does a good job with blending action, humor, and fantasy into a simple and fun film. If you're looking for an intense movie, try something like Fight Club, but this is one of those movies that you turn your brain off and just enjoy.There is a lot of cheese in this movie, but I think its up to par with Conan The Destroyer, and much better than Kull The Conqueror. If you're looking for another Robert E Howard style Hyborian Age tale, try this one for size."
3,Its an 80s thing,"Skimpy clothes, swords, monsters, revenge, Its got it all - and a script that is easy enough for a child to understand. Cult classic that it is - although who knows why. It could have been a great movie, Brigitte Nielson and Arnold Swarzenegger taking a back seat (although not by much), best thing about the movie was the music - powerful and dynamic, it carried the movie along enough to make the watcher stay till the end."
1,What the hell?,"This was a really bad movie. First, Ernie Reyes Jr. when he was a little kid in a Schwarzenegger movie. It's painful. Brigitte Nielsen can't act and she's not even THAT good looking. Sub-par plot (An evil queen wants a jewel) And even the fight scenes were drug out. Nielsen is so frail that everyone is pulling their punches, sword blows, etc. So, it really slows down the action. Maybe if she didn't have a bigger sword than Arnold she could fight a little better.And the evil queen? She was in the first Conan movie! I thought she was WAY hotter than Red Sonja!If you want to know why they didn't make a Conan 3, watch this movie. Bad all around."
4,"Conan 3 ""in search of redhead hotness""","This is a great movie which I used to introduce my younger sister to the world of fantasy. Guys, seriously... if your women don't care for the action/adventure movies, find movies with female leads. As I titled this review, I would almost consider this Conan 3, It's got Arnold Schwarzenegger swinging his sword again and with the hotness of Brigitte Nielsen in a skimpy leather outfit. Those who enjoy Xeena would probably also enjoy this.My reasons behind not giving this 5 stars would be that it's NOT Conan, it's just Arnold playing a very very similar role and the attempt at comic relief of ""fat guy & annoying brat"" really wasn't funny, it was just annoying.I didn't notice any damage in the product and the packaging is typical for a single disc DVD, nothing fancy."
1,hit or miss if it will work,"Evidently I'm not the only one, but i too had to purchase this DVD twice, and both times return them cause the dvd did not work properly . The dvd skips and freezes and i was only able to view a few songs in their entirety. What little of the shows that i did see looked awesome, and if it werent for alot of them being obviously defective this dvd would be a big seller i would think. I wouldnt waste my time though until the flaws are fixed."
1,Shame on you !!!,I received this DVD but it can`t be read in my DVD player ! WTF !!! Beware with your purchases in the future !!!
3,"decent, but not amazing","There aren't enough shades of this to match everyone. The coverage is good, but the texture can be hard to work with, and sometimes it can be a little TOO much coverage for the undereye area."
3,Good concealer,"I have tried lots of concealers, and I am still on the lookout for the perfect one. This one, however, is better than most I have tried. A little goes a long way, and it's easy to use too much. It does work wonders if you have a little imperfection, all it takes is a little dab and it covers it well. It lasts a very long time, I have had my tube for quite a while."
5,best concealer,this is the best concealer i've ever used!!!! my skin is on the warmer side(half-japanese) and the color is perfect. you only need to use the smallest amount to cover imperfections. highly recommend this product!!!!
4,Cheese State Phantasmagoria,"Linda Godfrey does a commendable job with 'The Beast of Bray Road', a heady chronicle that is one part record of bizarre recent events, one part compendium of esoteric Midwest folklore. As an avid consumer of books on related subjects written by the likes of Loren Coleman, John Keel, Ivan Sanderson and Brad Steiger, I was very pleased with Godfrey's approach to Bray Road's werewolf-like phantoms, and I think this book measures up well in the company of those Fortean giants. There's nothing 'New Age' here to muddle up the weird stories Godfrey recounts. Theories are offered, sometimes with tongue firmly planted in cheek, but those seeking concrete answers to Wisconsin's werewolf flap need to look elsewhere. As with all classics of the Fortean oeuvre, Godfrey leaves it up to the reader to deal with the reality-defying geometry of the events described herein. Highly recommended. Look forward to reading the sequel."
1,Didnt work long,The product only worked for about 2 months. I have had previous foggers that worked for years from other companies. I will not purchase from this company again.
4,Excellent first half!,"The first half of the album was ""right on"" ! The quality of the bonus tracks was severely lacking....fuzzy and garbled. I couldn't even stand to listen past the first bonus track!I bought the cd to recreate a favorite old album and I was not at all disappointed! I merely turn it off after the original ""Crusade"" tracks."
5,Christmas cookies from the Whimsical Bakehouse,Service was excellent and prompt. The book arrived in excellent condition. Triple A-OK satisfaction on our part. Thanks.
2,"Refrain from makin a stupid cartoon, make another mario game","Ok, let me start off by saying that this game is a very poorly developed game. The creators and publishers of this game should be very disappointed. Yippee, we made a piece of junk! I hear the profits will be $10 because only stupid ol' blockbuster will buy the game! That is what I probably would've said after creating this heap of metal. When you create monsters, they all look the same and have the same color. Then you have BUY the colors at the shop. You can only have one blob at a time. The minigames are very EASY and you will beat it in one day, double the amount of time it took me."
1,Not worth a Quarter at a yard sale,"I had read the previous reviews on here about it being a great book, he teaches the kids in a talented way about the constitution, etc. I suppose I should have read the reviews with the not impressed with it. I was deeply disappointed with this book. I don't see where it teaches a child anything. It was not at all what I expected. I would not buy this at a garage sale for a quarter. I might for ten cents if my kid wanted it. It was not worth the price paid for it. The reviews on here talking about it being excellent, teaching, etc are very misleading. Granted it is one's opinion. It is a book I would label for the trash bin. I would not recommend this book to anyone. If you want a book to teach your child about the constitution, search elsewhere. This wont do anything and you'll be urked over buying it under misleading terms."
3,Lesson for the Constitution,Used the book in for a lesson to first-graders on the Constitution. The storyline using the pictures was very good. The children enjoyed it. As for me I really had to stretch my imagination to coordinate the Preamble to the particular picture-story. I did feel that my objective was met because the Preamble was intoduced to the children in a fun way. I may use the book again next year. It was worth the purchase.
5,Best Shower Rod Ever!,"Best dang shower rod ever ""The Arc"" and the hookless shower curtain is a dream. No more stupid hooks getting hung up or jumping loose. Those crudy shower curtain rings coming unsnapped. No more hassle period. Just a larger more spacious shower and a smooth sliding shower curtain. I wish I had thought of this. Everyone should get this!"
5,inspiring,"Rules for the Unruly inspires and delights with wisdom and funny stories . . it's a book to share yet keep for those days when you feel discouraged. Marion Winik has a flowing, pleasing writing style that sounds conversational yet so well put together. And her life story is intriguing, such that I'm curious to read her memoirs. Definitely the perfect graduation present!"
5,Simply a stunning and beautiful book!,"Helen Gibb has once again prepared a book that not only teaches the art of ribbonwork, but is an eye appealing treasure, blending directions for creating ribbonwork pieces of today with those of the past. Beautiful examples of past treasures have been painstakingly arranged and photographed. The book is enjoyable to peruse just to marvel at the beautiful antique pieces she displays. Her love of the antique handwork is evident and her work is tasteful and eye appealing. Helen's first ribbonwork book was beautiful and her new book is another example of her high quality and standard."
4,Exactly as advertised,"This book is exactly what it says it is (how very German). It is a handbook that you can use on a daily basis to improve your dressage. In the front there are chapters on such things as a riders duty to the horse, the correct seat, tack and training facilities.There are then general tips on creating the foundations for dressage and training such as developing lateral bend or forward thrust and then the chapters begin on advanced dressage exercises such as pirouettes, schaukel or flying changes. Each are described in full, there are exercises to improve the quality of each, problems to avoid and special notes for the rider.An excellent book to have in your library. It's not a barrel of laughs to read but certainly gives you many many exercises to work through and many good tips for improving both your riding and your horse's way of going."
1,hardly representative,"Mahoney's book has many many flaws. Number one, she approaches her subject with a condescending, superior attitude of ""I'm an enlightened American feminist looking at these backward Irish people."" She then interviews many Irishwomen: lesbians, abortion activists, anti-abortion activists. . All of these people are cartoons and she never seems to get around to interviewing more typical Irishwomen who for the most part are religious Catholics with conservative views but certainly aren't the extreme fanatics or the radical feminists Mahoney describes. I spent some time in Corofin several years after this book came out and the hatred of Mahoney remains. I can attest that while Corofin has some characters, they aren't the pathetic freaks she describes."
1,A travesty on both author and Irish women,This book is a travesty on the author and on Irish women. The author obviously did not get in touch at all with the Irish culture and how she herself was being treated. There is a long tradition in Ireland of making fools of 'outsiders' - Irish literature is full of such pranks. The author obviously fell into the trap. This is not a good description of how Irish women live or feel. I actually laughed out loud at some of the dour parts - the author did not get the satire or the tricks behind some of the women she interviewed. One needs to be very subtle to talk to the Irish - talking everything at face value is a mistake.
2,All of you got ribbed off....You have to pay for this ???,"This was a 1 page instruction in my kung fu manual.Wow, it is so easy to make money in America,maybe I should translate books too andsay I am a master.Go to Baidu and search videos for'''''"
2,I wouldn't bother,"Got a handful of problems with this semi-helpful guide.It doesn't give you the full info on status changes. For example, when you get out of the baths your status screen has a gold ball next to each character. What does that mean? I DON'T KNOW! And the guide does not tell you.It gives incorrect information on recruitment. There are a few of the Stars of Destiny that are unattainable if you strictly operate by what's in the guide.I'm not sorry I bought it, but I highly advise you take a pass on this one and find an online walkthrough and print it."
1,"Terrible writing, just can't stand this author's ""voice""","Ugh, really, I have to read more about this author's opinion? Good lord, please kill me. Seriously, this author should have stuck to bullet points, the book would be about 25 pages and would have been EVER so much more pleasant. Thank goodness I only grabbed this from the local library, I'd kick myself if I ever bought this garbage. Seriously: bad."
3,About what you would expect,"This was the required textbook for my technical writing class, and as you might it expect, it covered all the topics necessary, but there was nothing ground shaking about the book.If you need serious help with your writing, this is not the book to turn too. If you are looking for a guide book that covers many common formats, the book isn't bad, but all the information is easier to find on the net."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I saw this movie at the Tampa International Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in 2005. It was the WORST movie of the Festival -- even most of the Board of Directors thought so. It somehow slipped through the cracks. One of my friends, who is Italian by birth and speaks French fluently, was so turned off by the movie that he refused to come to the Festival for the next night's foreign film. THAT movie, Cote d'Azur, was excellent.But back to Three Dancing Slaves - ugh, yuck and no thanks! Senseless, violent content and not a gay movie at all."
3,Brians Hunt,I lke this book but it is sort of slow moving with all the hunting and the camp he goes to and stays at.
4,Perhaps the best in American prog.,"This late seventies prog release sounds magnificent with it's recent re-mastering. Everything is crystal clear and vibrant. The music itself is equally brilliant. With the lone exception of the fifth cut this is an instrumental outing. Still, the sense of melody and composition throughout is arresting. The only time they stumble is when they attempt to provide vocals. They are clearly much stronger and original when sticking with the instrumental format. Brilliant musicianship througout. I do not hear where comparisons can be made to Genesis or Gentle Giant. There is a much stronger connection to the music of early Dixie Dregs (What If, Night of the Living Dregs) and the first Shadowfax album, Watercourse Way (their only prog recording-subsequently their only worthwhile release). It was a pity that they disbanded shortly after this recording as they had considerable talent and ability. This one is well worth purchasing...Simon"
3,It has good and bad!,"How should i put this, it was not my cup of tea.Babes with guns and offcourse, big assets. I really didn't like this show, but i didn't dislike it either. As you can see by the ratings i put it in a middle ground. The story was paper thin with no twists or plot changes. The girls personalities didn't have a chance to develop. And the big ""assets"" i talked about just doesn't work for me, it's just playing silly. Average story with a lack of character development."
2,a total bad ending to a possibly good anime,It could of been a 3 star anime but the ending was awful just like in that movie battel angel (my teacher uses these three words im about to say) I HIGHLY SUGEST you buy somthin else cause a popular charcter died in the end i cried im very sensitive ok enuffa that I Will list 3 other god animes 1 sorceror hunters 2 dirty pair original 3 macross plus or any thing but this ADV made a bad mistake but ADV has made me so happy that can forgive the company
5,Stranger in a strange land never sounded so sweet,"I usually take comfort in comprehending the words to a song. But the foreignness and disturbing atmosphere that Natacha Atlas' Egyptian vocalizations created in my house were not only intriguing but soothing. She possesses the gift of transference in that her message is felt and not needed to be lyrically comprehended. Though, with one perusal of the lyrics of the album, the listener is also swept away by the beauty of the message. She has a strong, mesmerizing voice which eased my anxiety and compelled me to invest more of my time in practicing Eastern arts such as meditation and incense burning. This album is a welcome addition to my collection and a recommendation for all beings who wish to branch out from the normal genres of music being offerred to date."
4,SWEETER THAN SWEETS!,For belly dancers: The best tracks are 6 through 12. This CD is more emotional and romantic than the Diaspora. The lyrics are remeniscent of Om Kolthoum. Natascha Atlas has a voice legends are made of!
4,4 stars,"After first hearing this album, I was somewhat disappointed. I still think Diaspora is one of her best works. It feels like shes trying too hard or something on this album. Though there are a few good tracks. I was also expecting more since Jaz Coleman of Killing Joke fame produced some tracks. Overall, not bad, but not great."
2,Doesn't Blow My Skirt Up,"I study Middle Eastern dance and Natacha Atlas came highly recommended within my dancing circles. While she is, unarguably, a fine and passioante vocalist this album does not appear to be her best work. I plan to give some others a listen, but would recommend anyone into the Egyptian music scene to start their collection elsewhere."
5,NO Overstatement: The Greatest Stories Ever Told!,"Well, maybe a little bit of an overstatement. But I did find them more humorous than The Bible (except for that Job, he could bring me to tears). Funny, hip and way smarter than you and I, Ruben Bolling is a man for all seasons (except Fall and Winter). Do yourself a favor and enjoy some quiet time, but after that's over grab this book and laugh uproariously!"
4,Buried Treasure,"This book is a must-have, if only for its documentation of Choctaw prophecies, and included thematic list at the end. The discussion of the performance of prophecy, and other scholarly tripe, lend very little to this book's value. The people who were interviewed by the author, however come alive, and the poignancy of many of the prophecies they recall/convey become immediately apparent."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I have always been impressed with Vornado products. Therefore, I was lured into purchasing this fan when it arrived in my ""Gold Box"" as a special purchase. However -- as the saying goes -- all that glitters is not gold. My Vornado fan arrived broken: The front protective grill is made out of cheap plastic, and due to one of the plastic clips being broken, the front grill will not stay in place. It literally falls off.Despite that, I still tried to use the fan. The fan produces a ""stream"" (tunnel) of air into one location, and does not cool a wide area.If you want a fan that will only direct air into one spot, this fan might be fine. But if you want over-all all-room cooling, this is not a good choice."
4,Kind of has an odd texture?,It feels weird when you put this on your body (I thought) Difficult to rub in and I don't have time to be waiting for it to soak in on it's own
5,Love 'em,Very stylish and well-built. Super-comfy from Day One. I've been wearing them nearly every day for the past few weeks.
2,Your Funds are Better Used Elsewhere,"I just used this book for to create figures for my senior thesis and a poster for a psychology conference. I did not find that this book served my interests.For creating posters: it only outlined the basics, which were pretty much intuitive; inlude an intro, method, results et cetera. I found better instruction and examples by searching the web. I wanted more information about style and color use.For tables and figures: the important things you need to know about figures and tables can be found in the APA writer's manual. The only bonus is that there were a lot more examples in this book.My advice is to borrow this book from a library or friend before you commit to purchasing it - its not worth cost."
1,a book for beginner,"If you already know how to operate a dSLR and know how to take some basic photos, nothing useful here."
4,A NAGGING FEAR,"Varied as it is, Cale's work has always presented a confusing amalgam to my ears. ""The Academy in Peril"" is a rare accomplishment and ranks as one of the best of its time. ""Drella"" is self-indulgent nonsense and in my opinion should be considered as some of the worst of pretty much any time. As for the period-defined music of ""Fear"" (with its ""Before and After Science"" cover art as well as its then de rigueur Eno collaboration) let's just say that it's been a lot of years and I still can not get the bass intro to ""Barracuda"" out of my head. That and the fact that Barracuda's chorus -- by 2007 clearly prescient and naggingly accurate -- ""the ocean will have us all..."" may in fact prove to be true in more ways than we may have originally guessed. Which means that Fear will likely survive even as we each perish."
4,The best album before the ambience kicked in,"This album represents the tunning point for the band. It's accessible to most fans, it's got the earlier metal and hint of the next few works that were much mellower trance/ambient (in my mind) nonsense. It was probably a sign of the times and luckily the latest album is a brilliant return to business as usual. Check out ""super fragmente"" if you liked the earlier works."
4,Basically another Uriah Heep CD. Interesting and rare!,"David Byron released this solo LP in 1975, stemming from his success with Heep. This CD features Mick Box and Lee Kerslake as special guests!?!? Why was this not a Heep album? I'd say about 3/4 of the album is great. David expands his horizons here a bit. The highlights are, ""Man Full Of Yesterdays,"" ""Steamin' Along,"" ""Roller Coaster,"" ""Sweet Rock And Roll,"" ""Love Song,"" and ""Midnight Flyer."" Worth the price because of it's out-of-print status, and rare characteristics. David later formed Rough Diamond, which was not as successful, and rightly so. David is still a tremendously underrated vocalist even today."
2,Dissapointed,"I was dissapointed when I listened to this cd. All I wanted was the original version of the Perfect Drug. This cd only has the remixes. So if you're buying this cd for the original version, you should just as well buy the soundtrack for the Lost Highway instead."
1,I own DOZENS of NIN cd's. this is the WORST one.,"I am not trying to brag, but at one point NIN was my favorite band, and as an obsession and hobby, I collected EVERY single CD short of a few Jappense imports, and RE-realesed copycat UK imports, I have EVERY single NIN cd ever made, plus half a dozen bootlegs inculding the rare Rusty Nails megamixes 1 and 2. My point of all this is that: If any is one, I am a Nine Inch nails expert when it come to their music. I have heard every single song NIN ever made plus remixes or unrealsed orginal version of a lot, live versions, and unrealsed instrumentls that Trent did whith a few. The ""prefect drug"" the song is one of the Best songs Trent ever did, and I am sad to say this album is the worst album trent let have the name Nine Inch nails on it. Not only, but It is the ONLY NIN album I dont like, thats how bad it is."
2,Rather disappointed with the cd.,"The cd would actually have been worth the purchase if the original version of the song had been on there. It figures that Reznor finally comes up with something that sounds good, and decides not to publish it on, of all things, the ep of that title..."
2,The isn't worth getting. Get the import instead.,"Although the remixes weren't half bad, they lacked the vocals of the original. That just removes the reason for buying it. For a few extra bucks, go with the import, it has everything the US version does, plus the original."
4,impressive debut,"Infectious synthpop from a talented duo on the A Different Drum label. Each and every song on Native Anger impresses me. Beats and hooks on this album often border on aggressive and at times even EBM-esque. Not much fluff here! Most tracks follow the formula of building up slowly to a climatic chorus. Stand-out tracks include ""Balance of Minds"" and the somber ""Midnight Son.""If I had to choose some other bands to compare The Nine to, I'd have difficulties. They are one of the more unique synthpop acts today, vocals- and music-wise, even on this debut. Give it a chance."
2,disappointment about purchase,"the book is a new and very abridged copy of the original edition and I had very clearly asked for a used book! The book you sent me is a Bibliobazaar reprint. No vphotographs, no bibliography, a useless index and inexpertly abridged. Shortly very unsatisfactory and I am disappointed about my purchase.The book by Carl Lumholtz is very good and interesting but it is a pity that it appeared in this Bibliobazaar edition"
5,Mike Dooley is always great!,I always enjoy any thing that Mike Dooley has published. This was no exception for me. Really enjoyed it and would purchase other items the author and speaker has released.
3,Final sips of greatness,"3 1/2Perhaps Claypool's last stab at artistic greatness. Although the album indulges his quirky hell-billy side a little too often to stand with his greatest previous releases, the oddball songs grow on you while witnessing a playfully personal synergy this original trio carried, one last time."
5,End of an era,Most people wouldn't call this their favorite Primus album but I think it is the most Primus-like of all. I'd say it's one of their best. Les creates a balance between his 6-string fretless and the 4-string. Pork soda and Seas O cheese were all fretless and I don't think he's used it since. Too bad. Grapevine is one of my favorite songs and I've even heard Wynona on the radio. This album got me into Primus and saved me from the aforementioned seas of cheese
1,Totally Incompatible with INTEL PA 3000,"I purchased this item with at the same time as the Intel Personal Audio Player 3000 and had instant trouble. I attempted to download songs to the card several different times and as soon as the last song would finish it would erase all other songs on the card an duplicate the last song numerous times! Then, when the card was removed from the player the player didn't recognize the internal memory! I contacted Intel and they came back and stated that they have had reports of this happening with SanDisk 64 cards since March. They had reports of every detail of the problem I experienced. I sent the card back and ordered a card from a different manufacturer that has no reported problems. Not impressed with SanDisk! In my opinion this card should not even be offered for sale until SanDisk sort out the issue!"
5,full of hip hop and rock,"This album is the best i have heard! Full of diferent sounds and styles for everyone. Hardcore rap on ""CHUCK"" or nice smooth punk on ""people piss me off."" Definatly worth listening to 24-7."
4,Try the Trit,"Though not as well recorded or luxuriantly cast as some other recordings, this is a performance one would be thoroughly satisfied with in the opera house. If, like me, one has an aversion to listening to the same big names in everything, this is worth exploring."
4,Redundant,"I would give this five stars, except for a problem in the editorial review here on Amazon - it leaves out the most important piece of information. The back cover tells us this book is ""focused readings chosen from the best-selling Moments Together for Couples."" We already own (and love) ""Moments Together for Couples"" and ""Moments with You"" by Dennis and Barbara Rainey.Had I known it was an excerpts book, I would not have purchased it. That's like buying a Greatest Hits album when you already own the whole collection."
3,Hoped it would be funnier!,"There have been many knock offs of Don Novello's (sp?) letter campaign book, and although this had a few funny ones, it wasn't as political as Novello's or downright sidesplitting as Paul Rosa's ""Idiot Letters."" Seems he had a few good letter ideas, and then had to fill in the rest of a very slim book. Also--the formula is very similar to Rosa's. Good for a few--emphasize FEW--laughs."
3,The Title Says It: Plain,"The title of this book says it all: plain. This book was not exciting or enticing. I made it to the end only because of sheer will power. The back of the book says Jane was ""shrewd, bright,"" but all I found was a one dimensional woman who was very far from shrewd or bright. The author kept saying Jane was the smart child of the Seymour children, but it felt to me like lip service. Like how Jane appeared to fall into shrewdness in attracting the king by following social norms between men and women.In fact, most of the characters felt one dimensional, with all actions propelled by simple forces, with no complexity. One example would be Henry VIII's desire for Anne Boleyn was physical only. Overall, not interesting. I suggest reading another Henry VIII novel."
1,const quality 0,"Fell apart while installing. Completely unusable. Holding collar too thin. Threadstoo fine, front flange too small and thin. Nothing to hold while tightening.PYLE PLCM22IR Flush Mount Rear View Camera with 0 Lux Night Vision"
3,Inexpensive camera that gets the job done,"I use two of these cameras on my car in place of my side view mirrors. They work well during the day, but have trouble if the sun is shining into them. The night vision mode only works for a few feet behind the vehicle, after that you're out of luck. Also, if dirt, snow or rain gets on the lens, the camera will focus on it and will basically wash out the rest of the image. So make sure you mount the cameras in a location on your vehicle that will be less likely to get dirty or wet."
3,PYLE PLCM22IR Flush Mount Rear View Camera with 0.5 Lux Night Vision,"The PYLE PLCM22IR Flush Mount Rear View Camera with 0.5 Lux Night Vision for the price this camera is OK. At day light the vision quality is good but at night with lights at the back the vision is acceptable and with no ligths at he back the vision is unacceptable. I also have a backup sensor installed and that's makes me feel more secure at the time of backup at night time. Some time ago I had been hit from the back (It was not a Big impact) and the impact was not over the camera, but after that, the Video comes with some distorsions or interferences. But the my daily issue is the dust and dirty that the camera gets on the crystal, so in the Night is a big deal beacuse view is blocked. Thank You..."
3,Weak power connection wires. Low light - insn't,"The wires for the power connection are way too small for my taste. I ended up hard-wiring to the power feed line. The connection itself is poor and tended to short/disconnect. The night vision isn't. Low light - maybe. Helps to have a little electrical/mechanical savvy to install. It functions for the purpose it was intended, not as marketed."
5,Way Best Bang :) for the Buck!,"Be sure to get the Red ones. The colors on the Radians Competitors mean something. In this case Red means softer rubbery ear cups. I have glasses with fairly thick metal ear pieces. These attenuate the sound about the same whether or not I have the glasses on. BTW, the Blue ones have vinyl ear cups - stiff and much colder in the winter."
1,dissapointed,"I ordered this for my grand-daughter and was dissapointed when it arrived and I saw that it was for a doll. The description made no mention of this. I purchased this for her to play IN. It listed the recommended ages and not the size of the tent. In addition to the dissapointment of seeing a doll tent, I had to pay shipping when I purhchaed the item and when I returned the item."
3,"Well wtitten, but not a five star read for this reader...","I cannot deny that this book was well written. LK knows how to tell a story and write interesting characters. I wasn't blown away by this book however. It had it's moments of greatness that made me smile and tear up, but it failed to keep me clued to the pages. I found myself being anxious for it to come to it's conclusion towards the ending when the sword storyline took precedence over the romance. I was also hoping for Samuel to reassure the reader that he wasn't in love with Lady Caroline anymore, but it never happened the way I wanted it to. I know he declared his love for the heroine but he was so obsessed with Lady Caroline when he was forced to marry the heroine that I found it hard to believe that he would just stop wanting to be with her. I didn't give up reading it though, so it was interesting enough to read, but just wasn't as spectacular as I was expecting it to be."
2,Couldn't Get Into The Book,"I guess I am not really a fan of Laura Kinsale's writing style. I just have a difficult time getting involved in the story--she writes about very foreign and exotic places, uses a lot of native language...it is not the typical romance novel. I am a huge fan of Judith McNaught, Lisa Kleypas, Gaelen Foley...and Kinsale's books (I have now tried to read 3) are just a completely different style--unfortunately, not to my liking. The novels are not ""beach reads"" or ""escape"" books. They are very intense--too intense for me!"
2,dissapointing,i was dissapointed with this guide book ... not so much because of the information it contained but because the maps were ilegible and therefor useless ...also because the information was not available easier by a detailed index ... i had to flic thru the pages to find the section i needed so in my opinion poorly laid out ...it felt to me more like someones impression of the place rather than factual information which i would have prefered ...
2,What about Liberia?,"I was disappointed Liberia wasnt included in this edition, I was unable to find that explained before I bought it"
3,Good but nothing new,If your a christian music fan then this will be something new for you because Christian music hasnt tried it yet. Unfortunately to us with a wider (and more matured) taste of music this will just be another wannabe punk/emo band that cant get its feet of the ground.
5,Disciple will Rise Up,This CD is Amazing Disciple has captured a fresh new sound that combindes the elements of Rock.Metal and Grunge this CD Reminds Me allot of Pillar's Where Do We From Here and Skillet's Collide CD's but without sounding like a total Rip Off of either this CD takes Disciple to the next Level and also it's on a new LabelA (SRE Recordings) both for the band and the public and with this Label suport and backing it take Disciple to a new Audience of Christian Music Fans
1,Pop Rap Wannabees,"This is the biggest dissapointment in hip hop history. Ice T and Kool Keith were supposed to be great together. But this Cd [stunk]. Don not waste your money. Listen to these wack lyrics, ""I'll sh*t on you n*ggas, cause I'm richer than you n*ggas."" And bunch of other [stuff] that makes no sense and is not good hip hop. I liked Dr. Octagon but this [stuff] was the worst Cd Kool Keith has ever made. PERIOD"
1,Choir Singer,"Judi Silvano sounds like she is a church singer on the rendition of ""A Flower Is A Lovesome Thing"". The voice has certainly developed an ""old person sound"". Listen to it very carefully. Not good on ballads."
4,About time,"I had the first two seasons. Now I have to get a gift box of six with two seasons I already had. At least the show finally came out completely on DVD. Several years ago TV Land use to show the entire 234 episodes in sequence. Then they started skipping over the greatest episode, In The Soup. Then they started moving the show all around, one night on at 7pm, the next night not there. Finally had enough and left that network 4 years ago. Too bad, it was great in the late 90's and early 20's. Enough of that. If you have the money, buy the set. It was one of the greatest shows of it's kind in the late 50's and early 60's. Then you can watch Beaver when YOU like and not be held hostage to some network's whims."
4,Leave It to Beaver - Yeah!,"I purchased a non-Amazon ""Beaver"" complete series two years ago that proved to be from China (charge an packaging), pirated off of television (TV Land), and was both poor image quality and often stopped before the end of the last scene. Read the Amazon reviews of this product and decided to try again. The video on this set is superb (given that the original recordings were done 50 years ago). But, the audio on our set is a bit disappointing; the volume is low and there are drop-outs and raspy noises occasionally. (Can't say if this is true of the product, or perhaps we just got a slightly defective set of DVDs.) Besides the only OK sound, we love the set."
2,...,"I know this film was very popular and I'm sure that many MJ die-hards loved it but, what about the rest of us?I'm not a huge MJ fan but, I dont necessarily believe that fandom is required in order to enjoy a concert movie like this. Sadly, this is one that I simply didn't enjoy despite enjoying much of MJ's music.The film seemed to drag at times and at many points I felt like watching it was more like a chore. And to be perfectly honest, I'm a little upset that I didn't enjoy it. It's a film I really wanted to like."
5,I saw it...I loved it...I will own it,"If anyone has ever questioned Michael Jackson's impact on the music business...please watch this movie.Genius...and with that level of creative genius, comes a level of madness.He was phenomenal..and when you watch him, you realize that he has been performingfor over 40 years...Fantastic tribute to a fantastic superstar.Rest in peace, dear Michael"
3,His legacy,"Well, Michael Jackson died too young. he was not only a good dancer but also an artist who understood how to entertain his audience. this movie is okay to watch but i like to see him the way he was before and rather watch his videos or tour shows on DVD/bluray. The documentary is lacking the real story."
5,THIS IS IT Ltd Ed 2 Disc Set,"I purchased ""This Is It"" the first day it was out...I really enjoyed watching the ""Special Features"" on the disc..We never got to see how Michael would end this concert...In special features they include what would have been the ending to the greatest concert that never was...When I saw this 2 disc Ltd. Ed. with one disc devoted to the dancers, the band, the singers, the aerialists and a bit more never seen footage, with two more songs, I had to watch it...It did not disappoint...If the 2 disc edition had been available at the store I would have purchased it but it was not ....The 2 disc set with bonus features was well worth the price...RIP MJ you are loved and missed"
5,Has not the product,"Good afternoon, though not in my hands the product I applied few days ago I sent an email and responding politely to wait until 15 March. It's what I'm doing now. What if I like it better track product at this time you handle orders through a company called Imex, I communicate with them in Colombia, and they said they do not manage your account in our country . Then stayed in the same situation without more information. Any news I would receive it, it is my first purchase through this medium. My phones are: the mobile is 3115542766, and the fixed numbers are 091 3403102 and 091 7723376. Bogota-Colombia.Thanks in advance."
5,"I have to say ""WOW""!","It was beyond anything that I expected to see. I was actually shocked and suprised that it was so good. So good, that it left me speechless. All I could say was, ""Wow""! when I walked out of the theatre. I couldn't imagine they would put something together so smoothly using clips from backstage scenes. Much of it appeared just as it would on stage in full costumes. Jackson appeared so frail and yet, he moved pretty good for a 50 year old guy who hadn't performed in quite a few years. He still seemed to have what it takes. The whole thing was quite a pleasant surprise to me. It was so good that I had to go back the next week and watch it all over again. The second time I saw it, I still said, ""Wow""! What more could one say? It was all very well done. Beautiful tribute to the man."
3,positivo,"the selected product is required, but definitely lacking in details such as a booklet to enjoy the maximum value of the object.as a whole is positive."
4,Nice Surprise,"I own a couple of M.J's early solo recordings, and of course who didn't love The Jackson 5. I was recommended this DVD and got to borrow it from the Library. I enjoyed it as I had never seen MJ in concert. He was a charismatic performer in the league of Mick Jagger and James Brown.I watched the DVD with the subtitles on because even though I knew MJ was a fantastic singer, I could never understand his lyrics. Oh My God they have got to be some of the worst lyrics I've ever heard! Not GENIUS material. He did allot of repeating a certain phrase over and over. ""Dance in the Round"" ""Annie Annie Annie"" . I never listened to him after he got way crazy with the plastic surgeries and other exploits. He was such a good looking guy. He really did not want to look like Papa Joe.Rest In Peace Michael, if you are really dead."
5,A Great Loss to Music and Dance,"I had forgotton some of my favorite MJ songs over the years and was suprised and saddened to think the end of this prodigy had come.Michael's dancing ability was wonderful. He was ready for the world to see again...and it is tragic this did not happen.No matter how eccentric he was, his musical and dancing genius will live on forever through ""This Is It"".See this video, or better yet, buy it. It is a Collector's item - no matter how sad the aftermath was. There will never be another Michael Jackson. He provided the soundtrack to my youth, as well as countless others."
5,"This Is It, A True Masterpiece from the Master Entertainer","In This Is It, you get a peak at what Michael Jackson, the Master Entertainer, had planned for concertgoers at his ill-fated This Is It tour. You get to see the genius at work, his perfectionism, enthusiasm, and kindness. I originally viewed this in the theater, and thought it fantastic, but even if you've seen it in the theater, get the DVD, the special features are amazing. With the special features you'll get to find out a few memories of Michael from those closest to him, including a story about him visiting a show and tell that I thought really expressed how much he truly cared about people, you'll also get to see some of the innovative, original costumes planned for what would have been the most spectacular concert tour anyone's ever seen, and you'll find out about MJ Air, one of the most clever ways for exiting a concert anyone could have ever thought of. Get the DVD now, you'll be happy you did!"
4,If you're a fan of MJ,"You should really see this. It shows how hard working he really was and of course, his creativity."
4,Olympus E-510,I am enjoying this camera and I like how the photos look. I would highly recommend it.
5,Great New SLR,"This package from Olympus is great! The kit lenses work very well and the overall quality is better than I expected. I am a nature photographer and the image stability built into the camera works great. I am able to take amazing photos without having to take my tripod everywhere. For the cost offered through Amazon, you can't get a better deal anywhere. Don't waste your time searching for a lower price."
4,its working,"i think it is working. we have tried everything.after my recent treatment i thought i do not have any lice.but order the comb anyway. Guess what, i find four newly hached lice.and also some nits."
5,LOVE IT,THIS IS WORTH THE MONEY... Used it for 3 days on my daighter and get got rid of it all. IT worth every penny spent.
5,"Fantastic for pets, too! [Pet rat]","One of my pet rats, adopted from a local shelter, had a small case of the L-word when we took him in. After learning from the vet that we could use kitten lice powder on him (once a week for three weeks), we started the treatment. We were also told to comb him to get the nits out. The plastic combs were not doing much, but this comb is amazing! Every time we hold him and comb him with it (going with the fur, not against), it pulls out lots of stuff: nits, dry skin, and a few loose hairs. And he sits still for it, so I think he actually likes it! His coat is in much better shape since using this comb to get rid of those nasty nits, and he is almost done his treatment. I used to see lice squirming on him, and I have not seen any in the last two weeks. It is totally worth what I spent on it from Amazon, and he is much happier. I highly recommend it for pets!"
2,Not ready for publication,"The hats are cute, but they needed someone to test them before publication. I knit a hat my sister picked and had to make many modifications to achieve a good result. A co-worker is on her third rework of another pattern because it isn't quite right and doesn't match the picture when the instructions are followed. The web site has a correction for a major mistake on a third pattern in the book, but doesn't deal with the items we found. OK, only two patterns were tried, but both had issues."
5,Companion piece,Perfect companion to the J. K. Rowling series. Look forward to my kids enjoying their very Potter Christmas this year.
4,Very interesting book,"If you are a Harry Potter fan, I highly recommend this book. It combines fantasy with history. I'm actually giving this book for gift, but I was intrigued and read a little bit of the book before wrapping it up. I would actually love to get of my own copy."
4,Another fun read while we wait for Book 6,"I've read a number of the ""accessory"" books inspired by Harry Potter, and this one is really good. It's a little like ""Magical Worlds of Harry Potter""(which I also recommend)in that it's set up by alphabetical entries you can easily reference without necessarily reading it in any particular order. It's very different in that ""Companion"" has subject by subject entries, referenced by which book/chapter/page it concerns (rather than questions based on the books as entries)and is a little more scholarly. If you love history, this book is probably the most detailed and informative (along with Buckbeak, who knew people charged all kinds of animals and even bugs with crimes)! You can learn arithmancy, tea leaf reading, palmistry, runes, and so on. This book is so complete, I don't think the authors missed anything connected with the books, regardless of how obscure. Give it a try-I actually rate it around a 4 1/2 stars."
4,Cute but too big !,I bought this hat for myself but when I got it it was too big for me. The size and the style of the hat so I returned it to the company and they exchanged it for me for another style hat. Which I like alot! They even paid for the shipping -great customer service !
1,The lenses are light amber -- not bright red as pictured,"The lenses are light amber -- not bright red as pictured. Otherwise, the glasses seem to be ok but the whole reason that I purchased them was so that they would be tinted red so they are useless to me."
2,"Not a manual, more like a recipe book","Very little in terms of tips for using food processor. Mostly recipes, most of which you could find anywhere. And most of the recipes were boring."
5,"Good recipes, tips and ideas","Good recipes and tips on how to use the food processor. The author provides recipes that teach you how to cook using this kitchen appliance. Once the recipes are followed, and the key ideas taught, you can apply the same methods for other similar recipes.I'd recommend this cookbook for the cook who is just learning how to use the food processor.Recommend."
3,Binding,"I've only had the book two days and the binding is coming apart. If I decide to keep it, I'll have to drill three holes through the book and keep it in a three ring binder. Not what I want to do however.The recipes do look interesting, but please do something with the binding."
5,Admirable film!,"Once more the genius of Erich von Stroheim can be appreciated in this superb and mature film. The astonishing handle of the camera and the facial expressions have in him an eloquent and perfect ambassador. Sobriety, charm and exquisite good taste are the real difference."
4,Good master of ancient material,"Very interesting story of deception among the jet set before there was one.Eric von Stroheim plays a real Count who dishonors his home and visiting country by enlisting two fake cousins in his schemes to extract wealth from Monte Carlo vacationers. When he's not pursuing rich married women, he's ""borrowing"" from the Housekeeper he has promised to marry.One of the ""cousins"" is Mae Busch in an early role. Known better as ""Mrs. Hardy"" or L & H's nemesis in many Laurel and Hardy films, it's fun to watch her strut her stuff: the character is similiar to the one from ""Chickens Come Home"", from about 10 years later.Great sets, costumes; interesting camera angles; tintype effect. New musical soundtrack is a solo piano, beautifully incorporated.Viewer should know that the film conatins some very disturbing racialcontent, of course, typical of the period."
1,This sorry s**t,"Young Jeezy has to be the worst rapper out the A. I am extremely disappointed in the latest trend of Southern music. Its all about the beat and chorus with complete disregard for lyrics. Young Jeezy is the leader of this downward spiral. I wouldnt buy the real album or the bootleg and if someone gave it to me free, i'd give it to a crackhead. His flow is like water behind a dam.He's garbage!!!!!"
4,listen faggot,maybe this just me but im sure alot of niggaz would agree it sound like you just gotta problem wit gucci dick bein in ya mouth jeezy a real nigga an real recognize real ya fake ass bitch this album hot just like lets get it cop em both
3,Worth Checking Out,"The album is a double album with the CD's titled ""Hard"" and ""Soft"". Hard was meant to consist of hardcore rap songs and Soft consists of more ""radio-friendly"" tracks.In short, ""Hard"" is a classic. The whole CD goes all the way through. ""Soft"" has to be one of the worst albums I ever heard. I understand the concept and the innuendo of cocaine in the titles of the CD's and the name of the album, however, where Jeezy succeeded with Hard, he fails with Soft"
2,This wasn't Thug motivation jeezy,"This album wasn't in Jeezy's leaugue there was no ad lives, no punchlines, it was pretty much trash. He sounded like Trick Daddy, about to cry, on his best song, On The Whip pt.2. pt1 was another okay song but i give it 4stars on the best song. Overall this was a 1 oe 2 star album. I'm glad jeezy picked up the pace with Lets get it, Trap or Die, The sreets iz watchin, and Cant ban the snowman go pick them up instead of this trash."
3,It's OK but........,I purchased the Sony Compact and Slim Travel Speaker to use with my MP3 player when I want to listen to my music or the radio but didnt want to be tied up with ear phones. I used it while painting. It is easy to use and very portable. I love the way it folds up. It feels quite study too. But the one thing that really disappointed me was the sound quality. I would have expected better from Sony but I guess you get what you pay for. Had I wanted to spend more I am sure I would have found travel speakers with much better sound quality. I didnt want to spend more because my main use will be when doing painting and any messy job that if I should spill something on the speakers I wont be out alot of money if it gets damaged. So all in all I would say that if you want a cheap travel speaker this one will do but if you want something with better sound quality then you need to keep shopping.
5,Great speakers for my MP3,These speakers worked very well for the price. I am very happy with my purchase. The loudness of the music or audio book that I play depends on how loud the original is. If I have a song on my MP3 player that has a good sound value to which it will play just fine with these speakers. It's very convenient to take with me -- it fits in my purse or pocket easily. It is extremely convenient. It's not as loud as a boombox but for a small speaker that you can take anywhere it's great. I've been using it for about two months.
5,Great book..,This book mentioned things that I had not even thought about. Great tips and ideas to share. This is a good book for anyone that is a beginner or seasoned artist.
2,"A Pamphlet, not a Book","I dawdled over breakfast and finished this by the third cup of coffee.I could comment on the author's predictions, but in truth they are quite unremarkable. This book simply lists ""this happened, then this other thing happened."" No plot, no characters, no descriptions of battles that never were. The Eastern Front is dealt with in less than a hundred words. The Holocaust gets even fewer.I have no real complaint, save value-for-money. If you need something to read over breakfast you might like this."
1,Pretty gutsy,"Pretty gutsy to sell an unimaginative 48 page pamphlet at a price exceeding that of 360+ pages AH novels like S.P. Breit's ""Wolf Hunt (The Burning Ages)"" or William Peter Grasso's ""East Wind Returns"". If you want to get something for your money, buy those.Go check out any AH forum online; you'll get timelines more extensive and plausible than this one there for free."
1,Don't waste your money,If I could give zero (0) stars I would. I finished this in about an hour. The plot was thin to non-existent. No characters. Just an alternative timeline with very little to no background support. Save you money and spend it on a better alternate history book.
4,Quite simple but useful,"I was really impressed when i got this book, it was too little. However, when i started to read it I was impressed by all the useful information that it has. I know it will help me to improve my delegation's performance in the upcoming NMUN conference. I strongly recomend this book. It worths its price."
2,Manual horrible,Who wrote a manual for this thing. It's impossible to comprehend. At the end you'll figure out how to use this timing device on your own. But manual should have been written by more intelligent people.
4,Good price. As described. Slow shipping.,"Works great, exactly as described. Good Price. It arrived without product packaging, just in a box, exposed. The shipping was fairly slow."
1,Toning The Sweep,"Toning the Sweep in my opinion is very boring. It has no climax to keep you on the edge of your seat. Some of the chapters don't make sense, nad they don't flow into each other smoothly. The Characters were structured pretty well, but it was hard to understand them till the last few chapters. I couldn't understand the way they were feeling, and sometimes I couldn't understand why they were feeling that way. The book also has no dramatic points in it, the plot was very weak. Some positive things about the book are that it is an easy book to read. The grammer usage is appropriate for the book. Sometimes you have to reread parts of the book to understand it. Over all the book is an easy read and I recommend it for older people who have probably lived through the civil rights movement."
3,Review on Toning The Sweep,"The novel Toning The Sweep by Angela Johnson is a story about a fourteen-year-old girl named Emily. She just found out that her grandmother, Ola is dying of cancer and will be moving back to Cleveland with them so they can take care of her. When they drive down to Little Rock Emily remembers how much she loves the Desert, and her Mother remembers how much she hates it. They collect all of her grandmother's things and Emily decides to video tape Ola (her grandmother) and her friends for memories to take home with them. While Emily is down there she finds out what really happened to her grandfather and how he died. She then understands why her grandmother is so upset about it. I would reccomend this book to anyone who beleives family should stick together through rough times and love one another unconditionally."
3,Sympathy for the people,"This is a very strange album , it's actually not really an LP , it's kinda like the extra from Portrait Of An American Family . Smells like children is awsome to listen to in the dark , and the Dope Hat remixes are good . The Album is a big joke , and it's hilarious . F*** Frankie is hilarious . To give you the best tracks from my opinion are. Diary Of A Dope Fiend , Kiddie Grinder , Sweet Dreams , Rock'n'Roll N*****. Hope this helped you ."
5,Manson's best c-d,"some people say that smells like children is a washout for a manson c-d. They're wrong. I bought smells like children a year ago and i still can't stop listening to it. if you're going to buy one manson c-d let this one be it.to get the full efect of ""Smells like children"" listen to track 3 on halloween."
2,My least favorite work from Manson.,"This is my least favorite work from Mr. Manson to date, because its made up of filler tracks, Skits, and a few cover songs. If this would have been the first manson CD I ever listend to. I would not be a fan.What earns this disk its star is Mr. Manson's the very good cover of Sweet Dreams. If your new to manson I would suggest you get ""The Sweet Dreams"" single or the ""The Last Tour on Earth""(Live)CD. Which has his best songs(before the ""Holy Wood"" LP came out)including ""Sweet Dreams""."
3,pretty good,"This one is an okay cd, but definetely mansons least good cd so far. It is mostly a remix album, but personally, i am not much into those type of cds. However, it does have ""Sweet Dreams"", which is by far the best track, the other good one is ""Rock 'n Roll Nigger"". If you like manson, you should get this one, because it does have one of his most famous songs on it, but don't expect much more great stuff other than those 2 tracks."
3,Smells like... an ok album...,"while this certainly isn't Manson's best, its still quite decent. any Manson fan will at least like this album, but people new to his music may not be that amazed.also, i had quite an amusing time reading the ""kid's reviews"" that were obviously posted just to lower the album's rating. oh man you guys are good, you really hit Manson were it hurts! the amazon review section! ouch. go back to your church you closed minded bigots."
4,2008 Honda Civic SI - Happy Customer,"Q: Is this going to make your car faster?A: Not noticeably.Q: Increase your gas mileage?A: A bit, yes.Q: Save you money?A: In the long run, yes since you can reuse this.Q: Sound better?A: I didn't notice any change.Feel free to ask me anymore questions in comments and I'll answer the best I can."
2,Not one of Mrs. McNaught's best,"I know alot of people may disagree with me, but I was quite disappointed with Mrs. McNaught's Almost Heaven. I found the story be a bit unbelievable, the characters somewhat uniform, and the whole love plot to be stagnet. I didn't enjoy the approach Judith took with her previous characters: The Duke and Duchess of Hawthrone were former shadows of their orginal personalities. I also found her new heroine and hero to be shallow and undescript. There really was no depth with their relationship. I must convey that it was indeed sad for me to write this review since Judith McNaught has always been one my favorite writers."
3,Three stars ...... all for Ian Thornton,"I'm not going to rehash the story; others have already done that. The first half of this novel was top notch. It was a fresh idea, delivered expertly and Ian's character was enticing. It was a pleasure to read about a man falling in love with a woman and he was not afraid to admit it.The biggest downfall of the book was Elizabeth's characater. McNaught boasted of her brians, but the reader didn't see any of that. It baffled me how she could be couragous one minute and a complete ninny the next. If she hadn't been so naive and childish, things might have worked out for her and Ian right off the bat. Elizabeth didin't have a speck of common sense and when Ian first stated he thought they were falling in love I thought it was a joke.The book didn't keep me wondering about anything. I only kept reading because Ian was a captivating hero."
2,Will it ever end???,"This book just seems to go on and on forever. Ive read other books by this author and had no problem with them but this one just dragged on and on. The heroine was a unappealing teenager who was too naive and too innocent and whose only redeeming quality was that she could shoot well, could tend a garden and could turn heads (male of course). The hero wasn't well developed and came across as bland. There wasn't much chemistry between the two and, aside from their physical passion, they had very few qualities between them to make a solid relationship.I'm not quite sure why I finished the book. I guess I hate not reading to the end. But it took me a while. Definitely not like others that I inhale in a day! Definitely not her best!"
2,Not quite up to par,"We ordered this footrest along with the Brummi Kettrike. The quality of the cycle is fantastic and we expected the same from the footrest. However, the footrest does not stay in place which causes the wheels to ""lock up"" while we are pushing, which lurches the bike and my child forward. I e-mailed the folks at Kettler and they had no real suggestions as to how to resolve the problem. Unless this item works better on different Kettrikes, I would not spend the money for this item."
2,Need better descriptions.,"I gave this product two stars because I never actually got to use it, but love the concept. The footrest only works with certain Kettler bikes that have the free wheel system, which the bike I ordered doesn't have. It would have been useful if that was mentioned in the description of the product as I wouldn't have had to go through the return process. Am very happy with all of Amazon's sevices."
3,good but others better,This book is a good read but not as good as the other books by Dorthea .Has a lot of jumping around and repetitive story lines but still not a bad book/
3,the Land of Mango Sunsets,"While i was excited about buying a Dorethea Bento Frank book for only $5.00, I was disapointed by the description of the book as ""like new"" without jacket. The book itself is badly stained on the back cover, and some pages also have stains on them. The book also smells ""musty"" as if it had been left in a damp place for too long and not aired out properly. Next time I will spend the extra few dollars and buy a never used product."
4,Captures the Essence,"A great coffee table book for anyone interested in the AT. While it does not capture the ""backwoods"" arena of long distance hiking, this book does bring to life the camaraderie and closeness of the appalachian community."
4,Cool game,"We have played this game a few times so far with other couples and had fun every time - we are total 80's enthusiasts. This game has a lot of cool questions and we have not had any repeats yet. The questions are challenging, but fair. A few of my favorite 80's nuggets are - a young Alfonse Ribeiro appears in a Pepsi commercial with Michael Jackson (1984)...Kellogg's first makes C3PO's breakfast cereal (1983)...Newcleus hits Billboard chart with the song ""Jam On It""...Activision releases Pitfall for Atari (1982)...""Baby Jessica"" is resuced from the well in Texas (1987 - and then the news footage appears in Michael Jackson's ""Man in the Mirror"" video!) Anyway, it's a good game."
2,Disappointing,The questions in the game are too easy and the game play is not very interesting. I think this game would be a good value for [money] but not at almost [money].
4,if you liked the B @ T's song...,"I noticed a lot of folks liked ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", then some either liked the rest of it and some didn't. If you like that song (and it is kinda catchy), you are highly likely to like Pop Art, a band I really enjoyed in the mid-late eighties. There is a retrospective CD available, so it's not like you have to go a-hunting for old vinyl. When B@T came out, it was killing me how much it sounded like a Pop Art song. Thought I'd share that obscure gem with anyone who might be reading these reviews!"
2,Not really the Byrds,"Short and sweet, this album just never worked for my ears. I fell in love with The Byrds with the first album and hung with them through the changes in line-up and styles (yeah, I even liked Byrdmaniax) but this one just fell flat. Only a couple oftunes even sound Byrd-like and the rest just sort of lay there and make you wonder what was going on in the groups head when they listened to the playbacks. If you're a Byrd fan then thiseffort will more than likely disappoint you in a big way. If youare just getting into the group, this album will make you wonderwhat all the hub-bub was about. Trust me: They were so muchbetter than this effort shows. Stick to the earlier stuff or thegreatest hits/best of/ esstiential packages."
1,Don't buy this for children.,"I am so sorry I wasted my money on this DVD. I was hoping my kids could get some exercise and have fun learning the dance moves. They never teach the moves. They are just dancing in front of you calling out steps. The quality is poor, too. The camera will focus in on a move and then jump frames into a totally unrelated dance and then back again. It was just horrible. What a disappointment."
5,An active and fun 60-minute DVD introduction to the wonderful hobby of hip-hop dancing for children,"Also available in a VHS format ($19.95), Hip Hop For Kids: Pop! Lock! And Break! from Jumping Fish Productions is an active and fun 60-minute DVD introduction to the wonderful hobby of hip-hop dancing for children. Teaching its viewers of the different techniques and progression of break dancing. Enhanced with a ""Special Performance"" by professional breakers Roger G, GG, Poker and Ms. Twist; and ""Audition Combo"" showing the dances performed at the audition for this outstanding DVD; ""In Rehearsal"" providing a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the DVD; ""Pop Challenge"" showcasing an advanced popping combination; and ""Nutrition"" for some get-smart tips for eating right; and a CD Soundrack for dance party fun; and the dance soundtrack and the dance song ""The Harlem Shake"", Hip Hop For Kids is very highly recommended for young viewers ages 7 to 16 who are searching for a new hobby or fun activity."
5,Splendid Work,"Richard Irving Dodge was the epitome of the American gentleman upon the voyage of the Great Plains which he so deeply loved for it's liberty and infinite hunting.The Colonel was well respected by both his superiors and the locals who he dealt with.In this book, he reveals wonderful insights to both the culture, brutality and dealings with the plains Indians through fact, interaction and experience.The Indian is dealt with as he should be with truthfulness.While due to the higher standards of the day, the more graphic details of what Indians did in torturing captives is refered to as ""outrages"". Dodge does credit in his honesty."
1,Horrible,"If you are buying this chair thinking that your kid can actually sit in it, then don't. This chair is for a doll. Although on the website it looks like a normal size chair for a kid to sit in, when it arrives, you will quickly find out that this is a chair for a baby doll. Make sure that you are buying a baby doll chair when you purchase this item. Again this is not a chair for your child to sit in. It is for their baby dolls."
1,very upset,I ordered this chair for my 5 year old daughters room. When I recieved the chair I was shocked that it was actually for a doll. Now I have to return it. Who in thier right mind would pay 12.oo for a little chair.
1,Not what I thought..very misconceiving,"I thought I was buying a chair for my 5 yr. old neice..It is only a chair that would fit a barbie size doll. Next time I will look further into the measurements, however I am very upset at the deceiving picture and ad."
2,100 Words or Less,"During the first part of this novel, I realized just how much science Asimov was cramming into his science-fiction. The characters and plot took the time to detail the scientific basis of their world. That doesn't happen much anymore, and I was really intrigued.Then I hit the 2nd part. The novel suddenly becomes bogged down in alien social networking and a seemingly endless string of dialogues about conforming to expectations. This new mode went on and on and on.I finally had to stop reading."
5,One of the few Good Doctor's novels not tied with Foundation,"or Robot universes. I beleive this also the only novel, where Isaac Asimov introduces alien intelegence. There are alien creatures living in the sun and suriving by eating sun's energy. In the meanwhile, humans discover new source of energy. However, this new energy station will present mortal danger to sun and human species. So, an alien and the human realize the truth and they try to talk sence to their civilizations."
1,Cock-A-Doodle-Don't.,"I know this is an American site, and so you may not have heard of these saps from the UK before. Hopefully you never will, but I thought I'd give you fair warning to switch over if ever you see/hear their bland, poor man's Bon Jovi attempts at rock music for 12 year old girls.You can see the marketing men having a field day with these guys. ""Hmm.. music's nice and unoffensive, could be played on radio.. lead singer looks like someone from Smallville or something, that face could be a poster on any kids wall... SOLD!""Don't be fooled. The first single, ""Come Get Some"" (ugh) is a loathsome attempt at being ""edgy"", a dire ""hey, we RAWK"" abomonation that surely didn't fool anyone. And then, batten down the hatches, 'cos heeere come the ballads. It really is awful stuff. Crap name, crap songs, crap band - but no doubt heading to an MTV near YOU.Don't say I didn't warn you.(...)"
5,Excellent product,"It is very important to go to Mars. So far we have had unmanned missions. Perhaps in the future we will go to this fantastic world and we settle it. I am an invalid. On Mars there is a less gravity, and perhaps we can live better there."
5,Look Great in our New Home!,My husband purchased these doorknobs after we bought a home that had a bunch of mixed-match knobs. These knobs were easy to install and look fabulous! We would definitely purchase again!
1,untruthful claims,It has been customary for some lobbies to support publishing books full of non-sense and non-objective approaches to historical events .There is NO document in the British Archives about the claimed genocide and if you take into account the fact that they had searched all of Ottoman Archives without success for indications of an organized campaign against the Armenian people of which more than 1 million still live in Turkey this can give you an idea about the reputability of this book.Read books by Bernard Lewis or the number of other Western history researches whose money comes from the books that they write.
4,Yiddish folklore --- Tales of Chassidism,"Singer's father was a Hasid rabbi, and these stores are Jewish, but concern all mankind. These are stories with rich smells, and I can almost smell the chalah bread, and taste the kreplach and macaroons. Set in shtetl, (small communities of Eastern European Jews), there is a conflict of traditional culture and modern Jewish practice.Not only are there stories of golem, dybbuks, and demons, but even more earthy people as Dr. Fischelson who marries a woman known as Black Dobbe. There is a devil manipulating two perpetual liars, the flamboyant Glicka Genedel, and Reb Yomtom. There is a story of divine providence, where a beggar directs and aspiring chimney sweep, then down the road is paid back. These stories are sure to delight and surprise."

5,Great book.,Probably the best wartime flying book I have ever read. The descriptions of the A6 flying is very realistic. Highly recommended book.
1,Worse fans in the baseball,"Rude, arrogant, and slobs. All this BEFORE they won anything. It only took them a century to do it.Baseball isn't what it use to be. Now its all about hired guns, watered down baseball, wild card, no teamallegence. Baseball had its glory days from the 20's to the 60's."
5,LOVE THE PRODUCT AND THE SELLER,"THE PRODUCT IS GREAT!!! YOU WILL FEEL REALLY CONFORTABLE WITH THIS CREAM, IT MAKE YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL AND HELPS PREVENT WRINKLES."
5,One of my favorites from the Lancer/Ace Series.,"Three Howard stories, two of them more novellas than shorts. And Red Nails and Beyond the Black River are two of the best Conan tales of all time. Conan is in his mid thirties, his physical prime. Red Nails takes place in large covered city in the Black Kingdoms where the remnants of the race war among themselves in thier madness. Beyond the Black River is the tale of Conan on the Pictish frontier of Aquilonia, where his barbarism saves civilization from the depredations of another barbarian tribe, the Picts. Among the greatest sword and sorcery tales of all time."
5,*~*greatest game ever*~*,"This game has the best graphics i have ever seen.The trees sway back and forward and the water is very clear and you can see every thing underwater.There are lots more soldiers hat can be made unlike Age of Empires where there are only about 20 soldiers you could choose from,but in this game there is constantly new upgrades to your soldiers and buildings and units.I have the demo and the game looks G*R*E*A*T.I know I am getting it are you..."
3,Not what i expected,"If you are looking for age of empires 1 or 2, or even command and conquer type of games, this one isnt up your alley. Its styled similiar to myth 2, but the play is built more like an RPG type of game, i was disappointed after allthe hype, maybe you wont be, but C&C and AOE it sure isnt."
2,Too Difficult to Be Enjoyable,"Perhaps I'm just not enough of ""hard core"" gamer, but I foudn this game too difficult to be enjoyable. While I enjoyed building and advancing my civilization, there's just no way to avoid doing battle and play a simply economic game. So, about the time I get a wonder built or a couple started the AI kicks in and stomps the bejeezus out of me. I've had the game for a year - even bought the strategy guide - and I've yet to play complete a scenario succesfully, and this is while playing on the easiest setting. Perhaps I'm more used to simulation/city-building games than RTS games, but it seems to me that for the game to be enjoyable the average use ought to have at least a reasonable chance at success.Technically, graphically, it's a great game. No complaints there, but the level of difficulty makes me unlikely to want to continue playing."
2,Horrible tech support,"I can't comment on the quality of the game because I was never able to run it. I have a very common configuration (Dell PII-450mhz with 128 velocity video adapter)running XP. This game is not compatible with this system. I have been attempting to contact their technical support for weeks but have received no response. I only recently learned that my particular video adapter (very common) is not compatible with this game in XP. It is amazing that they would have not worked this out prior to release. If you buy this game, I hope you don't have any technical problems because you will not receive adequate technical support."
1,Don't buy,"I was not pleased. I ordered software that I could not load. After going on the companies web site, I learned that this game was full of problems. I was very concerned that it would cause a hard drive crash after seeing the warning signs.Before you even think of buying, go to the Sierra Studios web site to learn about all the hoops you may have to jump through before you can even begin to play."
1,sucky,"this product was the worst and shouldn't be purchased if you don't want to throw 20 dollars down the drain. HORRIBLY DONE. sierra should have been disposed of and a better company like the creators of Medeival total war should make another game. SO THINK AGAIN IF YOU PLAN TO BUY IT. it is boring and nothing is realistic especially the graphics, for example the people are larger than the house. so don't buy this...............for your own sake!"
5,the options,"For those who like games such as Age of Empires and Age of Empires Two, then this game is just for you. Finding as much facts on EE as i could, and i found recordings of Rick Goodman (Lead Designer of Age of Empires)talking about the options on this game, such as certains attributes you can give ur troops, like armor, or damage, the 12 epochs you can go through, or where ever u wanna start, also in the map editor, movies can be created for your games, becuase of the 3-d environmt. which brings me to this next one about u veiw points wheather u want it far away like on age, or right down in the chaos. But one of the most exciting feature is the custom civilization option, with over 100 attributs to it u can customize and build your civilization the way you want it. now that ive covered this, ill close out to say the EE is the rts of 2001-2002. Which is why i give it 5 stars."
1,This game really sucks,This is the worst game ... I got it because of all the cool units and graphics. I even went online looked at reviews online and alla were great. So I bought it I made a scenario for it. At first I just thought it was slow just because I put too many units on the game. Wrong I started a regular game but the same thing happened. Also it take about 10 minutes for the game to save. Also I am not lying when I say this I told one of my cybers to attack an enemy unit but it took 5 minutes for it to respond. For those of you who want a game similiar to empire earth I'd go with Total Annihilation. It's an old one for Windows 95 but I personally think that it's better. It's even got more defence units such as torpedo launchers and missle turrets which Empire Earth doesn't have. So for those of you who want to buy Empire Earth think again.
1,Here we go again,"Oh brother, not another AoE, C&C, StarCraft clone. In fact, it sounds like they just took all of those games and put them into one long one. Hey guys, Wake up! These RTS games are all exactly the same! How many times can you gather the same three or four resources, upgrade your units and fight repetitive battles over and over before you realize that its not really a ""strategy"" game anymore? Have some originality and try a real historical simulation strategy game like Europa Universalis."
4,Inumerous hours of fun,"Empire Earth is an amazing real time strategy game. Since I bought it in December 2001, I have indulged in it. Its great because you can choose a civilisation and then play accross all or selected historical time periods and there are many opportunties to tailor your gameplay according to your own needs. The 3-D graphics though not fabulous are still nice/ detailed and you can control simultaneously many airborne/ seaborne and land units (which in AOE was not posssible, hence large groups of armies or ships etc). All in all you will get addicted to empire creation and conquest and soon forget about other Real time strategy games, once you start playing EE."
2,Whoa Big Bugs,"Well the game play would make for a great RTS game, 'cept the damm thing crashes to desktop, or even worse does a complete crash (yeah restarts the machine!) on a regular basis. Ran through all the learning game fine, but it doesn't seem to like random games...UGH! No new patches since Nov of 2001 so don't hold your breath for more fixes....My machine is a Dell Demension PIV which is less that a year old running W2k!Good luck and pass on this poorly tested and supported product.OH I forgot to mention it uses secureROM a terrible security product that forced me to update my mother board drivers before the damm game would work!"
2,Not worth the 2 cent disk it's on,"This game promised a lot, but failed miserably. It has ok graphics, but the gameplay is slow and on some computers there's a time delay. If you like ages of empires then you'll like this, but otherwise spend your money on Civ 3 or Europa Universalis."
2,Scattered,"As much as I'd like to admire the people from Inside Kung-fu magazine for trying to cover a lot of ground in this book, none of it is very cohesive and what it does cover, it mostly skims over. Articles are rarely more than three or four pages and nothing is gone into in-depth.I also take an issue with putting Chapter 18 in the book, which deals with auras, prana, and other scientifically unsound ideas that have become a large source of ridicule to kung fu.So this book is not a guide for the ""Ultimate Training for the Martial Arts"" but rather a series of semi-related articles."
1,Very disappointing,"I was disappointed with this story. I had never read anything by this author. So, after reading great reviews on this book I decided to give it a try. I felt as though the writer didn't take the time really create chemistry between the characters and I think the story was a little rushed. I didnt fall in love with the characters. In my opinion this story fell short of emotion. If you want something with a similar story line read ""Dont die my love"" by Lurlene Mcdaniel it is a great read."
5,Marvelous,"It might be a marvelous book for both buddhists and everyone else who wants to gain insights into the true nature of life and live on happily. The author cares more about wisdom and the wise view on life than buddhism the form of religion. The narrative is fluent and humourous, the stories enticing and inspiring."
2,Who is the target audience?,"This book is, at times, informative but at other times it feels like an author's irritated rant. The tone is of impatience and ridicule for our human tendencies. It is unclear who the targeted audience is; some few times the author speaks clearly and informatively about Buddhist fundamentals, other times he speeds through the details and speaks as if it should be elementary to the reader, so why cover it. I took a break to read ""Siddhartha"" by Hesse, it made it more bearable when I decided to return this reading. But I am still struggling to complete it, not enjoyable."
4,"Love everything, but the strap","I'm a Sous-chef at one restaurant and a line chef at another so getting my knives back and forth is a big reason why I needed a knife roll. I loved that this product was cheap, had plenty of space in it. the only thing I don't like about it is the design for the strap. when I carry it one side of the strap always tries to fall off. that being said it's an easy fix. just find a large knife or honing rod the length of the knife roll on either ends of the roll to keep the strap in line."
4,"Average bag, awkward strap","Almost exactly as pictured except inner pocket that folds over knives zips shut, doesn't use velcro as in photo.Also, catty-corner strap hooks are counter-intuitive. The closure velcro (that holds each side to the other when rolled) un-sticks and allows half of the roll to flip open when picked up by shoulder strap without handle velcro secured, had to remove the acrylic strap & d-ring and re-position to keep the bag from whipping open when picked up.Other than that, decent for the cost. Obviously doesn't hold things much thicker than a couple knife handles as it doesn't have solid panels, doesn't have bells & whistles, comes as pictured. Two or four of the knife pouches are a bit wider (the ones toward the outside) in case you have Santokus or small cleavers you'd rather keep (guarded)blade-in. I use them for my Wüsthof shears and Microplane."
5,Great,my husband makes handknives and uses this to carry them to his retailers. It is very strong and durable and he is very satisfied with the product.
4,good bag,It's a good bag but I would like it if the individual sleeves were a lot longer. The heel of end of most of the blades are exposed out of the pockets and I just don't like that. I could not find a bag for a reasonable price that did this. Solution was to buy the sheeths but the point of the bag in the first place I thought was to not have to have those. I guess they are double protected now.
2,What the ....????,I found this book an indulgent male fantasy and was disturbed by the graphic language and lurid images Thomas created. I do not understand the need to shock a reader by using the most hideous language you can find. I would have been more interested in this book if it had not started so badly. I found the case study more interesting to laugh at the Freudian interpretation. And to not have to skip over the cursing! I didn't even want this book in my house after I had finished reading it in case someone ever picked it up to have a look!
1,A Hoax,"The White Hotel is a great book. Unfortunately, after its release, researchers found that D.M. Thomas lifted passages from the work of other writers. His career never recovered. Can we forgive this if the book is still superb? As a writer, I emphatically say no. Plagerism is the great sin of writers. The idea that there is no such thing as plagerism, a notion put forth by the now dated ""theorists,"" must be dismissed. If you make use of another writer's work, you must give that writer credit. Otherwise, don't use it.Richard Cummings"
5,It's a great OEM replacement.,Great fit and firm ride. You only get one though. Unlike the shocks that came as a pair. I had to buy two of the struts. GR-2 the 2 is not for 2 of them.1993 Mustang LX 2.3 owner
1,rip off,this was nothing but a repeat of the last episode of season 4. i saw that for free on netflix but was hoping this would be something more since she was broken out in one day. apparently not. i searched for season 5 and this popped up and before looking at the details i purchased it. my fault for not looking at the details but still a rip off. $15 for an episode that i already saw on netflix for free.
3,high priced backpack,The toy is very fun to little girls. However itis extremely overpriced. It's nothing more than a back pack with many pockets for doll clothes and pretty colors girls will like. I wouldn't pay no more than $20 for another one. My little girl does love it though.
4,Very Informative Book!,"I had the pleasure of studying the Transitional Economies of the former USSR under Dr. Marangos at Colorado State University. The class was great, and the book was a fantastic tool in learning the subject. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is Marangos requiring his own book at this inflated price!All kidding aside, this book is one of the better Econ texts out there, so if you're in school and thinking about taking a class about Transition Economies and the different models used I would easily recommend a course using this easy to follow and understand book."
3,Alright,"Bought this game at a thrift shop for a buck and I found out it was worth it!!! Although an ancient game from Microsoft, I like it. As soon as you play it you'll mumble,""Bad graphics"", and it does....There are 7 missions to play, and it took a heck of my time to beat the first one. At least this is one of those games that actually have a bit of challenge in them.I tried this game out with a joystick, and the game went whacky...keyboard controllers are also easy and fun to use."
3,game was great,till they put out the new patch. now there isn't enough good weapons and the difficulty level in nightmare and hell are just way too hard to play.
2,"No Blizz, don't send us to Hell again.","Diablo 2 was bad enough. Mindless point-and-clicking in a dull and repetive environment -- that was essentially all D2 was.Then Blizzard decided to cash-in on zombified Diablo 2 players by releasing this. Sure, it adds a new act and 2 new classes. But how long is that going to keep you entertained? Once you beat act 5 a few times, it becomes boring.The bottom line is: the only thing that keeps you playing this like a zombie is the items. That's it. Nothing more. For me, I find seeking unique items that very boring. I know many D2 zombies, er, I mean D2 players will find this good entertainment.So unless you get a kick out of mindlessly searching for items, then Lord of Destruction is not going to keep you entertained very long. I bought this in anticipation that it will add a new dimension to D2 -- looks like I was wrong. It's still the SAME GAME."
5,diablo 2 lord of disrtuction,im a long player for diablo 2 and it's a game that i would like to play a longer time.
4,Kickin' Butt - D2 Style!,"A rocking expansion pack...much better than Hellfire was for the original Diablo game. The game does occasionally kick out some uniques and rares, but this stuff is a lot harder to come by than in the original D2. I like the addition of the runes (which can be combined to make extra strong weapons and armor) and the fact there are more gems. I plugged a Thul rune into one of my unique bows, and the thing is hot! Act 5 is a lot of fun, as well as being challenging and visually attractive. The fact that the mercenaries you hire can be outfitted with armor, weapons, and headgear, and also level with you is a big improvement. Remember how useless the Act 1 and 2 hires were in the original? Much better! Brava!"
2,PROBLEMS WITH XP,"Like many here, I had a great time playing d2. Perhaps like not so many here, I had a miserable time getting LOD to run. The box says that the game is playable in XP, but I cannot get the characters to run smoothly, and it's not the hardware (1ghz Ath.; geForce2 GTS; 256K RAM). D2 seems to run fine in XP, but both the cinematics and the game for LOD don't work. Blizzard's technical support on this issue is underwhelming. For the five seconds that the game worked before it froze, though, it looked like it might have had some potential."
2,"I love NIN, but this is trash!!!!","I *love* NIN, so don't get me wrong, but this album is a terrible bunch of remixes of Trent Reznor's music by people who are not Reznor. There is maybe one track that he actually worked on. Overall, this is mostly a remix album of some of the weaker songs on ""The Downward Spiral"". I mean, it does have a remix of ""hurt"" and ""tds"", but honestly, does anbody consider ""piggy"" and ""mr. self destruct"" to be at the level of ""closer,"" ""march of the pigs,"" and ""heresy""? A sorry attempt to cash in on a great alum, and I can't believe Reznor allowed his name to be put on this."
5,Reznor at his best,"This is simply (in my view) Reznor's best work, all the tracks take on completely different feel from their original counterparts. This does take a large Nails fan to appreciate though."
2,Dismal,"The thing I like the most about NIN is their raw anger and crashing about. No anger on this one. This CD is like a last gasp...a death rattle. This one brought me down, down, down...maybe it was intended to do that....the only song I really liked on it was ""Hurt"" which is darker (if that's possible) than the version on ""The Downward Spiral"". Listen to this one and you may have to watch a Barney video to cheer up."
2,A lukewarm batch of remixes; a real disappointment!,"Well, ""Piggy"" and ""Hurt"" were excellent tracks with good guitar work and a great beat. The rest were nothing to get excited about. Maybe it's too much to expect the same level of artistic attainment that Trent Reznor reached in ""Pretty Hate Maching"" and ""Down the Spiral."" Most of the tracks in this effort do nothing for industrial music. ""Further Down the Spiral"" is for grannies! Maybe it should be released under the name ""Three Inch Rubber Weenies""!"
5,Brutally Awesome!,"For those who havn't heard a lot of Alice, keep in mind; you never know what you are going to get. I saw this album and immediatly bought it (where was the promotions dept?). WOW! At 50 something Aice has just released a monster of an album. From the first notes of the title track Alice's aural assault is impressive. Lyrically this has to be one of his best and his vocals are perfectly suited to the music. A dark angry observation of the world around him he hits on topics such as racism, abuse, greed, pessimism and sanctuary often from a first person point of view with conviction. The closest comparison would be Raise Your Fist (another classic) but so much deeper and sinister. ""THIS IS NOT SCHOOL'S OUT"" OR ""WELCOME"" it is a metal (or is now called ""extreme music""?) masterpiece and not for the feint of heart or mind. Crank it!"
4,Big Fans Only,For the 2 remixes on this sigle many say its a rip off however the Mother Inferios Got Her Gunn is an wonderful remix of Get your Gunn and relevlation #9 is probably the weirdest MM song ever. (12 min long and half of it backwards)
5,One of the best books in Magic,"This is one of the finest books in magic with cards. As an expert magician and cardician I highly recomend this book to beginners and professionals of the ""Quin Art"""
5,For Spanish Speaking Chess players,This is the same Learn to Play Chess with Fritz and Chesster that Viva Media publishes in the United States in English. I recommend this for kids that speak Spanish - and that also want to play chess. This a wonderful game that will help anyone learn to play chess - even if they don't know anything about the game before.
1,They don't last long,"I bought my first one and it was great but only lasted about 18 months. I bought a second one and it lasted only 15 months. I called Thane to see if I could get the part that failed and they told me that the part cost $13.00 but they could not sell it to me. I had to buy a new one. So, as good as this product performs, plan on buying a new one every few years. Or, ask them if you can get parts, if there is a failure, before you buy it. I am angry with this company and, even though it works well, I would never buy anything from Thane again."
5,24 HOUR TIMER,"I installed this timer on a mh and hps 400w lights 220v. It was very good price, Fast delivery, and easy to install."
3,Intermatic T104 208-277-Volt DPST 24 Hour Mechanical Time Switch,I purchaced this item in August 2012 and it works ok except the timer or clock is loosing time several hours over a 24 hour period I have contacted seller to resolve this problem Well I have contacted the seller to see if the clock could be calebrated but now they are saying that they did not sell it to me and it can not be adjusted and in other words piss off and buy another so I am not happy living in Australia I now have to spend more money buying another timer for my hot water service and start all over again.NOT HAPPY AT ALL
3,Okay,"Easy to install, good customer service, the only problem with this timer is the noise.Make sure to install it in places which noise is not an issue."
1,"No technique, poor characters","I ordered this book through the mail without previewing it and I was quite disappointed. The characters that he presents are flat and lifeless and he does not give any worthwhile carving technique. The only saving grace this book might have is that it does have a few interesting patterns. If you like to carve interesting characters, this book is not for you"
2,"Brazil Agate, 1lb.",I am very disapointed with the color quality of the stones. I can find the same rock right here in Idaho.
5,this book is very good for my job in the university.,I need this book for a new advanced organic chemitry class that i'll minister next year in the post-graduate program in my university.
1,Wretched version,Take a look at the free sample and you'll see it's a mess--no attempt to mend the scanner's howling errors. And they're charging money for this? Keep yours in your pocket.
4,"I want to give five stars, but I can't.","The radio edit of march of the pigs is just that... maybe one word is skimmed over and the song continuity remains intact. It's a good song, but I've got the Downward Spiral, so... The remix, however (all the pigs, all lined up) is thoroughly awesome. It uses some great industrial and techno elements including various samples and breaks which only seem to ADD to the song continuity. Also, a violet fluid is truly a masterpiece in miniature (like 1:09 miniature). It is great for inspiring feelings of mechanistic conquest, a good soundtrack to march to. Lastly, big man with a gun is still cool, but does appear on the Downward Spiral. I am still looking to buy disc two."
5,Best in the series (so far)!,"I've been reading these books in the series in order, and this is the best so far!! Lee Harris has done an admirable job weaving the clues, suspicions, and ""red herrings"" for not just one mystery but two in this 6th entry of the Christine Bennett series. Natalie Gordon disappeared over a year ago at a Thanksgiving Day parade, and her husband is desperate to find the love of his life. While investigating this mystery, flashes of memories come back to Christine to a life before her parents died, and they raise suspicions that the father she dearly loved was not was he seemed. Couldn't put this one down, and can't wait to get to the next!! Enjoy!"
5,Welsh Dictionary,"This has been very helpful in the Welsh class I have been taking. It's quite easy to read and understand. I wish it had a pronounciation guide, however. A handy book to have around."
5,ALABAMA RAP!,"this is a very tight cd that came out in 2002 on NFINITY MUSIC,outta Montgomery,Alabama.it features DIRTY and they are all over this cd.this cd is pretty rare and i will sell mine for a good offer.also have 100`s of other rare out of print cd and tapes for sale.EMAIL."
3,The Worth of Words,"The application of Lacanian psychoanalysis to Romantic poetry argues for the constitutive rather than expresseive modalities of signification. In thier attempt to de-phallicize language and experience, the three poets Claridge brings under her purview enigmatically reinscribe its structures. Those failures, however, enable the poets to keep writing, penning away in search of a prelapsarian mode of apprehending exteriority, the landscape of course serving as interlocutor between it and interiority. (Pater, himself a belated Romantic, will aver at the end of the century that the difference between the two is merely putative). Within a Lacanian economy, the worth of words is simply that we are worst off for having them, but Nietzsche already knew this when he said that languge marks the weight of something already dead within us.A solid contribtuion to a growing field of study, and thus recommended."
4,Good product,So...just got this in the mail. Note. The rubber lid is not included. Not that you really need it as it will work with the one that came with your jet boil. It made a great pot of coffee. It even kept all the grinds out while I poured the coffee in a cup. What I really like about it is the plunger shaft is really two pieces and unscrews to fit inside my Jetboil. There are even instructions on the package for how to stow it away with each type of Jetboil. Would definitely recommend
1,I 'was' so excited about this....,IF you can stand to have grounds in your coffee then this will work for you. I cannot. (aka...chewy Cowboy Coffee) Mostly because i use this only when hiking etc i constantly jump because i think it's a bug in my mouth and i can't get past that. Of the 3 tbsp's of coffee that is recommended at least 1/4 of a tbsp ends up in my cup. I'm hoping the company on Amazon will let me return it. I have a small Bodrum coffee press that i'm using instead.
2,Not bad...,"Steven Seagal's movies are getting really predictable. The action is good but again very predictable. And what really brought down my rating is that I HATE to have to read subtitles when they talk in a foreign language such as Chinese in this case. You have to read more than half of this movie in order to know what they are talking about (unless you understand Chinese, then good for you, but obviously I don't). In my opinion, when you need to read this much, you miss all the face's expressions, some action and the sense of the movie because you hurry to read in order not to miss anything visual in the action. The movie is not that great either. Try to borrow this movie if you can. Not worth the money spent in my opinion."
2,over and over again,"Once again Segall is a renagade c.i.a. man who has retired. But they keep calling him back to duty. This time the governer of Japan gets killed. Segall goes in and starts to kill the Yakasua.Alot of sub-titles in the movie which was shot overseas, so many of his co-stars are from Japan. Segall must not be credible in Hollwood any more. Its an o.k. movie I guess but, his flicks have taken a big downward turn in recent years. One note: if you have a home theater the dolby 5.1 soundtrack was quite good."
2,Not what it could have been...,"In Steven Seagal's A&E; Biography, he was very upbeat about his (at that time) upcoming feature, ""Into the Sun"". He touted it as the movie he had always wanted to make, his triumphant return to Japan for a big-budget Yakuza vs Seagal movie...so I had high hopes...which were dashed soon after the film began.The movie wasn't his worst, but it was not anywhere close to his best efforts, and isn't worth buying, in my opinion, as it doesn't bear repeated watching the way ""Out For Justice"" or ""Hard To Kill"" does."
3,Into The Sun,"Typical Steven Segal action. Lots of kung fu action. I love to watch in fight, but I swear he runs like a girl"
3,Not up to Steel's standards,"I have been with Danielle Steel through ALL of her books. This one was just not up there, did not hold my interest. Storm at the end was cute but you know it was coming. Mirror Image still the best for a while. I'll hang in there"
2,Boring,Danielle Steel can do so much better. This was not one of her classics. It wasn't too exciting and VERY predictable!! You knew what was going to happen from chapter one. She usually has more excitment and passion in her books. For those of you who have read it enter the trivia contest at her web site...I look forward to her next book maybe it will be classic Danielle Steel that we're all used to
1,Too bad there is no provision for 0 stars.......,"Probably her worst book yet, but then again all of her recent works have been extremely bad. India's husband Doug is not a very believable character. His total opposition to her work seems unrealistic. Paul is too good to be true and then again too wishy-washy... This book tested my patience..I was tempted to sail it through the window quite a few times. Longwinded, boring, lack of substance, no plot...horrible horrible book!!!"
4,"And,..And... And..","I enjoyed this book because of the storyline (which was,however, very predictable)despite the fact that every other word was and. My creative writing teacher would have given her no more than a c- for this endeavor. Has she always written like this or am I just becoming more aware of the mechanics of really creative writing?"
1,"very sappy, typical ""happily ever after"" ending","I was disappointed in this book. I usually enjoy her books as being sort of light reading, but interesting enough to keep me coming back. I could hardly get through this one. I had to force myself to finish it. I predicted the ending in the first 5 pages of the book. She is very predictable and so sappy that sometimes you just want to say ""yeah, right."" I am sure that I will give Danielle Steel another chance because usually her books hold my interest and are somewhat entertaining. This was just a bad seed."
3,"An easy ,fast read but disapointing","I am Danielle Steele fan and was surprised by this book. Lately her books seem so one dimensional. I read Bittersweet after reading A Mirror Image, which I enjoyed immensely and was very disapointed. Her characters seem so one dimensional and I can see this book turning into a mini series very soon. It seems many authors today, write as fast as they can to complete contracts and have lost track of the words of the heart."
2,I found this book very boring.,"Certainly not up to her ""Jewels"" status. This book constantly repeated things, became very, very boring. I would have stopped reading it but I wanted to see how it ended. I thought it would have a wonderful ending - not at all."
1,yuck,All I have to say is get a backbone girl! I don't respectanyone who can't stand up for herself. She took abuse and .... from her husband for far too long. I'm sorry but I've grown up believing in myself and never being dependant on anyone else. She never stood up for herself....she let her husband run the conversations and she let him dictate how she would lead her life. I really didn't like this book...I even skipped parts of it because I got so disgusted.
1,Bittersweet Boring,"The only reason that I finished reading this book is because I was waiting for something exciting to happen. Bittersweet is predictable, unrealistic, and repetitive. I didn't care for the main character, India, because I thought she was sappy. I'm switching to a different author."
1,The worst,I love Daniel Stell books but this one was horible.I have to admit I didn't finsh it but I got tired of how her husband treated her and she did nothing about it.But from what I've read from other readers I didn't miss much by not finshing it.
5,Pintsize Powerhouse,great product - and at this price - truly an amazing buy! you can't go wrong here.
4,An excellent intro to IEEE-1394,"The author does a very good job describing much of the IEEE-1394 specification. He breaks the spec down into a number of very clear and readable chapters that will enable you be well on your way to using the 1394 technology. Also, the diagrams and figures are very helpful -- especially when you compare to the layout of the actual specification.There are a few notable flaws, however. Though the cover says ""Includes 1394a"", it actually covers the preliminary version of 1394a (1998). This flaw is especially glaring since 1394a came out in 2000. Further, the book is pretty light on the OHCI for 1394 spec.In short, the book is very good at what it does, but needs to be updated and expanded."
4,Fab Cover Versions by Retro Masters,"This album has great personal sentimental value, as I bought the vinyl version in the summer of '78. I played it non-stop, along with Eno's ""Before and After Science,"" also released that year. So, perhaps my view is a bit clouded. But it has great cover versions, particularly the Byrds' ""Feel A While Lot Better"" and Beatles' ""There's a Place."" There's just a lack of guile and total sincerity about the way the Groovies approach the music of their heroes, even if they aren't the world's greatest singers and musicians. This isn't as good as the Roy Loney years, but it's still good."
5,Beyond the Literal,"""Yellowbrickroad"" is not your typical horror film. There isn't any nudity, nor is there any crazy partying/stupidity that occurs. However, it makes you think. Many reviews have mentioned that it's ""dumb"" or ""hard to follow"". Moviegoers are so accustomed to being spoon-fed boring plot and terrible acting. Then, a film like ""Yellowbrickroad"" comes along, and asks you to question it. It asks you to ponder after you leave the theatre. It goes beyond the thrasher movie. If you see it and feel confused-take a day or two, think about the woods as the main character, then watch it again. Focus on one character throughout and you will likely have a different opinion.Overall-it's a fantastic film that is both refreshing and challenging to the viewer. Bravo!"
1,yellowbrick road,"This movie started out well enough but began to delve deeper into total stupidity and nonsense. I was left with the question ""what just happen"" at the end of"
2,A bgoring moivie from start/finish,"as boring as this movie is, either we are 'treated' by the fact there is no CC or is it more appropriate to be thankfully spared even more drivel by not having CC. either way,this is going to be in someone's christmas sock!"
2,Not as expected,"I purchased this vitamin because of hair loss,did not see any difference at all or any other benefits from it."
4,Good but not as good as the biochemistry review,"I bought Lippicott's microbiology review, after having WONDERFUL success with their biochemistry review text. The one fundamental difference in the text books is that there is no summary at the end of each chapter. The summaries are awesome, and without them, this review series is not nearly as helpful."
4,Strong return,"Dust and Dreams is Camel's return to the limelight after years in the musical wilderness. And what a return it is. Even though this is the sound of a band that has seemingly slept through the 80s and 90s, this is a work of immense power, beauty and, dare I say it, dignity. The album's 14 tracks are elegantly crafted together into a seamless musical voyage through the dust-ridden epic of Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath. Inspired stuff, with Andy Latimer (writer, arranger, producer, etc) once again vying for the title of most Underrated Guitarists of Our Time. It's all very 1973, of course, but for those who are broad-minded enough to venture beyond the confines dictated to them by the music industry will find this a surprisingly good listen. Now where's that hubbly-bubbly?"
5,Awsome!,These speakers rock! i powered them with a 1000 watt amp and they really thumped when i wanted them too!
3,Good but...,"The litter is great -- clumps well, keeps smell down, the cats are happy with it. However, one of my cat's is a litter kicker and so it is everywhere (all over the house). I have tile on the floor the litter box is on and the little granules (like sand but a little bigger) get into the grout and have eventually worn some of the more traveled areas down (some of the grouting is almost gone). I've used Swheat Scoop about a year and half. I sweep regularly but as I said, my cat is a kicker. The other cat is just a magnet for any litter and carries it everywhere. Ever have cat litter in your bed? Yeah, you will if you use this. I have mats and take all the precautions possible but it still happens.I still buy it because it works but I'm looking for other alternatives for the sake of my floors."
1,moths,Stay away from this product. At first it seemed to be working really great. Then I noticed some movement in the litter bin and I am not refering to BM) and discovered it had a nice colony of mealy worms. Eventually we had a moth problem throughout the house. Swheat scoop folks really didn't have a solution but also did not deny that the litter was the problem.
3,my cat nibbles it!,"I wasn't totally satisfied with The World's Greatest Cat Litter re clumping and odor control, so I started transitioning to Swheat Scoop. Seemed great in terms of no dust and at least ok in terms of odor control, but both yesterday and today I ""caught"" my darling cat sniffing it a lot and then, to my horror, she nibbled a little bit. (Yesterday I thought maybe I was imagining it) Back to the drawing board..."
2,Sweaty Work cleaning box with SwheatScoop,"Loved the name, loved the concept. I tried this for several months, but I finally switched to Nature's Miracle.Here's why I switched:1) Hardened clumps impossible to get out of box-even used screwdrived as chisel (old-fashioned wheat paste is glue for a reason-it works)2) Strange fermenting dough smell if box not thoroughly cleaned daily3) Large Dough clumps clog toilet when flushed even if waiting until softened.4) IF not flushed, still fairly heavy to take out.5) This product appears identical to the wheat germ in my kitchen-my cats would eat it on occasion when it was fresh. I decided that I didn't feel comfortable with the idea that my cats were possibly urinating into food-grade grains when there are starving people all over the world"
4,bay leaf for the moths,"I've been using Swheat Scoop for years - switched from World's Best(which, alas, had too much dust for me. Swheat Scoop is fine with the cats and doesn't get tracked around as much as some other brands.There is a problem with food moth infestations in our now hotter summers. Cure: crumple up a few bay leaves in the open litter tray and pop a few in the bag of unused litter. This also works to protect your herbs, dried beans, grains, etc."
2,"Sturdy, but poorly designed","The bins are reasonably sturdy. If you plan to set them, one bin high, on a shelf, no problem. Otherwise, you might want to avoid them. You have to fidget them around in order to stack them. This to the extent that you might need to remove the bottom bins from the shelf and hold them in your hand in order to nestle the to-be-added bin onto the top of the stack. As for hanging on pegboard, they hang with their base at about a 20 degree angle (from horizontal) on 1/8"" pegboard and about a 40 degree angle on 1/4"" pegboard. Then, as you add more and more weight, they begin to level out somewhat. I didn't like the look (with each bin at a different angle, depending on weight) and chose to remove the pegboard tabs and, in their place, drill holes on the back side, suitable for hanging the bins on conventional pegboard hooks."
3,Stach-On Bin-6 Storage Organizer Bins,This item did not set flush to my pegboard. I will need to drill two holes through the back panel of this item and into my pegboard. Then add two screws.
1,tiny,waste of money unless your trying to just blow some cash... way too small to use for anyting other than thumb tacks. i would rather not spend 12$ on a thumb tac container
5,Love these!,Great organizers! Easy to install on pegboard...and they come in different sizes too! Planning on ordering more cuz I'm not done organizing all my stuff!
2,"not too bad, considering... but not good","First a word of warning, this book requires that you read the other 2 first, about Dalden's sister and mother, or it'd be really confusing.Actually, even if you read the others, this book is not up to par. Science fiction, imo, doesn't mix well with fantasy, especially if it tries to cross with reality. The practicality, or rather unpracticality, doesn't seem to cross her mind, and is shrugged off nonchalantly. Also, Britanny, supposedly a modern woman, capitulates way too easily to the way of the barbarians. It doesn't fit, as time-travels don't fit.Otherwise, I think this book is more or less the same as all the recent Lindsey books, not bad exactly, but definitely not as good as her older books (the Mallorys)."
2,Heart of a Warrior,No her best work in fact compared to the first two books in the series this one is pretty bad. While the story line is okay the passions and exprtise that Johanna Lindsey is known for are absent -- it is almost like she wrote this book in one afternoon.
2,I did regret buying it,"I was very disapointed with this book for which I did wait so much. It is perhaps interesting to Science Fiction funs, but there is pracically no romance in it. The relationships are empty and I am sure the author could have done more. She did not put any heart in it so I do not think I will ever buy a book from her.I should have read and listened more to the others writing about it. I do not agree the Sensualility rating about the book either, as the emotion is lacking."
3,Disappointing character development,"The third book in the ""warrior"" series was not all I thought it would be. I enjoy all of Lindsey's novels, and I do mean all of them. The plot is interesting, but for that reason the book doesn't let us get into the character's heads as much as previous works. The main male character, Dalden, is not developed as well as it could be. All we really see is that he is the son of Tedra, the brother of Shanelle, and is gorgeous. I was waiting for some more insight. But I am not completely down on this book, don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the way Lindsey described earth and it's inhabitants.I will always enjoy Johanna Lindsey. I just wished I would have borrowed this one, not bought it. The first two books leading to this should definitely be read before this one-""Warrior's Woman"" and ""Keeper of the Heart""-so the reader has an adequate background on Dalden and the other characters."
2,Did not live up to expectations.,"I was so excited when I found this book, I had just been telling somenone that I wish I knew when Dalden's story was going to come out. Now I wish that it still had not. Brittany is great on earth, but is a major wimp in Daldens world. She refuses to believe that she is not on some major sound stage. Get real! There is no sizzling passion between Dalen and Brittany, I am not sure why he wanted her. If you want great stories read the 1st 2. I loved Tedra and Shallens stories, they were literally out of this world. This one has more dynamic between Tedra's computer Martha and Brittany than Dalden and Brittany. Wait for paperback, used bookstore or paperback!! Too bad, I was really looking forward to it too."
2,Stay Grounded (on Earth),"I have read and loved every Lindsey novel...except this one. Had I even guessed from the back cover that it was a continuation of the outer space series I would have walked on by. Its confusing and disjointed, jumping from one thought to the next. Throughout the book I wondered what was in the heroine's head. She spends most of the book believing the hero was a nutcase pulling a very elaborate hoax on her. And this is who she loves??? I also spent a good portion of my reading time wondering what to make for dinner, what to wear for work the next day, what kind of cake to serve for my daughter's birthday. In other words, this story definitely does not bring the reader into the storyline."
1,Terrible,"I have read several books by Johanna Lindsey and enjoyed them all. However, this book was terrible. It was boring, slow and the heroine was extremely annoying. She spent most of the book thinking that it was all an elaborate hoax and kept coming up with the most ridiculous explanations for the things she was seeing. I normally reread books several times but this one has been relegated to the attic and I dont expect it will be coming down again anytime soon. Dont bother with this book its not worth the money nor the time and effort it takes to get through it."
1,Very very disappointing!,"I couldn't believe this was a Johanna Lindsey! I was sceptical when I read about the storyline, but hey this was Dalden, brother of Shanelle and son of Tedra, so I had to buy it. Big disappointment. Dalden never came to live, and apart from fysical attraction between Brittany and Dalden I couldn't see why they would get together.The most annoying part was Brittany's unrelenting disbelieve that anything she saw was real. I kept hoping it would get better, but it didn't.The only interresting 'character' was Martha, Tedra's Mock II computer, with her wicked sense of humor.So safe your money, it's not worth it."
3,Shifting from Historical,"Well, I have never been disappointed by Johanna Lindsey's books but I have to say I was never too keen on the 2 that she has written set in the alien world like Warrior's Woman. Somehow it just doesn't feel like a Historical novel any more and it's hard to get a grasp on the planets and new names given to certain things. If you start the book, you'll have to finish it in one go or else if you get back to it a few days later, you'll find you might have forgotten some things."
2,I'm not paying for a hard back again,"I had high hopes as I enjoyed the first two books of this series, but they were dashed. I broke a rule of mine to not pay for a hard back of Lindsey's again because they haven't had the fun, sex and romance that got me hooked years ago. But Dalden's story had to be good right? More like Martha's story-I've had enough of her ""Babe"". I just hope that Jeremy Malory's long awaited story will have that same old magic. My advice-wait for the paperback and even then at the used book store. You know I'm really not bitter just a disappointed long term fan. Who body snatched one of my favorite authors?"
2,"Where's the heat, the sexual tension, the excitement?","Yikes, what a disappointment. Too much time is spent with Martha the Computer and not enough with the warrior. Brittany's not believing what they tell her gets boring pretty quickly.There were some missed opportunities for developing the story. For example, Dalden goes off to talk with his father about his lifemate. He comes back and they go on a ""honeymoon"" of sorts. Why not write a chapter about this visit with dad. The characters of Challen, Tedra, Shanelle, etc. are barely around.This was a lazily written book."
1,"spit, spit, spit","No juicy scenes, no steamy debates, no humor. NOTHING!The annoying computer needed to be unplugged. Brittany was dim. I can't compare this to anything else JL has written. I kept thinking -- is some kinda joke!?! Who wrote this crap?Lindsey was my favorite. If this were my 1st by her, I'd be done."
2,Indifferent at best,This is certainly not one of Johanna Lindsey's best works. My disappointment stems from the fact that this is the third in a series of spine-tinglingly great books and it just doesn't measure up at all. The storyline is very weak and doesn't contain Lindsey's normal twists and turns. I'd recommend reading this only if you are dying to find out what happens to Tedra's son.
3,"OK, good idea","A very good idea and wish it came with the real music. The main huge problem is that the tracks of music are just someone playing the samples with low quality sounds on a synthesizer or piano instead of the real recording of the artist's music that would excite the students. The concept is great though, hope they fix it."
3,Go to the local bookstore to preview first,"There are a lot of 'easy' recipes (melt/mix and you're done), and a few completely unrealistic recipes (who can REALLY make ribbon candy at home?)I got the book on sale, and I love collecting cookbooks, so I don't consider it money wasted, per se. But, I've only used a couple of the recipes/ideas from this book; most are a little too simple for my tastes."
5,Exellent study of Central Asia,"An exellent book (if a little hard to find) covering the history of Central Asia (Turkisan) roughly from the Arab conquest up to the Mongol invasion and settlement.The book goes into detail the political relations between the rulers of Turkistan with its Arab and Persian neighbours including every detail, money used, social and political relations etc.The book also goes into detail about the Mongol conquest starting with the initial reasons for the invasion down to the Mongol settlement and colonisation of Central Asia.An exellent book well worth a read for anyone with an interest in Islamic history and culture."
5,Paul is the American Hero!,"In my opinion, these books of Alger's are better today than back when first written! His powerful and inspirational works have been described as rags to riches stories, illustrating how down-and-outs, poor or broke men and women, even kids, can achieve the American Dream of wealth and success through hard work, courage, determination, enterprise and concern for others.2010 is the best year for Alger! Rediscover him today! One of his best books, read it and pass it on - it will only help the economy! :)Each of his many wonderful and captivating stories involves Alger's main character achieving extreme wealth and the eventual elimination of their ""old ghosts"" or enemies. While Alger is noted as a significant figure in the history of American cultural and social ideals is message still needs to be heard more today, in our present economic situation.Truly great story!"
4,Good Album,"The only reason I gave this album 4 stars is cause it got to the end before I was ready. All the songs are great, but one that really stands out to me is Meagallah. He is a very deep artist and his lyrics reflect the way it is in real life."
5,Forché sees evil & names it,"Forché's poems of El Salvador in the late '70s/early '80s, in the first half of this book, could as well be written about Bosnia, Somalia, Rwanda, Chechnya, or any of another dozen places that are sites of contemporary atrocity. And the U.S.: where all of us, so many of us good people, yes, good people, live on the uppermost levels of a structure of corruption and shame, which we fail, in our stubborn blindness, to recognize: ""...I go mad, for example, / in the Safeway, at the many heads / of lettuce, papayas and sugar, pineapples / and coffee, especially the coffee"" (""Return,"" 19). Forché's purpose is not to give us the guilts, nor to turn us into evolutionaries, nor to congratulate herself as someone who is ""aware,"" but to bring witness of objective conditions of evil in which we, as American citizens and consumers, participate."
4,Say anything (1989),"[...]Fresh and sensitive depiction of life's joys, doubts and insecurities. Cute, emotional, and quite funny in an understated way.One of the truly great teenage romances. In my book of beautiful unpredictability."
2,Boring and waay overrated.,"Dull attempt at a romantic film. I didnt like or identify with any of these characters. I found myself disliking all of the self-absorbed twits that I was supposed to have feelings for. Sorry, but i fail to see what the fuss is about."
3,Stops splashing,"I have a couple of cats that love to play with the water bowl. They splash water everywhere. This bowl has stopped that activity completely. No more wet floors or furniture. If you have the same problem, I highly recommend this water bowl.Update: I've had this bowl for about two months and it stops my cats from splashing, but the lid is splitting in two different places. Needless to say, I am disappointed with the overall quality of this product."
1,A Strange Shobin Show,"David Shobin shows skill in some of his descriptive narrative; but the loose, unsuspenceful and chaotic plot of ""THE PROVIDER"" totally fails to engage this reader.The main villains are unconvincing, and Brad ( the hero ) vacillates like the valves in a heart. Brad's heroine is interesting but never fleshed out. None of the main characters are believable or engaging; all of the characters are cardboard cutouts or chararactures, or both.There was no resolution to the story, simply a fire that destroyed the scene of the final agony.One suspects the manuscript ought to have been in that fire."
3,"Good feel, but didn't hold up all that well","Good balance and I enjoyed the feel in my hands as well as coming off the drum head. I've played with rods for some time, and even with controlled force on the heads and cymbals, they started coming apart in only a few hours. If you are very very very careful, you may enjoy these, but I'll be trying another product."
5,The best book I have read in a long time.,"I love reading about the past wars and getting the inside look at them. The one thing that I really loved about Stones From The River is that it didn't give you a general overview of the life people lived during the war with Hitler, but it gave you a close up look at some of the trials and tribulations that the people of the town went through. Following Trudi through her struggle of discovery you find yourself questioning,wondering and discovering the new ideas right along with Trudi. I for one can not relate with Trudi and what she lived through, but Hegi does such a good job at writing I almost felt like I could. I would really recomend this book and her other Salt Dancers to anyone who is in for the discovery of the real truth to life."
2,(wienerj@juno.com) Boring...But Very Real,"The main character Julia seeks to understand her childhood and family prior to giving birth to her own child. This book describes the impression that parents leave on their children for life. Child abuse and abandonment trouble Julia. Theseare topics that need to be discussed more often.I did not like the authors style of writing and found myself struggling to continue this book. To some extent my feelings and desire to stop reading this book may be reflecting a common attitude in society... I'd rather pretend that these things don't happen and when they do they are not my problem. When I realized the subject matter, I simply lost interest."
4,good fit and look,Love this team and the hat is a good look and fits well. Only problem is the red logo has bled slightly into the white. Its hardly noticeable though.
5,my first SQL book,"I have used a variety of SQL applications for over a decade now, and always used the reference documentation from the vendor. That does work just fine, but it left me ignorant of the greater SQL market, tools that the versions I was using didn't have, and better ways of dealing with common problems.I have never found such an easy to comprehend explanation of the types of joins. I read this book 3 months ago, and just yesterday pulled it off my shelf to write a moderately complex query. I still could have done the job without it, but then I would have had to write 20 more lines of perl code, instead of one well written query.I am a better SQL DBA having read the book, and its a valuable reference. How much more could I ask?"
5,Learning SQL,"Very good book for beginning. Plenty of examples, and explanations.Plus author writes in very good manner, so you feel like having teacher sitting next to you"
2,the car,in the car by gary paulsen there were manyinteing pointy.terry got a car and he named the car the cat.terryhada car accident and the car boken. so terry had to fix the cat
2,The Car by Gary Paulsen,The book The Car is a suspense and a mystery book that gets you into it at the very beginning of the book. at first the only character that you know for the first three chapters is Terry the main character who is a boy that is 13 years old. It is a very confusing beginning at first but you find out more and more as you go on. Terry is a single child whose parents dont pay much attention to him as much as they used to. Also his parents are on the verge of breaking up and leaving each other forever.One night his parents dont come home and call him and tell Terry that they have had enough with their sspouse and will never come home again. so Terry thinks fast and remembers that he has an uncle in Portland and builds a car to drive all the way there. but i wont tell you what happens next on his wild and crazy trip to Portland.
3,Smells like Armani Aqua Di Gio,"When I first put this on, I felt as if I've used this cologne before. then I realized that this cologne smells very similar to Armani Aqua Di Gio.Scent does not last all day. Not really sure if I will buy it again."
2,"Sad, sad product",Knives we have do not fit and product is not as expected. Wife does not like it. I think I will return it.
4,Good basic bag,"This is a good bag for basic use, but it could use a few more useful pockets for thermometers, pens/markers, and other similar things. The pockets on this bag that were made for this a a little small for some of those things I carry. Otherwise, I have no complaints and use the bag every day."
2,Too Little Info About Too Many Indicators,It's a DECENT quick reference. There are far too many indicators presented for any particular one to be meaningfully covered. I suppose that it's an alright book to have to have on the shelf...just don't expect too much. You can probably find most of the info for free from various online sources.
5,There is nothing like this book,"I own a lot of books on investing and technical analysis and can say there is nothing like this new edition from Mr. Achelis. Yes, the discussions on each indicator are brief (2 to 4 pages), but there are something like 130 indicators! And unlike the first edition (which I recall reading that it had sold almost 100,000 copies), the new edition shows the MATH behind almost all the indicators (no other book I've seen covers the calculations on so many indicators). Even if you own the first edition, this is worth the money."
4,"Concise Encyclopedia of Many Trading Indicators, Patterns and Terms",The book is very thorough and offers a concise definition with examples of many Indicators and Chart Patterns. It does not intend to be a definitive treaty on any one particular point but merely offers an introductory explanation for the reader. It is an excellent reference book that every trader should have in their library.
5,zen buddhism dvd,This is an excellent look at a Korean zen retreat that shows the dedication and joyfulness of the nuns who participate in this intensive practice. The film is very moving and inspiring. I highly recommend this dvd. It is a film with depth and beauty - excellent in every way.
5,"Nice remaster, but better?","Being a long-time fan of Crosby, Stills, and Nash, and especially of their first album together, I bought this CD. It is a fine remastering. Just to compare, I went to my local library and borrowed the CD. My library has the Atlantic remaster of 1994 (Atlantic 82651). That is a fine remaster, too. I put both CD's in my player. The Audio Fidelity remaster sounds fine. But so does the 1994 Atlantic remaster. The difference is not that great. I think the strings in the Audio Fidelity remaster sound a bit richer and overall the album sounds, shall I say, brighter, more strident, if you will. And as I've noticed in a lot of remasters, the bass is amped up. But not the volume, thankfully. Many remasters are way louder, perhaps because of an improved signal-to-noise ratio.I'm not disappointed in the Audio Fidelity effort, but you can probably find the Atlantic remaster of 1994 at half the price of the AF, and the difference is almost indistinguishable."
1,Dated Hippe Rot!,Oh dear! This really if the epitome of smug hippy rot that gave youth culture a bad name. Avoid this nonsense hippy garbage. It's dated and has a really stale sound!
2,Worst (Re)mastering,"It's hard to believe, in this day and age of digital (re)mastering, that a CD would sound as bad as this one. It's like a trip back to the past when CDs had a bad reputation for sound quality. It's hard to believe Steve Hoffman had anything to do with this CD, other than copying and pasting what Rhino Records provided. I do appreciate everyone's comment on sound quality, but this CD, finding tape hiss noise, is far from anything to applaud."
1,REPLACED BY 2005 REMASTER,"This is the same remaster that Graham Nash supervised in the early 90's, that was available on the domestic Atlantic CD.Both of these discs have now been superceeded by a new Rhino remastered version with 4 extra tracks.However, as Rhino is just commencing a 2006 reissue/remaster campaign of the entire catalog, it would be a big waste of money to buy this import."
4,Good album for CSN fans!,"Good mix of songs, remastered pretty well! Pleasantly surprised on the remastering quality. Made for a good addition to my library."
4,a bit smaller then expected,it's a cute bikini but it was smaller then most size medium underwear i'm use to. may be better to order one size up then usual.
2,"""Natural"" color is actually brown",Color shown as natural is far from accurate. I am unhappy with color and may return these.
1,"Great book, but DON'T BUY THIS EDITION!","I recently ordered this book after reading Tozer's The Knowledge of the Holy this summer. I was very excited to read this book, as it is another of Tozer's classics. HOWEVER, DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION OF THE BOOK. IT IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE! THERE ARE SO MANY TYPOS THAT DISTRACT FROM TOZER'S WRITING. I regret buying this version, and I will probably buy a different version of the book. I am very surprised that this edition even went to print. AMAZON, PLEASE DO NOT SELL THIS FLAWED PRODUCT!"
4,The Aroma of Heaven Clings to the Pages of this Book,"Tozer speaks as one who has been in the presence of the King and the aroma of heaven clings to the pages of his book. The Pursuit of God was one of the first really great books I read. One of my mentors loaned it to me when I was nineteen years old and facing a period of decisive surrender in important areas of my life. The second chapter, called ""The Blessedness of Possessing Nothing,"" was especially meaningful to me. Everything Tozer wrote was good and I could give a blanket recommendation to his other works. His books are brief, but not shallow. I highly recommend The Pursuit of God. Follow it up with Man: The Dwelling Place of God, another of Tozer's great books."
5,Not for the Timid,"This is a book that is not for those who are of the faint of heart. The burial party in Elisha's day, when fleeing from the invading Midianites, threw the corpse into Elisha's tomb. When the dead man's bones hit Elisha's dead bones the corpse sprang to life. Likewise this book's content will ignite the flame of one's cold heart.Tozer strips away the religious forms that keep us from truly following God. In reading this book one will be instructed to do real soul searching and get to the business of seeking the face of God. When the spade work is done, as in gardening, Tozer lets us know that God is here with us. We are never nearer to God than we are right now. Our duty is to seek Him."
2,To theoligaical for me,I started reading the book & just found that this wasn't a book that I could understand very well.So I stopped reading it.I'm sure it's very informing for those who know more about A.W.Tozer & his beliefs.
3,Deep thought..,A.W. Tozer sure gives you different food for thought which is always good while growing in Christ...buy it and pass it on!!
4,"Overlooking minor discrepancies, a convicting read","This book is very well organized, and I agree with much of it. There is much emphasis on the EXPERIENCE of God over doctrine, which I strongly believe in as well. One issue I had was that there seemed to not be a clear distinction between the soul and the spirit, which are two very different things. The spirit is the organ with which we contact God and have fellowship, and the soul is the constitution of our mind, emotion, and will- our personality, in short. Other than that, an inspiring read.Lord, May you take away my pride and ambition and self-glory. May you lift the burdens of this earthly world from my shoulders and fill me with lowliness and meekness. But Lord, I wish not to be a mere good man- I want to be a God-man. Only by your strength and mercy can I be useful for your purpose and expression!"
1,How disappointing,A true joy to read until the author spends the last chapter for no apparent reason bashing the Catholic faith?
5,Excellent,"I am seeking a deeper knowledge of GOD and went to tower. I was not disappointed. Easy reading, deep insight and as he said, if the desire goes beyond satisfying the mind, this is a must read."
5,God everyday,I highly recommend this book to every christian believer because it reminds the reader how much God loves us and what Jesus Christ did for believers at the cross. I enjoyed every page of this book.
4,The Pursuit of God AW TOZER,"Thought provoking and scripture based. A valued tool for those whom really hunger and thirst, and inquire in the prayer closet."
5,VERY FINE,"This book hits the mark. Simple and direct. A book by those who truly know how writing artistically works. How to use more powerful words, to observe life, to write a character with real depth. Wonderful prompts all through. Authors share wisdom's own keys to this art."
4,Modular cabinet system,"This book provides a good starting place for developing your own modular cabinet system. Excellent concepts and ideas. Bring your good sense and woodworking skills and mix them with this book to develop a system that works for you. Overall, this is a good book for ideas and techniques. It definitely needs to be customized to your shop, skills and tools."
1,Near worthless.,"Yes, yes we ALL know the ""Return of Starbuck"" is the only decent episode here. Is this really worth buying? Maybe for five bucks. But twenty? No, not for me anyway. If you find yourself absolutely needing to purchase this, don't open it. Just oogle the beautiful photoshop cover. It would be much, much more satisfying than viewing the contents."
1,Only 1 episode is worth it,"I remember these shows, and in a single word they sucked. I did not enjoy the recycling of footage from the 1970s episodes.Stay away from this box set.With that out of the way, only 1 episode was worth watching, and is the only redeeming value to this series (I am talking about the 1980 series not the rest), and yes you guess it Starbuck."
1,Battlestar Bad-actica,Never was a classic show so trashed as with this follow up piece of you know what!I had hoped to forget it ever existed.... too late.
3,Doomed From The Start,"I'm a fan of the ORIGINAL series. But Galactica 1980 was doomed from the start. The biggest problem was Dr. Z. No offense to the kid that played the part, it's just that the character was not needed and even took away from the series. To see Adama go to Z for advice or even instruction was demeaning and degrading to the character of Adama. If I had the software to edit DVD's, I'd take out every scene with Z in it."
1,It depends on your point of view,"I have two seperate ratings for this particular show. First, when compared with the original series it gets maybe a half of a star on a good day when I'm in a somewhat decent mood. The writing sucked and the acting was even worse. I think it could be described as a live action Saturday morning cartoon. It's like the main characters of the show were kids and they seemed to be the only ones on the show who knew what they were doing and or talking about. Adama is reduced to some kind of bumbling bafoon and the fleet is entrusted to somekind of a child super genious.However, second, when compared to the crap that is passing off as Battlestar Galactica today on the Sci-Fi Channel (or as it should be known as, ""Death To A Classic""), Galactica 1980 gets about 563.2 stars on a bad day."
4,"Not Perfect, but better than the modern BSG!","I must have seen every episode of this series when it came out as a seven year old boy back in St. Louis and I LOVED it! Sure it has some campy moments, but so did the original, and maybe it played up to kids a little too much, but hey I WAS a kid. I saw this entire series awhile back on the Sci-fi channel and loved every episode. There was so much potential! It should have lasted longer! This DVD collection is a must buy for me.P.S. The ""Return of StarBuck"" episode is great, but the Holloween 2-parter is a much more fun episode and is where HUMAN Cylons appear for the first time."
2,Worthy Only If You're a Fan,"If you love all things Battlestar Galactica then this is a must own, but I doubt many people will be watching any episodes twice, with the exception of the Starbuck guest star episode which might get a second glance. This series was guilty of so many sins of television (so many there's no point in going through all of them) that it couldn't help to be awful.Worth your time only if you're a BSG completist (hence the two stars) but otherwise follow the course of many BSG fans and consider this not in continuity with the original series and stay clear."
3,Worth Watching,"I enjoyed watching the episodes because I finally was able to learn how the show ended. The acting was not great and I missed the space scenes, but the series focused on the how the technologically advanced people from Galactica were going to find a home amongst the citizens of earth. I thought that each episode did a good job telling the story. The last episode, the return of Starbuck was the highlight of the series."
2,There is only one real BSG!,"There is only one real Battlestar Galactica and this is not it! Do not confuse this with the original cast or series which is far superior. The original BSG was canceled and when ABC realized they screwed up they scrambled to come up with a second season. However, most of the actors had gone one to other projects. This horrible series was hacked together and tried to capitalize on the Galactica name.I gave this 2 stars because it has the Return of Starbuck. They real Starbuck. You know, the MAN."
4,Deep Purple Rocks Again!,"This is the legendary bands first release with guitar god and former Dixie Dreg, Kansas and solo artist Steve Morse. He takes over the guitar duties from the departed Richie Blackmore. What a compliment he adds to this classic band. With all the original members including; Ian Gillian on vocals, Roger Glover's pounding bass lines, Jon Lord's classic keyboards, Ian Paice on drums, and Morse's strong playing, the band is back to it's classic form. Sometimes with the addition of a new member in a band it changes the dimension or sound of the band. This is not the case. Morse is a huge Deep Purple fan and his addition to the fold shows his appreciation and respect for the band. But he doesn't go for a Blackmore sound-alike. He adds his own style and playing to the band and it really works! This is a really great rock album!"
2,Healthy but tastes awful!,"I've been in search for healthy, good tasting bars so when these were on sale, I went ahead and ordered a box (especially with the few positive reviews here). Based on the ingredients and nutritional value, I think it's a pretty healthy choice. Unfortunately, it tastes awful. The bar itself is very dry and dense (like dry fruitcake) and with all the ""greens"" they've packed into this bar, it literally tastes like grass. Also, the main ingredient is dates so that's another predominant flavor - I didn't taste much blueberry. So I guess if you're someone who doesn't mind the taste of dates and grass...then this bar is for you."
5,Perfect,"These were just what I needed, and they were delivered promptly. Couldn't have asked for more."
2,Not A 'Custom Fit',"This is NOT custom fitted for my vehicle. It is a fairly generic 'trim to fit' floor mat that doesn't fit any better than cheap, generic mats. It does appear to be fairly heavy-duty, but I'm unhappy with the implication that it was made specifically for my vehicle."
1,Lasted about 2 weeks,"The spring retract mechanism very poor quality. Mine broke after about 2 weeks of daily use. The 'detent' that locks it in the extended position just quit working one day. The only solution was to destroy it and remove the cord for 'conventional' use. If you want or need this convenience, look elsewhere."
5,Poems and Stories to Connect with the Soul,"It is hard to know where to begin in a review of this collection of stories and poems evocative of the life and culture of the Native American people in today's society; life on the reservation, simply to say that the writing is fantastic... excellent and opens up your heart and soul to the myriad emotions held up like a mirror, right in your face.The language used is both poetic and earthy, uncomfortable at times, and yet makes you listen, draws you in and connects with you on a level that is deeply emotional, almost visceral and presents the subjects of his writing in a way that we cannot ignore or gloss over. Excellent writing, both in the stories and poems leaves us thinking deeply on all that we have read, and heard."
1,Lacks useful information,"This is one of the most disappointing books on turkey hunting that I own and I own quite a few. The author spends a great deal of time writing about Brad Harris and Mark Drury's hunting experiences but without conveying any significant amount of useful information. There is too much narrative and not enough wisdom. I would also steer clear of Turkey Huntings (sic) Finer Points by Daniel A. Dia Paul. I would recommend the following books which I have read: Hunting Pressured Turkeys by Brian Lovett; Practical Turkey Hunting Strategies by Ray Eye; Advanced Turkey Hunting by Michael Hanback; Successful Turkey Hunting by M.D. Johnson; In the Turkey Woods by Jerome B. Robinson; The Complete Book of Wild Turkey Hunting by John Trout, Jr.; and, Turkey Hunting Tactics of the Pros by Richard Coombs. For Pennsylvania hunters, I highly recommend A Guide to Hunting Pennsylvania Turkeys by Tom Fegely."
4,Good melodies and one great song merits 4 stars,"When I first bought this CD I just listened to the first 10 seconds of each song then it was put on a shelf and forgotten. Recently I pulled it out and realized it is not all that bad. Little Lamb Dragonfly and My Love are the best songs on the album but the melodies on the rest are just so catchy you find yourself humming them whether you like it or not. Little Lamb Dragonfly is just an amazing song, it is worth buying the album for this song alone. Buy this album you will end up loving it."
1,Disgrace,"When I first heard this album when it was initially released, I knew that my illusion was over, that the Beatles could do high quality work on their own on a consistent basis. I had suspected before this album that it might not be possible, but this fiasco clinched it in my mind. How could the guy who turned out classic song after classic song in each year from 1964 to 1969 put together such an uninspired, boring collection only a few years later? I am still amazed as I think about it today. This album stands as a monument to the decline of rock quality in the last three decades of the century."
2,So sad,"Poor old sausage! Mr McCartney has to be one of the most talented songwriters in the history of popular music but when unedited he turns out an embaressing mess.Personally I don't like My Love but I will admit it is a great love song. The medley at the end has four solid songs and is a lot of fun. The rest of the CD is very playful and was probably a blast to make but it feels like it was written and recorded in a week. This can work for some artists but not for Paul. Great guy, great talent but he needs help editing his work (you could say the same thing for Driving Rain).If you are a fan you probably have it already, if not try Wings at the Speed of Sound or Flowers in the Dirt."
2,McCartney Crashes,"Red Rose Speedway is the worst album in the Paul McCartney & Wings catalog. Mr. McCartney is a supreme songwriter and even the more trite songs in his career are well-crafted. But on this album, most of what he tries, fails. The medley on side two is obvious attempt at receating the Abbey Road medley. While no one would expect it to match up to that, you expect more than what is offered. ""Loup (1st Indian On the Moon)"", ""When The Night"" & ""Single Pigeon"" are among the worst songs of his career. There are some good songs on the album like ""Big Barn Bed"", ""Little Lamb Dragonfly"" and the number one hit ""My Love"". Though that song is often dismissed and criticized, it is what Mr. McCartney does best, simple love songs, well sung and well produced."
2,"""The Mess"" is right","I bought this album back in '73 based on the power of the flip side of the ""My Love"" single. ""The Mess"" was easily the coolest McCartney song I'd ever heard since the Beatles broke up (although Hi Hi Hi was close) and figured, well, even though it's not on the album (a mistake corrected by this CD release), SURELY most of the album rocks this hard.WRONG.Stupid Lyrics abound on this album. There's a reason ""My Love"" was the hit; like it or not, it's the best song on the record. ""Get on the Right Thing"" is a close second, but the rest of the album just sits there, astonishing you with its pretentiously bad lyrics.""Loup"" is nice, only because there's no lyrics. The Medley on the end of this album consists of three or four partial songs that Paul coudn't fill out to a full tune.Perhaps he kept ""The Mess"" off this album because he knew that if he didn't critics would use it to describe the album. Well, now that it's on here, it's the only reason to buy this mess is to get ""The Mess."""
2,Could be retitled Hollywood's Harlot,"Jean Harlow was an A picture star for MGM who filmed with Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy, and William Powell. No mention of them in the film. Here, she's just a bitchy B picture star for Majestic Studios, holding her professional virginity from a B cowboy star played by Mike Connors and making her queer husband Paul Berns (Peter Lawford) impotent. The real Jean Harlow had more dignity in her pinky finger than the character Carroll Baker portrays with her usual display of hysterics granted by a trashy script."
1,harlow would be disappointed...,I know I was. This movie is a horrid mess. Made no sense. Just throwing pies in the face. The movie was a total dump. If you want to see a Harlow bio watch Bombshell the one she done herself. Not this mess.
2,Buyer Beware,"B-sides & Early Stuff. I knew this before buying it, but I thought to myself ""sometimes B-sides are good, just not popular. and the early stuff MUST be good if they're still around."" I was wrong. I have listened to this a few times now, and I do not enjoy it. Breaks my heart to say it, since I am a huge DKM fan, but it's true."
3,comfortable pads....,"The soft pads feels very nice comparing to original belt comes with DSLR. However, the adjustable range is too limited so it's too long for my wife to use it. Also, the interchangeable connectors are good ideals but the releasable buckles at the end of the belt are kind of oversized. It always interferes with my eye glasses whenever I tried to shoot in verticle position, no matter I install battery grip or not."
4,nice strap,Overall nice strap. The card holder is a nice add-on. I'm sure it interfaces well with other lowepro products well. It has quick connect buckles very close to the camera so its easy to remove.The only negative about this product is the somewhat permanent crease in the padding where it was folded for display. It may work itself out eventually or there may be some trick to 'iron it out' so to speak.
1,Powerful Language?,"Powerful language?! Hah! As if! This is a young adult book, written in a weak young adult targeted age range. Even 9 year olds can understand this book, that's why I found this so unappealing, it's so inexclusive. Powerful language?! Hah!"
5,GOTTA READ IT!,"This book is the best book I've ever read in my entire life! (Well, at least one of the best books!) And not just the book, but the whole quartet! With all the talking to animals and little Kitten, this book was impossible to put down! The ONLY thing I thought was a LITTLE boring was the part with the chess game and all those strange dreams, I thought those were kinda useless. And I thought the romance between Daine and Numair was suprising, I've always thought of Numair as kinda of a fatherly guy that looks out for her, but as I read the book over and over and thought about it, its easy to see they're the perfect couple. This is a great series for anyone that likes adventure, romance, and all that good stuff! BUT you have to read the quartet in order cause I tried to read Wolf Speaker first and I was confused. And also, the Circle of Magic Quartet, Tamora's newest, ROCKS it is one of my favorites, you have to read it!!"
3,The Kindle Edition,"I purchased this book for my Kindle because I knew I liked it and would enjoy skipping to my favorite parts and rereading it. However the translation in the kindle edition is quite irritating. At first I noticed only little errors like forgotten apostrophes but as I read on I noticed that words were not misspelled but simply incorrect. For example instead of the word 'gentler' is the word 'gender'. This makes my reading far less enjoyable, I don't want to have to decipher what word should actually complete each sentence. It happens often enough in the story to be annoying but is not bad enough to ruin the plot. I just wish someone would take the time to correct it/type it up better."
5,Awesome Book!,"Oh my god! (or is that goddess?) This was such a good book. I got it and I just couldn't put it down! I loved the fact that there was some romance, and Tamora Pierce explained the battle so well, it felt like I was there. Oh yeah, and the darkings were SO cute!!!!"
2,"Simple book, Don't read at school","Not as filled with action or adventure, but a pretty welll written ending to Daine's story and life. I fully enjoyed her conversations with the famous Alanna and king richard much. But I would not recommend this as a book to read in school, it is too simple and not one a teacher would prefer you to read. This is not a thoroughly challenging novel, no interesting sub-plot and all, but this book is truely one for your free time, not for academics."
5,Done in a day!,"And that says something. Everyone's alreay described what this is about, so I won't.I really enjoyed this book. I personally felt it wrapped everything up pretty well. You hear from almost everybody, (Except Maura and the Long Lake Pack, unfortunatly) and any development that needed to be done was done. I knew that Daine and Numair would be the only couple that worked, but I was wondering after Emperor Mage how it would work - that was quite an age difference to work around. Personally, I thought it was pulled off well - the character's brought the age problem up themselves! Whoo! And I thought it was also done remaining true to the character's personalities. That was important, too.All in all, it was a well done ending to the story. I highly recommend it - it is a great fantasy for animal lovers, and for people who like romance. (You won't find so much in the other Immortal books. I think that's why THIS one had so much. :P)"
5,I forgod to breath while reeding this book ^.^!!,"If you`re telling me to grade this book out of 5, HOW ABOUT 5000! This book is packed with action, excitment, love and ect that I can not grade this out of 5. ( Oh! and I really did forget to breath by reading this.) And when I got to the end, the first word I said was "" Bummer!! There`s no more!! "" Anyway ME AND MY FRIENDS really recomend this book if you hadn`t got the chance to read this. ( Espesialy when your desperate for fantasy.) P.S I`m really excited about the new book she`s publishing."
1,Don't Waste Your Money On This Crap!,"All the tracks sound retarded, he sounds like he tryin to sing but can't. It sound more like a pop album than a reggaeton album. They try to incorperate some techno beats in like one of the tracks which sounds kinda weird mix with the reggaeton. I give it to the producers for tryin to update the reggaeton beat. If you are looking for true reggaeton artist, try looking Wisin & Yandel, Master Joe & OG Black, Don Omar, etc."
4,excellent,"This is not Can full cooked, but the stew has all the ingredients. Soundtracks are the groove pirates before Damo.The music here has good vocals, though not the devil magic the Sazuki wizard would soon bring to give Can an eternally indelible place on the map. You also get all the drones, long improvisations and Africa on speed drumming that Can would soon flesh out on albums likeTago Mago. This music is also--slightly-more dated. Listen to how out front the phased guitar is here. Can continued to use these for a long time after they went out of vogue, but wound them into a much richer mix.And low and behold a surprise ""She Brings The Rain"" is like psychedelic Wes Montgomery, nothing like they did after this. You can tell the band is still finding its way, but listening to Can stumble in the dark is still ten times better than hearing most bands having fully arrived."
2,Cute but frustrating,"Yup, tangly ribbons. ALL. THE. TIME. :( It's frustrating. I untangle them, and then, as I take buttons out of one page to use on another page, they get tangled again!The other thing is that, my buttons at least, don't want to stay in the cut-outs. My toddler WANTS them to go in and stay in! and he gets frustrated that no amount of pushing by him or I will get them to stay in some of the holes. :(All in all, I would not buy again and would not recommend."
2,One LAME Night,"You can't blame Dokken for jumping on the ""Unplugged"" fad of the mid-nineties. Business is business and anything beats getting a real job. The problem with this CD though is they sound completely bored and Don Dokken still talks to the audience as if they are still in junior high. I am not a fan of live albums anyway, so if you are a Dokken fanatic, maybe you'll agree with the other reviews here. Personally, I don't think they have done anything worth buying since ""Back for the Attack"". After that George Lynch ran out of steam. An ex-girlfriend gave me this disc for Christmas. (That's why she's my ex!) Seriously folks, this low-budget disc just doesn't deliver the goods."
2,Too general to be as helpful as could be possible,"I agree with another reviewer that there is not enough of how to do the tasks in question. There is a great deal of 'skimming' subjects without explanation leaving the reader to find out from other sources. For example, in Chapter 1, there are numererous mentions of HTTP/DAV and DAVEx (referring to the davex (DLL that handles communications between the Exchange back-end server and IIS) but there is no explanation as to what it does or how it works.The index (which I consider a must have in any technical book) is small and incidentally does not even mention the aforementioned davex.I found the lack of depth too light and somewhat frustrating.YMMV"
2,"Good food, annoying main character","I really tried to like this series. Most of the recipes look great, I enjoy the bits of history.... but the author's main character (Carolyn Blue) is so annoying it is jarring to the storyline and takes all the fun out of the books. I would like to be kind and call Carolyn naive, but after reading a couple of books in the series I have to say she's really just plain stupid. Unfortunately, her husband Jason is cut from the the same clueless cloth. Would love it if the author would give them each an IQ & common sense boost - it would improve the readability 100 percent."
1,A disappointing and painful read,"After the first few pages I knew this book was going to be a chore to read. As I continued I found not only did I not care what happened to the victim, but I wished somehow Nancy Fairbanks would figure out how to write all of these unlikable characters out of the ""plot."" This book seemed forced and contrived. As if the elements of a culinary mystery were being plugged into a formula. Usually, I love the pure entertainment and humor of these types of books. Nancy Fairbanks' Crime Brulee did not fit the bill. The one star is generous."
2,I don't get it,Being a long time reader of this incarnation of the JLA I was extremely disappointed with this collection of stories. There was no real tie-ins to the DC Universe or for that matter previous JLA stories. The stories seem forced and they didn't seem to flow like other stories. As a collector of the JLA tradebacks I consider this to be the weakest of them.
1,"Deeper and deeper, but somehow still quite shallow...","Deeper somehow manages to be quite literate, without being well-written. John Seabrook offers a technically well-constructed commentary on his experiences online, but his defensive tone turned me off. His relationship with technology seems quite religious in nature - simultaneously idolatry and uncomfortable. Not a book I'd recommend for the technologically literate reader, although those who prefer style to substance might enjoy it."
4,A Turning Point,"I just re-read this book, and I really enjoyed it again. This book contains some turning points in the story for some of the characters and it's one that you shouldn't miss! Right off the bat, you're hooked with a gruesome murder and it's hard to set it down once you've started reading this one. The book plays out great, and does a good job at intertwining another 30-year old mystery throughout. I thought the conclusion was suburb and unexpected (although reading it again I did pick up on some of the hints.)It is great for animal lovers, and the book does go into some more in depth knowledge, which for me growing up around Veterinarians I understood. None-the-less, it's still interesting and holds up the story.I still love all the characters, especially Aunt Tally! She's hilarious!"
1,Misleading,"Do not, do not, do not, buy this book. It is NOT what you think it is. Some of you may have stumbled across ""The Fighter's Notebook"" in the three ring binder. Like me, you most likely ended up here because you saw the price and thought you were getting a deal... but also like me... you'd be wrong. The majority of the description is wrong. The title of the book I actually received is called ""The Fighting Arts."" It isn't even close to being 600 pages! It is essentially a generic description of a wide variety of martial arts. If you're looking to learn some MMA, Jujitsu, or any list of techniques this is not the book you want. Spend the money and buy the $70 to $90 version."
5,A fourth season of great times!,"During this season,the inevitable happened. James Evans Sr.,portrayed by John Amos,was killed in an automobile accident. Amos was fired from GOOD TIMES in the spring of 1976 after a few offensive comments he made regarding the GT set. Joining the GT cast is Johnny Brown who plays the building superintendent. Brown's character is named Bookman. Bookman might have been mentioned several times in previous seasons."
3,Boring,"This book won't make you want to learn calculus because it's more boring than most textbooks. Extra explanations of concepts are always helpful, but you get explanations with every calculus book, so don't think that this book is something special."
2,The Blue Hour by T. Jefferson Parker,"When I purchased this book, I did so because of the positive reviews quoted on the cover and front pages, and because the description made it sound interesting. It was a struggle to read. I found that I really didn't care about the characters; in fact, I found them more than a little irritating. And the end, after the resolution of the case? Not very plausible, at least in my opinion."
4,The Blue Hour,"I really enjoyed the book The Blue Hour. There was only one thing that I did not like about the book. In the beginning, Merci is a cold hearted, crabby women. As the book goes on she gets kinda soft and does not seem like the same person. I also think that her and Hess' relationship seemed a bit far fetched. The story line however, was very good and hard to stop reading. I have never read one of Parker's books before but now I look forward to another one of his novels."
3,A quick guide for beginners; a refresher for veterans,"Yes, the facts are obvious, but at least they're neatly organized in a little pocket book. If you're selling or marketing to the rich and famous, this book tells how and where to spot this crowd. It's a quick guide for beginners and a refresher for veterans.Don't expect in-depth insider information though. Like most pocket books, it only touches the surface. One need to be constantly reading magazines that target at the rich and dive into the scene in order to really get in the know."
3,"Cute, but oh so tiny!","This teapot is very cute to look at, but it's totally unusable. Holds less tea then a Jumbo cup, and makes a mess when you pour. Decoration item only!"
3,"Cute, but flawed","I am a great fan of Fiestaware, but this teapot disappointed me. It looks cute, but the design is flawed: no interior strainer, so tea leaves easily clog up the spout and the handle gets hot."
3,Dog doesn't like this,"My border collie eats just about everything. At a year and 1/2 old, I thought he would gobble this down. He turns his nose up at it and actually eats half of what he regularly eat hours after he usually eats. I'll have to mix it with Gravy Train or something else he likes. Too bad...these large bags last a long time."
4,"good food, but price recently sky rocketed","This is a good quality dog food. About a month ago it was $31.79 with free shipping. I purchased two bags. It's about the same price as Purina and Pedigree, but a much higher quality product. It was one of the only meat-based dog foods at under $1/lb that I could find. However, the price has sky rocketed and is now $52 for the same size bag, so I didn't reorder. Instead, I purchased Intimidator dog food by Hi Tek. It was only about $35 for a 50 lb. bag with free shipping and has similar nutritional value to this dog food. I really hope Diamond Hi Energy costs go back to normal because I'd love to switch back, but not at this price."
1,Thought it would be much better,The book started out slow and I waited for it to improve. It got a little better but it never quite reached my expectations. The book became tedious at times repeating the same facts over and over again. I more than likely finished because I love the game of football.
1,No drawings. Sin dibujos.,This edition of The Little Prince in Spanish has no the drawings that are essential to understand and enjoy the text. It needs a warning alerting to possible buyers about that.Esta edición de El Principito en español carece de los dibujos que son esenciales para comprender y disfrutar la obra. Debería advertirse a los posibles compradores acerca de tan importante omisión.
1,No images/drawings,The core of this book should be the drawings that the little prince drow.. well they're not on the kindle edition
5,Parent of Daughter,"We know that communication is critically important and that pre-teens and teens will make better decisions with good information. But discussing subjects that most of us know little about, or find difficult to discuss, with our children is critical. This book is a must for parents, because frankly, is your child's school doing everything they should be doing? Will the teachers be around when your child needs your help? Read the book!! Get informed! And get the tools to be the best parent you can be."
5,Amazing,"A first-order comedy-drama. I am a fan of films that can manage to keep itself in one setting (""Rear Window""), one continuous time (""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?""), or both (""12 Angry Men""). ""Virginia Woolf"" takes place in actual time, and is nearly perfect. The whole, entire cast (Burton, Taylor, Dennis, Segal) all deserved Oscars. The acting was incredible. Almost rivaling ""12 Angry Men"" as being filled with amazing acting. Engrossing, poignant, hilarious . . . don't miss this movie. Do not do not do not."
5,One of the best movies ever made,One of the best movies ever made. Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor are outstanding. It has some very humorous lines even though the overall movie is rather depressing. I've watched it over and over.
5,a masterpiece,having seen this brilliant production of who's afraid of Virginia wolf i was delighted with its vibrancy and unique setting. the passion and humour was all the more worth watching. best seen when you have nothing else to intrude on your time and you give it your total dedication as only this masterpiece requires.
5,"Elegant and Brilliant, Darkly disturbing.","I'm so sick of people posting one star reviews when they just ""don't get"" a classic film. If you don't get this movie, go back to watching Will Smith and Jean-Claude Van Damme. You don't deserve to be posting comments on the board of an awe-inspiring film such as this. One of the original dark, almost noir-like films to make it big, you can't go wrong with ""Who's afraid of Virginia Wolfe."" I would rate this six stars if I could."
5,Who's afraid of virginia woolf,"This film is the equal of ""Street Car Named Desire"" How Elizabeth Taylor managed to give the performance of her liftime as an aging sexpot when she was in her thirtys is amazing...However, to me the best performance in this film belongs to Sandy Dennis. To this very day I still believe Dennis was one of the greatest female actors of all time.... Watch the way she holds her body in some of the most dramaticscenes when Taylor puts the make on her husband...I will say though, The movie can depress the hell out of you for it is so in your face with all the honesty that comes from every direction."
4,Excellent Actors!,"The movie ""Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" is about two couples, George & Martha and Honey & Nick, who meet at the house of George & Martha after a party, drink alcohol and talk about their lives. They have quarrels about nearly every theme which is mentioned.After I read the book ""Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" by Edward Albee i was very anxious for seeing the adaption.When i saw that Elizabeth Taylor an Richard Burton play the parts of the protagonists Martha and George i expected a great movie and i havn't been disappointed.The dialogues, music and facial expressions make the film a special one, which i can recommend to everyone!"
4,Lush Small-Group Arranging by Duke Pearson,"This session offers some solid ensemble playing and Duke Pearson's arranging is a perfect fit. The choice of tunes on this session is right down the middle; very inside and well-known oldies like ""Sweet and Lovely,"" ""You've Changed,"" and ""It Might As Well Be Spring, "" The ensemble backing Lou here and a few like it were used during this era to back various artists; notably a few powerful sessions fronted by Hank Mobley (A Slice of the Top) and Lee Morgan (The Procrastinator). It's a refreshing change from Lou Donaldson's usual organ groove fare. The sidemen are all A-listers, and it is amazing from the perspective of a few decades hence to think that there was a time when this concentration of talent was readily available to serve in a backup role."
5,Shocking but not never really a secret,"All these scandals are nothing new. What's new is the avalanche of victims coming out in droves. It's sad. As a Catholic I've struggled with my faith since all these victims have come forward. The Church should scrutinize prospective candidates for the priesthood and religious life, otherwise these will become 'gay professions'."
2,The church's second-worst nightmare,"This has long been a twice-told tale, nor is this the best telling. I read this book immediately after reading 'Sacrilege' by Leon Podles, and the France book clearly comes in second place by comparison. This is, after all, written by an editor from Newsweek. You can't expect such a writer to know how to write. All this gay stuff like the Stonewall riot is completely out of place in such a book. As for this being the Catholic church's worst nightmare, may I humbly point out that the church's worst-ever nightmare was the Protestant Reformation? You know, the little matter of the loss of all of northern Europe? The Catholic clergy has always been fond of boys. This has never really been a secret. The idea that we just found out about it a few decades ago is nonsense. Where have you all been, that this took you by surprise?"
4,My favorite ear-plugs,"I wear ear-plugs almost every day of the week, and have tried quite a few different brands and styles. My favorite is the Pura-Fit 6800. They are comfortable for long periods of time (over an hour) and have very good noise attenuation. Note: I wear ear-plugs within a tight fitting helment, so comfort is paramount."
3,Leiber's Tarzan,"This is a novel adapted from the Tarzan movie by Fritz Leiber. Many fans find this to be an excellent read, but I think it is way too heavy on description. The opening chapter with Tarzan in the bull ring is excellent, however, the rest of the story is plodding. Leiber researched this story to the nth degree, then put everything he had found into the story, which makes for slow slogging through the Brazilian jungles. This is Tarzan as James Bond as was the 1966 movie starring Mike Henry."
2,To much self promotion......,"When I bought the book Soros on Soros I wanted to learn how the man started his career as a speculator, and how he has maintained one of the most successful funds in the world. The first third of this book describes all the things I was looking for and the last 2/3'rds of it is all about how much money he gives away and his philosophical views. I want to know how he made money; I could care less how he gives it away. If I wanted to read about philosophy and philanthropy I sure I could have found something better than this..."
2,"If you like reading Warren Buffet, you will not like reading George Soros","I'll say this first: I am not a genius, and George Soros probably is. The book presented itself in an interesting Q&A; format that made it easy to skip around and jump sections. That being said, it was still a struggle to finish.I did not like this book because it was hard to understand and mostly discussed Soros' high-level theory on investment strategy. His theory, which Mr. Soros is very passionate about, has something to do with the universe always being out of balance. If you are a finance whiz who thrives in theoretical analysis, or if you are a new age guru curious about a billionaire's spiritual mantra, maybe you will like this book."
5,My favorite Celtic album (so far!),"I especially recommend tracks # 1, 3, 4, 7, 15, 19, 21, 23, and 25.Indeed, as some have said, many of the songs and instrumentals don't have a traditional Celtic sound. Instead, these are more ""mystical"" in feeling - moody, meditative, spiritual.My 5-star rating is for all the songs I love, not for the ones I don't like as much. Track 15 ""Fear A Bhata"" is worth the price of the album, IMO."
3,Stepfamilies are like snowflakes...,"Tolstoy said it better, but the truth is that no one book can address every step-situation. That said, this is a decent primer for the woman contemplating the plunge into stepmotherhood. I liked the practical and logistical advice, and while I understand why some might complain that the picture painted isn't as cheery as they'd like, it is, for the most part, a real picture. The chapter on ex-wives barely scratches the surface and I would recommend ""Women of Divorce"" as an apt resource on that issue. The stepmother-to-be will need all the help she can get, and this book's authors do a good job of conveying their sympathy and encouragement for the road ahead. Best advice I read was the reminder that negative reactions are more role-oritented than personal. Hold that thought, and good luck!"
1,Awful prep book,"This book is awful given its horrible and out of date questions, which are NOTHING like the real SAT II questions. Also, the history is written in a very (VERY) baised view, with almost NO soical history (35% of the SAT II should be soical history). Lastly, I am not sure if the authors are NRA members or something, but the overall sense I felt after reading the histor review was that anything liberal is bad and President Bush is the greatest president ever.Buy a better book, go for the Kaplan or the Princeton Review.P.S. I got a 790 on my SAT II US History by *not* using this book. This book might actually drag your score down!"
2,Forced myself to finish it,"I enjoy the mystery/humor/romance genre, but I had a very hard time getting into this book. In fact, I don't think I ever did. I didn't find myself caring about the characters or what happened to them. Like some others have mentioned, I felt the author was trying to cram in as many ideas as she could to make it interesting. For me, it failed."
2,I miss Ronnie so much.,"I bought this album just for the copy of Travelin' Man and a chance to here Ronnie's beautiful voice again. He truly is the greatest vocalist of all time. Unfortunatly, Johnnie can't sing half as good as him. That's not to say he's a horrible singer, but when I listen to Skynyrd, I want the sweet, smooth sound of Ronnie's voice, not the harsh, gravely sound of Johnnie's. The only song other than Travelin' Man that I listen to on this CD is Blame it on a Sad Song. It's really good, and it proves that Billy still has it. If you're a fan of the late, great Ronnie Van Zant, you own it to yourself to hear the only studio version of Travelin' Band in existence (even though Ronnie's part was sung live). But if you want to hear Ronnie at his greatest, get The Muscle Shoals Album. No one has ever sang like this since, or ever will again."
2,20 X-tra Tracks (Import) Lynyrd Skynyrd),"I feel that it was a good release, but it needs more Skynyrd style from the earlier years. I feel that Johnny could do as good as his brother if he tried. He needs to take more time into what he wants to re-do and what he wants to release. But all in all it was a fair deal. I would like to hear remakes of ""All I can do is write about it"" and ""Cheatin' Woman"". Songs like that would bring back memories for alot of fans and would be a welcome edition for the younger generation. Believe it or not, lots of my younger friends love the older Skynyrd.""Am I losing"" should also be re-done.It means alot to alot of people."
1,Painfully Bad,"This movie is useful in only one sense: It illustrates that all Criterion Collection films are not classics. This is inept at best, laughably bad in spots and sports a misogynistic streak a mile wide. Art Garfunkel is the least convincing romantic lead since Keanu Reeves--only he lacks Reeves' charisma, if you can believe it. From no camera angle is Garfunkel remotely attractive and its ludicrous that Theresa Russell would so much as give him the time of day if she weren't paid. A lot. Russell does a bit better, but the director allows her to indulge her worst acting-class instincts in spots. Keitel is just silly, pseudo German accent and all. To cap it off, in scenes where Russell's character is explored, the song ""Who Are You?"" blares over the soundtrack, completely shattering whatever film noir mood had been created.Don't waste two hours of your life on this."
5,Diamond's Beef & Meal,"Actually, I wanted to buy a different, cheaper, more pounds per sack type of dog food for my dog, but she is a picky eater and I thought I would see how she liked the Beef Meal & Rice Formula. My current dog only weighs in at 20# so she doesn't eat much and at ten years old I thought she just might need the extra energy benifits. I have not been dissapointed. Anytime she is being fed this dog food she does a little 'happy dance' that tells me she really likes this and it makes me feel good to know that she thinks I am feeding her the best there is."
3,Okay Dog Food,"This dog food is okay.. My dog seems to have an allergic reaction to the Beef flavor (even though she's never been allergic to beef products), but I switched her to the D.N. Chicken & Rice formula and she seems loads better.On the upside, her stools were smaller, firm, and less smelly. She stop having tear stains under her eyes, and she's a lot less gassy and hungry.Downside, her coat smelled horrible after eating D.N. Beef Meal and Rice, plus the skin eruptions. :/ And she wasn't too crazy about the taste.She seems to really enjoy the Chicken and Rice formula though!"
1,My dog hated it!,"After feeding my dog IAMS chicken naturals for several months, I felt that it was time for a change to what I thought was better, less manufactured dog food. It is safe to say that my dog does not like this food one bit. She will eat my friend's dog food (which is Blue Mountain brand) but will only eat the Diamond Naturals unenthusiastically after what seems like days of letting the food just sit there. I also noticed that her coat lost much of its shine and lustre over the weeks that I was feeding her this food. I understand every dog is different but my dog is a Basenji-mix and I wanted to bring this to the attention of other Basenji owners. I thought I would be getting good quality food judging by the reviews but unfortunately this was not the case. I bought Nutro Ultra instead and she eats it immediately and seems to love it! Buy at your own risk."
4,dog likes it,"My dog seems to love this dog food. When ever my mom comes to visit with her dogs, they always eat this over their own dog food! My dog has been noticeably healthier and his coat is much more shiny. Only reason its not five stars is because I can find it cheaper at the local feed store. Not that its really a bad thing for me."
4,Great dog food at a great price,"I have fed Diamond Naturals dog food for a long time. It has high quality ingredients that my dogs love. IMO, if you are feeding a dog with allergies I wouldn't use ANY beef based dog food. That is why diamond has the lamb and rice version. My dogs don't have allergies but I feel the lamb & rice has, IMO, better all around ingredients.Sharon"
5,Excellent kibble,"My dogs are doing GREAT on this product.They gobble it right up and their coats are shiney and glowing.Thank you for your prompt delivery.Can't beat the FREE SHIPPING, too!Thank you!"
3,"Seems to work, temporarily","Feliway seems to work temporarily. By the second day my aggressive cats seemed to be somewhat conked out, and slept more. That was not a bad thing. But the effect seems to wear off after a few weeks of use, I think the cats acclimate to it. That may account for the diversity of opinion as to its effectiveness.After six months without it, I'm going to try again, I'm assuming it will work for a few more weeks before they accommodate to it again."
5,Best cat calmer I've found,"I have two male cats who were picked from the same litter 13 years ago. They have always been indoors-only cats. One of the cats is significantly larger and began spraying at 3 mos, leading to neutering for both at that age, which is a bit earlier than the average. The cat who sprayed goes a bit nuts about once a month and frequently attacks his smaller brother aggressively, simulating sexual activity. Using these Feliway diffusers made a significant difference in keeping the ""bad"" cat calmer. I've been using it for at least three years and would never change. I don't use it in every room, just the areas in which he spends the most time."
3,OK,"This stuff is really expensive and didn't seem to make much of a difference for my cat. I know it's gotten a lot of great reviews, which is why I'm a little disappointed and only giving it a 3."
1,works,I am not disappointed but am unable to remove that label. I have a cat with feline hyperasthesia. My cat is on medication but can still have a hard time. This product was recommended by my veterinarian and appears to work. It is much cheaper on line than in the pet store. I will keep ordering it
1,Never Got It!,I never received this product so I cannot review. I will give the company that was supposed to send it to me a review: F!
1,Didn't do a thing,I didn't notice any differenc. The cats still fight and yowl. I put one upstairs and one down and that should cover the whole house.
1,not so great for me.,"i got this after my kitty was diagnosed with brain cancer. we were going to the vet at least once a week and, being a slightly (ok, really) agoraphobic cat, it was a very stressful time for him. i got this in the hope that it would help him to relax more quickly when we got home but it actually seemed to make him more nervous and upset. he absolutely refused to go near the room i had it in and, after a few weeks, i had to get rid of it. oh well. guess it just wasn't his kind of thing."
5,Calming Effect Noticed,Our three cats have had a stressful month with one of them suffering from a respiratory illness. He had become so fearful of going to the vet that he hid from us on the weekends and spent most of his time upstairs. I bought the Comfort Zone bottle and plugged it in the living room where they usually spend most of the day. Since plugging it in he's now sleeping cuddled on the couch with the other two. He seems to be more calm which is also helping his breathing. He's also picking on his sister less and the two of them will sleep together without the usual posturing and hissing. I can't think of anything else that has brought on this change.
4,"Diffuser works, but now I'll try the Feliway Spray","I found the diffuser in a store and thought it was quite expensive, but with two male cats (both neutered!) marking territory in my little house I was desperate to try anything. Its really hard to judge how well the product works, but I believe it helped calm down my more anxious cat and it seemed to me that spraying occurred much less. I only gave it four stars because spraying didn't stop altogether. My cats seem to mark the same places over and over, so I'm going to purchase the spray to use in those locations - fingers crossed!"
3,Works but smells like it is going to burn down our house,This stuff works and worked great for our cats. We were having some issues with spraying and clawing at the couchs and they stopped spraying and left the couches along when it was plugged in. After a while the unit smelled like it was burning and made the whole house smell. We had to unplug it for that reason. I hope its just a defective unit.
1,Disappointing,"After reading other reviews, I specifically wanted the product in the pink boxes, as shown in the picture. That is not what I received... I got the product in the blue boxes, and a couple of the boxes were tattered and beaten. I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning and refunding, so I just kept them. I would not use this vendor again."
5,High-Energy Physics Background,"This book serves as a useful reference for active high-energy physicists. The discussions, and especially calculations, cover a variety of Standard Model formalisms, which can be generalized to new physics calculations. The text by Barger and Philips,COLLIDER PHYSICS (Frontiers in Physics), is also very useful."
1,You Rascal You,"This is a waste of film. Tinto Brass probably wanted to make a tease-flick, but this is just a shame. The young lady who can't keep her skirt down flaunts her desire for sex before marriage in such a way as to embarass the viewer - especially shameful is the bar scene where she keeps displaying her crotch to a table of soldiers in order to get her boyfriend jealous. Too bad this went too far. The Italian title, ""Rascal,"" is a better fit for this one."
2,not the best or worst thing out there,"I already took the MCAT and decided to retake it. This book gives a cursory glance at important info. and sometimes completely leaves out vital concepts. The examples are a little too easy especially for the verbal section. Also, the verbal section has not been updated for the 2003 test as advertised (they have 65 ques. instead of 60). Despite this, I did like the study tips that they give, most of which you can find in the AAMC student manual. It's an ""OK"" book to have, but the MCAT is way too important for you to risk depending solely on this book."
1,What the?!!!!.........,"Is this Dokken? I know the CD cover says it is. But, maybe it's a mistake. Because it sure doesn't sound like Dokken. This is a hairband's weak attempt at grunge. ""Puppet On A String"" and ""Bitter Regret"" are the only good tunes here. Avoid this CD like the plague."
1,A waste of money,"Having enjoyed all of Dokken's previous albums, I wasted no time plunking down my money to pick up ""Shadowlife."" Big mistake. The songwriting is horrible, and the production is even worse. If you're expecting to hear the same great, catchy songs that made ""Under Lock and Key"" and ""Back for the Attack"" classics, you won't find them here. This is just plain bad."
2,It's a great grunge cd but defenetly not a dokken album,"This Album was a great disapointment for me. It has nothing to do with albums like ""Under look and key"" and ""Tooth and Nail"". ""Dysfunctional"" was still Dokken but this kind of music has nothing more to do with the music and the sound of the 80's Dokken. Dokken's last chanche:""Erase the Slate"" (I heard it's more better then Dysfunctional and Shadow life.I Always hate Grunge and i hope nothing more to hear about this music from this Band"
2,Just for the collection,"As a DOKKEN fan,I didn't need to hear it to buy it..I would've for my collection anyway. And thats exactly what it turned out to be..for my collection. I was rather disappointed w/this release... DON should've never let the producer influence the direction of the disc. He tried to hard to get DOKKEN to go the way of Soundgarden, Pearl Jam,and whatever else was happening at that moment. I have only played it a few times because it was a let down. I am very pleased that DON saw the mistakes made and corrected them w/Erase The Slate. Its so good to HEAR the return of some of the best METAL ever...and DOKKEN didn't get enough credit during the 80's which is a damn shame. Hope they continue on w/Reb at guitar"
4,George is back..for one more....,".....i can tell by his guitar licks, he isn't what he used to be. i am glad Dokken found a new sound on this effort. i only wish they kept evolving to a newer level. (seems to me erase the slate is dokken-old school). if you're a 80's fan..you probley won't like this CD. i pretty much like the whole CD. i also feel on some tracks they sound a little like the Beatles.i notice on the liner notes they look nothing like they use to. i can tell long hair or hair bandz is out dated.some of the younger alternative fanz should check this CD out."
1,I'd give it no STARS if I could,"Dokken really went down the tubes if this is what they call an ablum. I thought I was buying Dokken, all I got was a bunch of old guys trying to out grunge the young guys. Well I've got news for Dokken, leave the grunge rock to the youth and get back to your roots. That is where your sound and power is? was? whatever? Total disappointment. Anyone want to buy my copy? I'll sell it for a dollar!"
4,Great grip.,"Nice overgrip. Really good catch, don't leave your hand to glide.Little brief and almost do not fit on my Wilson [K]Factor Pro Team FX 4.3/8I think that I need to buy XL versionBut is a good grip!"
4,"Great Sound, and much of fun to listen to","For a punk band, it's not very political on most of the songs, but it's about fun. I like the sound very much, not the clean quality you hear on new discs, but thats no point for me. Eighteen tracks packed with funny/explicit lyrics. Definitely a german censorship darling. Heard this CD 100 times and it's always fun to listen to. Get it and hear for yourself. It's not my favorite CD but one of the top 20 for me... (Ah, by the way: no english on the whole CD, only german.)"
2,Unsatisfied,"Ok, the quality is about what you'd expect for a $100 lounge chair - they do look good. After a few days of Florida rain I noticed that the wood stain bled and has now ruined my nice paver deck.. now I'm pissed. I'm giving it a few days on the grass - hopefully the bleeding will stop - otherwise I'm returing it."
5,Great Value and Great Customer Sevice,"I ordered 4 chaises, 4 cushions and 4 tables and was impressed with the quality. Chaises 3x this price were no better. I was missing a few pieces of hardware but called company on a Sunday and left voicemail. Monday a.m. I received a call from them and they FedEx'd the parts that day and had them in hand 2 days later. Great job and thank you. Highly recommend these chaises and they are quite easy to put together...15 minutes per. Enjoy"
2,Tiring,"I don't know why i bouth this predictable romance book, I thought that set in England it would funny but it is not. I couldn't even finish it... although the cute teacher is described to be out of this world."
5,Justin's Best Yet,"This CD is a masterpiece, truly remarkable. It is the BEST solo yet from Justin Hayward, the lead singer from THE MOODY BLUES."
5,superb,"I bought this cd and at the same time I bought songwriter.This album is by far the better of the two. It is gorgeous,and like wine, Justin has mellowed and improved with age.The two killer songs on this cd are 'Broken Dream' and thebeautiful but lyrically unusual 'Billy' The rest of the songson this cd are much stronger then those on 'songwriter', but it is to be expected - he's had about 25 years more experience between albums.It makes me wonder why people would buy this cd if they didn't know the Moody Blues, and if they do know the moody's music, how could one possibly give this a low rating? If you are into rap, boy bands or whatever britney etc are, then this obviously isn't for you."
3,years covered,this book may be fine if you have a pre 1966 modelnothing here says what years it covers
2,Mercedex Benz S420 repair manual,This book was not what one would expect by description. It is complicated and not specific to the S420 as described. This book is geered more for a top mechanic or a automobile builder who would have a vast amount of knowledge about cars. It is not for the average person wanting to know about their car. I got the book and sent it right back with the hour as it was not for me and did not tell me nothing for my S420.
3,Wrinkle around the colllar,I bought these for a two week trip to Europe. They saved a ton of space over traditional cotton tees. They were easy to wash in a sink and came relatively clean (nothing like machine washing though). The downsides are: (1) they trap body heat initially and it was very warm when you first put them on. (2) The collar wrinkles and looks bad.
4,A war movie on a personal level,Good movie; I'm always amazed by the simple raw effects of the Korean cinema unlike the heavily computerized one of Hollywood.This movie is about the people who suffer from the war and how their hopes are destroyed in a single turn of events.It shows that war can bring the best and the worst in a person.I recommend this movie if you are a fan of non mainstream movies.
3,"Decent Blu Ray - Nice video, good sound but NO FEATURES","Great film about the Korean War from Korea's perspective. The battle scenes are expertly done, and although the film can be a bit melodramatic in spots, I feel it is still the seminal film about ""The Forgotten War."" My only complaint about the Blu-ray is the lack of special features that were available on the standard def DVD. Whats up with that?"
5,Cinema done right,"After a few years of disappointing Asian movies, this movie gets it right. This Korean film, Tae Guk Gi, tells a story of two brothers thrust into a war they care little about. Over time one embraces the brutality of war, while the other fights against it. In the name of love the warrior fights brutally. But, in the movie's central point, this brutality overcomes good intentions. The other brother must wage his own war against the depravity of war that is destroying his brother.The last few years have seen an influx of Asian movies hit the scene here in the States. Most have been disappointing and most get lost in their own beauty. Tae Guk Gi is very beautiful and its imagery is amazing. But the story keeps true to its theme. This is well worth the time, and is a gripping portrait of war."
5,Very Important! do not watch this movie without reading this:,"DO NOT watch this movie in English dubbing. It is absolutely horrible voice acting. The emotion coming from the Korean actors on screen is what you want to hear in their voices and their tones. I do not understand Korean, so I watch with English sub-titles.The first time I watched this movie, I watched it for about 15 minutes with English dubbing so I wouldn't have to watch the screen AND the sub-titles, but it was so bad we had to turn it off. Then we switched to sub-titles, and it was like an entirely different movie. You can really appreciate this movie better by using English sub-titles instead of dubs."
5,HAWAIIAN DELIGHT,"I had to add my two cents. This product was offered at a home we rented in Hawaii and was the ""icing on the cake"" of this tropical paradise. I had to have some for home! It smells divine and works beautifully!"
3,Just Average!,This shower gel only deserves an average rating! I decided to splurge on an expensive shower gel because I have heard so much about philosophy products. I am very disappointed and will buy my shower gel from Wal-Mart from now on. The scent was so very slight I cannot even tell it is coconut. The gel does not lather as well as the Wal-Mart brand that I am used to. I do not think this is worth the high price they ask for it.
1,A lousy cassette adapter,"I have an old car and cassette adapter is the bridge between the car and my ipod. When I first attempted using this, there was no sound at all even though my iPod volume was at 75 percent and my car audio volume was normal. After several attempts I found out that I had to max out both the car audio and my ipod to full volume to hear anything.My previous cassette adapter had no such problems.The trouble with setting the car audio high is that if one wishes to quickly hear the radio for traffic or weather updates, one has to turn down the volume considerably prior to switching to radio or risk a pounding of the auditory nerves.I wish I can return this, but the return postage and hassles are not worth it.Not good.Avoid."
4,Better than any wireless (FM) gear I've tried,"I bought this cassette adapter for my wife's car. My only expectation (or hope) was that it would sound as good as the CD player in her car (1997 Mazda Protege w/stock ""premium"" audio package). To my pleasant surprise, it did. It does seem kind of nuts that a $10 adapter would sound better than the wireless (FM) systems I've tried as they tend to cost a few times more. Anyway, now my wife can enjoy and get some use out of her MP3 player in the car too. I can't speak to its longevity yet, we'll have to wait and see on that point. Though I had my doubts, as far as sound quality, this is definitely a solid choice."
2,Spend $3 more and get the Sony,"I bought this Belkin and one made by Sony for $13. The sound quality on the Sony is like a cd and this one sounds like a cassette, thats how much better the Sony is. Spend a few more dollars on the Sony model."
2,Didn't work.,"I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and it didn't work on his car. I'm not sure if it was the product or his radio. However, he has had no luck with these cassette adapters so I'm going to try it on my mom's car and see if it works. If it works ill come back and leave another review.."
3,"Works for some cars, not for all","Didn't work in my 1996 Ford Taurus. I had to buy an adapter from a different brand. Not sure if it works, as I couldn't get it to work. Car stereo just spits it out.Solid construction, and the wire is great quality. Not a bad item, just didn't work for me."
1,Not the real Jenson tape adapter. Total ripoff,"I received a cheap off brand instead ofthr Jensen it's advertised under. The sound quality was bad and I had to go and buy another one anyway, because it did not utilize both of my car speakers. Waste of $8"
2,Auto-Reverse Is Still a Problem,"I drive a Ford Escort. I'm not entirely sure what year it is, but I know it's from the late '90s. I bought this product because of the reviews that said it works fine with cars that have the auto-reverse feature. This is not the case for me, though this does work better than the Sony adapter I had that would stay on side one for a maximum of ten seconds before switching to side two and staying there. With this adapter, it's kind of a crap shoot. Sometimes it will reverse several times during one song and sometimes it will reverse once every few songs. On the plus side, this one at least switches back to side one on its own. So it's not intolerable, but it's annoying."
1,"good delivery, bad product.",The cassette worked okay for a couple of days and then the music went distorted. Put the old one back in and it works fine. I guess you get what you pay for.
3,Lot of background hum,"The price was right for this but in the end I wish I had bought something else. In my Toyota deck, I get a lot of background hum while listening to podcasts. I find myself messing with the Treble to try and improve the voice quality.This lasted 16 months from purchase to broken wire - but I used it daily."
3,"""ALICE IN WONDERLAND MEETS KAFKA""","Jean-Luc Godard is perhaps best known as the most influential of the French New Wave filmmakers. Themes of social realism were wedded to a naturalistic, seemingly spontaneous, hand-held cinematography with jump cuts and an intimate documentary style.1964's BAND OF OUTSIDERS has been described by Godard as ""Alice in Wonderland meets Franz Kafka."" This sentimental, noirish story is about a gullible woman who takes up with couple of would-be bad guys in an ill-fated effort to rob her own home of her aunt's fortune. (The primary relationship in the story may have been the inspiration behind the recent, overlooked and very funny, Bandits.)Band of Outsiders is weirdly joyous and always surprising with a sense of romantic doom that recalls his most famous gangster romance, Breathless (A Bout de Souffle, 1959)."
2,Not the best with little zest.,The Cat Ate my Gymsuit wasn't a very good book. This book didn't have a very good flow and it was very choppy. There was not enough info on who the characters were and what they were doing. It was boring with no adventure or energy. It didn't keep my attention and people can't make any connections. It doesn't go very indepth with the main character and it doesn't tell you much about the people that are mentioned. You shouldn't judge this book by its cover or title because they have nothing to do with the book. The father verbally abuses the family and that makes this a book not recommended for elementary age students. Some good points about this book were that it was an easy read and if you have time on your hands its something to read. Some people may be able to relate. This book has an unexpected ending even though it's not exciting.
2,Is it a mystery? or a Romance?,"Don't get me wrong. I love a good light-hearted mystery and/or a romance with a little suspense thrown in, but not in the same book. About halfway through the mystery got lost and the romance took over. By the end, I really couldn't have cared less about who had done it and why. The characters also seemed too one-dimensional. Angie is sterotypically young, beautiful, and rich. She also has a fabulous career. Paavo was drawn slightly deeper, but still the sterotype of a dark, brooding cop who has a past remained. I have not read the additional books in the series, but from this first one, I probably will not. The premise is intriguing, and heaven knows, any addition to genre is appreciated. I enjoyed it only when I realized it was more of a romance than a mystery."
1,a real disappointment,"I love mysteries combined with romance, so when a romance started to develop I eagerly read on. However, Pence goes way overboard, laying it on so thick that you think you're reading a Harlequin Romance. Added to that, the heroine--since there's no way you can call her a detective, even an amateur one--continually gets herself and others into hot water through her sheer stupidity. She also has few positive characteristics, not someone I could relate to or see as a role model; she's just a nice, stupid girl without any common sense. This book was just plain irritating. I'm definitely not going to order any more Angie Amalfi mysteries."
1,SCAM!!!,"This is NOT twelve individual 7-oz packages of Snausages, but ONE 12-oz package! Complete scam! I can get them in the store much cheaper!!!"
1,No paint or red tail,I bought this for my son because he wanted a red tail plane. This set did nothave a decal or red paint as the picture showed. Thus this was not a red tail. Alsothere was no green paint for the ground vehicle. It took my son 6 hours to put it together.He enjoyed putting it together~this is the only positive thing.
2,oh my GOD.,"Before I say anything about this product, I would like to warn you that it smells. I can't necessarily describe the smell, but go on other websites, read reviews. It really really smells. Which makes it really hard to keep on your face for 5-10 minutes.Other than the traumatizing smell, the product seems to work, although I'm not quite sure. After washing off the medicine, my face was smooth but it felt very dry and unpleasant.I'm a huge Neutrogena fan, but I hate this product."
4,SURPRISING,"This album is good and surprising to be a first album. I did not expect it to be so hot. AT firs I was not going to buy, and against my wishes my friend played it and I was like WHAT! So I had to cop it for myself.Some of her more r and b music reminds me of Beyonce (highly overrated and too simple) but better. It way more deep."
1,Lets See The Facts,"turn on your TV to WPopTV aka PopTV and see that Ciara is a 1-hit-wonder for ""goodies."" once I knew that she and other untalented cheeseheads were on the 1-hit-wonder special, I became to like really the channel!ciara is just another 1-hit-wonder has been!she had 1 hit--""Goodies"" and when no one wanted her sorry untalented a(...), she became a kiddie star!"
2,"Sorry, Ciara.","First, I'd like to point out that I'm not a kid; my browser won't take me to the register page for some reason. Anyways, I don't think Ciara is that great of a singer. She has a limited range..nothing powerful at all. Everytime I hear that ""you think you're slick"" part from Goodies, I just cringe. I heard most of the songs on this album. Lyrically, they're not good, just mediocre at best. Especially in Hotline..""you're the cutest thing."" Sounds like something you'd say to a puppy. And I agree with MissCuteness (a couple of reviews below me), Aaliyah was the first to do this crunk n b. Anyways, I wouldn't recommend this album if you're looking for some inspired lyrics."
3,"Ciara Delivers the ""Goodies,"" but in Limited Amounts.","The title song of Ciara's debut is not only the ultimate party anthem of the summer, but it's one of the best singles of the year. This jam has been Number One for over a month, and not without good reason: an infectious chorus, a crunked up groove, and production from Lil' Jon (who did Usher's ""Yeah!""), currently one of the hottest producers in hip hop. Sadly, you're not going to find anything else on ""Goodies"" that will top that single. Tracks like ""1, 2 Step"" and ""Thug Style"" are obvious fillers, though others like ""Pick Up the Phone"" and ""Lookin' at You"" are decent, if unspectacular, slices of hip hop flavored r&b. But the better cuts are the R. Kelly-penned ballad ""Next to You"" and ""Ooh Baby"" which are memorable and make the best use of Ciara's limited vocal range. Beyond the red-hot title song, ""Goodies"" is standard, radio-friendly r&b with a few nice touches. On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it a 6. It's flawed, but Ciara has some promise."
4,Ciara!!,"Ciara is cool she has a nice album expet the song called 1,2 step I hate that song because I had a problem with this song at my shcool. About ciara and Bow Wow, I think they make a cute couple, but I think Bow is too short for Ciara."
1,Just be yourself/Throw the wig away,"I think the album is bad, but I think she has the talent to take her long way in the future.I think she will look much better if she start showing her natural hair and looks. She has tried too hard to look and sing like Beyonce (Which is understandable, she is going to have a lot of influence on new up and coming artists). She needs to be herself. None of the song really catch you except ""one, two step"" even after trying for a couple of times. Title song is very disappointing. Lyrics are just as bad on most tracks.Please don't buy it, save your cash!"
2,"""Good""ies ain't that Good.","The higlight of the album has to be the slick production on several tracks, that save the record from fizzling completely. ok yeah so it spawned 3 massive hits: ""Goodies"" with Petey Pablo (#1 Billboard Hot 100), my favorite - ""1,2 Step"" with Missy Elliott (#2) and my second favorite - the highly sexy ""oh"" with Ludacris (#2)! But thats about it. Everything else on the album plain sucks. Ciara is a highly limited artist who can barely sing..... they should've included her current hits ""Lose Control"" with Missy & Fatman Scoop , and ""Like You"" with Bow Wow on a special edition of this CD. Its not entirley untrue when I say that this record is lacklustre and insubstantial. Like it or not: Ciara is no Aaliyah or Monica or even Tweet for that matter. Buy it at your own risk."
3,"Some Good,Some Not","""Goodies"" by Ciara is a fresh song that was released to catch the ears of the listeners. In my opinion all the best songs on the disc feature another artist (""Goodies"" w/Petey Pablo, ""1,2 Step"" w/ Missy Elliot, & ""Oh"" w/Ludacris). The best song on the album is ""Oh"". Ciara isn't trying too hard to sing or impress, she is letting the words come out naturally. The beat is intense and the song is hard. ""Hotline"" is a pretty good song, but the only standout tracks are the ones she released as singles. Her debut shows that she will be only get better with time."
3,Some good songs,"Dancing songs like ""Goodies"", ""Oh"", ""Pick Up The Phone"", ""Lookin' At You"" and ""Hotline"" are great, but I think the slower songs are not original.The girl has not a great voice, the CD is repetitive, it's a little boring."
2,don't be fooled by this janet jackson wannabe,"so she had 2 dance hits, but she can't even dance as good as janet jackson yet she copies her videos and dance moves and all these little kids are falling for it. What a damn shame."
3,She is fine and has some great goodies!,The album was coo in a way. I mean the song goodies is old but the one she did with Ludacris was off the chain. I mean she does have a career but she needs to step out of the crunk RnB and try some real RnB I know she aint live life yet but she will be kinda like a Southern version of Christina Milian!!!
1,Dont buy,im really a sucker for eevrything i like every lil crappy music around but ciara goodies was ok 1 2 step rocked but she stopped wit OOH............She danced her way into the music industry but leave it to me she would dance her A** out of it!!!!!! she sucks and no doubt about it....i wasted money that couldve gone toa good cause to buy her cd and i regert it until this day.. it go tme so mad that i broke it in half...... her dance moves which i dont fink she does it all wit herslef is ok but her singing gosh her vocals jus doesnt do any work.. an amateur like me would rock ur world if u liked her singing..Go check someone out worth checking out likealicia keysKeyshia coleKelly clarksonthese have a special voice to brag bout and dont come out fake.!!
3,"Love the beats, not her voice","Ciara's debut album is not that bad. She beings that down south favor to the table with ""1,2 Steps"" that's in my opinion would have been the first single coming off her album. But overall her song with Ludacris and R.Kelly is the bomb. She may need to go vocal class but Jazze Pha really put it down with the beats for her (maybe cause of her lack of singing, hmm). Anyways though, not a bad CD, needless to say."
5,KRUNK-TASTIC,"Ciara's cd ""Goodies"" is an all around party album. To start off with her single goodies was a great party song. It has a great beat and just makes you want to dance. Her second single ""1,2, Step"" was a hit off the top also. Again it is aparty song. Along with many other songs on the album, it is a fun cd to listen to with friends and loved ones. SHe also has songs for some of you out there who are in love and like those slow songs too. So the only way that I can get my point acroos to you, is if you go out and buy the cd. I rate the entire cd 5 STARS"
4,1st Lady of Crunk & B,"I was surprised by this album. I loved her 1st single ""Goodies"" but I had already figured her as one-hit-wonder, but after listening to this CD, I think I was wrong. This CD, although has some flaws (lyrics, vocal performances), is pretty good. Ciara's debut is filled with upbeat 'crunk', ""Goodies""-like dance tracks, some of my favourite include ""1, 2 Step (ft. Missy Elliott)"" and ""Oh (ft. Ludacris)"". So if you're into that whole Lil' Jon 'crunk' style and, of course R&B then you should listen to this CD."
4,Ciaras Goodies Ends Up With 3 Stars,"Ciara delivered the Goodies when she released ""GOODIES"" the single, that song was hot, then she released ""1,2 Step"" it proved to be even better, so I decided to finally get her album after months of pondering around it after I heared ""Oh"", the album started off great, right after ""Oh"" unfortunatley is when the music starts to go slow jammy and bleh. Im not saying its completely bad, its just a tad boring and a tad listenable.But the first 5 tracks are standouts, its weird how the album ends on such a high note, ""Goodies"" remix, and before that its slow music heaven. Im not sure if I really think this album is great or not, but I think 3 stars is fine for Ciara, who has alot of time to find her sound, unforunatley its not fully complete with ""Goodies"" the album.KEY TRACKS:Goodies1,2 StepThug StyleOhHotlineNext To YouAnd IGoodies Remix"
3,Pretty good...but not good enough!!,"For this to be Ciara's debut album it is not good enough, and she will most likely be a one hit wonder. The only good songs on the album are 1,2 step...hotline...and next to you. She has the beats but not the vocals. Hopefully she will have a vocal coach work with her for the next album...If she gets to make another one!!"
5,Goodies,"I bought this album the day it came out. I love this CD and it is off the chain. Her debut is heaping dose of real life issues conveyed through everyday language and extraordinary production and vocal delivery. The album is a complete work of art and a masterful mixture of messages for the young and not so young. She is dubbed ""The First Lady of Crunk & B"". This album has been certified 2x Platinum. REmember,this was 2004-2005."
1,....Why do so many people like this?,"""Goodies"" isn't that great....the whole song is like one note....it isn't catchy.....it's a total ripoff of and yet is nowhere near as good as ""Freek-A-Leek""......and that beeping techno sound in the background is unbearably aggravating, my eardrums start bleeding if I listen to it too long. ""1, 2 Step"" is the only halfway decent song here. There is nothing innovating at all other than that, it's all mindless filler. And this girl can't sing. What's the point in buying this....? Just the same old crap."
1,at least....,"AT LEAST JANET JACKSON IS A SONGWRITER/PRODUCER/MUSIC ARRANGER/ETC. CIARA IS A UNTALENTED 1-HIT-WONDER WHO DOES NONE OF THEM. SHE BARELY CO-WRITES AND SEEING ALL THE NAMES FOR 1 SONG, ITS PROBABLY 2 LINES THAT GET OVERRRATED. SHE IS AN UNTALETNED 1-HIT-WONDER KIDDIE STAR THAT FLOPPED AND HER 15 MINUTES ARE SO OVER! THE ALBUM SUCKED AND FLOP! GOODBYE CIARA...FINALLY!!"
1,Oh Goodness,Horriable singing + limited dancing ability + 4th grade lyrics + Generic music = Ciara.Her Goodies need to be thrown away.
3,31/2 stars courtesy of nice dance beats,Ciara has a pretty desent album. I'm sorry to disappoint ciara fans but the biggest and only problem with her is the fact that she CAN'T SING! I'm sorry but home girl just cannot hold a note. I am a fan of female r&b and she just ain't cuttin' it. Chicks like alicia keys and amerie vocally kicks her out the door. But if u just want 2 cut a rug and shake what ur momma gave ya then this is it. I just wish she could sing though. Oh well I guess u can't have ur cake and eat it too :-(
2,Oooh how horrible.,"Ciara's album is a total waste, the first five songs are good(the one's that will be her single)the rest of the Album sucked. don't waste your money. Ciara can't sing in live she's more of a dancer. [...]"
1,Buyer beware !!!,"Although this item claims to be ""toons"" it is actually a complitation of ""animations"" by independant artists in the 70's- BIG DIFFRENCE- there were only a few real ""toons"" on this tape - the rest were a mix of media - clay,drawing, etc. Mostly a bunch of animated drawings swirling and flashing into shapes of genitalia- not worth the money folks!"
1,not this one,"Tried several different brands/types. This one was among those that failed - had air leaks more than once, even while brand new. Discarded."
3,Not Impressed,"I decided to step up to the ATH-A700 from a $15 pair of Sony's and I have to say that I'm not impressed. I was hoping to put them on and be pleased, but I wasn't. I wanted to say NICE! But I couldn't.I think that the sound quality is good overall and I am very happy with the level of comfort. I also like the cord length as well.I think they are decent in blocking surrounding noise, but only in the higher ranges. As another has noted, the lows are definitely more noticeable and can draw your attention away from the track. I will however qualify this by saying that I'm in close proximity of constant noise and have learned to tune it out. If I had the ability to try them before hand, I probably would have saved my money."
1,Are you kidding me?,"I cannot believe that I can spend a pretty good chunk of change and get a set of headphones that sound worse than a $[...] pair from [...]! Why are these companies building garbage?! This is without a doubt the biggest disappointment. The sound was unbelievably weak and distorted. What are the people in these reviews listening to that they like so much?! You guys must be out of your mind if you think that these things sound great. OMG! I had them plugged in for an astounding 30 seconds before I decided they were going back. This is the second set of headphones I have tried through Amazon. Amazon has been great, unfortunately its the products that have [...] and I can't afford to keep paying shipping so I am going to just go to my local store and even though it will cost more to buy a set of headphones there, at least I can return them quickly if I don't like them."
4,Not Comfortable When You Have Your Glasses On.,The 3D wing design is really great. But I have to point out it's really uncomfortable if you have your glasses on your head. But the BOSE Noise-Cancelling one doesn't have this problem. I don't know how they did that. The sound quality is great. Can be driven by ipod Nano.
1,TERRIBLE! DO NOT BUY- Surprised it isn't recalled yet!,"I purchased this new, for my daughter's first toddler bed. WHAT A MISTAKE!! The inflatable mattress doesn't fit snugly into the bed, so there are HUGE gaps on the sides, which I had to roll up blankets and stuff pillows around it, so my daughter wouldn't get stuck in between the sides & mattress, and suffocate!! Then, about a month after having it, the mattress got a hole that I could not find, so I replaced it with a cot, thinner, mattress. No fear of my daughter getting stuck anymore, but HOW uncomfortable!! Then, the 'foot board' soon got a hole and deflated.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! BAD, BAD, BAD!!"
2,GANGSTA RELIC,"mc rens raps on the nwa albums were powerful and fresh. on his solo debut, 92s EP ""kiss my black ass"", he combined brutal raps with bone crushing beats to create a classic album.his follow up full length albums were commercially disappointing, but musically solid. 93s ""shock of the hour"" had funky beats and political raps, whereas 96s ""villain in black"" was a more aggressive, dark and ominous sound. both albums proved ren was still one of the best and most exciting MCs on the west coast.this 98 effort however, features low budget production and sloppy flows. the lyrics and beats are so diluted compared to his previous work. ren sounds like a washed up and uninspired MC desperately trying to make a hit record, with very poorly chosen producers and guests. the result is a terrible album."
1,SKIP THIS CD!! Guitar playing sounds terrible!,This CD is very amateurish. CD sounds like a bad 80's band. The lyrics are childish and the guitar playing sounds like someone learning how to play. I am pretty sure that this band lost their recording contract after they released this album.
3,"Visually Stunning, Stallone Shines","Add one part Sly Stallone, one part Mickey Rourke, and small slivers of Miranda Richardson, Rachel Leigh Cook, and the marvelous Michael Caine and the end result is: a cast that almost rises above the basically plotless script.The cast is great, the camerawork is excellent, the feel of the movie is there, but somehow we are missing a bit of heart.The internet porn angle is kind of original I guess, and the scenes between Cook and Stallone are touching, but this film has some missing element that I can't put my finger on.The biggest problem I had with this entertaining film is that there is no real morality here. It's all about revenge. Kind of cold."
4,who doesn't love a good revenge story?!,"I mean seriously, who doesn't love a good revenge story?! I admit, I'm a sucker for Stallone, but I love this movie, and I'm not even a big action movie fan. You can't help but root for Stallones' character in this one. I think it's a highly underappreciated movie."
2,It's all about the next level.,"A slow, dreary film so poorly lit several scenes exist in half darkness. Especially funny is a scene where one character asks another to take off his glasses -- you know, so he can see his eyes -- and we can't see his eyes! Too rich.Stallone is Carter, a Vegas hitman out to avenge the death of a brother and the abuse of a niece. Caine's a goon, Rourke's a goon, Cook's the sexually abused niece and Cumming's just weird.Stallone talks endlessly of taking the tough-guy standoffs ""to the next level;"" only Rourke is allowed to respond with his own level, after which Stallone returns with a level not seen since the final duel in ""Cobra."""
2,A film where the plot was secondary to the action,"""Get Carter"" is a remake of the Micheal Caine ""Get Carter"". I think the biggest problem with ""Get Carter"" is that it focused on more of the action then the plot.""Get Carter"" is about Jack Carter (Sylvester Stallone) returning home to pay his respects to his brother who died. While home, Jack discovers that his brother may not have died due to drunk driving. This triggers a full investigation. (Stallone style)""Get Carter"" has a good plot, but I think because Stallone was the star of the film, there was a need to focus on action and by doing this, the plot was secondary.If you are the kind of person who enjoys a movie that focuses on the action while the plot fades away, you will enjoy this film."
2,Terrible for Beginners or low-Intermediates,"While this book seems to have everything, it is laid out for someone who knows every term for everything. If you don't come knowing everything about HTML, CSS, XML, etc., forget it. There are far fewer hands-on sections, walk-throughs or advice than the other excellent Real World books. This book is devoted to telling you in great detail how to use the software with what you already know. I'm no slouch with HTML and have used Dreamweaver 3, but this book will leave many of us in the dust. Buried in the intro, the authors tell you that if you're a beginner, start elsewhere."
4,You Won't Beleive Your Eyes,"You will think that this was photoshopped, airbrushed, other otherwise tricked up. It's not. These are simple, real photgraphs of dancers that are hard to believe as real.Modern dance is something not everyone understands. This collection will make you wonder how it is that human beings can create such kinetic sculpture with their bodies and some pieces of cloth."
5,Extremely awesome!!,"This may be the best Sweet Valley Twins book ever written! What I liked the best about it was how the author threw you off when Elizabeth made an embarrassing accusation. It was really funny how Amy, Elizabeth and Maria had to act clumsy for their parents to enroll them in Charm School so they could solve the mystery. It was so hilarious what they did just to get in, even when they didn't want to! For more details, read the book. You won't regret it. This -if not the best book- is the best mystery that Francine Pascal has ever written."
5,Great buy for the money!,"I love this comforter set. Compared to others, it is less expensive but at the same time has everything you will need and is so adorable. Has both colors for either a girl or boy which is great for us since we still do not know what we are having. The size chart that comes with it is so cute and the mobile even cuter. I can not recommend this product enough. It is worth every penny! Hope this helps."
5,Simple. Elegant. Affordable.,Simple and elegant. The milgrain edge adds a touch of sophistication and the half round band gives the ring more interest compared to flat milgrain bands. It's also wears very comfortably on the finger. The price is great for a 14K gold band. Only wished it had more size and material(like 18K or platinum) options. But overall a great classic wedding band.
5,Do You Head A Huge Favor!,"Are you kidding me? This album is absolutely fabulous and stands totally gleaming on its own merits. Why even bother comparing blue to purple, ice cream to cake, skydiving to bungee jumping, surfing to skiing...it is ALL so completely wonderful. Sure, you have to shift gears slightly and adjust your headphones a bit and maybe ease a bit further down into your seat but this is without questions, one of the most enjoyable trips you can take without leaving your chair. Try falling asleep while listening to this...I can't do it...hard to sleep while your toes are tapping and your body is floating through space...rock, latin beats, hypnotic harmonies, awesome ivories and more. What has happened to music these days? It is so sad.... well...gotta go....time to fly! Enjoy!"
1,Once WAS upon a time.........,"35 years ago greezy was hip.........now this ""Hiphop"" is cynical, biting, and without musical substance. I don't like it at all. The summer song was played maybe twice on KUT...in the ""top ten"" for about 2 weeks and then it disappeared. So many really great songs have come out.....buy John Fogarty or Steve Earle---extremely brilliant writing and music without this rebel without a clue undertone. As far as Geezers--They're angry, they're cynical, they're OLD. Reviewers here feel the need to drop names about who thinks this CD is hip and attack others who don't like it---I've got an opinion of my own."
1,HipNOT,"Know when to call it OVER. I bought this because I believed this was a re-incarnation of the soulful group from yesteryear-not so. This is filler at its worst. Sweet Mary's strings are still sweet, but that is where the sound begins and ends. I started screaming wait wait to the painful harmonies with no bottom to it. Lyrics were infantile, background ""choir"" made me think of an anglican church chorus. I'm throwing this out and going back to the vinyl....please STOP---you're tarnishing your own name with these new non-greezer studio chumps."
2,2.5 stars,"Weak. Neither of the Sinclair cousins are present here.The songwriting is MOR. Nothing new, nothing exciting, nothing interesting either. Give this a pass and stick with In The Land Of Grey And Pink, Waterloo Lily, If I Could Do It All Over Again I'd Do It All Over You or even, For Girls Who Grow Plump In The Night....Simon"
4,Interesting Book,"These are the complete works of Enoch for half the price under the Enoch titles. I have compared them and this book is the translation, WORD FOR WORD, of other Enoch Titles for half the price. After reading this book, I wondered just how much of the 2 old religions had stolen from Enoch and credited to someone else? This author even showed how much Jesus had took from Enoch as his own. Is it all true? Makes you wonder. A good read whatever the case."
3,Quite interesting,"Filled with interesting materials and ideas, however the author's writing style puts me right to sleep. A great writer can turn even the act of watching paint dry on the wall into a remarkable journey. Those authors that wrote Holy Blood Holy Grail should've written this book instead."
3,Not necessary if you buy the book of enoch,This book is basically a commentary with the book of enoch after it. It's better to just by the book of enoch by itself.
1,Dr King,"Fallen Angels is nothing but a preface to the Book of Enoch. Just buy the Book of Enoch and save the money, except if you like non-fiction."
5,bible study,An interesting read. A must have for book collectors of religion. It really gets you thinking.
4,"Enoch, Si, Prophet, no!","I read this along with several of the Apocryphal and Pseudopigriphal books of the Bible when I studied religion in college a few years ago. The original book of Enoch and the Secrets of Enoch (a.k.a. Enoch II) are quite interesting and revelaing. The story of the Fallen angels in the Book of Enoch makes a good read, as well as the story of Enoch's expereinces in heaven in ""The Secrets of Enoch"" and the sayings from both books that are scattered throughout the current Bible. (To the good Christians who aren't in the know about the roots of Christianity, ask your pastors why they never told you about this stuff).But as for Elizabeth Claire Prophet's analysis of all of this, that's strictly for the cuckoo patch, especially the absurd songs to Enoch."
2,Not Happy,"I purchased this book used in the fall of 2011. When it arrived it was bent in half. (hard cover) I didn't think much about it as it was still totally usable and was used. I just submitted it back in the ""Buy back program"" and it was rejected. Value: $93. Becareful what you buy in the used book category."
4,Great acting By Vic Morrow,"If there was an actor who play a non-com better than any other actor , other than John Wayne, It would have to be Vic Morrow. He made his character beleivable and he made his notch in the profession."
4,Good Strap,"I bought this for my Nikon D300s, which is quite a heavy camera body. I haven't used it much, but I spent the weekend in Washington DC sightseeing, so I had the camera around my neck quite a bit. I found the strap to be stable and comfortable, can't ask for much more from a camera strap."
4,The best only gets better...,"This is one of the best books; I loved it. I originally purchased this as a gift for my husband because I thought he would be interested in the historical value of this fictional account. My husband had not read fiction since he was a child and upon reading this title, he was thrilled! For me, the book was one I didn't want to put down and then again, I tried to read it slowly so as to savor every word. The author has cleverly integrated another era, military life and an unusual means of warfare into characters and words.Buy the book, read the book, love the book."
3,IT'S NOT THE BOOK THE MOVIE WAS BASED ON!!!,"It's not bad, but not what I was looking for. I wanted the book the movie was made from- David Mitchell"
5,The Answer for Me,Short and sweet...this answers the mail for me...have been looking for something like this for months.
4,Off the starting blocks,"This is the clearest book I have read on this issue - and I have read a lot of them. When is the sequel, for when it comes out I'll give it five stars if it expands the checklists for, in particular, family emergencies."
4,good book,This book has a lot of good info in it as well as references. Almost exactly what I was looking for.
5,Review - Philips DVP 5140,"Very nice unit. Works as advertised, plays all my wife's SE Asia VCDs. It even worked well with regular DvDs. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a versatile DVD/CD player."
3,"YES, this is multi regional even if Philips says no","Thanks to Gavin R. Jewell ""BigHairyScaryMonster"" who linked us to H.A Emet review. We couldn't play our European DVDs on this machine. We called Philips who told us (two different reps) they don't make multiregional machines. Searched the comments and found the way to make it multiregional. Thank YOU!! It works now. Can't wait to finally watch my DVDs.This is what H.A. Emet wrote for all of you in the same predicament that I was in.To make it region code free follow these instruction:1. Turn on the unit2. Open the loading tray3. Press the ""Setup"" button on the remote4. Navigate to the ""Preferences"" page using the right arrow key6. Press the down arrow once to enter the Preference page5. Enter 138931 on the remote6. You will now see the current region code displayed7. Use the Up/Down arrow keys to select the region required or ""0"" for all regions8. Press the ""Play"" button on the remoteHappy watching."
5,"Thoughtful, Direct, Very Helpful, esp. for Busy People","I found this CD perfect for short spells of mediation--I'm always trying to talk myself out of it--and being able to do a 15 minute meditation compared to some of the longer ones available, has actually got me started meditating! I've read some of the other reviews and it seems like the complaints they have are about meditation in general--you really are just focusing on your breath, I mean not to be a nudge but they seemed like problems people have with meditation in general. There aren't a lot of bells and whistles here , maybe that was the concern--it is very direct, no music, etc. In any case I found this to be completely helpful and a great start to my meditation practice."
4,Somewhat helpful,"Rivka Simmons' voice is very soothing and encouraging, but her ""meditations"" have been only so-so helpful in easing my ""stress"". Track 4, ""Body Scan Relaxation"" continues to leave me baffled. (*How* am I supposed to ""breathe"" from my feet?) Track 3, ""Progressive Muscle Relaxation"" has been more helpful."
3,SoSo,"Not as good as the first book, this one is just soso in qualityParticularly grating is the main character Cassandra's self righteous hypocrisy, which really brings the book down for meAll in all not bad but I wouldn't really recommend it"
2,Not Her Best,"I think the only enjoyment I got out of reading this book was that it took place in South Florida.The characters were pretty flat and there wasn't much to like about them. But the biggest disappointment was that unlike Ms. Sawyer's other books, the identity of the murderer was easily figured out despite the lame attempts at trying to make you suspect others. A definite disappointment from an author I usually enjoy a lot."
1,TRUE Vegetarian? Either you are or you aren't.,Returned this book the day I received it; to call it a vegetarian cookbook is false advertising.
4,"Mahler Symphony #4, Hidemaro Konoye, 1930","I bought my copy of this recording many years ago while perusing the Mahler section of recordings at the now defunct Tower Records. Being recorded on May 28/29, 1930, it is of course a monorual recording. This first electrical recording (as opposed to acostical)of Mahler has been remastered and is mostly quite free of the cliks and bumps one might expect. I give it four stars only because it is not up to current standards ... but after one listens to it for a few minutes it can be thought that this was recorded only a few years ago rather than eight decades. A must for collectors of historic fine classical music. It is a landmark gem!"
5,Another top-notch job,"I have used the Standard Lesson Commentary for the past three years, and I have always found it to be an excellent resource. This issue is another top-notch job. Lessons are explained well, and excellent background discussion is provided. Plans for alternate teaching methods are included and these provide very good exercises. A superb work."
4,I think this fixed my cat's bathroom issues,"My cat had constipation and sometimes diarrhea. I didn't buy this for those particular reasons but just as a multi vitamin.I've been giving her this for about 2 weeks and her bathroom issues are gone and she uses her bathroom regularly(and normal stools).and I can tell her hair got thinker and smoother.BUT she hates the taste(smells very strong as well) so, I have to wrap those up with other treats(those pill pockets)."
2,these ideas are not new to most loving moms,"I totally agree with the author that children are the most wonderful gift...but her ideas were not new. Love notes have been around for a long time (I give special treats to my husband and friends as well) I'm a kindred spirit with her sentiment, but the product lacks content of new ideas or information."
1,Re-evaluate,"I have since found out, since this was a gift, that the material on this pad was very inferior. It actually rotted and fell apart. My friend put it in the trash last week. I would not recommend it to anyone."
4,outdoor cushions,These are very nice quality and comfortable. Everything was as expected and came in just a few days!
1,Horrible quality of the Cushions,I bought Strathwood Chaise Lounge chairs and Cushions to comes with them. The chairs are great. The cushions didn't survive more than 3 months before the material ripped apart on both of them leaving ugly green dust on my guest cloths. Really bad quality for an outdoor furniture.
2,Color Blind,"Don't expect the ""blue"" aka ""Admiral Blue"" cushion color to look like the color in the picture. The actual color of the Admiral Blue chaise lounge cushion is a dark blue. The picture in Amazon shows a medium blue color. When I un-boxed the two Admiral blue chaise lounge cushions I bought I double-checked the invoice and the tags that are attached to the cushions to verify this was indeed Admiral Blue and not the Navy Blue. I do indeed have Admiral Blue cushions. I had picked the ""blue"" color option.Bottom line is in the hot sun these dark colors will be absorbing lots of solar energy and will be hot and may show signs of fading faster than a lighter color. These are assumptions though.They do look good and are comfortable but I must admit I expected the color I saw in the picture. I'm funny that way. ;)"
5,Strathwood Chaise Lounge Cushion,"The cushion is well-constructed and of good quality fabric. The generous amount of padding makes it very comfortable. Compared to other cushions of same or greater price, it is a great buy!"
4,Nice Looking Product,"product came on time, well packaged and fit right on the Strathwood Longes I bought. Good price, good workmanship. I'm satisfied."
1,A Green Powder Has Formed on the Cushions,"I purchased two of these cushions in December 2010 and had them in storage until June of this year at which time I put them on my lounges. In July I noticed a green powder on my white dog and then on my grandson. The cushions had a film of green powder all over them. I vacuumed them, but a green powder kept rising to the surface of the lounge. If I swiped my hand over the cushion it had a green powder that wiped right off. Amazon did credit me 25% of the price of the cushions as I didn't want to pack them up and ship them. Amazon didn't know how much, if any $$ could be given me on return. I thought I could wash them, dry them and they might be OK. Nope - A green powder forms on them each time they dry. Has anyone else had this problem? I am going to try to contact Strathwood and see what they say. Meanwhile, I wouldn't recommend them at all!!"
5,"High quality, double-sided, 11x17 paper","These are high quality, double-sided, 11x17 paper that you can find online. Epson doesn't maked this type of paper for some reason. I did a thorough search and found these.The only bad thing is you have to pay for the shipping since it's from the 3rd party seller. Other than that, I don't think you can find a better for this type of paper for this price."
5,incredible,let me be short and to the point. This is such an incredible cd that i couldnt imagine losing it id simply sacrifice my food for a week or so and re-purchace. I heard it on accident and it was almost instantly one of my favorite cds never gets old never dissapoints. It sounds a bit like pumpkins a bit like placebo and a bit like (yes im serious) the beatles in their sargent peppers days. This is a must have.
3,A good set of flashcard problems,"The 501 positions examine your approach to the game from beginning to end.Robertie's solutions so closely mirror my JellyFish Tutor recommendations that I have simply dropped the examples into JellyFish and only consult the book when I have a disagreement with the bot.Therein is the second value in this book for me: Robertie's analysis is succinct and sticks to themes over theory. When I do perhaps 50 positions quickly, only noting where I differ from the bot, and then read Robertie's suggestions for these positions, I usually find a recurring theme pointing to a weakness in my game.For me, this book is ultimately what I've made of it, Robertie has provided the necessary resources and I recommend this book as such."
4,Easy to read and excellent writing guide,"I will never be a Janet Evanovich and have never read her books although I am familiar with her as a great author. But I do write (only one novel and several non-fiction) but this little book is an excellent and easy read to help aspiring writers with the entire writing process. She begins characters, moves through structure and all the other points many of which I never thought of and ends with publishing and editors and agents, you name it. What I like the most is the question and answer format and how she weaves examples from her own books to make her points. Great little book for writers or anyone interested in the process."
1,i can't believe it......,"I was attracted by the cover of this DVD. The cover, as you can see, was related to the Engulf war. However this is totally not the case..... The story of the ""Rangers"" is nothing about the engulf war. Moreover, there is rare gun fight in the movie. The worst thing which i can't believe is that i find many scene of the film are copied from a old movie called ""navy seals"".... How come !!!!!! This is the worst DVD i have ever brought."
1,P.U. This movie stinks!!!,"Don't bother to watch this. The acting stinks, special effects stink, directing stinks, story stinks, writing stinks, and the camera work stinks. Rangers change clothes between drop plane and landing, inside of drop plane looks like an office hallway with a net hung on the wall. Matt McCoy keeps getting this stunned look like he just remembered he left the baby on the car roof. The inside of the Pentagon is mauve and looks like it was filmed in an abandoned dot.com office. There are no redeeming qualities except maybe as an educational tool about how not to make a movie.I put this in the movie rental drop box so no one would see me returning it."
5,Great Ale Glasses!,"Very Satisfied with the glasses!Was amused to see Ugly Betty, et al, drinking out of the same glasses in a London Pub!"
1,wrong product,This appeared to be the exact item for a gift but the wrong product was shipped and I wound up purchasing elsewhere for more money
4,Good Simple Pint Glasses,"I bought these to etch for my husband's birthday and they were just what I needed. The packaging is a bit flimsy, but all arrived fine. I which I didn't have to bu 12 - I have 8 leftover."
1,Couldn't finish it,"Sorry, but the main character of this piece was so unbelievable I couldn't finish the book. His reactions to the events around him are so phlegmatic that he comes across as one-dimensional. Why should I worry about what happens to the main character, when he's so nonchalant about his own best interests that he *leaves the scene of a crime*, thereby implicating himself and stymying the investigation. If Condoleeza Rice had a boyfriend and she found him dead, her life would become pure hell. She would most certainly NOT be allowed to continue to advise the President, comment on national security matters, or be sent abroad in any official capacity. The idea that the hero of ""Blowback"" can do that while not even being inconvenienced by a police investigation is ludicrous. I couldn't continue reading this silly plot."
5,Colleen Sexton is tremendous live,"Colleen Sexton shines on her live album. Its a great addition to my CD collection and I've listened many times. She rocks out on some of the songs and some of the songs sound so beautiful. She is so versatile. And it was great to hear her live with a band. She does a great job on Promised Land, In Between, Scarecrow, etc. Erin is a fun song. She does an incredible job on Cliff Eberhardt's my fathers shoes. I've seen Colleen many times live and this CD truly captures her live sound. Get the CD, it will be a great addition to your CD collection. And see her live. She's fantastic!!!"
4,A good shirly temple movie,this movie has a very sad part. While walking across the road shirlys mother gets hit by a car. then shirly has to live with bratty joy. but all ends well.
3,One of her better movies.,The movie has the seen that the TV networks always have qued up with her singing: On the good ship lollypop.
1,Not for practitioners (or wanna-bees),"Written in the style of Cunninghams books, this tome fails to offer realistic information on Druidic practice. While the text is precise and often very detailed, this book fails to make the connection between the present and the past. Moreover, it's author (a convert to Catholicism) bases his theories on his own ideas and not on anthropologic evidence. Failing to hold a degree in anything remotely related to the subject matter, and not having real-first hand knowledge of druidic practice lead me to seek more authoritative sources.I recommend this guide to anyone who just wants some basic info on Druidism. If, however, you'd like to follow this path, a more practical guide (Cunningham or others) is recommended."
3,"Not the best, but etertainment worth the price!","PC games have featured number of sports-based titles. But we have not seen much of Volleyball and definitley not Beach Volleyball. In that way, the Power Spike Pro Beach Volleyball has gathered many curious onlookers.But, PSPBV doesn't offer anything much different from or better than what has appeared in earlier volleyball games-other than the inclusion of real-world volleyball professionals like Gabby Reece, and an easy-to-use targeting system for spiking the ball or making passes to teammates.The game has a rather small learning curve.So you save time on breaking your head to master the game and is good for any age.Though the game lacks much of originality and has rather blunt graphics, Power Spike is still an entertaining, low-priced volleyball game."
3,Something is missing.,When there is only 100 something pages you know something must be missing if the guide is for a RPG. It does what it is supposed to do (lead you through game) but thats about it.
1,Way over priced,I never heard of anyone selling a new or used walkthrough for more than $15.00. I think I will go to the bookstore and get a brand new one! What a rip off. Thank U.
1,authors won't ever find perfection,"The authors of this book are looking for someone that does not exist--the perfect man. They seem to be prejudiced against fat people and people who have a mental illness. Come on ladies, you don't want to be a passionless doormat, but a little kindness would help your cause. She who hath no sin, let her cast the first stone!"
4,satisfied,satisfied. will recommend it to friends to order form this site. It is cost friendly and you save using this site
5,Forgiven 5 a True Blessing,"""He Is Alive"" the latest release from the Christian rock band 'Forgiven 5' is a must have for Christian music lovers. This CD runs the whole circle of ""rock"". not too heavy and not too light, He Is Alive is a very pleasurable musical effort."
1,for what it's worth...,This screw driver is a piece of junk. The carousel frequently jams and the bits fall out of the shaft if faced down. Incredibly poor engineering.
4,Good screwdriver,"I've had no problems with this screwdriver. Changing bits is very easy, and switching out carousels is not a problem either (though it can be a problem if you forgot where you stored the extra).I wouldn't think it would hold up to super heavy duty use, but mine has been sturdy enough to survive drops and regular use."
4,This thing is really cool!,"Being able to change bits in a heartbeat is AWESOME. What a terrific idea! This will be great around the house, but like a previous poster said, I would like to see a heavy duty version. At 2 bucks a piece, I wish I ordered 10. After seeing this in person, I probably would buy one at regular price (my opinion could change in a couple months... we'll see how it holds up)."
4,UNPREDICTABLE PLOT,"The book had my attention from the beginning. Great character development and descriptions. They weren't so long they were distracting, but helped me understand why someone would act the way they did in the book. I love trick endings and it was nice to have several."
4,Would make a great movie!,"This was a remarkable story about `the greatest team you never heard of `. 10 of the players on the University of San Francisco Dons made the NFL and 3 became Hall of Fame players. The school's publicity manager was Pete Rozell, future Commissioner of the NFL during its peak growth period. One of their best players was injured before he played in the NFL but became the first black official of any professional sport; he officiated for 25 years.Well, why hasn't anyone heard of them? It was because of racial discrimination from the outside, and that's what the story is about.This would make a great movie. You couldn't make this story up! Is anyone in Hollywood paying attention?"
2,A Good Newspaper Article at Best,"I was doing research on the wonderful story of small Washington & Jefferson college going up against the mighty Cal in the 1922 Rose Bowl-with a black quarterback nonetheless! I thought this book would be a good addition to my research. However, the book cost me over [money] with tax and the book is SKIMPY! Thin to begin with, the book is mostly filled with photographs and reprints of newspaper articles and letters. It would have made a good article for PARADE magazine or a newspaper but I felt it fell short as a book."
2,This book could have been 20 Pages long,"I think that this book is very important in that it tells a very important story in sports history. However, this book is very redundant. We are told on the dust jacket that they had lots of their players go pro and that they were denied a bowl bid because they had black players. Beyond that the interesting facts are few and far between. Also, it did not do a good enough job convincing me that the only reason they were denied a bowl bid is becaue of their race. One look at their schedule from that year suggests that possibly the Orange Bowl was looking for a proven team. On the whole the book left me unsatisfied."
3,"good beat, bad language","This is a pretty good dance album and the song ""Captain Jack"" is really good, but that ""f-word"" is in there quite a lot and I really just don't like that, especially if kids are going to be hearing it. There are enough words in the world for you to get your point across (if you have a knowledgeable vocabulary) without using language other people could find objectionable."
1,Waste of Money!,"Say this kid speak at a Conference. He is a nice guy and appears to be pretty well grounded.However, this book stinks. I bought it thinking I could share it with the youth group I'm involved with. Thought it may be interesting. The book is a major bore. A Sleepeer. Picked it up several time thinking it would get better and more interesting, but no substance ever evolved in the chapters. Do not waste your energy or time on this book!"
2,Doesn't Live Up To The Hype,"I'm a big fan of early industrial bands like Coil, Throbbing Gristle and Nurse With Wound, so I thought Brighter Death Now would be right up my alley. Terrifying, they said. Dark industrial soundscapes, they said. The truth is that this album does little other than bore. The ten minute tracks consist primarily of feedback drone and the same repeated clanging sound effect repeated ad infinitum, with the occassional sample and little to no variation. In fact, I find most of the tracks to be indistinguishable from each other. When I first purchased this I lay in bed with the lights out, hoping for a scare, but all I got was too bored to fall asleep.If you're looking for REAL industrial soundscapes, I suggest Nurse With Wound's Spiral Insana, or Coil's How To Destroy Angels EP."
3,"Typical ""perfect"" characters - predictable ending","As always, the charcters are perfect in every way possible - Danielle Steel needs to bring in average main characters to her novels. I'm getting tired of her larger than life characters"
5,Special Delivery,This book kept my interest and was very easy to read. I couldn't seem to want to put the book down.
2,Frustrated!,"This is the second DS book I've downloaded for my Kindle & might be the last because I'm so irritated by the number of typos in this book! Considering the electronic version costs more than the paperback, it is unacceptable! I've only noticed this problem with DS Kindle books."
1,Where has the author gone ?,"Can anyone tell me what happened to the real Danielle Steele ? I am the first to buy her books, as soon as they hit the shelf, but Special Delivery was the worst buy ever!The plot was weak, and the characters even weaker. I predicted the ending one paragraph into the story, and had to endure the rest. Luckily I read fast.There was no feeling, and the author made no attempt for the reader to create any empathy towards any of the characters, which she usually does so well.What happened to the author that wrote 'Palomino', 'Season's End' and 'Golden Moments' ? As much as I loved her older books, I would gladly wait longer to read one of her new books, if it were better than the ones being put out every three months now.!!! Come on Danielle, you can do better, and that's why we still buy these terrible ones!"
4,Special delivery,Very entertaining I always enjoy Danielle Steel she is one of my favorite authors. When I read her books I feel good inside.
4,Special Delivery by Danielle Steel,I read a lot of Danielle Steel books another Love story with a twist. I enjoyed this book like all the others but a little predictable. If you are new to Danielle Steel pick this on up and give it a try.
2,Far fetched....,"I agree with other readers. This book was totally unbelievable and predictable. I could not relate with the characters or the situation. I read it only because it was given to me by a friend. It's a skimmer, meaning: it isn't worth reading in detail, just skim to get the basic idea and believe me, not much is missed."
2,Asleep in 45 minutes,"One of the more boring movies I've rented, couldn't get past the first hour. Not crazy about English-speaking Germans, for one thing, but nothing about it inspired any interest for me. Also a low-budget production, all close shots, nothing that would have taken much time or money to put together. This isn't a problem for me if the story is engrossing and the acting good. Not the case in ""Good."" Here, you sense a scene coming up (such as the parade, with distant sounds of crowds) that will require a broad shot, lots of people, a substantial view of city, etc. Nope, cut to yet another close interior shot making it feel as though the whole thing was shot in some generic studio in Culver City with a few modest european street sets on the back lot. A real snoozer."
3,WEAK might be a better title...,"Mortensen is center stage as a German academic whose bourgeois aspirations allow him to become part of the Nazi nastiness ahead. GOOD is a casually episodic tale exposing the hypocrisy of middle-class morality, and the pervasive appeal of insidious party politics. The corporate metaphors loom large. There are some heavyhanded music bits alluding to the Greek chorus, but they will generally fall on deaf ears. The crude concept that Mortensen is basically a ""good"" man is laughably debatable."
3,Slow moving movie,I really love Viggo Mortensen and was really excited to find a movie of his that I had not seen. This was a very slow moving movie and very hard to hear their voices.
2,Not as described,"Color is not yellow like shown in picture, it's a gross color I could only describe as ""baby poop."" They fit fine and are comfortable, but look very cheaply made."
5,Earth Shoes,These Earth shoes are wonderfully comfortable. True to size. Many compliments!I love them and would recommend them to all who only wear Earth Shoes!
4,Generally well balanced presentation,"I used this book as a study guide for the sacraments in my parish for adult faith formation. It is a readable, generally balanced presentation of sacramental theology along with a very brief, but very informative history of each of the sacraments."
2,"Cheap, noisy pump","We bought one of these at our local pet store. The first night we used it, the fountain was completely silent. I had to check it a few times to make sure it was still on. The next night, it sounded like a small refrigerator. Something must have gone off-kilter in the pump, causing it to vibrate, but I couldn't find anything stuck or broken. Back to the pet store it went!"
3,Mixed Feelings,I bought this for my two small min pins. They were totally freaked out by it at first but after an hour of staring at it they loved it. They drank so much more water compared to a simple bowl. However after a while it got so time consuming to clean and the slime build up was gross. It started to grow a variety of colorful slime. I think the pink slime it grow is what really freaked me out...GROSS...There were too many tight spots to get into. I ended up having to clean it everyother day. I had it for about 3-4 months before the motor died. It also didnt hold that much water. Im currently searching for a new one.
2,"Reservoir hold only 50 ounces, not 216 ounces","I ordered the Jumbo size, which states ""capacity of 216 ounce reservoir."" I was therefore not happy when I received it to find that the water reservoir actually holds only 50 ounces. Even counting the water in the bowl, it only holds a total of 124 ounces. I have no idea how they're claiming this holds 216 ounces! The water capacity simply wasn't big enough to keep me from having to check it constantly to avoid the pump running dry."
5,Cat Fountain,"My cat loves it. He used to meow at us until we would turn on the faucets for him and drive us crazy. Now, he just goes to his fountain because he is getting fresh water. It does need to be cleaned on a weekly basis and I have to put fresh water it daily to stay full, but other than that it is great. I received it really fast also."
2,Works great but...,"I've had my Fresh Flow for a few years now and the unit works well. In fact, I purchased one for my mother's pets. I'm giving this fountain two stars because within the last year, the company has changed their filter replacements to this cheap piece of garbage that has barely any charcoal in it and slimes up quick. The new filters cost the same but now you have to replace them more often. I would think a cheaper product deserved a cheaper price, especially if you have to replace them more often. Check out the filters here on Amazon, you'll see I'm not the only one dissatisfied. Because of this, I am switching over to the Drinkwell system. I've checked out their filter system and it looks a bit more substantial."
4,Pampered pooch,"I never really thought anything beyond simply refilling my dog's water was necessary. Now since getting the Petmate Fountain I really enjoy it. It was a gold box special so the price was right ( half price ). It is actually a very clever device. It recycles water through a carbon filter much like an aquarium does. I'm sure it improves the taste of the water, since it's all we truly need for LA water.Hope this helps your customers.Sincerely,R. Matsumoto"
4,"Good Product, Note on How to Fix If Pump Stops","I bought this fountain (despite the warnings that it broke after a few months) and the same thing happened. Thinking there must be a simple solution - why would a company continue manufacturing a defective product? - I called PetMate. They were surprisingly helpful. They asked if I'd ever cleaned the pump - and I thought, of course! If my three pets are hanging their heads over this thing to drink, there will be fur accumulating in it. Petmate walked me through a simple process to clean the motor which I did, then refilled it with water and it worked wonderfully. I really don't like taking things apart & fixing them, but in this case it was so easy I couldn't complain.If anyone has a Petmate fountain & it stops working, give the company a call at 1-877-PETMATE (1-877-738-6283) and they'll walk you through the process."
2,Leaky!,"I had purchased the Petmate Deluxe model of the 50-ounce Pet Fountain for my cats. That works exactly as described and my cats drink more than they did from bowls of water around the house. I like blue, and the basic model seemed as if it would perform the same as the deluxe model. My cats still drink from this model, but it doesn't fit together as well as the deluxe model and, as a result, it often leaks, leaving puddles around it. If I purchase another, I will only get the Deluxe model."
1,This thing SUCKS!!!,This is my third unit I have purchased. I like the way it looks and what it does when it WORKS!!! It is definitely not for more than one pet. When I had one pet it worked for about a year. Now that I have three it lasted 4 months. Wish they would fix the problems. My pump no longer works. It makes horrible noises even when full. Just not a great addition to someone trying to save time and give their pets good water.
3,Not long lived,"I love these fountains, but this one only lasted three months before it started to leak like a sieve! Took it apart but never could find the leak. I had the medium sized one for over 2 years before it quit working. Try that one."
4,It's just ok,"My cats really like this fountain, but after I clean it & change the water it makes a vibrating noise(very annoying) which lasts about 2 days. After that it runs pretty quiet...I tried trouble shooting like they suggest but it still does it. All in all it's ok...I just wish I didn't have to wait 2 days for it to quiet down."
4,Great!,"My cats really like this fountain and it was recommended by my vet (he didn't even sell them!) I have 2 older cats and had taken one to the vet and they said he was dehydrated. While that was because of a thyroid condition, I figured this would encourge them both to drink more and it has! They both like to drink from the fountain slide and rarely have I seen them drink from the bowl. The only thing I wish for with this is a bigger resevoir. Between natural evaporation and 2 cats drinking from this, it seems like I have to fill it alot. It is keeping them out of the toilet too!"
2,"Noisy at times, durability issues","These are reasonably nice and quiet when they work right. However, it has been my experience that they eventually get noisy and that the durability is poor. I would not recommend these unless you plan on replacing it every few months."
1,disapointed!,"I thought this product sounded like a good idea. Fresh water for the cats through a filter. It was hard to clean, hard to fill, and the cats kept going to the other water bowl. Better idea was to give them a clean bowl of fresh filtered water each day, much easier."
1,Pump Broke - week 2,"My cats finally started using this fountain, and then within about a two week time frame, the pump broke and I have to return it. :( But Amazon was amazing, they credited me. Once again the customer service goes above and beyond!"
3,My cats are not drinking more,"One of my two cats has constipation problem. That is why I got this product. Unfortunately, she has not been drinking more water. Another cat has not been drinking more, either. The cleaning of this product is not difficult, but if this product gets broken, I will not buy another fountain. Cleaning a bowl is much easier, and I give filtered water to my cats any way."
2,Good concept..... not such a great product.,"It's great to have flowing water for cats. My cats love running water from the faucet. The water in this fountain is not running, though, but flows down a slope, so it's difficult for the cats to even see the water running. My cats didn't drink from the part where the water was running. I later bought a different flowing water pet fountain that runs more like a faucet, but we no longer use that one either because it is plastic and our vet recommended that cats should only eat and drink out of glass bowls, not plastic. Apparently the plastic containers can cause irritations. One of my cats had a swollen lip and the vet suspected the plastic water dish as the culprit. Too bad no one has made a glass flowing water fountain!"
3,They sent me WHITE instead of Espresso!,The Petmate is extremely quiet and works great! I have no complaints about that but you can't email the seller which is Amazon and tell them they sent the WRONG COLOR!!! All you can do is return! Very frustrating!
1,xx No good xx,The motor was way too loud & the water barely flowed out. I quit using this one and ordered a better quality fountain from a different brand ((Drinkwell Original Pet Fountain)). You get what you pay for...I do NOT recommend this product.
3,Works but difficult to clean,"I have had this fountain for over three years and the biggest problem I have is with keeping it clean. There are many nooks and crannies that are nearly impossible to get clean. The filter is in an odd location, it is located at the top of the unit in a reservoir where the water holds before being sent down the ramp, as such the water does not really get forced through. In addition the pump, while it has worked well the entire time, gets clogged with fur -due to the location of the filter after the water gets pumped - especially if you have long haired cats. The switch on the power cord failed after two years and I just bypassed it. All-in-all a good unit but I will not buy another one due to the difficulties in keeping it clean."
2,Buy the Drinkwell Fountain instead,"Pet fountains are a great way to keep my cat from trying to drink out of the faucets. I bought the Fresh Flow a few years ago and thought it was great, but the plastic it is made of is not the best quality and the filter clogs up constantly. I finally threw the Fresh Flow out today after several successful months with the Drinkwell Pet Fountain. The Drinkwell Pet Fountain is definitely a better quality product and hasn't clogged up once! The Drinkwell Pet Fountain also holds more water (even without the extra resevior) than the Petmate Fresh Flow. If I could go back in time, I would have paid the extra $10 for the Drinkwell instead of paying for both in the long run."
1,inferior products,"i bought 2 of the petmate deluxe water fountains in the past year.the pumps(which were kept clean by washing in water and vinegar)both expired after a few weeks and a replacement pump also failed.pumps were made by jebao(chinese).what is so bad about this is the fact that i contacted the petmate offices in texas with a handwritten letter and they don't even have the courtesy to send a reply.you can't seem to find any info on the web as to contacting corporate offices,and i see why.so if you want a product that is dependable, and someone who stands by their products,don't pick petmate.i have learned my lesson."
4,Save your kitties kidneys!,I found out the hard way that house cats do not like to drink water that's been standing (which explains why they're always pawing at the bowl!) As a result they don't drink nearly enough water and over time their kidneys are damaged. This fountain is a great improvement and my boys are drinking a lot more frequently. The fountain is so quiet you don't even notice that it's running. An excellent product!
1,Leaks like crazy--poor design,"We've had a terrible time with this fountain. The water is pumped into a chamber that goes up over the seam where the top of the fountain joins with the bottom, and this seam often leaks. Poor design."
3,Not completely happy,Pet Fountain is a little noisy. We've had it a month and cat hasn't used it yet. Hope he will get used to the noise. THe price was good but maybe you get what you pay for.
3,Hard to clean,"I have had this fountain for about 2 years and this product has served its purpose for the most part. My cat loves the running water and started drinking from it right away. The motor has become weaker as time goes on. It is not noisy, unless (as other reviewers have previously written) the water level is low. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this product or buy another one as it needs to be cleaned often and is very cumbersome to clean. To clean properly, the whole thing needs to be taken apart and there are small little areas that are almost impossible to get to without a Q-tip or something similar. I don't have the time required to clean this unit, so I am looking for other alternatives."
1,Very disappointed,"I ordered this Petmate as a replacement for the larger one I had for nearly 3 years. This one came with a defective pump. The instructions say that the pump should be noiseless. Not the case! It made a loud whoosing sound, even after I took it apart and cleaned it several times. Tried a replacement pump - same results. I could not figure out if it was the pump or poor fit of the plastic housing. Finally got tired of dealing with this and threw it out today."
3,Works well except for the Noise,"We had this same model previously and got rid of it only because of the built up hard water deposits. We purposefully searched for the same model online since we couldn't find it in our local stores. The replacement unit is great EXCEPT for the NOISE it makes. Periodically, it makes a grinding noise we never experienced with the first unit. The noise continues until you hit it (we tried taking it apart and reassembling it, adding more water, etc. - nothing worked so this was our last resort). The problem is, you have to hit it 2-3 times a day. Too bad, since otherwise our pets like it and the first unit we got never had this issue."
1,Don't bother,"Of course your pets enjoy fresh water but this fountain is not the answer. It does not keep the water fresh and becomes dirty rather easily. My dog, who drinks filtered and non-filtered water, did not enjoy the taste of the water after it ran through this fountain. However, the hubby and I decided to keep it hoping he'd get more adjusted to it, and he eventually did. But there were other problems: after religiously cleaning the fountain every three days it still grew mildew on the inside within four months. I wrote to Petmate for a solution (figuring this was a defect) and the company never bothered to reply. I wound up with a product I can't use and a bunch of filters for it. So, in short, bad taste for the animals and prone to mold, from a company that doesn't stand up for its products."
5,Great Product but Beware of Hard Water,"This is a very good product that lives up to its' claims. Complaints about gurgling noises are related to the water level falling below the water intake valve or hair clogging the intake on the pump itself. Both of these are user maintenance issues. If you have six cats, as does one of the other reviewers, water will run out and hair will accumulate quickly. However BEWARE of using with hard water. The pump has a VERY SHORT lifespan with hard water. If your water is hard you have 4 options:1. Don't buy this unit.2. Buy extra pumps ($12)3. Repair the pumps yourself (clean minerals off the shaft and apply special lubricant)4. Use distilled water (this is what I do)"
3,too many parts,"there are 6 parts that have to be disassembled and reassembled each time you clean it... overall, it is more time consuming than washing a plain bowl and filling with filtered water. it is a good product if you don't mind the extra work.it is quiet. cats adjusted to it after a few days."
2,You get what you pay for,"I spent a long time at Petco comparing this fountain with the Drinkwell. I could see no difference except the price, so I bought the Fresh Flow Deluxe, which was half the price. Three weeks later the Fresh Flow Deluxe has quit working. I changed the filter and checked the pump, but I can't get the thing to work. On the other hand, my friends are still using the Drinkwell they bought several years ago.Oh, and by the way, where it says that the Fresh Flow Deluxe is ""ultra quiet""? That isn't true either.I'm going to buy a Drinkwell and toss the Fresh Flow."
5,Great product for the price!,Great pet fountain for the price. It was cheaper then Walmart and came with free shipping. Plus it works great so what can I say? Im happy!
4,my cats love it,"It is a pretty decent water fountain, but I shall buy a bigger volume. My two cats can drain the water once a day, so I have to fill the water container everyday. When the water level is low, the pump is kind of noisy coz it sucks the air.I bypass this pet fountain with a small UPS right next to my computer. This small appliance runs 24/7. I bet it will save some energy."
1,So noisy we found it unbearable...very cheaply made too..,"Great looking and a great price lead me to try this product. The pump on this thing was completely and acceptably noisy. The product was no cheap and the directions so poor that while I was assembling part of product broke off (a small clip). No matter how great it looks, if it's really noisy it won't work for me, let alone my felines, who wanted no part of the new loud creature. I quickly returned it and spent the extra dough to get myself the fabulously functioning Drinkwell 360 degree pet fountain. Well worth the extra money and it's pump is whisper quiet. Honestly. Just wish the Drinkwell had a mocha or chocolate brown- it's one color choice of speckled grey and white looks kind of 80's! (I'll happily forgive that because it's easy to fill & so quiet and my 5 babies seem to like it...)Drinkwell 360 Pet Fountain"
2,Lasted one year.,"The pump completely died on me after one year of use. I wish there was a better pump as these type of devices are clearly healthier than a standing water bowl, but without an effective pump they become useless.Someone also ought to make a better design such that water doesn't slosh all over the floor when moving or picking the unit up. As I have to frequently clean the entire unit (due to the weak pump!) this is a major issue."
2,Cat Hated It,"It's not the prettiest product--kind of looks like a toilet, and I think the sound of the motor was what put our cat off. The cat, who usually steals our water in whatever form or location, won't go near this fountain when it's on. For your reference, we also have a Siamese, which can be a picky breed."
3,"Good product, but don't buy it if you want a fountain-like waterer","I found this product while searching amazon.com for a fountain-like watering mechanism for my two cats. Seeing the price and the display image, I purchased it. When it arrived, of course, I discovered it was not a fountain, but a water bowl with a continuous stream of water that runs from the top of the product into the bowl and circulates back up again, passing through a water filter in the process (Oh, and might I add that if you don't thoroughly clean the product at least once every three days, the circulation vents will get blocked up and grimy, slowly converting into a reddish mold...so be sure to change it regularly). It does, however, add air to the water in the circulation process, which my cats like :) So, overall, this is a good product if you want a water bowl with a couple extras, but click the ""back"" button on your browser if your looking for an actual pet fountain."
2,Terribly disappointed,"Fairly easy to put together. Within two days the unit started to make lots of noise; vibrations, grinding, etc. This unit is obviously not put together very well. I recommend buying something from this company in stores to avoid the hassle of shipping back for refund/exchange."
5,Petmate,This has been one of the best purchases I have made for my pets. My cat just loves it and will even let our dog drink every now and then! Anyone that has a cat that is picky about what they eat or drink needs to get one of the Petmate 24960.
4,Bought it for the design and colors,"I was looking for a all white and orange phone to match with my living room design. This phone was right on, had a groovy retro design with slick lines and orange/redish lights. This is the only phone on the market with these specs so it's not like I had a lot of choice but this phone works pretty well, and meet my expections and needs."
3,"A beginning sailor might learn somethings here,","A collection of articles, some good, some not so god and a couple of bad ones with poor advice. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. ."
2,Sincerely disappointing,"Perhaps it's a little bit refreshing for a normal album to significantly overshadow a greatest hits compilation, but that doesn't mean it should happen.Simply put, Relationship of Command is a far better, and far more listenable, cd than this greatest hits compilation. There's just something missing from most of the songs on this cd (save the ones from Relationship of Command); that edge and distinctive sound that's so prevalent with the mars volta and (to a significantly lesser degree) sparta just isn't there with most of these ""hits.""Do yourself a favor if you're just getting into these guys: Pick up relationship of command, then forget this hits compilation ever existed. Repeat if neccesary."
1,Not as advertised,"To whom it may concern:I was suppose to receive a ""box"" set of books. Instead, I received 5 mangled books stuffed ina mail bag. Very displeased!"
3,still happy,"I was pleased at how quickly the books arrived and that they were (mostly) consistant with the description given as good. However, one book had missing and out of order pages - error from the manufacture but I had to get another copy to be able to finish the book. While this happens, this should have been noticed by someone. Will order the next set but with some reservations if this will happen again."
1,I didnt even get it,"I would give a real review if my books were delivered... I didnt get them, and its the second time this happen ^_^ I just gave up buying anything here!"
3,Drags on and on and on,"I started reading the Left Behind series before I realized there are 16 BOOKS in the series. As a Christian I really enjoyed the first book, the second book...the third book.....but eventually it just starts to feel like the never ending story. I was on book 10 when I realized there were 16 books, and frankly I stopped right there and decided I'd had enough. I was already bored, the story was moving along way too slowly....and to realize there were that many more books! Ugh!I think this would have been a great story if it had been shorter. I think a series of 6 - 10 books would have been more than enough. I enjoyed hearing the prophecies from the Bible, the story and characters were ok...it just started to drag. It should have been shorter."
4,Great Fictional Story!,"The biggest critique I have of this series is the fantasy. Many simple events or ideas are rather absurd in reality even if you set aside the theological aspects. Other than that critique, great easy read. Recommend for all ages, especially teenagers. This is a fund story that brings mystery, suspense, and intrigue. It is an easy read where at times it is hard to put the book down. Although not to the caliber of, it reads very similar to the Harry Potter Series, or LOTR."
3,looks good won't last long,"looks very nice, keeps coffee warm not hot too long, but handle won't last long. poor design"
5,Great travel mug!,Keeps my coffee hot/warm for at least 1 hour. This is great for anyone on the go! the handle is a nice addition to other mugs that do not have this.
2,:( Such a let-down...,"While RBF brought be to the ska/punk scene and I basically bleed Aaron and Scott, their newest album is a letdown from what I come to expect as good quality RBF. In the same manner that Less Than Jake's Anthem and B is for B-Sides are slowly becoming worse and worse, I think that this album can only be tolerated by former RBF fans. If youre interested in ska i would listen to Turn the Radio Off first, the Why Do They Rock So Hard?, then Cheer Up!, THEN this album"
2,Disappointing...,"I'm as big a RBF fan as anybody, I've been to 10+ shows, got all their albums, hell my band even played on stage with them in Milwaukee, but I must say this album is thoroughly disappointing. I just picked it up this morning and I've listened through twice, on my third as I type this.First off, what is up with the cover/insert art? I'm assuming Jive/Mojo spearheaded that.Secondly, the lyrics are really trite (let's see how many times we can repeat a 3 word phrase throughout the song) and it doesn't even really sound like Aaron singing, maybe he's just changed a little bit. Whatever's it is I'm not crazy about it.I've played this on 3 different soundsystems (none of which are shabby) and this recording/mixing/mastering just sounds sub-par. Ultimately I feel it lacks the tenacity/energy I'm so accustomed to. But I'm not gonna give up, I'll keep listening, maybe it will grow on me."
1,BORING!!!!!,"Basically this album sucks! I love the fish but they have become so boring. The lyrics are always cynical, we suck/you suck. Maybe they should start writing some songs with meaning because I'm getting bored with the same thing over and over again.As for the music, the horn section is great, as always, but the songwriting is terrible. The choruses are not good ol' sing-along RBF we used to get, they're just..boring! The production also leaves nothing to be desired.I just gotta say, Im glad I downloaded this album because I would be dissapointed to spend money on this. A band with such a huge following like RBF should be growing up with their fans. Don't buy it, download it, then email RBF and tell them they are right... they suck!"
5,"Joy, Italian Style.","I was amazed that a movie first released in the early sixties remains as non-dated in its perspective and humor as this one does. I picked it up chiefly due to a reference Scorsese makes to it in A Personal Journey. Certainly, Divorce Italian Style is a farce but the emotions and events it contains are ones with which all of us can relate--even though none of us have a need for a Italian ""divorce."" One also can appreciate the mystique which European films had--as compared to the more stodgy state of American cinema--during that period. I've always loved Marcello Mastroianni and his efforts here are outstanding. He plays his role perfectly and is a figure of both contempt and admiration. All of the acting, however, is great. The plot unwinds slowly but does not end predictably (on the whole). The climax is nuanced and the last frame tells us much about the nature of men and women."
2,DVD is NG.,"What a waste. This is a hilarious movie, but the DVD transfer reminds me of a bad print at a second-run theater. This is the second DVD I have purchased from Hen's Tooth Video (the other being Peckinpah's Cross of Iron) and it will be the last. The transfer has not been augmented in any way for DVD. The scratches on the print are very distracting and there are no special features to make up for it. I look forward to the day when another company issues this worthy title in a manner that takes advantage of the DVD format and is appreciative of its customers."
2,Hmmm...affirmations with negative words....not for me.,"Most likely he means well, but Sri Siva's choice of words was very disappointing to me. He chose negative words to motivate people into the positive realm, and this is like saying to an athlete, ""Don't lose! Don't lose!"".For example he chants, ""do not wait, do not wait"". For this topic of affirmations, I would have chanted the otherside of this coin by saying, ""I am pro-active. I take action."" and so forth. Maybe this works for some cultures but in American language there are so many other words to choose from that bring visions of positive thought rather than struggling thoughts. Other than that, at least he doesn't over dub the words with loudly playing music."
3,Meh,"While this product feels very refreshing when used, it doesn't actually do anything the company claims it will. It did no harm, but it did no good either. I would not recommend it, nor ever buy it again."
3,hawaii five o,never really like this seemed like the people were to snubby and they had nothing to be snubby about
5,glad to have this dvd,watch the first esp. so far it was been great just like the seasons before i can not waiat to have all seasons of hawaii five 0 thanks a million bill
3,Seriously Addictive Beat,These guys can realy rock out but they are so tore up that I had to return the cd. The lyrical message was just rank and disgustingly thoughless. If you like this style of music however I would recomend an awsome band called the Presidents of the United States of America.
5,this is the best,i would of given this a 10 star but amazon lets you give up to 5 stars...but all i have to say is that this is the best i have ever heard yet!!!
3,"Less melodic, more psychotic","3 1/2A solid attack sucker punch of flavored, offbeat hardcore came with the Armenian-american groups debut combining relentless hostility, eccentrically powerful vocals, melodic transcendence, and a dash of old-world flavor to boot. It's no wonder the band immediately stood out in a genre all but known for it's generic torment. Not all of the album works properly; the songs eventually tend to bleed together, at worst into a type of pummeling oddball metal gimmickry, but a distinct mark upon their craft hinted at an important career to come."
4,"Well, It may take awhile to get used to this cd","When my friend gave me this cd in a trade for one of mine, I dident know what to expect. I had heard ""sugar"" which I absoulutly hate, and ""Spiders"" which is a great song. Well I had heard alot about ""Suite-pee"", ""War?"" and ""P.L.U.C.K."". So at first listen this cd, preety much sounds all like a bunch of loud yelling songs. But its more than that. Ill rate the songs 1=weak 2=why? 3=Average 4=very very good 5=exclentSuite-pee=5, Know=4, Sugar=2, Suggestions=4,Spiders=5, Ddevil=4, Soil=5, War=5, Mind=3, Peephole=3, Cubrt=3, Num 12=4, Pluck=5,"
4,Blistering Full Bore Melee,"I've never been in to Korn or the gimmicks of Slipknot, but there is something about System of a Down that interests me. Sure i like their views on politics and word issues even though i can't relate to some of them. But it is their diversity that they express through their music that puts them yards above the rest of the bands in this musical genre.At times it is as though the band is on...with the machine gun style guitar and drums, but it is their ability to change as though they have just taken some downers that i like, into a form that resembles a ballard for a quick second!! The lead singer is extremely talented with his vocals. Sometimes when he is singing real fast i think that he sounds a little like Mark from Guttermouth.The best songs on this disk would be Sugar and CUBErt. I like this cd better that there latest release Toxicity. But this cd you won't be dissapointed."
5,Nowhere To Go But Up,"The new millenium has brought forth another top-notch metal group. System of a Down are set with original, catchy, and passionate vocals, combined with explosive and delicious music. It would be impossible to choose a favorite track, yet ""Spiders"" (their second, mellow hit single), ""DDevil"", and their marijuana-debate tune ""Peephole"" stand out as metal classics. Do NOT be narrow-minded; System of a Down will blow you away."
1,"Pure Borefest, Nothing to Live for.","How could people even call this band the best of all time, this is just another reason the music industry is pathetic, this isn't even ""metal"" it's pure political pop crap, and yes system of a down is as pop as feminem, stupid whiny songs, typiciallyboring power chords, and the same old crap, this and the whole nu metal rap metal needs to go away and it should soonIf you want a better look at this subjectListen to anthrax/Public EnemyF*** Nu Metal"
4,Mental,"Fast, chaotic and unpredicable (especially the vocals which vary wildly from high-pitched warbling to death metal roars) but they never let the diverse elements, such as jazzy sounds, take over too much - their big, crunchy riffs take centrestage. Suite-Pee, Know, War, Spiders and the bizarre Peephole are the highlights, but there are no weak songs here."
1,buy brand name instead!,"I bought one of these for my digital camera, as well as 2 others made by the camera's manufacturer. This battery only lasted 3 months before it stopped accepting a full charge. It rapidly declined to the point that it only lasted about 10 minutes in the camera. After another 6 months, it is dead entirely. Meanwhile, the brand name batteries, which got much more use, are still going strong after 3 years."
3,Dawn of the Dragonslayer,"For a B movie, not to bad. There a a few parts where the camera shakes a little in the start of the movie but all and all not a bad movie, I have seen worse. The story line is good with a little romance thrown in. I would have like to seen more of the dragon but that is me. Acting is not bad. But for the price, it is not a bad watch. I will likely watch it again."
2,A Very slow but thorough potential view of Roman life!,"Its really hard to give a review on this because, although interesting at times, this book reads like an encyclopedia. I liked it....I think.....at least a little. Ancient Roma ploitics could be riddled with action and to a point this tale had action but it was all verbal which seemed tedious. I loved Fatherland by Harris bu have been less thrilled with all his other works so far. This didn't live up to the hype and my expectations."
2,Very disappointing,"I have read all of Robert Harris's books and I am a great fan. Fatherland and Pompeii were really good novels -- especially Fatherland. His latest -- the Fear Index -- available in the US next month -- is a very good read. But, to get back to Imperium, the problem was a lack of a real story and too many characters (with difficult names to remember!!) I fully expected a really good novel about ancient Rome but I came away very disappointed!"
4,Rome from political eyes...,"Usually when I get a book about Rome I look for violence and blood. There wasn't much of that but what took it's place was almost just as good. It was about the politics of Rome and everything that goes with it. The plotting behind the scenes, making friends your enemies and your enemies your friends.What this book showed me is that politics have ALWAYS been corrupt but there will always be good men to fight the fight. This is a good book and one that I would recommend, but not if you're looking for the ""muscle"" part of Rome. This is more the ""brain"" part."
5,Provacative outlook if the war of races was reversed.,"Sherman Alexie brings to life a ""shocking"" and revolutionary thought to mainstream america. What if all the rage, built upon unjustice and every broken treaty Indians have been forced to endure, came to life and decided to kill whites, because they were white. Because they were the decendants of people who had committed these injustices? In his book an urban Indian is the most likely suspect in a rash of racially motivated murders in the Seattle area. Compelling and dramatic, this is one of Alexie's most controversial books yet. I loved it, and not just because I myself am native, but because Alexie's words capture the heart of the Native American resistance. I loved it. I thought it was terrific."
4,A most excellent sourcebook.,"Every theologian, occultist, and pious scholar should get this. Virtually every angel, spirit, devil, and lowly demon is named and defined. It also includes a vast list of alternate spellings and comparisons between the mysterious spirits. Angelic hierarchies are also given, as well as A FEW of their seals. It is absolutely perfect for all who have ever wondered just what an angel is."
2,The real Y2K will disappoint you....,"Having first hand knowledge of the Year 2000 computer problems, especially involving the banking industry, will definitely lead to a different scenario than this book.There will be no cataclysmic events, just a minor blip here and there. Granted, there may be minor power disruptions, but midweek, things will be back to normal.Planes falling from the sky, riots, and countries going belly up, doesn't even merit a mention in the true scenario. The plot of this book is so off the mark, the author seems to be cashing in on millenium-hyped sensationalism of the unsuspecting.Learn how to spell ""buses"" (rather than ""busses""), and don't waste your time on a sequel."
4,A fast paced look at hackers gone good as Y2K crisis looms.,"Hey, I liked this one! Fast and interesting read and the facts are right (for computer types). It feels like Farenheit 451 as computer hackers band together to BECOME the vital parts of New York City before the big one (Y2K) hits. Loved the chaos, moving across time zones around the world, headed for the Big Apple."
1,Inaccurate and disappointing,"I only read the first few chapters and was bombarded with references to 1999 as the end of the millennium. Next year is the end of the millennium, the new millennium starting in 2001. I didn't even finish the book."
1,People! You are paying a fortune for CARDBOARD!!!!,"My daughter's grandparents were here from overseas and they set her loose in a toy store, returning with this carrying case and two other cc items for close to the price of a grocery bill. It's made of cardboard. No critters are included. You could have the fun of decorating a shoebox with your child and use that instead--no charge. Try a rubber band and voila! A latch.Do we play with this? Sort of. When we play calico critters, she moves them into her Dora playhouse (picked up free at a thrift shop) and she moves MY family into this overpriced box for ME to use. Buyer beware!!"
1,Avoid Toshiba DLP,"This is an annoying and expensive choice for any family and it should be avoided. You need to plan to buy a new lamp, which will cost you about $218.00, every year. That doesn't include any fees for service calls too. A TV that will fail at any moment and require a new lamp is a terrible thing. Calling Toshiba service is a nightmare too."
1,Don't get the 46HM84 Toshiba DLP TV,"Hello - I want to warn people about this TV.We have had ours for about 4 years now and about ever 8 months we have to buy it a new lamp. The lamps are now a bit lower in price but each time we have bought a new one it has been aroung $250 including shipping. Once we bought a lower priced lamp that was supposed to be OEM, but that lamp failed and then the seller applied a re-stock fee.The TV is not worth the money.All channels other than HDTV come in blurry so wanted to warn others not to waste their money on this defective TV.Bad job Toshiba."
4,Even his rough sketches have a quality few can match,"It is a tribute to the artistic genius of Leonardo da Vinci that even his rough sketches have a dynamic quality that few people can match. The 60 sketches in this collection are sometimes rough, and yet they exhibit a detail and a precision that make them look like finished works. The level of detail in his anatomical drawings is so exquisite, that the bulges in the muscles appear to extend out of the page. Many of his sketches also represent daily events such a storm over a village, a grove of trees, plants in the wild and sometimes just the heads of people met in public.My favorite is the sketch of drapery laying on an upraised surface. So lifelike that it is superior to many photographs, the level of detail is amazing. Arguably the most talented person who ever lived, da Vinci is clearly one of the best at drawing the world has ever seen. After looking at these drawings, no one could ever doubt that supposition."
2,Better as A Short Story,"My mother loved this book and sent it to me along with ""A Good Yarn"", as we also are knitters. However, I felt that the author did not delve deeply below the surface of each of the 4 characters. Each chapter was repetitive and predictable. Carol's character in particular was tiresome, but a good cook, although probably not as good a cook as Jacqueline's daugher in law! Chapter after chapter droned on while I waited for the plot to move forward. I enjoyed the Seattle setting but wished that there was more substance to this tale. It is a sweet story and a quick read with many repetitive chapters. Ms. Macomber could have ""ripped out"" a few chapters or gave each character greater depth. And now I have to read A Good Yarn."
4,Debbie Macomber does it again,"I love this author, and this book is in keeping with her best!!! I loved the characters and the pace of the book, although alittle predictable, it still comes with charm. I could feel the characters joys and pains, (which is a trade mark, I think of Debbies) and came full circle with their stories. Debbie, you did it again. Thank you for this book it was a great story. Can't wait for the next. Loved the hardback addition, made this book feel special and it was."
4,First review............,A friend told me to read this book. Enjoyed the first book in this series. The author had a way of pulling you into the story. Looking forward to future books by this author.
5,Excellent software. Fun!!,"This is really, really good software. Even the youngest preschool computer users will be able to navigate through these games and have fun - and learn at the same time!High quality graphics, fun (and not annoying to adults) sounds, and lots of different activities to keep little ones interested and busy and having fun.I highly recommend this software. We have it installed on our PC and it runs very well."
2,Basic,I have been into this sport for a couple of months now and I found this book extremly basic even for my level.
3,A Very Old Fashioned Story,This is the story of a young English woman who packs up and goes to Africa to be with her husband in the days of European colonization. It gives a good picture of the lifestyle of the white masters and some insight into their attitude towards the black servants and labourers. There are some aspects of the story that are quite shocking to read but it is valuable as a reminder of what colonization meant to indigenous people.
4,Perfect Size,"I ordered this for my granddaughter's tricycle. It is the perfect size for a trike. Because it is all plastic, it should be very easy to wash off if it gets dirty. My only disappointment is that the plastic strips to attach the basket either stick out several inches or you have to weave them into the basket. The later is ideal, but when I did that, one plastic piece in the basket broke....so I don't recommend weaving the attaching strip into the basket."
2,Omron HEM-780/HEM-780N3 Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with ComFit Cuff,Did not distinquish and could not tell what was in ground until digging it up. Disappointed.
4,Hunter,This works good my son has had a lot of fun thinking hes finding gold it cracks me up every time I see him digging after it beeps
4,Impressed,Have had this MD for about a month now and I'm impressed with the accuracy of it. It's light weight and easy to use. Have found coins as deep as 10 inches. Would recommend this to anyone. Excellent for the price. Only problem is the analog meter really doesn't give any help on searching.
4,TBecker,My first detector and it hasn't seems to work great. Found all kind of different metals. No Loot yet.
3,They look like oven mitts!!!!,"If you're looking for warmth, these are it. But the picture doesn't show you that these gloves are big like oven mitts. If you don't care what you look like and warmth is all that matters, go for it. If you want to look like you're wearing oven mitts pulled up to your elbows, you've found the right gloves. Personally, these should not be recommended for skiing because they're just ridiculous looking."
3,Does not fit my VTX,A google search brought me to this product. Does not fit the VTX. They appeared to be a nice product for what ever they do fit.
4,"Satisfied, thoroughly","I can not say I haven't had anything other than a pleasurable experience with this camera.It takes not only great videos, but also great pictures. It picks up color so well. My digital camera has a higher resolution than this video camera, yet this video camera takes much better pictures.The only pit is learning on all the functions, and figuring them out. A little complicated, and I'm a tech nut. Thats why I gave it 4.Buy an extra battery (as goes with every camera).I give this product an A."
4,"Video good, software is non-user friendlyand awkward.","Video is not particularly bright when using indoors. Software is ridiculously confusing. Will not let you download and use your own burning software, must use theirs.Light weight and fairly easy to use. Handle/button placement does not allow easy use with right hand."
3,Not what's pictured - just 1 cup,"First--the seller, greenfeet is great, they took care of this right away.BUT - this listing is for one, single condiment cup, not 4 cups as pictured. It can be confusing because the description uses plurals like ""cups"" and ""them"" to describe a single item, and shows 4 cups in the picture. It's a nice bamboo condiment cup, but I think it's a bit pricey for 1 cup."
5,fun projects,"My aunt suggested this book for me and I love it! There are some really cute ideas for quilts or just wall hangings in these. I have gathered things to make one already, but I still need to get the hand prints going. The only problem I see is that it could be an ongoing project...like years...if you choose to wait for your kids to get older and get their growing hand prints. Good ideas though and could be implemented as cards or other things, not just done on fabric."
5,¡WOWWWW!,"Una vez empiezas a leerlo, no lo puedes dejar. Compre uno para mi y una vez termine de leerlo compre 5 mas para regalarlos. Y a esos que le regale compraron mas para otras personas. Creo que eso significa que es buenisimo. Ojala muchas mas personas lo pudieran leer para que salgan de volar de ese pantano en que viven. ¡Me encanto!"
1,wrong item sent three times!!,wrong item was sent three times. such a hassle - I called and was told that they would not be able to correct the order until I received the incorrect item for a third time.
2,Bad quality.,"I am sad about quality. Rusty on the side, both. Diamond surface not uniformly covered. And fine surface not very flat, have some tubercles."
5,More unforgettable songs,"More of the unique art of Elizabeth Price: 8 new songs ranging from the religious (""Baby Sweetness"", ""Sugarbowl"") to the sentimental (""My boy and his motorbike""). Including the darkly humorous ""Henry please don't chop off my head"".It is a pity that the production is not very good. This album could have sounded loads better than it does.Elizabeth's old friend Amelia Fletcher does her bit in this album. So do Cathy Rogers, Peter Momtchiloff and Gregory Webster (actually the record is credited to both him and E. Price, though all songs were made by her).The young nun with the crucifix dropping rose-petals on the earth shown in the back cover illustration must be, I think, the French Carmelite St. Thérèse of Lisieux (1873-97)."
1,Watch when ordering from third party on Amazon,I ordered this item from Amazon but received Bert's Bees lip balm. Not even close to the correct item! I never did get an answer on why it was misrepresented but did get a full refund and a gift certificate from Amazon.My only advice is to double check the third party companies when ordering.
2,Works good but doesn't allow IPSec VPNs and lousy support,"I've used the Sonicwall 10 (only difference is # of users) for years now. And it's worked well. But their support is awful. And I use TimeStep VPN (used by GTE/Genuity's managed VPN service) at the office. I cannot connect my laptop through the firewall while using the VPN software, even though it's IPSec compliant. Even if I tell the firewall to allow all packets to go to my laptop, it still blocks traffic. It's trying to be too smart for its own good but they refuse to add additional services for IPSec HA to the filters (it has ESP and IKE). I've raised the issue to them for 8 months now and they basically tell me to f**k off. Wait for one of the other products like the Watchguard or Netscreen to mature and buy one of those instead.Kent Schumann"
3,Only for the diehards,"I'm a huge John Mayer fan, but if you aren't, this is not a must. The album is good, but a bit too polished for my taste. I was hoping for something raw, ala ""Inside Wants Out,"" but Mayer's guitar and vocals seemed too highly reverbed and smoothed out; not the acoustic sound I was hoping for.Also, a few of the songs have multi-track guitars. I was hoping Mayer would only use one guitar, play the song out live and bang it out; not so.So, diehards, get your Mayer fix. And for all you others out there, have you listened to ""Continuum"" yet? That's the album you should be buying. Better yet, get old Mayer, because that is his best."
4,Great addition to Continuum,"It's good, quality recording and of course brilliant guitar work; a fresh look at the already awesome songs of Continuum. I think he shows some real maturity and good taste on this CD. My favorites have to be ""In Repair"" and ""Belief."" The accompanying slide solo in ""Belief"" is awesome!"
1,You have to be a jerk to really enjoy this.,"I was displeased enough with this awful book to return it to the bookstore. At first glance, it really did seem like a good-natured and fun book. Only when I cracked it open and home and honestly started reading it, did my hackles raise and my teeth grind. Instead of being a mildly sarcastic, witty read, I felt slapped in the face. I pity any new writer who picks up this book in hopes of gleaning some useful insights on writing. If I were just starting out, I would flee from the idea of becoming a writer. While sprinkled with a handful of fun and funny anecdotes and observations, the rest of the book left the most bitter taste in my mouth. I couldn't wait to rid myself of it."
3,"Decent Frame Might Cover Tabs, Though","Decent enough license plate frame but depending on where your state's renewal tabs are located, they might be covered by putting this frame on vehicle. Ours are low on the plate and unfortunately, were."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen, the plot and the acting is bad and the violence is without merit! Pass and watch something else!"
2,Eye See Trash,"I picked up this movie after seeing it on the shelf at my local library,now I wished I had left it back.I never heard of this movie and the story sounded intresting so I gave it a chance but it was an epic fail.The actors were dull and the movie had no suspense.It could have been better if done right.Definitly one of Stallone's worst.Skip this one.Believe me you don't want to sit through this garbage."
2,I.C.U.,"I had never heard of this movie until yesterday when I bought the VHS version of this movie for a very good price. Not normally a fan of ""cop"" movies or Stallone movies ( except Rambo ) , I decided to give it a try. What drew my attention to this movie is the fact that a serial killer is on the lose and for the strong violence and gore indicated on the box. I've seen worse movies but I've seen better! Although I will say that the acting was good and the cast was good. This is by no means a horror movie but a suspense movie. There were some cool scenes in this movie and was somewhat entertaining."
2,A waste of a good cast,"There was absolutely no reason for them to cast Tom Berenger in this. It seemed like an insult to him, having a role that really has no significance in a movie. An extra could have played the part and given it the same feel. Sly didn't have to be in it either. The only reason why anybody watches a Stallone film is so they can watch him kill every one, or at least beat them up. Sly only killed one person in this film. I don't know if the ending was supposed to be a big surprise, but it really didn't matter anyway. It was ridiculous to even think that anybody would go to the d-tox center that they went to as well. Regardless of the fact that Stallone didn't really do a lot of violence to people, the R rating still reflects strong graphic violence/gore and profanity. Eye See You was a half-way entertaining flick that would have had the same effect on the viewers without any famous people in it."
3,A very good start. . .,"This text is one of a short list that explicitly claims to help one pass the PHR/SPHR tests. It provides a great deal of review information and is well written. Still, what you have to do is use this book as a stepping-off point for further study. Where the author points to additional resources, you have to take it upon yourself to either follow those reccomendations or others that provide the depth that is needed to answer questions that will be completely unexpected, based on the lightweight practice exams questions included."
3,Not a fan of this book,"I really did not like this book. The study questions were horrendous and sometimes did not even have a correct answer. I would not recommend this book to someone in the HR profession like myself. After taking the PHR exam, I felt this book did not prepare me to excel. With that said, I am sure it could be a useful guide for those new to the HR field. And despite my personal feelings, my score went from an 82% on the HRCI pre-assessment to an 88% on the real thing after reading this book."
3,Works okay... haven't found anything,"Seems to have some difficulty detecting certain items. I tried it on the beach and got a lot of false positives when I brushed the sand with the ring (easy to do when you are trying to stay 1/2"" above the sand).It is a pretty good price though based on what other sites are charging.It's a little embarrassing because people look at you strangely when you use the thing."
3,Not good enough for $40+,"I got a few samples of these after an ulta salon facial burned my face. I am happy with this product, not with the facial but thats another story. I wouldnt ever pay more than $20-25 for a bottle of this stuff because I like barrier repair more and ill splurge on that. It is cool stuff though, felt nice. If you have the money to blow on stuff then go ahead, you wont be dissapointed"
5,Good for beginners,This book was a great introduction to meditation. As a novice I learned the philosophy behind meditation and what the goals are. It covered all of the other religions or customs that use meditation as well to help with your search for enlightenment. Really great book!
2,Not helpful for the beginner,"Although this book gives you many ways on how to meditate, I think that kind of defeat the purpose. Why do you meditate in the first place? To relax and get things off your mind. With so many techniques taught in this book, the ironic result is I have too much information in my head to start meditating. Frankly, why do I have to read 150 pages before I can meditate? A shorter book has got to be the way to go."
1,knots,"Book is very hard to follow. Drawings are difficult to put into practice, I found a site on the web with animation of knot tying which is much easier to follow."
3,"great, but too short","I love the safe material this bib is made of and overall it functions well, I just wish it was a little longer. My daughter ends up with food on the bottom half of her shirt that the pocket doesn't catch."
2,Choker bib,"I did not like this bib. The collar is hard to adjust around my baby's neck without choking her! It feels too hard and cuts into her neck. I regret buying it. I was looking for a bib that wouldn't get too messy or wet during feedings, something I could just wipe. But this bib was way too uncomfortable for my baby."
3,Fun for a month. 3.5 stars.,"It's very intriguing, very fun, very, VERY silly and will keep you glued for AT LEAST a week. In my case the fun extended well over a month. I kept coming back to enjoy the silliness and difficulty. The dark, charcoal-like character models are too cute.The Rub Rabbits are so silly and the games have tons of variety.Although I do wish to sell this to anyone willing to pay 10 bucks for it, I've had my fun with it and enjoyed its unique charm. Hopefully, besides the Rub Rabbits, part II will be longer and even quirkier and fun.They tried I suppose. It was OK for what it was.Favorite games:PaintParachutePlantDance3.5 stars."
4,Japanese quirkiness at it's best,"This game isn't the best game ever.BUT, it is fun. You join a team of performance artists to prove to your would-be-girl that you're the guy for her. This leads into a plethora of zany challenges where you do everything from blow out candles to swat bees away from your lady.The end is a little tough to beat, but the games style and charm easily make up for it."
4,slightly addictive,"First of all, this game was not sexual or inappropriate in any way. The game consists of you (a male) playing mini games to try and get the girl of your dreams.The mini games are fun and I found it hard to stop playing unless I couldn't beat something and got frustrated (some are pretty difficult). Though I do wish they had come up with more mini games and a longer story because the game is relatively short and they repeat some of the games.The whole game looks like a comic book - I really like the way they did it because it's different. I also enjoy the cute little songs that they play.This game is definitely worth the money! Check out that low price!"
5,Great for dogs with back / hip problems,"My Rottie just LOVES her bolster corner bed. At the end of last year she was operated on both hips for dysplasia and just couldn't find a comfortable spot in the house to lie down. Everytime she'd turn over onto her back, she'd complain. After I got her this bed, all complaints ended and I'm sure it helped her a lot in her recuperation. Whenever she's in the house, she's on her bed, most of the time all four paws in the air. I really don't know how she'd be today if I hadn't gotten this bed for her. On the technical side, I'd say it's very well made with good quality materials. I just pass the vacuum over it weekly to pick up loose hairs and hang it outside every 2 weeks to air it a bit. Other than that, I haven't had to do anything to it yet. Great product!"
5,Great Music,"This CD is probably best known for the Theme From ""St. Elsewhere"", the title track, Night Lines, and Power Wave. Great and creative music by Dave Grusin, the same man who brought us music from The Electric Horseman. What's on this CD, however, is more or less today considered Smooth Jazz."
3,Buy Now,"Just a word of advice....If you are a Carpenters fan, and haven't yet bought this CD, now might be a good time to get it. I've been looking around at several import stores who used to carry it, and they no longer have it in stock. So I'm wondering if it might be going out of print soon. I haven't heard anything official or anything, but it seems to be getting harder to find nowadays. Live In Japan (2-CD, 1974) is a better set, but it's probably a better idea to purchase Live at the Palladium soon before it becomes obscure. (Of course, it will probably come back into print somewhere down the line.)Jim Meadows"
3,Only for the big Carpenters fan,"This album offers insight into what a Carpenters show must have been like. Unfortunately, the band's showmanship falls flat on this album, I believe because you can't _see_ the show. Even then, I suspect this would have been a show far better experienced in person."
5,Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex Season 1 - Volume 1,Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex Season 1 - Volume 1 was pretty good and I liked it
5,LIFE and other joys....,"This album is so amazingly unique and charming..its a shame they had to go on making albums so completely different from this one. But any credible band or artist doesnt want to make the same album twice, so I take this album for what it is...pure fun. The voice of Nina is what sugar would sound like in musical form...coupled with the brilliant arrangment of catchy, upbeat and smooth music of Peter along with the back-up of the talented band, this is music for a sunny day...or to shed some light on a rainy day. This music came out in the mid-90's when it seemed people had a sense of humor about music, and the only thing being played on the radio and MTV wasnt just cry-baby whiney booty call gangsta un-imaginative ""rock""...oh I long for the days of innocent music, but for now..I pop in LIFE and am transported to the days when music had more variety and wasnt so serious, or even to a mid-60's lounge if I play the right track....great album, great band."
5,Every song a gem.,"Every song on this record is good. No filler. I remember when it came out years ago seeing the video for Carnival. Later the Cardigans had a hit w/ Lovefool. A perfect record. buy it.I also recommend The Hives, and Turbonegro."
1,"Bad, Nigey, Bad, Bad...","What a terrible book! No insight on FZ, but tons of insight on the author. Save your money. Here's the insight. She's an idiot."
2,the most unnatural odor,"I really hate to do this (having been a fan of the Van Pattens for years) but feel that I must to save you money. Opening up a can of this substance will release the most ungodly stench into your home that you have ever had the displeasure to smell. To call this stuff ""natural"" is like saying that Michael Jackson is ""normal.""Not only will my felines do everything within their kittie powers to sidestep the pungent aroma spawned from this evil can, but I can't even manage to feed this to the most malnourished squirrel on the block.When they produce this kind of product, they really must get some sort of quality control that keeps the stench in check.Sorry."
3,Decent basic reference,"It is a pretty good book for basics. It explains sun, soil, feeding, planning, watering well from the standpoint of a gardener in Connecticut. The tone is a little harsh sometimes. He makes me feel guilty my garden does not get enough sun to get over 100 tomatoes off each plant, but hey, I can't knock down my neighbors' fence and trees and my wife won't let me cut down the big sycamore.The suggested schedules would not be very useful for somebody in a different climate. There are a few crazy typos in there, like recommendation for two 100-foot trenches for asparagus for a family of four. I am pretty sure he meant two 10-foot trenches. On balance the advice is very worthwhile and I would recommend it for a beginners bookshelf."
3,It was Ok,"Don't get me wrong, the music isn't horrible and I really liked the movie. ITs just that I can't see it a extrodinarily good. I'll listen to it once in a blue moon but that's about it.A couple of the piano pieces a very pretty and so is some of the orchestral music. Its just that nothing stands out as spectacular or truly grasps my interest.Also, I am still fuming that JOhn WIlliam's score for Harry Potter 3 lost to this score. FInding NEverland isn't bad, but it did not by any means deserve to win against John WIlliam's masterpiece known as the Prisoner of Azkaban.However, I will say this is a more calming and relaxing album. For some of you that's fine and I'm not going to beat you up. However, if you are looking for a soundtrack with a little more flavor, diversity, and granduer, try Harry Potter 3 by John WIlliams or the Time Machine by Klaus Badelt"
3,"Interesting quotes, weak theory","If you want a lot of well-selected quotes covering the history of financial speculations, this is a good book. But if you want a postive story about the historical development of finance and how speculators carry new developments to an extreme, then I would suggest Money, Greed, and Risk by Charles R. Morris. I read Morris' book before this one, and found this relatively disappointing. I have no connection with either author."
2,Please - No More Footnotes,"I'm fairly shocked by the extensive number of 5 star ratings for this book. This book is quite painful to read, but not because the stories are tragic or the warnings frightening. Though the messages contained within are important, the author rambles incoherently and the extensive use of footnotes is overly distracting. The footnotes for many pages are longer than the primary text and should have been incorporated into the main story line. Chancellor is in need of an editor with an iron fist toward readability."
3,Like the series.. but one of my books was defective,So I was in the climax of the Assasins (page 402) and then my book jumped back to page 269- (about 100 pages were duplicated and the book was incomplete) I wanted to SCREAM... Luckily one of the ladies in my office book club loaned me her book so that I could finish. I'm on the Mark now and haven't noticed any errors....
5,Live in Japan is a treat for Carpenter Fans.,I feel Live in Japan is a great In Concert Album. I strongly disagree with the above reviewers that said it is just OK. Karen's Vocals soars and adds an extra excitement to the classic hits without taking away from the original studio recordings. The opening Superstar and Close to You are my favorites on this album. The Oldies Melody contains some great additions to the songs that are on the Now + Then Album. I do agree with the reviewer that said the low point is Pete Henderson on the Oldies Melody. It is a distraction because his singing takes away from the Carpenter Sound. Richard + Karen announcing the Band members at the end of different cuts of the first Cd adds a nice personal touch too. It's worth every cent of the high cost if you love the Carpenters. The back up band does their usual great job and are a pleasure to listen too.
1,It's punk....it's pop.....it's doo wop!!!,"Yeah, these guys are awesome and stuff. They like, have this sound that like totally like blew my mind. I mean these guys are awesome!!! Not ugly enough to be a Ramone blew my ... out. So did that ""hit"" track ""gotta go"". Okay, it's wisecarver. You guys rock, and will foreva!!! Peace"
5,A desert island recording...Gorgeous guitar,"The air gets cleared quickly and any trace of pollution, noise, havoc, and confusion is laid to waste when you listen to these emotional and intelligent recordings by Barbosa-Lima. The material will never date...and challenge you with stunning technique, tone, and melodic content. Very high on my list of great recordings...listen to various samples from different CD's of his...you will hear variations in recording techniques...some sumptuous, some more natural, but all wonderful, and all the type of recordings that one loves to display their Hi-Fi's on. Carlos plays a Richard Prenkert guitar on some of his recordings, and they are made in Sebsatopol.Listen!Ecstacy."
2,"Simply Another Hits Cd and If You Have the Others,Why Bother","This Tony Carey cd released in Germany on the Teldec label in 1989, is simply a greatest hits cd of songs over a couple of albums, including 5 or 6 of 10 songs off of one album, Blue Highway, So if your a fan and dont own Blue Highway, good buy, the other couple are on two other albums, so 6 and 4 doesnt make this cd much of a greatest hits cd. Once again you get the great vocals and arrangements of Tony Carey, but why bother, I give this greatest hits a 2."
3,Newjack,I had read other books by this author and found them fascinating. Newjack was OK but not as good as the others - many repetitious/similar events.
3,NewJack,"Average prose, a real cure for insomnia with some interestging tidbits. It's a book I now own that will forever collect dust."
5,Excellent!,Excellent read! Highly reccommended to those who enjoy nonfiction. Perfect for those who are interested in sociology or psychology. Two thumbs up!
5,This will change the way you work,Bosses and soon-to-be bosses need to read this. Two-sided accountability -- a brilliant new paradigm for looking at relationships within organizations. Forget politics - this is a NEW type of organization and a new set of rules for working together effectively and creatively. The case studies make this real and applicable to YOU and YOUR organization.
3,"A good album, but where is are her CLASSICS?","Don't get me wrong. This is a nice album to have on disc, but it's very commercial and Essra's voice ain't as good as it once was. She put out two great records in the early seventies; the first being Primordial Lovers and the second being the selftitled Essra Mohawk. I believe they were both put out through the Warner Brothers family of labels. Where are they? Both get five stars a piece."
5,One of the Top 5 Comic Books of 2004,"This is ""Hollywood Blockbuster"" done right. The A-Team with a Three Kings edge, Andy Diggle writes intelligent action entertainment better than anyone, and his cynical take on world affairs gives this series a realistic, sharp edge that's missing from most other stories in this genre. The characters may be a bit generic, but like a B-movie with A-list actors, Diggle's scripting lifts each of them above their stereoypical cores. And Jock? His jagged, bombastic artwork evokes the hyperactivity of a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. The Losers is my high-octane, not-feeling-the-least-bit-guilty pleasure every month and this collection of issues 7-12 is the perfect way to get a healthy dose of one of the best ongoing series in comics today."
5,ONe of the best,"I have this on kindle but can no longer find it on Amazon. This is an amazing book. Although the title is a bit misleading, once I read the book I understand why he chose it.It's taken me over a year to attempt to write a review of this book. I can't do the book justice by trying to simplify its message and coming up with an ""in a nutshell"" review. I have determined that this will be a book I will go back to over and over again for the rest of my life. It is far more than I expected. D. Martyn Lloyd Jones is by far one of the greatest christian leaders of the century. Although he passed away many years ago, his message is completely relevant to today...and that is how the Lord works. I am amazed at how I can apply everything taught in this book to issues we face today. It does not age as so many pop christian writers works become stale.You will not be disappointed at all. Get this book. Share this book. Keep it for a lifetime."
4,Good,This is very large textbook. The information is good if you want to know the principles behind the dental hygiene career.
1,clinical practice of the dental hygienist--Wyche,"I ordered this book with the idea, based on how it was advertised,that it was a summary of Esther Wilkins book. Instead,it was a workbook, without answer keys. It requires that you also have the book "" Clinical practice of the Dental Hygienist"" by Wilkins, for it to be of any value. I was very disappointed as to how it was represented by amazon.ca and the editorial review is not correct for the product."
3,Digital Still Picture Quality is horrible sometime,"I just got the camcorder. The size is perfect, very handy, especially if you have a small hand. Nice design. Very easy to use. Clear manual. The softwares coming with camcorder are easy to setup.Took some still pictures at home under the indoor light. The picture quality is horrible, just compete with my (...)digital camera's quality.You got what you paid. I think it is a good camcorder for an entry level, just like me."
3,Not sure if it really make a baby smarter,"This was a fun book. It gave us things that we could do with the baby, and it seemed like the baby recognized Dr Suess after several months of listening to the stories in the womb. We did achieve many of the cognitive developmental milestones early, but I would not presume causality."
4,Fast development,"I've been using CF for a few years now and I am continually amazed at how much faster development is in Cold Fusion compared to many of the other options. We were able to roll out one product out in 45 days.Our shop used most of the features and the only real issues we've had were usually fixed in relatively short order. The only really sticky point seems to be with the mail handling tags. They aren't as robust as they should be... However, I know of some businesses where even the Secretaries are learning the basics of CF to do some of the more mundane tasks."
5,Love it,"When I was 6, when I got diabetes back in '98, I watch this movie. I loved this movie. I just watched it recently since I didn't it for a couple of years. I forgot of how much I loved this movie. I recommend this movie to those people that like adventure, love, friendship, & bravery."
5,Best movie ever!,This movie...is one of my favorite movies. I like is so much that I have bought it on DVD and VHS. I would recommend this movie anytime.
3,DVD Broken,"I purchased this DVD as a Christmas present for my daughter. When I went to wrap it right before Christmas, I discovered that the DVD was broken since I could hear rattling inside the container. I did not open the sealed plastic coating and still have it. Since I had done some ""early"" shopping, by the time I discovered it was damaged, the return date had expired. I did not sent it back since I would now have to pay for shipping and would only receive 1/2 of the amount I paid for it. I will not order DVDs in the future since I don't want to run into this issue again."
3,Where are picture discs?,"I agrre with mr. Schoditsch's comment regarding the switch away from picture discs. Not only with this series, bur oh so many. When we collect year after year of our favorite shows, continuity should reign. It's an important easthetic. CBS shows are now almost exclusively on non-picture discs. At least, studios, when many seasons have already been released on pic-discs, please continue so. (Another ex., Bewitched: Seasons 1-5, pic-discs; Seasons 6 & 7, non-picture).I gave a 2-star penalty for this, but the show episode's content - 5 stars."
5,found it!!,"bought detector to find ring worth $$$$ found it in 10 minutes. Already paid for itself !!! Worked great, got here fast. Great price!! Thanks"
2,"Bounty Hunter Land Star Metal Detector ""All Metal Mode.""","This metal detector is nice, notwithstanding, it performs poorly when in all metal mode. Initially all metal mode works fine, however, after half an hour of use the batteries begin to wear out and the battery low indicator does not come on. When all metal mode is used after half an hour of the detector's use, it just squeals uncontrollably. It's supposed to go off over metal and pin point the source of your initial find with great accuracy. Again, after thirty minutes of use of the detector, it will no longer go off over the source, it will just go off constantly, no mater where you hold it. I could hold it into the air and it still squeals. I made every adjustment I could and it just continues to make noise. This mode is worthless unless your using it with two fresh 9 volt batteries every half an hour. Finally, if you're hunting say meteorites for four hours, you can expect to spend over $56.00 on batteries for that afternoon."
2,"Great book, but buy in hardback - photo quality in the 1999 edition is poor","This is a great book, but you should buy a hardback edition instead of the paperback. I am a frequent visitor to Russia and I enjoyed the oportunity to compare and contrast Russia today with postwar Russia under Stalin. Unfortunately, Robert Capa's photos in the 1999 paperback are small and muddy. I could not even recognize places that I have visited many times. This book was a collaborative effort, but the 1999 printing seriously short changes Capa's contribution.I don't know if the images are better in the 2001 paperback or the Kindle version, but after reading the 1999 edition I got a copy of the 1948 hardback via Amazon. I recommend that you do the same if you want to fully enjoy this excellent work."
5,Post-war Russia through very talented eyes,"This wonderfully written book takes you through post-war Soviet Union, to farms and cities devastated by war but struggling to return to normalcy. Robert Capa not only adds wonderful photos but his role in this story is both funny and illuminating for any Capa fans. Written in the late 1940s, the story provides us with a very human side of the Russian people. The openness and friendliness of everyone they meet contrasts with the paranoia and hatred so present in the US at that time.I read this as both a photographer and one who was recently in Russia and the insight provided was very enjoyable and educating. Capa's mannerisms and method of photography allowed his subjects to open up and feel comfortable in his lens -- not an easy thing since so many of the people had lost family and suffered terribly. Steinbeck's writing is honest, funny and his skills as a non-partisan reporter really shine in this work."
5,Miles The Innovator,"you want 3 albums that have forever changed Music? then come get these.Miles Davis is One Of My Favorite Artists Ever.He is So Deep&Soulful Cool.these 3 Albums Explore The Depth,Range&Space of Miles.they are Timeless Jewels.not only a Great Price but Quality that makes them Worth Every Penny.these 3 Albums not only Give you 3 Different Bands or TOnes but Vibes as well.Miles was always about Change.THe Innovator of Cool Maintains His on these Disc's&more."
4,Probably one of the best kept secrets in Ska today,"Where to begin. The ingenuity of the Caddies are there wacky sense of style. Everything about this cd has the California Punk scheme all about it. But it ranges from fast to mellow to-SWING?Most probably taking a que from the Cherry Poppin Daddies, there is a Swing song on the cd. There trumpets are probably the most redeming quality, making it at times brilliant, but when the guiatar lags and trumpets fade it can be overly familier.Pick up the Mad Caddies for there new invations, as well as to get a taste of whats to come from this inovative, killer band."
4,In Love with the Music - Need Help....,"Inspiring story about the life of two amazing men. Have recently watched three times. Beyond the story content, am in love with the soundtrack. However, the piece that won't leave my head is the dance scene after dinner where the music is played on piano while Alberto dances with Ernesto's girl. Am consumed by this piece and cannot find it on the soundtrack or the name. Can anyone help? I really need to find a recording of this piece. Perhaps, Juan, you can help?"
5,"Yes, these discs work in the USA!","Everyone else already noted how great the original series was... Let's focus on something else: These UK Nettwork DVDs!First, I'm in the USA, and want to report that YES, these discs DO work in the USA! They really are Region 0 (there are lots of conflicting reports) which means they'll load and play in any region-locked DVD player anywhere in the world.Next - they are PAL, though, not NTSC, so you must have a DVD player and TV that can display them. Most current DVD players can handle this fine, with some converting the output to NTSC and others simply passing the PAL to the TV. Many modern TVs will handle a PAL signal, but not all.Finally, although they are ""digitally remastered"", the video quality isn't great. I have a feeling the source film (yes, this was shot on film) has degraded somewhat, and this is the best you can get. The audio is amazing, however, except for the one commentary track that was recorded to the surround channels instead of the main ones..."
2,Defective tape transport,"I'll agree with all the positive statements in other reviews--the one day it worked, we were pleased. However when we tried to use the camera the following day, we found the tape transport was not working--the tapes we recorded wouldn't play, and a new tape also wouldn't. It seemed to feed the tape but not take it up.The difficulty in obtaining service, having to mail it off to Elgin, is a problem...They really need to improve support for an apparent design problem, and service availability is a big negative."
3,"when they say ""small"", they really mean SMALL","The back brace arrived on time and to my dismay, it's too small for me. I'm a female, approx size 8,and I can hardly get the thing to stick (velcro closure and tightening tabs. It would be perfect for a runway model. Or even a very very gaunt male teen."
2,Please no more,"I can't believe they kept the same name. This sounds like Dokken with a typical black metal vocalist. Since ""Tools of the Trade"" they have fallen from grace a little more with each album. Thankfully they finaly hit bottom. Farewell."
5,Good product,"'97 Camry, after replace spark plugs with NGK Iridium plugs engine sounds more powerful. Should last another 100.000 miles. Would recommend to use this product. Amazon delivered one day early than scheduled."
4,Old School House Classic,"This is a cut that takes you straight back to the days of Colonal Abrams and Mr. fingers circa 1984-85. When house music had soul and rhythm. If you liked Mr. Fingers ""Introduction"" album you will thoroughly enjoy this listening experience. If you are not into chicago styled house this is an introduction into what it was (not repetitive beats with limited vocals). There are some other classics such as ""Martins Disco circus"", kano's ""I'm ready"", & Hugh Masekelas ""Don't go lose it baby"" that would make excellant complements to ""The musics got me"". All in all this is a proven starting point if you want to kick it to an old school house groove."
5,Triple Threat: The Best For The Buck,"The three albums this boxset contains are quite possibly the three best that Judas Priest ever put out. Priest has had heavier, and faster albums since, but none can compare to the gestalt they created on these three. British Steel put them on the map with Breaking the Law and Living After Midnight, two instant classics as soon as they were pressed into vinyl. Point Of Entry, though not as commercially successful, is full of lost gems. Solar Angels and Desert Plains were innovative for their time and great driving songs. Screaming For Vengeance made them heavy metal heroes. Every song on that album has been played on hard rock radio stations across the world. I highly recommend getting this, not only does it document the rise of British Heavey metal in the late 70's and early 80's, but these albums are all timeless and can be redicovered by younger metal fans over and over. For [the price] of a cd, this deal can't be beat."
5,GREAT ONE,"THIS STORY IS A PRETTY GOOD ONE IN THE SERIES. IT BASICALLY BEGINS WHEN THE HARDYS GET A NO NAMER THREAT FROM EGYPT, THEN THEY SEE A GHOST OF A PIRATE FROM THE 18TH CENTURY THAT APPARENTLY HAS HAUNTED WHALEBONE ISLAND YEARS AGO HAS NOW RE-APPEARED. THE OWNER OF THE GOLD HEAD OF PHAROAH RHAMATON 4 LOST THIS HEAD ON THE SHIP AND THEN THE SHIP SANK. THEY HARDYS INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER AND IN DOING SO ALMOST GET BLOWN UP. THEIR FATHER, DET. FENTON HARDY. GETS HIS BUTT KICKED AT LEAST 2 TIMES IN THIS STORY. THAT'S WHAT ESPECIALLY LIKE ABOUT THIS BOOK. JUST READ THE BOOK I AM NOT GOING TO EXPLAIN IT ALL TO YOU!! IT HAS A GREAT STORY LINE THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO KEEP READING. I READ THE WHOLE BOOK IN 1 DAY! EVEN SHORTER!! BUY THE BOOK!! YOU WON'T BE SORRY"
2,Weakest book of the original Hardy Boys pre-1959 texts.,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE APPLEWOOD EDITION WITH THE ""MAN GOING OUT A WINDOW"" ON THE BOOK COVER. Not the Grosset & Dunlap edition with the picture of the boys in their boat by a light house!While I generally prefer the original texts over the re-written books of the 1960's, this one is an exception. This early text edition dwells on the deep-sea diving craze of the late 1930's. Not Scuba-diving (scuba tanks were not yet in use), but diving with an airhose attached to a pump on the boat.The bottom line is that there is almost no mystery to this book, it is a dated adventure book about diving. If you have an interest in diving you will enjoy this trip back in time. If you enjoy a good mystery you will have trouble getting through this.The revised text of the 1960's is MUCH MUCH BETTER! One of the few improvements made when the books were re-written."
3,"So, so","I bought these because my son rips his velcro bibs off like Hulk Hogan, and I was hoping tat he wouldn't be able to do the same with this one. It took him a little while longer to get this one off, but he succeeded. However, I do like how easy they are to clean, which is why I gave them 3 stars."
4,Barf catcher,"At the time, we probably fed our daughter too much yam too fast. She ended up barfing it all back up. Fortunately, the bib shape is just right for catching all that barf. A regular bib would have left a mess on the floor."
4,headphones,"they are top quality...heavy duty...i'm not able to use them yet, winter snow, but i'm looking forward to it in the spring..."
5,Headphones,These have been a godsend for my husband! He uses them withhis metal detector and it block out all of the beach noise.
1,broken,i had been looking for a cake plate with a cover since i lost mine when i had a fire in 07 looking on line i saw this one and place my order it came in 2 or 3 days i was happy to see the ups man he hand me the box and right then i want to cry the base of the plate was broken i could not take it out the box it was not packed right i did it over call ups. still looking but in the store this time.
2,Very dissatisfied with video quality,"I used to have a SONY Hi-8 (TRV 87). I think that produced far crisper images than this, supposedly ""digital"" PV-DV 101 from Panasonic. The picture quality here is unexpectedly grainy. Low light recording is awful, even with their low light setting turned on. Once the 20X optical zoom is at its max, digital zoom doesn't kick in automatically. You actually have to hit a digital zoom button to get it on. This can cause an awful interruption in your recording. Also, this camcorder doesn't come with an electric adapter (it is optional and you have to buy it separately). Thumbs down on my behalf. [The still photo shot was impressive, though!]"
3,"Heartbreaking beautiful layouts to, ack!, C#-centric coding.","After looking at the ""classic ASP"" version of this book I eagely awaited the arrival of the ASP.NET version. The diagrams and ""modular"" approach of the book are excellent but I did not learn until it's arrival that the coding would heavily emphasize C# coding as opposed to VB.NET, making it totally useless for me.If your bent is C# I cannot recommend this book enough. If you're a VB.NET kind of person though stick to the Sams book. Sorry guys!"
5,IT WORKS!!,"I got it and I am very satisfied with the EXTREMELY positively results:- Harder erections- 8-15 contractions- Shooting further.- My appetite for sex has doubled- I can stay hard for a long timeAMAZING Stuff! These are some of the result that I have observed so far.Regarding volume increase: Yes, I have seen an increase in volume but only slightly. This is because I have been taking Ogoplex for about a week.I started off by taking 3 pills right after lunch for about 4 days and then on the 5th day I returned to the suggested dosage (1 pill a day with meal). I stared with high dosage only to speed up things.I will update my review after 1 month.In short...GUYZ!! Please do yourself a small favor and get this product."
1,Two cents from a typical human who has truely consumed this product a few times.,"Long story short, my stomach is kind of sensitive to those chemicals like antiseptics, every time I eat something contains too much wrong chemicals, I need to spend about an hour sitting on a toilet the day after that. And yes, after a few time consuming this ""boiled oysters"", those hours of bathroom play convinced me this is the wrong product for health. For the tasty, really not much to say, just like normal canned food.Should I also mention that a few of the metal cans have some oxides outside, look like they are very poorly made and stored. The Best Before dates printed on all cans are all 05/2015(bought on Feb 17, 2012); honestly, I can't believe a true boiled product with not too much chemicals can store for that long, even vacuumed products, can you?The ingredients listed is:Whole Oysters, Water, Salt....."
1,Sprayed with toxic flame retardants!,"Do NOT buy this pillow. It is treated with toxic flame retardants that are neurotoxic, carcinogenic, cause brain development and neurological problems in babies especially dangerous for pregnant women! In fact any time you buy anything foam check for the flame retardants and if the label says meets flammability laws do NOT buy it! I am not happy with Amazon for not disclosing this. Also there are no studies out there that show that fire retardants prevent fires or save lives in fact they do NOT! I am a pharmacist and I actually read clinical trials on this! Anything with foam is potentially sprayed with these so check mattresses baby items pillows and be very careful this stuff is extremely toxic!"
2,Butt cushion,Not recommended for adults.....especially over 80 lbs. These cushions went flat over time and looses its effectiveness . I am 125 lbs and this cushion lasted only two weeks. The fabric covering is a rip off..... All these foam cushions are identically the same. Don't be fooled about the color choices not unless you want to pay more. The cheaper orange rubber cushions that look like a life saver have saved my life. Try to look for the life saver. It really works and lasts longer. Good luck and get well!
3,Generic horror/thriller,"The Bottom Line:A standard, paint-by-numbers ""________ from Hell"" film whose blank is filled by ""roommate"" this time, Single White Female features the occasional creepy moment and a good performance by Jennifer Jason Leigh but five minutes into the film you can pretty much figure out the entire movie's trajectory; don't make time for this middling movie.2.5/4"
1,No Hint of Talent in a Baseless Depiction of Reality by Paranoid Men,"This film was poorly executed based on a mediocre screenplay. This 1992 low budget B movie portrayed a shallow concept with a heartless plan to unfairly depict single females as psycho who have affection for one another while making men out to be deeply caring and misunderstood angelics. This film is a paranoid man's fantasy and take on reality. Someone recommended this to me based on my believing the film Pacific Heights to be a good roommate horror flick. It wasn't anywhere near the quality production of PH, not by a long shot. I regret purchasing this DVD. It was a total waste of money that I would have preferred to donate to the ASPCA. People who think this is a good movie like nudity, S&M, bondage, blood, gore, sex and ugly women with strange haircuts."
5,My 5 year old enjoys Barbie,My 5 year old enjoys Barbie movies and thats all that matters to me. You can usually snag them for around $5 at walmart and such.
3,can be incredibly lame and boring at times...,"it's definitely DEFINITELY not up to par with the earlier barbie films. it does not take my breath away. neither does it captures the magic and the excitement like the earlier ones. i feel that the last three films have been a downgrade like the producers have ran out of ideas. the last really good barbie film was the three musketeers. i felt that it was funny at times with ken...but overall it was just an okay movie. the only good things about this movie were the ending, the theme song, and the moral message about forgiving others will set you free."
5,Granddaughter loves this movie!,"Anything Barbie will work with my granddaughter, but it is nice to be able to go to Amazon and download these onto the computer so they are always available when she visits."
2,Should have kept it a secret,"Of all the Barbie movies, this has to be the worst. My daughter watches Barbie videos endlessly. She was so excited to get this new one, counted down for months....and then was so disappointed. She doesn't even want to watch it a second time. The story is a bit of a stretch, meaningless, the ""animation"" seemed off, and Barbie's newer voice is not our favorite. Stick to the other movies. Keep this one a secret. SHHHHHHH!"
1,Blech,"We have owned this video for over a month, and it's so bad, my 4 year old has only watched it once! I agree with the other reviewers that state this movie is not like the earlier ones. Mattel needs to go back to the days of Diamond Castle and Mermaid Tale. The only good thing in this movie is that Barbie has to save Ken. But that's it."
1,A Vanity Movie,"I agree with a previous reviewer. This movie focuses on boyfriend/girlfriend issues and pure vanity - not what I want my 4.5 year old to watch. I liked the Mermaid Tale, Island Princess, Nutcracker, where the female is a strong lead. Too bad I bought this instead of rented it."
4,Fun Sequel to Fashion Fairytale,"Older fans will not appreciate another modern and fashion-oriented Barbie movie, but for me (a huge fan of the earlier films) this movie was as bright and funny as its predecessor. While the film shows us Barbie Movies at their worst (i.e. Gloss Angeles), it also shows Barbie Movies at their funniest best. Just as he did in Fashion Fairytale, Ken shines in A Fairy Secret. His ways of coping with his compromising situations (he is kidnapped by fairies and forced into a magical duel) are the highlight of the film. My family and I love watching him. Clearly the writers had a lot of fun with this script, and that fun comes through the screen and fills its viewers--as long as they're not busy seething over the loss of Kelly Sheridan and Fairy Tales. I miss the old movies as much as the next person, but these newer ones are not entirely without their charm and laughter =)"
5,An entertaining and educational read,"As a former Latin student, I think Tres Mures Caeci is an excellent introduction to Latin, especially for children. This entertaining expansion of a classic nursery rhyme follows the adventures of three blind mice named Unhappy, Wretched, and Content, and teaches children a lesson in character. The layout is pleasing, featuring large illustrations (with an Ancient Roman twist) to match every page of simple, large print text. A helpful English translation and glossary of Latin terms are included at the end of the book. Whether the reader is a Latin scholar or has no background in the language, this book would be a wonderful addition to home and school (especially classical school) libraries."
5,Splendid!,"The DVD is first-rate. This is not eels music that all will be familiar with, but it's not supposed to be. The strings are beautiful, Chet and the other guy play more instruments (or variations of instruments) than Mike Oldfield on horse tranquilizers and E sounds great. You can tell he's having a blast, and for him to have fun is not always so easy.If you are looking for a greatest hits concert, this isn't it. What it is, however, is a splendid collection of great songs in an intimate setting. One song I particularly loved is Pretty Ballerina, the old Left Banke song.Nicely done, Mark Oliver Everett aka ""E"" and the rest of the strings and band. A++++++"
3,"To infinity, and beyond","Godspeed's debut was an interesting far cry away from the precise celestial attacks they would flesh out on subsequent outings. These rural, idea-intensive sketches flow by underwhelming when put in a three part context, but do indeed contain enough committed existential dread paired with minimalist melody to indicate why the committed collective would continue to sonically rattle many compositional cages."
5,Eargasim from this dark beauty,"I can only imagine how difficult it must be to create an album with such imagery without lyrics, Godspeed pull's this off and then some. the jet black labels leaves your wondering what your about to listen to, this leaves your with a feeling uncertainty and anticipation. no matter witch side the needle drop on first your pulled in. True it is not the most musically talented album in the world but it is this albums simplicity that makes is so captivating and beautiful. (I'll say that for any Goodspeed album) The loops and builds this album delivers along with the chilling monologue's leaves your wanting more in a good way, You will not be unfulfilled. This is one of those albums that is meant to be listened to on vinyl and nothing else."
4,Not For A Mix Tape!,"Explanations don't come easy for music such as this, neither for context, or emotion, and for the most part if you heard a section of this album, and not the whole thing, it probably would'nt make much sense, or get played again. However given the time, and given the chance GSYBE will take you somewhere, sometimes it's something that you did'nt want to feel, but hell, why else would people listen to something so beautifully sad. Life was'nt meant to be perfect, and if you believe that then this album is."
4,Why bother with a more expensive model?,"This unit is among the lowest-cost mini-DV camcorder that you can buy. I went with it for the price, but found that it isso easy to use, you don't even need the instruction manual.Superbly engineered for compact size, light weight, and intuitive ergonomics. Auto focus, zoom, light adjustments, all work transparently. My only gripe is the short life of theincluded battery, and the cumbersome AC/DC adapter."
1,derivative,"Silver's compositions are derivative to say the least. First of all, the solo piano works are hack job reworkings of Debussy. The piano concerto is a boring mishmosh of scales and textures, again derrivative of French impressionism, romanticism, and Bartok. In fact, the last movement even rips off a tune from Bartok. Don't waste your time with this - why not listen to the original sources."
5,Excellent!!! Definitely should read.,This book was so good that I had to read it over and over again.
4,Silent to the Bone,"Silent to the Bone was very well written. I found it to be somewhat childish. I think the author tried to make the book suspenseful but instead it was just a little slow for something to happen. Yet the whole time I honestly did want to know exactly what would happen to one of the main characters, Branwell. Silent to the Bone shows friendship while being a mystery type of book. There is excitement when you get to parts when you think the detective mystery is about to unfold, yet then you seem to just have to keep reading because something new happens. I would say this book isn't a difficult read and is meant for a mature teenager or younger adult. I think if you are looking for an easy read that is enjoyable you should read Silent to the Bone."
5,it was a goooooooood book,i'm crazy and i liked the book.it was very good. but there could have been more evil dragons.its exciting and intresting.some parts the book is even funny.conner and branwell are like the bestest friends ever.it tought me about true friends and help me connect with my friend s in a different way.i wouid'nt reccomend this book to any one under the age of 10.
4,Another brill young student?,"This book almost disappointed me. Although it is very humorous at points, the un-suspense didn't kill me. I really should stop reading the last chapter first. What's with the love of the town of Epiphany? The View From Saturday was set there too! The book moved too slowly for me, and the ending was terrible. Maybe a sequel to liven it up? And what happens to Vickie?"
5,Awesome Again!,This is a fantastic book! I couldn't put it down. You want to know everything that happened that fatefull night! You'll end up hating Vivian and rooting for Branwell to speak! I definitely recommend this one!
1,Overrated,I was very disappointed in this book. I find it hard to believe that this book is on the reading list for middle school students. It read like a trashy novel or tabloid news. The sexual innuendos were very inappropriate for this age group. We continue to complain as a society about inappropriate youth behavior and yet we continue to expose them to inappropriate content. What can we expect to get? Middle school students are embarrassed and appalled that they are reading this book as assigned reading. It should be the book they are sneaking around to read.
5,I plan to take them with me when I go,"This is the ultimate comfort reading material. No matter how depressing this world gets, an evening with Larson always brings a smile back to my face. You can keep fame and fortune; when I die I want to take these books with me to the Far Side."
5,Far Side Best,When I saw the Complete Far Side on the Deal of the Day I was very happy. I had seen it in retail at a discounted price but the price on Amazon was much better. I enjoy opening up one of the volumes and randomly reading the cartoons. It is great.
4,"Unique Perspective @ insects, scientists and life","After years of glancing at Far Side from the Library and the occasional Newspaper, this collection is a highly valued addition to the few personal posessions that I hope a few of my descendents or friends will appreciate."
5,They do hurt,"Djhexane is entirely right, this bookset also fell on my foot at work. Trust me you do not want to drop this thing, probably go right through your floor, it ways about 60 pounds it is really heavy. But thats a good thing, you see it being really heavy means there is alot of quality that comes with it extremely heavy quantity. I would probably buy this for my dad, if it wasn't so expensive. I know my dad loves the far side, but 135 bucks he would probably get mad at me for spending so much rather than thank me for the entire collection."
5,The Complete Far Side 1980-1994 (2 Vol set),I feel very lucky to own possibly the best set of humerous cartoons I have ever seen. Thankyou to the publishers for compiling this wonderful set.
4,The Far Side collection,"Having always been a fan of the Far Side, this was well worth the purchase and my wife and I have enjoyed laughing together. My only complaint are the many, many blasphemous cartoons where God is the butt of the joke. It is also annoying that there are so many cartoons promoting evolution. So discernment is needed."
1,Way too heavy,"Ok, I admit I am weak. But this thing is way too heavy.Don' even think of bringing it on an airplane.Buy an IPAQ."
4,This is a high quality set,"I love these comics.Not only are all the great comics here, but the producton quality of these two books is Phenomenal. If the price was a little lower I would recommend this set to everyone. If you love Gary Larson's sense of humor like I do then streching for these books is worth it."
5,A Must have for Far Side Fans,"I laughed when the cartoons were new, and I am still laughing at them. Gary Larson had a rare gift for creating humor that could border on the bizarre, but was always novel and fresh. The cartoons are arranged by the year they were first published. The only downside is the heft of the volumes, so they don't make easy bed time reading."
1,total waste of time,"I married an only child and together we have an only child, so I thought this book would be a good support for raising one, but it's not. The author is only interested in promoting career oriented working women, and their husbands, who don't want to sacrifice any more of their time than they have to. There's basically nothing in the book about loving and raising an only child. There are plenty of opinions stated as fact and a subtle push to erase the traditional definition of marriage and family."
2,Usual pop psychology junk,"I'm often reluctant to purchase these psychology books because they're so poorly written, take 30 pages to say what can be said in 1 paragraph, ramble, and have few words of wisdom contained in them. I do try because I find even if I have to skim a lot of junk, there's sometimes some helpful advice and it's often good to know that there are other people with the same questions out there. I'm not sure that paying $15 for the privilige is worth it, however.I would instead recommend You and Your Only Child by Nachman, which I bought at the same time and I found infinitely more helpful."
5,"Spectactular album, but quality control issues","The brilliance of the album and bonus material goes without saying. The mastering is impeccable. Yet like others here, I had difficulty getting a correct CD set. My first order had the Exodus packaging, but the actual CDs inside were for Legend. The replacement set was closer: the second CD was Exodus, but the first CD was missing entirely.In this case, third time was the charm. I obviously don't hold Amazon responsible for the contents of a shrink-wrapped package--and they were great about the returns--but Island Def Jam needs to pay serious attention to their quality control."
4,Excellent.....Music for the people,"What is often called his strongest synthesis may be a little too synthesized for purists but pound-for-pound stands as high as any other release from himself and in such, the genre."
1,Reggae is not good...,"I tried heroically to listen to reggae music, so I went for the best: Bob Marley, and bought this CD. With all due respect to the late Marley, this kind of music is totally boring and repetitive. I didn't enjoy it at all, I passed my CD ahead to a friend of mine. Really weak tunes. To say this is ""rock"" is a heresy."
3,"Has vocals, which I didn't realize",Had I researched this before I purchased it I probably would have simply bought the instrumental I heard from it. There are a bunch of vocal tracks which I didn't want.
3,Be Prepared,"Just note when ordering you will receive 48 bottles. Not in the display box, but 48 separate bottles with some bubble wrap on top."
4,Guaranteed To Put You In The Christmas Spirit!,"This album is in frequent rotation of my more than one hundred Christmas albums. I first bought this ten years ago on cassette and just last week spent 99-cents on a cut-out CD version. [Evidently it was re-released in 2000 on the K-tel label.] This music is soulful, majestic, uplifting...and funky! Listen to their rousing version of ""Children Go"" or the pull-out-all-the-stops rendition of ""Away in a Manger."" It's impossible to sit still while you're listening to this. Executive producers are Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, who produced ""Soul Holidays"" and ""It's Christmas Time."" If you're looking for a break from the umpteenth playing of ""White Christmas,"" this album is guaranteed to ward off the Christmas Blues. RECOMMENDED"
3,Fun But doesn't Work!,I used it for a while on my Mac laptop (with it freezing every now and then) but then I got a new INTEL MacBook Laptop and it would not work on the New OS Operating systems!!!!
4,CHEAP PLASTIC!!!!!,"People! Read the label! It says that the plastic is a cenisthetic ""Dempontoxide"" mixed in. This is a major ingredient in Plastic that is MEANT to be broken! It is widley used in Karate ""Breaking"" supplies. One more thing! Look at the grey plastic in the Card Holders. See the swirls? IT'S WARPED!! it occurs when ""Dempontoxide"" is exposed to heat and this, renders the plastic , weakend further. Besides this and if Mattel gave a darn about their products, this would be a great item"
5,yugioh,I THINK THAT THIS TOY WOULD BE FUN FOR ALL KIDS THAT ENJOY YUGIOH TRADING CARD GAME OVER THE WORLD I THINK THAT THIS IS THE BEST CARD GAME IN THE IN WORLD.
5,i love it,this thing is so cool!! i love the automatic duel mode button i highly recommend this because it is not a high price and it is worth it! i bet your kids would love you if you bought this for them i am allmost a teen and i love it!! i also like howdurable it is. the damage calculation meter doo hikie is cool i think only a schlummie would hate it.thank you for making it and god bless.P.S.another reason to buy it is because i tells you what the card does i LOVE IT!!!!
5,Rare Hunter,Beware all dulest once I get my hands on one of those duel disks say good bye to all your rare cards
4,Good Toy,This toy is cool but the bad thing is that it is dangerous. The two parts that go together to connect it are dangerous. Its a gilloutine basically and I think thats not a good part of it.
4,The Duel Disk Launcher is very cool,"The Duel Disk launcher is a fun toy. I had fun playing with it but when I bought the Duel Disk Launcher, it broke (the part where it transforms broke). So I packed it up and took it back to Toy's R Us. They were all out of stock on Duel Disk Launchers for a month. Finally, I got another one but right when I opened it the part where it transforms broke again. So that's why I gave it such a low durability grade. It's only a little educational because of the life points - it helps kids with their math."
1,This Toy Stinks like a piece of Old Cheese,"This toy is a piece of junk. It does not function properly, and sometimes did not even work at all. It is pointless, and has no value to any child whatsoever. If I could have rated it ""0 Stars"" I would have, but alas that was not an option. Save your money, do not spend it on this junk. It would be a waste of money. Also, as everyone knows, YuGiOh is just plain stupid and rejected."
5,IT'S TIME TO DUEL LIKE A PRO.,I got my duel disk for christmas. And my brother got one to. Now we dont have to fight over were to duel now we can duel anywere. It's your move!
5,the duel disk,I love the duel disk it allows to duel anytime anywhere. I gave it 4 stars because the yu-gi-oh trading card game is a lot math. It features a life point counter(manual) and a slide-out feild card zone. No it does not project holograms.
1,And how heavy is it???,"Hi,I'm an experienced Yu-Gi-Oh player and thought that this toy would allow me to duel with out a table, however I found that the duel disk was extremely heavy (unless you lift weights that is, you will find that as well).I also found to my displeasure that I had to take all my cards out of their deck protector sleeves (I mean we're talking ultra rare cards here), so I decided to take my duel disk back. The deck holder is also small and the graveyard is tiny... but the later shouldn't matter if you're a good duelist.If you lift weights and don't care about your cards it's a good toy, if not... and you like to keep your cards in good condition don't get it."
2,Yu-gi-oh Duel Disk Launcher - Doesn't deliver that much fun,"The Yu-gi-oh duel disk launcher was a ""must have"" for my six-year-old son this Christmas. Santa delivered the toy as expected, but the toy didn't deliver the fun! The duel disk launcher is nothing more than a storage place for yu-gi-oh cards. The only ""special"" feature is the light up counter. I researched this product thoroughly prior to purchasing it, and thought it would offer many more options. It is over-priced for what you get. I would not recommend this toy."
5,TIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this thing is off the chain!! i mean if it wasnt for matel creating this thing kids all around the world would still be board with the mat.(boring)any yu-gi-oh friend would want this!the only problem is that it is held up with a wrist band!!! that makes it losse and wobbly. thats why i gave the durable a 3. could you fix that? but besides that it rocks out loud!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,THE DUEL DISK IS THE BEST!!!!!!! I HAVE IT!,HELLO ITS ME THE MASTER AND THIS TOY IS THE BEST PRESENT FOR CHRISTMAS. I ORDERED MINE FROM GETCOLLECTING.COM. IF AMAZON IS STILL SOLD OUT GET A DUEL LAUNCHER FROM GETCOLLECTING. DONT WORRY THEIR DUEL DISKS ARENT FAKE LIKE THE STUPID FAKE JAPENSE VERSION. I HAVE 50 CARDS SO I SHOULDNT HAVE A PROBLEM. PLUS I CAN DUEL MY FREINDS IN THE DUELING ARENA I BUILT IN MY BACKYARD. SO I HAVE 5 WORDS TO SAY. GET THIS TOY FOR CHRSITMAS!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Great idea, needs to be more durable.","This dual disk was an awesome idea. My son really loved to play with it. But now we have purchased 2 within one year and both of them have broken. It is not a durable toy. The part that held the cards got stressed, cracked and then finally just broke off. No way to fix it. Too heavy for the plastic material. My son loves Yu-Gi and the dual disk, but the quality and durablility for the price was not up to expectations. If your child is hard on toys, you might want to consider this review."
5,AP Calculus Teacher Recommends this book for Students,"I have been teaching AP Calculus for more years than I am willing to admit. Whenever I have a student who says, ""I need more practice problems"" or ""I'm just not getting this"" or ""Is there ANYthing you can do to help me?"" I ALWAYS recommend this book.Some of my students just use it at the end of the year to review, but others use it during the year as a supplemental text.Yes, even the best of teachers sometimes can't deliver the message in a way that EVERY student understands. That's why Mike Kelley's book is so helpful.Buy it. Your brain will thank you."
3,Blue bits everywhere,"We got this because the Amazon was out of the nylabone dinosaur chew. The dog likes it ok, but unlike the dinosaur, when he chews on it, little bits of blue are dropped everywhere. Annoying. Price is right, though."
4,Perfect chew toy for my little dog,"My dog really likes the Nylabone (Blue) Dental Chew. I've never experienced a problem with her use of it in all the years I've been getting it for her. The nubs on the surface of this chew toy massage the gums and the salivation promoted by it helps clean the teeth.As with all dog chew toys, you should periodically check to see how your dog is doing with it. Any chew toy fragment swallowed (no matter what type of chew it may be) can suddenly become stuck in the throat or intestinal tract.(I did not give it 5 stars because it's not made from a natural material.)However, I am very disappointed in the price tag from Amazon: as of this review, the regular size (4-1/2"") is sold for $5.49, but you can get it through Drs. Foster & Smith Pet Supplies for $2.99 -- I discovered this AFTER I'd placed my Amazon order. Amazon and its merchants know they can sell it for less and should be competitive with their prices."
3,KD Tools (KD 3164) Inner CV Joint Pullers for Slide Hammer,"KD Tools (KD 3164) Inner CV Joint Pullers for Slide Hammer a good idea design but most of the time there is not enough clearance to get it behind the axel, great idea and design just doesn`t work on all applications. No reflection on amazon."
1,Don't buy this!,"What a ripoff! I give it one star just because they shipped the correct fuse and did so pretty quick. However, the picture clearly shows SIX fuses - they sent a blister pack of TWO! Second - read the fine print - I didn't. They charge almost $7.50 for S&H PLUS they sent it insured!!! That's right, insurance on a product worth $1.65! Since I wasn't home when the mail came, I wasted a trip to the P.O. just to get my two fuses. Third - if you want these fuses, truck on over to Ace Hardware - you can get a FIVE pack for $2.69 plus tax instead of the $9.13 I spent for two. Grrrrr...."
5,THIS IS A CAMERA,"i dont know what the guy befor me wanted but this is a camera NOT a VCR, but if u REALLY want to put ur analog tapes on ur computer or camera, then buy a SONY VCR with an I-link or IEEE 1394 compatibitily. I am more than an ameture videographer, i do alot of DV editing, and this camera has ALL the features that i need, its I-link IN/OUT compatibility makes for an easy hook up to your PC (if u have a fire wire card), a remote controle, and several Picture effects as well as some digital effects, including oldmovie, and u can superimose a nother picture onto a live feed."
3,"Great framework, poor book","Creating an enterprise OO framework with the flexibility of CSLA is no easy task. No doubt, Rocky knows his stuff and has thought through it very well and invested serious amounts of time, effort, and energy. Some companies spend millions to develop this type of architecture. HOWEVER, The book spends a lot of time on theory and the ""what"", but almost no time on the ""HOW"". If he gave more real world examples, instead of code snipits here-and-there, this framework would be complete. The book doesn't walk a user through the process of actually building something useful. It just explain stuff in discreet, seemingly unrelated chapters.Good technology. Poor book to explain it. If it would walk a user through actually building a working project it would be much better."
1,Very Disappointing,"The previous books in this series would walk you through creating the CSLA framework yourself. With plain instructions, such as ""create a new file called x.vb and add the following code to it.""The book would walk you through creating the framework, explaining it to you, step by step. That was a great way to learn.This book (and the VB.NET counterpart) simply want you to download the code, and the book discusses the highlights. Ugh.I was really counting on this book to help me become more familliar with C# (I'm a VB.NET guy mostly), while at the same time learning about 2.0, AND get the latest CSLA under my belt.Wrong Wrong Wrong."
4,Perfect part for my needs,Product was sent in a timely manner and worked perfectly once placed in the PC. Thanks!
4,Great for do it yourself hair cuts,"This may be obvious to some, but read the little booklet that tells you how to cut hair before you take these clippers to your little one's head. I had no idea there was a piece designed specifically for the ears (brilliant!). I sure wish I had known that before my husband gave our son a mini mullet around the ears. I'm pretty positive his next hair cut will look better. Overall, the clippers work great and the kit gives me more than everything I need. After two or three cuts it buys itself (and maybe by then I'll even be good at it)."
2,worked well then broke,"These clippers were great at first, after 2 cuts they became EXTREMELY LOUD. They must have broke as they were not this loud before. I am going to return them and try another pair, hopefully this time they will be ok."
3,OK,"Clipper works well, nicely designed, but how the Pro in the name came to be is beyond me. The small battery operated extra unit does not have blade adjustment settings and the main cutting clipper is not particularly sharp. However, it's worked, for personal use, but nothing greater than average. Truly a case of 2.5 rating."
4,Pretty decent product,"I've had probably 3 or 4 other clippers in my life and this one ranks up there with the best. I've had it for a couple of months and so far it's worked well. Cuts very well without pulling hair. The only issue that I've had with it is that sometimes when using the short attachments, it's difficult to blend hair (make a nice, even transition from shorter to longer hair). Maybe I'm just not used to using this one yet, who knows? But all in all, it's done a good job."
2,S-Trimmer is Worthless,"The big clippers are sturdy as you would expect and do a good job, the little battery powered S-clipper however is about the same quality you would expect to buy at the dollar store. I can't believe Wahl put their name on this piece of junk. It slows and even comes to a stop depending on you hold it. Maybe buy the Wahl clippers but avoid the S-clippers if you can."
4,good clippers,"good clippers, they are kinda heavy, at least from what i'm used to, but no big deal...it would hurt if you dropped it on your foot. Hubby and boys like them, they don't pull their hair, lots of attachments, but no separate bag for them, overall, good though!"
4,It wasn't the item that I was looking for,"This hair cutting item was very nice, but it wasn't the one I wanted. Good for styles with different clippers and trimmers."
4,Great set.,I am very satisfied with this purchase; I love that I get two clippers and a variety of length-attachments. I haven't had any problems with it whatsoever. I'm sold.
3,So LOUD!!!,"Definitely a great set of clippers and attachments that come in a convenient storage case, but the only thing that isn't included is a set of ear plugs. When I first used the clippers (as well as each subsequent use), I was amazed at how extremely loud they were. Thankfully, I had a pair of foam ear plugs and now I wear them each time I use the clippers. I shouldn't have to, but that is all that makes using the clippers bearable. Quality product, just way too loud."
2,"Average model, ""Deluxe Chrome Pro"" misleading",The unit arrived in good shape with all included items. While this offering by Wahl does have a few more included items overall its the same Wahl trimmer that can be had at around $20 here on Amazon and at most discount stores. The 'powerful' motor sounds and acts exactly like a $20 model we have had for a year.If you are looking for a more robust or capable model by Wahl this is not the one you will want to purchase.
5,Great value!,"Bought this set for my son who is always stealing my husband's 20 year old Wahl clippers. Since those still worked so well, I chose the Wahl brand over the others. My son loves them and it's a great value for the package. Couldn't find anything like this in the store."
1,laughable,"I have owned a dozen or so clippers over the years. This is the most I have ever paid for the lowest quality. The previous one I bought cost $13 and lasted five years, it was the same size as a professional clipper. I saw this kit and thought I was in for a treat. The clipper is about 60% as big as I am used to. The guards are very flimsy. The oil dispenser broke as the plastic container is a micron thick. The 'mirror' is like a barbie toy, seriously.... silver paint on a mirror shaped plastic base? silver paint =/= mirror. I will never buy a wahl product ever again. Anyone saying this is four or five stars, I saw one say ""Just Like the Pros""... you have never seen another clipper or you are being paid to post reviews. This is a ridiculous piece of garbage. At least I got a really good laugh at the 'mirror'"
3,alittle disapointed,"the machines are great(big and small one). but i have a problem with the plastic accessories(mostly the detachable combs for the machine), most are too big and they are damaged from the machine easily. if they were metal it would have been prefect.the big one is a bit noisy, but i can live with that for now. great product though."
3,work good but VERY LOUD !,These clippers came with nice attachments and a nice bag. They work good but wow they are loud.
2,POORLY MADE,I have always used Wahl products and always had good experiences. I used this once with no problem. The second time I used it the thing would begin to vibrate out of control making an extremely loud high pitched sound. I would have to slap it against my palm to to get it to stop and sometimes it took a couple of whacks. After I took it apart and learned that the vibrator is made out of cheesy plastic. The piece just barely went through the slot and had enough play to slip out. I tightened the screws as tight as I could but it kept happening. Sometimes if you adjust the slide it will stop.The thing is pretty quiet when it works correctly but when that plastic piece slips out and it makes that loud vibrating nose it scares the crap out of you.I still use it and put up with it as I didn't save my reciept. I would avoid this one. Maybe Wahl has a better model. Even if you have to pay more for the better model it will be worth it as this one is not that good at all.
1,Not what I expected,"I bought this for my husbands birthday and was very excited for him to use. Once he turned it on it was SO LOUS I could not even hear my DOG bark. My dog was barking at the LOUD vibrating sound, to top it off my husband couldnt even cut his hair with it because it was vibrating so much he could not keep a steady hand. What toppe dit off we smelled a BURNT smell. It was horrible we would never buy this brand again."
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed at the quality of this product. The clipper attachments were flimsy and bent from side to side when in use requiring you to stop and straighten them out. Also the clipper just didn't cut that well. Compared to my old clipper the quality and evenness of the cut was very poor. I returned the product
4,Making it Right,"Wasn,t what I thought it was. I thought it was U.S.Marshal but it was just Marshal.It was my fault but these people refunded my money and let me keep the shirt too!Excellent and Super Customer Service!"
5,British Comedy at its most anarchic,British Comedy at its most anarchic.Some of the minor celebrities who are duped into saying ridiculous things may not be all that well known in the USA but i'm sure there's still plenty to savour.
3,A good introduction,"This is a well written book, but it is somehow disappointing. For the begginers in the study of Darwin, if you don't care about the constant repetitions in this book."
1,"Couldn't even finish it, unfortunately","I join the ranks of those who didn't care for this book. I got about halfway through and finally decided not to waste any more time. The dialogue was trite, to say the least, and the plot nonexistent. I was looking for historical fiction, but this book really belongs in the Romance section. The Black Prince and the rest of the Plantagenets are fascinating characters, and they deserve better."
3,First Princess of Romance,"This book is a quick read and borders on harlequin romance, but the characters have more depth. I find the storyline to be unoriginal (ie, so many other historical romances seem to be about a strong-willed, beyond-beautiful girl who falls in love with and is loved by, a prince.) It is entertaining and well-written though. Recommended for historical fiction fans who appreciate romance rather than history."
1,Disappointing,"This book is a shallow, melodramatic and overly romantic portrait of Joan of Kent. She has written Joan (and the other characters) as if they were modern people motivated by modern concerns. For a better fictional portrait of the court of Edward III, read KATHERINE by Anya Seton. An easy-to-read non-fictional portrait of the era is A DISTANT MIRROR by Barbara Tuchman. Don't waste your time on this one."
2,Big disappointment,"I purchased this book to learn to do DOM programming, not to use the code provided by the authors. I was hoping for clear examples, instead I got a book that expects me to download their sample code or type it all in (and there is ALOT) in order to easily follow the samples. Typically this would be fine, but a majority of the functions and classes you can download are poorly explained, or not explained at all. This book is more like instructions on how to use a lot of code written by the authors to manipulate XML.I own two other WROX books, these book were easy to follow and gave just the right amount of code to get me going. This book does neither. Big disappointment."
2,You can get a better book,"I only wanted to know a couple of things related to XML well: working with the DOM and XSLT. Other things like Xlink, XPointer etc.. are yet really to be defined practically and face it folks - we will be married to implementations of the future. I would tell anyone getting this book to reconsider and check out the Dietel & Dietel XML How to Program book. Sure the samples are in Java, Perl, ASP and VB, but you should be able to figure things out AND they do a much better job with XSLT and DOM."
4,Good and Bad,"When I first got this game in Wal Mart for $9.99, I was really excited about getting to build my own cruise ship. But when I started it up for the first time, I couldn't figure out even how to lower the decks. There is no tutorial so you have to figure out how to play on your own. The guests always find ways to make your cruise ship seem bad. You have to build 1000 rooms to get 1000 people on board your cruise ship. Buy this game if you are interested in a challenge."
2,Dull as dishwater.,"By this time, the time being 1980, Steeleye Span were done. There ability to take centuries old British folk songs and interpret them through a rock vein seemed exhuasted. This uninspired sounding recording is marred by weak song selection, uncharacteristically tepid musicianship and slick production. Stick with any of their 70's recordings avoid all that came after as the magic got lost...Simon"
4,Uplifting,"I found this easy-to-read book touching. As the author recounts her own experiences, some depressing and downbeat, she comes through each one focused and positive. The reader cannot help but admire Amy even if a particular passage or chapter does not relate to them. This book is full of simple, though sound advice for the reader as we each embark on our own journey to happiness."
3,Great photo survey on flight jackets,"The title of this work is a bit of s mis-nomer. Webster's defines history as a ""chronological record of significant events (as affecting a nation or institution) often including an explanation of their causes."" The only part of that definition met is that the photos of flight jackets are presented in chronological order from the First World War to the Gulf Wars. There is no attempt to describe why or how the designs were arrived at for the various types of jackets depicted.On the other hand, the photographs are absolutely magnificent. If you own a repro jacket of any of the types shown - the A-2 dominates to be sure - then this book is an excellent style-guide."
3,Crisp artwork and compelling stories,"Chronological reprints of Amazing Spider-Man from 1967-1969, when the artwork (by John Romita, Sr.) never looked better and the stories(by Stan Lee) were never more involving -- even the supporting characters and sub-plots are well-rounded and interesting. One minor criticism -- although the reprints seem complete (20 pps), some of the pages are obviously copied from Marvel Tales (a Spider-Man reprint book which printed EDITED stories). Also, the pages would look much better in color -- and some of the cover pages are sloppily reproduced bigger than the page can fit. Still probably the cheapest way to read these great comics."
3,Killer storm,"This is a history of the great storm that paralyzed much of the Northeast, especially NYC, in March 1888. It started out as rain, then quickly and fiercely changed to snow. The snow piled up quickly; when the temperature plummeted, much of the snow turned to ice. The wind was wicked. I think worse storms might have hit since then, but this one was a killer: hundreds died. It also was the impetus for building the NYC subway system. Definitely a YA book without a whole lot of depth to it."
5,Great for Visual Learners,All of the Maran books are great for visual learners and those new to the computer. I taught out of them for senior citizens new to computer skills and the feedback was very positive.
3,"Historic performances, but historic sound, too","The reviewer below who calls this good sound must be listening to records through a paper cup. These BBC broadcasts from 1951-56 feature a deceont-sounding Harold in Italy from an Edinbrugh Festival concert (annoyingly full of coughs), but even here the solo viola sounds whiny and dim, and the other items are in dreadful sound that is boxy and shrill. After releasing several better-sounding concerts from Beecham, BBC Legends bowed to public demand for his live Berlioz. But these performances don't justify the sonic cost. Violist Frederic Riddle can be painfully out of tune, and although Beecham's orchestral reading of Harold in Italy is exuberant, we have a classic studio recording from him with William Primrose. In fact, this whole CD duplicates material that is either better performed by Beecham or better sounding, so I can't drum up much enthusiasm for it unless you are a die-hard fan."
5,Ahead Of Its Time,"All I can say is ""Thank God"" for this product. I have used it with 100% success over the last year and can say with conviction that this product is designed with intelligence and is very much ahead of its time. Not to mention, the customer service you get with it is top quality! My two cats use this cat box without any problems, and I'm happy to say that no matter what the consistency of #2 in it, LitterFree consistently breaks it down so that all I need to do is flush the toilet. For anyone with a busy schedule, this product is SO worth the money you pay for it! And my house doesn't smell like cats live here at all."
4,Bradford VS the Bugs,"This is an interesting little chiller, much more cerebral and psychological than most people expect. It is notable mainly for the intense performance by Bradford Dillman. He really gives it his all and his portrait of crumbling sanity is compelling."
3,"Hey, that's Marcia Brady's house!","Yes, this 70's killer bug movie was filmed in the Brady houshold after they moved out. I love these schlocker's from this time period. It's been reviewed very well, and I just wanted to add that it's loads of fun. Too bad they don't make them like this anymore."
5,A very in depth and informative guide.,"Fly Idaho contains information and color pictures on just about every dirt strip in Idaho, from fun to almost un-landable. Each page contains a large color Photo, airport diagrams, reccomended procedures, in-depth history, things to do and places to see.New 1998 version now available. More strips and updated info."
5,great mouse!,"I'll admit it - I care WAY more about good looks than functionality. I know I shouldn't, but I can't help it so whatever. The great thing about this mouse is that it has both - it's an eye catcher and it's solid. I've thrown it in my back pack with a bunch of other crap and it's taken a beating - and still working (and looking) great!"
4,Macally USB Optical Mouse Review,"Mouse works fine as does all the Macally products I've purchased in the past. My only comment, and it's not really a complaint, is that their products usually look too toy'ish."
4,Don't Forget Copies,"I took this camera on a trip to NYC. I chose to take the Sony because I was not going to be near my PC for a week, and could not ""download"" the images I captured. I simply took along several floppy disks, and was all set.One neat feature of this camera is that you can make copies of the disks. If you are with friends or family, you can pass out copies to them right away!I recommend this camera."
2,Too Much Like a Junky True Crime Book,"I like nonfiction, and some true crime books are good nonfiction. So, although this book's title makes it sound like junky true crime, I read it. I should have trusted my impression of the book's title.This book bored me.Perhaps if it had stressed more the lack of response from the navy or law enforcement, it might have been more interesting. But the reason that occurred (or I should say ""didn't occur"") would have taken more research, more interviews with more people. Instead, the author stressed what the rapist's wife endured, and the lack of response from the navy and police was not examined, only reported.In-depth descriptions are more interesting than half-descriptions of kinky sex and bad marriage."
5,More Raves From Daddy Rollin' Stone!,"While the Beatles and the Byrds were hitting the main stage; meanwhile Back in garage land the long, shaggy-haired, pre-Mansonite hipsters were trying to impress Mary Jane with the cave stomping send -ups in their best Kieth Relfian manner! Ahhh, sit back, drop a tab and relax!"
2,Disappointing,"Although the instruction was clear, this video was very disappointing. The mixed content (i.e. waltz, foxtrot, and swing) does not lend itself well to an instructional tape. A better choice would be to purchase tapes which focus on each dance. Additionally, I've never encountered the basic East Coast Swing step that Cal teaches; it is unique."
4,pros and cons,"Have been using about a week. had to put in a spray bottle because its very runny, i couldnt see dippin my fingers in over and over & not make a mess! Im already almost out. the smell is horrid! BUT.. It does die down pretty quick if u dont use too much. Other than that, it makes my hair(Im molloto, half white, half black)soft shiny with just the right amount of curl and it really cut down frizz. My goal was wash and wear hair and this does it! I use a medium amount, mostly on scalp & a little on hair itself then brush through,put in a ponytail or bun & sleep in it then wash and wear! Before laying on my pillow i take a towel and wipe off excess oil blotting hair and ive had no problem with staining pillowcases. It will permanently stain clothing, as i found out the first use when i used way too much! But no problems since. will definately buy again or try similar products!"
4,LOVE this oil,"I bought this product 3 months back. I don't write reviews until i use it for sometime. So far i LOVE this product. I have a bald spot in the front. The spot is filling up with usage of this oil. It has made my hair THICK very THICK from fine and damaged. It needs to be used as directed. Unless its used like that you can see no results. I am indian my hair is black. My hair has never felt so soft, shiny and black before. Will definitely repurchase. In fact I am thinking of stocking up !"
2,This stuff stinks,"I found that not only does it smell bad, but I had to keep washing my pillow cases. So far, I see absolutely no difference."
3,"Half a band, half an album","This band is basically two independant artists who have songs and different approaches on the album. I have to say this album is worht buying solely for Mick Moss's songs. This guy is the only talent in this album, he should really consider going solo and putting out his own material. The rest of the songs are song by some female and written by Pattersen. The music is electrinica minimalist garbage. Not to mention the singer is just god-awful and sounds like she will surely kill herself at the end of the song, not to mention the poor songwiting. I could have played those songs with a keyboard and I can't play anything. Seeing the other reviews apperently other people like that also. So I give half the songs 5 stars and the other half 1 star."
1,A silly book masquerading as a mystery,"This book, advertised as ""noir"" mystery/thriller has a shallow and highly improbable as well as very convoluted plot. It hinges on interactions between a depressed attorney, a sexy restaurant hostess, a sick client, a Chinese chef and some off-the-wall mobsters. While this mix may sound potentially attractive it is based on some ubelievable suppositions, lousy editing and even contains spelling errors (""hyperbolic for 'hyperbaric'). I kept waiting for some satisfactory ending but it never came, just a shoddy tying-together of too many variables that never reached a believable level. Save your money."
4,An interesting and enjoyable yarn,"This is the first Colin Harrison book for me. Other reviewers obviously prefered some of his earlier efforts and this book relatively satisfying as it was will give me good cause to give them a try.This book is actually fairly good tale told reasonably well. I do not agree that it is a worthy literary attempt, but rather a journeyman endeavor - a good one at that.Other have suggested that the story line is improbable. I didn't consider it so at all. While somewhat convoluted I found it credible nontheless.The author's insights into his characters was illuminating and interesting, but he sometimes reached too far in attempting to cast all mankind in his own image.Though not a great book I feel that it was a worthy undertaking that all in all made for an enjoyable read.Bill Wyeth, the protagonist, was an extremely sympathetic character as was the other major character, Jay Rainey."
