2,Too big for my apples!,"I guess we have small apples where I am from, because this corer and divider were huge in comparison."
3,Not Big Enough For Large Apples,If you regularly buy large apples then you'll be disappointed. If the diameter of the cutting area was an inch larger it would be fine.
1,Cheaply Made,This apple slicer lasted through 2 apples before coming apart in my hands. I would not recommend this item to anyone.
1,Don't Bother,This brush didn't last a month. The bristles are too soft and become deformed. I last used it when I steamed cleaned my barbeque grill and then tossed it.
1,The Things They Forget To Mention....,Another listener had the good sense to write in that this CD is INSTRUMENTAL.That should be mentioned. I almost bought it and would have been very upset that I had wasted my money. Thank you other listener. You wrote in on my birthday. You saved me some money. Good present.
2,This unit is capable of killing your data,"I own 3 of these units, and they cause me nothing but trouble.2 are plugged in at my home computer and 1 is at my office for my laptop. They run fine for hours or minutes, and then unexpectedly stop working.. they drives becomes inaccessible until you turn the unit off and then on again.The two at home have started to corrupt data because of this problem."
3,LED light,This light unfortunately was more yellow that white and not as bright as other LEDs we have used. The lamp itself was constructed very well although the switch is unhandy since it is behind the lamp shade. A bat-wing switch would be much preferred for this unit or switch relocated. Would not buy this unit again.
3,Deceptive information,"As I write this in Mid-January of 04, there is little info available at Amazon's page for this item.It is important that potential buyers know that this item is labled as a 'usb' kvm switch. What Iogear means by this is that you plug a monitor cable and a usb cable into each computer, then plug your monitor and PS2 mouse and keyboard into the kvm.I bought this item supposing that I would be able to plug in my USB mouse and keyboard.Otherwise this might be and excellent KVM switch. Unfortunately I had to put a rating on this review so I placed a 3 with my kvm UNOPENED as it does not suit my needs.I hope this helps."
2,Two-handed Scissors,"How nice it would have been if Oxo had designed the locking mechanism so that you could open it the way you do garden shears, with the flick of a finger from the hand that's holding the shears.Instead, every time I reach for my Oxo scissors, I have to use two hands: one to hold them, and one to open the lock. Seems like a small thing, but when your hands are busy and mucky from working in the kitchen, not being able to just reach over, pull out the scissors & use them drives me crazy. Poor design. And then, as others have noted, the red lock often slips around & relocks the scissors. Disappointment from a company that's put out so many well-designed, sturdy, affordable kitchen tools."
4,Great while it lasted,"it worked great while it lived, stayed sharp all these time. But fell apart at the pivot point after 1.5 years."
4,Not too bad,"I have owned these scissors for several months now and was disturbed by reading some of these reviews... Perhaps I got lucky but I have had no problems with my scissors, the spring is a great extra to have, i find the grip to be comfortable, and have had no problems with them cutting. I guess this item may just have to be hit or miss..."
4,Pop in the CD and decorate the tree.,"I wish I could describe what I like about Pizarelli's voice, but can't find the words. He doesn't have a powerful voice, or a rich voice, or in any other way a very distinctive voice; but it's very pleasant to listen to, and he does some good things with the Christmas tunes on this CD.(And don't forget his instrumental guitar work; I've always loved the Leroy Anderson tune ""Sleigh Ride"" and have numerous recordings. The arrangement on this CD really swings)."
4,Christmas Spirit with Pizzarelli personality,"This disc, too long out of print, is spectacular. Pizzarelli's personality comes through and the music is festive, fun, and SO WELL DONE."
2,Lasted a couple of years,"I purchased the Oxo Good Grips Multi Grater back when I was first outfitting my kitchen. At the time, I really disliked box graters because they're hard to clean and once you use it, you couldn't use any of the other sides later without cleaning the entire thing.So, I bought this multi grater because it's easier to clean than a box grater and you can take apart each side and use them individually. The grater is quite sharp and worked well with hard cheeses as well as soft. After a couple of years of use, the side with larger grating holes broke. The plastic surrounding the metal grate snapped. Now the other side is starting to go. All in all, it was a decent purchase but didn't stand the test of time like I would have liked. I'm starting to rethink the box grater idea."
2,Broke after 6 months,"I bought this from a retail store, but I wish I had found these reviews first. After about 6 months the plastic cracked and soon I will need to buy a new grater."
1,Neat design--bad materials,"Although I like the design--especially the non-skid feet--I'm ultimately very disappointed in this grater. Like other reviewers, I've found that after less than six weeks of use, the plastic has started cracking.Contrary to what other reviewers have said, however, you CAN separate the two halves of the grater for cleaning or storage, but I was disappointed by how you can barely spread the grater's feet out more than a few inches...I wish it had a full range of movement. As it is, you can only position the feet about 4 inches apart. I was hoping for a wider foot print for things like quesadillas.Overall, a disappointing product. Neat design, bad materials."
1,"Mine Broke, Too!","I had my grater for about a year, and washed it by hand the whole time, never in a dishwasher, and the cheap plastic cracked and soon completely fell apart. I thought that the collapsable design would be great, but I think that I would prefer a sturdy box grater any day. I love oxo, but what a waste of money."
2,great grater .... but not for long,"I originally got this grater about two years ago and gave it a very good rating based on the ease of use and cleaning; however, I am amending my opinion after having small cracks appear in the plastic beside both grating surfaces. These cracks quickly grew bigger until finally the item is unusable.I guess for the low price you can buy a new one every couple of years but really, a kitchen tool should last longer than a year or two. I'd rather pay more and have it last. It seems that many people have been having this same problem.Good design. Flawed execution. This will make me think twice before buying an OXO product again!"
5,Awesome contemporary Documentary,"This is a great documentary for any involved Christian or a skeptic trying to look from the outside in. What riot studios has produced is a deep message it goes farther from being a documentary, worth watching."
2,Huh?,"After watching this movie, the biggest question in my mind is: Huh? What was the point of the film? I bought this expecting a film on the reality of following Jesus. There was only a cursory treatment of some of the issues that the church faces (i.e. church-goers vs. Jesus-followers). If I was a skeptic I could appreciate their honesty but there's nothing in it that would make me say ""OK I want to follow Jesus."" I also found their discussion about the opposite sex distracting from the message of the film. There were two positives however. The second-to-last chapter (Lucerne Switzerland) contains the most profound statement in the film. And it was pretty funny."
2,"Meh, it's a filmed sermon that I don't mind watching","I will preface this with the fact that I am an atheist.The introduction to this film is misleading because the guys say they're questioning their faith when they are really focused on defining Christianity for themselves. Their exploration is flawed since they interview primarily American tourists and other English speakers. I disagree with some of their beliefs (i.e: Pre-Marital Sex/ Marriage is Between a Man and a Woman), especially the discussion of trying to sway non-believers to convert by doing good.The overall message is still good that they're focused on becoming better people and focusing on the core of Christian values. So meh, because I don't agree with a lot of their spiritual beliefs, but I'll give it 2 stars for working on being better, nonjudgemental people."
1,Not impressed,Very slow... hard to get into... never got past the first 30-minutes. Maybe better suited for college/high school students. not recommended.
5,Great Watch,Item came as described and looked better in person. Great watch for casual wear and outdoors. Been in the ocean a few times as well as in pools and no issues. Highly recommend.
3,Jon and Vangelis,"Excellent quality CD here; however, most of the songs are obscure to US residents I believe. Interesting selections, but calling it the 'best of' isn't the most appropriate title. I imagine the artist(s) chose their personal likes for this compilation, which is fine, just not the most well-known.Great artistry, beautiful haunting melodies and lyrics with delivery only Jon Anderson can achieve. Thanks Jon and Vangelis, always!Michael D.Kansas City, Missouri"
2,YUCK! But there is one great song,"Take the rock group Yes... remove the awesome guitars, virtuous bass, bombastic drums, innovative keyboards, strong songwriting skills and group dynamic and what you have left is this.Jon Anderson has a weird, high pitched voice that is fine when laid against the backdrop of Yes but on its own, it is a bit grating. The eccentric lyrics, that you do not pay much attention to because of the incredible virtuosity of the musicians, also sounds silly. THis is boring elevator music with lyrics.However, ""I'll find my way home"" is a stunning and majestic masterpiece of sheer beauty. If a used cd is less than $8, the one song is worth the purchase."
4,An Album That Merits Critical Acclaim,"It is clear that many musical artists keep a certain vision or style when composing their music. When two artists such and Jon and Vangelis combine their efforts, the best of both of their styles are sometimes brought out together to create brilliant and unique work. Such musical talent is experienced throught this whole album.I find the track ""He Is Sailing"" as a good example of successful collaboration. It is almost essential to point out that Jon's voice virtually sounds magical as it is guided through Vangelis's musical fantasy. The musical assembledge is pleasing to the soul and deserves mass recognition.""A must have for Yes and Vangelis fans."""
4,Inside Skynyrd,"I watched ""Almost Famous: the bootleg cut"" and director Cameron Crowe mentioned interviewing Ronnie Van Zant right before the crash. Ronnie confided to Crowe he was fed-up with a certain member of the band and wanted to fire him, but couldn't bring himself to do it because of loyalty. That got me really interested in reading something about Lynryrd Skynyrd! I've always enjoyed a good Skynyrd tune, but knew next to nothing about the the band members. This is a great book with lots of first hand accounts and interviews. I have nothing to compare it to, as this is the first book I've read on Skynyrd. I do know it kept me interested from beginning to end, and I'm not even what you'd call a ""hardcore"" fan. It's just a well-written and interesting book, very insiteful look at this band."
2,NOT A GREAT SET,"I just did not like how they made this cd sound fake and the songs were not that good.I have a set of the yellow brick road that is just red book and it sounds great bought it at w-----t for 5.00. I used my Classe pre ,amp, oppo 83 es player.My other set up is a INTERGA 9.8 PRE AMP,SONY 9000ES AMP, SONY ES CD PLAYER. THANK YOU"
1,Discs dont work as they should,"I bought two copies of this SACD, both had glitches and would not play in my player correctly, be forewarned. I dont have any other problems with other SACDs so I assume it is in the production somewhere. They would lock up for no reason, this is right out of the box, both copies."
1,Gotta buy whole album for one song!,I love Elton John and wanted to buy some songs off Goodbye Yellow Brick Road but Funeral for a Friend can only be purchased by getting the whole album. Sucks!
4,3rd barons trilogy of adventure!,"This 3rd installment was a fun ride and read. The pace is fast and furious. If you like your action/adventure like this, then this ones for you. Not the best deathlands ever written but definately not the worst either. It was interesting with mutants running amok and bullets flying everywhere! Deathlands fans will have fun with this one."
4,Not a knockout,"Not the revelation that Internal Wrangler was , but still better than 99 percent of the new music out there."
2,ho hum must bring em in,"I don't understand how this is Clinic's big break through album. Internal Wrangler was such an excellent realease - it had passion, a fresh sound and variety between tracks while still being cohesive.Walking With Thee is OK, but lacks all of these elements. I was so excited to come across Clinic, hoping they could break new ground in music (cuz there aren't too many who have done that since Mercury Rev's ""Yerself Is Steam""). However, with this record it appears Clinic is just a one trick pony.With their new found acceptance by the general public, I don't think Clinic will ever feel the need to stray from their singular sound. Tis Sad indeed."
3,A step down for Clinic,"In ""Internal Wrangler"", the listener got assaulted by an eclectic source of sounds and samples. A really exciting journey through psychedelic rock, punk, and more experimental uses of electronic sounds. But in ""Walking With Thee"", the band standardizes itself. Most of the tunes maintain a pretty traditional dance-hall rhythm, the wide array of sounds from ""Internal Wrangler"" are reduced to a handful, and the songs maintain a similar tone throughout, moving between slightly dark and slightly upbeat, but mostly mediocre. If you're interested in Clinic, skip this album. Although it's not a bad one, it's definitely not a great one. Just go straight to ""Internal Wrangler""."
2,"Dopey and charmless, but toddlers like it","Why are Spot videos so popular? It can't be for the chintzy animation, with mouths that don't move and cheesy computer paste-ons. It's not the story; there isn't one. Each segment is just a series of non sequiturs that occur in the same venue. Spot isn't educational; the videos don't teach anything concrete like numbers or shapes, and any socialization the videos show is bad (e.g. making fun of how fat Helen Hippo is). It can't be the voices (the same man and woman are obviously doing all the voices except Spot, with ridiculous accents and changes of pitch) or the dopey, repetitive music with inane lyrics. And it's not because Spot is so appealing; while he doesn't rival Barney for most annoying kids' character, Spot is boring and charmless. When there are fresh, original and delightful videos like the Maisy series, Blues Clues or even the old standby, Sesame Street, why bother with this drivel? Oh yeah, because my toddler likes it."
4,Good Ending To The Series,"In this the final book of the series, Thomas of Hookton is still in France, searching for the Holy Grail. He is also seeking out his sworn enemy Guy Vexille, who he believes may lead him to the Grail.I found this book just as enjoyable as the previous two in the series, perhaps, even more so. I was worried that this book might be too similar to Vagabond, as Thomas was still in France searching for the Grail. However, the introduction of new characters, such as Genevieve, Abbot Planchard, and the Count of Berat, meant that this was not the case.As for the battle scenes in the novel, they were excellent, as usual. The descriptions of the weapons, tactics and armoury of the day were well explained, also."
3,Not his best.,"I am a big fan of Bernard Cornwell's novels, however, the last of the Archer trilogy was a bit of a disappointment. The story seemed hurried and the characters are either undeveloped or out of character from the earlier two books (what's up with Robbie?) It is as if Mr. Cornwell rushed to finish the book too quickly. The entire series lacks the grit and intensity of the Sharpe novels and fails to match the sophisticated story telling of the Arthur (Winter King) trilogy. There is such a thing as being overly prolific. Hopefully, Mr. Cornwell will slow down next time out."
2,Nothing but filler,"I suspect that Coulter's next book will be simply spectacular. Indeed, when it comes out, I may even find myself glad to have read this book, as it seems mainly to consist in providing backstory for what comes next. In the meantime however, I am sadly disappointed. Coulter had the makings of a real winner here, but between bringing us up to date on the last generation of Sherbrookes and setting up one of the youngsters for a story of his own, the love story of James and Corrie as well as the developing relationship between Jason and Judith, is left with very little substance. I have to give Coulter credit, for the denoument of the mystery subplot takes one by complete surprise, and the interplay between Corrie and James, what there is of it, is charming and amusing. These together almost make the book worth a read. Almost that is. . . but not quite."
3,The Sherbroooke Bride its not,"""The Sherbrooke Twins"" is the lastest in the ""Bride Series."" Jason and James Sherbrooke are young men of London and joining them this season is Corrie Tybourne-Barrett a neighbor of the twins. But the Sherbooke family have problems, serveral attempts have been made on Douglas Sherbrooke's life and it looks like man from the family's past is behind it.I loved earlier books in the ""Bride Series"" but the ""The Sherbrooke Twins"" did very little for me. Too me, it seem to me that Ms. Coulter had little interest in turning out a decent book. I loved earlier regency books by the author, but ""The Sherbooke Twins"" did very little for me."
3,3 Stars ONLY because I couldn't stop thinking about...,"I have always enjoyed the Sherbrooke stories, but I couldn't stop thinking about the fact that in Sinjin's story Alex was definitely pregnant - and the twins James and Jason had already been born. What happened to more siblings? Did she have another miscarriage? I kept reading, waiting for a mention of this...Or am I remembering it wrong????"
1,Wrong Movie,"I have been on a French movie kick lately and find many of the Alain Delon movies to be especially entertaining. So I was quite psyched to put this rare movie in the DVD tray the other night for an evening's entertainment. From the opening credits I knew something was off - instead of an ultra-cool French movie from the 60s, I was presented with a very strident 1930s British movie about fishing trawlers (see The Last Adventurers (1937)).What a disappointment! At first I was incredulous and expected to see a grainy Alain Delon make an appearance, but alas he would have been a 2-year old toddler. What makes matters worse is that this movie was obviously captured from a tape source and is a poor presentation of the boring 1937 film. After about 5 minutes I accepted I had wasted my time and money (hello Amazon) and that Alain would be sitting this one out. Either this is gross incompetence or outright bait-and-switch, but do not be deceived by the cover art on this Synergy DVD."
3,A different take....,"After reading through all the hip hop comparisons in the previous reviews, I was surprised that no-one had mentioned how much this sounds like PAVEMENTS first 7"" offerings (or the compilation ""Westing, by Musket and Sextant"") If you like that era PAVEMENT, I think you will like this...this is not an essential album, but will probably be some kids favorite somewhere, and that's always a nice thing...."
4,Innovation and wisdom,"John ties the wisdom he's found from being on the boards of several highly successful start ups with the entrepreneurial/economic theory found in some of the best books on the subject in a way that is both very readable and concise. I loved the quotes, and the stories from his own past. A must read for anyone thinking of starting out on their own. Also extremely well referenced, and will lead you to several other great books on the topic. I read it in a Saturday afternoon."
4,awesome,"Slow, terrific, controlled jams, with lots of tension and space between the notes. This is the best live Humble Pie I've ever heard; it beats the bombastic, post-Frampton hard-rock Pie, which I've always had a soft spot for. Later, the band would be plenty fun, loud, over-the-top, faux-soulful, etc. -- but here they're low-key, seriously groovy, unpretentious -- for my money, at the height of their powers.The take of ""Shakey Jake"" is a little limp and leaden (my favorite version is the one on ""BBC Sessions""), but the four other looooong jams are fantastic, particularly the 21-minute ""I Walk on Gilded Splinters."" I'm not a big fan of ""jammy"" music to begin with -- that's why I was first attracted to the tight, arena-rock Pie -- but this music doesn't try to be ""authentically"" and studiously bluesy, jazzy, etc. (like so many more famous and respected artists of the day) -- yawn! Instead, it's just truly great rock and roll, intense and relaxed at the same time."
3,Good for the money,"Not as soft as you might expect, nor as silky as nice sateen sheets. Wrinkles a lot when you wash it.The good news is that it seems very sturdy and built pretty well, and it was an absolute steal. Faaaaaar below any comparable product (on price).Made in Pakistan. Care tag on it says that it was made exclusively for Linens N Things -- seems like an overstock item, I guess.Pleased with the purchase."
1,Not impressed,There isn't much else to say. The killer looks goofy and the supporting cast are cardboard at best.
2,Didn't last long,I received one of these cheese graters for Christmas this year. By May it was broken. The plastic at the bottom of the barrel cracked and a piece broke off. I also missed having the two different sized barrels that I had in my old cheese grater. It's back to Pampered Chef for me!
3,"Clever design, but fragile","We found this grater to be convenient and easy to use. However, it did finally develop a cracked plastic body which made it unuseable. Ours lasted about a year. It is still preferable to the old style board graters and the rather crude metal rotary graters. If only it was sturdier! I'm on a search for something better"
5,a+,"This touring directory is one of the best on the market, well above the not so few others that I’ve browsed through. I found out that this guide had all that I needed: great contact info, accurate details, no errors, and a whole lot of explanations and directions"
5,most useful,"As as ongoing person i like parties very much and i'm a regular clubber but it seems that nowadays finding the best club is becoming an increasingly difficult task. I really neded a guide, some sort of book that would help me sort out the good from the bad. I tried a couple of paperback guides but this CDROM cought my attention because many people recommended it to me before and it seemed to be the toght decission for me."
2,The nut strips easily,We bought two of these and they both broke in the same way: the tensioning nut stripped after about 1 year of use.
1,Handle is plastic--will break,"I loved this cheese slicer until if fell on the floor ONCE. The handle (looks like it has metal inside but its all plastic) snapped right off. OXO is getting real good at making junk look good, but don't be fooled--its still just junk."
3,really Fab until it breaks...,"I love Oxo and this product is no different. I loved how it performed on every cheese from fontina to jarlsberg; however, after 4 months the wire popped out of one side. I'm thinking this might be a known flaw since Oxo also makes a version that has a replaceable wire."
1,Broke after about ten uses,"The first couple of times I used this cheese slicer, the wire stretched out, making the slices thicker than they're supposed to be. Today I finally cut through a hard hunk of sharp cheddar and POP - the wire broke. For $20, I expect more. Next time I'll buy a non-wire cheese slicer. VERY disappointed as I expect more of OXO."
1,"Go witht the traditional ""cheese plane"" type","Like in the other reviews, the wire broke after only a few uses. I just emailed OXO and asked for a replacement. I hope they honor the satisfaction garantee!"
1,"works initially, then fails","When new, this product worked well and felt solid. After a few weeks the wire loosened, and cannot be tightened. This is the first Oxo product I have been disappointed with. Very poor quality."
2,Disappointing Durability,"They just don't make cheese slicers like they used to these days. I thought I'd finally found a durable slicer, one that would last longer then an entire block of cheddar cheese.Well, yes, this one did last for about 4 blocks of cheese. It had good promise but just didn't live up to expectations.Anyone have recomendations for proven alternatives?"
5,Wowzers!!,"Not that the songs on this album are new, but they have done it yet again. This is mabye my second favorite album they have put out. It is a collection of songs up till the 1996 release date of the album. There are a lot of songs you P5 fans will recognize from previous and US released albums. However, they will be different versions. If you are a P5 fan who is familiar with the US releases, you will get to hear a couple of singers who sang in the band before Maki. There are also a couple of Tokyo radio commercials. And my favorie is a live acustic version of ""The Night is Still Young"" off of the US release THE SOUND OF MUSIC. The song is a live radio performance, and really shows how music P5 can be, not to mention versed in different styles! The version I got also has a couple of flip through picture books. The whole thing came in a small white box. If you have the money, then it is a must have. Very beautiful album."
4,Great for kids!,"The one and only reason I grabbed this was because I have kids that love bagels. I would cringe watching them try to cut one themselves and had a hard time resisting the urge to grab knife and bagel away from the preteenagers and do it for them. Bought this thing, and it solved the problem. I picked it up at TJ MAXX for only 5.00, and it came with a spreader and offset bread knife - what a find! I've since bought one for a friend with arthritic hands, and she loves it. Admittedly, its probably something you can do without unless you eat a lot of bagels or have difficulty with your hands, but its a good product and a nice tool to have around."
2,Not Worth The Money!,"This video was poorly done. You can tell it was amature made. The five woman that grace the cover are the main woman throughout the movie. They throw in a couple of other girls, but their butts aren't as big as the first five you see. The background music is Ok; it grows on you throughout the movie.The only reason why I rate this a 2 is because of the butts, other than that it would have received a 1."
5,great book,This is one of my classes favorite books. It also comes with a CD that makes this book even more fun to read.
3,"Crap On My Tongue, Scrape It Off","There is crap on my tongue that can be removed with this thing. I just don't use it much, but it does work. I need to stop getting crap on my tongue so I don't have to scrape it off."
5,Husband's favorite jeans,"These jeans are tough but good looking and fit well. Amazon's price is great, they are a good value for the money, and we always get prompt delivery and easy return if size is not right."
5,The just right jeans for my boots,"These boot cut jeans by my favorite jeans maker are exactly what I needed.When I ordered my Harley Davidson boots,I needed pants for when I wear them and these ones are the only ones that fit on the outside where others can't.Shopping local yields nothing like these,just junk not worth the money.Quality is what I've come to expect from Levi's,outstanding with fit absolutely perfect.More orders coming soon for these.Shipping was prompt,making this buyer very happy.Thank you to everyone for helping this lonely guy that hardly can get out to shop by bringing them to me.Again,THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!"
1,This is terrible! I am upset and disappointed!,"This is terrible! I am upset and disappointed!I ordered a pair of 517 jeans using a size . The jeans mailed to me showed the size on the Levi's patch, however they were several inches too long and the waist was much wider than normal. This was definitely not the size stated on the label.Very frustrating, especially after we were eagerly anticipating their arrival I hesitate to mail-order jeans again after this experience."
5,Levis,"Finally found levis that were the correct size, if they are still available I will order more in the future"
3,Too tight,I ordered this and had to wait several weeks to get it. But was disappointed when I tried it on. It was too tight. I have a jeans from Gap measuring 29x32. It fits me great. Not sure why the same measurement from from Levi's doesn't fit.
4,Rigid is not a color!,Good quality but I wish I had done more research on the colors. Ordered rigid because of the look online however the denim itself is rigid.
5,Great pair of jeans!,Levi's 517 Boot Cut JeansWhat a nice pair of rugged jeans. And I got them so FAST!! Thanks again.Roxann Hill
5,What can I say?,"What can I say? They are Levis. Perfect fit, excellent quality, and the most impressive thing was the price. Unbelievable!"
2,Levi's changes sizes again,"I have worn the 517 for over twenty five years and Levi's exclusively over 50 years. Two years ago, the cut changed and all 517's were relaxed fit. Send back and change size because they were too big. SO I ordered the same thing but now 517's are ""slim cut"". Doesn't work on me, I need some extra room. Now the number is 557 for the relaxed fit and I get to pay the postage to return the wrong cut jeans. Shame on Levi's: they should not have changed these 2 years ago and then change again this year."
3,Not the same Levi's,"The fabric is not the same as it use to be, it is much thinner. If you have a blem or a loose weave (small fabric loop) esprecially in the front thigh area, it will be the place that the fabric fails. You can feel these if you rub your hands along your lap. If you have light dye spots sometimes almost white, these too can be a quick source of fabric failure. These jeans will deteriate very quickly once the fabric weave fails. Amazon was great concerning returning one pair out of four ordered, but the replacement has it's issues and will show problems before the exchange window expires. They are made in Mexico and lack the old ""MADE IN USA"" quality. I would rather see Levi's keep the old standard and charge me more because they would be worth it. They should offer a ""Heritage"" fabric option. Other than the fabric, they are the same. I still love my Levi's and have been wearing them for over 35 years!"
4,A little to big,"Will have to wash several times for them to fit. I buy this size all the time from other retailers and they aren't this big. Like the color and the style. They just run big I guess. Mainly in the length. Would buy again, just a smaller size."
2,Not the same,"Ive been wearing Levi's over 40 years. These are not the same old Levi's! The fit is baggy, the sizing is not consistant, I bought 2 pair and they fit and wear are totally different. Probably won't buy any levi products again"
3,I need it,"Well, maybe I needed more information to choose the exact jeans, because the boot it's not exactly that my boyfriend wanted. Eventhough, it was my mistake."
4,I like this style,"I like this style and they are getting very hard to find. The price here was the best I found, got in a timely manner. I'm happy with my purchase."
3,Levi 517 Boot cut Jeans,The jeans are fine except for fit. I ordered normal fit 36 in waist and 29 in length. I am satisfied with the waist and length but find the Jeans to be incredibly baggy. Far too loose at the hip and thigh.
5,Great Fit,I finally found a pear of jeans that my wife said they look good on me and after being washed still fits great
2,An Uninspiring Read,"Darden Asbury Pyron has a rather dry style which made this a rather boring and long-winded read for me. He has done little but assemble historical facts and comments and package them up in his own uninspiring style - rather reminiscent of school history textbooks - and added a few of his own little presumptions and snide remarks about Liberace's ambitions, achievements and lifestyle."
4,very good winged corkscrew,This is a very good winged corkscrew quite easy to use. This is probably just as sturdy as anything else that is out there these days. The plastic does seem a bit flimsy to an old person like me because I remember when all plastics were flimsy. I am Arthritic but had no trouble a tall using it.
3,Half the time Cork gets Split,"I don't know why or what I may be doing wrong, but this seems to split the cork when I use it. It doesn't always, but I'd say half the time I use it the screw goes in straight but goes sideways and breaks the cork when it brings it up. Then I have to use it again to get the rest of the cork.However it does take the cork out without having to muscle it out. The cork is not always in one piece, but it's out."
3,Its ok,"Its ok. Usually I rave about OXO products but this one was just..well... ""ok"" to me. Will I use it? Yes. Would I buy it again? Not sure."
3,Tamagotchi - Good and Bad Points,"The Tamagotchi is great when you first get it.However, your first one might not survive for too long because you haven't got used to how you work it.So you get another one, (by pressing A and C)You give it a name and have loads of fun. Right?NOIt can get really annoying (especially at night) because you might have forgot to have paused it or turned the sound off and it will beep at you and wake you up. Or you could be really engrossed in a conversation/book/film and it will beep at you for attention. It becomes to be like an annoying brother or sister.Turning the sound off is a relief but then how do you know if it is sick? Then it will die and you will have to start all over again.So, having a Tamagotchi is a great idea. But I would recommend keeping it as an idea.After all, there is no off button."
1,Musical Garbage,"Jars of Clay has had some catchy tunes and meaningful words in the past, but the lyrics have degenerated into confused, pseudo-profound ramblings. Furthermore, the music lacks taste and variety. With only vague reference to God, in what sense can this CD be called Christian?"
5,"""The Eleventh Hour"" is the finest hour","What can I say? I just listened to TEH and feel I've heard""The White Album"" of Christian music...A masterpiece!!"
4,A Good Effort,"Like all their previous records, JOC has crafted an unusual and different picece with ""The 11th Hour."" However, even though a few songs (notably ""Silence"" and ""Revolution"") have a certain attractive ring, this album is generally a little less brilliant than their previous ones. It has such a very dry (no reverb), raw-but-clean sound to it that (to me anyway)it just doesn't quite work the whole time. Also I think that songs like ""Fly"" are arranged a little too ""bouncily"" and lose what could have been a heart-wrenching mood (though the line ""now you're alive"" is one of the most poignant expressions of Heaven that I have ever heard). Despite the imperfections, though, ""The 11th Hour"" is a strong cut above most music you'll hear released in this age of pseudo-grunge; I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates something not run-of-the-mill."
4,always good,"Basically, this is an excellent album. Production wise, it's very different from their previous work, and parts of it sound very raw (Dan Haseltine's vocals on 'Silence' for eg) I don't think us fans need to worry too much though, because there's plenty of memorable moments to be had on this disc. 'I Need You' is about the only track that sounds anything like the bands first album, with the dance orientrated loop layered underneath, but apart from that I feel that 'The Eleventh Hour' is simply a progression of 'If I Left The Zoo' which was also an extraordinary album. The only track I can't stand is 'Revolution' - it's just not them. Jars of Clay are at their best when they concentrate on Dan Haseltine's vocals and Matt Odmark's guitars. The three singles already lifted from the album are good indications of what you can expect - 'I Need You', 'Fly', and the title track 'The Eleventh Hour'."
3,What happened?,"Definantly not their best album. It suffers in creativity, and uniquness, (basically all around sound writing). However, a couple songs make the album worth listening to. I prefer their self titled album instead."
1,Too horrible for words,"This cd is way too horrible for words. Their first album is really the only one you should buy of theirs, because their subsequent ones have just paled in comparison. This one in particular is the worst one they've ever done. I feel sorry for those people who say this one is their best. They obviously are not right in the head and need to learn to think more clearly. This album is pure garbage and anyone should be smart enough to realize that. In fact I believe that this one album being as popular as it is signifies America's downfall and God help us all if this album continues to be a hit. Please I beg anyone reading this review to not help America continue it's downward spiral into the toilet. This album should be outlawed as soon as possible. Thank you for your time."
2,Maybe Later,"Imagine Psalms minus the drama and soul-searching quandries. But in rhyming verse. I'm not saying the book is bad. It may be that my soul just isn't old enough to see the value here. Each entry is very short. If you're the sort of person who can comtemplate a single line of poetry, you may get a lot out of this. If you're not, you can flip through this book in a single afternoon (but you probably won't). Maybe I'll appreciate this work later in life. Maybe not.I really like his book of ""Unspoken Sermons"", though."
4,"A little expensive, but works great.",These mounts work great for the 8 lb NHT Absolute Zero speakers hanging from them. Once attached to the wall (into a stud) they feel very solid. The only minor issue is getting the wrench between the speaker and wall when trying to tighten the screw. Fortunately this only needs to be done once (or twice if adjustments are needed) when installing.
1,I don't believe 20 lbs rating.,"Idea of using an Allen wrench to tighten in tight area between the speaker and the wall is a very bad idea. Especially not easy to do when you're on a ladder, supporting your speaker with one hand. Would be much easier if I could use ratcheting socket wrench. Can't get it to support 15 lbs. speakers. The speakers end up resting against the wall. Maybe you'll have better luck.Directions that came with them seem to be bad photo-copies. Get on-line directions - not the highest resolution but better than the ones that come with the package."
2,"Nice construction, but don't work","The mounts are very nice construction and the kits are good, but frankly they don't work that well. I have 14# speakers on each mount and no matter how hard I have tried to tighten the bolts, the speakers sag until they touch the wall for a wall mount. I have had someone else hold it up while tightening with both hands and a wrench until I can turn the bolt no farther. 30 minutes later it has slowly slid to the wall. For a lighter speaker it may work, but the mounts shouldn't be rated to 20#."
3,Warning - Not a Pair - Only One !,"I would normally start this review by saying ""These speaker mounts are ..."" but unfortunately, I have to write ""This speaker mount is ..."" because for the advertised price, you only get one mount. I just assumed that because most speakers come in pairs then so would mounts. Every other speaker mount I've bought has come as a pair but that's not the case here and is why I'm only giving this item three stars. That makes buying a pair of these quite pricey but this speaker mount is good quality and holds quite a heavy speaker. I'd probably give it four of five stars if I'd received two for $27 but as it is, I only got one and felt a little bit ripped off to be honest."
4,Don't buy it here,"Review follows: I bought it here for $[...], but found out thatyesasia.com has it much cheaper ([...]).This set has a few gems on it, including slower songs. However I was lookingfor her more ""pop oriented"" work, and there were few tracks of this type.Overall a pleasant set, but mostly ""just okay"" selections."
4,Common,"Resurrection is an awesome album. Produced in 1994 it broke the mold of the gangsta rap that was so prevalent. A very musical album with songs your sure to play over and over again; Common's ""Resurrection"" is a must have."
1,Don't do it.,This item came to us chipped. They had tried to repair it...botched the repair and then shipped it out as though it was new at full price. Had already removed old sink...had to go out and pay more locally and then go through the hassle of returning it. If I could give this company negative 5 star rating I would.
3,Room for improvement,"I met this album by chance, i got and ipod with this, and lot of common's albums...i actually like I Used To Love H.E.R. so i decided to give it a try, so i started with this album, and this is my personal review...The only song that i consider a 5star song is ""A penny for my thoughts"", the beat is incredible and his flow in this song is insane. Although i really like ""Breaker 1/9"" and ""Puppy Chow"", im not going to gave them 5stars for one reason: If someone will ask me to choose between Breaker 1/9 Vs Big Poppa By B.I.G. and Puppy Chow Vs Bury Me a G By Thug Life (Eventhoug i now those are different songs with diferent concepts and lyrics), my decision is easy....Finally i found some good/decent songs like Charms Alarm, Take It Easy, Heidi Hoe, Soul By The Pound and some, with solid lyrics in the most cases, but definetely forgetable songs.I take a glance of his Resurrection Album, and that seems to be the album i was expecting."
2,Piece of Junk,"Installed this on a new build and immediately the fan started spinning loudly and to think this unit is supposed to keep things quietly. The following day, the system would not boot up at all due to a Thermal Control Module (TCM) that went bad overnight. I tried calling CoolIt Systems technical support line and someone is supposedly calling me back. Well, I been waiting for over a week now and still no return call. Will try again."
2,"Ensure That This Is Your ""Type"" Of String Band.","It should be pointed out that FSMB are ""truly traditional"" and that their repertoire might not suit lovers of the more refined string band music. The brilliant Hollow Rock String Band epitomise the gentrified kind and you should surely listen to ""The Fuzzies"" before making your purchase."
3,Rhapsody,This was a book chosen for book club for a study of books that have been turned into films.
5,Heated small combo swing session,"Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn split the piano duties on this set, so don't get disapointed to find out Ellington ISN'T on ever ycut. However Johnny Hodges warm sax is featured thruout. This is a prime example of 1950's small combo swing at it's hottest and coolest!"
5,Bury Me With This CD,"This is hands down one of the best, smoothest, swingingest cds you'll ever buy. EVER! I bought this for my bro who intro'd me to jazz and I was floored when he said he didn't have this one. Dude, this is ESSENTIAL. A must have. Again, this is another cd you can play at anytime: driving kids to little league, baking a pie, jumping out airplanes, negotiating world peace, in time out, studying, eating flapjacks - kid, you can't go wrong here - put your money down and enjoy the life you are about to have with this music in it, 'cause baby the old one without this, just wasn't worth it."
5,A Great Story,"This is a good western with a lot of heart. Conagher is a man of few words, yet by his life and by the few words he speaks, he is able to change the lives of the people around him. Young men know that meeting Conagher is a turning point in their lives; they can either learn from Conagher and become better men, or reject him and slide into a life of thievery and disgrace. Conagher is just a leader of men no matter where he meets them.The love story is a good one too, very subdued and quiet, like the man Conagher himself. He is just a cowboy of the trail, with little money and less future. Will there ever be any woman who sees his true worth?"
3,"Good ""Office"" style comedy","Season 2 builds on season 1 and becomes drier and funnier as it progresses. The timing of the actors has improved greatly over Season 1.I see a lot of guest appearances in this Season which keeps the momentum going.I only gave it 3 stars because it is not in HD on amazon prime and it feels like certain story themes have been copied from other sitcoms.Still highly recommended if you enjoy the ""Office"" style of comedy where the characters are aware that they are on camera and being filmed."
4,Increases test scores,"I had my 11th grade students do two exercises at a time, twice a week as our daily starter activity, about 5 minutes/day. At the end of the semester, students scored 5-10 points higher on a practice language arts SAT packet (about 30 questions) than did the students the previous semester who had not done the Daily Spark activities. Usually I did not even need to discuss why the answers were correct. I'm impressed.The questions were about all that stuff that we teach, that the students think they will never need: vocabulary, commas and semicolons, passive voice, inferencing, etc.Students do need to be warned that the real college entrance exams have longer reading sections than the short paragraphs in these activities."
3,towel holders,i bought these clips to hold kitchen towels on the fridge. the magnets are not strong enough. would not stay on fridge.
4,multi-engine flying,"Great book for multi-pilots, also includes all necessary info for oral and practical tests."
1,this edition blows,"This cheap Tor edition features a useless introduction by Charles Grant and an even more useless afterword by same. Other than that, it's just the bare text without any footnotes or annotations of any kind."
1,Low rating is for the Afterword,"I admire the actual story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde as well as the personal history and other works of Robert Louis Stevenson.This afterword, however, of Jerome Charyn's is almost more than I can bear.I'll be frank. Is this an afterword with supposed insightful information into the nuances of the story, and or the writer/period/genre, or a freakin book report. Kids, if you're buying this book for class, get this edition and don't even bother reading the actual story if you're not interested. Skip to the very back and you'll find all the multi-paragraph quotes you can handle, as well as rambling general encyclopaedic info on Robert Louis Stevenson.I think I wrote an ""essay"" exactly like this as a freshman in highschool english class and received a C for lack of creativity and effort. That's not exactly a compliment for you Mr. Charyn."
5,Dover edition all you need it to be- - - book fabulous,"""The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" is fantastic book that is subtly chilling and a classic mystery/horror novel. That being said, Dover Thrift Editions is a real bargain at less than a dollar. Unlike other editions that group this novel into a book with the author's other stories, Dover just gives you the novel, unabridged and raw. No introductions, criticsm, footnotes, etc. So if all you want is the novel save a lot of paper and money and buy this wonderful book in Dover Thrift Edition."
4,Great short story,I found this a fascinating story and appreciated the extra information about C.S. Lewis and the insights into the book at the end.
5,great book,excellent book. wish stevenson had explored topic more.literature above the common materilistic crap fiction most people read.steveson is for the ages.
3,jekyll and hyde,"This book was not the best book I have ever read, nor is it the worst. There were many interesting aspects about it, but others were vague. It had a very weak beginning and was hard to get into, but after the first couple of chapters, it really was interesting. I would reccomend it to people who enjoy mysteries and a sort of horror."
3,Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was not what I thought it would be!,"I only read the introduction and the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. I found out that the story was quite exciting. I thought it would be too complicated to read, but I found that it wasn't until I got to the last chapter. The last chapter had a lot of complicated words because it is the narrative of Dr. Jekyll, who, well, is a doctor! The last chapter did explain a lot, though. So I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about scary things, like a doctor who turns into a mad man!"
3,The Oldies Thriller,"Robert Lewis Stevenson's psychological thriller was horrifyng... if you lived in late 1800's during the industrial revolution. To me it was a story 52 pages long that could have been summed up in about 20. However, despite its shortcomings, it did present me with a few mind twisters. These spiced it up a bit when the action was getting dull but over all there weren't enough. Another high point of the book were the different perspectives it gave. It was worthwhile to hear different opinions on what was going on. MARQUETTE HIGH RULES!!!"
1,Too many of these books arrive damaged.,"I ordered extra copies of this book to give as gifts, but they all arrived with some damage, some with a lot of damage. I kept two with the least amount of damage. It feels more like a problem with the publisher rather than Amazon."
3,Bought it for School,"We purchased this book for a school summer reading assignment. It did not meet our expectations as the pages are so thin, they could not be highlighted as required by the teacher. The color ran through to the next page making it impossible to read or highlight that page... We were hoping for more substantial paper throughout the book. If you don't care about the thinness of the paper, then this book will easily meet your needs."
2,Not a classic,"Please, it is exagerated to think this book is a classic, such a opinion is too restrict and reflects a readers too simple meaning of life."
4,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"I thought this was a very challenging book, and it was hard to understand. I couldn't understand alot of the words since it is so old. But once you start understanding it, it really is a great story. Even though I already knew before I started reading it that they were the same person, I didn't know the rest of the story, and it was very interesting how Jekyll had written his will to Mr. Hyde. I like how he had the potion to stop and he was doing a good job, but then he finally gave in. I like this book, but it was challenging."
4,Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.,This book was interesting to read but not for elementary and middle school kids but it's a good book in itself
5,A wonderful book,"This book is a must read for anyone who has had interest in this tale. It has been much ""modernized"" since the book's original publication, and deserves to be read in it's original form,free from it's movie adaptations."
4,Read orginals,While something is lost in knowing the relationship between Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde before you read it. I believe this classic is worth the read. Found the story still interesting and found out I didn't know as much about the story as I thought. It always good to find were these now classic character had there start.
4,Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde: A Book Worth Reading,Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was the book of the century. It was a novel that did a great job dealing with the good versus evil controversy that is within all of us. The character of Mr. Hyde showed that even someone as good as Dr. Jekyll had a side that wasn't perfect. The characters had to struggle through the times of the Victorian period when people were very opinionated and were a lot like the people of society today. Everyone has another side to them and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde can help you find that side. I highly recommend reading this great novel. It can help you deal with the good versus evil that is within you.
5,Another triumph from Jean Redpath,"Has she ever done anything that's NOT wonderful? She sings these songs better than I've ever heard them done by anyone else and makes it seem as easy as breathing. There are some great songs here-- old warhorses like ""The Gypsy Laddie"" and ""She Moved Through the Fair,"" in simple, fresh interpretations, but also some songs that are much less well-known, though equally good. ""The Kirk Swaree"" made me laugh out loud. A great album!"
5,forgotten diva,"The first time I heard this CD, I just sat in amazement that I had never heard this voice! It is a masterpiece of phrasing and purity. It was as if I was hearing ""Lazy afternoon"" for the first time. She swings and slinks through standards and songs I've never heard before with true diva grace. This album is a MUST. Lucy, if you read this...bless you!"
2,Some parts are good,"I like the demos by one of the presenters that showed some of Brian's guitar ""tricks"", but the rest was ho-hum."
5,SUPER,"I got this book on a recommendation for my husband for Christmas. He eats, sleeps, and drinks comics and LOVES the book. So, that's all that matters to me!"
5,my daughter read it till it was ragged,"I was diagnosed when my kids were 10 and 12 and they both read this book till the pages were torn and ragged. 7 years later, I was cleaning out my daughter's room and had that book in the ""give away"" pile. ""Oh no, you're not giving THAT book away"" she said. ""I love that book"""
4,Places the man squarely in his setting,"This is a fascinatingly rich account of Melville's development as a writer with a particularly strong focus on his surroundings and environment and their influence on his work. DelBanco is at his best when describing settings such as 1840's Manhattan with it's noise , crowds and filth. Melville emerges through the details as the narrative shifts seamlessly between historical anecdotes to literary biography and analysis. For anyone with an interest in Melville this is time well spent."
3,Hershel Parker's rehash,"All of the comments about this book are true with the exception that the majority of the biographical findings stem from Hershel Parker's groundbreaking, momentuous two-volume work that maintains itself as THE definitive biography of Melville. Credit Mr. Parker for The Isle of the Cross details, not Delbanco who was one of Parker's most vocal critics and once disputed the biographer's findings on The Isle of the Cross. However, if you do not want to wade through Parker's immense work, then go for this."
5,Spanish I Review,"This has been a very helpful resource for me to refresh my Spanish knowledge from high school. It is full of great examples, which make it much easier to remember things you review. If you have trouble retaining things; this book will be a tremendous help. I recommend this for all ages and for all basic to intermediate students."
5,A neglected gem,"I have not read all of this book and to be frank some of it is beyond my ability, but quite a lot of it is not. In any case this is not the type of book that you pick up and read in one sitting.The book presents a unifying theory that covers a great many phenomena in mathematics and science. The basic concept is deceptively simple: transform a problem, solve the transformed problem and then reverse transform it. One elementary example is to mulitiply two numbers by adding their logarithms. A second is to communicate across a long distance by tranforming voice into electrical current.This simple idea has wide applicability. Most of the book presents examples from a wide range of fields. They will make you look at things in a different light. Bypasses deserves a wider audience."
2,References other commentators too much,"This book has good information however the arthur referrences other commentators too much which is a destraction for the reader from the main points of the book. Also, this book needs to be more simplified...enough that even a 10 year old can understand it as a new Christian."
2,"Not too Sunny,rather cloudy","Not Kern or Hammerstein at their best,title tune repeated too many times , story as told ,is about as dumb as one would expect for a show of the era.To revive the show would be a task of no rewards."
2,Eh,"I don't really care for this book, the puppet is too small for my hands, also the story is kind of short and boring. Elmo is great but the price of this book is not justified. Buy a puppet and a book, don't get this ""puppet-book"""
2,The Product Was Torn To Shreds,"While the book was fun and exciting for my child, the actual book was torn to shreds. The quality did not meet expectations."
5,One of the best Qi gong DVDs out there!,"After doing Qi gong for many years and owning many DVDs and books, Dr. Yang's DVD is really informative and thorough. Many people get caught up in the different styles and names and unfortunately because Chinese culture is organically evolved this way. Dr. Yang has a healthy inclusive attitude about this and many teachers do not. No one style is better than another.It is important to keep it mentally simple but physically consistent. Said another way, it is in the doing not in the finding the secret style to make you indestructible or immortal."
4,Qigong excercise,I bought this for a very busy daughter that has no time. Even though I enjoyed watching the tape and understood why I was doing the procedure much better than on other tapes I felt it went very slowly and my daughter would lose interest in the tape before the excercise actually started. She excercises daily and has an allotment of time before she goes to work. I will keep the tape for me as I am retired and look for a possible faster tape that gets into the excercise for my daughter.I thought it was a very good tape and would recommend to others.
4,Once is not enough,"I have read the book, underlined it, practiced the exercises, reread it and then highlighted new information that I missed the first time, but found it to be important the second time. I continue to use it as reference when in doubt.As with most books it is always good to read them 2 or 3 times and there is always something new to learn."
3,Pug review,"This was a gift to my grandson. Although he had it on his wish list, he didn't seem too thrilled with it."
5,Best Spinner Ever,"Veggie people will love this. It is sturdy, very easy to use, and more effective at drying lettuce, etc. than any spinner I have owned. The bonus is you can use it to store in the frig and it keeps salad beautifully. Highly recommend."
4,Good for washing and spinning leafy produce!,"I use this for both washing/rinsing and spinning my leafy produce. (For washing, I just fill the bowl with water, swish around the greens, then lift the inner basket to drain, and repeat.) It's sturdy and easy to clean. (It takes up a lot of room in the drainer, but I can't really see a way around that for a spinner this size.) I don't use it for storing produce because it takes up too much room in the fridge; I transfer to a bag for storage. I wish it wasn't so expensive, but I've been satisfied with my purchase."
2,"I love Oxo, but . . .",". . . this salad spinner does not work and I'm surprised at so many positive reviews. The old string-pull type I had (and recently threw away, alas) let you run water into an opening while you spun it, then you could turn off the water and spin it dry. All the way dry, unlike this one. Because the string spinner let you get it going fast enough to repel all the water. This one won't get going fast enough to get the greens all the way dry. So you have to rinse the greens separately, then put them in the spinner, and then finish off by drying them with a paper towel. Give me back my old string spinner!"
4,Salad spinner,Works well. The kids love making the salad with this gadget. My only disappointment was it's a bit too big for our family of four.
2,Worked great until it broke,"This was a wonderful salad spinner for the several months it worked. Then it broke. In my kitchen, very few things break. The occasional wooden spatula after fifteen years of use is fine but things tend not to break unless I drop them. This is my second Oxo product that broke while I was using it (the other one was a knife--yes, a knife snapped in two while I was cutting). I still love my Oxo peeler but with two out of three of my Oxo products breaking, I'm done with Oxo for the most part."
3,Worked fine...for a while,"This worked pretty well for me 2-3 times a week for 18 months. Then the plunger used to spin the inner colander started jamming and finally couldn't get unstuck. I still use parts of this as a bowl and colander. Still, I would expect this to last a little longer."
4,Good purchase,"This salad spinner works really well, however, be sure to put on top shelf of dishwasher. Tends to warp from the heat."
2,Liked it at first... but,"This was a gift from my in-laws and I was thrilled to have new salad spinner. I have always had those really old cord ones.Initially it worked really well, but it is hard to clean. You have to disassemble the lid, and it appears the more you do that, the more goes wrong. Eventually the whole thing just stopped working and the lid wouldn't stay together.The older-style pull-cord spinners have fewer parts to break and are easier to clean. Get a Zyliss instead."
1,a waste of money,"My old salad spinner, which I had for about 10 years, was getting shabby. So I replaced it with the small Oxo salad spinner. Big mistake! First it took many many spins to get the water out and even then some water always remained. But the main problem was that within a month, when I took the top apart to clean it,as directed, the spring popped out. I was able to get it to work again, somewhat, for a few more months after that. But yesterday, it just fell apart and like Humpty Dumpty, it couldn't be put back together again. I've liked other products by this company, but the cheap construction and poor quality of this product would make me look more closely into buying other brands instead."
5,The Best Spinner,"My friend had the OXO Good Grip Salad Spinner and liked the idea of having the salad bowl built into the salad spinner. When our old salad spinner broke we brought the Good Grip Spinner. The old spinner had handle and was at best not very user friendly. This spinner is great to use and make salad preping simple and easy.We like the lock mechanism it's a nice feature for storing in the refrigerator or in your cabinets.We love it, easy to use, clean and store, its only spinner you will need."
3,"Good for drying and storing lettuce, but water can't flow through","This is good for drying and storing lettuce. I assumed this would have a hole for water to flow through while you spin the salad, but that is not the case. Still useful and good quality."
1,Buy Zyliss instead,"I have one of these that I would be glad to send someone if they would pay for the shipping. I have purchased several of the Zyliss and would recommend that instead. We use them in my restaurant and unless you drop them, they last a long time."
1,Recommended cleaning resulted in broken product,"I'm very disappointed by how easy it was to break the lid when trying to disassemble it GENTLY to follow the cleaning instructions provided with the product. Its spinning ability seems to deteriorate with weekly use after the first month. Cheap! I will NEVER use this model, or any OXO salad spinner again."
4,Very good,"I like this a lot, and it doubles as a soak-and-drain unit for many foods. It doesn't get greens completely dry, but dry enough, and it sure beats wrapping them in a towel! Like most say, you pretty much can't go wrong with Oxo. Their pepper mill is fabulous!"
2,Good but questionable durability,I bought this a year ago and was excited and happy with it. Now about a year later I'm dissapointed enough to write this review. The first thing to go missing was the little black knob that is the brake. Then one day the top came apart and now parts are missing. Oh well! I guess I got a year out of it - though I don't consider that long enough. I just don't know which one is better and more durable?
4,"Works well, but do you need the full capacity?","OXO has a smaller version to consider before you buy this unit. If your household is small, or the salad you make is less than a full head of lettuce, the smaller version is worth considering.This larger version takes up more storage space, not only in the cupboard but also in the dish drainer. That's a consideration when you realize that you need to wash the bowl and colander between uses, and that the inner mechanism on the underside of the cover also needs a chance to dry! I prefer to clean up in the kitchen as I do meal prep, and to let utensils air dry. The larger version made it enough more difficult because of its space requirements that I broke down and bought the smaller one recently.Bottom line: Look at both--and think--before you buy."
3,Way too big..,"The description doesn't say the capacity of this thing and I couldn't believe how big it was when I received it. I didn't even try it out..returned it and am waiting for the mini version. Unless you need a huge amount of lettuce or anything else..beware of how large it is. It is hard to store, the storage lid that you use instead of the spinning one to store veggies in the refridgerator is NO LONGER SOLD ON eBAY. That was disappointing as well. Seems like a good product otherwise..."
4,Solid,Good construction and works well.With arthritis and limited arm strength it would much easier to use if spin knob required less force to push down.
4,Very good spinner. What's the problem?,"Reading over some recent reviews I can't believe the belly aches. ""Doesn't fit easily in the dishwasher"". Who puts a salad spinner in the dishwasher? Just rinse the lettuce bits off and let it air dry. ""Doesn't spin very fast"". How fast do you need a salad spinner to go? If you can't get the Oxo Good Grips salad spinner to spin fast enough to dry lettuce you are either over-filling it or you can't pump the easy ergonomic handle for some reason. This unit is well designed and comfortable to use. Why do I give it only 4 stars? After about 3 years the spinning mechanism on the lid came apart on mine. I was able to snap it together but it periodically comes apart. The act of pushing down hard on the mechanism over and over is just tough on a relatively cheap plastic object. All salad spinners have some variant of this problem, though. Pull cord ones get tangled or rotted cords. Crank ones wear out their gears. Go with the Good Grips - they're easy on the hands."
5,"Love it, love it, love it","Really love it, serve salad more often. Love the way it spins the salad greens dry.Had it for about three weeks. Would recommend it to anyone."
5,A kitchen essential...,"I'm going to be eating a lot healthier after getting this great tool, I'll tell you that. I like salads, but my wife and I usually do not make them because of the length of time that it takes to prepare them and clean up, and besides the lettuce usually goes bad within a couple of days. Not so with the Oxo salad spinner. Suddenly, mixing salads has become a piece of cake, with the water going to the bottom. It keeps lettuce dry and crisp in the refrigerator. In short, it makes salads worth the trouble again. One salad can last us pretty much all week, depending on the ingredients. I only wish it was a little bit cheaper, but that's only because I'm a cheapskate. I'd avoid other brands, which have spotty durability records.(Oh, and we put ours in the dishwasher, top rack, without any trouble)."
5,Bullet-proof,"The OXO Salad Spinner is built solid and has proven itself time and again in my kitchen. It's really versatile, also. Heavy-duty plastic bowl and strainer. I don't know how I got by before owning one!"
4,So far so good,"I've never had/used a salad spinner before this, so I don't really have anything to compare it to except for the good ol' fashion manual method.I just received this in a Christmas gift exchange and so far am pretty happy with it. I used it for the first time today to dry some freshly washed vegetables (broccoli, carrots, and bell pepper) and it worked quite nicely. I like that the handle can be pushed down and locked allowing for easy storage in a cabinet with the ability to stack other dishes on top. Also, I like that the bowl and strainer are separate as it is nice to have an extra strainer in the house and allows for easy emptying of the bowl's contents.The reason I give it only 4 stars is 3 fold:1: As with everything else these days, this item is made in China.2: I felt that $24.95 for a kitchen tool was a bit steep, especially considering it is made in China.3: I've only used the product once and cannot attest to its long term durability."
5,25 year replacement,"I accidentally broke my stone after 25+ yeras of usage. I replaced it immediately. Great little stone for quick outdoor (and indoor) usage,"
3,First of a possible 3 sets?!,"I love this series and have been patiently awaiting a release on DVD; however, I was shocked when I finally received it and found it wasn't the complete series. It's not even numbered volume 1 or anything. It was only by reading reviews that I realized that this is the first of a possible three volume series and Shout Factory isn't planning on releasing the other two volumes unless they get good sales from this first one. Bah. Way to drive away the customers, Shout Factory!The series deserves a five-star rating, hands down. Shout Factory's stinginess on releasing the whole series may kill their sales and thus provoke them to not release the other two volumes. Hard-core fans might have to stick to downloading the rare, low-quality, grainy episodes to get their ""Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog"" fix. So overall rating: three stars. Release the rest of the series, Shout Factory!"
4,The first chink in the armor,"I have long stopped listening to CCR, but recently I bought all their Albums again. I loved the tone and sound of this album when it came out. It was different, a bit more time and work seemed to be put into this recording. Now in retropect. If I were to only be able to own two of CCRs albums, it would be this one and their first. The others are filled with AM patter."
5,common sence,"SMALL PHAMPLET, BUT PACKED , THE WHOLE CONTENTS IS IN ONE OTHER BOOK OF HIS, I AM INSPIRED OF ROBERT INGERSOLLS INTELLECT, AND COMMON SENCE!"
1,broken cd,the seller did not communicate or offer refund. in the end he did not even respond. he send me a broken cd. i highly recommend that nobody buys from this person.
5,"Perfect, simply perfect.","I have always been a great fan of John Williams and his music, but my opinion on his music was always mostly based on just Star Wars Trilogy's music (and some Jurassic Park). I then decided to order Raiders of the Lost Ark soundtrack, and I'm glad I did.This CD is simply perfect. After viewing the movie this CD brings back all the plot twists and situations from the film. The music is soothing at times, fast-paced at times, silent when silence is needed. The use of leif-motif is visible on this record as Indy's, Marion's, Ark's, Medallion's and other themes are weaved together into one huge musical cloth.Words aren't enough to describe this music. When I thought Star Wars was inch away from perfection, I was wrong. This record wents mile beyond what Star Wars achieved. God bless John Williams!"
2,Not As Shown,"This item was a gift and I was very disappointed when I received it. The baby frog was so very much smaller than it appeared on Amazon. That said, the item arrived quickly and was well packed. However, it truly was not worth the price, even though it is Swavorski."
1,boring...,"This book was boring. I like some of Kat's books. For me, they are hit or miss. Frankly, the tortured hero and the virgin but passionate miss are getting boring. The ""issue"" at the end of the story should have been settled early on. Extreme sub-par story."
4,Another bestseller for Kat Martin,"Ms. Martin has another bestseller under her belt. Fanning the Flame is the heart-warming, romantic tale of Adam Hawthorne, Clayton's friend in The Fire Inside, and Jillian Whitney.Adam finds himself attracted to the mysterious Ms. Whitney when he sees her every day during his morning rides in the park. As he is drawn to her, he wonders how the innocent angel feeding the ducks could be the same woman rumored to be the mistress of the ancient Earl of Fenwick.When the Earl of Fenwick is murdered, Jillian becomes the primary suspect. She finds herself in the custody of Adam, and she must prove to him and everyone else that she did not murder the Earl of Fenwick. Adam is the one man who could be her saving grace or her fall from grace.This story offers sensuality, romance, and intrigue from page One. You will be pleased by Ms. Martin's writing talents. I actually give this book 4 1/2 stars. I guarantee that you won't be disappointed."
3,Mildy entertaining,"Although it was an okay book, it was not really very memorable. I actually got half-way through the book the second time before I realized it was in the wrong pile and should be with the already-read books.Jillian is accused of murdering her father's friend who has taken her in when she has no family of her own left. When she is discovered over the bloody body, she panics and runs. Luckily Adam runs into her and is willing to take her in and help her find the real murderer. So the usual story ensues- he's bitter over a past betrayal, she falls in love with him but knows marriage is not an option. Blah, blah, she heals his heart, he falls in love, they find the murderer and finally get married. Unfortunately, the murder was not a very big part of the book at all. Sure, Jillian was worried a lot but they did very little to actually solve the murder.Overall, it was okay but not excellent. I wish I'd gotten it from the library, not paid money for it."
1,Dont buy it!,"2 years ago I decided to buy a game console. I didnt know wich one to choose, so I decided to rent one week a playstation and a week a N64. The first week, I rent a Playstation, let me tell you that its a very good game console. Graphics are good, Sound is great, but, games... I dont have much to say about them. I know that there are 500 games coming out each month for PlayStation, but only 1 or luckily 2 of those 500 are good. 2 controller ports are not enaugh. I mean, I once invited 6 friends to my house... we spend hours for giving everyone the chance to play! Well, but the second week was much better. I rent a N64, I played Goldeneye, Mario Kart 64 and lots of other multiplayer games, and belive me thats what I was looking for. Many people say that N64 games are childish, well, for all of them Im 23 years old and I ca'nt stop playng. BElive me buyng a N64 is the best choice. Another extra thing, sound dosent matter, maybe N64 sound is not as good as PSX one, but, well, I dont care."
2,HONEST,"Playstation has lots of games to play (that's good) But many are just the same (that's bad). Many playstation games needs lots of time to play....think, think, find keys, secret hall way, the level was too hard so we spend 3 weeks to finish it... some people may like that...But If U want something exciting, fast and easy choose something from Sega's range..beleve it or not Sega makes 70% of archade games and basicaly are archade experts...over all, a choice between PlayStation and Atari2600....No doubt that ATARI2600 is much more FUN."
5,The best in the US now,"Let's face it. The PlayStation is the best console system in the US. Why? Well, it is because of the awesome games that have been coming out and the wider variety of genres. Have you seen a decent RPG on the N64 or the Dreamcast? Nope. Have you seen a major fighting game franchise (Tekken and Street Fighter) on the N64? No! The only place to find these kind of genres is mostly on the PlayStation. The graphics may look outdated, but it is good enough for someone to enjoy a decent game. Also, the loading times may take long, but I don't really care about it, I'm patient with it. Anyway, buy the PlayStation, it is definitly worth your time."
4,"This system rocks, but reliabilty is VERY questionable","When I bought my first Play Station in 1996 i had so much fun, the choice of games is huge (but not all of them are good) and their are so many people with one there is always some one to play with. But I can question its reliability. The first generation of playstations were plagued with cd and heat problems, the second generation would have problems with FMV sequences of games, finaly they fixed all of that by the third generation. I would recomend a playstation but make SURE its a third generation playstation (it should come with a force feedback remote). PS: The first game you should get, GRAN TURISMO!"
2,not very helpful,"This author said very little with a lot of words. She did not have any original insights into bird behavior. Fairly well known and simple concepts were made complex by her long winded style. Chapter seven, obviously penned by the second author, was the only chaper in the book that I found interesting. It covered very specific techniques and guidelines."
2,not what I had hoped,"I was looking for a book which would help me choose apple trees with regard to their pollinators and disease resistance.This book is a history of apple cultivation. Nice, but without the facts I need to make choices in the present."
4,Insects fighting back,I am a huge fan of Frank Herbert's work. Dune was one of the first science fiction books that I read. As I grew older I started collecting the rest of his work and reading it. This was a very interesting story. A bit odd at times. I would recommend it to a fan of Frank Herbert. None of his other work will ever top the Dune books but this is a quick enjoyable read.
4,A futuristic novel of an impossible earth.,"The ""Green Brain"" is one of F. Herberts fun little novels. It takes place in the future where humans are pitted against nature. It's fun and well worth the reading."
4,"Spiritual, heart felt, lots of experience in Indian culture","I have had Krishna Das' CD for 1 year now. being that I am into yoga and India culture, I highly recommend this CD. Krishna's voice is warm, full of flavor and his songs are joyous and very true to the culture. It makes me feel spritually connected, and Krishna Das makes this easy. I feel transported when I listen to Krishna Das' original music. I highly recommend it."
4,kick ass!,this cd rocks but the singer truly sucks on most tunes he does. the guitar work is excellent the bass & drums typical 80's hair rock beat. this was a under rated cd mostly in part to the singers bad throat in my opinion. the band done well on the follow up cd 2nd coming. they done good to have the bassist do the singing.the cd's strong point the guitar work is truly amazing. best song ... idont care about nothing. the cd comes with a stencel of shotgun messiah dont pay the high price for it if the cd dont have it. its a collectors piece now if you have it.
3,Poor Lock,"I received these as part of a package purchase. Problem is, the tongs do not come together tightly at the tips. If you are going to use a oiled paper towel to coat a grill you have to use a lot of paper towels for the tips of the tongs to take hold. For turning food they are fine."
5,Excellent!,A great all around tool in the kitchen. The locking mechanism is ingenius. You can use this tool to replace almost all other kitchen utensils:)
4,simply put...,"Good tool. Well thought out lock. Keep away from your non-stick cookware though. There are siliconized or plastic coated tipped tongs out there for use there. Very nice, very handy. Get them."
4,"Good quality, easy to use","This size is perfect for everyday use, they are a good quality, the locking mechanism is simple and easy to use. I find I use these frequently for all sorts of things from cooking my homemade pasta (can be fragile) to sauteing vegies."
5,Comfort,"It is so comfortable as all the OXO products are. I have carpal tunnel and adhesive capsulits. The tongs feel great in my hands and are just the right size. I feel no pain when I am using them. I highly recommend these. They are also easy to clean and of course stainless steel as the tongs I did have were rusting, but OXO doesn't. Give it a try, you won't regret it. Very good for arthritic folks. Well worth the price. I only buy OXO products now."
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased these tongs with certainty I was buying the best. I received them on June 26th and by August 10th, they were broke. The arm of the spring popped out which disabled the spring action. So I'm out the money and the tongs. I would like to believe this is an exception, but without knowing this for sure, the next time I buy a pair of tongs I'll take my chances on another brand."
2,Nice while they lasted,"The locking feature was great, it made them much more manageable while in use and for storage. However, the plastic grips starting coming out very soon after I bought the tongs. Not long after that, the locking mechanism broke. This made them very hard to use and store, so we chunked them and bought a different kind. It is probably worth a little extra money to get tongs that last."
5,The best you can buy,"I've had this tongs for more than five years and used them for grilling. They are like new. The spring action is very comfortable, not too hard, not too soft. Do yourself a favor and buy one."
2,Kinda hard to handle...,The thongs are a bit hard to handle for me and I have rather large hands. They also didn't come together perfectly nor did they feel too sturdy although I didn't really test them.
3,They're ok but...,I bought these to replace a pair of tongs that I'd lost. I was disappointed to find that these tongs were so lightweight and the spring isn't very strong. I'm probably going to buy another pair simply because I'm looking for something that comes close to the ones we lost. But these will do in the meantime.
2,Spring Broke...,I loved this set of tongs and was using them for everything... but after less than a month the spring broke.. and they were garbage. I question the listing as dishwasher safe because I can't think of any other reason the spring should have broken. Very disappointed and hesitant to replace them with another pair.
5,Mel Tome Swings Hard and Fast,"This album doesn't stop from the start to the end. It swings loud, hard, and fast. A classic, really shows that Torme was the greatest of his generation of singers! Buy This Album"
2,Great...until it broke...,"For the first couple of months we LOVED this...no more squeezing down to keep the cutting wheel engaged, and it worked like a charm. Recently, though, the cutting blade seems to have dulled or come untrued. The locking mechanism still works, but the opener will wheel itself off of the can without cutting or will move around the can without cutting anything. Because the openers is locked, it's not possible to put much more pressure on this to correct it. Seems like a better plan to get a standard opener or an electric opener if you're avoiding the need for a strong grip."
1,Works poorly and painful to use,"I loathe this can opener. I hate it in a way that I find vaguely disturbing, like I'm anthropomorphizing it. The idea is awesome for people with hurty joints, which is why I bought it. The problem is that a locking mechanism is a lot less useful (and a lot more frustrating) if it takes five tries to get the jaws around the can properly. And when the button locks in a misaligned position (those first four tries) it is extremely difficult to release. My joints hurt a lot but are pretty strong as I'm still in my mid-20s, and I have serious trouble using this. It negates its own purpose by being badly put together."
5,Best Can Opener in the World,"We used this can opener at my cousin's house, and ordered one as soon as we got home. My wife uses it, primarily, to open pet food cans for our dogs and cat. We have tried electric and mechanical can openers, none of which worked very well. This one is great. It opens any can we've tried it on without missing a beat."
4,Deliciously Dark,"I missed this book the first time around because I was 10 when it was published and I was a bit precocious and never one to read at my grade level. I wish I hadn't missed it! I'm a big Lemony Snicket fan, and it's easy to see that he's been influenced by Dahl. This is a little dark and violent, but quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, I enjoyed it more *before* Matilda develops her magical powers, when she was just a really smart child - though Miss Honey's explanation at the end mitigates some of that. I'm looking forward to reading some more of Dahl's works."
1,Matilda is quite a pathetic book,"If Matilda existed and if she really had anything between her ears, she would not like this book. The humor consists of endless repetitions of the scathing insult ""You little twit."" Matilda, who has had no exposure to intelligent conversation and has never heard of mathematics, has an adult vocabulary at two years and can multiply any numbers in a second, not to mention pushing things with her eyes. Roald Dahl's sick humor and pathological desire to revolt are ever-present. The only thing that can be said for it is that it might conceivably encourage children to read more. However, this is no use if readers are bent on, against all common sense, reading Matilda over and over again."
4,Matilda,This book was very adventurous. The book was about magical powers.The girl finds out that she has magical powers.She tells her teacher that and she does not believe her a till she shows her that she can pore the water.The book describes how the girl is feeling about her powers.The author tells what the girl does with her powers.Also the author tells why she is uses her powers and on what.The story is very life like.The book is a fantasy as you can tell.The book is very good and i would recommend this book to any person that enjoys fantasy books.Iwould recommend this book because all kids would love this book.I would rate this book as a very good book.
5,Favorite Chapter Book!,"When I ask my five year old what her favorite chapter book is, she replies with ""Matilda"" every time. Roald Dahl was my favorite when I was a kid, so I couldn't be happier my daughter loves his work as much as I did. Dahl makes books fun. Next up is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory!"
5,Five star kids' book!,I remember reading this as a kid and totally loving it. I recently bought it for my neice and read it again. It brought back fond memories. Mathilda is a very bright little girl whose level of genius goes completely unnoticed by her ignorant parents. It is so funny and Dahl is still the undisputed king of children's fiction!
5,A great tale!,"Unwilling to give up my own copy of Matilda, I bought a copy for my granddaughter, who has come to love the story as much as I. Now I can't wait to take her to see Miss Trunchbull on Broadway!"
5,What a great book!!,"This story takes place at Matilda's school and home in England. Matilda is a very smart girl and with magic power. She went to school and made friends with the teacher. The story talks about all the things happen at school. I love Matilda because she is not just smart, but she is brave too. This book is very funny and scary at the same time. It contains some magic too. IF you like funny story, I bet you will like this one. I highly recommand this book to you."
4,Matilda,"I think this is a great book for kids at age 10 to 13 or 14. I really like this book because it is very interesting and magical.I think that it is much better than the movie or DVD because it has some different information than the movie. I don't understand why they change some parts from the book into the movie. Well any ways Matilda is a very great, interesting, and magical book."
4,good read,I think that if I read Matilda when I was a kid I'd probably like it more. It was a good little read and highly recommended to children.
2,"It was OK as a kid, I despise it now","Like most Roald Dahl books (for me, at least) I thought this was a pretty good book (...), but by only a few years later I've come to really hate it. For a Roald Dahl book Matilda is pretty good-it has an interesting plot, at least.Unfortunately aside from that I hate it. The characters are all either Mary-Sue's or horrible cardboard villains. Matilda is so annoyingly perfect, she taught herself to read as a baby, soon read the kids section of the library, is a complete genius, quite nice, and has telekinesis. Miss Honey, her teacher, is annoyingly sweet and smart. Headmistress Trunchbull and Matilda's parents are ridiculously mean with no attempt whatsoever to make them human and realistic, and no one bothers to explain why Trunchbull got her job or wasn't arrested for her horribleness. And the little humor it has is all dark.(...)"
2,Handle with caution,"At first I thought this would be a good girl's book for Story Time, but I'm sorry to say that it's not so good. None of the mature female characters are good role models: Miss Honey is wimpy, The Trunchbull is cruel, The Mother is indifferent (the Father and Brother, bullies); what's here for a girl to look forward to in adulthood? Nothing good, I daresay.Dahl's rather bizarre idea of girl empowerment encompasses petty revenge and telekinesis; hardly what ordinary girls in the real world can depend on for life skills.One might say, ""Lighten up, it's just a book for fun."" But I suspect that kids or young teens who identify with this book have experienced what Matilda has, and need to find more uplifting literature."
1,Matilda,Do you like mischievous books? Matilda is a silly smart young lady. She was reading chapter books at the age of four. She wanted to go to school and her dad sold a car to a principal so she got to go to school. Her principal is so mean. So she gets back at her principal. Then her dad got in trouble so they moved.I believe you should pass on the book Matilda. Some reasons are I don't understand the text says mum instead of mom and tele instead of t.v. And it just doesn't make sense. Also it leaves you hanging it doesn't give enough information but the information isn't always helpful. Her parents are mean to they don't let her read she can only watch television. That is why you should not read this book.
4,it was all right,"i thought it was a good series, but it left me very confused. i had a lot of questions unanswered. other than that it was an all good series and glad i bought it."
3,charcoal not doing the job,"Good filter with an exact fit, but all the outside odors get inside with no dilution at all. If there's charcoal in these filters it doesn't work."
2,will it fit for my 1998 BMW 528i,"it look to me that it is the air filter I need and I ordered it.after getting it, it is not he same as the old ones. The old oneshave plastic wrap and it will tell the air flow direction without a question.This product will fit, but it took me a while to figure our how to put it in.should have ordered it at [...]and they have youtube instructions and the price might be a few dollars more."
5,Convenient small appliances,It is very convenient. I can store my dish soap in the cabinet instead of putting on the counter top since i have this brush. Very good product.
5,Perfect Dish Washing Tool,"I'll preface by saying I didn't by this oxo palm brush on Amazon, but at Target. It is an amazing, solidly designed little gem that doesn't leak soap like some other brands and shoots a little squirt of soap on command. It actually makes washing dishes a little fun. This is much better and faster than grabbing a bottle of soap and putting it on a brush repeatedly during a dish washing session.The fact that the brush itself is replaceable is a nice touch too."
5,High quality scrubber,"Of all the soap-and-scrubber combinations, this is easily the most rugged. Perfect for cleaning pots you've used to bake in, it fits into every round corner with ease. It fits right in the palm of your hand, so it's particularly good for heavy-duty scrubbing. It's quite unlike OXO's own alternate design, the Soap-Dispensing Scrub Brush. Though you'll get to keep your hands out of the muck with that cleaning wand, it's much weaker and won't let you get into hard-to-reach corners. Spend the extra few bucks and get a soap-dispensing scrubber that can handle the toughest of jobs."
4,Sturdy and very well-designed,"This thing works great for getting dishes clean -- it's sturdy and well-engineered so that you can scrub really hard, and the bristles get into some places a dishrag can't reach.I took off one star because mine leaks a little, whether I store it right side up or upside down. Now I just leave it standing up in the kitchen sink drain, so that doesn't matter."
3,Not as good for DISH scrubbing as I'd hoped...,"... and I just might be the world's biggest fan of the entire OXO Good Grips line. But for me this brush is too short and the bristle part is too fat & too soft. HOWEVER! It turned out to be good for something else... Try filling it with a very good moisturizing hand soap and using it *occasionally* to scrub reeeeeeeally grimy hands/nails. I hate to wear gloves while gardening, even in our red messy clay soil, and Aging SuperHubby is still too macho to wear gloves while D.I.Y.-ing, lol -- so this brush has found a home on our utility sink next to the basement door."
5,Excellent jean and service,"Great jeans, not available in the u.k. Great fit if you have larger than average thighs.Was worried about ordering from .com but it was an easy transaction.Super fast delivery too. Well done Amazon!!"
4,A little long.,"I bought these pants the correct W & L - but they aren't a true 32 in length. So, if you are ordering just know that they run longish. Otherwise they are constructed really well. They fit my husband perfectly and they seem to not shrink at all!"
1,Not worth the money!,"I love the way that these jeans fit, one of the more comfortable pairs of jeans. So why might you ask am I giving these jeans such a low rating.. The last 5 pairs of these jeans that I have bought have ripped within 5 times of wearing them and two of the pairs ripped down the back within 2 months of purchasing them. I take good care of my clothes and have not had any issues with other brands but recently they have started using cheaper thinner fabric on these jeans.. I unfortunately am going to have to switch to a different brand due to the lack of quality. If the price was less then I might expect it but these are marketed as the more premium line yet the use the cheaper fabric.Save yourself the money on these, If the fabric is thin and feels cheap that probably means that it is!"
3,"YOU DON'T UNDRRSTAND, YOU DON'T EVEN CARE",THIS PLAY WAS AWESOME. THE SINGING WAS BETTER THAN THE ACTUAL PLAY. MELONIE DANIAL'S CHARACTER gLORIA WAS MY FAVORITE. I LOVED WHEN SHE SANG HER HEART OUT AND SHE EVEN BETTER IN MADEA GETS A JOB. YOU ARE GOING TO HATE THIS PLAY IF YOU'RE EXPECTING COMEDY. IT'S REALLY SERIOUS.
1,Aunt Bam is the best but not even she can save this play....,"I love Aunt Bam's character. She is the perfect sidekick for Madea and Cassi Davis's comedic timing is amazing, but not even her antics and humor can save this play. Its a little more dramatic and over-the-top than Tyler's usual plays and while the singing is AMAZING, the script and subject of the play is weak and at times way less than entertaining. Hopefully Tyler will do Cassi Davis justice and write a play that is deserving of her skill and presence."
2,for nostalgic beach volleyball fans only,"Watched it on TV because I hung out on that beach for years and still play volleyball. The volleyball scenes weren't too good, edited to hide actors playing deficiencies no doubt. After this movie came out the AVP beach volleyball league went bankrupt. Was it the movie's fault?"
4,a fun beach movie,I enjoyed this movie. It is not an award winner and is a bit predictable. That said it is still fun - a lot lf beautiful California scenes. Those who enjoyed David Charvet from Bay Watch will enjoy this movie. Honest effort in the acting.
5,I Was Wrong Aaliyah is on FIRE!!!!,"I wrote a review on the first day the CD came out and boy was I wrong. I LOVE THIS CD!!! I still don't like #3 but all the rest of the songs are awsome. If you listen to #10 (I REFUSE) and skip to the part where the violins really start to rage (2 minutes 28 seconds). It is awsome! #11 is also another great song! GOD, I love all the songs sooo much. Even if you don't like the first single We Need a Resolution BUY THIS DAMN CD because it is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good!!!! BUY IT...it is worth the $15. Aaliyah is so talented."
3,An okay CD...,"This is actually my least favorite album of Aaliyah's. About half of the tracks are really good, but the other half is nothing that special."
2,Can you say overrated?,"Aaliyah made 3 decent songs, IMO. But other than that, she was unoriginal. She didn't have a great voice like millions claim and she didn't write her own songs. Very average to me. Even Monica has a better singing voice, but no one payed attention to her. Jeez...I wonder why. Aaliyah was mediocre. Great performer, but not a great singer. Get anything by Anita Baker, Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin, Phyllis Hyman, Chaka Khan or Tina Turner. REAL singers. Aaliyah's music was never groundbreaking or new. Basically her team wrote songs that ppl like Jlo, Britney or Ashanti could've sang. And no, this album is not a classic. THe reason why Aaliyah is this so called princess b/c:1. nothing was bad written about her2. she died at 22"
5,A Beautified Masterpiece.,"Aaliyah's new album entitled ""Aaliyah"" is a beautiful work of art. She's got those tight joints produced by Timbaland, but also, slow melodic tunes that could rock you to sleep. I know that when I first got this CD I was so open, and still am; true, most of her songs are not produced by mastermind producer, Timbaland, but I think that it all together shows how much her vocals have grown in the last 5 years. it also lets other creative geniuses like Static from Playa... and her other writers have their place in the sun. Aaliyah truly did a marvelous job on this album. Everyone, please purchase!"
5,AT HER BEST,"Aaliyah's 3rd cd is definitely her best work to date... unfortunately she was silenced in her untimely death. If you like Aaliyah, you'll love this CD. If you were a fan before this cd, you'll be an even bigger fan. Her vocals and interpretations of this 15 song set is incomparable. Her voice is soft, airy and effortless. My personal favorites are It's Whatever, U Got Nerve and I Can Be. I highly recommend this cd, this is one of those rare cd's you can press play and listen to the entire cd over and over."
1,very disappointing!!!!!!,"I expected more of this album. I thought there would have been more hot beats and a little bit more production from Timbaland. Instead, it seems as if she tried to experiment on different things a little bit too much and it backfired badly. The only bright spots on the album are like the first 3 or 4 songs and then the rest of the album goes downhill from there. Don't waste your money!!"
2,Unfortunately disappointed,"I really hoped that this one would be a blast. Her album ""One In A Million"" was definitely already a step in the right direction, especially with the inclusion of Timbaland as a producer on half of that albums tracks. What followed was a string of excellent singles and soundtrack cuts like ""Are You That Somebody,"" ""I Don't Wanna"" and, of course, ""Try Again."" Next to ""Try Again"" (it is included on the German version of her new album) the only other stand-out track on ""Aaliyah"" is ""More Than A Woman,"" once again a collaborative piece with Timbaland. The rest, and I really hate to type it, is disappointing. She is still talented, but she really should look out for better material next time around. She really should go back and ""Try Again"" quite quickly before her star as a singer might fall considerably, and why not work with Timbaland for a whole album for a change? - August 26, 2001: I just heard about the tragic incident and at first I was in shock and disbelief - R.I.P."
3,Aaliyah.,"A good mix of smooth songs from the late singer, and thankfully they were not over-produced like so many other R&B recordings. Aaliyah was definitely maturing as a singer. I have One In A Million and her songs were more about teenage life, clubbing, and boyfriends. My favorites here would be We Need A Resolution, More Than A Woman, and Extra Smooth. The others tend to run together and are pretty average. Notice that Aaliyah was singing about being ""More than a woman,"" while Britney was singing about being ""Not yet a woman."" I'd have to agree. I'm not giving it four stars and because this isn't my favorite type of music. If it's yours, I would recommend it since you'll likely enjoy it more than I."
4,Beautiful CD/Beaufiful Aaliyah/Beauitful Voice,"Tight Cd,Dont have much to say,still sad shes gone =(,but heres how I rate her songs...1.We need a resolution-5 stars2.Loose Rap-2 stars-3.Rock the boat-4 1/2 stars4.More than a women-5 stars5.Never no more-5 stars6.I care 4 u-5 stars7.Extra smooth-4 1/2 stars8.Read between the lines-4 stars9.U got nerve-3 stars10.I refuse- 4 1/2 stars11.It whateva- 3 1/2 stars12.I can be-4 stars13.Those were the days-3 stars14.What if-3 stars"
2,This CD needs a resolution...,"Her fans long awaited this CD, but it's a disappointment to some...like me. To me, ""Aaliyah"" really isn't worth the money. I listened to the CD all the way through, and out of all the tracks on this CD, there are only three of them that sound good. Those tracks would be ""We Need A Resolution"", ""More Than A Woman"", and ""Never No More"". Of course, her first single off this CD was the reason why I went out and bought it. I thought to myself after listening to this, ""I should've gotten the single instead."" I was very disappointed and felt that I wasted my money. It lacks the production that her two previous CDs (""One In A Million"" and ""Age Ain't Nothing But A Number"") had. All the beats and the lyrics on Aaliyah's self-titled CD sound the same, and the lyrics are just plain awful. I recommend you save yourself [price] and go buy the ""We Need A Resolution"" single."
2,good singles but this is album is lacking!,"i Think Aaliyah is talented but i would not call this album one of the best cd's i've ever heard. although the songs like ""rock the boat"" and ""more than a woman"" are really good the rest of the album is (sorry Aaliyah)very lacking, i could even call alot of the songs fillers. I don't think this cd is worth the money, my advice is to get the singles or download the good songs off the filesharing service.ps. i hope they bring out a best of or greatest hits Aaliyah cd, coz i'll be getting that one if it comes out."
4,Last Album Of A True R&B Princess,"Her voice and talent can never be beat and will never be forgotten. However, her earlier albums were much better, lyrically speaking. To see Aaliyah at her best, buy ""One In A Million"" and ""Age Ain't Nothing But A Number."" You WILL NOT be disappointed."
5,Aaliyah,"Aaliyah's new album, is terrific.Even tho she died on August 25, 2002 in a plane crash, her soul & music still lives on forever!!! I decided to buy her new album called ""Aaliyah"" to do a small dedication to her, and so I did. I love this album, just like I love Aaliyah. But I also miss her, all of her fans do *sniff sniff*! Of course we know, that Aaliyah is watching over us always. Anyhow, back to the CD. :-)! All of the songs are great.. My most faves are, rock the boat, more than a woman, extra mooth and i care 4 u! I reccommend you all get her new album.. and do a dedication to her by buying it, like I did. :-) ""This album is beautiful Aaliyah, and I/we miss you!"""
5,I Was Wrong Aaliyah is on FIRE!!!!,"[....] I LOVE THIS CD!!! I still don't like #3 but all the rest of the songs are awsome. If you listen to #10 (I REFUSE) and skip to the part where the violins really start to rage (2 minutes 28 seconds). It is awsome! #11 is also another great song! GOD, I love all the songs sooo much. Even if you don't like the first single We Need a Resolution BUY THIS DAMN CD because it is sooo [...] good!!!! BUY IT...it is worth the [price]. Aaliyah is so talented."
3,"A real nice effort, not a 'hit' though...","This album won't be on any 'must buy-lists' of 2001. That's a fact. But then again, is that really necessary? There are some great tunes here ('We Need A Resolution' is brilliant and 'More Than A Woman' has real power) and Aaliyah shows she's matured a great lot. But that's about it... Timbaland's tired of making million dollar songs, Missy's tracks are without inspiration whatsoever and Static from Playa delivers a great job but all his tracks sound the same. The girl has an axcellent voice but should find some new songwriters and spend less time on the big screen (although none of us complain about that, right?). And what's up with putting 'Try Again' at the end?"
4,More Than a Woman,"It's a shame Aaliyah had to leave us the way she did. I bought this cd because I liked her ""one in a million"" cd.This collection is unique and not what I expected to hear from Aaliyah but it's still cool. My favs are More Than A Woman and We Need a Resolution."
5,Aaliyah cd purchase,I purchased a used cd and the process was wonderful. I recommend it to everyone. There were no glitches or problems. I received the cd much faster than I expected. It arrived about 3 days later.
5,AALIYAH,I LOVE THIS ALBUM.ITS NOT ONLY MY FAVORITE AALIYAH ALBUM.ITS MY FAVORITE OUT OF MY TOP FIVE ALBUMS.AALIYAH WAS TOTALLY HERSELF ON THIS ALBUM.YOU CAN PLAY THIS CD WITHOUT SKIPPING THROUGH SONGS.RIP BABY GIRL
5,Aaliyah at her best,This is Aaliyah's best album definitely. She was an incredible entertainer with an equally incredible voice and she shows that in this album. Unfortunately we'll never know if she had even better under her sleeve. RIP Aaliyah..
5,"Aaliyah,an angel","This album is amazing.You will never get tired of this CD.Eventhough,this CD has adult topics and i'm a kid I thought the beat was tight the lyrics were amazing and the way she sings is extrodinary.Seriously,BUY THE CD!Don't wait!Aaliyah is one of the best R&B artist in the world (my opinion).Once you listen to her music you feel kind of sad but she is a must buy.Aaliyah a.k.a babygirl is with us forever;)"
5,"Gone, Never Forgotten","Her death aside, this album is extremely satisfying - for the first time we see Aaliyah as a mature woman, one whose sophistication and class have always seemed older than her real age anyway (in this case, 22). On her last album, she was smart enough to employ the then-up-and-coming songwriting and producing skills of Timbaland and Missy ""Misdemeanor"" Elliott, two amazing artists who helped to keep Aaliyah on the cutting edge of R&B. There are a few Timbaland/Missy tracks here, but the greatest tracks on ""Aalyah"" are written and produced by other producers-to-watch: Static from Playa, Rapture and E. Seats. Best tracks: ""We Need a Resolution,"" ""Rock the Boat,"" ""More Than a Woman,"" ""U Got Nerve,"" I Can Be,"" ""What If."" Definitely one of the best R&B albums released this year. It is such a tragedy that this will be the last Aaliyah album we'll hear."
4,The Clue in the Embers,"I really enjoyed reading this book, it was action packed, full of adventure with all your favourite characters, funny in places and I loved every minute of it."
4,Good&banging,this album has all of the trademark Gap funk.The Horns aren't no joke.this band can do many styles&SUcceed.This album is still good.but they got even better with time.Charlie Wilson has Influenced a whole Generation.ask R.Kelly? or Aaron Hall?
3,Disappointing,"This pretty gong is high-maintenance for very little sound. I hung it on a lightly-breezy location of my lanai/porch but it rarely sounded. The cord/ball often twisted to the wrong side, making it impossible to sound, and I often found myself flipping it back to the right position...but I still rarely heard it. Several months later, a string broke and the metal dented after falling. Great idea, but way too expensive just for the concept."
3,why protools and a producer can make anyone sound like a genius,"This little girl (and most among her generation) are getting a little too much credit. Hi, I'm Kelly Osborne, let's make a record. Where's my studio, where's my songwriter, where's my producer, where's my studio band, where's my stylist, where's my make up artist, where's my video director, where's my photographer. Let's not forget the army of talented veterans who make her who she is. This is glossed over 80's retro that was cooler when it was blondie or berlin. It's not that it's bad, but people are commending a girl who has a fairly decent voice but a very big name."
3,Surprisingly Not Bad At All (3.5 out of 5),"It seems that this album is the joke of the year, just because of the fact that its Kelly Osbourne.Well, push that fact aside and add in the ""synth 80s sound"" and you suprisingly have a good 3.5 / 5 star album by her.From her sound of her first single ""One Word) to the end of the album, Lida Perry (who worked with kelly on the vast majority of the album) and Kelly seem to make a good pair.Kelly is not a songbird when it comes to the ""singing"" part, but the ""beats"" and some of the lyrics (hear SUBURBIA and DONT TOUCH ME for some examples) make up for it, some even co-written by Kelly herself. RED LIGHT and SECRET LOVER are also some good ones on here. The song sounds itself are a ""reminiscence"" of the 80s sound.So give it a listen or 2 and hear it for yourself. Hoo-Rah to Kelly!3.5 out of 5 Stars"
4,Electro-Glitter-Trash... lovely.,"I really enjoyed this album...If you like ""One Word"", then you'll enjoy the rest. ""Don't Touch Me While I'm Sleeping"" is a very good track as well as ""Redlight""... Go Kelly, I like this image and sound much better. :)"
4,Brand New?,I first saw them on BET Jazz--singing one song and fell in love with them. I like this cd a lot!
3,Does not fit all bottles,"Oxo products are always good quality and this one is no exception. It is well-designed, easy to grip and sturdily made. I always choose to buy Oxo brand items over other brands.My only complaint is that this bottle brush doesn't actually fit into any of the bottles I want to clean. I selected it to clean my collection of unusual, pretty bottles - some of them quite old - that I use for flowers. The neck size of all these bottles is too narrow for this brush. This wasn't made clear in the description. If you are looking for a bottle brush to use on narrow-necked bottles - look elsewhere."
3,"Nice bottle brush, but ONLY for WIDE mouth bottles!","This bottle brush is well made and GREAT for most things, but it has a THICK stem that will NOT go into regular size water bottles, so don't buy it for that! I tried to use it on the VOSS water bottle I use (recycle,) and for spice bottles, and my sport jug - it was hopeless. You need a regular old fashioned ""baby bottle"" brush with the thin wire stem for regular drinking bottles. OR TRY this incredible brush:Way Clean 33030 Bottle Brushwhich is under four dollars AND has a thinner shaft to fit more bottles, glasses, etc, and which is SLANTED to facilitate a thorough cleaning!"
2,Not Exactly as Advertised,"This bottle brush was presented as ""ordered by others"" when I selected Thermos Nissan 61oz Stainless Steel Bottle. Problem is, it's too short, doesn't reach the bottom of the bottle."
3,Not what I wanted but it's ok for other things.,"I wanted a brush for cleaning beer bottles for making beer. this is not the right brush for the job. I read up on it but I must not have caught the details to cue me as to what kind of bottles.- This product does appear to made quite well with a blister maker grippy handle and resilient bristles. I like OXO products. If it had fit the beer bottles I would have awarded another star. I will keep it and use it for other things, But to my fellow beer makers....we must search further into the Amazon for a proper brush. Blessed be the beer makers..and the brew they make."
5,Absolutely adequate,"This bottle brush, also known as a glass-cleaner-for-folks-with-big-hands, is absolutely adequate for the job it was purchased for. No more squeezing my hand into unnatural shapes to clean the bottom of the glass!"
5,So far so good,"I just got this product yesterday. I used it to clean out 4 of my water bottles and their lids. Along with a long handle, the brush has bristles that stick up on the top and allow me to clean the bottome of the bottle very easily. The brush also cleaned up under the rim of the bottles easily due to the direction of the bottom bristles. It rinsed off easily and dried quickly. So far, so good. If it falls apart within 6 months I'll revise my review; otherwise I'd recomend it for cleaning water bottles/baby bottles/etc."
4,"Good value, soft bristles","This is a nice brush, and with the Good Grips features with are ergonomic and soft to the touch.The only thing I find is you can't put much pressure behind your cleaning stroke, as the bristles are so soft. They just buckle under any kind of pushing. For cleaning water bottles it's great but if you want to clean a stainless steel travel mug, such as the excellent Contigo line,Contigo AUTOSEAL Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Tumbler, 16 Ounces, Blackand there are coffee or tea stains (like in mine) then this brush isn't going to have much oomph to help abrade the stains away. Next I'll try baking soda or vinegar and see how that goes. But soap and soft bristles ain't cuttin' it. It might not matter even with stiffer bristles. I saw one brush that looked nice with some stiffer bristles, but...$92.00? Can that be right? Anyway, I'll update after I try some baking soda or other help to get the tea stains out."
5,Flexible and Sturdy,"Fantastic water bottle brush. The Oxo brush is exactly what I hoped a brush made by this naufacturer would be, attractive, sturdy, and lexile enough to get into both small mouthed bottles and under the neck/shoulders of the bottle. Every time I use this, make water bottle, which I use to store freshly made juices, comes out like new clean. The briskes are not abrasive, so they leave no scratches on the bottle, something that I have experienced with other brushes. I highly recommend this product and will most definitely buy again the next time I'm in the market for a bottle brush."
2,Doesn't fit into bottles,"Decent quality. It would just be nice if it actually fit into real, honest-to-god bottles (and not just the wide-mouthed containers it seems to be made for)."
1,won't fit most bottles,"It is very misleading to say this fits bottles. No, it fits baby bottles. Not typical bottles. Not beer, wine, olive oil, etc. etc. bottles."
4,Just long enough for a half-gallon milk bottle,"This brush cleans a half-gallon milk bottle, but it's -just- barely long enough. If it had another two inches of handle, it would be five-star for this use."
1,Worked for less than 3 weeks,"Bought and carefully installed one of these to replace the original fill valve in a Mansfield toilet. Worked fine at first, then after a couple of weeks the tank would no longer fill. Took the cap off and determined that the lever movement was impeded by the seal failing to seat itself correctly in the cap. Called customer support, the rep suggested that I could try picking up a replacement seal at the store. Keep in mind that the original fill valve in this toilet worked for 16 years without a problem. So I went to the store -- to return my purchase."
4,It is an improvement,This is an improvement to the tank valve I replaced.and it was included as a premium when I ordered the spindles. I also neede a tank valve.
1,missing parts could leave you high and (not) dry,"This assembly may not come with all the parts you need. According to the instructions, there are four possible types of toilet water lines in your bathroom. This assembly includes the parts necessary for two of them. When you get to the instruction for attaching the water line, they say (paraphrasing): if you've got line type 1 or 2, use the included parts X and Y. If you've got type 3 or 4, we didn't give you an X or Y for that type, so reuse the old X and Y from your old assembly. Hey guess what guys: IF MY OLD ASSEMBLY HAD ALL ITS PARTS IN WORKING ORDER I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO BUY YOURS! How about selling an assembly that includes all the parts necessary to replace the old one, rather than assuming some of the previous parts can be reused!"
5,Very Useful,I first saw this book at the library and had to go out and get my own copy. It helps cover the basics of writing a simple short story to a novel in comic format.
4,"Good Material, Lacking Translations","I picked this up since it had pretty favorable reviews. Having finished it I can say it was worthwhile to buy. There are a lot of good tips and advice for writing stories regardless of genre. I'm not even sure why it's labeled as ""Shojo"" outside of being part of a series since the tips are applicable for all genres. It's divided into short easily-digestible chapters that you can try out once you're done and it does a good job building on ideas each chapter. My only caveat is that the translation isn't very good in places and some phrases come off as too generic or repetitive. While reading it I kept feeling like there was probably more subtle aspects to each lesson that didn't make it through translation."
4,finally,"finally all the earlier tracks, remixed and original versions, on a complete album!!More instrumental-stuff, no lyrics, this is what I was looking for!"
2,Not what I expected,"This lamp requires a special size S bulb, not the standard size bulb. Also, the MAXIMUM wattage you can get is 40W. Personally, I need a brighter light than 40W. Other than this, it looks to be a good product (I will be sending mine back). These details are not mentioned under the product specifications as they should be."
2,Missing Zamfir Music,"This would have been the only reason I would have bought it, but it's missing from the soundtrack. Luckily I found this track on the Kill Bill Vol 1 album."
4,The best movie from the 80's!,I love the first Karate Kid film out of all three the others suck. But I am still trying to find this soundtrack. Because every music store I go to doesn't have the Karate Kid CD in stock and I don't know why. But if I find the score accidently I wouldn't mind having it because the music is beautiful and it's originally played by Bill Conti and the songs are awesome. I was quite disappointed that they didn't have the song Cruel Summer on there from the track listing. But I don't have to worry about that song since it's already on the Romy and Michele's High School Reunion soundtrack that I got. I hope they re-release a Karate Kid 2 soundtrack because I like that song Glory of Love. The Karate Kid is a great movie and it's better than the others. The others are kind of dumb stick with the first one.
2,Not the best!,"Loved the film when it first came out and have seen it many times since. There is only one song on this CD that creates the excitement experienced when you watch the movie, You're The Best, and for me, it was worth getting the CD for just that song."
2,Jams and you can't clear it,"I bought this for putting up xmas lights. It ran through about 100 staples, jammed up, and there is no way to take it apart to clear the jam, so now it's a paper weight. A real piece of junk. It says it is made in USA, I doubt it (quality is Chinese) but if it truly is, no wonder US businesses are fading fast."
1,used three times... jams within one minute every time now. Junk.,Second Arrow stapler I've had... both broken within a year. DO NOT BUY ARROW UNLESS YOU ONLY NEED A ONE TIME USE TOOL.
1,Iggy Pop fan? - Then don't bother...,"I am a dyed in the wool Iggy Fan, and love all of Iggy / Stooges material from 1969 throughout (Ave. B is so so though). Wake up suckers is very poorly recorded, and the quality and sound levels change from track to track. Iggy sounds really wasted on several tracks, and even forgets the lyrics to Gimme Danger ! You are way better off buying Iggys studio albums and Raw Power. Especially get FUNHOUSE! Unbeleivable stuff for 1970 ! Also New Values, and Soldier are supreme IGG-Monster."
2,meh.,slow shipping not to mention the tin case was all bent up and wont close properly. wasnt sealed but at least it got here. thanks for the damaged product.
3,Good enough,"The smaller long standard bit bent fairly easily on me (first use), but the other was fine. A must-have for removing the intake manifold from the throttle body of my old A-body car."
3,A SNORE WITHOUT THE TOOT,"I suppose if there is such a thing as an Irish day spa, this is what they are probably playing. Beyond that application, I can see no use for this music. Relaxing, maybe. Tedious, definitely."
4,Challenging Irish Music,"Other than the choppiness of some really short songs, this album really wrings good Irish soul. Knopfler himself doesn't appear out front very much (The Long Road being an exception), with Uellian pipes taking center stage most times. It challenges you, especially ""Love and Guilt"" but yields much. I think The Long Road may be the best song Knopfler has ever written. Yes, better than ""Money For Nothing""!"
2,grout brush,"My home based company, doing ceramic and stone restorations, has used these grout brushes for years and were VERY happy with the product until the company, OXO, decided to change the look and texture of the bristles. What you see pictured to the right is not the brush you receive, but rather the old version. The new design has an altered head shape and the bristles are much softer and splay apart quickly like the cheaper versions found at the large box stores. In the past I have gotten the pictured version at Ace Hardware for the price of about $8.00, exspensive but because of their bristle sturdiness well worth the price. My question is this....OXO, why change a functual design, and Amazon, why not update your web site with the current picture of the product?"
3,Good Product,"I use it to help keep the grout in my bathroom clean. It is a good, nice, easy to work with product."
3,GForce,"I bought this DVD for my grandchildren. They love animal related shows, so I thought this would be good for them. I was wondering if at ages 3 & 4 they would be too young for it, however. They now have seen parts of it, enjoyed what they saw, and were not frightened by it. As they grow older, I am sure they will watch it again and again. I thought it was pretty funny."
1,If You Hate Your Kids: Smells Worse Than a Dirty Hamster Cage...,"Wait, stop! I know what you are thinking: ""This film is obviously bad, why on Earth did you watch it?""Now, this film could have worked, if the correct approach was taken. Nope, I don't know what that approach would be; but this film took the wrong one. The cheesy jokes, the bad acting, and the ridiculous story all contribute to this film's failure.Sadly, I watched the entire film, and the last few parts were the worst. Giant explosions and a giant robot attack the wise-cracking guinea pigs. But thisscene was actually kind of boring.skip it."
4,Cute Movie!,"Very cute, as most talking animal movies are! This was a nice action flick as well, and my son really enjoyed it. Appealed more to him then his 3 year old sister."
5,Music's Holy Ghost,"buy this album. simply put, you could not spend you're money better on any other single cd purchase. this is the album everyone searches for they're entire life. when you pop it in and ""concrete seconds"" starts up. you get a good feeling. by the end of this first track you realize why people drink to excess. This is one in a thimble full of albums in this world that invokes the feelings you've strived for all you're life.This is music's Holy Ghost. I promise you, by the end of the first track you'll want to weep with happiness.download this song: Penelopeand if you love that song be sure to search for the elusive acoustic cover of it by Saosin (i know i know Saosin doean't do slow songs...with this exception). available only as a leaked demo on the internet and nearly as good as the original if not more depressing."
5,Thanks!,This item came undamaged. The person I gave it to really likes it as he is a jazz junky. Thanks!
5,Still hot stuff,"In reading about this one, even after taking the ruler out, I had a ""picture"" in my head of a smaller unit. Still, once I did the forehead slap, the piece has served just in an outstanding manner. It' holds the small tools and little junks I need when out playing photographer.It is of a reasonable size that still allows you full movement without hinderance. It holds all the junk I want to put in it, goes off and on the Adventure 9 bag (or belt) with zero problem.All in all, other than my mental misconstruction, this ""pocket"" has been a delight."
4,Handy Scrubber,"Perfect size for scrubbing fruits and veggies. Plus, it is dishwasher safe and sturdy!"
4,Good but not one I'd rave about,"It's good enough that I'm keeping it.It seems durable. The black rubbery grip is very sturdy feeling. I feel like the bristles are tough enough to work for many months.I was expecting it to be more flexible and softer on the grip. For the price, I shouldn't have expected what I did, but I did because of high reviews here. The bristles are flexible but not the grip. I wanted one that was conforming a little to my hand, so it was more comfortable to use.This is good enough. When I'm ready to get rid of this one, I hope to find a better one without paying a fortune."
2,Way too harsh,"I bought this brush after reading the reviews by others saying this brush was firm but flexible enough to clean potatoes without causing damage. I just tried the brush and I will not be using it again, it is far too harsh and scrubbed gashes into the red potatoes I am roasting right now. I most certainly would not use this brush on mushrooms and am unlikely to use it again on potatoes either. I am very disappointed."
3,Good job by Gary.,"Reviewer Kael said it all about two songs that, alone, are reponsible for me downgrading two stars from this otherwise remarkable album by one of the most underestimated guitarists ever. OUT OF MY SYSTEM is so bad, but so bad, I think for you to have an idea compare it to a bad Poison song... It's a cheap and half-hearted attempt at sounding totally pop / hair metal. No wonder in the original pressings of this album (in CD format), this song was not included.But, to compensate for it, we have som gems here, ""Military Man"" being the best."
3,The last of the hard ones,"Run for cover is the last HARD ROCK album of Gary moore before he released the not great at all Wild Frontier(too much Keyboards)and then went back to his roots:the blues.On this album Gary Moore shares the vocals with Glenn Hughes and Phil Lynott, which is certainly good news, it also features Phil Lynott's last recordings OUT IN THE FIELDS and MILITARY MAN.Run for cover contains very good HARD ROCK songs, strongly re-enforced by Moore's brilliant guitar job, but most of the tracks on this album are NO MORE than good HARD ROCK and I probably expected more from Moore, Lynott and Hughes.Also a ""remake"" of Empty rooms, quite useless.Not a bad album but weaker than Victims of the future, corridors of power or Dirty Fingers.3 and 1/2 stars would be a better rate...so yes depending on the fact that you already own a previous HARD MOORE album or not, that would be a 3 or 4 stars."
1,Ignorance at it's finest.,"This book is the most utter waste of paper ever. It is written from a single view point which is limited in knowledge. The problem with this book is that people are just trying to pinpoint one thing for the teenagers troubles, but in fact the biggest problem would be lack of understanding on the part of people such as the author. How is it that one can blame a game such as Dungeons & Dragons for something like this when no other report has ever been made which is even the least bit similar to this. DO NOT read this book if you have more than a pea for a brain."
4,canvas dvd,The movie was sad but educational. I wish they showed more symptoms of the disorder instead of a just a little bit.
2,It needs frequent tightening,"It works wekk once assembled, but every months or so, from people using it or bumping it, the arm that holds the paper loosened, and must be tightened, or it falls apart. WIll be looking for a replacement."
5,One of the Albums of the year,"Always esoteric and overly self-indulgent and with too much emphasis on music for musicians,The Tea Party has finally reigned in their flights of fancy and technical tangents with the help of Bob Rock.The same man who put Metallica over the top with the black album,Rock focuses the energies of Jeff Burrows,Stuart Chatwood and Jeff Martin.One can only be ""experimental"" for so long,toned down are the dark minor key,depression inducing tracks(some rambling and without focus) of old,replaced with tight accessable songs that soar with great riffs,melodies and rythms.One of THE albums of the year.If you do not buy this CD you will never know what you are missing."
5,"Brilliant Album, negative reviews here should be trashed!","This Album, is without a doubt the single most impressive collection of songs I've heard in the last 5 years.I don't understand all the mixed reviews I'm reading here! Are you people deaf or something? Are you sad there's a lack of depressing songs on this album? There is real depth to their production sound on this album (And that has been lacking throughout their career) Just play Edges of Twilight for a few songs, then throw Seven Circles on, it will blow you away.This is truly an album you can listen to over & over again in the car without getting bored.I'm going to see them live next month on a Wednesday night and I cant wait..."
2,Where's the Tea?,"I have been a long time fan of The Tea Party. I have all the official releases and still listen to all of them up to now. I have come to expect a change in the music and feel of the band. What I wasn't prepared for was this. Of all the releases I have to say that this is the one I don't listen to. The only two tracks I do listen to are Writings on the Wall, and Seven Circles. It's not a lack of musical talent or substance, rather a lack of good quality sound. Although I am saddned by the news of the band breaking up, I take comfort in knowing that they will not continue if this is whats to be expected. For those of you who are new to TTP go and get The Edges of Twilight and Transmission. The others albums are great, but you must first become a fan to appreciate them"
1,Terrible,"An experiment:1. Listen to ""Splendor Solis"", ""Edges of Twilight"", ""Alhambra"", and ""Transmission"".2. Next, listen to ""Triptych"", ""Interzone Mantras"", and ""Seven Circles"".3. Which group of albums churns your stomach raw???Something between Transmission and Triptych occurred that radically altered the Tea Party's musical vision, but I can't begin to imagine. Nonetheless, The Tea Party is no longer a band I musically respect. ""The Seven Circles"" embodies a form of music that I find repugnant. The party is indeed over.This album is TERRIBLE."
5,Probably his best.,"The Holdsworth solos on this CD are out of this world. This CD is probably the most complete work by JLP. Worth the price. Great band. Good songs. Excellent concept. There's not too much synth-work on here so don't worry, it does not sound dated."
3,This was a good book~but it was hard to get into reading it,"I guess for the fact that I had liked the book that I first read before this one so much, that it was really hard to enjoy and get into this book. But then after the 200 page mark it got a lot better. I still will rate this book with a three just for the fact that it was an average book not awesome but not the worst one either. I would however, recommend this book to others~ but also don't read One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest before it."
2,A good book but i did not enjoy reading it.,I personally did not enjoy this novel. From the very beginning there was nothing to really keep me going. I did not even completely understand what was happening for several chapters. I give credit to the author as she came up with a radical story idea but it was not the type of book for me. I did not enjoy reading about what Offred was forced to do with the commander. There were also so many questions of mine that did not get answered. What ever happened to her husband Luke? what about her daughter? The Handmaid's Tale is interesting in the fact that it all revolves around what used to be the United States. I think that the way it was written was another reason why i did not enjoy the novel. Some of the sentence structure and language confused me. Overall i think it was a good book but i did not enjoy reading it. I would recommend it for older people who are interested in politics.
1,terrible writing style and unbelievable story,"This author doesn't understand what a sentence is and how to complete one. Half of pages are filled with one 'sentence' making it incredibly difficult to follow the unnecessarily long, winded descriptions of menial objects and detail. Also, the whole idea of a post-American society dominated by a repressive Christian group is totally ludicrous and I found myself laughing at the absurdity of the story throughout many points.1 star: one of the worst books I've ever read."
2,Steaming pile of chick book,She's a good writer. Maybe it's the company she keeps. Anyone who likens this to 1984 or Brave New World is a twit. That's one of the tests you can keep in your toolkit.
3,WOW TALK ABOUT DISTURBING!,"Maybe it was the fact that im just a gcse student studying the book in english class, but i seriously found this book disturbing! I understand that Atwood wrote the book to show what our future could lead to. But to be honest thats a very scary thought!! Will our society gradually turn into such a disturbing dystopia?? In fact I agree with Conor Cruise O'Brien's view from The Listener-'Moving, Vivid, Terriying, I only hope it's not prophetic'"
2,"I really found this book disgusting, confusing, and morbid.","I had to read this book for english class at school. I reallydidn't like it. I found it confusing how offred went back and forthfrom present time to her old life. It was disgusting how she discribed the ritual for her to get pregnant. What kind of author would actually write about beig a handmaid, especially if it's not true? I heard there's a movie that's based on the book, and they end different. Thank goodness the commander doesn't die in the book like the movie, that would have made me hate this book more. I can't believe people would actually enjoy this book. I think your ratin was rather high, seeing as it's kind of a strange topic."
2,Inexplicably overrated,"Neither subtlety nor realism necessarily rank among the most important ingredients of a successful polemic, but one largely devoid of both cannot claim much merit. Having said that, it is just about possible to read Atwood's book against itself as a parody of a certain sort of contemporary American feminist writing.The saddest thing about 'The Handmaid's Tale' is that Atwood is clearly a highly intelligent, educated and cultured individual. She *must* know *herself* that 'HT' is ludicrously over the top. Why on earth she chose to offer it to a publisher remains a mystery to me."
2,"Dull, ham-fisted, excessive","I would have given 3 stars, as it was merely dull, ham-fisted, and in a writing style I don't appreciate, but I've decided to start dropping a star from any book not about WWII which brings Nazis to bear, whether as the ""bad guy"" in a thriller or as here, simply a long recollected passage meant to draw parallels with the protagonist's own dystopia - if you need to mention Nazis for me to understand that the regime is evil, you're doing something wrong. (Copied from my Goodreads review)"
2,Loved the premise but....,"Definitely an interesting concept however the manner in which this story is told just really isn't my cup of tea. I made myself finish although I wanted to set the book aside a quarter of the way through it. I found it to be cumbersome, at time difficult to follow and ultimately quite boring.I'm the first to admit that it looks like my opinion is in the minority. Different strokes for different folks, I guess."
4,new twist on dystopias,"It's about time someone wrote a dystopia from a female perspective. Governments are usually run by men who don't think for a minute about being a woman, which causes law-making to be biased. If this situation would ever arise in our society, one can be sure of who would take over, and who would be left to obscurity. Atwood has taken writing to a form of the highest art, with her amazing word twists and mind games. Probably my favorite dystopian novel, in which the main character has not only a brain, but an imagination and a memory."
3,Strange story,"This really made me think. Religion can be this evil if not kept in checked. Overall, I enjoy reading it."
3,Everyone read this!,"I think The Handmaid's Tale was horrific because of the way Atwood portrays the ""past"" so casually and the fact that their past is our present and that, at any moment, this world of ours could collapse into such desperation that the government would strip women of all rights and downsize them into machines useful for one thing....babies."
1,"dull,but futuristic",well all i have to say about this book is that to me it sucked. no matter how futuristic it got or how good it attempted to get it just couldn't hold my interest. the historical notes did alot for me but it still didn't make me remember this book. definitly not one of my favorites. i wouldn't ever read this book again i can tell u that for a fact. jacki.a
4,How could she have known?,"Margaret Atwood copyrighted ""The Handmaid's Tale"" in 1985. How could she know then that by 2004 this nation would be dangerously rushing toward the reality she foresaw? In 1985, the only way she could envision the government of the US being taken over by religious idealogues was through violence (assassinating the president, machine-gunning the Congress). How could she know that 20 years later the government would be usurped from within?I think this book should be required reading for any United States citizen who may be concerned about the direction our present administration is taking the government. It's very scary and not at all implausible."
2,Scary but not realistic,"If you're one of those people who gripe about how bad today's world is - read this book! It illustrates a society in which women are nothing but breeding machines. The government controls everything. Real love is unwanted. It is shocking to see how close many muslim countries are to this scenario. However, this would never happen in the U.S.A.. Why? Because personal freedom is a fundamental right every American believes in. We wouldn't let it get this far."
2,Wake me when it's Over.,"I'm not wild about the book, because it scares me. I believe I've heard the type of situation such as the one in the book called a ""distopia""I suppose our society turning so fanatical could happen.It happened in Afghanistan with the Talliban. Personally the thought is horrifying. All personal freedoms are limited. People who disagree are killed, all in the name of religion."
3,slow,"I picked it up because of an article about it being banned for high school. The reasons it was being considered banned, adult content, I have not really found to be the case, but I do not think it is a good book for a high school student. Mainly it is very slow and boring. The main characters life is boring and the author does a good job bringing that across in the book. When you have nothing to do for most of the day you tend to day dream or fall back on old memories and that is what a great majority of the book does. It makes for an interesting read if you can get past the slowness and the constant flash back to a better time."
5,Unexpectingly enjoyable book,"This book I had to read for school and I was very much hoping it would be at least a little good. Luckily, it exceeded my expectations. Atwood's writing style of switching from past to present and not revealing all of what's happening in the story makes you want to constantly read the book and crave more information. Now, this book is rather depressing and doesn't contain a very happy ending, but the tragedy and mystery behind the main character's life gives you a sense of enjoyment from the book."
1,The hand maids tail,The story was about all I liked. It all-around too much and really did not let you know what was going on. I found it very hard to follow most of the time.
1,The Handmaid's Tale,"I bought the audio book for my wife since she loved the book. She was very disappointed in this abridged edition. It is mainly sound effects and dramatization, not what was expected."
1,A appaulingly unplausible novel covering a beatin topic,The skills of the writer lacked to the point of boredum and her attempt at establishing a stable premise at which to convey the ways in which this ridiculus world came about are not present. Socialogical factors are not even represented throughly. Reading the novel you need to forget about 80% of the population. And if i have to read one more book about social roles god save us all
2,Mediocre at best,"As Sci Fi books go this is a poorly written one. Doris Lessing once remarked that if you want to write literature in this day and age it has to be in the form of science fiction. Viewed in this light this is mrs Atwoods first attempt at writing literature and she shows here she does not (yet) have the writing ability. This book barely rises above the level of a feminist pamphlet, if that.For a properly written book on this theme see Suzette Haden Elgin's 'Native Tongue' (and sequels)."
5,Superb novel - among the best I've read,"Great story, stunning use of the language. Every line is poetry, yet with no loss of clarity. As important a dystopian novel as ""1984"" or ""Brave New World"" -- but with superior prose. A must-read."
5,In my top five best books,"This book still stands the test of time. In fact, in light of recent events, it sadly become more relevant. The first time I read this book, I read it straight through in 8 hours. Could not put it down. I've re-read this book since many times. I can only say that about a handful of books."
3,Enjoyable,"I liked reading this book, but it has a very cut off ending. This book would have been a lot better if the author had wrote a few more chapters to wrap things up better.** spoiler alert ** This book is set in the US in the near future. Woman are used for breeding, because some kind of disaster has hurt the human race. Many woman are unable to have children, and those who can have a high chance of their baby not surviving.This book could have been a lot better with more details. It is never said what kinda of disaster happened, although a nuclear clean up is mentioned.I also would like to have more details on who was behind this change in society. Who froze the bank accounts? Who were all these guards?The ending was also poor. The main character is trying to get pregnant though-out the book, but never does."
4,let this awaken us all,This novel has so many striking similarities to what is happening now in Afghanistan it is eerie. I found it compelling and insightful. This type of dystopian society does exist on earth and Margaret Atwood does a spectacular job of bringing it to her readers attention. How horrid it must be to be fearful for your life do to one's own thoughts and beliefs. I realize this is a fictional novel but it scares me none the less
4,Liked it.,"But I didn't love it. The ending drove me nuts (but I won't blurt it out, for those who aren't there yet). Overall, it was well written, if a little trite."
1,I didn't care for this at all.,"How funny to see this book as Amazon's ""Kindle Daily Deal"". My brother gave me an autographed copy back in '86. Perhaps I'd see it differently now but I found it depressing and of no interest to me. I read it only because my brother gave it to me. I didn't even keep it. Don't know if I gave it to a thrift store or what.I was surprised this is a well known author. I prefer biographies or 'true life' stories so perhaps it just 'wasn't my cup of tea'. Kind of wished I'd have kept the book now."
1,a traumatizing experience,"maybe she's a popular and celebrated author of our culture, but I can't go with the popular view on this one. There is no good reason to read this book. It is just another way to get off for the men who believe this way of life would be great for them and want to keep things as conservative as they can already, and it is just another way for women to get traumatized by reading this. I was actually traumatized by this book. Women know the problems with society, and this book offers nothing helpful; it simply adds to the pain. If you are an adult, feel free to damage your soul some more by exposing yourself to more pain and violence. Under no circumstances should a minor read this book. I am a progressive liberal, by the way. But I also know how to see the truth and think for myself."
3,"This book was understandable, yet very boring.","At first I though this book was good, but as it progressed it became more & more unclear and left too many unanswered questions. The end was a really big let down and I was really disappointed. I expected more. It held my attention for a while, then it just became monotonous and a chore to read (and rather ridiculous). The plot could have been a lot more stable and more thought out and the characters could have been a lot more developed."
3,Lady and the Tiger who??,"I think this book gives you a sense of anxiety that you can barely deal with. Margret Atwood paints a picture of the future that I think is possible and maybe even probable considering our society. The perspective in this book is one that I have never experienced before. In the books that I normally read there has always been a name for the main character, but not this time. Reminds me of those ""choose your own adventure"" books of the 80's. So if you don't need closure I recomend this book. Its for you"
4,Scary to think about.,This book was very thought provoking. How could we live in a world like that with all we know now? A book well worth reading. One of the best books I've read in a while.
4,Interesting tale,"I liked this book, and it was the first Margaret Atwood book I had ever read. This is a kind of dystopia that I wish had been explored a little more, so we could get a clearer idea of how the changes came about, especially with the names like Offred. The government in here is horrifying, they even encourage a sort of illiteracy by using pictures instead of words, and sterile women have basically no value. I would have also loved to see a more detailed ending, but you can't always get what you want, I guess. It's still a good book."
4,Chilling.,"Narrator had a resigned tone. I kept reminding myself that this ridiculously misogynistic society is reality for many women living in other countries. I never quite found myself in love with Offred, but that's all right; she was supposed to have been stripped of what made her unique in the past life. I kept wishing she would say more about her daughter, but the book was staying true to the numbing effect of her training. Speed-read the last chapter, and the end was completely open. Liked that. All in all, left me a little cold, but I won't forget it."
4,Good product and fast shipping,"This is very good product and shipping is very fast, Thank you. I will absolutely order more and Thank you so much"
1,I'm a fool,"This impulse buy turned out to be the worst music purchase of my entire life. On the plus side, the album cover is funny enough to pull pranks with."
1,Don't Bother,"Very disappointed in this product. Did not like tone in which it was written and did not appreciate some of the insinuations. Was looking for a factual run-down summary of each of the books of the Bible to use in conjunction with Bible study, but this couldn't do the job. Go with The MacArthur Bible Commentary (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785250662/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00) instead--a much better choice."
3,Cables Unlimited = good; HDE = bad,"I have a Cables Unlimited version of this product for personal use and that has worked great for me.For my workplace, I ordered this product expecting to get the Cables Unlimited version, but was shipped an HDE cable. The workmanship was terrible.There was a metal prong sticking out of the A/C power supply. Needless to say, I did not plug it in. The parts felt very cheap. The connection between the cable and the power supply was not sturdy.I returned it within 10 minutes of taking it out of the box.Is there a way to order this product, but make sure it's the Cables Unlimited version?3 stars is average rating. 5 stars for Cables unlimited, 1 star for HDE"
1,Do not buy,"Do not buy this product. It is so cheaply made that just putting it together it broke. The power adapter did not work, the power cables would not go together. You get what you pay for. Get the more expencive one. Dont waste your time with this."
1,Item not what is pictured - False Advertising,Be Warned: The item I received is not what is pictured. My item was sold by HottestDealEver Corp and it is a cheap adapter with no activity lights. The connections are low quality and my first test is not working. This appears to be false advertising. I have seen generic items like this for under $5 online including on Amazon.
4,GOOD BUY!,"Comfortable, holds you just fine. The 32 is a little tighter than others, but works very well.A good buy, seems durable and sturdy."
3,The final adventures of Conan,"Chronologically this IS the last adventures of Conan. He's an old man now, and after this adventure he doesn't return to his homeland; prefering to let his son Conn rule Aquilonia.A decent read, and better than most crappy Conan-novels not written by Robert E. Howard, though still lacking that certain pulp feeling."
5,It's a brush,"What can you really say about a brush? Well, it's ergonomics are excellent for one. Most brushes with a single connection point for the handle are very flimsy. This brush is not flimsy at all. The handle/frame are very sturdy. There are multiple layers/kinds of bristles that handle any type of mess. It's a great brush. Get it. Make your cleaning a tad less miserable."
5,Perfection.,"My Bloody Valentine has always been one band I really didn't know what to think about. Whenever I listen to them, I can't really depict if I should feel so stupid for listening to this odd arrangement of noises or break down and weep for each beautiful and perfect note that is played. When I bought this album, a couple weeks after I bought Loveless, I knew exactly how I should feel about this band. This CD has been in my player for a few days now and shows no sign of returning to its case. This album is like listening to bursting nebulas made into song. I never really thought something this perfect, this beautiful could actually be written, recorded, and produced. Each layer of guitar or vocals seems to fit so well, like putting together a 10,000 piece jigsaw puzzle for every track. I'm going to try to find every scrap of music ever recorded by MBV now as fast as I can, because something this good can't wait another second."
2,Night of the Living Dead Lite,"An intriguing premise--Romero's NOTLD and ""The Crazies"" combined with black magic--yields little of major interest. Characters are two-dimensional cutouts from B-Movie cloth, and, despite the previous reviewer's comments, tend to stick to assigned hero/villain roles in the narrative. Plot rules appear to change at a whim, with some psychotic characters conveniently able to ""hold it together"" when plot momentum requires them to do so. Furthermore, some possibly interesting themes, such as heroism versus safety, and anonymity versus altruism are never developed.Like old horror films, this ends in cliche fashion. The heroes and heroines embrace after the rather weak climax, while suffering no consequences--psychological or otherwise, for the actions taken in order to survive.For a simple, fun read, one could certainly do worse, but this was somewhat of a disappointing introduction to the author."
4,Very Cool book!!,"This is definately true Laymon style!! It totally keeps you on the edge of your seat. A great read for any fan of Mr Laymon indeed. There is plenty of gore, lots of suspense and some black rain to make it interesting...."
3,Take it for what it is.,"Laymon so obviously wrote this book very quickly. Why else would he leave so many plot holes(some people are ok in it) and such a silly and sudden ending? What I like about it is that it's a quick and easy read. No multi-layered plot lines and deep characters, just fast and violent gore. If you want to read about some people acting like maniacs and doing acts that would make Lucifer smile, read on."
3,Ok product,"I purchased this item to clean up the kitty litter that my cat would track out of the box. I thought it would be okay since another reviewer said they use it for that, but I don't think the brissles are really stiff enough to do the trick."
2,not comfortable at the waist,"Despite having ""no waistband"" these hose are not comfortable at the waste. Instead, the fabric just rolls down so that you have, in effect, a lumpy waist band. Also they do NOT stay up."
4,Surreality At Its Best,"F.P. Dorchak has managed to write the book I've been looking for all my life. Sleepwalkers delves deep into the inner workings of seemingly forgotten past experiences, those experiences which haunt our current incarnation with persistent shouts. Listen, learn, and awaken. Sleepwalkers helped me remember my dreams and understand their meanings better... and opened the door to possibilities only imagined. There is a reason for everything and everyone. Close your eyes, open your mind. Sleepwalkers will show you the way."
4,Solid oyster knife,Made quick work of my oysters and left my flesh intact. Very comfortable handle even when covered with oyster grime.
2,OK - but there are better choices out there,"If I needed an oyster knife ASAP, I think I could make do with this one if it were all I could get on short notice or one was made available to me. This is a bent-tip ""New Haven"" style oyster knife. It's not all that great for the most common technique of hinge-popping (inserting into the slot at the back of the hinge and breaking it open). The polished steel is pretty soft and bent on me the first time I tried using it; the bent tip has now been more or less flattened. It also showed very visible scratches the first time I used it. Similar style/sized knives include the Dexter-Russell S121 (bent) and S126 (straight) as well as the Forschner [Swiss Army Brands] 44693 (bent) or 44692 (straight). I've got the last one myself, and it barely scratches (very hard to tell against the brushed steel) and hasn't bent, unlike the Oxo knife. Dexter-Russell oyster knives are ubiquitous in oyster bars around the US."
4,liked the CDE,It didn't have the exact song I wanted. I would have given it less stars but it is a good CD.
5,A truly excellent album,"Definetely his best album to date, he gives the audience his endearing perception of the eighties. The production is superb and the harmonies are great and the lyrics are expertly crafted. The second best album of the eighties to U2's The Joshua Tree."
2,Too Flimsy,"I understand the need for a spatula to be thin and flexible, but this one is too flexible. It's as if someone cut the spatula out of an old coke can. It can hardly lift anything at all, and I find it just stays in the drawer unused."
4,"1st in the series is good, but as they go, they get great!","In the spirit of Janet Evanovich, the ""Strip"" series by Nancy Batholomew is laugh out loud fun. Not unlike Evanovich's Plum series, Nancy's writing improves with each book in the series and I was addicted after #2. The heroine Sierra Lavotini is a ""real woman"" not some overdone dream woman, women of any age can relate to Sierra. If you want a book that you don't have to think too much about, that simply allows you to escape through humor, this is a great series of books. ****"
1,Anti-Masonic Book,"Beware! This is an anti-Masonic book and should not be looked upon as a book to provide actual facts concerning Freemasonry. This book is recommended only if one wishes to see the nonsense the anti-Masons are saying about Freemasonry.For more balanced and factual aoounts of the nature of Freemasonry, read: 'Is it True what they Say about Freemasonry?' by Arturo de Hoyos & S. Brent Morris, 'Masonic Questions and Answers' by Paul M. Bessel & 'A Pilgrim's Path: Freemasonry and the Religious Right' by John J. Robinson."
3,Chimes,The 1 note chime works well enough but I have found the chimes with three bars work much better. You are able to get closer to the tone needed for relaxation.
2,Watch out if you have a dog,"Compact, well-designed, and well made chime with a sweet, high tone provided that the chime is struck very gently. However, if struck with anything more than the lightest touch, the chime sends my dog running for cover into the other room--must really hurt her ears. To solve the problem I bought a Tibetan singing bowl with a mid-range tone instead."
1,Not very pleased with the sound of this chime.... stay away,This chime ring is really brassy and tinny.... it actually makes many of the children say ouch and hold their ears....I would try another..
2,book is outdated and old,This book is old and outdated it needs to be redone and updated and the pictures do not make senesce
3,Was this trip necessary?,"How many times have you said to yourself, ""I'd really like to hear some of the most overplayed songs from the glorious years of 1970s FM pop music sung by a jazz singer who's trying for a wider audience of boomers who don't listen to jazz?""Me neither.Miss Allyson is an outstanding singer and has moments of success squeezing a little life out of these chestnuts. She tries to redeem the dreadful ""Feel Like Makin' Love,"" but, alas, this is a hopeless task. She is unable to find new space within ""All I Want"" and we a left with a merely capable cover. ""I've Got Eyes"" sorta works but mostly because of the guitar work.The musicianship here is excellent. It's a shame to hear it wasted on strangely respectful covers of just-OK songs from a decade that was truly a low point in American popular song."
5,Didn't come apart,"I went to a big chain store that sold several varieties of look-alike strainers. I tested them all by pushing down firmly on the mesh, approximating the amount of pressure I would use if I was trying to get the last juices out of meats and veggies from a homemade stock. The OXO was the only one that held together. On every other strainer, the screen came off the rim.I've been using this strainer regularly for a year. I am quite impressed by it. It is still in perfect shape. There is no rust nor discoloration. The wire mesh is still perfectly intact, smooth and round (unlike other strainers I've owned that are riddled with dimples). The handle has not bent one bit. The mesh has also been fine enough for all of my needs, without having to also use a cheesecloth as I did with other strainers."
4,Nice strainer,"This strainer looks nice and has a solid feel. I expect it to last a very long time. If you're looking for an ordinary hand-held strainer, this is a fine choice. Perhaps it would be nice if the handle were lighter so that the mesh could sit on a pot without having to be held in place; you'll need a separate strainer to do that. But for most purposes, this is excellent."
3,Arrived Partially Discharged,"The title explains it all. Good product, I can only guess, because (1) a lot of it was in the box instead of in the extinguisher and, (2) thankfully, we haven't had a need for what was left."
1,Can not return,"When I received this item, it had discharged in the box. Amazon customer service told me I could not return it, because it was a hazardous material. So, I am out $25.I bought a replacement in a store, and when I got it home, the dial said empty. At least I was able to return that one. Before I selected a replacement, I opened the box. I opened about 5 boxes and all were empty or almost empty.Still haven't gotten one."
1,arrived half way on it's way to empty,My negative experience sadly reflects the other low reviews.You are MUCH better off going to a hardware store and buying one there. Do NOT order on-line. There are too many factors you cannot control buying it on-line and Amazon doesn't let you return fire extinguishers. Mine arrived intact but already half way on the way to empty. The one I bought 5 years ago was completely full and lasted me 5 years. This one I hope lasts me at least 2.
5,Good product,Bought this to carry in my Jeep. Price was right for a multi purpose fire extinguisher Fits perfectly in the roll bar holder.
3,Half satisfying!,"Good news first. First time release of Nothing But The Truth and Thanks For The Memories (not to be confused with Big Broadcast Of 1938 which features the song Thanks For The Memories). Next we have great news. The first release of The Cat And The Canary, one of Hope's finest films. Now the bad news. 3 (count em, 3) films in this set that have been previously released. Even the bonus features have been previously released! Save your money. Wait until this set goes below $20 or The Cat And The Canary gets a seperate release (whichever comes first)."
4,Anything with an oud should not be booed....,"When I just started listening to jazz, I saw this cd at a local record store. It was the first on the rack and I thought, ""this is as good of a place to start as any"". Now, listening to jazz regularly, I bless my beginner's luck that I found this gem. Abdul-Malik, one-time bassist for Thelonius Monk, blends jazz with eastern sounds playing both upright bass and oud on Jazz Sahara. Strongly rooted in jazz, this album is free from modern day world music cheese. Johnny Griffin plays tenor sax."
4,Need a part 5 Bionicle,"I liked the 4th movie less than the first 3. Because it has new characters, none of the old ones and new story. It is good and enjoyable to see, but right from the start I felt it would be different from it's predecessors. The story is less dark and it is unfinished. There should be another part of the adventure, otherwise it is incomplete. But good so far."
2,No para comenzar con Roberto Bolaño,"Con un par de búsquedas en internet pueden saber de que trata el libro... Esta es la cuarta novela de Roberto Bolaño que leo (realmente es una novela?):1 - Nocturno de Chile +++2 - Detectives Salvajes ++++3 - 2666 ++++4 - Amuleto ++Para aquellos que quieren comenzar con Bolaño les recomiendo Detectives Salvajes, si les gustó lo suficiente entonces pueden pasar a leer 2666. Ahora que he leído Amuleto creo que fui benevolente con las estrellas a Nocturno de Chile, quizás ese libro merece 1 estrella por lo incómodo de leer y Amuleto llega a dos simplemente porque al menos se deja leer. El final ""suena bien"" pero tomando la frase de un comentario de una reseña en inglés ""mi alma no poética no entendió el punto por completo..."" (my unpoetic soul misses the point entirely...)"
2,Holes too big!,"The product is very ""gripable"" and would earn 5 stars if the width of the 'pliers' were not that darn big. As they are, it's unlikely you'll be able to use that for more than 2 out of every 3 filberts..."
3,"could've been better, but more than worth a rental","people have different reasons for liking or hating this movie, and i fall right in the middle for different reasons. the real dubya was hilarious at the microphone trying to stumble to the next sentence, and you see a bit of that in the film, but about half of it covers his younger years.it was actually eye opening at times, which made up for the lack of laughs for the most part. its hard to believe some parts were actually dramatic, anything dubya is normally a laugh riot, but there is deffinitely drama, from election losses to Bush Jr's ex girlfriend getting an abortion.all in all, its an unflinching, interesting look through dubya's life, with all the scandals and idiocy in tact."
3,Innacurate,"Some say this film is sympathetic towards my Hero, but I don't think it is. What i'm really mad at is that Stone FAILED to include the capture of Saddam Hussein!! Come on!! Remember when Saddam was capture and the Stock Markets Bolted to the HIGHEST they've ever been. the Economy was so healthy when Saddam was captured.Oh yeah, Stone also failed to mention Bushes support of Israel. Another benefit of Liberating Iraq...the safety of Israel."
1,Psychology Rather Than Politics,"I was quite disappointed in Oliver Stone's ""W.""He does a terrific job of portraying George W. Bush as a psychological basket-case.And this is fine. W. was and is a personality of feeble intellect and stunted, 7-year-old emotions.But that's all Stone does.He leaves it at that.Imagine if a movie were made about Hitler or Stalin and only covered their psychological problems. No doubt they had them. But the only reason people would care is the enormity of their crimes.Same here.SOME time should have been devoted to W's idiotic, murderous, neglectful, help-the-rich and kick-the-poor policies.On the other hand, Thandie Newton is terrific as Condoleeza Rice; and Richard Dreyfus is superb as Cheney."
1,Boring Another Stone Distortion of Histroy,"Stone, ever the friend of Hugo Chavez, manages to make a boring movie about the first American President who virtually by his will alone manages to free millions of Iraqi's from a tyrant and his homocidal sons. Providing a chance for rule by the people (not okay with Stone or Chavez - unless the ""people"" are really socialist rulers) may be the most pernicious assault on the oppressive regimes of the arabic world. If freedom takes root, ""W"" may yet be born out by history. Meanwhile Oliver's boring little movie, which I struggled to get through, will go down as one of his least history rewriting films. Even Brolin's acting is weak. But no matter -- we await with breathless anticipation Stone's coming and glowing movies on ""Chavez!"" and ""Che!"" and ""Ahmindinajad!"" Count on them to get great reviews from the N.Y. Slimes -- errr N.Y. Times."
3,A good movie.,"Not as good as Stone's ""Nixon"" but still a good movie. I wish it would have been made after he left office though so we could have seen more about his second term."
1,Waste of my time,"The movie was a clear attempt to make Bush look like a complete fool. Did Stone really need to show him in the bathroom wiping???? Is Bush always eating? When he eats is he always talking? Is the Bush family really that dysfunctional and hateful to each other? I know its just one mans ""story"" of another mans life, but it almost seemed like it could have been done by Michael Moore as it was so one sided."
4,Excelent,"Saw this last night. Oliver Stone in W. focuses on G.W. Bush's alcohol fueled youth, and the Iraq war.Bush's presidency is too recent to seek historical perspective. Stone is smart to not try. He gives the film a satirical flavor--deliniates Bush as a hard-drinking, ""from the gut"" Texas cowboy, with Dick Chaney pulling the reigns. You can argue merits, but Bush in W. is likable if not bright. Fun to watch.The history is also given quasi-comic treatment: watching Stone poke fun and not preach on the politics of the 2000s enhances W."
4,A WELCOME REUNION,"If there was a chance the Everly's were going to get back together after almost a decade and make a record, this certainly was the one they should've made and did. It's a solid effort with great songs, fine musicianship (without being over bearing) and of course, stellar vocals from Don and Phil. It's been said Dylan wrote LAY, LADY, LAY with the thought that the Everly Brothers should record it. Because of Phil and Don's acrimonious relationship, it took almost 15 years for that to happen. But here it is along with a McCartney contribution; ON THE WINGS OF A NIGHTINGALE and other assorted gems. My one knock and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is Dave Edmunds' production is a little heavy handed at times(it was the 80's afterall). With such pristine harmonies as those of the brothers Everly, who needs it?"
1,DON'T BUY IT!!! TWO THUMBS DOWN ON THIS ONE!!!,"Okay, somebody owed somebody a BIG favor in order to get this movie made!!! This movie is beyond ""terrible"". The mother was self-centered; her son was a brat & needed a haircut. He kept wandering away from his mother, exploring on his own (not a good thing for young kids to watch). And Patrick Muldoon (such a cutie in ""A Boyfriend For Christmas) was totally unwatchable. What is a Christmas movie without snow? There was none anywhere. Acting was very bad. The producers owe me a star; as this movie doesn't deserve even one."
5,MASH IT,"TRYING TO MASH TOMATO,POTATOES AND BEANS ARE HARD WITH A SPOON NOW THAT WE HAVE THE POTATO MASHER JUST MOVING RIGHT ALONG. LOVE IT"
4,Pretty good,"Yep, it mashes potatoes. Yep, it's much better than the useless curved style that I used to have. Yep, I'm glad I bought it."
1,Broke Already!,It did not even last one month before the side bar came lose from the mash grate. Shame!All the hassels of return... I rather be robbed by the product.
3,No so great.,I got this for my wife because she always complained about mashing potatoes. This thing didn't do a very good job. She ends up continuing to mash the potatoes by hand. We both hate lumpy mashed potatoes.
2,"Ill informed politcal mess, but the music is ok","I'm a big country fan, but it really gets to me when artists 'pontificate' their left OR right leaning political views. Stick to the music guys, and leave the politics to those who are more informed. It's funny how they grab on to the stereotypes perpetuated by the liberal left and just regurgitate it without fact checking at all. Reagan was probably one of our greatest presidents ever, and the left really, really hate that.The songs aren't bad, but I prefer ""the seer"" or ""the crossing"". Check out those instead of this release. Unless you happen to BE a leftist and want to listen to something that further validates your views."
1,DO NOT BUY THE REMASTERED CD!!,"This album has many of Big Country's best songs from the 1980's, e.g., ""Steeltown"" (worth the cost of the album alone), ""Flame of the West,"" ""Comeback to Me."" It's been out of print and inaccessible for years. And even now, very few of the songs are available as MP3's or on compilation albums. So I was *thrilled* two days ago when I saw that amazon was selling the cd at an affordable price.Then I got the CD and played it. Words cannot express my disappointment. The sound quality is abysmal, there's weird background noises, and worst of all, the vocal tracks are so buried in the mix that you can barely hear them. I am having *serious* trouble believing that this a legitimate release, and not some 5th generation bootleg copy churned out in somebody's garage.My advice: spend the extra money to get an used ""unremastered"" copy somewhere. For myself, I am hoping that amazon will accept a return."
3,muddy master,"This is a wonderful album, but a quick comparison of the single version of ""Wonderland"" on the fine remaster of ""The Crossing"" (remastered by Universal in 2001) to the same song on this pressing of ""Steeltown"" should satisfy anyone that something is amiss here. This muddy sound on this pressing of ""Steeltown"" results not from Lillywhite's production but from something awful that must have happened to this mastering. I realize that Big Country fans don't constitute a powerful bloc, but it sure is a shame to have such a flawed product out there representing this once-great album. We need some dedicated engineer to figure out what happened over there in Germany and undo it."
3,ok,It is rather small and has a limited amount of recipes. Many I wont ever use. Probably will use recipes from an internet search more
5,Great for College Students,With two children in college there isn't a lot of money hanging around for gourmet food. This book has been very useful to them as they try to stretch their food dollars.
1,late package,I would really like to see if this is a good book. I bought this item as a gift on September 6th however it is now September 24th and it has not yet been shipped. How long does it take to put one book in a box and mail it?! According to my account it is scheduled to be shipped on 9/27-10/01. I am very disappointed and will never order from this vendor again.
3,It's Ok,"Thought this would be fun for our family since we eat a lot of tortillas. Unfortunately there really aren't a lot of recipes in the book that I'd be crazy about making. There are some other great recipes though. Therefore this book is just ""ok""."
4,Handy little thing,Handy bottle opener that blends in with your other keys and doesn't take up a lot of space on your key ring. It also ensures you will always get your bottle opener back (at least if you want to drive home). It takes a bit of practice to use and requires you to have a few keys to give you the leverage you need to open up one at the end of a long day.
3,Brewskey?,"What can I say, if you are looking for a bottle opener that is in the shape of a key, this is the product for you. Also works to start cars."
3,"It's OK, but understand the limitations","Does an OK job opening bottles, but is hard on your fingers (because it's so thin) and if you're not careful will slip off and cut the inside of your finger on the bottle cap. On the plus side, it is cool looking, low profile, and doesn't bulk up your keychain. I'd buy it again, but understand the limitations."
2,"If you want to open bottles, get something else","Yes, it is possible to open a bottle with this, and it has a slick appearance. However, as others have mentioned, even positive reviewers, the design is not optimal, and it almost always takes a minimum of 2 prying efforts to remove a cap. This item is highly over-rated. Go with a wider style or the church key style opener if you plan to use it with any frequency."
1,Mind corrupting Religious Indoctrination,"-RE: (Book) ""Sound Health, Sound Wealth"" By Luanne Oakes-Ms. Oakes says: ""As we increasinglymaster our perceptions, beliefs, and thought/feeling patterns, wemagnetically attract that which we most desire."" -- Luanne Oakes=========================================I say: Zombie-robots are incapable of ""mastering"" themselves!Or, ""Perceptions, beliefs, and thought/feeling patterns"".I say: All 'that' is 'reserved' for the 'rational' few among us.=========================================""Luanne Oakes"" system, and style of expressing many of her mindcontrolling assertions and MAZE-like deflections from 'rational-reality',remind me of ""Deepak Chupra's"" writing; serving a similar purpose namely,to mandate 'blind faith' in a farce as the absolute only way to besuccessful at anything!-"
2,Short and blousy,"I bought this item from Amazon at a good price, but when it arrived it was short and blousy...too wide, yet too short. It's a shame because the materials are typical Columbia excellence."
1,knockoff,"I have a columbia vest from a few years ago, and this one is a FRAUD...paper thin, DO NOT get suckered into buying these cheap imitations!!!!!"
5,"great fit, excellent value","very nice vest. light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days. the run a little big, I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side...in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down..."
3,"Thinnest fleece I've come across, otherwise good","I like the cut of the vest and the cattail color is pretty well represented on my monitor - maybe more of a rich brown than the rich maroon-brown I saw, by a slight margin. There's some reddishness. As many others noted it's a thin fleece, so it might not be the best value for the $30 I paid in my size. Whether that thinness becomes a longevity issue or not I'll have to see."
4,Warm and soft. Not for skinny people.,"I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing. It's comfortable, soft, and keeps me warm. I also like the blue color. Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies. I'm 6'1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there's a lot of extra fabric in the middle."
4,Disappointing......not re-mastered,"I purchased this item with the expectation of a re-mastered recording. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Of all the Popol Vuh albums, this is, by far, the most poorly-recorded and could have used re-mastering.Having said that, this remains my favorite Popol Vuh release. The guitars ring, the songs all find a nice groove and the tunes are good-to-great.Additionally, the bonus tracks are wonderful! But here's the thing: the bonus tracks, presumably recorded at around the same time, all SOUND better than the original eight tunes on the disc. They are also mastered at a higher volume, so be careful if you have your sound system cranked up.This was my first purchase of the reissued Popol Vuh CD's. Now I'm not sure about picking up the rest of 'em. If they don't sound any better than the discs I already own, there's simply no point in doing so."
4,Entertaining,"This little book was not only helpful, but entertaining- I bought three different books that were all useful in their own right, but this one seemed to insult one's intelligence a little less, and if it did, it was deliberate and funny. A GREAT gift for a bridesmaid who may or may not know a little about being a bridesmaid. The trouble I had with other books was that they were a little mundane in the details of one's duties. This one laughed at them all."
5,GREAT GIFT,"Loved it!! Very concise and entertaining. I loved their comments on who gets the best man, and how to get him."
5,LOTS Of Fun!,"This isn't your usual horror/gore fest. It is campy, fun and sometimes cheesy. I think anyone who enjoyed Kolchak should appreciate this!! Give it a whirl!!"
1,Not for me,I bought this as a way to avoid freezer burn on my ice cubes..didn't work out very well for me. Still had freezer burn getting in and sliding the top on and off when filled with water was difficult and messy.I bought the tupperware covered trays at the same time as I bought these and I love them.
2,Not a Fan,"I agree with another reviewer - I'm disappointed that this product came from OXO Good Grips. This tray is not suited to easy, mess-free ice cube making. The cubes are small to start with, and then with the amount of spilling that comes from having to push so hard to close the lid, you barely have any water left. I think I'll give mine to a new mom friend of mine - it seems like freezing baby food is the perfect use for these."
2,what a mess...,This is a disappointing Oxo product - and I'm a fan. Filling these results in water slopping all over the place - I have to dry the kichen floor after each attempt to put these in the freezer. Throwing it out.It's also very space inefficient - tray takes up all the room of regular tray but produces only 50% as much ice.
3,Oxo Good Grips Ice Cube Tray,Good idea. Not the easiest ice tray to empty. Do like the idea of the cover. Not sure that the price is justified for this product.
4,works but don't overfill,These trays are very neat & work as designed for ice. We got them for baby food & found out quickly not to overfill them or the lid is nearly impossible to get off. I like that you can pop out just the number of ice cubes you need.
2,Frustrating!,"How hard is it to find a decent ice tray? Well keep looking, because this is not it.It does make ice (woohoo) but the cubes are very shallow, and the lid is hard to get on and off."
3,Clean cubes...tricky tray,"I expected this product to be a little weightier - the plastic isn't as heavy-duty as I would have liked. I suppose it's so you can twist the ice out, but the result is that the plastic appears a little warped, and the tray still isn't so flexible that the cubes just pop right out. I wanted it because I loved the idea of keeping freezer debris and ""freezer flavor"" out of my ice, but the lid isn't smooth on the track. When you fill the tray and try to slide the lid closed, it sticks, and so some of the water splashes out. I really didn't think twice about ordering it because I have always known my OXO products to be fabulous, but these are just o.k. As far as I have seen though, it's the only ice tray with a lid."
2,Disappointing,"No tray releases the ice more easily than these OXO trays, and the shape of the ice is different, but the lids are difficult to use. The trays don't fit in the ice tray compartment, and there is much wasted space in the handle ends. The lids are nice for stacking outside of the compartment, and especially helpful for freezing ingredients like broth and tomato paste- but those lids are difficult to put on.If you like large cubes and have limited freezer space, I suggest you look at other brands."
3,So-So,"There are a slew of beginner how-to fly fishing manuals out there. This one was recommended recently by a local outfitter store as""The"" guide. Not so much. While there were some worthwhile tidbits, there were a a few too many ""No Kidding, There I Was..."" fish tales and some heavy-handed environmental lessons (acknowledged as such by the author). The book was scant on breaking down the nomenclature and utility of specific gear. The hatch/fly section was useful but far more attuned to the etymology than the lure strategy. Yeah, this may be out of print, but I'd be leery of those selling it as the Anglers' Bible."
2,not as advertised,"When i recieved this the first thing i noticed was that it is not pink at all like it is advertised. It is actually very orange. Also, the clasp on the front to hold it shut was broken and so is one of the hinges on the back, so the lid is about to fall off. I think it had to do with the giant box it was packaged in and it was rolling around in there. The concept and the package is very cute, except for these somewhat important errors."
2,didnt enjoy,"I was not impressed with this authors ideas. the author was pretentious, hypocritical and seemed like an elitist. Would not recommend this to anyone."
5,worth the effort,"This book isn't on any best seller this and still if you want to learn how to concentrate, this is it. I've had the book for a little over 2 yrs and have only finished half of the exercises. When you think you've performed exercises adequately you haven't, go back and do it again. This book will test your will power but what you gain is worth the work you put in to it"
5,A TREAT!!,Give me Reba's Mercury output any day. I'll take it over her MCA travesties (except for her early MCA releases). This one is a dandy!!!
1,I love good grips but not this item,"I have almost all of the good grips accesories and I think they are great. But not this basting brush. Everytime I use it the bristles come out and I end up picking hairs off my food. I am so afraid to use it when I have guests because I don't want them to think I am losing my hair in their dinner. I threw mine away. Good Grips, invent a better basting brush and I will still buy it! :)"
4,"Practical, Insightful","Mr. Floyd recently spoke on Janet Parshall's radio show, giving practical advice for the Christian who desires to mature, yet without the misconception that it's going to happen overnight, which is one underlying theme of LIFE ON FIRE. Growth is in the little things, the little decisions. They make all the difference. Ronnie Floyd is senior pastor of a First Baptist Church in Arkansas. A good book from which you'll benefit."
3,Rumble in Hong Kong,"I give it three stars instead of two because I am a Jackie fan. I applaude the message the movie is trying to make, how the business industry intices kids into drugs and sex. That is it's redeaming quality. Jackie makes a pretty good bad guy. There are no really bad scenes. It's just lame. Go for Rumble in the Bronx, it's great."
1,It's Jackie Chan but not as we know him......,If only you could award a film a zero or negative star rating this would be one of them!
1,Rubbish Movie,"This is probably the worst Jackie Chan Movie I have ever seen. Come to think of it, Jackie Chan is not the star, it is some chinese woman, which is why the original title was Police Woman. It was very hard to understand what was going on, probably because of the poor picture quality and poor dubbing. I warn you, do not watch this movie, it will bore you, and could damage your health."
3,Why continuous?,"Great song, amazing artist. My gripe is; why is did is it a continuous mix? I personally consider myself a collector of music and think that continuous mixes have made it near impossible to find the true original mixes. I usually buy singles because they are almost always just the tracks themselves, this exception was a severe disappointment. Paul van Dyk is still the most talented trance artist in the biz right now, but I would suggest getting either 45 RPM, or some of his other works first."
1,"HALFWAY THROUGH, I'M ASLEEP...UNTIL....","until the strange voice of a woman pops in. I thought that this piece's music was rather bland, and the singing ruined it, but I know for sure that ANOTHER WAY, by Paul Van Dyk, is much better than this."
2,Well Arranged but Overproduced,"This is a novel concept for opera lovers and fans. There are some original songs and also some classic arias and ensembles with a modern update. Most of the pieces have been ""enhanced"" with additional voices (e.g. an aria sung as a two-soprano piece, with three male voices as backup).Unfortunately, this album has so much echo and reverb that it is almost impossible to hear the artists' actual voices. If you just like opera music, this is a wonderful album, but if you are a student of the operatic voice, look elsewhere."
1,Artists are great...CD sucks!,I will never purchase another CD that is copy protected! If I cannot use it on my iPod then I have no use for it. These record companies have become so greedy that they deserve to lose money. I have never stolen a song ever and I am rewarded with garbage from a paranoid corporation.
4,Worldclass Band,"A very good collection of the worldsongs makes this album a must have.The tenor and bariton voices of the men completed with the female sopranos are a joy and miracle to listen.Particully ""Nella Fantasia"" and ""The Prayer"" are top, even when you are familiar with the versions of ""Il Divo"", ""Josh Groban"" and ""Andrea Bocelli""."
1,Doesn't work,"Purchased the Freezer July 25,2010. First use was not successful. The motor is defective. I am extremely disappointed in the freezer.Please e-mail me as how to resolve this problem."
2,bad motor after a few years,"I received this as a wedding gift a few years ago. I use 2 to 3 times per year on average. After 2 years the latch mechanism came off the bucket, so I had to fix it. Last year the motor seized up, so I hit it and it started working. I had to do that every time last year. Also, it seemed to have less turning power. The first time I tried it this year, it didn't work at all. I took the top of the motor off and the spindle spun freely. I took the gearbox apart and greased everything up. It still doesn't work. I guess I'll have to buy a new ice cream freezer. This time it won't be a White Mountain. It's overpriced for the durability. I think I'll buy an ice cream freezer with a compressor, so I don't have to mess with the ice and salt."
5,Best Churn you can buy!,"The best ice cream churn on the market that is not commercial type. I make a lot of ice cream, last weekend I made 9 gallons with 2 White Mountian churns. I really put my 2 churns to the test. I have 2 older churns, not White Mountian, and I will only use them in emergency. Thanks for a great product and great service. W. Nance, Cary,NC."
2,Disappointed,We were very disappointed in this product. The White Mountain name no longer guarantees a high quality American product. The latch apparatus was very cheaply constructed; the motor would not even latch onto the bucket. We were disappointed that White Mountain uses cheap Chinese labor but continues to sell at a very high price.
5,So easy!,We have made several different ice creams and they each come out tasting wonderful. Just like the old fasioned way. You do have to cover the entire canister with ice and tons of salt. We learned that really fast. Highly recommend and def. worth it's value. The motor is a fast one!
5,Peachy Ice Cream,"Peach Ice cream has been a family favorite for countless years going back to the generation before us and the ""Hand Crank Freezer"". We have had a number of freezers but they never matched the quality of the White Mountain freezer. Churches will sometimes stage a homemade ice cream night, and I have observed the ladies that are serving their favorite ice cream, while still in their freezer. The ladies that owned a White Mountain freezers always bragged about its superior operation and long life quality.So, I bought one! It's clearly worthy of all their bragging, and I am morethan satisfied."
2,Metal Contaminated Ice Cream,"Yes, it makes ice cream but you can't eat it.Inside the container where the mixture is poured, there is a beater which stirs it as it freezes. The sides of this beater are thin wooden slats connected onto the cast metal beater by a few, cheap metal screws. These screws get wiggled back and forth while the container spins around in the ice. When it finished I was scooping out the ice cream and I found black streaks in it. You had to look closely but they were there. I don't like the idea of aluminum.This was a very cheap and not well thought out way of connecting the wood to the metal. Poor workmanship. Not recommended."
2,Feel decieved,"I researched for a new ice cream maker for months. I read reviews on all the major ones. I finally decided on this one after reading all the great reviews here. Machine worked great the first two times. Then it started not freezing the ice cream completely. By the fifth use, it was not freezing at all and the motor was making a weird noise. The last time we used it (March, 2011) it would not work at all. I contacted customer service. They told me to send them a copy of the receipt showing that it had been purchased within a 12 month period. I wrote them back stating that it says on the side of the bucket that it had a 5 year warranty. I received another email today telling me that the bucket and the container have a 5 year warranty and that the motor only contains a 1 year warranty. Had I known this, I would have just purchased a cheap one from Wal-Mart and replaced it every year."
1,Disapointed and Hungry for Ice Cream,"Since we bought our 69206 electric freezer three years ago, it has made noises like it was on it's last leg. Finally, it quit working this past weekend."
1,BUYER BEWARE,PACKAGED WELL. DID NOT USE FOR APPROX. ONE MONTH AFTER ARRIVAL. ELECTRIC MOTOR SOUNDS TERRIBLE. SECOND TIME THE MOTOR SEIZED. APPEARS AS THOUGH THIS UNIT MAY HAVE BEEN RETURNED MERCHANDISE. BUYER BEWARE.
3,White Mountain Ice Cream Freezer,"Not sure why I keep buying these, other than we love to get family over and churn ice cream. I replace the motor every year. The White Mountain makes good firm ice cream, but the motors do not hold up. I think the recent motor replacement will be my last. I'll just buy my ice cream from the store."
1,Died on the 3rd use,"Took it to a family reunion seven hours away from our home. The grandchildren wanted homemade ice cream. This was the third time I used it. Sparks flew from the motor. It made a horrible noise and died. The children were very disappointed, and I am still mad. It is an expensive piece of junk! Do not buy."
5,White Mountain Ice Cream Freezer,"I followed directions exactly (although my husband usually doesn't!) and had outstanding success. Great ice cream, frozen quickly and ever firmer than the directions sounded like it would be.Rival F69206-X 6-Quart Electric White Mountain Ice Cream Freezer"
4,Old Fashioned ice cream,This is an excellent icream freezer. I live in the desert so I am concerned about the bucket drying out. Folloe the directions that tell you to put a few inches in the bucket a few hours before using and it is fine. It freezes very fast and does'nt require as much salt as the directions call for. The vanilla and chocolate recipes are great but the peach was a little lacking. White Mountain still makes the best icream freezer and is a quality buy.
1,Motor loud and quit working,"Just after my warranty expired, the motor quit working. I was thinking that spending this much for an ice cream freezer would mean it would last a long time. Not so! Everything is in good condition except the motor. Very dissatisfied"
5,The best electric ice cream freezer/maker.,"After comparing other ice cream freezer/makers, this is the best bang for your buck. You will be glad you paid the extra money. Most other brands are to small and do not have the powerful electric motor. After two or three servings of ice cream (with a smaller quart ice cream maker) your back at it again. If you're single, that might best fit your needs, but if your serving a family or guests you better go with the ""big dog"". And this ice cream maker will stand up to the test. With the 6-Quart White Mountian Ice Cream Freezer, you can make as much or as little as you want. Set up is quick and easy and the instruction booklet is very straight forward and simple to follow. Follow the instruction booklet and within 20-30 min. you'll have a great textured, blended batch of ice cream. This is a great product and would recommend it to anyone who is a novice or experienced ice cream maker. It is well worth the investment."
1,Jere' Longmans books,Dont read anything by this clown. ANyone that would attack a young womanb in the manner he did does not deserve attention much less money
4,"Good book, but sad","I liked how this book gave the reader a glimpse into the lives of each of the passengers and crew on board Flight 93. I felt that this book gave just enough information for readers to know what kind of person each individual was, but not so much that it would seem like an invasion of privacy. It makes me sad that so many talented, caring individuals had to lose their lives the way they did."
5,Great book to make you think about your life,"When I first saw this book, I was hoping for a book that told what happened on flight 93 and the emotions of the people and family. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this book had all and more I was looking for. It takes the reader through a detailed account of every person on flight 93, what kind of person they were, and how they spent thier last minutes. This truly is a motivational book and makes you step back and realize how precious our own lives are. It made me appreciate more the people I see and love every day of my life. It helps you to never take for granted your life."
2,Dead mother back to life?,Come on CBS! Bringing back Steve's dead mother back to life is just unrealistic and unbelievable! You better fix te storyline this season or you're gonna lose me as a viewer!
1,"Insufferably pompous, wrong-headed drivel","That this book is considered important is an indictment of the law school community. Labored writing, weak analysis, all combined with a fatuous tone."
1,Do not buy this unit it is junk,If there were zero stars available this unit should be assigned to this unit. Changing the battery is way to difficult. It could be dangerous and there are no on line instructions. Even with instructions it still is to difficult and dangerous for the average person to even change the battery. Unless you want to spend a lot of sleepless nights don't buy this unit.
3,A fix for low battery chirping,"I contacted Kidde support and spoke w/a CSR who told informed me of the following procedure to silence the annoying chirp after a battery replacement.After you replace the battery, press and hold the test button for 5 sec. (don't push hush). The alarm will silence automatically after a few beeping cycles. Now the chirp should be gone.Apparently pressing and holding the test button forces the alarm to check and reset the internal low battery circuitry."
2,Poor Product Support,Moved into our home a year ago and it had the Kidde 1275 alarms - no manuals left for us. Have had no problem with it chirping (even in the kitchen) but when I went to change the battery learned I would have to disconnect the AC wiring tab to access the battery compartment. The AC wiring has locking tabs that prying with a screewdriver will not release - and no instructions on how to disconnect are on the unit. The manufacturer should provide online documentation considering this a is a safety device. I am concerned that I will break the tab/wiring harness and have to wire in a new unit. I am handy enough to replace it but if people are to service these regularly there should be better support. Given todays internet capabilities I no longer think there is a reason for a manufacturer not to have online documentation. 2 stars for poor support.
3,FALSE ALARM PROBLEM,"We have the 1275 in our new house, which has 3 levels. When the alarms were about 4 yrs old, one of them went off at about 3 AM, causing all of them go go off.We were in Lviv, Ukraine, on vacation (daytime for us), and got a frantic call from our house sitters (2 adults, 3 children)wanting to know how to fix the problem - it was 3 AM for them. This was the 3rd time they had had a problem with the alarms. I told them to disconnect the units.When I returned home, KIDDE told me it was bugs or dirt causing the problem. I followed their instructions and used compressed air to clean all of them out - what a pain. But, we haven't had any false alarms for a year, now. But, I do expect them to start up again when they get dirty!"
1,Worst thing EVER...,"Same problem as everyone else, only happens at night, totally random. There is a special level of hell reserved for whoever designed this...As I lay in bed woken up for the 5th time by the third seperate unit, all I could do was try and think of a way to find the engineer of this smoke alarm and spend the rest of my days making sure he/she never gets any sleep. Ever. Again.I think in the first gulf way they used the Kidee practice to psychologically harrass the Iraqis-making bombing runs every 1-3 hours. Obviously someone from Kidde thought it was soothing, though, and designed to design a smoke detecter that would do the same thingI am SOOOO annoyed."
1,Still chirps with new battery,"Have many of these in my house, 8 yrs old, and am on my 2nd detector in 2 months to start chirping and battery replacement will NOT fix the problem. Replaced the last one but now looking at these reviews I'm replacing ALL detectors in the home!!"
1,I absolutely hate this stupid thing.,"This is one of those hardwired alarms that you have to shut off the circuit breaker before you can safely change the batteries. On top of that though, the battery compartment is UNDER the AC connector, and the AC connector is a stubborn little bastard that does not want to pull loose. What a pain in the tuckus. If I ever have the opportunity to install my own smoke detector it won't be one of these."
3,finally got it,The book was in good condition just like the ad said. My problem is that it took way too long to get it. When I contacted the company that shipped it all they could do was give me the tracking number and I had to investigate where it was. Great customer service would have had the company track it and report to me. Next time I need to order from online I will think twice if it is for a present due to time sensitivity.SincerelyKathy Atchison
3,"Warm voice, slow delivery - a pleasant listen","While Bev Kelly was not a major talent, I feel that her voice and her talent have been unfairly characterized in the review by ""A music fan."" Just listening to the recorded samples will clearly demonstrate that.Her voice does not have a weak, whispery quality - it is a soft warm voice, and while her singing delivery is slow, it certainly isn't anything like ""spoken."" I'm not familiar with her career, but from this recording I would assume that she must have had a decent career in small clubs. If you are a fan of female vocalists you will probably enjoy her."
2,Dare to Bare-Erotic Shaving,"The DVD has much to offer with regards to nudity and lovemaking scenes. However, if you are looking to learn exactly ""how-to-shave"" the pubic area, keep looking. There is very little ""training"" on the fine art of how to shave in this DVD."
5,Finally found Carmen,"I read this beautiful story years ago and had long lost the old copy I had. I had looked in used books stores from time to time but with no luck. I finally looked on Amazon and there it was! I paid little for it and received a precious old volume with yellowed pages. There were bookmarks left that were old advertisements for Nina Ricci perfume and when I loaned the book to a friend, she framed one for me as a Christmas gift. This was truly a special purchase."
4,The Far Horizon,"We purchased this movie because it was based on the book ""Sacajawea of the Shoshones"" written by my grandmother Della Gould Emmons.The company did a good job digitizing the original Movie and it is wonderful to have a copy on DVD for our children and grandchildren.Thanks so much for offering this movie again."
2,Typical Hollywood nonsense,"Apparently, the screenwriters thought an expedition that resulted in no battle casualties and no real fights with the indians was not sufficiently dramatic. So they larded the story up with romantic nonsense between Clark and Sacajawea (and a non-existent love triangle among Lewis, Clark and Julia ""Judith"" Hancock). For good measure, they threw in two pitched battles with indians. None of this ever took place.I think the story of the Lewis and Clark expedition is exciting enough to be told accurately. Someone should develop a new movie of the Lewis and Clark expedition, one that tells the story straight."
2,Tired of being robbed,"My son and I are fans of the series. We have the newer DBZ series (seasons 1 thru 5), DBZ and DBZ GT. I am getting tired of paying more and getting less. Why are their discs with 3 episodes on them? As fans, I expect each disc series to finish the saga. This is utter BS and I'm tired of it. The producers of this series need to stop taking their fans for granted.Signed,Season 5 may be the last DBZ product I buy."
3,The Bug Man .,"There are no stories in Dragon Ball Z , only excuses to get into a fight , and the main excuse for this season is the Bug Man , Cell , a bug genetically engineered from the cells of the good and evil fighter of the past , and guess what ? He wants to fight .The same , appreciated , fold-in box set of six CD's and a booklet , with the first and second CD's containing six episode each , the third five and the rest three episodes .Why am I still buying it ? The fights , the price and I liked themanga .We need Dragon Ball Kai ."
4,Lacking the complete cell saga...,"If you are looking to see the entire cell saga, this dvd does not include it. The Season 5 box set is shorter than most other releases, only 600 as compaired to 700 with the last releases. I was exited for this season because I assume that it would the end of the cell games. Gohan's ascention to SSJ 2 is my favorite part of the series and I am disappointed I have to wait another 4-5 months to wait for anothe dvd release. That is the reason this is getting a 4 star and not a 5 star."
1,"oh no, another anti-government book","If you are a homeschooler with a deep distrust of your government, then this book is for you. I am a homeschooling mom. I do not deeply distrust my government. The basic premise of this book may have slight credibility, (yes, Stalin did kill more people than Hitler). Yet, ""Uncle Eric"" makes some pretty over-the-top claims. Claims such as, ""The Jewish Holocaust gets the publicity because it is regarded as the justification for Jews to have a Jewish state (Israel) in the Mideast."",(pg 36), and in regards to Pearl Harbor, ""Few are willing to face the possiblity that the President and his cronies planned it all."" (pg. 162).If you are looking for facts and the whys and wherefores of WWII, look elsewhere--it'll save you having to pay to ship this book back."
5,Bless Susan Tassone,This is the best and well organized book on the Rosary for the Holy Souls. The added prayers at the end of the book are a plus.
5,Large head,"The head, as mentioned, is much larger than the ones i have had in the past- not complaining though, this thing does its j-o-b!"
3,Get Book with CD instead,"I bought the Toques Flamencos book at a store not realizing at the time it is also available in a set with CD for only $5 more. Then found the only way to get the CD (which the book recommends and refers to) was to buy the set, meaning purchasing the book twice. I agree it's a good beginner/intermediate book presenting an introduction to the varied flamenco styles, but the pieces are not really performance caliber outside of a student recital setting. Paco Pena does state in the introduction that was his intention, but if you're like me you don't like putting a lot of time and effort learning music you can't use professionally. A flamenco audience would expect a bit more embellishment(ie. flash, speed, elaborate runs, etc.), than is given in these arrangments."
3,Fan is okay,"The fan rocks both and forth once turned onto higher settings making it unstable, load, and obnoxious, it does however move the air well, but at the risk of it looking like its going to explode."
5,Powerful fan!,"I've had this great little fan since 2000 and it still works great! I don't know if it's still in production, but it was an excellent value!"
4,Good power and not too quiet.,"This fan is doing an excellent job of pulling in the cooler morning air into my house down here in hot Florida.It has much more power than the similarly priced and smaller fans that I have.Also, the adverising makes the claim that it's whisper quiet; Fortunately, that's not accurate. There is a strong smooth white noise that drowns out most of the extraneous and annoying noise in the house and outside.Honeywell used to make fans with this much power that were smaller and could be tilted and that costs around $15.00. Those were 5 star fans. The Lasko 3733 is a solid 4 star fan."
1,it is already broken,This fan won't stay standing up. I will need to buy another one soon. I have it leaning against a wall right now...which prevents some air flow. I would not recommend this product.
1,its cheeap,this fan is not a good made fan at all its a peace of crape its cheep plastic knob and handel i thar this out and got 2 lasko 3720 and thay are much better than this 3733 cheeap thing
2,"Bad packaging, loud, and smells","Mine arrived crushed because there's no package padding (should be double boxed). I fixed it myself because I didn't want to return it, by bending it back into shape (it's sort of flimsy, so it wasn't hard). But, it's too loud for the bedroom even on low. And, it smells of an oil/electrical smell when it is turned on, yuck. I have it turned on outside to try to work out the smell (no, it's not rubbing or smoking or anything).I'm trying to replace a Holmes box fan that burnt out after years of use. The Holmes was extremely quiet on low, and had the added benefit of a rotatable angled vent that could blow diagonally from the window into the room at the side. Sadly I can't find a direct replacement for my old fan, and this one isn't going to fit the bill."
2,broken on arivel,"it was broken, from no packing materiel.found the same fan for $11 cheaper local & no shipping."
2,Eh,"This fan was... sort of acceptable? I'm a student in New York and I lived on the sixth floor of a pre-war dorm building, where it got so hot that sitting in the room was unbearable without a fan. I bought this fan to help cool down, but it honestly did little to nothing to cool my little shoebox of a room. I suppose I can't blame a $20 fan for being weak, but I will say that after only about a month of use (two weeks in the beginning of September, and two weeks in May), one of the blades just fell off. I have no idea what happened, it just dropped off as if someone had sliced it off with a knife. I unscrewed the whole casing and managed to reattach the blade with crazy glue and copious amounts of tape, but I have to say it's a pretty shoddy fan if you have to McGyver it after only a few weeks of use. I'll give it two stars because perhaps the blade thing was a fluke. All in all, it doesn't cool very effectively and it broke very quickly; perhaps invest in something a little bit more durable."
4,Clean & Slippery,"Good lube as far as lubes go. Cleans up well, no odor and safe with toys and/or condoms. Flip top tub does add convince to the product."
2,expensive,"Overpriced tube that you can get cheaper at other locations. Works very well of course, Also the product image does not match the products physical appearance."
4,Great product but a bit large,"This is yet another addition to oxo's new steel line where the handle is steel with a rubber edge and fins. It works well and is quality made as all other oxo products, the only thing i find is that the head seems to be a bit oversived in proportion to the handle and spatula arm. But still, overall i am pleased and do reccommend it."
5,Label maker,This is a must have item for everybody that has CD's and DVD's laying around with no lable. Very easy to use. Create your label then print it out. The label goes on perfect every time! Hey! No MORE drawers full of blank DC's! I love it! Well worth the money!! Would be a great gift!
2,Really frustrating.,"I bought these labels and applicator because they were inexpensive. Well, I got what I paid for! I've found that the software that comes with it isn't super user friendly. I spent some time getting it to print just right and did some test prints on regular paper that looked great. When I was ready to print on the actual labels, something inevitably failed. There's a seam across the middle of the label sheet (in case you want to detach them?) and I think that always causes some weirdness with my printer. Overall I get about 1 in 3 to print correctly. I will be buying the more reliable, slightly more expensive labels next time."
4,Oh Yes,This is perfect for me. It has a bunch of labels to print on and a device that makes sure the label sticks to the center of the disk. There are inserts of different sizes and the whole thing is real easy to understand and use.
2,see-through labels,"My biggest issue with these labels is the fact that, even once printed, you can see the original printing on the DVD. Granted I could just find DVDs that have lighter or no printing, but I purchased labels to cover up the DVDs that I already had. But unfortunately everything printing on the DVD shows through.Other than that, the labels were fairly easy to use. I did not bother with the software but instead found a PDF template online to use. The label applicator definitely makes things easier, although the first time I tried it the label was off-center. It was easy to peel-off and re-adhere though."
5,Excellent choice for DVD labels,"This kit has everything you need to label your custom-made DVDs and their cases. It is very simple to use, including the software, and very inexpensive."
2,Prints way off the mark,After hours of screwing around there is now way to print these labels on center. Finally I had to cut 1/2 inch off the top of the label page to get it somewhat close. You have 2 choices buy this or buy a bullet and rent a gun...you'll need it.
5,I luv this CD! with Karoke,I love this CD the High School Musical did a good job for singing skills I love the CD and I do not get sick of it AWESOME CD! 10 stars
5,High School Musical,This was a Christmas gift and was very much appreciated and enjoyed by the young girl I gave it to. Thanks for such fast service.
5,Awesome!,"I loved this soundtrack... Vanessa Anne Hudgens and Zac Efron aren't very talented in my opinion. Lucas Grabeel (Ryan) was the best singer... he was great in ""We're All in this Together""...GREAT ALBUM!"
2,Not That Good!,"It was a good story line, but the leding lady was just weak. She just couldn't make up her mind, yes she was sick but why did she not want him there for her. I just disliked her alot. I was happy to put the book down."
3,I don't like the DVD side,"I like this album very much.but I hate the DVD side, the editing.Why do they use a ""fade to black editing"" when David is talking.Come on!!! I want to see David talking to the fans there, I only hear his voice and see a black screen, I HATE IT!!!!!I don't mind about the sound and the quality of the colour of the video.(it's not that good but it's not bad)I love the gig they did."
4,Classic Flordian DM,"This is Morbid Angel's rawest offering. The production is thick, but muddy, and the guitars are sometimes drowned out by the drums. This record is fastly executed and seems only as about half as long as it really is. This was the start of greater things to come."
2,overrated,"I've seen a lot of people hail this one as a classic death metal record. Maybe I just don't get it. It far from [stinks] but it just isn't that heavy.Here's my reasoning: The vocalist is weak for a death metal singer and there's some kind of echo effect on the voice. The guitar riffs are fast sure, but they just don't have really heavy hooks. The song writing is mediocre, nothing really catchy. The drums are fast but monotonous. In fact, the whole record just kind of fades into a montone blur - not very heavy at all.Bottomline - average disk. Nothing spectacular. Good death metal records I can recommend from the same time period are: Death - Leprosy, Entombed - Clandestine, Sepultura - Beneath the Remains, Pestilence - Consuming Impulse."
2,Useful in a limited way.,"Useful in some limited ways. Any soft addiction is best managed through the same proven methods that have helped many with ""hard"" and ""soft"" addictions for decades, mainly twelve-step programs and the philosophies associated with them. All Wright is talking about, in other words, is recovery, that is recovering your life from addictive habits and behavior. You'll get much more from reading books like Addictive Thinking and the Addictive Personality by Craig Nakken, et al or Healing Your Self Esteen: Recovery from Addictive Thinking by Bryan E. Robinson. This book is recovery light and watered-down. Don't give in to your buying addiction and save your money."
4,European buyers be warned,Beautiful movie and beautiful digi-book.The bluray with the movie is region free. But European buyers be warned that the dvd containing the documentary on Malcolm X is region A.
4,"Great Film, Wonderful Central Performance, and an Indictment of 60s American Society","This ls a lengthy piece of work, but well worth watching, not only for Denzel Washington's remarkable central performance, but for the points it makes about the African-American's status in American society. Malcolm X grows up in a violent world, and dies a victim of that world. In between he manages to preach a message of integrity and self-determination that it as important today as it was when he first delivered it way back in the late 50s and early 60s. Spike Lee's direction is controlled yet includes some remarkable moments - especially in the moments leading up to Malcolm's assassination, where it seems as if he had a premonition that something dire will to happen to him. Lee's camera focuses on Washington's face - apparently expressionless, yet full of mixed emotions. A tremendous effort to tell a story that must be both told and remembered as a significant moment in the history of the African-American."
4,Malcolm X,I wanted to learn more about the life of Malcolm X. The movie provided it. Nice overall movie with Denzel Washington playing the leading role.
4,Me myself and Malcolm,"This movie not bad but brothers jus cain't accept the fact Malcomlm not everythang he cracked up to be. This is proven partly because he probly even sell crack as the film point out. He be ailing and this movie prove the point to a tea. Spike Lee jus doing his job but this ceck out the facts of his life in the film and don't often match the book of the same name. Malcolm have a weakness for white women and the movie does at least make that clear from the get go. He neglect his own black woman because she tell him, ""Why, just because I don't [put out."" This is the way it truly go down by the book to. Movie Malcom not the real deal. So Spike, don't make this felllow a hero. This is your opinion or just to make some profit from the people? This movie miss the point most of the time but still enjoy."
4,Scathing depiction of Victorian values,"A slow, difficult read yet not without merit. At times scathing at others jocular yet always insightful.The tale is of one Ernest Pontifex and 4 generations of his family beginning with his great-grandfather told by a family friend, Overton.The reader is exposed to the hypocrisy of Victorian values inevitably consequential in the development of our protagonist and his overbearing bible thumping father.Butler describes the twisted growth of the Pontifex family tree; one limb overshadowing the next letting it shrivel in darkness. One wonders whether the tree was planted outside the Munster residence.At times I couldn't help but hate Ernest's father and reel in disbelief in Ernests' naivety. These conflicting emotions make the book enjoyable."
2,Much better novels out there,"Recommended as a classic, I found this book to be dry and uneventful as a book could be. I was only mildly captivated by the character of Ernest and the rest of his self-rightious family. This book is more of a psychology work than a novel."
4,what if you don't like your parents (and everyone else does),"An autobiographical novel about a Victorian boyhood and early manhood, The Way of All Flesh centers around the question of how to act when everyone loves your parents except you:""There are orphanages,"" he exclaimed to himself, ""for children who have lost their parents--oh! why, why, why, are there no harbours of refuge for grown men who have not yet lost them?"""
3,What a difference a century makes!,"This book just didn't stand up for me. The problem with social satires is that once the culture changes its hooks and barbs lose much of their rhetorical force. As accute as it must have been a hundred years ago, Butler's critique of 19th century English culture just isn't as relevant today as it was when it was first written, and so for me the book was a disappointment.Nonetheless, Butler's insights and (often) insults on the nature of the parent-child relationship make the book eminently readable, and occasionally quite illuminating. And the glimpse into the struggle that went into making a man during that time of industrualization was similarly fascinating. The juxtaposition of the economic realities which faced a young man then versus now was, for me, the most interesting aspect of the novel."
1,Better Than Bounty Huntrees,"I wasn't surprised to see that this movie was not as good as it looked. To top it off, Drew Berrymore starred in it and this was the most disappointing thing. I expected her to do better. She is such a beutiful and talented actress and to see her waste her time off this mess is a shame. But I do admit, it is much better than the first one, and I can't blame Drew Berrymore much because the story line sucks. I am so disappointed in the Bounty Huntress films and I am glad than I only spent a few dollars on them."
5,"Solid, does what its supposed to",After using many many junky can openers I spent the money on something worth it and i like it. Solidly put together and can also open my beer bottles!
4,Seems impressive so far; Made in China however.,"So far so good. The attention to detail seems good. It feels well made. If there was anyone thing that got my attention, it's that is was made in China. For the money they are charging for it, it seems like it could have been made in the US. Doesn't really matter I guess but the bottle opener on it doesn't seem to grab caps very well."
5,"best can opener ever, highly recommend","wife and I love this can opener. it really does work super good, shipping fast. seems durable. highly recommend. Better than an electric can opener."
4,"If you have problems with breaking can openers, just buy this one and save yourself the hassle",I've owned many can openers before this one and they all have seemed to break after minimal use. This one has already proven to be much more durable.
5,Outsanding!!!,"Originally the thought of spending 22$ on a can opener was ridiculous. However after the 2nd cheap can opener in two months stopped turning I was pretty mad. I was tired of spending 10-12$ on a can openers that didn't last, so I googled ""top rated can opener"" and I found this amazing piece of hardware. Right out of the box this thing amazed me. It's surprisingly heavy, and very well made. The large handles feel good in your hands and the action is very smooth and clean. I went into this purchase very skeptical and came out very happy. I have to say that I have been using this can opener for about two months now and I is by far the best I've ever seen."
5,"Sleek design, comfortable handle, affordable price","Excellent addition to my kitchen! I needed to replace the cheap can openers that I purchased after my Pampered Chef one broke. I love this can opener! The handles are large and provided a great gripping surface, the turn handle is large which makes it easy for anyone who may have problems with their hands or wrist (I have carpool tunnel in mine), and it opens cans in a flash. The only downside is that it can not be washed in the dishwasher - other than that - fantastic!"
5,Clearly the best can opener I have ever had...,"Wow !!! How I wish that I had come across this ""baby"" a long, long time ago. I would have saved plenty of money, time and annoyance with the other assorted can openers I had purchased over the years.This can opener is just the ""best ever"" and I mean that sincerely. This can opener works so smoothly, so precisely, so gently--it glides easily with no effort....I find that I must watch it operate to know that it is truly opening the can I am intending to open....because it is just ""that smooth"" when it opens your cans. I am so pleased and happy with this fantastic can opener....I tell everyone that will listen. This is a fantastic product and so worth the investment. I absolutely love this can opener...and I just bet that you will too."
3,Mostly does the job,"The Oxo can opener is easy to attach to the can, easy to turn, and does a good job of cutting the lid off of the can. But, the can opener always leaves a small portion of the lid attached to the can. It just is never able to cut this last bit of the lid. That requires the delicate act of trying to lift the lid out of the can without cutting your fingers. I will go with side-cutting can opener next time."
5,Best can opener,"We liked this can opener so much we were sad when we couldn't find it after a move. So, we ordered it again (maybe another seller the 2nd time). Then ordered it for the third time recently as a Christmas gift. I cannot locate the order history of all 3 purchases for this so I don't know where we went wrong but one of the times we ended up with a black handle version with a plastic knob. Both versions are good but I think the silver/black handle one is superior and that is the one we most recently received which we ordered from this listing."
5,Finally a can opener that works,Great product. Opens all cans with ease. Easy on the hands and works great.
5,smooth quality opener,"we have had a hell of a time with junky openers, we have tried to buy the best or highest priced unit every time only to find out its junk, I finally looked on-line and wanted to try this before we just broke down and bought a commercial unit. so far its been great and you can tell its better just by how it opens up. It was also at a great price, cheaper than some we have bought"
5,One of the best can openers,"I usually don't leave reviews but I was compelled to for this can opener. It's really hard for find a durable and easy to use can opener, but look no more. This item is it. Will normal use, this can opener can last for a long time. It just feels very durable with minimal energy to use. Heck people with severe arthritis maybe able to use this can opener with easy, probably easier that those electric can opener that are less durable and cumbersome."
2,Nothing like reality,I was a white girl on full scholarship for four years at a boarding school in CT in the late 70's early 80's and this book is absolutely NOTHING like what I experienced. The only things that even remotely rung true were the daily school meetings and the funny little traditions that these schools have. I bought the book because I thought it would bring back some great memories and I found I couldn't relate at all.
5,Not a Prep School Novel,"Disguised as an update of the classic Owen Johnson prep school novel, this book makes more sense as a story of endurance. It has an ending, but not a happy ending. The protagonist lives through the novel, but she isn't really in a psychological state to learn much from what happens to her. She has courage that earns our respect. Think of this as a Russian prison novel where, after many years, the prisoner is released."
2,"Well, I did make it through the whole book...","Well, I did manage to be interested enough to read the entire book, but when I was finished I wished that I would not have bothered. I was mad at the author, mad at the main character, mad at the people who gave this book good reviews, and mad in general. I wanted my 3 hours back. I'm over that anger now, but frustrated about stereotypes of the Midwest and the Northeast were prevalent in the book. I think that I would have rather read a fluffier book about a shallow, happy girl who learned something than this psuedo-philosophic girl. Save your time for something truly worth reading (like The Heart is a Lonely Hunter or The Secret Life of Bees.)"
2,hard to believe,"The ""Sugarman"" crush is the only theme that runs through the whole book, all others such as ""assassin"", ""teaching bike riding"", ""theft"", ""hair cutting"" etc. are not. If you think the ""hair cutting"" is far-fetched, the ""hooking up"" with sugarman toward the end is even more so. Why all of sudden, the boy decided to hook up with Lee in their last year? What has made her different in Sugarman's eyes after being classmates for three years? This part and the last chapter (after colleges) are so ""Hollywood"" and are the worse parts of the already flat plot."
4,Kudos to Sittenfeld,"Is the writing fabulous? Yes. Is the story very ordinary? Yes. However, what makes this book worth reading is the depth of Lee Fiora, as explained by Sittenfeld. There were times when I loved Lee and was rooting for her, but there are also parts of the novel were I was disgusted with her behavior. However, Lee Fiora is very human and thats what I like most about it. Sure, there are parts of the book that are for lack of a better word, bubblegum. The comparisons to Holden Caufield, I think are without merit, but overall its very enjoyable. The writing is quite impressive for a debut novel. I am very much looking forward to Sittenfeld's next work and am hoping the sophomore effort does not disappoint."
1,ANNOYING,"i can't believe i read this whole book. it started out promisingly enough, but soon devolved into navel-gazing blather. this is a writer who loves the sound of her own voice too much. she needs to concentrate on these little things we like to call character development and story. what a huge bore."
5,Mom of teenagers,My daughters brought me to hear a reading by Curtis Sittenfeld at our local bookstore. If anyone has an opportunity to hear her talk and read it is well worth the trip/ time. The book is well written although a bit disturbing at times. After reading the book I was glad my girls go to day school but they do share some of the same issues. I was pleased to have the chance to discuss the book with my girls.
3,Hmmmm,"Having gone to a prep school, I am both engaged by and repulsed by this book. The good parts are its accuracy. Yes, these people exist, and no, I have never encountered anyone like Lee.The bad part is the lack of growth of the character and her seemingly undeserved distance from her family. While Lee clearly yearns for a better life than what her fanily can offer, she is too deeply attached to material goods and status than the book explains.A definite let-down, but one I still finished and thought about."
5,Prep Has It&#65533;s Own Sense of Power,"Perhaps not as much of a 'what's lurking on the next page' as ""THE DA VINCI CODE"" and not as flowery as ""MIDDLESEX,"" but a finely written book that proves to be a true guilt pleasure treat. Like the seedily addictive ""MY FRACTURED LIFE,"" ""PREP"" shows off a journalist's attention to detail with the author's descriptions and a soft touch for the pains of coming of age like in ""LIFE OF PI."" Not the fiery race-on-the-edge of ""MY FRACTURED LIFE"" or ""VERNON GOD LITTLE,"" but a powerful ride worth taking."
2,Grinds to a halt,"This book started well, but after awhile it became a chore to finish. The main character of this book doesn't grow, and she has nothing interesting to say. She doesn't have as much money as most of her classmates, but it's hard to see where that really gets in her way. She has a miserable sexual relationship that just kind of goes on and on. So what. The book finally ends and I just didn't care.There were some good sections, such as the parents visiting day sequence when the main character was so (unjustifiably) embarrassed by her parents that her father decided to leave early. I also found the aborted relationship between the main character and the townie to be fairly interesting. Yeah, both of these sections were overdone, but there was a ring of truth to them. Most of the rest of the book was an attempt to make us feel sorry for a character that was totally unremarkable and unlikeable."
1,Prep: A Stereotype of Minorities,"Sittenfeld used EVERY racial stereotyped character she could create: the black girl who was caught stealing, then thrown out of school; the ""cool"" black guy whose only mentioned accomplishment is playing--you guessed it--basketball; the Asian girl who speaks broken English, and stentches up the dorm room with exotic Asian foods; the Latino girl who is pretty but not intimidating to the main character because the latino girl is not white? It's relentless, and highly offensive to those of us who know real prep schools where the ""minority"" students are not living stereotypes!"
3,Disappointing,"Yes, this is a well-written book. It is easy to get into, holds your attention, and the characters are all developed very well, especially Ms. Moray, Lee's 10th grade English teacher. This is a very fun book to read, and while you're reading it, you think it's pretty darn good. For that, the book gets 3 stars.The thing is, after the book has been read, you realize that it isn't so darn good. The narrarator is whiny. She is selfish. She has almost no redeeming qualities-- in fact, the only time I found myself rooting for her was near the end of the book, when she confronts her ""sort-of"" boyfriend.This book has been compared with ""Catcher in the Rye"" and Lee Fiora is supposedly a female Holden Caufield. True, she does have the angst and apathy, but she has no Phoebe; no one she truly cares about.So, should you read this book? Yeah, sure, but don't drop $14 on it. This is the kind of book to check out from a library."
2,A Painful Read,"While Sittenfeld is a commendable author whose writing is heartfelt and convincing, her protagonist Lee Fiora is so frustratingly pathetic and misguided that it is a difficult read. Fiora is a character that at first you sympathize with because she is an awkward outsider, but then you grow to hate Fiora because she learns nothing from her past experiences and continues to make that same mistakes over and over again. Her repeated gaffes make you cringe throughout the book, and at the end you are thankful to be rid of Fiora and her annoyingly analytical and aggravating ways."
5,Teenage Wasteland Exists Within the Ivory Tower World,"This book made me burn my dinner,and forget to let the dogs out before bed. Sittenfeld and her characters of Ault academy captivated me from beginning to end. As a former English teacher, this is the first book that I've read since Wally Lamb's, She's Come Undone that really captures what it's like to be young,akward,and adolescent.By providing her characters with identifiable flaws, Sittenfeld made it easy to connect with the ficticious students. Although the book takes place at a prestigious prep school and there are most definitly issues involving money and social class, Sittenfield remembered to include elements that most people can relate to on some level; sex,friendship,and peer interaction to name a few. If I was still in the classroom, I would bring this book to my students in a heartbeat. As an adult reader, I enthusiastically reccomend this book to anyone looking for a new take on a familar theme. Curtis Sittenfeld is one to watch."
3,"Interesting topic, boring book","I looked forward to reading Prep after the good reviews I read here. I was disappointed. I didn't feel connected to Lee at all, even after being in her head for four years of boarding school. She didn't seem real and I wasn't intrigued by her or her situations. The writing was good, I enjoyed reading Sittenfield's descriptions of the daily activities of the boarding school students, but found myself bored when it came to Lee's love-life and lack thereof. Maybe it's just been too long since I was in my teens and I couldn't appreciate her situation, I don't know."
2,"No, this is not the new ""Catcher in the Rye""","The review I originally saw for this book made that comparison, and based on that, I was delighted to get a copy. But what unfolded was so disappointing. It wasn't catty enough to really give a peek at life in a prep school, (or maybe I just went to a similar public HS socio/economically)? Lee Fiora is possibly the most annoying character I can recall spending time with. If I were dealing with her in person, I'd have pushed her out the door. How her relationships, particularly with the object of her devotion play out (no further details here in order not to spoil the book for others), seem highly improbable to me. Unlike another reviewer here who sited Mr. Fiora as most tolerable character, I'd have to give that accolade to Lee's roommate, Martha, for putting up with her for 3 years. It's a dilemma to me how this girl was ever accepted in this school. But I believe this author has promise, and hope she'll try again."
4,Any girl would be able to relate in some way or another,"While Im not going to say this is the most captuating, cant put the book down book ever read (in fact at times i found myself drifting off because of how slow the storyline was becoming) I definately enjoyed reading it. While I didn't go to boarding school, and was not so much as insecure as Lee, reading her story brought back so much of my own self back in high school. I, like all teenage females, had some self confidence issues, some which just went away as high school went on, some i had to really work on, some which remain to this day. While reading ""Prep"", I was really able to go back to my own high school experience, even remembering a lot of my own thoughts and observations, and it really felt good to realize how much I changed. So, if not so much entertaining, this book is definately therapeutic!"
2,Prep,"I was so disappointed by this book. I never really got a grasp of the main character and I kept waiting for a climax in the book - which never took place. It is good writing, but the story needed to spark."
1,UGGGGGGGGH!,This Book was horrible! I heard really great things about it and so i figured i should read it. The main character is really boring and shallow and i didn't like her at all. And for her to allow a boy to just take over her life even though she knows he doesn't love her is simply ridiculous! I don't know i thought that this book was kind of boring and i just didn't like it that much.
2,bad,"completely inaccurate portrayal of prep school. This simply propagates the inaccurate belief that because we have money and wear pink, we're bitches"
2,Something's Missing,"The story was so-so in spite of rich details. I cam away thinking I knew what a boarding school was like. Although I more or less enjoyed gaining that knowledge, I didn't really care about the book."
3,Okay,"I found myself consumed by this book and wanting to read it in any spare moment I had. And overall, I think it was good, but not great.I kept waiting for something big and meaningful to happen, but it was very episodic, which maybe was the point. It *is* about high school, after all. The main character's thoughts and feelings were painfully close to some of the feelings I had in high school, so I enjoyed it in the sense of knowing I wasn't alone in what I felt then. What was kind of depressing about it though was that it also made me realize that remnants of those feelings are still with me -- some of the character's thoughts and behaviors reminded me of some of my own recent thoughts and behaviors. I have come a long way since high school, but seeing my current self in a high school character is definitely a kick in the pants to ""get confident, stupid"", if you know what I mean."
3,Utterly plausible... and yet pointless.,"I wish I could say I felt more strongly about this book as I had awaited reading it with interest after seeing a brief write up about it in the New Yorker. Unfortunately, it left me a bit indifferent.It's not that the writing is bad-- it isn't. In fact, Sittenfeld has managed to perfectly capture the voice of a girl coming into womanhood while braving the difficult navigation of the boarding school caste system. Her characters were utterly believable and realistic.That being said... they seemed rather lifeless. I didn't get a great sense of growth or development or epiphany. I wanted so much more out of her protagonist which I never got. I could have saved myself the time and expense by calling up one of my friends and saying ""Hey, tell me about high school!""For my money, a more engaging and dynamic take on similar subject matter can be found in Colleen Curran's ""The Whores on the Hill."""
1,Don't get what all the hype is about,"I was very dissappointed with this book. Very slow going. While reading I kept thinking that this book would appeal to my 15 year old daughter. However, the graphic sex in the last chapter changed my mind about that. Not sure what type of reader she was looking to attract. The subject matter was too juevenile to keep my interest piqued. If she left out the last chapter this book would certainly be shelved in the Young Adult section. A real dissappointment."
4,I give it 4 Stars for a HighSchool Dramady,"Think Mean Girls (Minus lindsay lohan plus Kristen Stewart)This book gives a very vivid picture of an outcast perspective of a Prep High School outside the Boston Massachusetts area.The main character is not likeable to the reader nor to anyone she comes in contact with in the story, except her closest friend Martha.Unlike in mean girls, where the main character becomes popular and the meanest of the mean, our main character, Lee never becomes popular, throughout the story she stays at the lowerend of the social hierarchy makeup.This was a quick and enjoyable read for me. a good fluffer"
5,A Great New Writer!,"I was between books and since my wife had finished it, I decided to give it a go and I'm glad I did. This is the story of Lee Fiora, a prep school student at Ault School in MA, who writes about her four year experience there in the first person. Even though it's told through the female prospective,you will remember every single teen anxiety you ever felt growing up and be able to relate. Pick this up today. It's not just a great summer read, it's an all year read."
2,I tried to like this book... I REALLY did...,"Maybe I was too close to the story and setting of this book (I too was the outsider middle class girl who attended a rich girl school)... but I did not find anything likeable about the protagonist of this story, Lee Fiora, and at the end of the book I felt as if nothing had changed. Is it even possible to leave high school the exact way you enter?As the novel progressed and she moved through her high school years I kept waiting for her to grow up, come into her own, do SOMETHING besides mope through every day as an uninteresting, unenthused brat. I kept trying to relate to her on some level-- to have a reason to like her, have sympathy for her, ANYTHING! But it just never happened."
2,"Another prodigy, just what we need.","Well, I guess it's not enough that all of the young lions and lionesses out there have an exclusive (Yale, Princeton, Harvard, Bennington, Stanford, etc., etc.) pedigree that places them in a different social league than 89% of their fellow Americans; now these folks are going to start writing about these delimiting experiences as well. Wow, I guess it's a nice break from the novelized versions of ""Friends"" that keep popping up in front of me like bright pink bubble-gum bubbles whenever I open a magazine. And I guess since the average consumer deigns to sit through a book review only if it has (a) 150 words or less and (b) a letter grade at the end to abbreviate the conclusion reached in those tedious 150 words, we might as well have a book that's all about grades."
2,disappointing,"I did not care for this book and the only reason I kept reading was to see if it would get interesting; it never got interesting. I kept skipping paragraphs just to get to more interesting parts. I went to school in a small town in Mass, although it wasn't a prep school, it was as close to one as any public school can get. I was the type of person to do what I wanted just because no one else did; I didn't care what 'they' thought of me. I started hating Lee very early in this book because she was such a fake, phoney person. I kept thinking that Lee needed to stand up and be herself. There was no depth to any of the characters."
4,"Great stuff, just a little short","I cannot understand the reviewer who said that she was a prude and was rude to the audience. Maybe that person didn't realize she was joking. The audience certainly understood it. That's why they are laughing.OK. Off my soapbox.It's great to watch Natalie live. The expressiveness she has with her voice is accentuated by seeing her perform. She's a singer who can make you really feel the emotion of what she's communicating. My only complaint was mentioned by previous reviewers, and that is that it was short. In her defence though, some of the song choices were different than the CD. So together, you get a fuller idea of what the show is like."
1,Very Disappointing,"While I do enjoy Natalie Merchant's music, I was extremely disappointed with the concert on DVD. Video quality was marginal and the audio mixing was terrible. Some instruments are barely audible while others are grossly overpowering (as is her vocals in several occasions). The lack of traditional ""additional material"" on DVDs is also glaring. This one pales in comparison to any concert on DVD or VHS."
1,Test of time,"I am watching this movie again for the first time sine 1978. It has withstood the test of time- it is just as saccharin and stupid today as it was 34 years ago. Today there are many horrid movies released each year that suck less than this one, but they don't win Oscars. How bad movies must have been in 1978."
1,Verdict from 2002: Onesided and Hopelessly Outdated,"A lot has transpired since Richard Rovere died in 1979 that makes his book outdated and irrelevant: Venona and the disintergration of the Soviet Union, for example. Both have put paid to such questions as ""if there were Communists in the State Department."" Arthur Herman's book ""Reexamining the Life and Legacy of America's Most Hated Senator"" --using the revelations and documents from the former Soviet Union-- clarified these issues once and for all. McCarthy may have been an eccentric demogogue and an alcoholic (so what makes him different from many other politicians?) but history shows that he got it essentially right. Diehard communists, progressive communist sympathizers and all those misguided souls that believed and still believe that it was a ""noble"" cause-- will never forgive him for getting it right."
3,complete metric wrench set,typical flea market quality metric combination wrench set. only going to be used to work on discount department store bicycles. should be good enough for that.
2,Glad I read Triple Witch first,"...had I not, I probably wouldn't have continued with this series. Dead Cat Bounce just seemed to meander. The characters were flat and the plot was pretty dull. Sarah Graves definitely picks it up in her next book."
3,Its ok,"This isn't the best book ever, but its certainly not the worst. Unfortunately she skimps on the details of the main characters and overdoes the descriptions of inanimate objects and physical locations. I wish she would've explained the interplay between the characters in the beginning - it would make things a lot easier to understand. Overall I thought the plot was too slow and dull to read, so I never actually made it through the whole book. But I can easily see how it may appeal to some readers."
3,Comfortable but not moisture wicking,"A light material that's comfortable on sweaty skin and does not have irritating seams. Looks like it might snag if you get it caught on velcro so be careful with armbands and the like. I'll prob stock up on these for the gym and running. The short sleeved version is also comfortable and well cut.Update: After putting these tops through some serious outdoor running and spin classes, I noticed that the fabric eventually gets drenched and sticks to your body (basically like cotton). Since this is supposed to be performance material, I had to knock off stars for that"
5,fantasti tasting training treats,"My dogs love these. As the previous review said - 95% meat, no fillers, non-greasy. My dogs love the taste of this treat and come running when they see me pick up the bag."
1,This thing keeps breaking on me!,"I have had my Intuos2 now for 2 years. And as of today, it has ceased functioning twice. I had to send it back to Wacom the first time for this SAME problem: my tablet stops receiving a signal from my pen... the orange light blinks erratically to green and back when I drag the pen across the surface, rather than staying green. I'm getting tired of having a $300 drawing tool that I have to pay to ship back and get fixed simply from normal use each year."
2,it ok but...,It is slimmer then others but isn't very rugged. The waterproofing is not very good compared to other otterbox lines. If slightto light protection is all you need then it will work fine but if you drop it alot and lots of water get the bigger bulkier one that hold up to punishment.
2,Too long to wait for justice,"Civil rights activist Medgar Evers was assassinated in 1963. In this movie, directed by Meathead of All In The Family, justice is about to be served - finally. The guilty party is brought to trial by a competent attorney in front of a jury that is two thirds black. The ending of the movie is good, but it takes too long to get there. Most of the movie really isn't enjoyable."
4,An excellent movie dealing with Civil Rights issues.,"This is a movie that needs to be seen, much like ""Saving Private Ryan"" needed to be seen. It would open eyes to the harshness of the time and the idea that good can prevail."
5,"great large, but light-weight mixing bowl","I don't have any complaints about this product yet, but I've only been using it for the past couple months. It is great for mixing anything. I love the rubber bottom to keep it from sliding. Sometimes I mix things while I walk around the kitchen, or since I'm short, I often put it on my lap to get better leverage, so it's great that this bowl doesn't add much weight. It is great that this is made out of plastic to keep it light-weight and relatively shatter-resistant (vs. glass/ceramic)."
3,I used to love this bowl,"I received this bowl as a gift and I loved it. The non-slip feature is wonderful. I've had the bowl for a couple of years now and I do use it a lot. I did love this bowl.....until today. I baked a cake and made frosting in the bowl. While eating the cake, though, I kept finding tiny pieces of plastic in my mouth. I checked the bottom of the bowl and there are definitely deep scratches where the platic has begun to chip off. Wish I had noticed before I made the cake. Great bowl, just keep an eye on it for the day it will need to be replaced."
5,A well made bowl,"This is a nice, large bowl. It is very sturdy and solidly made. This isn't cheap plastic construction. I like the spout for ease of pouring and the rubber grip as well. I recommend it."
4,I wanna get sleazy ?,"In the Navy is great, I totally agree with Sean Kelly from Tamworth. I would join the Navy because of this song but I get sea sick all the time. The CD is missing a few classics like Sleazy and the excellent songs from the much derided ""new wave"" albumRenaissance. I have the LP version of that album and side two sounds like Devo or Eyes or Nasal Boys (Dieter Maier from Yello's punk band). People who dismiss the Village People are morons who have never gotten drunk at an office christmas party, humped the boss's leg and got sacked. Too bad for you, Joe and Josephine Square."
4,"Quality product, let's hope I don't need it.","Installation was easy, although the instructions aren't very clear on the mounting height.They instruct you to use the top holes on the hitch, but what if the hitch is of a different configuration or what if the top holes are already occupied?I would have liked to see an explanation of how far below the tray sits from the hitch surface, then I could confirm what holes to use.But otherwise, very happy with the construction and fit/finish - let's hope I never experience it in action."
2,These are 2 dollar sunglasses,"These are inexpensive sunglasses. I get it. They are cheap. I understand that they're not Ray Bans for $200. I get that. But dont ship them to me if they are scratched w/ white paint on black frames. Or have the filler holding the lens in place to be coming apart. Shoddy craftmanship. Poorly made. I expect them last (even with care) for something like 2 months, and the over-under on that isnt looking good for me.Whatever. I guess I get to look forward to buying newer, cheaper shades soon."
4,one more,I really love these shades. I've already bought two pair unfortunately due to the first pair breaking from being roughly handled in the front compartment of a jet ski and the other pair from my hungry dog. These are worth buying again and again.
3,Size matters,"My family has always loved these linketts, and the price here was much cheaper than buying at the store, my only complaint is that the length of the linketts is at Least an inch shorter than they used to be... Really, leave them long enough to fill a hot dog bun"
3,Mens Sport Stringer Tank Top.,The 2XL is a 1XL at best . . the style is not bad and the quality is okay2.I did order a second one after I got the first one.
3,"Action packed, fun movie (3.75 stars)","This movie has a lot of action and good character development. The villain and the hero are played well and there is plenty of suspense. I thoroughly enjoyed the characters, the action, and especially the unique fight scenes. This is an all around pretty darn good flick!"
1,Not very interesting,When I first saw this video on youtube [...] I thought that learning about Vedic mathematics would promote a further interest in geometry. This book is way too simple for anyone who has studied university enterance mathematics and even for people not literate in algebra there are much better books under speed mathematics such as the Trachtenberg system however this book is much more expensive and is aimed at university students.
5,Love this chair!,We are a military family and we travel frequently to visit friends and family. This chair is perfect for our fast-growing 6 month old daughter. She is able to sit upright with us at the table and in the yard with the big kids. It folds up super compact in an easy carry pouch and we can take it anywhere. Super easy to wipe clean too.
2,this product is a joke,"First of all, I thought it was going to be a great asset to have on the go for our daughter, but it proved to be rather ineffective for a toddler and for travel. The buckles don't adjust to where she can't maneuver out on her own. It's very short and she can't even sit at the table and enjoy a meal with us. Do not see a point to have this at all."
4,Good travel chair.,"This chari is VERY convenient for carrying around. It fold and is light weight. Also, it ties securely to every seat we have used. The down side is that the seat is made of cloth, so the baby sinks in a little and it is not always the most condusive seating position for eating. Putting a towel under our daughter has helped prop her up."
3,Should have waited 'till FULL MOON and AFRODISIAC.,"I hate when artists release a video hits compilation after one or two albums (IE: Janet's ""Rythm Nation Compilation""). Brandy has released so many good videos (especially ""What About Us"" and ""Full Moon"" most noteworthy) since 1999's ""Never Say Never."" There could have been bonus special features like clips from MTV's ""Making The Video"", interviews, etc. 3 stars because the videos from her self-titled debut and the phenominal ""Never Say Never"" are great, but if you want the best buy...wait till she hopefully releases a COMPLETE collection of videos (with special features)"
3,"Good, not great","This scooper is good in that it makes a nice-sized, round scoop of ice cream; however, the lever is useless. Best results come from rinsing the scooper in warm water before use, but that is true of any plain scoop without a lever as well.Overall, this was fine, because it was so cheap, but don't expect that little lever to do anything."
2,"Good Handle, So-So Scoop",I love the handle as it gives you something to really apply some pressure to when the ice cream is hard. The bad news is that the scoop part doesn't eject the ice cream very well. I usually end up using another spoon to get it out of the scoop. The ejector just doesn't move far enough to be effective. I'm not used to being disappointed from an Oxo product.
5,They got it right,"The other reviewers weren't kidding.This is (what I see) a typical OXO kitchen tool. Heavy duty, good looking, and no groaning or bending when you attack really hard ice cream. Add to that a handle large enough to put some serious carving power behind, and it comes up a winner."
1,Lever does NOT routinely eject the ice cream,"If ever I was tempted to believe (which is surely true!) that companies hire people to post rave reviews, this is probably my best example for suspicion. I mean, people buy this scoop because of the handy-looking ejection lever--so if it doesn't work, why the rave reviews? You've just got to question the one(s) that essentially sound like perfect commercial copy.As another reviewer also said, the ice cream does NOT routinely eject using the cute little ejection lever. You still have to use a spoon to scrape out the scoop of ice cream that won't eject. I had 7 dinner guests last night (the day I bought this scoop), and I needed a scoop of ice cream on 7 dessert dishes. Only twice did the ice cream fall free of the scoop by using the lever. The other 5 times, I had to use a spoon to help it along."
2,Easy to read,"Like Williams' Theodosian work, this book is an easy read that more or less sums up what previous scholarship without new analysis. It's a good introduction to the period but not on par with biographies of other emperors such as Constantine and Julian."
3,Where has the Paddy we know and love gone? I think I know...,"I agree with other fans (they have to be fans in order to seek this hard to find work out - especially in the U.S.) that this is at the very least a step sideways, if not backwards, for Mr. McAloon and the Sprouts. But there is hope - I believe the spirit of our friend has been channeled by none other than - SCRITTI POLITTI! I am not even sure if I a spelling that right, but this band (which is really German expatriate Green Gartside) is sounding eerily like I imagined Prefab Sprout would on his newest album White Bread Black Beer. There are moments I swear I hear Paddy's vocals affectionately addressing American culture with wit and flair.I highly recommend this album to anyone who misses the best of Prefab, and who is equally frustrated by their most recent output"
5,A facinating DVD. Highly recommended.,"I just saw this DVD recently and my copy was fine. I didn't notice the sound being out of synch with the picture. Maybe the early batches were faulty.I find the picture and sound quality very acceptable. In addition to the performance a full length documentary is generously included (i.e. snippets of him giving a master class to young students) on Arrau's career and his return to Chile for the performance his trademark piece.The videography is dyamic. There are various shots and angles of the Arrau as well as the orchestra and conductor.Not a slick Deutsche Grammophon style production, but certainly more honest and interesting."
4,Go.Video is Fantastic!,"I recently purchased the Go-Video DDV9556 Dual Deck VCR for home use. I was looking for the ability to quickly and easily splice scenes from one video to another without additional expensive editing equipment. This unit does it all and with great ease. I am very impressed! The ""sync"" editing (on the fly) works great, as does the 8 scene automatic editing. With the on-screen titler, you can even label scenes. It is very easy to switch between decks for viewing. You can even watch video from one deck while recording TV on the other. The controls are very intuitive on both the console as well as the remote. I can't say enough about how pleased I am with this unit. The only complaint I have is that there are only RCA OUT (audio/video) jacks on the rear of the unit (in addition to coax (cable) in/out) - the RCA IN jacks are located only on the front of the unit. Aside from this one engineering deficiency (the only reason for 4 instead of 5 star rating), the unit is sensational!"
4,Good for beginners and medium experienced brewers alike,Did't realize the edition that I bought was older but read it anyway (seems to be from the early days of homebrewing). Some information is dated but a great reference for extract brewers and some medium to advanced information as well. Can't wait to get home to try some of the techniques described in the book.
5,The best Damn Homebrewing book ever.,"The title speaks for itself.I have been brewing beer, making wine and beer for over 20 years. I still pull this book out as a referance, on a regular basis. Don't brew without this book.Dave"
1,utencil useless,"I've always found the ""Pie Server"" utensil useless, especially if you don't have room for kitchen cabinets to store all the utensils. You can get by just by using a fork and a regular butter knife or a turner, a flipper or spatula.That is what I tend to use. You do have a higher Pie drop ratio with a fork and a butter knife or spatula but it won't matter unless you're in a social setting where a ""Pie Server"" utensil is deemed absolutely necessary. And then, you'll probably be eating caviar with snob Pie anyways. Sometimes I even use my dirty hand or just use a dirty spoon to eat Pie out of the tin.Now, I just use the Oxo SteeL Pie Server as a Masonry trowel for spreading mortar on bricks or concrete blocks with a technique called ""buttering"". It isn't ""heavy duty"" but for touch up jobs, it's acceptable."
5,Perfect!,"I love this pie server! It's dishwasher safe, solid and sturdy. The handle fits comfortably in your hand, and the serrated edges neatly and easily slices through with one try. I honestly don't have any complaints about it. For the price, it's totally worth it."
4,Excellent starting place,"I found the style and content to be very easy to follow. Maximum learning with minimal effort. The subject matter was largely based in a traveler's mode, but essentials such as sentence structure and pronunciation are stressed. The lessons are easy to assimilate and retain. I highly recommend this course, and hope to find the next sequence soon."
5,Non-stick features are the best!,"The non-stick bottom and handle to this bowl make mixing so much easier. On my countertop, and water makes the bowl slip. But the gripping bottom on this bowl resists slipping, making mixing easier.Unlike some other bowls, this one also has a non-stick handle. Frankly, my hands get wet more often than my countertop, so the non-stick handle may turn out to be more helpful than the base.The 2 quart size is just about perfect for mixing simple sauces or marinades.Remember, this bowl is just about unbreakable too!You will love this bowl."
4,the 4th crusade's twin,"i love bolt thrower. when you hear them for the first time, they might sound like a boring, run-of-the-mill death band, but at further inspection you'll find that they sound like no one but bolt thrower. it might seem boring, because these days death metal has become much more ferocious and brutal than it was 11 years ago when bolt was in their prime. their style is disciplined, sustained, and full bodied. the solos are a little insane, but the motion of the songs are forceful and deliberate. ""warmaster"" is not as raw as ""realm of chaos"" but it is second only to their masterpiece ""the 4th crusade"" which warmaster emulates on a song to song basis. and i see nothing wrong with that... stay true to your roots and your fans will love you for it. this is great, early 90's death metal. i recommend buying warmaster first, just so you will be in complete awe when you buy the 4th crusade and hear it's beauty."
4,A must have for any old thrash/speed/death metal collection,CD includes one additional track not originally on the cassette release. Good to see this is available on CD. Would have ranked as 5 stars if it was a re-mastered release. This would be a highly recommended purchase if you liked Napalm Death - Diatribes/Fear Emptiness Dispair.
4,Wow - what a Splendor,"What an amazing movie... It brought all the fustrations of two people who are in love and can't be together back to me. I was hoping through the whole movie that there would be a happy ending for Bud and Deanie, but to my surprise it was a different type of happiness. Two star-crossed lovers who couldn't be. Warren Beatty and Natalie Wood were wonderful and I can't wait to watch more movies by them. They sure did make much better movies before I was born. I would recommend this movie to any friends of mine."
5,Splendor of a splendid movie,"An excellent love story that should be watched by anyone who appreciates great movies. Natalie Wood shines as the beautiful Deanie Loomis. She is a great actress and this is one of her best movies in my opinion, of all time."
2,The remote is too sensitive,"Great idea - but the remote is way to sensitive. I try to be very careful with it, but if you ever put it in your pocket you are likely to fire at the wrong time. That is not fair to the dog and will ruin any positive impact I hope to gain from this as a training device.The buttons should be inset, have a cover, or require holding for a couple seconds before firing to prevent this issue."
1,Forget Paris,"I wanted the DVD ""Forget Paris"" and I was send a DVD with that film and 3 others. I just wanted that one DVD and its album cover,etc. Not a collection of 4 DVDs!"
4,ENCHANTING........,"A PINT SIZED BASKETBALL REFEREE,A DEAD BODY AND THE EIFFEL TOWER.WHAT DO YOU GET?YOU GET A QUIRKY CUTE LOVE STORY STARRING BILLY CRYSTAL AND DEBRA WINGER.THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE FILMS TO WATCH OVER AND OVER.THE WAY THE STORY IS LAID OUT IS ORIGINAL,AND WITH ALL THE ANTICS THAT GO ON YOU WOULD BE MAD TO MISS IT!!WATCH OUT FOR THE BIRD ON HEAD SCENE-ITS HILARIOUS!!"
4,Charming,"Forget Paris is indeed a charming romantic comedy. Billy Crystal is his usual wise cracking self and Debra Winger fits in decently as his love interest. I like the way the story seems to weave as each of the supporting cast members relate an amusing anecdote about our star couple. Several hillarious moments include when Crystal and Winger are in therapy and the reactions of the different psychologists. Love Crystal's retort to a couple psychologist team,""When do you get involved, when there is gunplay!""Overall, the story is pretty similar to When Harry Met Sally. In some ways its a little irrealsitic. Nonetheless, there are some comedic moments that will keep you amused."
5,Loved This Movie,Great Movie- am a big Billy Crystal Fan and Debra Winger was really good too - Love how the movie kept you guessing till the end
5,Better than Denise Austin ....,"This is a great workout and she goes nice and easy while giving you various options for the stage you are in. She doesn't talk down to you as you work out and the workout is a good one. In Core Condtioning when she says ""now you should be feeling this in you ads"" WOW you are and it's a good burn. Jennifer also gives you a back and forth workout ... meaning you don't do all abs then move to legs ect ect. Nope she does a little abs moves to legs back to abs then back. So just as 1 group is getting a beatin' and feeling tired it's getting a rest in the next mix. This DVD also has 3 workouts for 14.99 where as Denise's offers 2 workouts + 1 additional hip and thighs which is just a repeat of things from the workouts for 14.99. Jennifer's is a better buy for your money and a better workout, too.You won't be spending your money poorly if you get this DVD."
3,Average,"I was somewhat disappointed with this dvd. The dvd is not visually appealing and this seems to have a negative impact on the overall workout. It feels as though I am watching a videotape from the early 80s, rather than a dvd purchased in 2001. If you can get beyond the poor visuals, the workout is good. For an overall much better workout I highly recommend the New York City Ballet Workout or the Power Yoga Complete Workout with Rodney Yee."
3,"Hey, what about ""Cool Water""?","This CD does not feature professional recordings of Elvis Presley. Instead, it features recordings of Elvis and his friends at home playing music, as captured by a home tape recorder. Musical accompaniment is usually limited to either a guitar or a piano. The sound quality isn't all that great, as you might suspect. Elvis often has trouble remembering all the words, and sometimes will substitute curse words for the forgotten parts. Songs are often broken up by the laughter of Elvis and his pals. But it will still be of interest to hardcore Elvis fans. Casual fans probably won't like it too much."
2,Don't Download!!!!,When I bought this game I thought it was great. Then I realized that the routes were under 3 miles long! It is way to hard to wreck your train and when you download it takes away your best train. Try to avoid this game.
5,Start here for knowlege about the Etruscans,"Palotinno keeps the flavor of mystery alive, while revealing the history of the Etruscans. There are newer books, with much more recent scientific explanation, but this book is still a good starting place."
3,O-O-O Johnny Johnny Johnny,Some decent songs mixed with some great ones. Start with one of the collections - and then come back here for more.
4,Love This Fable,I just got into the Fable series and I like what I see. It's like Quentin Tarintino meets Disney. It's your favorite fairy tale characters in these gritty situation. It's awsome!
5,One of the best,"I have been a Nevil Shute fan for a long time. Many have never heard of this author. This is one of my favorites along with ""A Town Like Alice"" and ""Trustee From the Toolroom"". I'm glad to find it in print again so I can replace my very tattered copy and get my 16 year olds to read it!"
4,A fine writer,"I rate this as one of his lesser books, Trustee From The Toolroom, Stephen Morris, and Round The Bend are far better. I have searched for ""Sliderule"" his autobiography and cannot find it."
1,Amazon customer service is BAD!!!,"DO NOT BUY A CELL PHONE FROM AMAZON!!!I bought this phone on Dec 15th, they delayed my ship date from the one promised when I placed the order so I had to call them and change shipping to 2nd day so I can get it by Xmas. They charged me extra. Then after I received the phone I found out the pictures are terrible, it comes out blurry and washed out.I called Amazon to try to get them to upgrade my phone. I was willing to pay extra. I just get the run around. Amazon blames Verizon, Verizon says call Amazon, and so on.DO NOT BUY A CELL PHONE FROM AMAZON!"
2,"Looks good, but that's it","Simple put, The Razr is one of worst & best phones I've ever purchased. I purchased one for me and one for my wife. For a point of reference, my first phone was a Motorola Analog Startac in 1995.I'll lay out the good and bad, and let you decide for yourself.GoodVoice recognition - works very well.Layout and size - Button layout is good and size if great.Screen - Good size and resolutionCamera - Works well if you can get past the Verizon bs to get the pictures off the camera.Audio Quality - Good and good reception.BadSlow - OMG! This phone is so slow. Agonizing slow. Hit menu and wait 3 to 4 seconds for it to come up. Yeah that's right, 4 seconds, I just timed it.Battery - If you plan on talking on this phone, then you need to charge every night. If you talk during the day, charge it when your not on it.Ring - No ring and vib. Only ring or vib.This phone has a lot going for it, but the speed of the menu functions makes all the bells and whistles a distraction."
4,Verison kills the razr. Alltel makes it easy.,I bought the $15.00 1GB microSD card and installed it the first day.Plugged the USB I had for my camera into the phone after formatting the card and downloaded a bunch of songs onto the micro by just drag and drop with windows. Dropped them into the Motorola/shared/audio folder.The phone recognized them right away. I moved some to the phone after it was unplugged and then realized the entire song could be used as ring tones. So I deleted the ones on my phone downloaded MP3 converter and cut into my favorite 20 songs (being careful not to overwrite any.) I saved them into the same folder on the phone with RT in front and moved them from the card to the phone after it was unplugged from the computer. That worked great for ringtones.When I want to download a picture from the phone I just make a copy from the phone to the card then plug the phone into the computer to take it out of the motorola/shared/pictures folder.No need for phone tools...
1,Customer service disaster,"DO NOT buy this phone unless you're willing to endure continuous calls from Verizon Wireless if you try to close your account.Last week, shortly after telling Verizon's sales person I was switching to T-Mobile because their Customer Service is a disaster, I began getting three to five calls each day that hang up as soon as I answer. Doing a *69 revealed they were coming from 1-800-470-0768, Verizon Wireless' number. Calling a supervisor (Jasen) resulted in an apology and him putting me on their Do Not Call list, which he says won't take effect for 30 days. He also said this is a ""known problem with Verizon's auto-dialer"" for which Verizon has no solution. It's only noon and so far today I've gotten three calls from them, two hangups and another sales pitch to upgrade my phones and stay with Verizon Wireless.I'd rather stick needles in my eyes."
3,"Good phone, has a few kinks","Good phone, but you really need to reboot it at least once a day or it acts funky. Not terribly sturdy, but thats not really why you buy it either."
3,My experience with razr,"The batter life was terrible for first 3 days, after speaking for 20 min it will drain completely in next 7 hours. Later after searching on internet, I tried to turn off evdo. And trust me there is a hell lot of difference now. I think now I am getting a talk time of ~2.5 hours and standby of ~2 days.I concluded that even though I was living in urban area but while traveling and over week signal spots the phone keeps searching for evdo digital signals along with wireless signals so it consumes twice power, therefore by turning it off you save a lot of power, forgot to mention Motorola has already packed this phone with heavyduty battery! as compared to past razr models.Pros are good reception, and voice clarity."
1,caviet emptor,"They don't tell you but some are suede and some are cheap nylon fiber netting. When you have a problem, neither Land's End nor Amazon will help. It is like limbo, sending shoes back to 1 place and hoping to be credited in another, with NO customer service!"
2,Not for children,"Although this book is about a 10 year old Samoan girl the subjects the author explores are adult. The book is dark and deals with sexual issues and family violence. I'm not saying the book is without merit. It would surely have a place when studying modern polynesian cultures as an adult, but I think buyers should know that it is inappropriate for children."
4,Great reference,"This little book is actually a gem. It covers a variety of fish illnesses with an introduction that addresses standard care. Unfortunately, some of the medications that it recommends are difficult to relate to the American market, as it was written in the UK. That, and perhaps the lack of more photographs, are the only two complaints that I have. Overall, I recommend this book for the beginner and the professional!"
1,Prepared to be disappointed,"I was all excited to have a modern 3-D saltwater fish screensaver, but the best thing this program can manage is to take your money. Sure it puts fish and the occasional dolphin on your screen but comes up ""criminally"" short in entertainment or fascination."
4,The songs rock - let down by production,"It's a shame that the album sounds kinda muted and muddy, you have to fill in the tunes with your imagination to get the most out each track. Therefore probably not the easiest accessibility for first-time listeners.Seems to be a common issue with many a band, by the time they've developed the production ethos that showcases their work to best advantage, they no longer have their best material to put behind it."
5,I liked this book,I liked Bob Son of Battle because I thought Bob was cute and nice. I didn't like when Bob was eating a lamb and blood was dripping.
2,Not too helpful,"This book has good graphs and short descriptions, especially if you're looking for the quick definition of an economics term, but overall, it is too general and not helpful enough when you are studying for the AP Economics exam. I used it to review, but the book did not go into enough detail to really be of use to me. Also, there were many instances where the notes in the CliffsAP book contradicted with what I had learned in my economics course and in various impressive, reliable textbooks.I do not recommend using this book. It was quite a waste. I have heard that ""5 Steps to a 5 on the AP exam"" is better."
3,I Even LIstened Two It Twice,"No I did not care for this album at all. If my opinion changes, I will return to eat my words."
3,Messy Kindle edition,"The Kindle edition of this wonderful description of Amelia Edwards' voyage has some good points. It has an interactive table of contents (a big plus) and the original illustrations in their right places in the text. The editors have clearly taken some care over these points. But the proof reading is slipshod. The very first line of the book refers to ""table-d'hdtes"" (sic), and there are many other similar errors. The introductory pages contain all kinds of scribbled notes from the library copy from which this book was evidently scanned as well as a lot of blank pages. The tabulation of the Egyptian dynasties in the appendices is a mess. This is really well below the quality of production that Kindle readers are entitled to expect from editors who ask them to pay for out-of-copyright books, and I hope that a new corrected edition can be issued."
1,"Wow, what a deception!","Wow! I guess I got what I paid for. When I saw this item, I was amazed by the ridiculously low price for an ""indestructible blade"". My first impression was, ""Hey, I can use that for a spear point if nothing else"". I read all the details and descriptions. What got me was that they showed the item WITHOUT the packaging. Had they showed it in the package it came in, it would have been very obvious that this was NOT an item I wanted. The wording on the front of the package reads as follows: ""High-Tech Plastic"". The wording on the back of the package reads: ""The safe knife for office, home, garden, and on-the-go!"". And it shows the item being used much as a letter opener.Again, what a deception!"
4,great track-,"If you like Sepultura, you have to give Fudge Tunnel a chance. Hate songs in the E-minor is definately the best of the series."
3,not what I expected,"It's hard to tell from the photo. I wanted something that was shaped more like a spoon, with a bowl shape on the end. This one is so flat you could almost use it as a spatula. It's sturdy and otherwise nice, but if you're looking for a strainer, you might want to look elsewhere."
2,Form Over Function,"I am quite disappointed in this breadbox. It is attractive and sleek (except for a dent), but the metal is flimsier than I had hoped (hence the dent, I suppose). The weightiness that a former reviewer mentioned comes from the wooden base, not the metal. More importantly, though, the box is in no way airtight and even has air holes in the back. As bread should be stored in an airtight container, this box does not serve its purpose well. If you're just looking for something pretty for your kitchen, this works nicely. I, however, will be returning mine for a Brabantia."
4,Nice item,"Nice item, it was mostly what I expected, but my only complaint is that I didn't realize how small it is. It really only fits a couple of bread items (2). Otherwise it's great."
3,"Twain, and free so why not..","I didn't hate it, It was short and a little predictable. Definitely, did not get the same feeling I had when I read Tom Sawyer, or Huck Finn. This seemed more of a side project for Twain than a Thoroughly written Novel. It is however, Twain, and it was a free download so hard to beat it. I wouldn't have minded paying a few bucks to read it.."
5,"Simple Advice You Can USE...from wealthy ""Uncle Michael""","Are you SICK of reading financial advice books written with so much analysis, jargon, and formal posturing...you can't figure out what the heck you're actually supposed to DO? Me, too!That's why I LOVED this book. It's like your super-wealthy Uncle sits down and tells you how he made his fortune...and how you can make yours, too. Simple, practical, straight-from-the-shoulder advice you can USE, no matter where you are in life right now.Quite simply, the best, most practical, easiest-to-understand book of financial advice I've ever read. Do yourself a favor and buy it now!"
3,There are better books out there on this subject,"I had high hope when I pick up this book. Although there are good principles and ideas in the book, but the title is somewhat misleading. It is anything, but auomatic. Doing what author suggested takes a lot of work.It is not easy to become expert in stock investing, real estate investing, starting part time business while hold a full time job (which is in some way is what author suggested that everyone should be doing).I do like author's last charpter about the concept of retirement - the traditional thinking about retire young and doing nothing but enjoy golfing, watch TV and just relax really does not work. I know this first hand. You must have some meaningful work to do during those retirement years. It is something most people really don't plan.Overall, there are good contents in the book, but there are other better book on the same subject.RobertSan Jose"
4,great vacuum,"I used one of these when i was cleaning my wife's company office and really liked it. Our home vacuum would blow dust everywhere even after i cleaned it and checked for leaks. i said the heck with it and bought one of these. i'm glad i did. easy to use, light weight and a great price and i'm dusting a lot less! Some people complain of a short cord,but i don't have a problem with it."
3,Decent for a small space for a short time,"This vacuum is handy to have in a small space because it is small and lightweight, but it's not a great investment for a larger space or for someone who wants a little more lasting power. I find myself constantly having to change the filter, which gets expensive fast."
4,Good product BUT...,"The Eureka is overall a good product for the price, but the vacuum does not glide as smoothly as I would like, it's a tad bit heavy and it is a pain in the butt to change the nasty, dusty filters.Still a nice vacuum with good suction- I sucked up more dirt than I imagined existed in my home!"
2,Bagless-convenience but inconvenient because of the dust cup filter,"Pros: Inexpensive & you don't have to buy bagsCons: You do have to replace the dust cup filter, which is more inconvenient then replacing a vacuum cleaning bag. The dirt tends to stick to the filter so cleaning out the canister and removing the dirt from the filter is time-consuming and creates so much dust around that you would need a dust mask.In short, I wouldn't buy a bagless vacuum cleaner again."
2,Bad Floor Suction - Nice Color Though,"This vacuum has a lot of suction from its hose attachment but almost none through the floor suction. I believe I must have gotten a defective model, but got no help on my first call to Eureka's customer service.My dilemma is whether to live for a while with a product that's barely working or to struggle through the cost/time/effort to get it repaired-especially when considering the low purchase price. (Ah, our throw-away society!)Even if it was working well, the fact that the exhaust blows out the front, chasing the dirt away from you, makes this unit's design questionable.I do love that great spring green color!"
2,Alright... at first.,"This vacuum works fine for hardwood floors AT FIRST. After only a year or so (with pretty infrequent use, might I add), this thing totally conked out and became pretty worthless. Cleaning the floors with damp paper towels was less work and more efficient than pushing this thing around. I live in NYC and see these on the curb as trash ALL the time. Judging from this, I'd venture to guess that I'm not the only dissatisfied owner."
2,Do not buy if you have pet birds,"I had one of these vacuums for a year and it worked great on both bare and carpeted floors. Then the wheel broke off so I got this one. Well this one is a little bit different in design because whereas the old one was great at cleaning up seed off my hardwood floors, this one just blows the seed around. It works great on rugs but horribly on bare floors. Huge disappointment. Time to shop for a new vacuum."
5,Mean Green Machine - 2 Year Update,"We have the 431AXZ with the DCF-10 filter. Our son has one also in his apt. A lot of the reviews complain about the filter. The manual says it's a washable filter - just take it outside and hose it off, let it dry, and re-install. If you don't read the manual, you'll end up banging the filter and trying to pick all the lint out.We've had it almost 2 years now doing carpet in a 2100 sf home. No problems, always works well. Filters last over 6 months before needing replacement, and you can find the original DCF-10 in stock at Lowe's for $10. Walmart carries a wannabe paper filter replacement that can't be washed clean. Use the DCF-10! I'm not a filter salesman, I'm just here to tell you this machine works well, and if you follow the instructions, the filter isn't an issue."
1,VERY BAD FOR THE JOB,THE FRONT WHEELS OF THE VACUUM CLEANER ARE VERY SMALL WITH THE RESULT THAT THEY GET CAUGHT IN THE CARPET AND ONE HAS TO PUSH REALLY VERY HARD TO GET THE JOB DONE. IT IS NOT WORTH FOR EVEN $10.00.INDRU MALKANI
2,Canister and Filter are Messy to Empty!,"Do not buy this vacuum if you have a pet. Cleaning out the canister is a very MESSY job and the dirt and pet hair stick all over the filter. Replacement filters are difficult to find and must be ordered on-line. I've put up with this vacuum for a year and I'm now buying a new BAGGED vacuum. I've put up with it this long because it is very lightweight, it has a nice retractable handle, and you can set it to ""suction only"" and use it on bare floors. But cleaning out the dirt and pet hair is messy, messy, messy."
1,I hate this vaccum,"It's light, but the Hepa filter fills up so often as to make me prefer a broom... okay, I've got two cats, so I've learned to set up a chair by a waste basket and clean the filter with a plastic fork two or three times each time I clean the living room.There must be a better product out there."
1,Not all that ..........,"This is not your everyday vacuum . If you are going to use it once a month then maybe its for you . I had the motor go out about the third hour that I used it . I have a cleaning business and liked the light weight , but it just did not cut it ."
5,Elegant and Simple,I purchased this item as a door prize for a tea party bridal shower. It arrived just a pictured and is really beautiful. Great quality for the price.
3,I dont beleive it completly covers season 1,"From what i understand this only consists of the first 13 episodes. The first season of one piece is the first 50 episodes, currently there are over 350 episodes so this indicates funimation is making a terrible mistake in planning DVD releases."
3,"Great translation, uncut video, however...","Funimation does a great job with translation on this box set, keeping it uncut in both video and audio. English voices are excellent (coming from a guy who is also watching the sub of the current episodes). The only gripe I have with this box set is the amount of episodes. They should have had at least double what they included (26 vs. 13)."
2,i don't get it - maybe i'm too uncool,The Velvet Underground is a favorite of mine. They became a great band AFTER this mess was recorded. I try listening to it once in a while to see if it has anything to offer and I come up empty. The singer Nico does a decent Marianne Faithfull impression when she's not sounding like she's about to drift into a heroin coma.
1,...,"This is one of the worst albums I have ever heard in my life; the singing is horrible and the lyrics are insipid..,no amount of drug referecesare going to save tuneless concoctions such as ""waiting for the man"" and ""Run Run Run."" Nico is a true horror, her...voice makes unlistenable material ""Femme Fatale etc."" even worse. Lou Reed was (and still is) a writer of unmelodic and uninteresting song rendered listenable only by the occasional collaboration with a brilliant producer. The only thing that makes this album tolerable is John Cale, whose viola renders certain song (Heroin, Venus in Furs) and listenable and sometimes even beautiful. The ominous shrieks actually provide a line of melody where previously there would have been none."
1,ARGH,"I guess the best part of getting this was that it was totally free.No wonder why it's free, though..."
3,I have wanted to know,I have always wanted to know about the sayings of Confucius. They are alright and sometimes get to the point of a situation.
1,Bad,"John was quite ill when he made this record, and it shows. There's no inspiration, and no syncopation. Everything is tired, flat, listless, dull. You'll never find a more apt title on anyone's album than ""Minutes Seem Like Hours, the Hours Seem Like Days"". So this is for completists only. As the album title itself says ""I Remember 'Blind Joe Death'"" - now THAT was a great album!"
4,"No ""nice people"" in this book","If you want to like the subject of your book, you should find another book. There is no one totally likable in this book. If you think some one was innocent, you should check again.However, I like flawed characters, so I enjoyed this novel.The ending was a bit trite but the book had to end.Better then a Lifetime movie but not as good as HBO."
4,Good versus Evil....with a twist,"The Lost King is a very good novel centering around two individuals who are mind-linked. These two individuals were part of an elite military corp responsible for the protection of the royal family. The royal family was killed in a bloody rebellion except for one survior. The few elite military people remaining try to hide the existence of this child. Unfortunately, the one who led the rebellion is a traitor from this elite group. These three end up together at the same time and place. Now the battle continues as to who will live and who will die. This is a great novel that you will definetly enjoy!"
5,The beginning of a journey.,"I really owe a debt of thanks to Margeret Weis for writing these books. Seven years ago I was like most teenagers in the world today, my interests pretty much consisted soley of TV. I would occasionally go to the library and take out books, usually hard science science-fiction books. One day in there I saw The Lost King and decided to take it out. That's the day that I'm able to point back and say that I began my journey in literature.The book is great! The series is great! It starts out very Star Warsyish and then takes over and draws you in. I've read the series countless times since then. I've read a thousand other books since these. It all comes back to these books. I'd be a very different person if I hadn't found them.If you haven't read them yet... please do. It's just a superb story."
4,DVD for Forbidden Planet,Rec'd DVD in excellent condition and reviewed vidio twie without any oriblem.Forbidden Planet is a movie I saw with my fother when I was a kid. It has fond memories for me.I rate this seller excellent. I rec'd the DVD in a timely mannor.Sincerely071909
5,A classic that still holds up well,"A little dated in some respects, this is a MUST-SEE film. The Shakespearean plot and the psychological subplot have far greater depth of content than most of what studios churn out today, and the Krell matte paintings are iconic. While it lacks the seamless realism of CGI imagery, little of what's being put out know approaches its matte paintings for artistic quality."
4,Forbidden Planet (Ultimate Collector's Edition),"This is a great product. The color is vibrant (but the original was much duller and this makes some scenes seem a bit strange) and the added items on the CD are interesting for someone like myself who believes that this is one of the greatest old science fictions films. The box is very cute but came slightly dented from shipping. The Robbie doll is cute also.My major criticism is that there was no text with the package that described the history or actors, for example. When I noticed that the color seemed brighter I thought that the original might have been in black and white but could not find any info in the package about it."
4,Robby Robot Rules,"This movie is one hour and 38 minutes long and was released on March 15, 1956. Since this movie is based on Shakespeare's The Tempest, a book I never read, I cannot do a compare and contrast. In the movie, you can see some effects that Star Trek used in its television show. Basically the movie is set in the year 2200 and a group of soldies is sent to the planet Altair IV to find out what happen to a group of scientists who try to colonize the planet 20 years ago. Once the expedition reaches the planet reaches the planet the find the three remaining survivors. Robby The Robot, Dr. Edward Morbius, and Altaira ""Alta"" Morbius. Murders start turning up when an invsible creature start attacking the crew. The movie does have some laughs and tries to make a statement. I would recommend this movie to any. Just for the special effects alone."
4,Brings back memories,"I've been looking for original early science fiction movies, Forbidden Planet was always one of my favorites. This package has it all. The price was right, let your kids see what was real our vision of the future."
5,Forbidden Planet,Forbidden Planet DVD is excellent. The DVD was received in excellent condition and before scheduled delivery date.
4,Very Good,"overall the movie was good, I thought this version would have had the interviews with the actors still alive concerning the movie"
5,Epic Icon of scifi movies. A MUST.,"This is an icon of scifi movies. A must see for anyone. A masterpiece of special effects for it's time. Fantastic all around. Of course, the ending could give kids nightmares, lol. WOW! Love it! You will see many actors you will recognize."
1,Forbidden Planet,"I ordered the movie Forbidden Planet (NEW) through Amazon.com, when I received the DVD the disk inside was not the DVD I ordered, isted, the titled DVD that was in the factory sealed Forbidden Planet pakage, was ""THREE TO TANGO"", I cannot find a proceedure or a method to resolve this situation on the amazon.com web site. I am out $14.99, and I still do not have a copy of Forbidden Planet. My sudgestion, is do not buy this DVD online anywhere, but rather, buy it from a local store, where you can take it back, if you are unlucky enough to get stuck like I did."
4,Not quite perfect Blu-ray transfer,"This review is about is about the Blu-ray transfer, not the movie itself which I love. Overall the transfer looks nice, the only thing I take issue with is that when they do the fades and dissolves between scenes. Whenever that happens all the effects they have used to enhance the original film disappear and you are left viewing the original source film, which I found jarring and decreased the enjoyment of the viewing experience. It looks like they put this through a computer on cruse control but it couldn't deal with the fading out, so it just doesn't apply any processing. Anyway, it's still a large improvement over my old DVD."
3,Send-away poster destroyed in shipping,"I have to agree with others on here who've taken Warners to task for the packaging of some of the items in this collector's set. My DVDs were not damaged. But the send-away replica poster arrived after a six-week wait and was in a tube so bent and broken that the only thing to be done with the poster was to throw it out. That's essentially what has happened with the other posters from other WB campaigns like ""The Searchers."""
5,Forbidden Planet,"In a decade of giant bugs movies and ultra low budgets Forbidden Planet stands out as a film of wit, intelligence and impressive special effects.Well worth the viewing. The extras are a must for the person who likes the inside look of the film making process.Now that the cast is all gone I wonder where Robbie the Robot is these days?"
3,Good,"I came into this film with low expectations and walked away enjoying this movie very much. Ryan Reynolds really impressed me with his acting ability and I really did buy into and got into the storyline. The ending seemed kind of weak, but made sense. There was a build up, and a fizzle ending, but it still didn't hurt the overall film. So, I don't know if you will enjoy the movie if you expect a lot, but if you come in with low expectations-you can only go up from there. A real enjoyable movie that worth watching at least once, but I don't know if I'd want to see it more than that."
3,kinda scary,this movie has it's scary moments but often boring.it's still alright to put it in the horror section.your not missing anything in this one
3,This movie's okay,"Family moves into haunted old house only for it to be cursed and religious hating and the family gets torn apart. Though this movie is sure to suck the first time you see it, it gets better every time. Even if only a little bit. Pizza and Pepsi."
2,A remake? loosely based on,"The orignal movie was not scary and not overly good, but was more belivable then this. Based on a true story is misleading, as you think some events cannot happen, but some events could happen. The movie does have a nice 70's feel to it, but as it being a true story-highly unlikely. It uses ""remake"" effects to get scares, and that makes it unbearable. Remake effects meaning showing dead bodies in the room with the characters, something that doesnt happen in the orignal. Stuff guys crave to see, and scares there girl friends. I admit Teaxas Chainsaw Massacre from this guy was a little better because you saw Leatherface more, but this movie is limp and should have stuck to the orignal."
2,"Cheesy then, and cheesy now","Based on the allegedly non-fiction book (which has been proved a hoax), the Amityville Horror came off as a cheesy Exorcist rip-off back in 1979, and nothing has changed. James Brolin and Margot Kidder star as a couple who, along with their kids, move into a very, very haunted house, and of course, bad things start happening rather quickly. Rod Steiger appears out of nowhere as a priest who (of course) knows what's going on, and (of course) has the best demise in the film. Everything about the Amityville Horror is pure cheese; from the acting to the effects, with no real sense of horror in sight. Other horror flicks of this type, like Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper's original Poltergeist and Robert Wise's original Haunting, are much more worth your time. Amityville Horror was cheesy then, and it's still cheesy now, and the upcoming remake even looks better than this."
4,amityville,"dear amazon, if you're ever looking for a brand new house in a quiet neighborhood for you and your family make sure you choose carefully. you see, if your agent says that the house was built on an ancient native burial ground and that the previous owner went completely nuts and butchered his own family then maybe you want to reconsider and look for other options. even if he gives you a good deal. you see, thats what happened in this movie amazon. this nice guy took the deal thinking everything would be fine but he was wrong. mom says this guy was a fool. she says no deal is worth losing your family. anyway amazon, thats when the scary part started. the ghosts and the demons came from right under the door and drove that guy completely crazy. anyway, the movie is scary but its good. you watch out for scary house amazonyour frind kent"
3,Good Horror movie...,"This was a good horror movie that I enjoyed. It was pretty entertaining and had its very scary parts. It was different from the original in some ways, but was similar in most parts. It was a little grotesque and over the top in some parts in my opinion, but all in all I enjoyed it. I think it was a good horror movie and I found some parts scary but not the scariest horror movie I have seen, although one of my buddies was freaked."
4,"Call Me Crazy, But I liked it!","This movie is based on events that may or may not have really happened. I think some stuff here is true, but I'm sure some stuff is over-done for the case of being cinematic (walls bleeding, goo, pathway to Hell). ... I liked it. It had a very creepy musical score...and the acting was fairly OK, though some stuff didn't make sense. I mean, what was with that pig with red eyes that we see for half a second and then never again?"
3,The Amityville Horror(Stop Remaking Movies!!),"The movie is a remake of the Original Which I prefer, I always prefer the Original, Remakes always are bad, this movie is not horrible, it is scary, but Great it is not, And Ryan Reynolds? Come on? Is it a Horror Movie or Comedy?"
4,Good film for its time,This film had me on edge when I was 10 good to show your kid's when you want them to stop watching cartoon's and start watching more mature movie's.
3,I like Ryan Reynolds,I bought this film because I am a Ryan Reynolds fan and the price was right == one cent + shipping!
4,Not as bad as the critics allege,"Professional movie critics LOVE to bash this movie, yet I think it's fairly well done. I liked the main characters, especially James Brolin (George), who slowly gets crankier and meaner as the film progresses. This picture has a lot of similaries to ""The Shining"" & ""Poltergiest"", though it's not as scary. The script in ""Amityville"" is a bit creaky at times, and I'm aware the Amityville Horror story is probably a hoax, but I still say this film deserves more respect than it gets."
1,This is a fake!,"George and Kathleen Lutz, the people who stayed at 112, Ocean Avenue, Amityville, New York, for a very brief time because they claimed they were disturbed by very supernatural causes. I will not deny that there were murders at the house because there were murders but they weren't from supernatural causes or demons. The DeFeos (the whole family except for Ronald DeFeo Jr.) were murdered by the oldest son of the family, Ronald DeFeo Jr. He is currently serving time. The Amityville community confirms that the supernatural things claimed by the Lutzs are just nothing but a hoax to get publicity recognize them. Jay Anson wrote a fake story. I wouldn't want to see a fake movie where the people say it's a true story but it's not. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!..."
3,okay,I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would. It has some suspense.Good for an afternoon scare.
2,fair to poor,"Generally good acting, especially by Rod Steiger, and sexy shots of Margot Kidder, but an uninteresting slow unresolved story about a haunted house with copies of scenes from Poltergeist and The Exorcist."
4,good movie,"Personally, I thought this movie was very well done and enjoyed it. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys good movies, specifically ones that are a little scary."
5,The Amityville Horror is 1 of the best scary movies of 2005,the remake the amityville horror remake is so mush better because one thing it does is stays more to the book version of the true story how it really happen in that house.i have to say that this is the ORIGANEL amityville horror!!!! because it stays much closer to the story of the book.if u have not seen this movie yet u r missing out go check it outremember it stays CLOSER to the story of the book then the 1 first one and is more scary than the 1 so go see and leave the show.. with goosebumps so go have a goodtime.hey and bring a date bye!!!
2,A remake that shouldn't have been done.,"This remake was bad! I didn't follow the original plot and seemed really made up. I thought the acting was generic and bad. They did a horrible job at making it feel as if it were the 70's. And worst of all, they didn't have the seen with the flashing red lights out the window. WHAT KIND OF A DIRECTOR WOULD DO THAT!! Destroy an original. That's horrible. Check out the original if you want a good movie."
4,Women of Purpose (Focus on the Family),A great look into what we as believers should put our hope in and how we should approach each experience in our lives. Addresses issues frequently arising in a woman's life.
5,thinking about re-uping,"Bought this cologne in a department store in the Philippines. Paid top dollar for it, unlike the prices here on amazon. But I wanted some cologne, smelled many, and this was my favorite in the store. My bottle is almost empty at this point and I'd consider buying more."
5,Level 42,This awesome vintage Level 42 from their early days in there career. You can't find this sound from musicians anymore in my opinion.
4,"The ""Missing"" Instruction Book","I bought a real nice exercise band set from BMP. The set is great and well made, but what was missing was a good set of instruction (they had a single sheet of paper with only 6 exercises) - I've never used exercise bands before.The Great Stretch Tubing Handbook was just what I needed. A real nice collection of well illustrated (photos) exercises. I also appreciate the extense set of stretching exercises.There is a great variety of upper-body exercises, but I do wish there was a little more lower-body.All-in-all a great little book -- even if it is 2 or 3 dollars more than I would expect to pay for a book this size."
1,Horrible!!!!,"Don't let the title mislead you. It is not a drama about an Indian woman, but a cheap flick about a white man looking for ""thrills"" in Cambodia! This movie should have never been released on DVD!!!:x"
3,"Probably as good nutritionally as athletic greens from four hour body, but tastes like vomit","So I got the four hour body book and bought everything in there. I was pretty shocked at the price of the ""athletic greens"" recommended - it's like $100+ for a 30 day supply. It was however, delicious. I looked forward to it. After I ran out, I bought this, which is like half the cost for double the amount--- that seemed great. But good god, this tastes like vomit. Nothing I can do. I dread it. Really gross. Can't manage to swallow it quick enough not to taste it. So I think I'll go back to the taking the pain in my wallet vs. my mouth. I mean seriously, I already am taking cold showers, eating cinnamon, no sugar, no bread... but this is a little much."
5,BEST KEPT SECRET,"THIS PRODUCT ROCKS!!!!!!IT KEEPS MY PH BALANCED, GIVES ME A BOOST IN MY ENERGY, SUPPLEMENTS MY DIET, AND KEEPS MY HEALTH IN CHECK!!I DRINK 2 DRINKS DAILY,,1 DRINK I TAKE IN MY WATER BOTTLE TO THE GYM, 1 BOTTLE TO WORK.I SWEAR BY THIS DRINK...IF YOU WANT TO FLUSH THE DAY TO DAY TOXICITY FROM YOUR DIET, THIS IS IT!"
4,"Good stuff, but doesn't keep well even in freezer. Help me with suggestions?","I like the way it feels and I keep the container in the freezer, as suggested. I've been an Amazon subscribe & save user of this for over a year. However, about halfway through (on multiple tubs) it gets a progressively worse taste and not nearly as fresh at the beginning. I'm suspecting that the tub itself is not very good for in the freezer and need to put in a different storage container. Anyone else have same experiences or storage suggestions?"
5,A Green Drink I Can Have,"My nutritionist suggested Green Vibrance, and to be honest, I was skeptical. I've had ""green drinks"" before, and they smelled and tasted the same: like low tide. I had to chug them like a shot of tequila. This is the first green drink I actually like! It tastes very much like fresh lettuce leaves, which is quite pleasant. I might actually make it past a week with keeping up with my prescribed green drink!Please note that once opened, it needs to be in the fridge/freezer. Not a big deal, but just an FYI.I feel myself getting healthier already! :)"
4,great boost,GV was recommended to me by my nutritionist and I haven't looked back since then. It's a natutal energy boost before or after the gym
1,meh,"I'm not sure of how much better my body was when taking this, but this stuff tasted NASTY. I'm pretty good when it comes to food and I'll eat practically anything but this stuff is off my list for life. One of the few tastes that made me nauseated."
3,Go slowly!,I think this product is very good for people but go slowly! Other members of my family take it and feel it is good for their health. Some of us have jumped right in and taken the required amount only to find it constipating. It seems to work better if you start with less and slowly build up to the suggested amount.
3,Hold your nose!,"I've been drinking this for a month....the taste...definitely leaves something to be desired. I can tolerate it MUCH better if I drink it mixed with grape juice and hold my nose. It sure does keep you ""regular"" though!!!"
5,Great product,"I am still waiting to see just how well it works. Have only used it for a little over a onth,but have already ordered more. I have gotten used to the taste, but not the looks of this product.I blend it with V-fusion juice and a little lemon and lots of ice. I think I may have become ddicted to it. Just hope it works, and that I really am getting all the veggies and fruits I need in one large glass of green stuff!!!!"
5,Geen Vibrance-Awesome,"I love this product! I mix it in with applejuice or put it in a smoothie. I've been using it for a couple of months now and I feel stronger, have more energy and my IBS is gone! It is rather expensive but definitely worth it."
5,AWSOME PRODUCT!!!,"I have been taking this product for almost 2 months. I was diagnose with diabetes and felt very tired. To my amazement I notice after taking green vibrance, more energy, happier mood, and more alert. I recommend this product to anyone who wants ENERGY in a very safe way! Believe me your life will change with this product!! Thank God I found it!"
3,It's ok,"I've been using this powder for about two months now. The only difference I notice is the white spots on my nails have disappeared. Other then that, I don't feel or look any different. I've been taking it twice a day, morning and night. I haven't been taking a multivitamin but I wonder if I still should. I have tried other powders and they're all pretty much the same to me, I buy this one for the probiotics which I need more than anything. The taste is ok compared to others. Very tolerable."
5,Not happy with new pricing ploy,To get the old $58 price I need to subscribe now? Terrible idea. Love the product but won't go for this price gauge.
4,Visionary Blues,"John Mayall's bands have been training grounds for many a guitarist. John had just given up Mick Taylor to the Stones and he didn't have a drummer. So John decided to put together a lineup with NO drummer. Unheard of in Rock or a Blues band. But it worked.This album is a great album recorded live that leans more towards jazz than blues. It is a must have album. My personal favorites are ""California"" and ""Room to Move"" The band is tight and the songs are some of Mayall's best."
4,It was a turning point,"This was a real gem back when it was first released. It still is. John Mayall, chose to do a kind of ""unplugged"" album, sans drums, progressive jazzy bass lines, a classical guitar, harmonica, steel string guitar... it was a cool, breezy sounding release."
5,I love John Mayall,"This is one of best albums. His old Blues breakers albums are the best. Players like Clapton,Page and Green all on the same album is hard to beat. I got to see him live and talk to him and he is a great guy who got many greats started."
4,Excellent resource,"My wife read this book. She found it to be just what she was expecting. It gave her good insights for herself and for those to whom she ministers everyday.Our shame, whether it is legitimate or not, gets in the way of our relationships, both with people and with God. Until we deal with the shame in our lives and with the source of that shame we will be unable to become fully intimate with anyone."
3,the good soldier,i know this is considered a classic but i found it a bit of a bore and wanted to shake the narrator out of his torpor. he was unbelievably naive and obtuse beyond belief. i also watched the film version to see if i had missed the point and found it only reinforced my attitude.
1,Horrendous,"""Currently unavailable"" . . . I should have been so lucky when I stumbled upon this stinkeroo a few years back. The ""Greatest Hits"" are unrecognizable. Either this is a vanity project or it's Mr. Burdon gleaning new performance royalties. I'm giving it one star only because zero is currently unavailable."
4,Godflesh's best,"First, a correction. Contrary to underwhelmingly brief review by Amazon staffer Jeff Bateman, Godflesh hail from Birmingham, England. Founding members Justin Broadrick and Ben Green, in fact, played in the earliest mid-80's incarnation of those godfathers of Grindcore, Napalm Death.At any rate, Pure is the apotheosis of the Godflesh sound, a heady mixture of synthetic backbeat and crunching guitar. But unlike earlier Godflesh releases, this album positively swings. The beats are much more inventive here, catapulting the material beyond grindcore or even industrial. Although many later industrial/metal acts took a lesson or two from the Godflesh playbook, none have since equaled the power or fury of this one great release.And it sounds just as heavy, hypnotic and mysterious as it did the day it was released."
5,Thin Slicer,I just love this cheese slicer. It produces very thin clean cut slices of cheese and is really easy to clean. I do not put it in the dish washer.
4,good instructional DVD,"There are very few DVDs on candle dancing and this one is very good. It has general instruction, some combos to inspire you and a candelabra performance at the end.I didn't give it 5 stars because I would have liked a longer DVD for the price, with more instruction especially using candles. I thought the movements were rather easy, consisting mostly in hip circles, figure 8's and some arm movements but the section on belly rolls was excellent."
4,It good enough,I just wish these guys had a little more edge to them. Most of them are good but some of them just need a little more edge and soul.
3,I'm a sucker for Chasing Cars,"As a rule I'm not a terribly sentimental person but well-written, intelligent power ballads seem to get me every time...hearing ""Chasing Cars"" reminded me of the majestic sound of hearing Coldplay's ""Yellow"" for the first time. The rest of the album is on the pop side of alternative music, but the songs are catchy, reasonably intelligent, and well-played. A lot more accessible than their last album (Final Straw) which I actually liked but was a bit more challenging than this one. I recommend this, but you should know what you're getting---a good collection of pop songs with an alternative feel to them. (and having the wonderful Martha Wainwright sing on one track certainly does not hurt their alt-rock credibility!!!)"
5,Neo-rock songs,"This album contains a lot of good songs, specially the first 4 songs. Definitely worth every cent."
3,"3.5 stars: Indeed, ""easy listening indie pop""","Indie rock will not get any more commercial or easy to listen than Snow Patrol's latest album... I hope. Or it will have to stop being called ""indie"". Bad? Not really. Basic? Flat? Yes, and then some. I had enjoyed their previous album (gave it four stars, if I remember correctly), but this one sounds like a fabricated blend between Death Cab For Cutie, Doves and Matchbox.After giving it a shot, it continues to feel just a bit above an average album: for each song that stands out, there's one or two that leave the band in a place where they sound blah. Highlights of the album: ""Chasing Cars"", ""Shut Your Eyes"", ""You Could Be Happy"", ""Set Fire To The Third Bar"" and the closing track. The rest of the material I can totally live without."
3,I knew it...,"Last month I happened to switch on VH1 in the middle of a video. The lead singer was mentioning Sufjan Stevens and was jumping around in front of the mic like Bono in that Beautiful Day video. I said to myself, ""Whoever these jerks are, they should be namedropping Coldplay and not Sufjan."" I immediately assumed it was some new group jumping on the piano-rock bandwagon. Then the video ended and the display said Snow Patrol, and I nearly cried. I thought maybe it's just one song, it doesn't mean the whole album will be like this. Surely the rest of the tracks are pure mopey pop like we've come to expect. Sadly that is not the case. Eyes Open isn't a bad album necessarily, but it's rather generic and doesn't stand up to their old material. What's next, Spoon doing screamo?"
2,Disappointing,"I love Snow Patrol, I really do. Final Straw is a great album and it made me go out and buy their older stuff (that I could find). I even saw them last year at Coachella and was really impressed by their live show.But this album is really disappointing.It's really produced, to the point where it seems like the question when recording it was ""how do we make this song appeal to the most people?"" There's an edginess that's lost on this album. To that end, it doesn't feel as sincere, either.The vocals are probably the easiest to point to, as what once sounded like heartfelt indie rock now seems like light rock crooning.I had high hopes for Snow Patrol -- and for this album -- but those hopes weren't realized."
4,Worth listening to and watching a little,"I thought the sound was fantastic, earthy and clear. Every instrument could be heard. I enjoyed it immensely. However watching it? I could only take it in small doses because the quick cut style got to be really annoying after 3 songs. Some great moments were captured, and Tom's smile is worth the price of admission, but I tend to like the Martin Scorsese style in The Last Waltz...keep the camera still and let us absorb the charisma of the artists.Still.... an exciting show which included the super talented bassist ( sadly missed) Howie E."
2,Great Concert Bad DVD,"The concert was great. The audio well done. The viewing was like being on a merry go round. The director never held a shot more than a few seconds. It gave me a headache. I ended up re recording it onto an audio disk to listening to it. Mr. Petty please do another DVD concert, but change the director. I enjoyed the concert, but couuldn't handle the constant video cuts."
3,Pretty good.,"Something to Talk About starring Julia Roberts and Dennis Quaid is a good chick flick. The two stars are funny and have natural chemistry but the person who really steals every scene is Kyra Sedgwick who plays Robert's meddlesome sister, she's a firecracker in this movie. I like this movie but it's not perfect, some imperfections here and there. If you are fan of Roberts then check this romantic comedy out!"
1,Worst. AP prep book. Ever.,"This book is downright terrible. It seems as though it was written by several different people, none of whom communicated with one another and none of whom had a very good handle on physics. There are gaping errors in chapters and AP tests, and the practice AP tests are extremely confusing and misleading- something the actual AP test is not."
4,Good Enough,Good enough for most people. Not even close to good enough for someone who is at one of the best technology and engineering schools in the world. I was just going to use it for a casual reference text. But I found out I had already memorized almost all the content so this book was almost useless for me.
2,There is an error on page 3,"On page 3, it says students may not take physics B and physics C in the same year. This is wrong; I asked the ETS (the folks that conduct the AP Program) and they said ""Students are permitted to take any of the Physics' exams in the same year.""!"
5,Great mount,"Strong, very good mount, I recommend it, I have a 58"" samsung plasma on it and it looks strong as a rock on my living room wall"
2,perhaps more for dancers and relaxation than exercise,"I consider myself an intermediate level of fitness and am somewhat flexible due to martial arts. I own a lot of workout videos and aside from regular weight/cardio training, I enjoy pilates a bit more than yoga.Somehow this dvd did not work for me. There was a bit too much dancing and other moves and and did not seem to have much pilates. Overall it may be good for those into dance and a more relaxing experience."
2,Find Ways to Supplement Your Studies,"It's not a bad idea to include this book in your studies. Yes, the reviews are primarily true-that being that the content is just too light and that the sample test are way different from the real CSET test.Beef up by using E.D. Hirsch's, Scholastics, and going online to some of the educational websites. It's not a bad idea to order some of the new ones that are coming out (although it seems that some may be worse than the Cliff's). You need to get your hands on MORE resources so that you can walk into the testing room feeling confident that you will pass it."
2,Read the Reviews,"I've taken the test for the CSET multiple subject, and I can honestly say that the Cliff's book is really poorly edited and drafted for the CSET multiple subject. I'm not sure where the poster who was hyping about the book is coming from, but you really need to look into other resources to study from. The practice tests in the Cliff's is NOT representative of the actual test. The official CSET website is a good way to go. Keep your chin up, save your money, and do well on the exam."
3,"Some things are good, and some things are not helpful","I am using this book to study for my Multiple Subject CSET exam. Let me tell you what I have found useful about this book, as well as the areas that did not help in this book. First of all, I like the fact that there are two practice exams in the back of the book. They have the answers for the practice exams, as well as the explanations for the answers in the case that you would like to go over them afterwards. However, I agree with some of the other reviews posted here, and I am very disappointed in the content and the review sections. The information reviewed in each of the subjects does not nearly go into the depth of the knowledge needed for the exam. In my opinion, it doesn't efficiently review the test taker for the CSET Exam."
2,Cheap Outline...Not A Good Source,"The theory of organization in this book was good, but in practice it was a disaster. The book includes subtests to show you your trouble areas, which I thought was helpful. however, the actual review sections are poorly put together and leave out a lot of crucial information. It doesn't explain, but rather just gives vague statements and drawings. On one of the sample questions it talks about what a paper will look like after being folded and cut in a certain way. As an explanation for this answer, the authors simply state to cut it out and see for yourself. Well, that's not very a practical explanation as you can't do that during the test. I haven't gotten my scores back from the CSET yet, but it was ugly that day."
2,Same material as Old MSAT,"Book gave a nice overview of the CSET content, but I thought it wasn't as thorough as it should of been. There were lots of questions on the CSET test that wasn't covered on the practice tests or in the contents. The best way to go is to use Hirsch's books. It helped out. And to any new students taking the CSET, don't purchase any of the products from Teaching Solutions. I had just learned that it is a scam, and the CD (they say they have a book, but they don't) is just filled with useless, garbled information."
2,Just OK...Disappointing,"This CD was a disappointment to me. It was boring. The exercisesare OK but Sunshine continues to smile eerily and breathing cues,which could have been incorporated easily to assist participant,were sacrificed for Sunshine's continuous smile."
4,Great,It's a great DVD for the elderly. Very easy to do and she does them slow enough for everyone to keep up with. I would recommand this to anyone.
4,"Son of a Man, an insight to paraguayan behaviour.","After reading about the military operations in the Chaco War, I wanted to know further and read contemporary literature of both beligerents. Son of a Man is much more, it is itself a brief history of the generation to be involved in that bloody war, that bled white both paraguay and bolivia's populations. Son of a Man is the story of common people, and through their lives the history of a country is knit."
4,Must have for the collection,"For all you old school 70's rockers, add this to the collection. Like many of the great rock and roll bands, live is best. Good keyboard sounds on the live which is not as clear on studio Rainbow. Some feedback sounds during recording. Great Blackmore and Coverdale for thin air guitar and dashboard drummers."
1,Not the Edition Pictured,The book I received was the 3rd edition not the 5th as pictured. The copy I received was in black and white. I was very disappointed.
3,A book for beginning quilters,"A book for beginning quiltersThe directions are clear. The Pictures are ""dull"" - there is no verity in colors - the same quilt colors in different assembling of the units."
5,Great Book!,"I was required to purchase this book, in conjunction with a ""Quilt in a Day"" Class offered at a local fabric store. During the class, and with the aid of this book, I began my first quilt. I have nearly completed the initial quilt, a second quilt and begun preparations (fabric selection and cutting) for a third. I love this book! The instructions are straightforward and simple. And although I have not yet managed to actually complete an entire quilt (much less in a day), my projects thus far have gotten rave reviews! None of this would have been possible without this book. Great book!"
2,average book with a great message,"I don't mean no disrespect to the author. I think she had good intentions for writing this book. I just think that as a writer, she missed the mark.After reading the reviews, I went out and bought the book,expecting a good read. What I got instead was a preachy self help book.I think that this book is good for people who may have had problems with drugs or have with dealt with addicted spouses. But for those of us who are looking for a good read, this is not the book for you. It's not a page turner, it not a book you try to stay up late to finish reading. In fact, I didn't even finsh reading the book. The preachy messages after the diary entries were just too annoying and distracting. The messages should have been saved for the ending or epilogue.For an exciting novel about drugs, I would recommend Crack Head by Lisa Lennox or Harlem Girl Lost. Both of these books were excellent."
4,Origin of the Legend,"This first T. Rex album (July 1968) introduced to the world a quixotic character, a self-promoting pixie who sang incomprehensibly in a voice equal parts Donovan and Tiny Tim. It would be a few more albums before his song-writing hit its stride, and a few more after that before his self-promotion peaked, but here at the beginning most of the elements of the Legend Bolan were already in place.This is a first class reissue, with both mono and stereo mixes, outtakes and a single. The extensive liner notes by Rexaholic Mark Paytress, rare photos and complete lyrics fill out the deluxe packaging."
5,A Deer-iffic Book,"If you love snow, this book is for you. I'll leave the mystery up to you. Anyways, they visit a cabin. Then, after Tom Nelson finds his recipie for his father's secret buns he names it after Benny. Benny's Buns. The recipie is in the book."
1,Does not Lock,"If you came here to buy a bike lock, turn around now; here be demons. Although they give you three keys, they only give you one lock, which incidentally does not actually unlock. If you do want to lock something and leave it there to the end of time, then buy this lock. If you want to utilize the aforementioned thing, then don't buy this scam."
2,Nice looking but not dish-washer safe,This tenderizer looks and feels good. But for something that deals with raw meat not to be dish-washer safe is not acceptable for us. The item description online doesn't indicate this fact. There is a small sticker on the side of the tenderizer regarding this fact once we received the item. Never used it.
3,NO MOTHER LOVE HERE!,"The book was typical Fern Michaels. I have enjoyed all of them. This book ended strangely, I thought, with Nealy packing up the bodies of her dead horses....and dead husband....and moving away.I can't believe she was so mean spirited towards her daughter, just because she didn't do things her mothers' way.I was horrified with the epilogue. What mother would not try to understand her daughter, and finally give her the love she deserved. Just because she didn't want to run a race, she left her. Nealy was a b...h."
5,Excellent Series,"I never thought about it but after I read the reviews, I guess someone who hadn't read the entire series might be lost but this is one of the best series of book I have ever read. If you start at the beginning with the Texas series the books are fantastic."
3,"Cute idea, not so cute pictures","The story was really cute. The pictures were sort of ugly. I feel sort of guilty saying that, because really, the story is really cute and baby loves the book. But, I don't like reading it because I have to look at the picture of the baby in the book."
3,Actual Size,I thought backpack was larger. A picture with a size reference by the side would have helped. I fits Just a camera and two lenses plus some small other accesories. If you plan to take just a bottle of water it wont fit.
2,Tooooo Small,"This bag is way too cramped. I have a Canon T1i camera body, a 70-200mm zoom, a 50mm fixed lens, Tamron 10-24mm zoom and a speedlite 270 flash. It takes all of my patience to cram most of it in the bag and zip the lid closed. No way all of it will fit. From the photos on line it appeared to have room for a camera and up to about 4 lenses. I just received it 4 days ago and I am shopping for a replacement already. Maybe I can use this one for my point and shoot camera and camcorder."
5,very great start,Napalm deaths first album wow. I am shocked the way grindcore first started out. Scum is so brutal fast and so unique. 32 minutes long but it is endless because I can listen to this all the time.
1,Anti Christian Propaganda,"This movie is clearly ANTI-CHRISTIAN: whoever the director was its obvious that forces worked through him doing an excellent job at paining Christians as dogmatic buffoons not to be taken seriously by ANYONE. And the moral of the story is - Christians are insane lunatics, the priest at the end dies of a stroke and the kid loses his faith even after seeing demonic forces in action - he chooses not to believe in God(hence embracing the devil), i.e. the Devil is the winner. This movie is WORLDLY propaganda - don't believe the hype. Jesus is the SON of God and despite attempts to try to minimize the deity of Christ his light shines through this trash movie."
3,Ok,"This movie is simply ok. Is it scary? Not exactly. Creepy parts? Yes. The best part to me was when..........basically the last part of the movie. Or maybe in the elevator. Anyway it was better than One Missed Call(2008). Better thriller/horrors--The Mist,30 days of Night,Scream, and recently, The Strangers. Better PG-13 horror/thrillers are Shutter(2008) and Prom Night(2008)."
3,An average film nothing special,"I was not expecting a lot from this movie. I don't normally like horror movies, and this to my surprise was not a horror movie. It actually had a plot. The plot is something out of an old Twilight Zone episode bizarre and suspenseful. Jessica Alba and the rest of the cast did a great job. Alba proved she's more than a pretty face and acted superbly, though the plot and script are the downside to this film. It had a nice story going but I felt it ended a little soft. It had a lot of suspense throughout and in the end that was lifted without a lot of satisfaction. I was looking forward to a twist at the end but one never materialized. It ended on a happy note and the climax was resolved without a memorable ending. The plotlines are all tied up, but overall an underachieving film that should have had a better ending. Rating C"
1,Another horrible remake,"No insult to the lovely Jessica Alba but after viewing this, she is not ready for any lead roles yet. The movie was basically generic, the acting was sub par and the movie did not have that horror movie feel to it. There was no suspense and the only frightening thing was that I purchased the movie new. The plot was thin and so was the pacing of the entire film. You don't care for any of the characters and trust me; I have been watching and collecting horror movies for years. This one stinks, badly. Hollywood needs to stop butchering Asian films. If you never seen the Ring, put this movie down and watch the Ring instead. Alba could have learned a few pointers from Mrs. Watts."
4,I can see clearly,"Jessica Alba is perfect for this superb thriller. You really feel for her plight, and by the end understand the origins of her torments. I like these kind of soul searching suspense movies as in the end they show the bright side of human nature even under a major handicap. Plus Jessica has real talent and she is easy on my eyes throughout this journey. Get this one for your collection!"
3,Entertaining but broken,"We bought this toy for our son about 3 months ago and he loves it. He plays with it all the time, so much so that you can no longer pull the tail to get music anymore. Its a bummer because he liked doing that. Everything else is still usable, but the music was a nice feature. Im a little disappointed considering how much it cost and the length of time we had it, but I would still recommend it, just keep the reciept. :-)"
1,It's ok I wish I was Conor Oberst too!,"You know when an amazing underground genre and its scene gets some attention? and then a few great bands are thrust into the spotlight? And then of course afterwards the hordes of cheap imitators come and ruin it. It happened with glam, grunge, and screamo among others, this band is a perfect example of this problem and the only way to solve it and save the genre is to stay as far away from this wanabe Sh**t as possible. Seriously the bulk of the people who listen to this loser only do because they want to have a laugh at how much he sounds like Bright Eyes, don't buy into this crap if you want funny music buy music that is made to be funny not this pathetic rip off."
3,A must have for all Hanson fans...,"Nice book, the official book to be exact by Jarrod Gollihare, personal friend of the gang (who is probably very rich!... now). Book is done on a 2nd grade level but the pictures are great & ones you have probably not seen before. The downer is that they are mostly staged & not personal shots or anything. It has quotes from the guys & some basic, non-in-depth background info. on them. The gang here noted that you could get more information from a website.. so we will give this title * * * stars :-) 2 COOL 4 School Magazine Online"
4,"This book was cool, but did not give you so much info !",But I still love Hanson !! They are the best !
1,Not a very good book,This book was highly uninformative. It had 0 information and the pictures looked like something out of a children's book.
4,A wonderful book about the greatest band HANSON,This is a great book full of wonderful information and pictures! There are a lot of great pictures of Taylor in this book. I love it. It is full of all kinds of information. If you don't have it you should go get it!!
3,"A good read, but not his best work","The Glass Key has plenty of everything we like in a Dashiell Hammett book: corrupt power and wealth, strong characters with hidden motives, deceit and double-crossing. And, in the end, the good guy solves the thing and gets the girl. So what's the problem? Well, there's just too much of it all crammed into one book. The result is a story that demands you suspend not just belief but rationality as you wind your way to the conclusion. For some people that's fine, but not for people who actually enjoy the plot development of a mystery. At some level, the story line has to be believable, and this one isn't.It isn't a bad read...in fact it works quite nicely for a wet Sunday afternoon. But it isn't great work, either. Instead, choose The Maltese Falcon or The Thin Man to see Hammett at his best."
2,"Good concept, bad execution","The device is no longer supported by the manufacturer, so when it arrived broken, there was no way to get the parts I needed. I wasn't aware that people could sell discontinued or unsupported merchandise on Amazon. It was a disappointing experience."
4,Caution - candid,"This book is not for anyone, even passionate Elton fans, who have the slightest problem with Elton's sexual orientation. This very candid book was written by an on-again, off-again friend and lover whose feelings for Elton were strong enough to withstand the ups and downs that Elton's torrid lifestyle brought with it. It is an account of excesses and tormented minds, but also of happier times and deep emotions. It is, of course, written by someone who was ultimately rejected, and you must realize that you will see everything through the author's eyes and pain. Underneath it all, you will also see the pain and suffering that Elton went through to beat addiction and end up sober. Nothing you read will take away from his musical genius, his compassion for the victims of AIDS, and his generosity towards friends and the cause of the Elton John AIDS Foundation."
3,Wiring diagram in instructions is WRONG,The connector is well made but when I followed the wiring instructions included with it my blinkers were reversed and my tailights didn't work at all. Wasted a lot of time building it only to have to take it apart and look up the PROPER wiring on the internet.
3,good book but shipping took forever,good deal on my book purchase but it seriously took 3+ weeks for my book to arrive.
2,Needs a Top Knob,The butter dish lid is so wide it is hard to grasp. A small knob like the one on top of the sugar bowl lid would be a great design improvement.
3,I'm not sure - 'twas a gift for someone else,"This was a shower gift for someone else. I hope they liked it. Maybe I'll get them to write a review for it. I know one thing - I could probably have gotten this at my local Target without paying an exorbitant amount for shipping. Way to go, Amazon."
3,Heat resistance is great,"Silicone is a great product for heat resistant spatulas. I would prefer a more squared-off design of the ""spoon"" to keep food from scorching when stirring hot items. A squared-off bottom would also make scraping from bowl or pan more efficient. The dark handle keeps food stains from showing, allowing it to look ""new"" longer since the silicone ""spoon"" sheds stains."
2,Wonderful game but its buggy problems are just too much,"This game had the potential to over take the king of action rpgs, Diablo, but it fell flat on its face.The graphics, characters (especially Seraphim and Vampiress), and game world are all terrific and a joy to play and behold... when the game doesnt lock you up or crash.Sacred was obviously rushed out the door before it was ready and it really shows. There are so many bugs, crashes, and game breaking glitches that it borders on ridiculous.If you buy this game make sure you download patch 1.6.And the next patch, 1.7, is due out in TWO MONTHS. The developers stated that the next patch will be out in June. Now if that doesnt tell you that the game needs a lot of fixing then i dont know what will..."
4,Fantastic Brain Work-Out,"I originally picked this hand-held up for a cross-country road trip to keep me occupied. Beyond keeping me busy on the trip, I now leave this handheld toilet-side. If you're a toilet book-reader like I am who feels there is an importance in maintaining a stimulated mind and pushing the envelope of what you are capable of both physically and mentally, grab it. Essentially, it's a simplified version of Brain Age for the Nintendo DS, but it will still help sharpen your mind and wake you up in the morning. A great change-up from reading. You will see results in cognitive speed and recollection if you use this just for five minutes a day.Batteries lasted about 2+ years, but the display is suffering artifacts likely due to a few falls coupled with bathroom moisture and humidity."
1,Not what I expected,I was very disappointed with this shirt. It's plain goofy and weird; if you want to look like a mad scientist Vikings fan this is the perfect attire.
1,Calling for a Re-evaluation of Ms. Roberts' message,"I think that Ms. Roberts is less than inspiring. She called 20,000 American citizens ""stupid"" on national television (David Letterman, 11/9/00, regarding the voters of Palm Beach County, FL). Is this a woman who should be giving inspiration to the masses? I think not. Ms. Roberts behavior is offensive and reprehensible. She must be called on to retract her statement. After reading the book, which was horrifically insipid at best, I cannot reccommend it. It is vain and it is not even well written. I wish that there were negative stars to give the book."
4,A Soul's December in The Wilderness,"The third world and Chicago have a lot in common. Not just the inner city Chicago or America but our innermost being.This is what Mr. Bellow takes on in a sometimes remarkable way.The sometimes similar worlds of dispare and crime in Eastern Europe and Chicago meet on the soul's battle field, fighting to give people meaning to their lives.In the end what's left? The cold dark universe or the heaven where God dwell's and ulitimately must come and save us.Mr. Bellow puts a lot on your mind and not always perfect prose, he could have left the monkey and typwriter line out of this book, but a very enjoyable read."
3,Dover's mission furniture catalogs,"While Charles Limbert is less well known than the Stickley brothers, some of his furniture was, to the European eye, even better. Sadly, the line drawings of the original catalog are extremely ugly (see nos 79 and 80 which are reproduced as photographs on the cover, you would scarcely recognise them!). I did use this to build a glazed bookcase (no 306), which must be some sort of a recommendation, for I haven't used any of the other catalogs yet. And the book is very cheap!"
4,Handy Little Whisk!!!,"This is a handy little whisk good for whipping small amounts of salad dressing, whipping cream, sauces or a couple of eggs! Nice handle, narrow design gets in the corners of a measuring cup fairly easy, no places to trap residue. Would buy this one again!"
4,"little stiff, kinda small",A little larger would have been nice and there is no give to this whisk. Good for scraping the bowl tho..
5,Contents:,"Reflects changes which have been made in DSM-III-R, notably in the areas of developmental and disruptive behavior problems.Covers mental retardation, schizophrenia and other disorders with psychotic features, behavior disorders, depression, conduct disorder, eating disorders, tic disorders, gender identity disorders, etc...case histories of above."
4,Definitely Not your typical Documentary!,"This is one quirky film. It had me puzzled at first but by the end I was laughing out loud. Yes, this is a documentary about Air's (The French band) first world tour with their album 'Moon Safari'. It contains playful interviews with the artist themselves, band members and average people on the street! The only complaint is that I just wished it contained more concert footage of the show itself. (But maybe that because I missed their tour.) All four music videos are included especially 'Kelly Watch the Stars' which sounds incredible! Overall, a fun documentary trying to capture and understand the insanity of touring."
2,Air....exactly as the title states,"This is not an exciting video to watch - quite the contrary: It's boring. It outlines the ""Moon Safari"" tour with brutal honesty - the fact that nothing really happens when you're a french duo touring with your american backup band. A lot of questions are asked by the director of the film (which makes me wonder what the focus of the movie REALLY was?) to unsuspecting passerbys (eg; ""Do you eat at McDonald's?"").I think the whole point to this film is to bore you. The two stars I give it are for the videos at the end for the spectacular track ""Sexy Boy,"" and the follow-up, ""Kelly Watch the Stars,"" which features a mix previously unreleased! The video for ""All I need"" bored me more than the 2 hours worth of documentary preceeding it."
3,Why wasn't it a DVD of a Live show???,"Why wasn't this DVD a live show??? Air are notorious for rearranging their songs live, but all we see are just JB playing the theremin and Beth singing for 2 seconds each. This documentary in itself was half-cooked. It is just that we never got to see more about Nicholas and Jean-Benoit, only edited interviews, reviews from newspapers from New York, LA and London all reporting the same thing: A french duo with the sounds of the kitschy 70s, Burt Bacharach, and bla bla bla. Yet there some hilarious scenes with their back-up band, who is Beck's band as well (Catch the rap version of All I Need.) Although the music videos are a nice add-on to the film, it is not worth the twenty dollars, unless you love to collect Air items. Hopefully Air will have some fun on their next DVD, like Björk and Daft Punk have before."
5,Perfect in every way!,I've been looking for these great walking shoes forseveral years and couldn't find them in the stores.And here they were on amazon. I may buy another pairin case they stop making them. They fit my feetperfectly with just the right amount of support and Iuse them on the treadmill and casually. Great buy!
4,walking shoe,"After looking for a long time, I came across these shoes at a price that was reasonable. Lots of cushioning on the bottom, which is what I was looking for. I use these primarily for walking or working out at the gym. They are comfortable, and true to size. I like them very much. I would recommend them."
5,Great walking shoe!,"I love, love, love these shoes! They fit perfectly and have lots of cushioned support. Excellent for walking or any other type of excercise."
3,Disappointing,"I found this a disappointing sequel and not just because I wasn't given a cameo by my favorite 18th century politico, the Duke of Newcastle, who would have fit into the book's premise beautifully.Liss does so much less than he could with the premise he chose and it points out the same problen in the first book of the series. He writes small, insular stories in which a big subject is reduced to a few fictional characters. He shows the mechanics of the election process, but, no matter how interesting they are, they don't address the true corruption of the politics of the time. Similarly, Benjamin doesn't really mix in high society he meets a few fictional upper middle class people."
2,Save Your Money,"This kettle has a number of problems, the most significant being that it doesn't whistle consistently. I wanted to purchase a whistling teakettle because, from time to time, I have put the kettle on and forgotten about it. This kettle's whistle worked less than 25 percent of the time, which renders that feature quite useless. I found the ""uplift"" handle to be awkward. It makes the kettle less stable when handling it, as the handle moves up and down to open the spout and this can happen at times when you aren't expecting it. I will say that I did get somewhat used to this, but I still never liked it. The bottom of this kettle is THIN! It did not appear to be sturdy at all. And, ironically, this thinness didn't help it heat water any faster. I replaced this kettle with the Chantal teakettle (I got mine from Amazon before they quit carrying it, but you can find it at Williams-Sonoma). It cost twice as much, but it is more than twice the quality. And the whistle always works!"
2,"nice form, mediocre function","As others have experienced, the whistle gave out after a few months; in my case cracks also appeared in the lid.Uplift handle works well and the stainless steel finish is durable--doesn't tarnish as easily as the finish on other, cheaper kettles."
2,Can't keep it clean; looks awful!,"I bought this to replace an old Oxo Good Grips kettle because after years and years, the whistle quit working. My old one was a shiny stainless and I thought for less maintenance I'd get the brushed stainless. Well... I'm neat and clean and never fry things on the stove but this thing looked awful after just a couple of weeks. The outside is covered with brown spots and gook and I can't get it off with steel wool and rubbing compound! It's odd because there was only an occasional amount of soiling on the old shiny one. I'm going to throw this out and get a new kettle. If you don't care how things look, you might like this... but I can't stand to look at this blight on my stove. A colossal waste of money."
2,No whistle,I purchased this kettle because i wanted a kettle that whistled since I've been known to forget I put the kettle on. Well it whistled great for about 2 months but has now gone silent. I was most disappointed since i have in the past had good experiences with OXO products. This kettle looks good but keep looking around if you want a whistle.
2,Rusty and Flaky!,"I probably would have given this pot 5 stars when I first bought it a little over 2 years ago. I have had no trouble with the whistle or the cover, and I like the design. This pot (ebameled metal) has been used daily. After about 6 months I noticed some rust at the spout where the water comes out. This rust area has grown. Now the inside is deteriorating. Flakes of the inside coating are coming loose and it seems to be rusting a bit inside as well. I would suggest avoiding the colored versions and going for the stainless."
1,"Good overall design, whistle fails","I purchased one of these kettles a couple of years ago and generally like it, especially the spout that opens automatically when you pour. However the whistle is not durable. I sent my first two back to OXO due to the whistle failing. They graciously replaced the units with new ones, the second of which had a new design for the whistle. However, it too failed within a couple of months. I have followed the directions of not filling the kettle with too much water and only using medium heat to no avail.I have an electric stove so I have not had the handle-heating problem that others have mentioned.I cannot recommend this kettle as I feel it is dangerous to not have the whistle function properly."
1,Everything the naysayers say about this SS kettle- is true,"Just to confirm;If you have a nice stainless steel kitchen and a good stove with a big flame, avoid this kettle.If you put the flame on high, so you can boil water quickly (duh) it licks around the bottom and melts the edge of the whistle, killing it.The handle gets too hot after water is boiling more than a couple of minutes.( maybe if the whistle still worked...)Also if you reheat to bring water back to the boil.In all fairness, my mother has the same kettle in porcelain, on a stove with 3-4 inch burners. In that setting, it's fine.PS Don't go for the Kitchen Aid Kettle. It's even worse."
3,Not sure I'd buy again,"We wanted a kettle that wouldn't burn our hands everytime we used it, as our old Chantal kettle did. Well, this Oxo accomplished that, but when they say use over medium heat, they mean it. When the kettle sat on our gas range with the heat slightly higher than medium, the plastic around the whistle mechanism melted. This is not what I expected from a $50.00 kettle. Also the whistle is so high pitched it has all the charm of stone scratched over slate. Don't know if I would buy this again.Picky in the Kitchen"
1,2 only,"i only got two in the mail shows four on order, dont know what happen to the other 2. maybe misinformed."
3,No US ground,"It worked fine, but there wasn't a US ground, so I could only use plugs without a ground."
1,Does not accept 3-pronged US plugs,"This thing is pretty useless to anyone from the US, using this abroad. The adapter does not accept any US plugs that have a 3rd anchor prong on it. So you won't be able to plug them in at all. It will work fine for plugs that only have 2 prongs. But, for me, not being able to plug in my laptop makes this a total fail."
1,Crap,This thing is crap. Fuse blew 1st time I tried to use it. Couldn't find a fuse for it til I returned to the US. Found a cheap adapter in a London luggage shop which worked perfectly. Skip this one.
1,Fuse pops all the time,"Nice idea; slick item. But, the fuse pops all the time (very normal / basic use like charging a laptop). Unfortunately, this makes this adapter completely unreliable and useless. You do not want to find yourself in a foreign country having to look for a replacement fuse..."
3,Just An Okay Product,"Generally disappointed with this item. The adapter functions as advertised, but has a very ""cheap"" and ""fragile"" feel to it. The adapter plugs can be difficult to extend/retract. It's also a bit bulky. I think you can save space/weight by just bringing individual adapter prongs instead of packing this unit."
2,"Low power only,",This adapter is very convenient but won't work with hair dryers or medium to heavy power users. It has a 2.5 amp fuse. I plugged a hair dryer into it and the fuse blew immediately. That is it can only handle up to 275 watts at most.
4,Worked well in UK but US ground pin different shape,"This adapter worked well in all areas of travel throughout the UK. However, as mentioned in other reviews, when plugging a 3-pin US plug into the back of the adapter, the round grounding pin of the US plug doesn't fit into the rectangular hole of the adapter. Having read several reviews which confirmed that this problem could be circumvented with some effort, I purchased the product. It required significant effort to plug in/unplug my US plug the first time used; with subsequent uses the plastic cover adopted a rounder shape, although it remains a struggle.I hope that the manufacturer's address what appears to be a design flaw."
2,Sturdy product but does not fit all,"I bought this travel plug adapter for my wife when she was traveling to Europe and Asia. However, it does not have the input for the 3-pin U.S. plug and had to get another adapter to fit onto this unit. It is well built but definitely not a universal, all-in-one travel adapter as advertised."
5,Have visited 140 countries. This works in 98% of them and also accepts three prong grounded plugs!,"I travel for the US government and to say that I am a road warrior is putting it mildly. I have used this adapter in many countries on every continent and it is an extremely RARE occurrence when it won't fit into an outlet. I have also noticed many reviews claiming that this adapter cannot be used with a three-prong grounded plug. Funny, since I am typing this review on my laptop that uses three prongs and is plugged into this Kensington adapter. Maybe those that complain should look closer. This road warrior recommends this product most highly. It is one of the best purchases I have ever made!"
3,Good Camera (I think)--poor customer service,"I got some good results while learning to use the camera. The noise issue referred to in other reviews wouldn't bother me, because I rarely take low light photos.Unfortunately, after about 150 pictures, the camera stopped working. I received an error message after taking a picture. I called Sony customer service. After 45 minutes and a couple of contacts, no one had heard of the error message (odd that they would program an error message and then not tell support people what it means). I had to return the camera to Sony for repairs, at my expense....with a 7-10 business day turnaround. Maybe I've been spoiled by quick turn arounds (and free shipping) by Apple, Dell, HP, and others, but that seems a little long."
5,great improvement on the maxxum line,I have been using Minolta Cameras for over 15 years now. When I finally decided to switch from Film to Digital I hated to start over with a new camera line. The main reason was all the lenses I had accumulated over the years. I seriously considered the Maxxum 5D & 7D models but was reluctant since Minolta was selling out. So I decided to wait on the Sony Alpha Body. After receiving the camera I played around with it using just the auto settings. I found that most of my images were badly underexposed doing this indoors. Outdoors things went great. I also found the foccus sensors to be a bit sensitive but after using the camera for awhile I quickly adjusted to it. Overall I think it is a great camera. From a technical standpoint I think it compares evenly with comparable cameras. I think for a minolta user it is a great step up from previous models. All and All if you are looking for a solid mid range digital SLR this would be a great camera for you.
1,Get this material elsewhere,"I own one of the old ""From Elvis in Memphis"" CDs with fairly poor audio quality, and purchased this CD as an upgrade. This CD is a travesty. Everything is remixed, and while the technical audio quality far outclasses my old CD, it also strips away horn sections, bass lines, and more importantly, all the power and emotion from the original. While my lousy old CD version would accompany me to the desert island, this CD would be the first thing I'd toss overboard if my boat was sinking. You owe yourself this material, but get it elsewhere."
4,Christmas gift,"A friend requested these as a Christmas gift and a group of us got together and bought virtually all that he has written, even his older books are still relevant today. Shipped Fast, great condition, exactly as promised. give this seller an A+"
4,Excellent for short-term pain relief,"This product is wonderful for temporary short-term pain relief, just spray and rub. If you are suffering for an extended period of time then you should see a medical professional."
4,Quality Information,"That is what is contained in this book. He discussed all topics which he covers in his handling classes. It's an excellent stand alone, or in conjunction with his seminars. Highly recommended for all handlers, beginner or experienced."
2,He may be an excellent handler but he is not a writer!,"I couldn't believe how many times he belittled the ""owner-handler"" in this book. He seems to think that ONLY professional handlers are the ones who deserve to win because they spend an incomprehensible amount of time training and grooming their dogs. It is a sport, get real and have fun, most people have real jobs during the day. He also liked to write about what ""the judge likes"" and how to hide faults instead of commenting on what is the most important aspect, the dog itself. I have found other handling books to be much less judgemental and more professionally written. He needed to keep a lot less ""go-pro-handler"" emotion out of the book and stay away from writing about all his experiences dealing with ""owner-handlers"" (one time, in Ohio...)"
2,This is the best Rhino could do?!,"I sort of suckered myself into buying this setonly to have greatly regretted it upon receiving.You see, I am a collector of music. I have thousandsof CDs in my music library. My biggest passion concernsthe collection of compilation CDs dedicated to a particulardecade.Rhino has always been known to put out some of the bestcompilations available on the market.Upon receiving this 90s boxed set, I was absolutelydumbfounded by how much crap was included in this set.While each of us have different music tastes, it is quiteobvious that this is certainly not an accurate depictionof the 90s decade.What this looks like instead is a few choice hits thatmake up 10% of the set, and 90% second-tier music thatwas probably the only thing available that Rhino was ableto obtain licenses to carry.I would not reccomend this set to anyone."
2,Whatever? No...not really...,"Call me crazy, which many of you will, but is this compilation really indicitive of the 90's? Where's the angst??Yes, there are many obscure songs on this set. And yes, it's great they they found non-mainstream music to include. However, when attempting to encapsilate an entire decade, shouldn't you also include mostly popular music, showing the trends and forms of the decades?While some of the bigger artists were included (like M.C. Hammer and Oasis) what happened to the surprise artists like Alanis, No Doubt and Whitney Houston?Overall, I think this set was a big waste of time. I spent most of my years in High School as a music freak, and the years before and after that I collected, listened and studied all genres.Perhaps I should just release my Ipod playlists, with better 90's collections, and more thoughtfullness involved?"
3,Something in the Way...,"Great compillation, capturing the full sound of the 90s, including all the retrospectively embarrassing stuff we all used to swear by! Just one problem... there's nothing here by the most notorious band of the 1990s: Nirvana. I don't understand how Tad, Mudhoney, L7 and Bikini Kill are all collected here, without the presence of the band that got these bands commercial recognition to begin with!Not even ""Smells Like Teen Spirit?"" Come On!"
3,"This book was half funny, half ridiculous..","Gibson Walker was appalled when Chloe Madsen came to work for him. he's only agree to employ her as a favor-- he had no time to babysit an innocent small town girl. So why was he finding himself tormented by Chloe's shy beauty-- and infuriated that she didnt even notice him?Chloe didnt dare notice Gib. She was already engaged, and only in NY for the summer. besides, Gibson walker was exactly the sort of man mothers warn their daughters about: sinfully gorgeous and determinedly single!this is a fun read, but dont expect it to be one of your favorites. i enjoyed reading this book but this is the type of book that i wouldnt read twice. I found some of what's happening absurb and the guy wasnt up to my standard for an ideal hero. Gibson was conceited.. too sure of himself.. he was ridiculous! i didnt really feel that he cares for the heroine."
5,great album,this is probably my favorite vu record. the band's songs are more melodic and less experimental noiscapes that characterized the content of their first two records. the modern lover's first album is very influenced by the vu music recorded in this era. i like the vu's music from this period.
4,(3.5 stars) The first six songs would've been welcome on any VU album,"The last four, not so much. It's too bad that the Velvets were dropped from their label while working on their aborted fourth album, since half of this (which collects that material) and half of Loaded could've easily been VU's best effort. Take rockers I Can't Stand It and Foggy Notion (with great guitar from Sterling Morrison, an underrated guitarist), add a couple of lovely ballads (Lisa Says; She's My Best Friend; Stephanie Says; the Ocean), and you've got pure gold, right? Side two isn't as good: Andy's Chest is goofy, but better heard on Lou Reed's Transformer album; I'm Sticking with You is a half-serious sendup that veers dangerously close to self-parody; Temptation Inside Your Heart is weak; One of These Days is too. But the best songs on this disc make it a near must-have."
4,I've enjoyed this series,"I've enjoyed this series. If you're a fan, then get it...it's not easy to find this in rental stores if you want to watch it later."
2,save yoour money,"this just another movie, that people make so that the other terrible movies still look good. save your money"
1,Tabs are very cheap,"The flip-up tabs on one the days came right off after my 3rd time flipping it up. Replaceable, right? Wrong, that's assuming the company responds to your (politely written, I might add) request to replace one of the sections. They never did. So, this review not only deals with the cheapness of their product, but also they're lack of customer service."
2,design fault,"While it's truly large and has big capacity in each compartment everyone of them is very hard to open and I must push the side to lift the closing cap, it makes thaking the pills a real hellish action and if I could I'd exchange it immediately with something as big but with easier caps to open, however I don't trust the buying of another large capacity pills organizer because it's impossible to tell by looking at the picture if there's going to be any issue with it."
2,Flimsy,"I bake but not so much that I put a hand blender through any serious paces. This worked well enough and it was easy to grip BUT it is flimsy. Even with the limited use I made of it (once a month) the plastic holding the wires BROKE. There is no way to fix the cheap plastic and it is useless.Really, it was not a good value for the sturdiness required for an occasional baker of biscuits as myself."
2,"Comfortable to use, but not functional","Nice handle design, but that's about as much as I can say for this pastry knife. The wire blades are too flexible, so they tend to bend around butter/shortening instead of cutting it. If you want something that works, buy a pastry knife with blades that are cut from a solid piece of metal, instead of individual wires."
3,OK but too flexible,The ribs are just too bendy for my taste. I use cold butter and lard so I need something that won't slip around the edges of the fat instead of cutting through it. I always used two criss-crossed butter knives and don't find that this works as well. I'd prefer the similarly shaped nut chopper to this.
1,worst buy. waste of money,i brought this at bb&B; and this is one of the worst kitchen toolthe wires bent all different angels and don't do the cutting of butter into the flour as fast as the other ones.don't waste your money on this.
5,Why Doesn't Anyone Like This Movie?,"I love this movie.Sure,it has some foul language and some sexuality content.But it's just updated.My favorite character is Tanner.Even though I'm nothing like him.Except the language.I talk like him all the time."
2,Cant understand...,"Watching this movie, I had hopes that I would be able to let my 10 year old watch this one....no chance!!! This movie is vulgar to the point of ridiculousness. Every other word is a cuss word, and it takes away from the whole meaning of the film. People wonder why and where thier kids get the language...it is not at school anymore...it is at your local theater!! Terrible...could have been a fun loving comedy, instead it ended up being a movie that should have been rated R..for raunchy!!"
5,best movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i went to see the movie,and went to see it again! get this movie!"
3,Quite Amusing For A Movie That Has Been Done So Many Times Before.,The new remake of Bad News Bears featuring Billy Bob Thornton was not bad at all. Billy Bob plays Bad Santa playing an ex professional ball player playing a coach of a little league team (watch the movie and that will make sense). The movie illicited a few chuckles and the story didnt really take any major turns from the original. They definetly pushed the limit of taste with some of the jokes which made it a little more amusing. Overall this wasnt a bad movie but it wasnt a great one either. Its a good popcorn munching movie but if your looking for a whole lot of substance your in the wrong place.
3,Served its purpose,"I bought these for my 8-year-old son, who has autism. He loves to draw roads with telephone poles lining the streets but often gets frustrated if they aren't perfectly even on the left and right sides. So I showed him to draw his streets and houses and then place the poles on the sides of the drawing instead of trying to draw them and getting frustrated when they weren't right. They are perfect for that but for everyday play I'm not sure they're durable enough. In my opinion they are to be placed and left....looked at but not played with. No problems, none of them have broken or bent out of shape. They serve the purpose for which I purchased them quite nicely."
2,"Only ""HALF"" the fun as they make it sound.","This is the worst mary-kate and ashley game ever!The only easy things on it,is Earth Day Atv mini game,and triva mini game!Its stupid how when your driving,you only make like 2 turns and the police says""a ticket for bad driving"",theres no way possible to get past a C on it! i got an A on Earth day,cause it was easy! And don't get your hopes up,about the rock climbing,cause it isn't any rock climbing.I have girls night out too! and thats even Lameo! your done with the game in like 6 hours straight,or like in 3 days.I give this product 2 stars,one for the trivia,and one for the Earth Day game."
1,Nothin good about this cd!,Don't offend Rachel Bolan on myspace or he'll comment back and then block you from defending yourself! He's really an a*s hole and Skid Row is a has been.If you want something that rocks get Angel Down from Sebastian. Don't waste your time or money on this new lineup. I have the cd and wished I didn't!
4,Definetely Different,I read the Not sure what to think review and agree with a lot of it. I can't tell any major difference in the bonus track and would of preferred a re-recording or a live recording of a original Skid Row song instead like on Thickskin. Johnny Solinger is a great singer and the music is still Skid Row. Dispite the bad reviews Scotty and Dave still shred. I agree there's a lot more punk vibe on this record but the first album had it too. I think the country songs were just showing their sense of humor. At least half the songs are that solid Skid Row groove. The haters need to get over it. I mean have you heard the music Sebastian Bach has put out since he left? Or the condtion of his voice? If he was still around you would be writing What happened to Skid Row? This is a case where the singer IS NOT!! the band. I believe their next disc will really shine.
2,Skid Row??? UGH...,"Whatever happened to the sound that made this band what they are? ""Dick in the System"" is a decent tune..but the rest of this CD sounds like it wants to go country which, for a metal fan such as myself, is pretty frightening! If you want to experience a really good CD from this band, buy ""Thickskin""."
1,caveat emptor,"It might be remastered but the sound quality is a dull thud. I have a CD of Lou Reed performing on a local raido station many years ago. Transformer was due for release. It sound many times better than this ""ORIGINAL RECORDING REMASTERED."""
1,"Please people, this is junk!","There is just about zero talent displayed anywhere on this steaming pile of crap! Come on...classic? You mean like the rock equivalent of Ed Wood's ""Orgy Of The Dead""?"
1,Can't I give no star?,This miserable album has got to be the biggest catastrophe anyone could waste their money on. I am serious. This is simply the worst cd I have ever heard in my life!
3,Its Ok,"There is really only a couple of good songs on this one but it was worth a listen..not many complaints, just have to be a follower of VU to get it.."
3,An Alternative to Boring Commentaries,"A unique and helpful way to study the New Testament's Sermon on the Mount. If nothing else, it gives us Martin Luther's pastoral thoughts on the sermon in an engaging format. Those looking for a more technical analysis of the Sermon on the Mount will not find their time best sent in this work - although it is a great devotional read."
3,A case of inflation,"Laughlin is of interest to historians of publishing and those old enough to remember him and New Directions- even if its list was irritating. The Way it wasn't is an inviting title, but the book is grossly over-produced:printed on heavy art paper, too much white space amongst the blocks of self-conscious typography. Thepersonality exposed by the book is like his list: a mixture of shrewdness, self-indulgence and vanity. Probablynot the best memorial."
1,Talentless Hacks,"I received this album (on vinyl) in a stack of records cast off by a friend. It sat around for 15 years, and I finally played it. I hadn't up till now due to the artist name I'd never heard of, and the rather ghoulish look of the artists on the album cover.I don't know who this kind of music appeals to, but it's amateurish, has no rhythm, no hook, no groove, limp whiny vocals, etc. It sounds like a couple of talentless hacks randomly plinking and moaning ""da-da-da-da-da"" in their garage. I see that T.Rex has produced several albums, so they must have found an audience somewhere for this dreck. Me, I'm baffled."
4,Talented voice,"Karrin Allyson is one talented singer. Anyone who can sing jazz in three different languages is to be commended. I have to say the ""O Pato (The Duck)"" is the best song on the CD. I plan to indoctrinate my kids into jazz in the future by singing this with them! She can scat pretty well, and handle romantic french/portugese songs with class."
4,Quite a Talent!,"Singing in French, Portuguese, Brazilian, Italian--even a little English!--Karrin Allyson has produced a delightfully entertaining vocal CD that maintains maximum musical coherency despite its multiplicity of languages. Her background musicians play with taste and style (special praise goes to Gil Goldstein, whose contributions on accordion add significant seasoning to the musical flavors), the recording is clean and clear, and the music is interesting to the utmost. Allyson's brief but helpful liner notes set the stage for the songs, whose composers range from Jacques Brel to Caetano Veloso to Bud Powell to Ivan Lins and others. This is truly an engaging and rewarding CD; fans of female jazz singers would be well advised to add Karrin Allyson to their list of singers to audition. She's quite a talent!"
2,"Great material, poor design","I have been playing racquetball and wearing racquetball gloves for 30 years. This glove's material is as grippy as I have ever experienced. However, the seam design and seam cut on this glove is TERRIBLE. If you look at the second image on Amazon's entry for this product, you will see that the thumb piece for this glove has a seam that comes to a point in the upper left of the picture, just above where one's thumb meets the palm. This is a natural pressure point when holding a racquet. My skin ripped away at that point within 20 minute of my first match. Later I was able to carefully trim the excess fabric along the seam, so that now the rubbing is merely slightly painful rather than skin-ripping.It is possible that this problem was caused solely by the sewing and is specific to the glove I received rather than the entire model, but it turned what would have been a 5-star glove into a 2-star glove."
1,Save your money,"This movies is SO BAD, my true rating would be 5 black holes. It looks like it ought to be good--John Landis, the actors, but trust me, this would have to get way better to become merely BAD. Think three stooges, with PMS and guns. I got this because I am an Adrian Paul fan; I know some film work is better than none, but if you too are a fan, save your money and watch some old Highlander episodes. This actually hurt to watch."
1,Disappointed,"I have been in the carpentry business for 30 years and have never been as disappointed in a American tool as this one. First off the unit is huge, it has a handle but won't stand up on its back legs,it gets hot and has no easy place to grab it to put it in the truck, it is the noiseist compressor i have ever used. The on off switch is all but hidden, the cord wrap is useless, the wheels and axel vibrete and rattle, even the stickers are falling off already. The reason the front plate comes off is because it is twice as heavy and nosy as it should be. PC makes good tools but I don't like this one. Bob Meanix"
1,Coarse design,"When I received this one, the real scraper looked coarsely designed. Especially the gripe, which is so wide and thick. So I return it.My advice is pls read the info about the product more carefully before you make mind to buy it."
5,Everyone who cooks should have one.,Why I didn't get this item before is beyond me.I have limited preparation space and the Good Grips Pasry Scraper is a time saver.Never realized how easy to put a meal together could be.I reccommend this product to anyone who has to chop food and add to other items being prepared.
5,Great tool.,This is a pro tool. High quality is evident. It even has a measurement etched into the bottom edge.
1,Rusted need I say more,"I was so excited to get this product, I know it doesn't take much to get me excited but then I put it in the dishwasher and ugh pulled it out and it is rusted and I can't get it off. Not happy in the least, used it twice, will never order another one of these again."
4,OXO Pastry Scraper,"The pastry scraper works for pastry as well as working for breads also, multifunction. It does what it says and does it well and it didn't cut me like some have. Enough said."
4,Straightforward Utility Utensil,"When I bought this I thought I would primarily use it for chopping. Instead, I use it more after chopping with the knife to quickly and efffectviely transfer things from the cutting board to the pan. It can certainly chops many things but it is not a substitute for a knife. It is also solidly made. Good utility tool but if you only have money for a good knife, get that."
3,Useful!!,"I used to use something like this all the time when I worked in a deli, but I find it useful at home all the time. It's great as a pastry cutter and helps get veggies from cutting board to cooking vessel in bulk. I haven't tried chopping anything with but maybe for bread or pizza dough it could be pretty good.The handle is a little wide / awkward to use tho, I think it would have been better if it was a little taller and thinner then so short and round. I think it's just personal preference tho."
4,Great product,"We bought this product a couple of years ago and just down I'm getting to writing a review.After much use, I love this product. It's nice and hefty and it feels like quality. It's more than just a pastry scraper. It has a sharpen enough edge that we used it to cut dough, tortillas/Quesadillas and other things. it's so handy and easy to handle.We have enough gadgets but this is one gadget that we use often."
3,Delivered quickly,Served the purpose when I couldn't find them anywhere else. Got some compliments from those who saw the result. Good service.
4,Xtreme ? Try Grandia 2 1/2,"I've been well awaiting the arrival of this game. Now that it is in my possesion I must say that I'm truely satisfied. If you liked the fighting from Grandia II, you'll be pleased at the the improved battle system.{Took me a lil while 2 figure it out but now that I understand everything, I must say they did improve it} Ah, but you must give to recieve. In this case, you give up a deep story for a better battle system. The story {though enjoyable} is pretty simple. Theres also not much moving around. There's 2 towns. Only one of any real use. The rest of the time you're going through dungeons. All said and done, the game is truely fun. It met my expectations since I wasn't expecting 2 much of a story. If you're a fan of Grandia and loves to fight and level up, this is for you. If want to a deep story you should wait for Grandia III."
2,Boring!,"In this day and age there is no excuse for such a pathetic attempt at an rpg. The storyline is horrible, with the worst dialogue ever. This game is little better than a dungeon crawl. The game drops you in the middle of a tedious story line with all your characters already there. There is little attempt to give them any sort of individuality and the main character is so irritating that you prefer the main villain. I regret spending 40+ hours on this game. I kept thinking that it would improve, but it doesn't. The only redeeming aspect of this game is that it has the best fighting dynamics out there. But if that's the case, I would recommend playing some of the other Grandia games. I give it two stars just because of the fighting engine, but it's still not worth playing."
4,The Third Grandia,"This game is the third installment of the popular RPG Grandia series, a series known for its great epic storylines, interesting characters, and its amazing battle system. Apparently this game has a much deeper focus on combat, and it has you hacking through eight huge dungeons.There is a story, about how the star character Evann must find the case of an elemental disturbance, but the storyline probably won't come anywhere close to Grandia 2's.That said, this battle system is quite possibly the best I, an avid RPG fan, have ever seen, Xtreme will be fantastic. I'm still buying it though I will mourn the loss of the storyline. If you like the Grandia series and/or sick of the prolonged story sequences in games like the Final Fantasy series, wanting to get down to kicking some monster's ... , go for it. The game should be great."
5,My favorite kreator.,Speed/technical/thrash and even a lil grind which started it all. Kreator is by far ? My biggest influence in metal todate.Make sure you also get kreator's other albums aswell! If you don't own this then you not a real metalhead... That's all i've to say.
4,Good Gun Case for an OK Price,"This case seems well made and should hold up for many years of use. I like the large side pocket so I can carry along my full size Remington 28"" barrel in a gun sock while my 870 Express is fitted with my 20"" deer barrel. And, there's still room for some ammo and a few accessories.I would give it 5 stars except that it was priced a bit high, came in only one color and had no sling for shoulder carry (a nice to have option)."
1,What you'll get is not the item pictured!,"The item pictured is not what I received like the previous reviewer - it's blue, not yellow - and it is not a 'Every Which Way Dust Mop refill' - it's a microfiber dust mop refill that 'fits Every-which-way' dust mops. Big difference. It's smaller, not as full - save your money and buy elsewhere, bad selling tactic."
2,not happy,"by looking at the picture this what i thought i was buying, well i recieved a blue one, the (strings ) are thicker not the fine looking ones like in the picture. i have been looking for this replacement ever where.I guess i will just keep looking. The replacement i recieved i could of just went to walmart and bought the same thing, not very happy with what i bought."
5,Good old-fashioned product,Love this for cleaning hard-wood floors. Stirs up much less dust than broom sweeping. Lots cheaper than mops (Swiffer) with the disposable cover that you have to replace each time.Does a great job of gathering the dust bunnies and pet hair. Works well on steps. Shake outside after each use. Our previous refill lasted more than 10 years.Keeps our floors shiny without scratching.
3,Catholic customs for homeschool,"This book is very elementary. It would be good for pre-K to early first. It is easy to follow and has some good activities, but many of them are for classroom use. It's okay, and I will use it, but I think I would have done better to google particular feast days and find activities that were more appropriate and make my own binder."
5,Practical guide to treating each other better.,"Telushkin has a distinguished record as an encyclopedist. This book is more ambitious in that it integrates his source material into a coherent thesis: that words are powerful ways in which we can hurt each other if we are not careful. One of his most useful insights is in illustrating how even true information can be used as a weapon. On a macro level, his advice would be welcome in the public arena. On a micro level, this book should be read by every parent and every lover and friend. Sticks and stones can break your bones, and words can sting for years if we don't use them wisely."
5,No problems to report,"Ok, cmon now. It's a whisk and works well. I own MANY oxo products and am pleased with almost all their products. They all perform their function well and with style. And they are also very comfortable to use thanks to the famous oxo nonslip rubber handle. Seems very sturdily made and have had absolutley no problems. I would hihgly reccommend."
3,its okay,"my fiance' likes it better than i do, but it will walk you through the simple steps. if your first starting out, dont get confused by what they are showing you, it may seem odd, but it does lead to something"
5,Wow!,"Awesome ""old"" book, the pre-curser to the Boy Scout Handbook. Fun to see all the things boys could actually do when it was written, too bad they can't do a lot of them any more. Antiquated view of girls and their capabilities, however."

3,A frivolous attempt at originality.,"This is probably my second-least favorite album (ALTERNATIVE being my least favorite.) I've had this CD for over a year now, and I still wonder why I haven't gotten rid of it. It's by far, the most overrated of all PSB's albums, and very unmeaningful, talentless, and flavorless. I wish PSB never released this album, and I think that this CD is indicative that they are losing their talent in producing quality music. I recommend this album to nobody, except a bored boy, cause this album is very...BOOORING..."
2,The Pet Shop Boys have done better than this.,"Sorry, but I was quite disappointed with this album. I was expecting something as rich and deep as ""Behaviour"". But what came out was something (in my point of view) as basic and poorly written as a rave-dance-track. The lyrics are 2nd rate, the rhymes are laughable and the (beautiful) music (they used to write) was overcame by dance beats, latin beats, even Bossa Nova-like beats. ""Discoteca"" and ""Single"" are mindless tracks that keep repeating themselves. ""Electricity"" is as boring and dull as ""Up Against It"". ""It Always comes as a Surprise"" is an easy melody helped by a likable bossa nova mood. I guess only ""Survivors"", ""Before"" and ""Saturday Night Forever"" actually keep this album afloat. But barely. Try their older albums instead!"
5,great,"AS good as usual, like every Platinum Millennium release this title never ceases to amaze me and i am surprised that so few people know about this book. The package is great, you cannot find a better one anywhere else"
4,Best Blower for the Price,"Was the cheapest way to get a gas blower. Already had gotten the Poulan Pro gas weed eater and the edger attachment, this attachment finished off my lawn care needs. It isn't the best blower, but it gets the job done and that with the price, it can't be beat."
4,Trends in history,"Iggers examines basic trends in how history is written. The book looks at how social sciences transformed historiography after WWII. Iggers describes a trend in the postmodern discipline towards a microhistory, cultural history as well as the history of the common man. An interesting read."
4,Real!!!,"I liked this type a lot because it seemed as if I was in an actual gym,working-out with regular people. Having people who are not models, made the whole routine fun and real. Being a Billy Blanks fan, it was also nice to have a small presentation at the begining of the tape. He explains a bit about his career and how he's found something wonderfully inspiring in his life. The work-out is not so vigerous, but you will still get a nice even work-out. Since, it's not a long session, I find that I can combine this tape with one of his others. Anyhow, it's worth adding to your Billy Blank's collection."
4,worth a look and listen despite negatives,"The positive attributes of this DVD: Verdi's composition is marvellous, its a constant stream of glorious and tuneful music. The orchestral playing under Chailly is terrific. He is a superb Verdi conductor and his pacing and phrasing is unerring. In my opinion he is the star of the show. The singing and acting is generally very acceptable although Amanda Roocroft is somewhat lacking in vocal power. The recorded sound is warm and clear. The 4 act version is relatively short.The negatives: The production, cheaply devised in a dreary and opressive grey, leaves much to be desired. But compared to a lot of the more intrusive rubbish emanating from European opera houses nowadays, it could have been worse! Try concentrate on the music and stage action. Villazon, while in excellent voice, tends to overact; at times his gesticulations reminded me of Rowan Atkinson.On balance I enjoyed this performance and recommend it with the reservations mentioned above."
2,Different?,"Lets see what I could say about this cd. Well... It was umm... Different?I listened to Shaggy when he was still on the radio when he had hits like Angel and It wasn't me. Then I bought this CD, and it wasn't like that. Shaggy seems to be one of these artists that are fading out and will soon be a ""who?"" I think he made more money from selling the songs on this to the movie industry than from his fans, but don't quote me!"
5,"Worth Its Weight In Gold! Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!","I am a super Shaggy fan. I am, most often, not disappointed with his work.This CD was released in 2002, but because it is so well done, it is dateless.This is an excellent CD. It has dance, thought-provoking, romantic and just-chillin' tracks. If you are a Shaggy fan, you will like this one.Some of the tracks would please almost anyone. Chaka Khan is the lead voice on one of the dance tracks and she gets the job done, well. Track eight (8) ""Lost"" featuring Prince Mydas is over-the-top good.Adding this one to your music, CD collection will not be a mistake."
3,could be better...,"While I love the compartmentalizing feature of this type of medicine tray, the individual cases fall out of the tray really easily, and knock all of the others over. I might just be a little clumsy, but having a way to snap each compartment into place would make this a perfect product."
2,Came damaged but is also cheap,"I was disappointed with this product. The tab is broken on one of the days, which makes it very hard to open. Also, the lid won't stay closed on another day. Plus, the trays don't click into the stand, they just kind of rest inside it and slip out very easily. I am returning this item."
5,Nice Pill Box Caddy Thing,The pill boxes are well designed and the only complaint is that the boxes don't snap into the stand but just rest there in slots. Not too big of a deal but snapping into place would have been better for me. At the same time it may have been a pain if it snapped into place too securely so maybe its just me. All in all a great purchase.UPDATE 7/18/12: Its actually better that they don't snap into place. Works just great as is and a great product.
4,Pill box set,"The product was as described. After using the pill boxes, I found them inconvenient in removing the pills. In order to remove them, it is necessary to upend the box, and that causes both dosages to come out, when I want only one. Vendor was good, but the product design was lacking."
5,apex pocket med pack,"My friend had looked everywhere for this specific type of pill box, to replace the ones her parents had. Of course, I found them on Amazon, where I always find just what I'm looking for. I don't waste time with other shopping sites anymore, if you can't find it on Amazon, it doesn't exist!"
3,NOT CHILD PROOF,"I really wanted to love these because I take medication twice a day and it's important that I not overdose myself and also important that I not forget if I've taken it already. Often I found myself worried I hadn't taken it because I couldn't remember if I had or not. We have a two year old (thus the forgetful mommy brain stuff) and I needed a good solution for remembering pills everyday. I was so disappointed to find that these are not child proof. If I have to put these away and totally out of reach and out of sight -- I'll forget to take my medication! I don't see why they couldn't make a childproof version. I suppose they're marketing to older individuals who may have a hard time opening the boxes. However, older folks also have grandchildren or little ones around their homes and it seems to me they should be able to come up with a solution to meet both needs. Oh well. This will be given away to a charitable donation group for someone in a child-free home to use."
1,7-day med tray,"This was purchsed for an elderly Aunt. The exterior of these individual pill boxes is too slippery; she was unable to hold them and return to the tray. Also, I bought the item because I thought the box lid was separated so that AM and PM could be opened individually. That is not the case; it's in one piece. When when opened, the meds could accidentally be spilled into another section. Great concept but needs some modifications."
5,Great Product,"This product turned out better than I expected. It is very convenient to use, very portable and organized. It keeps all my medications at my fingertips and in the proper quantities. I really like it."
3,"Really convenient, but not well-constructed","I love the idea of these. They're a great size and close tightly so that I can carry my vitamins with me in my purse. But I have to rate them a 3/5 because the first time I touched one of the packs the little piece of plastic used to open the pack broke off. The very first time, and I barely touched it! Probably more sturdy ones out there."
4,worth the wait,What can I say - this CD rocks. Make sure you see these muthers live - it's always a stone gett-off! Yeah!
5,There was Kraftwerk and then ...Severed Heads,"This is one of the best Sevs albums but that is a hard call with Gigapus, the Laptop Pop Series and Haul Ass also excellent. Tom Ellard, who is Severed Heads, has developed a unique sound since he produced the late 70s early 80s set of casettes under the Terse Tapes moniker. The hightlight for me is the Bad Times Three track included on some versions of this release. It makes you wish there really was a volume 11 on your stereo. Big Car, Greater Reward, Triangle Tangle Tango (try saying that fast) are all wonderful. The first two are remixed on ""Retread"". Start here and then get all the rest. And don't forget to check out the weird and wonderful Coklacoma featuring Ellard and Fifth Way Militia from Utah. Truly unique and original music. An extraordinary ""band"" with an equally extraordinary catalogue of music. There are maybe a dozen bands in the whole world who sound like no-one else. This is one of them."
3,metal too soft,it was crooked so i tried to bend it cuz it's soft metal and the fingertip segment broke off on one side. it's fine it still stays attached mostly and still looks neat.
3,"Plasitc whisk, not pleased","When i received this whisk in the mail i was excited until i pulled the bag off and i realized the base of the whisk was plastic and it was all bent out of shape looked like it had been stepped on, doesn't work very well to mix unless its for something light like mixing liquids not good for batter."
2,Flimsy,"This item is very disappointing it is so flimsy that it is unusable. Can’t even beat eggs with it, it bends at each stroke…Had to buy another one."
3,Flimsy,"All we had was a metal whisk and every time we used it, it tore up our nonstick pans. I figured I would give this a shot for under $10. Handle is comfortable, the unit is dishwasher safe. However the whisk portion is somewhat flimsy. We have been able to mix everything except cold pancake batter. It was a little too thick and I switched to the metal. However thick gravy, soup bases, etc all have held up. I can't complain for the price, but just expect a bit of flex in the whisk unit."
1,I must have been possessed to buy this,"Maybe I would have liked these guys if I had heard them when they first arrived on the metal scene, but hearing them now...WOW these guys were bad! I will give them credit, they were one of starters of the Death/Black Metal movement but that doesn't necessarily make them good. Even with the CD remastered it sounds terrible. The original production was just horendous. Plus the lyrics and guitar playing is terrible! Not to mention the vocals. Even for Death Metal vocals these are bad. I see these guys made a second album, but after hearing this monstrosity I think I will pass on it. There is MUCH better metal out there."
5,A CLASSIC IS RE-RELEASED!!!,"After an initial run on cd back in the late 80's, that eventually went out of print, Possessed's ""7 Churches"" has arrived! With Relativity Records finally rereleasing this ground breaking mid 80's metal cd, thrash fans of a new generation can hear what true thrash was all about. Featuring an all out, face ripping attack and strange syncopated drumming, this cd was copied far and wide after its original release in '86. ""Burning In Hell"", ""The Exorcist (with the cool Tubular Bells intro)"" and ""Death Metal"" are a few of the shredding songs that are available remastered and with full lyrics. Acidic vocals and weird tremolo bar soloing are other features to listen for on this awesome metal classic."
1,Absolutly terrible production!,"Out of all the albums that I have heard, this is one of the worst when it comes to production. It literally sounds like they hung up a mike in their rehersal room! It sounds terrible! If somehow you can get though the ransid production, then you find out that the band has no real talent. Sorry Possessed fans (the few of you out there), but there is much better material out there than this. Poor lyrics, poor riffs, and poor guitar playing! Yes you read right! Possessed is talentless and only got notieced for a VERY short time because of their evil image. I'm not buying into it and intelligent listeners shouldn't either. Go listen to Testament, old Metallica, Megadeth, etc, anything but this. There is no enjoyment on this album. You can't even feed off of the aggression like on Slayer albums. I'm glad Possessed is dead. These guys gave metal a bad name."
2,Pages missing,"Very dissapointed in the Dover editions. There's always something wrong.In this case it skips pages: from 54 it jumps to 200+ and after 30-40 pages in the 200 range it goes back to 86. It's very frustrating when you are trying to study the score.2 star not 1 because layout is very clear, medium-big print. Nice pages."
5,Great game,"We love this game my 4 year old got it for Christmas and has already played through the whole game twice. It has lots of neat gadgets. It is fairly easy and nonfrustrating for younger children. My only concern is that it might not be challenging enough for older kids. We really like that the games are nonviolent your weapons are water balloons, hamburgers, etc... We plan to buy more Jimmy Neutron games in the future."
3,"A few good Jerks songs , but thats it","This was the first album with the new lineup , and it's a disappointment. They kinda went a cheesy 80's direction with this. However songs like ""The Crowd"" , ""Mrs.Jones"" , and ""Making The Bombs"" stand out as being really great Jerk's songs. Overall it's a bit lousy. But buy it for those three songs."
1,Hassan's Review - Get another Translation,"I do not think the man who ""translated"" the Koran here is a true Muslim. One cannot shuffle and reorder the Suras to suit one's own taste. This man does not have the right to mess up our Holy Book in this way. Plue the style of writing is not nearly as engaging as the Ali version. I have not been in a Mosque yet that had this version of the Koran on its shelves. You can go into any Mosque in this country and pick up a copy of the Ali Tranlation for free. Why waste your money on this Infidel sham version?"
2,truly awful transaltion!,"Now, regarding the Quran and other scriptures, you know from the start it's going to be a slow read. Writers like Mohammed, St Paul, and others were not word-savvy and couldn't make a gripping read like Ian Fleming, JK Rowling, or Jean Auel. Nor did they care: their mission was to ""speak God's word"" not to entertain their converts.Nevertheless, when I picked up this book, I soon realized that even Mohammed was better with words than this. He was, after all, an Arab, and the Arabs has long cherished the word as art (hence their beautiful calligraphy and poetry). But this book was beyond dry. Even though I was prepared for repetitious narrative, like that in the Bible, I seriously felt like I was reading a telephone book. It totally killed my appreciation for the book, even though I love studying the religous classics. I immediately dropped it and went for a better translation."
3,A good dose of Ice,"Although Barbershop is somewhat controvesial, I did enjoy it. Calvin, played by Ice Cube was a typical brotha just trying to make it somewhere, and somehow. His family owned Barbershop was more of a nuisance than a dream for him. A lot of knowledge sitting here mixed with humor it was a good movie especially with Ice Cube in the lead he's come full circle baby! Plus it was made in THE CHI PEOPLE....................."
4,FUNNY AND WITTY,"A BARBERSHOP OWNER [ICE CUBE] SELLS HIS BARBERSHOP, WHICH USED TO BELONG TO HIS DAD, TO A LOAN SHARK [KEITH DAVID]. BUT LATER, HE REGRETS IT AND HE TRYS TO BUY BACK HIS BARBERSHOP. VERY HILLARIOUS AND VERY WITTY. WAS CONTROVERSIAL WHEN RELEASED 2 YEARS AGO DUE TO SOME JOKES ABOUT SUCH IMPORTANT BLACK HISTORICAL PEOPLE LIKE ROSA PARKS AND MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. CEDRIC THE ENTERTAINER STEALS THE SHOW IN THIS MOVIE AS THE ELDERLY BARBER, EDDIE. I DEFINITELY RECCOMEND THIS MOVIE TO ALL COMEDY FANS. IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH THE TIME AND THE MONEY. FOLLOWED BY A SEQUEL."
4,Great product I feel safe with my 1.5 year old in a bed!,"Got this for my 1.5 year old as she is now in a twin bed. Great product except for the side rails for the bed frame cover up my use of the hideaway rail. Perhaps if I had it on top of a box spring it would work better. However it keeps her in at night. Thought I would need extra long rail, this is definitely long enough!"
3,Cover is weak link,Overall this is a good product and functions well. The weak link is the cover. It is slightly too small to fit over the frame and the nylon zipper broke on both of the bed rails we purchased. Being cheap nylon zippers they cannot be repaired.
2,Zipper broke,"The zipper is like a piece of tinfoil which broke as soon as I started trying it. The mesh fits tight which you want in this type of product but the cheap zipper portion makes it useless, I feel cheated that I bought two of these. The reviews sounded good so I gave it a try."
1,WARNING: Incorrect Picture,"I just received this item and wanted to warn other shoppers. The main picture is NOT the product you are ordering. It is a picture of the extra-long bed rail. The subsequent pictures are of the shorter, 43"" bed rail but the main photo is not."
1,Could Not Put Together,Two of us with advanced degrees cannot figure out how to put this together and its been over an hour. And we watched a youtube video on how to put it together. DO NOT BOTHER! This is ridiculous!!!
2,good if you don't want to fold down often,This bed rail is definitely secure and does not leave a gap between the mattress and rail and it does slide away easily under the mattress. We have a trundle bed frame and we have no problems sliding it under. The one difficult thing is that it is so hard to fold it down...the buttons are very hard to push in and to get back in place. We usually just leave it up for that reason. I'm not sure how this compares to others.
3,"Works Okay, gets stuck alot","This product is better than some, but it constantly gets jammed when sifting cake mixes. Kind of flusterating. You can only put 1/3 of what it actually holds to get it to work."
4,OXO Shaking Flour Sifter,"Another awesome product from OXO! Very ergonomic. Heavier gage mesh than pictured. Should last for the rest of MY life! Thanks Grandma, but the mesh wore out on your old one!!! Wish it had a handle on the side like Grandma's old one. The shaking can be a bit cumbersome for those that have a problem with repeatative motion difficulty."
1,Big disappointment!!,"I used my new sifter yesterday for the first time. What a disappointment! It was extremely slow to sift 1 2/3 cup of flour, taking about 4 minutes. The side to side, shaking motion was tiring, so much so that I had to move the sifter to the other hand. I was surprised at that as I think I have strong hands and wrists, typing a lot and being a keyboard musician.I quickly ran downstairs to the trash and retrieved my old, reliable and fast crank-style sifter. I'll try the new one again but suspect it will end up in a garage sale!!"
1,"Too Slow, falls apart","If you are sifting a small amount and a fine powder, it is ok. But, to sift 2 c flour it takes forever. And don't ever try to sift brown sugar, it gunks-up. Also, the handle keeps coming-off of the sifter mechanism. Don't waste your money or time."
5,Great!,"I bought this for my mother last year for Christmas, upon her request. She has Arthritis and needed a sifter, and she loves this one! A lot of times you will get a sifter that won't sift well, or that is hard to use. Not this one! Easy to use and reliable! I highly recommend this sifter."
1,Looks a lot better than it works...............,"This phone won a lot of design awards, which is great if you are buying it to look at but if you need a good phone this is not it. It started doing funky stuff right from day one. The ringer gets ""stuck"" on on the handsets and can't be stopped without removing the batteries (not an easy task as they are really hard to open). For service you have an email address and an 800 number. I tried both 3 times and got NO RESPONSE!. I would not recommend this phone to anyone. Thankfully Amazon stands behind what they sell and took it back."
5,Everyone wants to try it,"The Grand Strumstick is a beautiful instrument, easy to play like the instructions promise, and portable. It's a real conversation starter...usually I'll get, ""Can I try?"""
5,Difficult to stop listening to this,"One of Rainbow's best albums, every track is great, especially with the awesome SHM. Must have for any CD collection, but don't pay these ridiculous over-inflated rip off prices. I purchased mine from The Music Specialist on E Bay, save yourself a ton of cash!"
1,...no cure in sight...,"ritchie helped to rock and bluesify deep purple...he turned fantasy into fact with rainbow...the dio years...then bonnett came to own...not bad, just different...then ritchie turned on the radio one day and said...'hey...i wanna be like all the other garbage their playing now...'and so begat rainbow, the joe turner years...this album is not a rainbow album...this is a 'jefferson starship/asia/genesis' hybrid of leftovers trying to be the soup of the day...'down to earth' was where the rainbow faded...this was where the rainbow died..."
3,Power To The Duck At Last,"The only fun I got out of this game was picking Daffy and beating the ... out of Bugs Bunny. Besides that, it's not fun at all."
5,LOVE this bracelet,This bracelet is beautiful! I love wolves and this is just what I wanted. The detail of the wolf is perfect and I love the cuff style. I would defently recommend this bracelet for anyone who loves wolves. Beautiful craftsmanship! The pewter does bend easily but the detail and crafts-ship of the wolf is worth the carefulness you have to take in bend the bracelet on and off.
3,Virtuality: The New World,"The author presents a tour of cyberspace. During this journey, we learn how the author feels, and what their priorities are. Cyber communites are the logical extension of chat sites, and web/ mail exchanges. In the real world, where restrictions can be placed on our daily lives, virtual reality provides an escape. Exploring this venue, we can learn more about ourselves as we interact with others, and the new environment. I'm glad the author documented their experiences!"
4,Provides a good sense of online communities,"The book is indeed a page turner. Online life and community presents opportunities and problems that are similar, yet different than RL. Julian's account was very subjective, but he opened himself up sharing the experience and the results on his RL relationships. If you accept that MOO users controlled what he experienced while online, then Julian could only report the experience. If his experience was so controlled, then it does support the Power Elite theory. I was fascinated."
3,"The words change, but the song remains the same","Disclaimer: I was never a player in LambdaMOO, but I was a player and a wizard in some other games at approximately the time in virtual history described by this book. Although I didn't know any of the pseudonymous MOOers in _My Tiny Life_, I nevertheless felt right at home in Julian's LambdaMOO, because the people and the situations were so familiar.Ah, yes, I remember it well. This is certainly not a perfect book, and probably not as good a discussion of the issues of cyberlaw as Bruce Serling's wonderful _The Hacker Crackdown_, but it was a lively read and I thought it captured the lived experience of being a member of a virtual community. But I am recommending this book to all those folks from my own MUSH days with whom I am still in touch. Dibbell really captured the flavor, at least for me. Oh, and hey, Julian - real women NEVER @desc their shoes. You can always tell."
1,Very bad quality,"It's not DVD quality it's just VHS Videos on DVD. Awful quality of sound, bad quality of picture. I don't advice this product."
4,pretty good,"this is a good CD....nice, upbeat, and inspirational. The best tracks on this album are ""Bring It all back"" and ""Two in a Million"". Bring it all back is good because it offers encouraging words to those who are having problems believing in themselves. Two in a Million is good because it is about having someone in your life, who means so much to you, so much that you believe that you and that other person are just 'Two in a Million' with how good your relationship is. This is a great CD with quality pop songs, for the most part anyway. The last few tracks are kinda like filler songs, not very good, but for the most part the album is great for any pop music fan."
4,SClub7 CD,"While Sclub7 is not profound music, I prefer this over the breathy sexual sound of Brittany Spears. For younger children, 7 - 10 it is up beat and fun. There are a couple of good songs with lyrics that are decent and offer inspiration. My children enjoy the funny antics of their group. It's light hearted and I don't find myself trying to explain the lyrics or hidden meanings. It is not mozart - I recommend it based on what it is meant to be fun, light and very dancable."
4,S Club 7 is Excellent!,"This is one of the best albums I've ever bought. So many of their songs are upbeat, but traditionally, you have some slow ones. The one complaint I have about S Club 7 is that their voics aren't fully matured yet, and also some of their lyrics are a little corny. But otherwise, this CD is something you'll want to listen to a lot. This is a very lively group and their songs are really different than what you'll mostly hear today, like Britney Spears, or all rap. And that gets old. S Club 7 is just what the music world needs! Plus, I'd like to see Britney get her own show."
1,Education of A Speculator by Victor Niederhoffer,"I don't know what it is, but I can't get into this book at all. I've read tons of investing books as I am a financial reporter at a nationally distributed financial/investment newspaper. I feel there's a lot of rambling without a lot of cohesion in his ideas."
1,My worst book investment till now,"If you expect something like Pit Bull, Reminiscences of a stock operator, market wizards (I&II), Trader vic, Investment Quotient etc etc, you will be worse off than even disappointed. This book takes you to anywhere but successful investment and trading. Talking about trading and investment there are plenty of good ones out there for you to pick instead of wasting your time and money on this. I dont understand how some reviewers say it's a must for the traders or investors. Quite the opposite, as a professional trader, this one is excellent to sell short."
4,The year in Provence of trading and speculation.,"The unified theory of trading with a touch of a yearin Provence. Vickie's draw's from all the fields of natureamusing parallels and developes an intuitive tradingmethodology. Brilliantly explains the trading arenaand its contestants, and the similarities to other naturalsystems allowing market participants to understand theirlink in the ""food chain"". Dr. Neiderhoffer's book isinsighful and one can not help respect his intellect,primarily because it enriches and humbles us the readers .Moreover,his ideas are poweful in that they transcendto other life activities.Joseph Dirnfeldjdirnfeld@aol.com"
3,The Education of a Reader...,"If you are looking for great insight or help on trading orinvesting, you won't find it in The Education of Speculator.It is an entertaining book, but definitely not educational.Victor Niederhoffer provides his history plus the history ofhis family interwoven with a few bits of market strategyand techniques. If you enjoy reading about what life experiences compels a man to speculate in the markets, readhis book. If you want to learn to speculate, don't withhis book."
1,What an ego!,"If he's such a hot-shot, why does he have the time to write a book? Shouldn't he be trading"
1,The Education of a Speculator,"A cynical guy gets the last laugh on us all - after all, we bought the book! Writing this autobiography helped Victor satisfy his personal, emotional needs but not many of this reader's needs for investing insight."
3,Are the Patterns in Financial Markets Quantifiable?,As far as I am concerned the most important message of this book could be squeezed to a single sentence: See if you can QUANTIFY trading ideas you might have. There is a lot of fluff and self-gratification in the book but if you can grasp the importance of that single thesis and make use of it in your practical speculation that'll pay you back far beyond the price you paid for this book. Pursuing a stock speculation idea that is not quantifiable can be as futile as looking for a black cat in a dark room especially when the cat is not there.
1,Updike is a Hack,"Updike? a great American writer? Please. The man couldn't write his way out of a paper bag. He has no diction, his prose is frightful, and he certainly isn't going to convert anyone with Rabbit Run, a pitiful waste of paper, as pretentious as it is creepy. What we have here is another sob story of a man who needs to grow up instead of playing basketball all the time. He's not going to make the N.B.A. So why doesn't he put down the ball? Updike's entire novel centers around this question, trying to make the case that just because Rabbit is no good at basketball doesn't mean he shouldn't play. Please. I suggest Moby Dick, this is pretentious trash."
1,Terrible,"If you want to read a terribly depressing story that has a plot which goes nowhere, read this book. If not, stay away. This was an easy read but hard to finish book. If it had not been a gift I would not have finished it."
1,how did this guy get considered as a good author?,This guy must have some connections to have made such a name for himself. I defy anybody to read this book and not come away thinking that the writing is EXTREMELY amatuerish. This prose does not flow as one person mentioned (...). i would rate it lower but one star is the lowest amazon goes.
5,Indispensable Guide,"We purchased this book in preparation for a drive from Pennsylvania to Florida. Are we glad we got it! We used this book the entire trip to locate restaurants, gas stations, etc. Even the location of the local speed traps were correct! We discovered several great attractions which we otherwise would have missed out on if we had not purchased this great book. Very highly recommended for your next trip on I-95!"
2,Where's Florida,"We drive I-95 from NY to Florida about four times a year. We use mostly our GPS for speed and routes. I also have and use the ""I-95 Exit Information Guide"" (from Maine to Florida)which is a great book and it sits right next to me. This ""Drive I-95"" was very disappointing to me. The information in it is seven years old, (2005) (3rd. addition) It excludes Maine of Florida and it omits most of Massachusetts, Exits 13 to 60 So its not a true I-95 guide. Its designed to read ""UP THE PAGE"" divided into two different sections driving North or South. which is not normal and is confusing. The center part is the only good part. It reads like a history lesson that makes good reading. (2 stars) I will take it with me for bedtime reading. Too bad the edition outdated."
5,Best Buy,This takes out the guess work and kept everyone quite during the long car ride. It was better then I excpected.
3,Drive I 95,"Haven't had time to actually use this book so far but my sisters. one of whom has used an older version of this book in the past, used theirs recently while traveling north. They found it very helpful in locating places to eat and stay overnight. We did notice however that one or two of the eating places in our own area of Santee are no longer in business.I hope to get my chance to use it shortly."
5,By far the best Guitar DVD I've ever seen,"For an lazy intermediate player, this is a quick way to learn great songs. I just wish there were more of them."
4,Big Red Fun,"A fun read for ankle biters of all sizes. Even the smallest of children will enjoy reading, and reading, and reading this classic compilation of trouble for the big red dog in his early years."
5,The MK Series Fires Back!,"This new Mortal Kombat is no walk in the park. TO play this game you have to practice with each character in order to adapt to the new fighting styles. To make a long story short and sweet, Deadly Allince is not for the faint of heart or the sissies. With tons of blood and gruesome fatalities, this game is a sure hit."
4,Greatest X-Box Ever Played and Best Mortal Kombat!,"This game is definitely a 5-star, two thumb up game! With new characters and old. Johnny Cage is back. Liu Kang is gone after killed by Shang Tsung and Quan Chi, a new villain to the Mortal Kombat world. There is a lot of blood but HEY.... It is rated M for Mature and it's Mortal Kombat. There a new moves, combos, fatalities, and you can even impale your opponent with certain people that have swords. Get it. It rocks!!!!"
5,simply awesome,"I bought this game as it was walked into the store by the u.p.s man. Ive been a big fan since the first game when my mom wouldnt let me play it. I would have to say that this game brings home the series. Although they could have done better on the fatalitys, some are so lame but some are awesome also, its about 50, 50, But that isnt that bad, the game play is awesome and the krypt was a real good idea. I enjoyed having to earn the extra players and to also see stuff that i never have before about the past games. Its a must have for any mortal kombat fan or fighting game fan. Plainly awesome."
2,Mortal flaws in the gameplay.,"Nice graphics and action packed! Too bad they messed it up with a stupid combo system... In order to unlock all characters, you have to complete 'Konquest' mode - this means you will have to do combo's etc. But some of the 3-style combo attacks are nearly impossible to pull off. I've been playing beat'em ups from day one and I found myself struggling with Raiden's combo for half an hour!! Honestly, I felt like performing a fatality on the disc.The gameplay is also very tedious. If -for once- you opponent DOESN'T block your attacks, you would be stupid not to use your best combo. So you find yourself performing the same tricks over and over again. The game also gets ridiculously hard after a number of consecutive wins, even on medium mode."
3,A matter of opinion,"I picked this book up at the library, and found it interesting, but not spectacular. Some very creative ideas and novel techniques; especially how to make millefiori beads from polymer clay. I'd say I would actually make and wear about 50% of the items."
1,Extreme something,"Some folks need only a paper-thin plot to string together a bunch of action sequences, without character or theme or language or logic getting in the way. If that's you, this may be your movie. Xtreme sports, xtreme ops. Get it? If that doesn't strike you as xtremely clever, you may find this movie painful to watch. I'm thinking of telling The Agony Booth about it.The humor doesn't work, to the extent that I think I want a laugh track after all. Or a drummer doing rim shots. Ba-DUM-bum! Characters are distinguishable by such things as fake national accent and stereotyped mannerisms, hair style and/or color, or shouting all his dialogue. I didn't watch it all. I didn't even watch enough to tell you what it's about. Amazon or Imdb can tell you what it's about. Just something else we found in the flat. Someone's losing credibility as a selector of DVDs."
3,Way over priced for cheap plastic!,"My girls received this castle as a gift and love playing with it; but I was disappointed in the durability and sloppy sticker job that some one in the factory put on. They were all crooked and some were wrinkled. The whole castle is very flimsy and I only hope that it will last for years of enjoyment. For the price I would have expected better quality, durability and better decal assembly. Way over priced and should be priced for 50 dollars. Girls love it though and have a lot of fun."
3,"Pretty good, but Thompson has done much better","Any fan will want this in the collection, if for no other reason than the concert staples it contains (""When the Spell is Broken"", ""She Twists the Knife Again"", ""Ghosts in the Wind""). There are plenty of other fine songs here, as well, but I find the overall sound of this album to be a bit flat and tired (perhaps this is why RT switched producers after this one). Most of these songs just don't grab me the way Thompson's best stuff does.The quality of RT's large catalog has set the bar very high, so while this album is certainly good, in the context of Thompson's other work it rates as only average. I would recommend ""Hand of Kindnes"", ""Mock Tudor"", ""Shoot Out The Lights"" or ""Pour Down Like Silver"", among others, far ahead of this one."
2,Disappointing variety of Ridgebacks in the U.S.,I felt this book was very superficial regarding recent (last ten years) of RR breeding in the U.S. I was really disappointed not to see more of the great dogs and great breeders of the last ten years in the US.
1,Ektelon Classic Pro Racquetball Glove,"My glove didn't last longer. It started wearing withing 4-5 days of play. Glove's end near the wrist worn our first.All in all i am not happy with the quality of the product.Regards,Advait"
1,Holds my boxer for about 20 minutes,"I purchased this crate after reading the reviews and had some high hopes. I was tired of coming home only to find my living room destroyed from my 1.5 year old boxer. After putting her (50 lbs) in the crate for less than 1 hour, I came home to find that she was able to bend the crates' wiring at will and easily escape. It is being held together with zip ties now (after two days of use!). I would not recommend this product for any large/strong dog. Very disappointed."
1,Intec 3-D Sound System for PS-2 PlayStation,"While styled nicely to match the PlayStation PS-2 game unit, the Intec system is a POOR performer. Cheap, plastic ""dimestore"" construction of speakers and components are first on the list, while tinny and somewhat LIMITED volume and audio are next. Only 3 controls on the front (volume, bass, and surround on/off) leave VERY little control over the audio.The subwoofer ""breaks up"" at anything above half-volume, and has NO real bass effect. The surround sound is more like an enhanced ""spacial effect"" rather than true surround. Speaker cords are WAY short of adequate to allow any true surround placement.Treble and high-end audio is uncontrolled and unpleasant (""shrill"")to listen to over a long period of gameplay.This item LOOKS like it costs about $25 to make...Avoid it !!(unless you have no care about GOOD audio for your gaming...)"
3,Falls near the end of my top ten,"Vangelis did OK with this one. I did like very much the vocals (That is the only instrument outside of synthesizer here). It's not an infinitely playable album, because so much uncomfortable emotion is expressed. However, Movement six, once you get to it, is well worth the wait and very tension releasing. It reminds me of coming home from a long day at work. Another piece of art by Vangelis, though one of his more unusual."
2,"Great story, but skip this edition","This review covers only the Gateway Movie Classics edition, softcover, 1999.What a thrill to revisit this gripping story that I enjoyed in childhood so much. Good writing, excellent story-telling, if you're not too squeamish to tolerate late 19th century colonialist literature.But skip this edition. Mainly because of the numerous typos scattered inanely through the book...periods dropped into the middle of sentences, rogue exclamation points, and words inaccurately transcribed as though an original text had been OCR scanned without any professional quality checking. Inexusable in a professional publication. And, frankly, I don't think the movie is all that great, so the cover photo of a film version Quatermain doesn't do much for me.Get another edition!"
4,A timeless author,"Ryder Haggard stories have a timeless aspect to them. They are page turner adventures. King Solomon's Mines and She are among his best. Their believable characters, well sketched by the author, draw the reader into the action. The book is difficult to set aside."
4,nice book to read.,"i've read this book because it was requirement to read it in my columbia reading class. i didn't feel that it was difficult book to read. but when the professor taught us about post-colonialism and talked about the background with the work of guns, germs, and steel, it was reall hard to understand. anyway..... in MY opinion, it was very interesting to read this book."
5,A Diamond with many facets,"King Solomon's Mines is one of the best adventures ever penned. Even the Victorian-English-speak dialogue adds to the realism. A lost brother, a great treasure, an exiled black king, a pitched battle, heroes, death, a vast and dangerous wilderness, a doomed love, strong friendships, one of the strangest and most evil villainesses in all of literature, and echoes of antiquity -- what more could you want? You could want literary excellence, wonderful pace, and a slight element of the occult. Well, Haggard provides those as well. The films VERY loosely based upon this great tale are horrible. This is a dream. Go read it. Unfold Da Silvestre's fragile treasure map and take the unforgettable journey that is King Solomon's Mines."
1,WORST prep book ever made,"This book has the LEAST amount of study reviews among which the information given in the book may even mislead the test preparers.As many have already mentioned, this book has so many typos and misinterpretation of the problems/answers.Do not make yourself another helpless victim, and avoid this book, period. I have heavily relied on test-prep books since the SATs, PSATs, GRE, and now ASTB, and I tell you, this book is the WORST I have ever studied with."
2,Not as Helpful as it could be,"Very basic book, not a large section for what I wanted. There are much better study guides out there to use."
1,Set up for failure!,"Cliff notes should be ashamed. Mistakes in one of their literature guides for someones book report is one thing. Mistakes in this test prep where someones career and ultimately their lifes goals are on the line, unexceptable!"
3,At last on DVD but what happened to the negative?,"This is one of those atmospheric horror films churned out from AIP during the 60's heyday which made its way to late night TV. It has had a fascinating history being culled from numerous sources and creative hands. (Video Watchdog magazine had an excellent multipart chronology on its making.)That being said, why on earth did Madacy not transfer a complete version of this film to DVD? The rights were available on VHS from Sinister Cinema distributor and that version is complete.How can the DVD be missing chunks of original footage that was available even on tv? They need to recall the current crop and rerelease it correctly. Dream on.The film itself is not great or best of vampire films, but it had a dark mood and some chilling scenes that mixed eroticism with suspense. Don't look too closely for the plot and the overall feel of the film does crawl under your skin. I recommend Dementia 13 for folks who like this flick."
4,Still good...but,"I ordered this cd, and had to pay $50 for it. I was disappointed when it came and I found out that the second disc was a Live performance...which would have been fine, but they had parts during the performance where they had the fans singing along. I didn't pay to hear the fans singing. However, the item is still good...in it's own way, so I only took 1 star away. My absolute favorite McFly song, ""Obviously"" was one of the songs that they had the fans singing. I would still recommend the cd to anyone who is a fan, but if you don't have a lot of money to spend, hold off for a while."
5,Deep Down Slide Guitar from the Soul,I first heard Lucille on The Last of the Mississipi Jukes cd (She's also in the movie of the sames name). What a great voice and she plays some of the best gut wrenching slide guitar on this planet. Lucille is the real deal and a MUST for any serious deep down home blues fan.
5,Elegant Crystal ball,I have purchased many of these crystals and have given many of them to friends and family. They love the colors as the sun catches each one of the facets!
5,Love these prisms,We have two of these hanging in our east facing window and it's lovely to open the curtains in the morning and see the colors.
1,No!!!!,"Worst book ever written. Run for the hills! Run away! Upon reading, anticipate headaches. Upon finishing--if ever (and you are a god if you do)--the polar ice caps would have melted and you'd be just alive enough to realize you no longer have friends. Live a little..."
1,Avoid OCR Copies!!,"Obviously this said somewhere in the fine print while I was ordering but this is a so called OCR copy of the book. What this means is the book has no index, no table of contents or the preliminary pages, no major/visible chapter headings or pages diving chapters. Its one continuous long string of text from the first page to the last. I had no idea that I was ordering an OCR copy when I placed the order and so receiving it was an absolute disappointment. While I am going to return this book right away it is a warning to all future buyers to carefully check if their orders are an OCR copy. Amazon should place information about the book being an OCR copy upfront rather than below where the book description is."
4,great video,I think this is great for seniors that are not as active. I bought it for my dad and I tried it and its a good beginners guide.
4,"Easy to Follow and is Perfect for Folks Who Can't do Regular, Active Yoga","I liked how the DVD was broken down into several parts - each using a different way of doing yoga - chair, lying down or standing. I have a number of problem areas which keeps me out of a typical yoga studio. My personal yoga instructor suggested I try this DVD for times when we couldn't meet for our session and I found it met my needs. It's perfect if you can only do chair yoga, or only do yoga lying down, etc. A good purchase."
4,Fine novel from a great western storyteller,"Louis L'Amour often wrote novels of men whose strength of character was their best redeeming quality although they were handy with guns and were rough and tough when it mattered. Rafe Caradec's promise to a dying man kicks off this tale that begins on a ship and plays out in Wyoming amid lawless men and unfriendly Indians. The story has touches of romance and plenty of shootouts and fistfights, and as usual, the bad guys get what's coming to them. Caradec does seem to good to be true but the tale is a good read and ranks as one of his best western yarns."
3,The strory is great and very interesting,"This story is excellent and very intresting some parts, although there is a vague description of the lamas monastery . the beginng of the book is very compelling but towards the middle the speed of the book decreases greatly. the characters have very intresting mind sets. as the secrets of shangri-la reveal the book becomes very fun to read. i would definately reccomend you read this."
5,VERY GOOD BOOK,"A book that takes you away to a utopian way of life in Tibet. Recommended to me by an eccentric old gentleman in the Bahamas, this book delves into a culture and way of life many of us would like to experience at least for a little while.A good book for vacation."
1,Felt like School,"A member of my book club chose this as our book to read this month. It is a short book, but it took me forever to get through it. It's not hard to read, but it is terribly boring. I finally trudged through it. The last 2 chapters were the best, most interesting for me. It leaves the reader wondering what happens to the characters. It felt like a book I would have to read for school and write a report, or have a discussion about it.The other members of my club seemed to like it o.k., but I couldn't bring myself to stir up any happy feelings for it. It felt like school. I'll leave it at that."
4,Shangrila Revisited,This is a classic novel from the 1930's. It was very popular at the time and sparked a movie of the same name. It was to a large extent America's introduction to Tibet. Interestingly it presaged our current concerns about global destruction resulting from unbridled greed and lust for power.I enjoyed the 1930's terms and attitudes and at the same time see not much has changed. It's a good read.
3,Easy reading,A plane is kidnapped and its passengers end up in lamasery in Tibet. The rest is what you may expect: some of the characters want to remain there (after some spiritual insights) and others want to resume their urban lives. The end is open and you have to imagine what happened.
3,"An odd little book, really","Though this books seems to have acheived ""classic"" status, I'm not sure it necessarily belongs there. I was pleasantly surprised by some of the ideas and a little amazed by Hilton's seeming to predict the concept of (though not in so many words) nuclear war a good 15 or so years before Hiroshima.As a period piece it was charming, but it was so sparse in its style that it left me wanting more and didn't so much end as just kind of fade away."
4,a fun quick read,"This was a great summer read. It goes quick, i keeps your attention, and its just good fun. The suspense definitely boils as the plot unfolds which truely makes it hard to lay this one down. Although a bit dated, i found it to be very well constructed. A good story, interesting characters, and alot of mystery. Simply put, one of the better classic adventure tales i have had the pleasure of reading. Highly recommended if your not looking to for something to deep."
2,Not Fun,This game is not much fun. I wouldn't recommend it. The rest of my family didn't like it either. There are 3 ways to answer the questions but only one way really works.
5,"Loved every gothic, supernatural, nazi minute of it","I loved the movie and wanted to see how different the book was. I was not disappointed. I felt the movie captured the spirit of the book quite well. I loved getting to know the characters better and Paul's writing style is descriptive without being wordy. If you like gothic horror, the supernatural, stories involving nazis and the occult you will love this book."
5,Amazing!,I love Paul Wilson and I love this book. It's a classic and I plan on reading it again. So much mood and atmosphere. Love it!
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A few key elements to an entertaining story are here. An old darkfortress, a bunch of ratzi soldiers, and some vampire type monsters. Nota lot more you could ask for in a horror tale of this type.What would you expect when you fortress is a castle in theTransylvanian mountains? Unsurprisingly, the commander starts to seehis troop numbers decrease."
3,"A good read, expected more though.","A friend of mine suggested The Keep and mentioned that it was a horror classic. The Keep takes place in Romania during WWII where German Troops occupy a Keep for use as a lookout point.The troops discover a hidden room and when that room was opened it unleashed a horrible entity which starts to kill the troops.It is a good book, but honestly, I expected more out of a ""horror classic"". I did enjoy it, it had an alright ending and it reads fairly fast. Like I said though, I expected something more from the Keep. Perhaps it just did not live up to the expecations I had previously placed on it.If you want a decend read, then definately read the Keep."
1,Worst book I read all year....,"Buoyed by the praise garnered for this book ... I purchased this book with reasonably high hopes. However, it turns out that the best part of the book was in the imagining. Unfortunately, the story is dull, populated with cardboard characters, and instead of building to a satisfying denouement, the book cranks along on rusty gears, until it slowly and thankfully eases to a halt.From this purchase onward, I have learnt to read...reviews from the ""Lowest rating first"" What a pity I can't set that choice as my default."
5,the bad popes,"a well written book, a great read for those interested in history, especially those drawn to the history of rome."
2,Not as education as the old versions,"The older models of this toy used to show a child not only how to put the pieces on, but in the larger to smallest order. This product does not do that due to a straight shaft.I did like the duability of this product (my son is 23 months and although he never used this a lot, it's still in good working order).My son, did however, like the lights when he was around 5-6 months of age but that can be obtained in other products."
3,Get a regular stacker instead,"This toy is amusing for my child, but I've found that the first thing she did was realize there are two buttons on the top that cause all the lights and music - she doesn't try to stack the rings, she just keeps hitting the buttons to get the music. The stacker looks pretty with the rings on, but when the rings are off, the white light is a little too bright for my taste. If you want an educational toy, get a regular non-musical stacker instead and if you want a musical toy, I'm sure there are ones on the market that do more than have just 2 buttons and play songs, but this does not encourage the child to learn how to stack the rings."
4,One of my 8 month old's favorites,This is a new version of a classic stacker toy. My baby has had it since she was 2 months old and has continued to play with it. It's somewhat of an old stand by but I'm glad it still interests her.
1,Too many closeup of open mouths,"I was disappointed in this film, mainly because of the excessive number and length of the closeups on the conductors' faces. Also, it would have been helpful to know who was conducting which orchestra. One can guess, I suppose, by the language the conductor uses to address the musicians. It was interesting to see each conductor's rehearsal technique and to learn more about their attraction to Mahler's music. But I found the closeups distracting, and it spoiled the film for me."
1,yuck,"another movie that presents mathematicians as socially inept and mentally unbalanced.as a student and teacher of mathematics, the greats I've met were quite the opposite. they are the most balanced in the crowd. they're the most congenial and the most fun-loving at the university staff parties.movies which present the unbalanced genius go hand-in-hand with the notion that everyone needs a slight personality disorder or a bit of ADD or ADHD or dyslexia .... come on, people! these are signs that you have too much white matter and not enough grey matter to think it through or to focus."
3,heavy heavy heavy drama and yea heavier drama than expected,"Sir Anthony Hopkins truely saved this movie, the scences which he is in (and it is not a lot) truely made the movie. Paltrow's betrayal of the daughter suffering from the same disease in which ravished her father was good(not oscar worthy, but good none the less). WHy is it that Hollywood only betrays SMART people with mental illness, such as Russell Crowe's performance in A BEautiful MInd, and Nicole Kidman's performance as the severely depressed and haunted poet in THe Hours. Depression is not a disease that just the educated get. Although Paltrow can play the queen of depression with her performance as Sylvia Path in the movie self titled Sylvia. Good acting just too heavy of a drama for my taste."
2,maybe the play was better,this movie is terrible.....I gave it two stars because I always love Anthony Hopkins and Gwyneth Paltrow isn't too bad either....The rest is a shamble of a movie. The premise is ridiculous so right there you have to either love the actors in it or you have to love the idea of the story. I went with the actors. Don't waste your money or your time on this. I've seen superior movies with this acting outfit.
2,Proof that good actors and good acting = bad movie,"What is this movie about, really? Is it like the Amazon reviewer says, ""advanced academia, revelations of love, fear, regret, and potential recovery""? Maybe, but I don't think so. This film deliberately toys with its audience so we can't get a fix on whether Catherine is crazy or sane, skittish or companionable, a liar or a saint, brilliant or dull. At the end we find out, but we're given a lot of false scents until then. So maybe it works as a kind of academia thriller, but for me the thrill was gone.To me it seems the story is more about the challenges and ethical issues surrounding the care of ill parents. How much should children be expected to sacrifice to provide a ""dignified"" life for their parents? But this story falls far short of answering that question, too."
4,a undearable tragedy of being......,"""I didn't find it, i wrote it.""i mean.. how can it be more desperate?! in the middle of talent, love, insanity and trust, this film is full of humanity and emotion, the director of ""Shakespare in Love"", John Madden, once again bring us another passionate picture, that's nothing more i can say abouit Gwyneth Paltrow and Anthony Hopkins, seeing is believing, you'll understand why suddenly have rumors about Ms. Paltrow is about to win her second Oscar's Best Actress this year..... this might not be the best picture of the year, but definitely is one of those you have to watch......"
2,Might Work as a Play; Not a Movie,"I understand that Proof is a Pulitzer-prize winning theatrical play (best drama). Well, the story might work well as a play; but falls flat as a movie. Amazingly bad acting from such a talented cast, limp plot, terrible dialogue, and no interesting visuals to speak of (hence, a bad subject for a film, which is a visual art form).I thought the film might appeal to my interest in intellectual films (okay, my interest in pretentious art films loved by psuedo-intellectuals such as myself). However, even in the pretentious intellectual art film category, it fails miserably. It's hard to put my finger on exactly why I disliked the film so much; it might be that the actors didn't seem to believe in the story - as if they knew they were asking the audience of too much, that this story in any way was believable. Because the actors were not invested in their own characters, I simply could not emotionally connect to any them, hence, the poor film experience."
3,Doesn't add up,"Apart from a cringingly bad screenplay (at times I literally cringed) and some rather bad acting from the sister character (Hope Davis--is this woman even an actor??), ""Proof"" was worth watching to the end (basically in hopes of learning more about the alleged proof). Jake Gyllenhaal was fine though unconvincing both as a math geek and in his affection for Gwyneth Paltrow's troubled character; there may have been math between the two, but there certainly wasn't chemistry! Anthony Hopkins does an admirable job playing yet another borderline insane character. Overall, however, this film missed any and all marks entirely, to me at least. A huge fan of ""Shakespeare in Love"", I was surprised to learn the same director was at work here. Maybe he (John Madden) was shy to point out dialog that simply didn't work or had trouble envisioning the whole equation. Poignant story with much potential, but ""Proof"" simply fails to add up."
3,disappointed about the size,"I thought this was a full size spatula, but it is a small one. Take note of the size before buying it. It is also somewhat more flexible than I wanted, so I rarely use it. It's not a bad spatula, just know that it is small and thin metal."
5,Excellent Server - Oxo Strikes Again,"Oxo has quickly become one of my favorite purveyors of kitchen products. This is another good one that is well balanced, durable, comfortable to hold, and works great at anything from flipping pancakes to digging a triangle slide of quiche out of a deep pie dish."
4,A Great Southern Gospel Cd.,"I love 9 of the 11 songs. I could do without ""Woke Up This Morning"" and ""If You Never Tell Me Why"". I would have given this cd 5 stars if those 2 songs weren't on it. The rest of the songs are great. I especially love it when Lauren Talley sings lead. Lauren is my favorite female southern gospel singer. She is very soulful. I also love and highly recommend Lauren's solo cds. My favorite song on ""The Message"" cd is ""His Life For Mine"". This is one of my favorite songs ever written. It is beautiful and moving. This cd is worth getting for that one song alone, but there are other great songs too. I love the old-time jazz sound of ""Forever in His Care"", which was also recorded by First Call. The vocals of Lauren Talley are outstanding."
4,Very functional,"I work in two different time zones so this watch is very functional. It is light, adjustable to my wrist size and water resistant. All in all, a great find."
