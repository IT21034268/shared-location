3,Got to be a diehard Crumley fan for this one,"If you've never read Crumley, read his earlier work in ""Dancing Bear"" or ""The Wrong Case"" before this one. They have the same sensibility and feel, but the stories are tighter and the books just work better.Yes, this book is better written than a lot of hackwork you'll find out there in the crime and mystery genre, but after reading other stuff he's written I guess I'm holding him to a higher standard."
3,Keep a list,"You're going to need a list to keep track of the characters and relationships. This proved to be a distracting aspect to the usual sex, drugs and violence we expect from Crumley. Isn't CW getting a little old for this?Michael Connelly gets a nice tip of the hat here and also in James Lee Burke's Latest."
2,More Degrees of Viciousness,"Crumley's ""The Last Good Kiss"" remains, for me, a top-notch hard-boiled piece of fiction, one of the very best. But this book goes way overboard because it relentlessly heads in far too many directions and ends up with a few - not just one - ludicrous situations and developments. lt's a book which becomes uglier as the plot moves forward and ends with at least 2 quite unsatisfying resolutions, including - SPOILER - the showing up of several characters from out of nowhere, especially a teenager seeking vengeance on one of the antagonists who had disappeared and hidden in a very remote location. How in heaven's name he was found is never, never explained...along with other important matters not revealed. As l tried to fill in the multitudinous gaps in the plot, my imagination was stretched to the limit by this disappointing Crumley effort."
3,Leave-in (previous version was better),"I bought this expecting the same product as lancme's previous leave-in version, the oily one. It is not as good."
1,Not as good as it once was!,"I have used TOPCOTE spray for several years on my table saw. This product does not seem to look or last like the old orange colored can or the real old pump spray bottle that I use to get. The current stuff now has a white flakey coating that flakes off and is sticky, the boards don't seem to slide like before. Now my new can is half full and won't spray any more! I checked the spray tip and it's not clogged but still nothing comes out when I push on the spray tip! It's like it lost its air! Don't waste your money it's not as good as it once was!At the woodworkers guild meeting they recommended I use this new stuff called Table Top Lube from EMPIRE and they gave me a small sample. I tried it and it seems to work just like the old TopCote stuff!Here on amazon Table-Top Lubricant sells for $14.99.It cost more but I think it is work it."
2,Bostik's Top Cote,"I agree with Bradley Keller's review. I bought this to treat the top of my table saw. I was horrifed by the milk-white hazy layer that the Top Cote left after applying (per directions). The stuff smells like wax, and on application looked like wax, so I figured it needed bufffing. I hand buffed my table saw top for about an hour and the haze cleared up, but I found that my saw top was not as slick as I had expected it to be. I plan on using auto wax from now on."
2,Works as advertised (just not in California),"I have been using Top-Cote for years and it works very well and produces a slippery surface that inhibits rust. Does not prevent rust if your tools get wet, but its not supposed to. I ordered a can after not being able to find it at any of my usual suppliers. Although I ordered Top-Cote and the Amazon.com order confirmation I received said I ordered Top-Cote, I was sent Glide-Cote for the same price even though Glide-Cote sold for $8 less per can. I was never told there was a substitution in the product being deliver and never asked if the substitution was okay. When I questioned it, I was given the run around by Hartville Tool and was eventually give a refund of $1.95. I will not be ordering any product from Hartville Tool again nor any anything from Amazon that is fulfilled by Hartville Tool. While I have had good experiences when ordering from Amazon, I think Hartville Tool has a lot to learn about customer service and honesty."
4,Wonderful,"Suave is the perfect word to describe Adam Wade's music.Gifted and blessed with a strong resemblance to Johnny Mathis' vocal styling, this singer sure can carry a tune in a rather effortless way. His version of the often-recorded `Take Good Care Of Her' is in my book the best that I've come across so far. His rendition of `I Can't Help It' is not really that exceptional but it's not scruffy either. The arrangement of `The Prisoner's Song' is rather odd and so foreign from what I expected, lacking the feeling and lamentation that the song ought to convey. But that should not distract from the overall brilliance of this recording.I haven't heard of Mr. Wade before this album but I took the chance anyway to invest on this CD. Needless to say that chance paid off."
3,Messy roller,"The tips are very nice, it's easy to get the right amount of glue in just about any spot. I'm not crazy about the roller. It is very difficult to dosage the amount of glue while rolling. A separate bottle and roller are much easier to manage. Good idea, execution so-so."
1,potential? yes. Worthwhile purchase? no.,"A singer must have a certain appeal to their voice to succeed in the music business. Ms. Becky Taylor is only 12 years old and should sit down for a second and realize that. Although every young girl should aspire to achieve their hopes and dreams, Becky Taylor, especially so early on in her life, and possibly her career, should NOT aspire to be the next Charlotte Church. She should continue to perfect her craft and wait a few years. At this stage in her life she should not be putting out CDs. I do not own the CD myself, but heard it at a friend's house, and I am glad that I didn't buy it. Although Becky Taylor certainly has potential in her voice, she should wait a couple years or she will probally just be upset with rejection in the near future by people that REALLY know their music."
4,The book was about bubble gum.,It was a very good book because it kept me busy. I really like the science projects and I'm using one this school year. I'm glad you went to al the trouble of geting so much information on bubble gum.
3,"Collectables CDs usually sound good, but I think this CD is sourced from an LP","Even on the samples provided here many 'tics' are clearly heard, and there is some sibilance. Perhaps the master tapes were not possible to locate, or maybe they were destroyed."
3,"Cutting edge in 1945, but better books are available now.","This is one of a series produced during the Second World War, when the U.S. government hired the best linguists available to turn out materials that would teach foreign languages to soldiers fast. It is the same methodology now used to teach languages to U.S. diplomats.In spite of the publication date given above, this book was first published in 1944 or 1945 and the content is dated. Sound recordings are available, but I have heard criticism from Brazilians of the pronunciation.Excellent books and recordings have been published since The War, and they will be more congenial to most students."
2,This was for a gift and quite disappointing,"The book does not contain as many designs, or as much design information as expected ... I guess that's why there is no ""look inside"" feature."
3,Book of flowers,So I got this to help me at work and it did help me with learning the identification of flowers. I thought the idea's and arrangements were a little too basic and outdated.
2,Strange Little Book,"This book definitely gives some unique and nice reasons for liking someone. I liked most of them. However, for some of them the author is so ""real"" about why people like other people that he lists not necessarily healthy reasons. For example, one page says that they like the other person because if they get mad at them, they also get mad back...when someone is nice to you when you're mad at them it makes you want to punch them in the nose. True? Sometimes. But not how I want to teach my child to be. Another example is they like the other person because when they say something funny the other person laughs. Does that mean when someone doesn't laugh you shouldn't like them?The last page has a bizarre illustration of a little girl feeding a little boy who is all tied up.In my opinion the age range should be 8 and up rather than 4 to 8.The illustrations are all black and white sketch drawings."
5,great movie,"great movie for the kids and adults as well. we all have a little kid still inside us, trying to get out."
1,Horrendous in every way,"If you are thinking of watching this film, go drop something very heavy on your foot. The experience with distract you more and pain you less.All about this mini-series is awful. Acting, costumes, wigs, casting, cinematography, portrayal of the characters - all were worse than I have ever seen or could have imagined.The 20-plus brainless snobs who have given this series a 4-5 star review are not the enlightened literate ones, as they would like you to think. They are soulless philistines who will review anything awful as good, hoping that the rest of us, who accurately judge a horror as such, will then ascribe to them some greater depth of feeling and artistic sense.Don't be fooled. The is a plodding, mindless production whose characters manage to take a plot that withstood the last 200 years, and put it in peril of surviving the tedious 3 hours of this series."
3,Story is right. Production is little off.,"My wife and mother-in-law are huge Jane Austen fans. For myself, I enjoy the peculiarities of the characters, the glimpse into English country life -- of the better classes, of course (!), and the notion that there could actually have been people who spoke to one another with courtesy, restraint, refinement, and -- not the least -- grammatical English.According to my in-house experts, the story is correct, the characters close enough, and the scenes about as they had envisioned them.That said, the pace is a little slow (even for Jane Austen) and the production values are decidedly inferior to those of the A&E; production of ""Pride and Prejudice"" or Emma Thompson's ""Sense and Sensibility"" or Gwynneth Paltrow's ""Emma.""We enjoyed it, but were certainly not ""wowed."""
2,Your mother's (or grand mother's) BBC,"Yes, it's strictly old-school period movie. Dry as saltines. Fans of Austen will be better served watching the new Andrew Davies screenplay version, which is much less staid."
2,"Ok, just ok...","I loved the book, just liked this movie. True to the book, but the movie was long and poorly made. For fans of the book only. If you have not read the book you will not like this movie. The film making is not the best in the world but is does the job of telling the story. I think that Sylvestra did a good job of portraying Fanny. A little different, when she cries she goes a little overboard, but I think that was how Fanny was intended to be."
1,Nothing is good from Pyle-pro so far,"I have tried lot of different PA systems from Pyle-Pro...I don't know how a company can make such useless products. None of them work as expected.The wireless mic is useless. literally the mic should be in your mouth to speak.I even tried with wired mic but still the sound comes out of this unit is very ugly.If you speak through it and record it, I am 100% sure you won't be able to recognized your own voice.Don't waste your time and money."
1,Another great idea gone wrong,"I have gone through two of these units. First would not work straight out of the box, sent it back and they replaced it easily. Cant beat Amazon customer service, but this product is not a good one. The second one has been in use for 4 months and it just went kaput this morning. I used it twice daily for meetings in a very loud factory. They just wont hold up. Go with a name brand, you will be happier."
5,Small Amish clothes hooks,"These are very nice clothes hooks that can hold medium sized items like a single pair of pants or a shirt. It looks nice, too - not the same old clothes hook."
1,The Dremel ...,"I thought the dremel would be a good tool for my needs, and it was, but the tool did not last. The tool could not hold up to the work it was made out to be for. I was under the impretion that it was tough and it was not. I own two of the Dremels and they bouth lasted less then a year each."
2,Dremel,"In my opinion,the tool is great for small tasks, but the quality is somewhat to be desired. In just one year I have went thru 3 of these tools and in my opinion its the variable speed switch that was defective. The tools always went bad when I needed it most. Ill go shoppin for some other tool next time."
5,Another superb Balzac's novel,Another occasion to live again an exceptionnal human adventure with Balzac.A lot of emotion and intelligence ...
4,"It's About Time, my review from Barcelona","I absolutely agree with Ronnie Cowlishaw's opinion. This is Texas Blues at his best: excellent guitar, excellent piano and really great songs really, all of them high level, even the two wonderful versions of ""Cold, cold feeling"" and ""T-Bone shuffle""; and I say `even' because I just before writing my review about this phenomenal 'It's about time' record, I have been listening to Albert Collins's versions of these two Blues and, believe me, listening the Collin's guitar and voice takes into another dimension.Concerning Bell and Bowser's record I recommend it and I give it 4 stars."
5,"Junior,s great nephew",I'm David Norton Junior is my uncle. This is a great book if your intrested in the way we live in the mountains you should get this book full of great photos of my uncle and aunt Dellie and one great picture of my grandpa Willard.
5,Great music for a beginning listener,"This is my first recording of any Ravel orchestral works, and I'm immediately drawn to it by it's sheer accessibility. Having heard other of Abbado's recordings,(most notably his recording of Sibelius's symphonies) I know that he often doesn't do everything he can with the music at hand, but I think it lends this music a somewhat lighter tone, which is not unpleasant. Overall, I'm quite pleased with this purchase, though I (obviously) can't compare this to the other recordings that are mentioned in comments below mine. For the price, it's a great buy."
3,Fuzzy Pictures,"I just bought this camera for a month. I took a roll (400) of pictures but it came out fuzzy. It seemed like the lens can't focus the object right. Plus, it's not as perfect as I thought before I bought it. Anyway, I like the style and the compact size of this camera. I would still recommend it as it comes with a remote control which I think it's worth for the price.This is my second review on this camera and it's been six months already. I think the camera is getting better and better. Might be the first roll (400) I didn't use it properly, so that's why they pictures came out fuzzy. Then I started using regular 100 and 200, the pictures are very good actually. I would strongly recommend it."
4,Talking dictionary,"This is my second unit after I gave the first one to my wife. Although I cannot rate it excellent in every aspect, I can say this is a very useful tool. I like it especially for the opportunity to review pronunciation in a very simple way. It sounds a little bit weird, but it is acceptable.The display contrast ratio does not always allow good reading conditions and the speaker volume is not too high, but the possibility to use headphones improves the understandability of the spoken words.The possibility to carry a dictionary and a thesaurus in a very portable unit turns this device into a very useful tool, and it is definitely worth the money."
2,Sadly disappointed,"I've always wanted to own a hand held talking dictionary, but I was somewhat disappointed in the product, especially the tone of the voice, it comes across muffled, nothing like the voice if one would log into Merriam-Webster's online dictionary and here a word pronounced."
4,high number of words- So So definitions (compared to cambridge adnvanced learner's)- A little slow in operation,It has many words- So So definitions (compared to cambridge adnvanced learner's dictionary)- A little slow in operation
4,Georgian houses in Ireland (UK edition),"I have a simple Georgian house in Ireland so this is the perfect book for me. Most books are about either Georgian stately homes in the UK or American Colonial houses. The Irish Georgian houses, on the whole, are smaller and more intimate and therefore whilst still of the period are not quite so fancy. This book covers different types of houses from grand through manor to cottage. The pictures are wonderful, the text doesn't have to be read though it is interesting.Well worth having if you're investigating Georgian houses in Ireland either from a research point of view or are in the process of restoration. However, it does not have great detail but does give a good flavour through the splendid photographs."
2,From Back Cover,"HE WANTED HIS BABY...When he learned Charlotte Masters was pregnant with his child, Rafe Connelly moved mountains to find her - one step ahead of the killers who'd put a bounty on her head. Despite her protests, Rafe needed to keep Charlotte safe. For the sake of his unborn child, he'd do anything... even marry the woman who'd betrayed hi family.SHE WANTED HIM...Oozing confidence and masculinity, Rafe was irresistible. Charlotte knew she could deny him nothing. Hadn't she already shed her prim facade and satisfied his every desire in a torrid night of pure pleasure? But she couldn't accept his proposal, for a woman with secrets, Rafe was dangerous as the killers at her heels...[11th in Dynasties: The Connellys series]"
3,Not as good,"I really enjoyed their last album much more than this. Talk to La Bomb almost seems a bit noisy and unorganized at times. There are no nice smooth, beautiful songs like ""Me Gustas Cuando Te Callas"", and it lacks a lot of that good chill lounge beat that I came to love. There are probably three songs on this CD I really enjoy, the rest are kind of blah."
4,My dog loves this toy.,We found our puppys new favorite toy. Its great to play tug of way or fetch with and also squeaks which puppys love! Great for a puppy of small dog.
4,Raimi delivers once again,"Sam Raimi is one of the few directos who can make a crap film into a masterpiece case in point For Love Of The Game. Next to the Dead trilogy this my favorite Raimi film. The film has fast paced action, awe inspring cinematography and a everyman hero in the form of Liam Nesson. As for the sequels there just your standard direct to DVD fare."
3,Not Long Lasting,"This clock worked just fine for a little over a year. Then it just quit. Seemed there was no reason but when I went to wind it like I did every evening, the key kept popping back and not winding. Time just stopped. It was like the mechanism, inside, sprung and it could no longer be wound.Sad because I liked the clock. I assumed a wind up would last a long, long time. But, that's not the case with this clock. I'll be ordering a new one and it will be a different brand"
1,you get what you pay for,"sorry, purchased 2 of these clocks for my brother, since his local wall mart storedoes not carry wind up clocks any more, because too many people are returningthem because they quit working. never the less he still wanted these wind up clocks, just talk to him and found out, one clock is still running but the otherlasted only 2 weeks before it broke. they don't make things like they use tohis old BIG BEN lasted years. I don't know where it was made, certainlynot by the swiss i bet, just wondering how long the second clock will last.or was the first one defective"
3,"Defective casting, no mounting interface for fence","Used to swear by these, but am questioning the quality of current mfg. as my new set just arrived with cracked casting.Seems to be poor QA at the factory...Also, be prepared to build your own fence mounting interface-they should disclose the availability of a mounting rail, etc. as the lack of info. results in much wasted time.We'll see how the replacements look-will try one more time...frustrating."
3,ok,"Looks nice,easy to install,quality seems good.My husband purchased this less than 6 months ago and already there is a slow drip.I believe a washer would fix this,overall good faucet."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!,This CD is the book being read by a text to speach piece of software. It is totally unacceptable & far too difficult to listen to.
1,Tinasky v. Pynchon,"Despite Ms. Factor's disparaging review of Don Foster's literary detective work, I highly recommend his book ""Author Unknown,"" which methodically explains why ""Wanda Tinasky"" could not be Pynchon."
2,No Engaging Plot,"Many of these characters' lives were so full of boredom and sadness. The acting was OK, but not great. I had trouble identifying with any of the characters in a film which seemed to jump from subject to subject. No political risks in the movie. They all seemed like strangers. Nice idea for a movie, but they didn't follow through.Interesting scenery and it was fun to feel like you were experiencing France first hand...those are the only positive parts of the film."
4,Perez digs Stan Kenton,"Misnamed: If the title and the cover make you think you're in for some mellow sexy late night Havana groove, guess again! This is more Hollywood bowl. Perez Prado at his most Kenton-esque, which means that things can get pretty strange, in the manner of Kenton's notion of the ""modern"" style. You even have Maynard Ferguson doing his master-of-the-stratosphere thing. The arrangements of standards like El Manicero and Bahia (""Baia"") are so Kentonian as to be far removed from the typical Latin idiom. None of this constitutes criticism. This is the most fun PP album I've come upon.(PS Did Prado teach James Brown to punctuate his songs with Big Grunts? That's a serious question. I've always wondered if he was digging Perez...)"
3,.YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE !,Angel pig and the hidden Christmas is a good book!It is about a family of pigs who used up all their money and don't have any money to buy Christmas gifts.They don't believe they can have Christmas without money!Then a mysterious soul tells them that they can do it.He also says that you just have to believe!This is a very touching book.I recomend it to kids between the ages of 7 and 9.
3,You will need a lot more than this one book,"In Russian there is an expression ""ne myaso, ne ryba"" - literally: neither meat not fish. It means it's not one thing or the other. The Screenwriter's Bible is such a book.It claims to be six books in one, whereas it is really one book divided into six sections, none of them thorough. That's not to say it is without merit. It's just if this is all you buy you will be woefully under prepared in any one of the six areas Trotter claims to have covered.The book will give you a fair outline of the geography, name the major towns, if you like. But you'll still need a decent local map or two when you get into the county.It says it is complete. It is not. What it is, is a well-thought through marketing campaign on the general subject of writing screenplays. I don't say avoid it. But get lots more books which are clearly either meat or fish."
4,Great Shape,The book was in much better shape than I thought it would be for the price. I am very pleased with my order and would order from them again.
4,A Nice Resource for Budding Screenwriters,The book captivated me upon first viewing more than any other books available on the topic of screenwriting. the fact that it is a six book in one package makes it a valuable checklist for beginner screenwriters to consult this book solely for the tips to screenwriting and script-selling world.
5,A Must Have,"If you can appreciate a doctor's need for Gray's Anatomy or a writer's need for the Elements of Style, then as a beginning screenwriter, you should consider reading the Screenwriter's Bible."
5,Great stories,"I was going to resell this book, but I think I'm going to keep it. Great stories inside!"
2,Lacking in Details,"If you are new to MFC and Visual C++, this book will help you. When you want to start learning why some things are done a certain way, you are out of luck.This book will walk you through the basics of using the MFC in Visual C++. You will learn the steps you take in VC to do basic component manipulation in MFC but only on the surface. The examples are not really that good. Sure they convey the principle but that's about it. I found myself with more questions to ask and no answers to be found.If you have never done any MFC programming before, this is a good place to start. Otherwise, my advise is to keep looking.-=} Randall {=-"
4,Very nice product-overall very happy,"I like this item very much. It arrived very quickly in great condition. Beware though: if you are not a person who can follow picture instructions, good luck. There are no installation instructions in English with this product. Only a few blurbs throughout the whole installation manual is in English. Overall though we are very happy with this product."
3,Apache Cookbook: Solutions and Examples for Apache Administrators,"The book descriptor lists Apache ver. 2.0, and 2.2. The Kindle e-book I recieved covers ver. 1.3 and 2.0. (As I'm trying to set up ver 2.2, I'm a bit miffed.) There is an option to upgrade the book through the publisher (at the cost of another 5 bucks) which may fix this issue. (at present I don't have the 5 bucks)"
4,The Universe,I have become extremely interested in how the universe works. These videos are super! I have only gone through one disc.
2,"VERY, VERY BADLY OVER RATED","I purchased this blade about 12 months back and was thrilled with it for about one month. It cut through maple and cherry (up to 2"" thick) ""like butter."" And then it was dull and prone to all the trials and tribulations of dull blades (kick-back, etc.). When it was brand new it cut better than any blade I have owned but at the price it should! At the price, it should also have retained its edge for a lot longer (I've had really cheap (Skil 10"") and mid-priced (Hitachi, et al) blades last MUCH longer and some even started off almost as sharp).Again, for one month of 6 day a week use it was GREAT but it dulled much too quickly - regardless of the price (and yes, I did clean and treat the blade at the end of each day). So, whyh pay the price unless it comes with free sharpening and a loner blade for the time it spends ""away"" every four or five weeks.If the blade cost $50.00 I would rate it 3 to 3.5 stars."
2,Not worth the price..,"I used this blade for cutting pine but It did not impressed me at all. I found my Freud industrial blade ( combination ) giving more clean cuts on pine.I guess most of the reviews were for cutting pine, but most woodworkers don't use pine as it is weak / soft wood.After using this blade for one project with pine and Redwood, I did not felt the price was worth it. Nothing impressive at all..Save your money and get Freud combination at less than half the price or go for Oldham combination blade."
4,TAP THE ROCKIES!!!,"Wondermints continue their tradition of tight melodic harmonies that make them the ""wonder"" they are. A must for any PoP lovers fan! I especially love the Rejected Beer Ad. (Big mistake for Coors!)Get this one!!!"
4,Good Basic Product,"The use of an eye cream could be obsolete in an everyday routine but this eye cream is non greasy, light and very pleasant to wear, specially under eye make up. I like it."
5,Wonderful story of an all-american family. Good read for military wives.,Wonderful story of an all-american irish catholic family after World War II. Good read for military wives with spouses deployed.
5,It works.,Seems to fit and work just like the expensive OE.I have my printer back online for a reasonable price.Thank you.
2,"It works, but out fast","I have used the Samsung cartridges on this printer for about 8 years in an application that is the same every year. I usually get about 1 years per cartridge. This one sells for a lot less, and runs out a whole lot sooner. I am now stuck where I may not have a printer when I really need it because this cartridge is running out."
4,Not An Average Series,"I really like the Simon Serrallier books I've read so far. .At the risk of leaking a ""spoiler"", not all crimes are solved, but that's what happens in police work, though we might all wish otherwise. Simon's co-workers and family members are complex characters you wish you could meet; his sister is a caring physician, his mother a creative, energetic woman of many facets, his father an intelligent though tormented soul, his mysterious brother in Australia has not become manifest so far. But I want to read more."
4,"Come on, it ain't that bad!","I must admit that it took me some time to get through the entire book, but it wasn't because I didn't like it! The writing is fine, the characters fully realized, certainly readable. I thought it was better than the negative reviews state. However, I did find the kidnapping less than gripping (I don't have kids, so maybe I just didn't relate well enough). Simon's treatment of the woman who loves him was pretty despicable, but I knew a lot of men who acted like that when I was younger. All in all, a good book with some drawbacks. Couldn't one say that of every book? (The Bible comes to mind...)"
2,The Pure In Heart,"This is an interesting mystery regarding the kidnaping of a small boy. The mystery has several twists and turns as well as a number of side stories that don't seem to connect to the mystery at all. It actually seems to involve more the private life of the primary detective and his family than it does the mystery at hand. The story begins with Simon Serrailler, the primary detective, on holiday in Venice and he receives a call from his father that his sister is ill and probably dying. He hurries home and his sister recovers - only to die sometime later. But the story of his sister has nothing to do with the disappearance of the boy and could be considered a distraction - or should the kidnaped child be considered the distraction? At one point, I seriously thought the child had been kidnaped to deflect the attention of the police from another matter. The book is well-written but I don't think it should be classified as a mystery but as general fiction."
2,Where's the ending?,"Calling this a Simon Serrailler mystery is certainly a stretch. So far, he is 0 for 2 in the mystery solving department. Perhaps he should turn in his badge and concentrate on drawing. In this novel, even the author doesn't solve the mystery, and there are so many loose ends that the novel doesn't really have an ending. It simply stops. Worst of all, the characters grow ever more unpleasant, especially Simon himself--who comes across as a egotistical and condescending cad. I would not recommend this series to anyone who enjoys the conventional mystery genre."
5,Chilling,In this book from beginning to end it is good. Its one of those books where its hard to stop reading and when you do stop reading it its all you think about. I wasnt able to read it at night and I am a person who does not get scared easily! It is indeed a very chilling book. And it is a thriller. Bottom line if you love books that can give you goosebumps. Read this book. The characters are real and excellent and it is a real page turner. I love it!
3,kids book,This is a good story but it is a children't book. Good story though. I plan to give it to my 15 yr. old niece
3,nice blade but not the best for the price,"I purchased about 4 forrest blades, one of each type, including one for solid surfaces. The blades cut 'nice', not like what i expected after reading all the hype about them on the internet. I wont get into all the details or specifics but just know that we have been running our kitchen manufacturing firm for over 10 years putting out loads of kitchens every year, so the experience of using different blades is there. All i am going to say is, switching to forrest is not worth the money, stick with freud, they stay sharper longer. I put my new forest blades back in the box and bought a bunch of new freud replacements!"
2,Disappointed,"I bought this blade because of someone's recommendation. I am disappointed with the performance of this blade as it causes a lot of burnt marks on my wood, both solid and plywood. It also does not cut as smoothly as my lower cost blades. May be it needs to be sharpened but it is brand new and I can't find anyone locally to sharpen it."
2,Burns everything...everything,"Does it cut quickly, easily, and evenly? Yes. Does it leave a nice smooth surface? Yes. Does it burn EVERY single cut, whether ripping or cross-cutting regardless of species? Big Yes.I consulted the manual and it talks about large reductions in temperature if used with the blade raised up well above the surface of the wood. What? I'm sorry, but for this kind of money I'm not going to risk cutting my fingers off any more than I have to just to get your product to work as well as you claim. I know a professional cabinet maker who has experienced the same burning issues with multiple Forrest table saw blades.Happily going back to my Dewalt 40-tooth ATB which works equally well and is less than half the price. This must be hype or something."
5,The Wonder Blade,I can't say enough good things about this blade. Spend the money and get the last saw blade you will ever own. Try to find another blade that leaves a cross cut at a better than sanded finish.
1,Disappointed,"I recently purchased this blade after seeing demonstrations at a wood working show and hearing reviews great reviews from friends. All I can say is I am very disappointed. Every cut that I have tried cross cuts and rips, have resulted in burnt wood. I checked my blade alignment to the miter slot and to the fence, and they each check out parallel to the blade within 005. I have switched to another new 40-tooth carbide blade and the problem goes away. I'm not sold...and I am returning it."
5,Masterworks!,"Mozart's String Quintets are stunningly beautiful. They are filled with such an incredible (and at times unsettling) range of different emotions, including sadness and angst. The String Quintets in C Major (K. 515) and G Minor (K. 516) are my absolute favorites. The playing on this set is elegant and smooth. Highly recommended."
4,a young Teddy Roosevelt gives Longarm a hand,"I really like how the Evans incorporates a young Teddy Roosevelt into the plot of this Longarm, which takes place in the badlands of North Dakota (not the ones in South Dakota as I had thought first going into this). The writing is excellent as usual. My only deduction of one star is for the plot, because there was no mystery involved and it kind of fizzles toward the end. Also, the beginning is not related at all to the main plot. But overall, recommended."
2,Disappointed in overall quality,"Being a big fan of the GearWrench ratcheting wrenches I was excited to try out their socket ratchets. It wasn't long before I was disappointed, the on/off switch will often click over so you might get 5 turns loosening a bolt and for no reason the switch turns and on your 6th pull it starts to tighten.The 1/2"" wrench broke after first use, the on/off switch would no longer function.And lastly I missed having a socket quick release, a really handy feature to have when one hand is tied up holding something."
1,What's this all aboot?,"I don't get it! I thought this book was all aboot midgets, but it's all aboot racing instead. That isn't any good. That is false information. I can't stand the author anymore, even though we had a brief love affair in the past."
2,buy separtely!,"Don't buy this set unless you can't get the stick and block separately. The featherboard is complete trash and should be thrown away immediately. I haven't used the stick, though it looks like you could make a longer and nicer one in a few minutes. I do, however, use the push block all the time and have found it to be very useful. There are certainly applications were it doesn't work that a custom one would, but that's always the case. I can recommend the push block, could go either way on the stick and just put the featherboard in the trash and back away. Buy the other two separetly if you want them and save [$$$]."
1,Not helpful for 95% of law students,"I agree with the previous reviewer from New York. According to the author of this book, you ought to simply throw in the towel if you're not in the top 10% of a top tier law school. The top 10% students at my top tier law school didn't need any job search advice; the jobs came to them.So who is this book written for, hmmm?The days of the huge law firm are numbered. New associates are abandoning megafirms like rats from sinking ships. Perhaps Ms. Turnicky and Mr. Theroux ought to consider putting their talents to work writing a relevant, forward-looking job search guide."
2,Another Disappointment,"The scent is OK only; it is not a great smell. The diffuser does not work that great and you almost cannot feel the scent except when you get closer to the diffuser. For the price, it is very disappointing!"
3,"Great quality product, Needed mods to fit Delta 34-370",The quality of this product was very good. However I had to make modifications to the insert and my Delta 34-370 cast iron table to get it to fit correctly.
2,over-priced,"...you get a piece of plastic laminate covered fiber board that does not even sit flush with the top of the table saw (it sticks up about 1/32""). Supposedly this device is supposed to help stabilize the saw blade (especially a thin-kerf blade), reduce chipping and noise. This may be true, but then it should be a standard feature that comes with the saw rather than the regular insert. I would skip this and build one yourself for a fraction of the cost."
2,"Worth the money, interface crude and slow","Terrible user interface, takes about 15 seconds to go from one game to the next. Ok for the price.Under vista has a problem as it screws up my second monitor which I use to extend the desktop.Summary, slow to start up, very sloooooow between games."
1,Content ideas,"I was eager to get the ""game"" but disapointed that it was visually more for a young person's eye, mind. I made an assumption that this would help me memory issues. Some of the ""lessons"" are good in their timing etc., but in general the content is out of line for adults 30's on up.Thanks for listening.""More Brain Games by OnHand 32228 00238"
5,No need to sand after a cut is made with this one!,Really cuts great. I installed it on my Porter Cable Sliding compound miter saw and it performs just great. No need to sand after a cut is made with this baby...
1,Fake Product,"I dont understand how fakes could be put up for sale on Amazon, a reputable online shopping platform. I have only worn it twice, and it is already breaking off.I am in my office at this moment,writing this review and am very embarassed because i shouldn'thave worn it to work. Amazon should ensure quality products, no matter the brand names they sell. I am very disappointed, it is a waste of hard earned dollars and i am definately throwing it away when i get home.TERRIBLE PURCHASE"
1,Steel 4.5mm Screwdriver Security Bit Open SNES,Item shorter than the screwdriver in the picture. Started to strip screws on my SNES. Stopped as soon as that happened and now I have to find another screwdriver to replace this product. Got what I paid for. :( Lesson learned and moving on.
3,does the job but is limited,it is a great product however you should know IT DOES NOT OPEN N64 GAMES nor does it open Gameboy games only the console. however it is very good at that and doesnt allow for any struggle when in use
3,Not a bad tool.,"It is a bit cheap, like described by the other review. But as long as you keep this in mind and use the tool carefully, it will be ok. I used mine to open an N64 and it wore the teeth a bit, but it didnt ruin it. I dont expect to get too many more uses out of it before it's completely stripped out. But if you're planning on working on a few systems it's worth it."
3,Bought to repair Game boy advanced SP,No problems with the Game boy advanced SP right now but I like being prepared. It fits the bolt on the back so it should work.
1,bad product,"This tool was useless! It was too big to fit in the screw holes on the games and when I tried to open an old console, all I managed to do was damage the teeth on the tool,ruinning it!"
2,opps i did it again,"I was hoping for some rare footage of tanks and planes shot in 3D , i got a good look at how allied planes were going to get a surprise from Nazi observers , also looked at a really old french guy taking pictures in 3d during ww2 , BRAVO ! on a serious note i am a sucker for WWII stuff as my grandparents and Family members always talked about the WAR. i just wasnt expecting this. IF youre into how 3d was used by in WW2 it still doesnt have alot of information, overall i wont reccomend this to anyone. My grandad would have taken me out back and put me down if he saw this-god bless his soul"
3,Kind of a jip,"Though this short documentary does show some impressive 3D images, it repeats them over and over with some guy who sounds like he's more on a ghost hunt than narrating a documentary. If you've ever seen Dazed and Confused, the scene where Jon Stewart keeps saying things like, ""Ya ever listen to music...on weeeeeeeed?"" Then you'll know what I mean when the narrator repeats over and over, ""never before has this been seen in threeeee deeeeeeeee"". The film really doesn't reveal or teach anything new about WWII. They even used up about 3 minutes of the film showing old ""Viewmaster"" clips in the attempt to drag this thing out to 45 minutes."
2,Not what expected.,This is not a movie about WW11 in any way it more about 3D itself was really not worth it!!
3,Old classic given new life,"Wonderful to see that books which were best-sellers back in the 1920s can be brought back to life. Beautifully reprinted, though the uneven cutting of the pages is irritating to the reader. Otherwise, well done!"
1,whomever published this version hasn't read the book,"The text of this book is the actual text of the original book, but the cover is totally wrong. There is a dragon on the front- an animal that is mentioned no where in the book. It is as if the publisher has never read this book. I also didn't realize that this was a large print book- so be warned that this book is basically a print out, in large font, of the book with a random cover on it. Unlike the actual book, there are no pictures or maps or glossary which really would add to the value of the read."
4,"A true story, told by a hunter for hunters","No doubt it is true. A must for everyone who has seen the movie 'Ghost & the Darkness'. Story of two man eating lions slaughtering railway construction workers in Tsavo, then the British East Africa and how they were eliminated. If you have ever hunted or had a brush with wild cats in the wild you will get the same feeling of nervousness and helplesness again. It is also very informative regardng african tribes and the customs we rarely see even on television these days. The movie was good the book just makes it better."
4,Good,"I though this was a good story - some scary moments. A better story in the same vein is ""Maneaters of Kumaon""."
5,A Fiiting Tribute to the Greatest Lawmen in History,"This isn't just for Texans although it should increase every Texan's Texas Pride. The feats of the Rangers almost defy belief and this video shows them in all their glory - from hunting down Bonnie and Clyde to one Ranger facing down 15,000 Ku Klux Klansmen in Waco to the Rangers almost singlehandedly winning the Mexican-American War. The darker pages in Ranger history - in particular the period during the Mexican Revolution of the early 20th Century are not glossed over but are placed in their proper context.The Rangers were tough men but Texas was a tough place those days. As the author and historian T. R. Fehrenbach explains they were almost always outnumbered by opponents who didn't take prisoners. The men of the Rangers deserve to be remembered and this DVD does it well."
3,Doesn't fit new Unisaw,Looks like a nice insert but is too small for the new Delta Unisaw. Must be for the older versions.
3,Decent value,"This is a well-made product, and if you typically use the same size (and kerf) blades in your table saw most of the time, it's probably worth picking one of these up. I've been using mine for about three years, and have been pleased with its durability and stability. I have made a bunch of shop-made inserts myself (1/2 inch Baltic birch with self-tapping machine screws to adjust the height). I used the original insert from the saw as a template, rough cut the plywood a band saw, and used double-stick tape to attach the original and the wood insert together. A flush trim bit on the router makes quick work of finishing."
3,"Works well... good value (Don't use it to touch the blade - it's a safety devise, remember?)","Don't ever push the board with your hands when a tool like this exists. I have hit the blade (didn't explode for me), but I would rather destroy one of these than one of my fingers. Who wants to look like their first career was a Shop Teacher in Grade 8? Also find one that is very thin, sometimes comes with a magnet to attach to the tool and have at easy reach... just ordered by third thin one and another plastic one like this one. You can never have too many so they can be kept close and the temptation to push it with your favorite forefinger doesn't occur."
5,text book,This book is a required textbook for one of my classes next semester. I look forward to reading it. Thanks
3,A page out of Dr. McCoy's past,"Shadows tells the story of a young Bones' marriage and divorce which influenced his decision to join starfleet. I liked getting the history of McCoy which helps explain his personality, and the idea of his meeting up with his wife again after all these years was intriguing. However, as the plot of this book developed it turned out to be a somewhat weak and predictable storyline.I recommend the book if you're interested in getting a piece of Dr. McCoy's life story, otherwise there are probably better star trek novels out there."
3,2 plots: Dr.McCoy's reunion w/ex-wife Jocelyn and assassins,"The title, Shadows on the Sun, is unclear, because it has nothing to do with a star. The novel has 2 plot lines. One is the meeting and negotiations with a group of terrorists on a planet, which involves a husband-and-wife team of Federation diplomats. The other plot has to do with Dr.McCoy's reunion with the wife portion of the diplomatic team--she used to be McCoy's wife before they divorced and he went to med school. I won't tell what happens at the end, but I find it amazing that in the 23rd century, assassins still exist, especially these--their actions clearly resemble the ones performed by ninja. Maybe the title should have been Negotiating with the SSan Ninja?"
5,Hail to the King!,This dado blade set is amazing! The cuts are very smooth and the 0.01 in batwings are not a problem for anyone but the woodworker themselves.
4,"I get very good reception from the tunebase, and I'm around Manhattan.","I live next to, and drive through and around, Manhattan. My tunebase works great. The sound isn't CD quality, but I'd be hard pressed to tell the difference b/w my tunebase and a normal FM radio station. My cigarette lighter does seem to be in a good position, b/c the tunebase is right next to my radio, so this may help. But I get very good sound coming from this product, and it's very stable. I also like the tuning feature, where I can tune any frequency on the tunebase, and then program it into one of the 4 presets for easier tuning later on.Good product that works well for me, in and around a big city w/ lots of radio stations.(For the NYC people, I use 91.7, 107.7, and 106.5 as the stations for my tunebase)"
2,Unusable in certain metropolitan area,"I was a non-believer when people told me that this wouldn't work in Los Angeles. I bought it. I returned it. The problem is, radio stations and electrical appliances can all introduce noise to FM transmitter/receivers. In a city as dense as Los Angeles, it's **impossible** to find a frequency that's not occupied or noisy. I ended up using a tape-adapter that connects one end to a tape cassette player and the other end to the phone jack on the ipod (or any audio-source with a phone jack).My friend worked for Belkin. I trusted Belkin to make quality products. But in this case, I was really let down. It probably works well in other cities but not in Los Angeles at least. Very sorry to say."
2,"great for power, but.........","I bought this as an upgrade for the Belkin Tunebase for power only. I stopped using my Itrip mini and was disappointed. If your considering buying this, I woudlnt. What you SHOULD do is but the Regular Belkin Charger and use the Itrip FM transmitter. Nothing beats the Itrip in my opinion and as fr the Belkin charger, it is great. Keeps your ipod out of the way and it's sturdy too. Just don't be fooled with this charger & fm transmitter. The transmitter is no good on this."
2,okay but a little less than expected,"Did not come with serial # for product registration/warranty. When I contacted manufacturer, they suggested I return it and purchase directly through them (Tourmaline). While iron gets very hot (410 degrees - I have coarse/kinky hair), does not seem to flatten/straighten hair with silkeness/shine that other ionic irons that I have used in the past do. Also generates a rather unpleasant odor."
4,Great fun! Adults too!,My 8 year old son recieved this for Christmas and he really likes it. The disks shoot out with a touch of a button. The adults had fun with it too! One person would shoot the disk and the adult would stand across the room and see who could catch the most! It made our night more lively!
2,"Great toy, but made in China","This is a fantastic toy, really durable for plastic, but made in China. Sadly, between a Communist government and the recent poison levels in many products, I would not have purchased it had I known."
3,Fair friction,The gripping surfaces have only fair friction. I screwed a thin block of wood to the back and they now work great.
4,Remember No Electricity,"This book is a wonderful record of the way things were accomplished in everyday living when electricity and cars were beginning to make their way into homes. I found it enlightening, entertaining, and educating. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in rural life, history, and short story telling. It is a wonderful book to read to kids and to elderly people."
2,Not a good bushcraft axe...,I bought this axe because I wanted an indistuctible camp axe. And with legendary estwing performance I was sure this axe would fall into line with the other products that I have purchased. However out of the box this axe was as dull as a child's toy. As I was gently using it to split some wood the axe accidentally hit the ground. The dull blade chipped. The steel is so hard that it is brittle. I have worked for hours trying to fix the edge. Very hard to hand sharpen. The axe is way to heavy for bushcraft. This one item will not change the legendary performance that I have experienced with estwing.
1,Teeeeeeeerrrrrrrible.,"Ok, ok. So they just hold microphones above my drums so I can go on making my little songs. But wait, you see, the last year of my life has been a never-ending spree of breaking these little pieces of crap.I made the sorry mistake of buying two 3-piece sets. I've gone through 6 of these. Every last one broke. You know, doing simple things, like, attaching it to the drum or attaching a microphone to the clip. If you like to start recording a drum track and get rudely interrupted because your SM57 is now dangling by your feet, then please go right ahead and buy these abysmal pieces of crap. I just recently broke the last one trying to carefully remove it from my snare drum.Please, if you record drums and are in the market for a drum mic clip, spend the extra money and buy the Shure A56D. The A56D's are rugged, sturdy, and very adjustable. Buy the Samson's if you want to add more crap to your local landfill."
3,A little less than expected,"In the work I do, I have a huge need to duplicate DVD's and I was hoping this machine would keep from having to tie up a computer. This machine does work and will duplicate the DVD's, however it is difficult to get it to the copy state because of error messages that appear on the screen. The controls (2 of them) seem to work only if pressed at precisely the right second to advance to the next section. The manual (which I requested seperately) does not help. It has very limited explanations of the functions and does not specify how to make things work. Looks like they could have been a lot more specific with the instructions. Like I said, it does work, but only after a lot of messing around. To be fair, once the DVD that I am copying is exactly the same type as the one I am copying to, it seems to go a little better. My thinking is that once everything is loaded and the copy button is pushed, it should copy. That is not the case."
2,Caveat -- misinformation,"This book may be readable but it's not accurate. For one thing, it's filled with misinformation about Freddie Bartholomew, which misinformation has subsequently been repeated all over the internet. If a star of Freddie's magnitude is misrepresented, then I wonder how much else in the book is incorrect. At the very least then take this book with a grain of salt, and do not consider it an authoritative reference book."
4,Ruger Handgun Case,"Nice exterior finish and quality build.Worked great for my Ruger Mark III .22LR pistol with a bull barrel.No, dislikes."
5,get it,"Again, it will sound like I copied everyone else's. So, I won't, I'll just say: If you are an Alan Rickman fan, you have to have this, assuming you can even get it. If you can't, go watch it on YouTube, you will experience envy...And, if you can't get it, despair..."
3,Try Raymond Leppard instead,"I was very excited at first to receive these CDs. After lestining to them, I can't say the same. In every recording the harpsichord is not recorded to the same level as the other instruments. The stringed instruments turn out to be the hero each and every single time. It almost gives it a monophonic feel to it, and is not tantalizingly polyphonic. I really suggest recordings by Raymond Leppard instead if you like the harpsichord. Aside from the solos, Marriner reduces the harpsichord likened to a bass in a jazz ensamble, just to fill in the rhythm. I agree with the other reviewer saying Marriner is more interested in making this sound like big orchestra than Bach."
3,"Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, book review","This book contains over 200 pictures of the railway, stations, bridges etc. However, there is almost no text, so get it if you want the pictures of the B&O and won't mind the lack of text."
1,"i like bcieclipse's movie packs, but this one is not one i'll keep","like i said i own many of these bcieclipse sets and have found most of them to be very good,however this set is the pits.they are now scrapeing the bottom of the public domain titles to fill their collections. not one good movie to be had here and i intend to sell this one as soon as possible."
2,A monkey could write this better!,"Jimmy was always trying to be a hero. Finally, he actually proved it. He was trying out to work for the pony express. He had to show his skills on a horse. That was the only good part in the story. Although it was almost the least favorite book that I've ever read. Jimmy was such a show off at the end because he said,""Oh man I'm a hero!"" He also went to boring places where nothing happened. For example, he was in a forest cooking doing nothing at night. That was practicly the whole chapter(...)"
4,Stiffens up an already great blade,"I use the stiffener with my thin kerf Forest II blade and it does take some of the ""wobble"" out. Well worth the price."
1,Doesn't seem to do anything...,"I didn't see any benefit from this, so I actually tested it. I made a cut with and without, and measured the kerf. They were the same. So, it limits your depth of cut without any benefit. I put mine on CL."
1,Don't Bother,"I've never bothered to review a book that i didn't like, but I had to keep others from making the same mistake i did.The fact that this book is so old should have tipped me off. The information is way out of date. Even if it was up to date, it's way too basic even for an unsophisticated searcher like me.I expected it to be a step by step on how to research and use sites, but it is just lacking.There are better books on Amazon for doing legal research on theinternet."
5,I can't beleive it!!,"Unbeleivable... Now I know where the term ""cuts like butter"" came from, Forrest, that's where."
5,And now for something completely different...,"I first learned about Attwenger from their amazing song, ""H.E. Zaum"" on the Planet Squeezebox compilation. This band takes traditional European accordian music and turns it completely on its head, mixing it with elements of punk and rap in the process. If you like innovative cross-genre music, buy this disk. It's very weird and very fun."
4,So cute!,Love this book. It's short and sweet. Simple and fun story. It keeps both me and my son's attention. I would highly recommend getting.
5,grammy loves to read,A good short book to read to a toddler. My 2 yr old granddaughter likes the story and is learning some of the words.
4,Comment and corrections,"This album certainly has its moments, Head in the Sky and Spoonful of Bromide shine through as they are more ""hard-edged"" than the rest of the album. I just wanted to comment on Dr Marcel Wild's review; where is the sax on this album? I've had a vinyl copy for 20 years and I've never heard it. Secondly, Devil's Answer sounds more commercial because it was only ever released as a single, and was never placed on an album. In fact, it is not representitive of Rooster at all! This album, although very good, loses out because the guitar is mixed right back most of the time, and everything is keyboard-dominated. In my opinion, the best album is Death Walks Behind You - nothing else by Rooster comes close."
4,very good bread mix,easy to use and great taste. Works well with bread machines or oven. I would recomend this product to anyone like me who is a beginner.
4,Excellent finished product,The bread turned out wonderful. The entire family enjoyed it.The directions on the package were clear and easily understood
5,greatest braed,"I have been using this bread for a few months best bread so far, i love the 9 grain great"
2,Smells weird!,"I don't know if this is just how this product smells or something happened to it, but it smells like a bad cleaning solution."
5,"Great product, no bulk or stickiness","I have straight hair for the most part, but the reason I love this product is that is non-sticky and does not add bulk to the hair....actually, I don't know that it is in my hair. I can't imagine going to another product."
5,A great cookbook!,"I checked out this book from my local library, as I wanted to learn some recipes. After realizing I was interested in trying every recipe in the book, I ordered it off Amazon.The recipes in this book are simple and excellent. It is by far my favorite cookbook! And as I am very conscious about my weight, I love that this book has the serving breakdown (everything except for sugar.)After you've picked a recipe to try, I recommend looking for another recipe that has similar ingredients. I was able to make two or three different meals with common ingredients based off of my original recipe."
5,"Easy, delicious and practical cooking!","As a family that eats very little meat, this cookbook has really done wonders for us! Directions are simple, recipes are great for everyday use, and we have yet to make something we haven't loved! I highly recommend it, and other books by Nava Atlas. She knows a lot about cooking for families.Many books on vegetarian cooking are so pretentious! Who has time to make something that takes three hours and requires a culinary degree, not to mention exotic (and expensive) ingredients? Also, just because something is vegetarian does not mean it is healthy. Nava takes care of all of this with easy to make, quick meals that include ingredients that most households already use and have. Also, she keeps the fat content down, and lists nutritional information for each recipe.Great book for vegetarians and omnivores alike!"
3,Recipes Somewhat Bland,"This book gets three stars from me as I enjoy the variety of vegetables. However of the recipes I have tried, they have all been bland. I prefer strong flavors and need to double the seasonings in these recipes. I suppose the recipes are lightly seasoned to let the flavors of the vegetables shine through. The chocolate chip cookies are terrible. I should have known since there is little fat in them and the brownies are slightly better but lacking in flavor. So I will stay away from the baked goods in this book. On the upside, the recipes are easy and I will continue to use them but adjust seasonings. My 8-year-old son has been enjoying most of the recipes I have prepared and my 5-year-old has eaten most of his meals too. I guess their palates are more sophisticated than mine :)"
1,Don't buy,"Don't buy this book. At least a third of it is edited out. ""less significant sections of the text"" are ""summarized"" as deemed necessary by the editor or translator. This is absolutely unacceptable. I cannot believe that I paid for a partial text. With such an egregious amount of text removed from the book, Amazon should either include a disclaimer or pull the book from the store. I feel robbed. I am reading this book for school and will have to buy the penguin version to get the full text. To call this ""History Of The Franks"" by Gregory of Tours is an outright lie. Do not buy this edition of the book."
4,Un libro per una ricerca,Ho comprato questo libro per una ricerca di storia medievale. Penso che mi sarà utilissimo. E' uno dei documenti più importanti per conoscere la storia di quel periodo.
4,One of the best Retromedia releases!,"Christine Nguyen is adorable in the lead role and pneumatic Rebecca Love is just freaking amazing in this typical spoof from Retromedia. Only this release is more explicit and has a few new faces (and bodies) to see.Don't even try to follow the plot; watch it for the wall-to-wall sex, which happens about every five minutes."
4,A good read for a good cause,"I enjoyed most of the short stories in this book, particularly Melanie Rae Thon's and Jill McCorkle's. It's a diverse collection, and it's hard to like all the stories and their styles, but I found most of them enjoyable and well-written. And it led me to read other books published by the authors I liked. If you're a fan of short stories, this is a good book to read."
1,unsatisfactory product,"The life of these cushions is very short. I've ordered at least a dozen from different sellers. They are comfortable at first but the filling compacts each day of use, defeating its purpose. By the time a week has elapsed, the cushion is hard and very uncomfortable."
3,"simplistic, maybe for very young people","Probably I did not read enough comments on this book. This is a very thin book which barely touches the surface of tesselation information. I think it was meant for young minds who are just giving first steps onto this field. It has a lot of color illustrations and directions to build some patterns which might prove useful for boys and girls up to high school age, certainly is neither for a 42-year old engineer nor for the architecture/arts student."
2,C-,"The author obviously did not have enough material for a book. He constantly digresses from one topic to another, and goes into distinct subjects with detail, obviously just to fill up space. It is the same trick high school students try to pull off to meet the minimum number of pages requirement in their writing assignments. If I did not think this practice were disrespectful towards the reader, I might even commend Hoffman for his effort at trying to link so many unrelated topics back to Erdös. That requires quite a deal of artistry. But it does not really work towards making the reader think the digressions are relevant to the story."
4,A good book,"This book wasn't really about about Paul Erdos, so if you are looking for an in-depth view of his life, this book isn't for you. What it is, however, is a book that gives a nice overview of famous mathematicians and their work. For example, it has anecdotes about Gauss, Cantor, etc. After reading this book I became familiar with many famous mathematical problems and stories."
2,"A Meandering, Lazy River through the Mathematical Forest","This was a somewhat frustrating experience for someone interested in learning more of the life of Paul Erdos. At the end of it, you feel acquainted with his quirky turns of phrase (bosses, slaves, epsilons, Sam & Joe, the great SF) but why did he engage himself with certain types of mathematics (prime numbers) and not others, what did he struggle with as he grew up, what shaped him into the memorable yet odd-ball mathematician that he became. All of these topics are brushed over lightly as Hoffman takes another digression into the life of Ron Graham, or the life of Fermat and the nature of his Last Theorem. I can't help but feel that this book was cut and pasted together from multiple, barely related writings of Hoffman until the requisite number of pages was reached to satisfy the needs of the publisher. Disappointing."
4,"Intreaging, funny, humbling. The story a truely amazing man.","I picked up this book in Glasgow airport for a quick read, probably never destined to get past page forty. I was glued from page one. It's well written, funny, truly humbling and the captivating story of a man who is unlikely ever to be paralleled.It puts across the perfectly the way in which the mathematical community is one big, happy family. All working together to better man kinds knowledge of math and the way it all fits together. The SF himself would find this impossible to put down!"
2,Wasn't quite what I expected.,"I was looking for more baseball bloopers. Broken bats, bad catches, good catches over walls, charging the mound, kind of stuff.This video however started off as a prank reporter / pie in face type of video. It ended up throwing in some baseball related bloopers mixed in with other sports."
3,best if it sits there - not the best for jogging,"Not bad, pretty good performance for the price. The top/lid/cover or whatever you call it sometimes opens by itself if you move the unit about - the latch doesn't seem to be that robust. It is quite amazingly lightweight for a cd player."
2,Manufacturing or Design Problem,"When the dust collector was turned on, it sounded like metal hitting on metal, something hitting the cover. Had to return it. Amazon's customer service is wonderful. It was probably just a problem related to this particular piece of equipment. I bought it as a gift for my husband, and he was disappointed that we had to return it."
4,Asian Wraps,"Being a novice on the topic of asian wraps, I wanted to find a cookbook that was simple, well written and not costly, and I found all of the above in Nina Simonds ""Asian Wraps"". This cookbook is well written, the recipes are easy to understand, and the cost was very reasonable. I would recommend this cookbook to any of my family or friends who wish to add versatality to their menu's."
3,Karl Largerfeld Photo,"Nice smell, but not very distinctive. Smells like a few other colognes I got for my hubby; but still smelled nice."
2,Good music-bad performances,"I love J.S. Bach's organ music--which is why I bought this CD--but I don't like many of these recordings. The main performer plays pieces slow, and even so cannot maintain a tempo as he should. Both me and my former piano teacher feel that there are many better performances of Bach's organ music available for purchase."
1,hate it,I hated this product ... it was terrible tasting and left me gassy all day long. Only took it for a couple days but that was enough!!!
2,The cello sounds so ugly...,"I have other records with Tim Hugh, which I do not dislike at all. Therefore, and also considering the low-price, I will not rate this record as severely as I am tempted to do.There are two major problems with this CD. First, why, if Naxos is desperate about producing, over time, the ""complete works"" of all major composers, not selecting Maria Kliegel instead of Hugh for this particular one; the comparison with Rostropovich (re-edited, at low price, a few years ago... this is the original and still best interpretation... of the first two suites, at least... I don't have the third) would prove less detrimental to Naxos. Second, intrinsically, the cello sounds so rasp that is it difficult - if you have not heard others play these works - to even apprehend that Britten's cello suites are masterpieces. I strongly advise to run away from this record..."
1,Simply Doesn't Work,"I bought this pump to help drain a flooded basement, but could not get it to work no matter what I did. I called Simer tech support and tried a few of their suggestions. Still no luck.I tried shorter discharge hoses (even no hose!), shorter extension cords (even plugged it right into the wall), and different depths of water. Every time the pump would switch on for 4 seconds, pump a little water out of the hose, then stop. Back on for a few seconds, then off. A few minutes later it would start the cycle again. To be fair, for the few seconds it worked, it pumped very well.According to the technician I spoke to, the pump senses when water is present or not based upon the electrical flow to the unit (which is why he suggested trying a shorter extension cord). It seems checking amperage isn't a very reliable method.I'm taking it back to the store.It's a real shame. My dad has a couple of Simers from the 80's that run like champs."
3,"Good movie, but....","For a movie that was well praised by critics, I was sort of expecting more. Not that it was bad or anything, but the story was predictable, and nothing in it was surprising.I generally agree that Denzel Washington's acting was good, but at times, I felt his character remained aloof. In the end, I didn't warm up to Rubin Carter as a person, but was I supposed to?Basically, the movie is a good portrayal of Rubin Carter, his career, his incarceration, chronicling how his Canadian friends stayed by his side and helped freed him. I seem to not have much to say about the movie ... perhaps that says enough, I liked it, but didn't think it was that great."
5,The story that impressed me much...,"I saw the movie by Norman Jewison and i have different feelings! I never knew that life can be so cruel& sudden! I was suprised! I felt pain when Rubin was taken into prison...And felt happiness and joy when he met his canadian friends!The final of the movie was unexpected. To my mind,""The Hurricane"" is a brilliant,splendid and it's very deep in ideas , thoughts.It's intense,heartfelt,serious.After watching the movie i want to read a book by Rubin Carter""The Sixteenth Round""!!!!!"
4,The Hurricane,"I believe this is really a great movie and it was a true story as it was told.I watched it and yaped it on a VHS,but I have to admit it better on DVD.It is a movie that keeps your attention through out the complete movie."
1,A lot of hot air,"I went to see this movie because I thought it would be interesting. As I learned earlier this movie is based on a true story about the true Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter and how he was framed for shooting some guy. I also think that he was wrongfully accused and shouldn't have been arrested. I think that this movie is even more boring than the pokemon movie. I went to see ""The Cider House Rules"" it is WAY better than ""The Hurricane"". I think that the elderly would enjoy this movie the most because they actually remember this event in time. Another Group of people that would enjoy this movie would be the young because of its message to tell little kids not to do what the actual Hurricane did."
4,Strong Film Speaks Volumes,"I thought this movie started out slow. It took a while to grab my interest. Midway through, I was hooked. This story speaks to strength of character and the human spirit, stronger than any film I have viewed in a very long time. There were a few loose ends I would have liked to have seen tied up, but overall, a movie I would highly recommend. A good example that we can ALL reach out to others and have an impact on their lives."
1,Bad Bad Product,I do not recommend..minimal air supply only to lower part..no air for back. The side elastic straps come lose after a few weeks and have to be replaced.
1,No AC supply,"Although the title says you can plug it into the wall, I received no adapter for this. As I was only buying this for office use, it is unusable. I bought a $35 adapter at Radio Shack, and it still will not work, though when testing it in the car, it works. ARGH!"
2,"Awful, but unique for its time","When this film came out in '86, I was deeply disappointed, but grateful that Hollywood was at least paying SOME kind of tribute to punk rock.Despite the ugliness and stupidity of this witless drivel, it was unique seeing actors play people I had idolized for almost a decade. And the costumes and a few of the period details were well reconstructed. But in all honesty, I can't recommend this to anyone who could just buy the albums and have their own wannabe fantasies."
4,What Punk Became,"This is a brilliant work. No other movie I have ever seen comes close to accurately portraying the chaos and energy of the punk scene, and few movies hit and smack you into the realisation of how a junkie lives. The only other thing that comes close is Trainspotting. Gary Oldman yet again delivers an undefeatable and unforgettable performance. Oldman and Webb's talent grabs you by the bollocks, and never lets go! Though, a few historical inaccuracies exist (e.g. the mohawk guys at the Sex Pistols gig at the beginning. Mohawks weren't prevalent in punk til' early 80s), the acting, and the portrayal of Sid and Nancy's downfall will overcome any gripe a person might have. Joe Strummer and The Pogues additions to the soundtrack make the images haunt your mind. An A+! Incredible movie!"
5,"wonderful,","i really hate the sex pistols too! they are the worst punk band on earth, but i love sid's albums cause they are so raunchy and unorganized, the sex pistols studio albums where just flat and lame. this is great film making, webb and gary's performances are outstanding. yeah, courtney love is the film, for about 50 seconds. the only thing that makes no sense at all is when sid is getting his butt kicked by redneck bikers and his manager puts his hand in the shape of a gun like a kid would and the bikers run like its a real gun, he then aims his deadly finger at the ground fires a bullet! you must see this movie atleast once. the last scenes are the best."
2,WHINE WHINE WHINE WHINE WHINE WHINE WHINE,I stupidly purchased this DVD on Ebay. The only astonishing thing about this movie was how much weight Gary Oldman lost to play the part. Nancy (Chloe something or other) was absolutely terrible. She whined her way through the movie putting my teeth on edge. I thought Gary's acting was up to par and quite believable but this Nancy girl was a joke. And my head was spinning with questions such as where does a heroin addict such as Nancy afford to buy leather clothes and have her hair perfectly coiffed in each shot. They nearly burn down their hotel room yet the manager shoves them downstairs and still lets them stay. Where was Sid's managers/PR's??????? He was 'SID VICIOUS'.....He was someone. Why didn't he have a minder except for that whining girlfriend. Okay...I'm done.
2,"cute, though inaccurate.","It was a cute movie and Gary Oldman's performance was splendid, though the character felt somewhat empty--more out of bad writing than bad acting. And Johnny Rotten.. he was portrayed as absolutely dull, unenthusiastic, and lacked any and all of what made him awesome. There was none of the attitude or charisma, and his overall demeanor was terribly unappealing. Even the stage performances felt forced and lazy. This aspect disappointed me the most. It was as though he didn't even try. But if you can ignore the inaccuracies and emptiness of spirit it's a pretty decent movie, as an idealistic fantasy surrounding the tragic relationship between Sid and Nancy. I guess that's just to be expected when the movie is created without actually consulting anyone that really knew the people being portrayed. ;]"
1,Sid and yuck,this was one of the most horrible movies i've seen. this movie was dumb. i can't say much more than don't waste your time. i say the acting was bad. The only good thing in this movie was the music and i have to say it is bad when the soundtrack is better than the film.
3,Too much background information,"I wish the dvd had been mostly his songs, but it came across as a history of Elvis. Too much background and not enough singing."
1,This is a bestselling book???,"I read this book based on the ""best-seller"" status combined with good reviews on-line. What a joke. I was embarrassed for this author! Forget the lack of plot depth, etc. the writing is just plain terrible. She's trying so hard to write 'believable' characters and how they would talk, etc. but it comes out as just plain ridiculous. And her attempts at ""witty"" or ""comedic"" dialogue is again just embarrassing. I haven't read her other books - I hope they are better than this one. Waster of time."
4,Good Book,"I discovered Lisa Scottoline this year and have been devouring these books ever since! I love her writing style. Having lived in Philadelphia for 18 years, I particularly enjoy the references to this great city. South Philly is one of my favorite places. The unique vibe of that part of the city is wonderful! I enjoyed getting to know Bennie Rosato. Mary DiNunzio is my favorite of the lawyers and her view of Bennie is one of intimidation. It was neat to read what was behind the character of this strong woman."
4,Music in smiles,"This is a wonderful album from the self-acknowledged eccentric and eclectic musician who was in part responsible for bringing summer into English music and the head spaces of those who participated in the 70's carnival atmosphere. Those critics who use labels such as 'inconsistent' are seeking regularities which Ayers and others perhaps consciously ignored. This album speaks volumes for the craft and talent of the likes of Kevin Ayers, Mike Oldfield and David Bedford. Stranger in Blue Suede Shoes remains one of the best songs to come from the rich catalogue of Kevin Ayers. The other tracks bring texture and warmth, anticipation and drama. It is a shame that Joy of a Toy is no longer available. Whatevershebringswesing has to be the perfect alternative. Beg, borrow or steal."
3,A Last Gasp Of Hippiedom,"I like Kevin Ayers. Not much of a voice, and his songs are pretty simple, but he has charm. Kind of boozy and woozy. I actually think his songs on the Cale-Eno-Nico-Ayers live set ""June 1, 1974"" are the best songs. ""Stranger In Blue Suede Shoes,"" track six here, is quite likely the only Kevin Ayers song you need be familiar with. I too do not agree with the amazon review person that ""Stranger"" is sub-Velvet Underground. It's kind of like John Cale imitating Ray Davies or something. Anyway, it's a good song. But ""whatevershebrings..."" is not well-produced; in fact, it sounds pretty dated. But, like I said, I like Kevin Ayers and this is a charming effort despite its flaws. If we can venerate Nick Drake we ought to at least leave the door open for Kevin Ayers to come in a have a drink on us."
1,WASTE OF MONEY - get Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"This is a poor knock-off of the classic book ""Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain"" by Betty Edwards. Save your money and go back to the original! And if you are a painter, try the new book she has written, called, simply, COLOR. It's fabulous"
2,superficiality,"I love books and books about books, but this one disappoint me: the lack of depth is disgusting ...the miss and errors are no longer acceptable."
2,Nancy Pearl is lovely,Book should be used for reference only. Each genre is so brief that any continuation of thought for any subject is abruptly ended. However it does give a very good source for selection of books which I have not read. It covers the whole spectrum of book categories so I found interest in only about 25% of the listings. If I live to be 125 and am not too demented I might read all the books she reviews. But for now I concentrate only on a few of the categories. Science Fiction and Mystery / Thrillers were the only two sections which really held my interest enough to search out the authors and the books on [...]
1,Poor anti-Catholic attempt,"As a Catholic apologist I found Swaggart's attempt to find error in the Catholic Church poor. Writing based off misconceptions laid by his forerunner, Boettner, Swaggart continues to perpetuate lies and misconceptions about Catholic doctrine and manages to sufficently defend heresy in the Catholic Church which does not exist. Catholics do not worship Mary, sacrifice Christ in the mass, or so forth. Fundamentalists can do themselves a favor and avoid such authors as Swaggart, McCarthy, Boettner, Brewer, Chick, and Rivera, for more scholarly works. None of these common anti-Catholic authors understand the Catholic Church and thus it is useless and fruitless to use thier works as an authority on the Catholic Church. Their best bet is to stick with authors who explain thier faith such as Calvin, and then look to Catholic authors who explain the Catholic faith such as Keating, Ott, Hahn, Ray, Sugnesis, Waiss, Mork, or others and compare the two."
1,Swaggart is also a plagiarist.,"I read this book, here in Brazil, almost 20 years ago.In fact, I never finished it.I returned it to the owner.I became interest in Jimmy Swaggart only after the sexual scandal.Swaggart was not only unmoral, womanizer, hipocrite, liar, demagogue, ridiculous, ridiculous.He is also a plagiarist and an anti-catholic bigot.If you don't believe, read this book.Basically all of it is a plagiarism from the book ""Roman Catholicism"" by Loraine Boettner(1901-1990).I read one and the other.Boettner and Swaggart are both anti-catholic bigots and liars.Swaggart wrote this book deeply rooted in Loraine's book.He many times, wrotes the same lies.A clear plagiarism.I don't want nobody reading this fraud.If someone loves anti-catholic bigotry, then read ""Roman Catholicism"" by Loraine Boettner or ""The Great Controversy"" by Ellen G. White(also a plagiarist, such as Swaggart)."
3,Bread Mix,I found the bread mix very easy to use. I've tried it in our bread machine and also in the oven. Each time the loaves turned out beautifully and my family just loved it. You certainly made a new customer.
5,Yummy!,"This was the first bread we made in our new bread maker and even before it was done, the kitchen smelled sooooo good.This bread is really delicious. Not sure why this is called ""European"", since I don't recall having bread this good when I lived over there.Anyways - this is very tasty!"
2,Not good,Easy to make and comes with all the ingredients including the yeast. I didn't like this bread at all. It tasted way too much like rosemary. I gave away the other five boxes and no one else seemed to like it either.
5,Great Bread Mix,this is a great bread mix. one of the few mixes i've used where the season doesn't overpower the flavor of the bread. i will be re-ordering this bread mix often
4,Slightly bland flavor,"I like the ease of use and texture of finished product; however, I'd like alittle more flavor from the cheese and herbs."
4,A treat for the ears,"If you are a fan of Autechre's Amber album, then you are in for a real treat. This EP is composed of 4 tracks made in the same vein as Amber's music. Tracks 1 through 3 are cool and sleek ambient vibes with rythm, while track 4, is my favorite track on here. The song just leaves you in this empty void of feeling alone and hopeless. This is a must have if you dig Autechre's Amber album."
2,Leaky air cushion,"I received the booster seat last Saturday and installed it that day. Took the dog for a ride on Saturday and Sunday. Notice on Sunday that the cushion was almost completely flat. Blew it up again and check it a few hours later, was halfway flat. I contacted the supplier. They are shipping me out a new booster seat. Hopefully this one will not leak."
4,Well Made and Easy to Use,"This is a well made and easy to use product. It sets up in seconds and can be removed in the same. Because of this, it makes it more likely to be used. The dog is elevated to a height of clear vision out the windows reducing stress and likelihood of car sickness. I don't know how well it would work for bigger dogs but my 9 pound Yorkie likes the seat."
2,Tiresome,"I met this man years ago through family friendship. I thought I would enjoy reading his story since I was young when I actually met him. The book became tiresome of extravagant and detailed descriptions of a privileged lifestyle that most people cannot imagine let alone relate to along with the constant undertones of being ""wronged"" all his life. Although it is sad that his family was denied by the Fords, why would they promote an illegitimate relationship involving years with a family that was not legally part of theirs?"
2,Format not content,I have not yet read the book but must say that I am very disappointed with the format. The book is smaller than a normal paperback. The print is tiny and cramped and the margin on the binding side is so small that it is certain to come apart when opened. It is not worth the money paid and I shall certainly not order another book printed by the publisher in question.The Saint: The Saint and Mr. Teal
4,A pleasant surprise...for the price!,"This a good quality recording of the complete set of Bach's motets. The Scholars Baroque Ensemble does a wonderful job with small forces of fewer than 10, often with one singer per part. A real showcase for the singers' virtuosity. The German diction is quite good, and the interpretations are lively, although some of the ritards at cadences are a bit much. Overall, a real find."
4,jxn reader,"This book seems helpful to me, putting into an easiy readable form a huge amount of information about making nonprofit organizations work well."
5,"Excellent, High-Energy, Well-Mixed","This was my first exposure to Tunnel Trance and I was very pleased. I bought it mainly for Klubbheads' ""Let The Party Begin"". The tracks flow well and are varied enough to maintain interest without causing fatigue. Great for cruising or dancing!"
4,State of Africa,"'The State if Africa' is an extremely detailed account of African politics in the last 50 years. It looks at the whole continent in a roughly chronological order and has some wonderful photo plates to illustrate the various 'dictators' and issues explored. I found some chapters more engaging than others and these provided explanation of key events in good detail to provide an in-depth understanding. Other chapters sadly were bogged down in acronyms and detail that only true African scholars would find of interest (hence the 4 stars). Overall, this is a well researched and presented introduction to post independence Africa that sadly leaves you feeling not a great deal has changed and that this is a continent left ravaged by tyranny and corruption. Not a particularly positive book, but an in-depth and well articulated one.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,CHAOS BUILT ON SUFFERING,"Meredith's book lives up to its hype as the essential primer for anyone attempting to understand the hugely disparate and complex historical and social tapestry of the Dark Continent. While focusing with great intensity on the horrific and predatory self-governance that has haunted African nations since gaining independence from their European colonial masters, Meredith also reveals an underlying empathy and even respect for the long-suffering people and their ability to endure hardships seemingly beyond their control. The book is an interesting historical read made all the more so with Meredith's gripping prose and marvelous organizational thought process."
1,Horrible,I love Bone but I don't get peoples reviews sometimes. But This cd should remain rare so it wont make your ears bleed. This is such a horrible cd.
5,A story that draws you in...,"""This is a gritty and highly original tale of survival in North America in the 1820s, complete with wonderful characters in the form of man and beast."""
1,Does NOT fit fuel injected engines!!!,"The web site does not specify which type engines this works with, yet the packaging has written on the back""NOT for use with fuel injected engines"", which eliminates the last 20 years of cars.Amazon needs to list this in the ad so others do not have to return it as I did."
5,Potato Baking Nails Set of 4,Take the mystery out of having the perfect baked potato at home. This is simple and it works perfectly. Just as good as a fine restaurant.
2,Don't buy if you're looking to connect to an IPOD,"What they don't tell you on here is that the iPod adapter is the stereo headset type that only works with two iPod models, the iPod 5th generation and the iPod Photo. The rest use the proprietary iPod connector at the base of the ipod. I'm sure you can buy an adapter for it, but it should be stated in the product description. After buying the product it's not stated anywhere in the directions either, only to connect the ""iPod type AV cable"" into the iPod for video out. I had to search around to find out that the iPOD classic, the iPod touch and the iPhone do not support this type of cable. You'll need an iPod connector type (at the bottom of the iPod) to the stereo headphone type. Check it out at http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=300233"
1,Do not believe the size listed!,"This product is not ""As Advertised"". I was looking for a larger dust hood to help with the dust collection at my miter saw. The Product Specifications AND the Product Details list this item as 33' long, 19"" wide & 26.5"" height. Sounded perfect for my needs. NOT SO! The hood is just a regular larger hood available in all the woodworker catalogues. Do not purchase this unless you are looking for the standard hood."
5,Good western,"Westerns are my favorite, good movie. Charles Bronson one of my favorite actors. Good action movie to watch on a rainy day"
4,There `s a lot of action,"A sharp script conforms a stupendous Western thriller when a mysterious prisoner who hates any kind of violence is carried I a train with other intriguing characters. Some unnatural deaths occur and an unexpected gun shot will make you to pay full attention in this curious but smart movie.Passable picture., but never a classic."
3,A Romance Single Mom's Can Relate To!,"Allie Ooop was a delight. I read it before the weekend was over. It was funny! I would of rated the book five stars, had it been longer. However, I primarily read novella's being I don't have a lot of time to myself. I'll be watching the author to see what she come out with next!"
2,Not a total loss,"I bought these for my son and I. He was a little too young for the better 22 channel walkies so I thought because of other reviews that it was worth the $12. Was I wrong, unless we are within 7 feet of eachother and there are no walls in between us, they do not work. What is the point of 7 feet. Anyway, the reason it wasn't a total loss is because my son just runs around pretending he is on the radio with me and loves it."
2,rating walkie talkies,We were very excited about these walkie talkies but after using them we were disappointed. Unless you are in direct line of the both walkie talkies they do not work. The girls never play with them and they play spy all the time.
1,the usual,"recycled [material]Apparently playboy expects everyone to buy the same footage 5 different times.Also, the cameos by the earlier, natural breasted playmates are so much sexier than the ""featured"" barbie doll playmates with basketballs glued to their chests, it makes you wish the whole video could just be old playmates.Shauna Sand and Carrie Stevens are the only good ones, and the Shauna footage I know is straight from her other video."
4,some historical background on today's events,"Written over 40 years ago, the essays in this book take on a certain new relevancy, given recent events in the Middle East. The book's authors describe the largely European, Christian rationales for the Crusades. And go into the politicking in Europe that led to the launching of these. There is relatively little here from the Arab, Muslim vantage. And a bit of glossing over of the rampaging destruction that was visited on the Muslim states. Or even on the fellow Christians in the Byzantine Empire. Who were the unfortunate hosts of several Crusades.Still, if you want some historical perspective to today's events, the book is a decent read."
3,Clink. Fzzz. Whppp.,"Lots of very Aphex Twin-esque tunes, but with intricately-produced rhythm tracks utilising lots of cut-up, 8-bit samples. And that's 'Chiastic Slide', really. It's very measured and modern, and impeccably tasteful to cite as an influence and / or inspiration, but often quite dull as music once past the initial novelty of the production. Such is their image, it's annoyingly impossible to criticise without appearing to be a real-ale drinking musical philistine, too. Nice packaging, though. I hear they got better, however, as time went on."
2,Troubling,"Autechre really baffle me. They are talented, this much I know. What is the problem though? Music is a mass medium with a wide audience. When you are a musician, or team of musicians, you have some kind of responsibility to people to repay the time and attention they give to listening to something, or watching it, or reading it. I don't know if there is anything of that nature to speak of here. I don't know what this is, frankly. It is not music. The sounds are fascinating, but Autechre has always been about these amazing sounds they create. But what is this that has been collected. I am baffled, period. Possibly it is so ahead of its time, or I am just a fool. I don't know, but I cannot imagine the appeal of Autechre anymore. This is like music for your computer, for a robot without a thinking mind, only a calculating one."
4,Brings me back,"Back in 1993, I was introduced to th' Healers when they opened for the Breeders and Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. I was immediately drawn to the teasing vocals by Roxanne and the crunchy, semi-drone, inverted bluesy guitar lines that would lull you into a fog before crashing over you in a wall of sound. I ran out and bought both Lido and Imaginary Friend, and spread them around my dorm like a rampant case of mono. The discs made their way gradually to the bottom of my stack, always eluding the ""to sell"" pile, when I'd flip them back into the CD rotation and realize how unique they still sounded 5 years, 10 years and now almost 15 years later. This collection puts together some of the best work and throws in a couple of excellent covers for good measure. I especially enjoy their version of (of all things!) ABBA's ""S.O.S."" It sounds like it was meant to rock."
1,Big Disappointment,"As a Retired Electrical Engineer, I had replaced the batteries in my Cordless Telephone once before. The original and first-replacement batteries lasted about six years apiece. These lasted two days. The word on the street is that cheap Chinese batteries don't last after being discharged -- they become ""Bricks"" (useless). So I bought a new Cordless Set with AA-size rechargable batteries -- to widen the sources of supply.Lenmar CB0105 Battery for Panasonic Cordless Phones"
5,A lovely friendship between a malamute and a bear cub,I got this movie a year ago and I have already watched it about 40 times! It caught my eye because I have an obsession with Malamutes and this is the first movie I've seen with a malamute as the main star! This movie is about Nikki a malamute and Neewah a bear cub. Watch as Nikki and Neewah go through funny and moving adventures I really recomend this movie!
5,"""My sanitized memories""","""My sanitized memories""As Lieutenant Colonel Otto Skorzeny wrote on his own memories, after the war it was a very good idea to announce that you had been a dissident and an opponent against the regime of Adolf Hitler, and that maybe, Alber Speer was forced to write down those passages where he mentioned his plot to gas(!) the bunker of Hitler. Skorzeny expressed his derision and disbelief because he knew Speer and the impression he got, from Speer, was that of a commited man and of one who believed in the Third Reich and who was loyal to Hitler too.Apart from the the written above this book is an execelent account of the war from the Nazi point of view and I highly recommend it."
5,Revealing Historical Info,"The Author who was in Hitlers inner circle states that he believes his account is ""Honest""Much of the account details events before and during WWII as well as the Authors personalinteraction with Hitler that presents Hitler in Person and many of the circumstances thatinfluenced Hitlers decisions and Hitlers ideas that were truly shocking not usually related inother WWII Historical accounts.The underlying message of Mr.Speers writing that is not contained within the context of the written format is the consequences of Political Corruption that can be exploited by anyone with enough determination to pursue political means and the power that can be manipulated to any deviant and destructive inventions."
5,A testament of real human dignity and honesty.,"In a word, Albert Speer could only be discribed as ""genious"" true organizational genious! Albert Speer the man who made it possible to extend the war after it had been effectivly lost, casts an honest eye back on thoes horrable years. Striking detailes of his years as Hitlers personal archetect and later as Reichminister of armaments and war production flaunt the pages. An outstanding display of dignity and honesty from the man who might very well have single handedly saved Germany, by countermanding Hitlers scorched earth policy, running the very real risk of summery exacution. Displaying his genious again through his undoubted elegance and intellegence, preseanted a brilliant defence at the nuremberg war crimes tryal. Eluding an almost cirtin death sentence"
4,nick joaquin rules,"what can i say. i am a fan of nick joaquin. i guess my review of the man's work is biased. in my opinion, he is a great story teller, because he can present the essays as if he was right there at the moment these events occurred. i dont know how he does his research but they sound credible."
4,Good book between theory and practice,A useful book on pattern based development. It is a bridge between the definitive and (not quite accessable) Gang of Four book and the (very accessable ) Head First Patterns. The previous titles are great on theory but not very good on practical applications. Design Patterns Explained covers the use of patterns as applied to real world problems like an e-commerce system. The examples are relevant and the books purpose is to teach. Each chapter has questions and exercises designed to make you think.It is a useful book that balances the other titles on the shelves. It has served me well when I needed a semi realistic and current exmaple of a pattern in use.
2,This IS NOT the book to buy to learn about Design Patterns,If you're trying to learn about how Design Patterns work this is NOT the book to buy. When there were few books out on design patterns I could almost justify getting this book but now with so many books out there that explain what Knuth et al were getting at I couldn't recommend this book.
5,Best book for learning Object Oriented analyse and design with design patterns,I read many books about software analyse and design in Object Oriented but this book show me the right way easily. Alan Shalloway in this book show you a new way for analysis of problem domain and you find why and how using any design patterns in your design.
4,Glorious but unnecessary repackage,"Fans already know that Aimee Mann is a rare bird as a songwriter and that Lost In Space is a terrific record running a bare step behind her superb Bachelor #2. Therefore, I'll limit my comments to the repackage itself. If you don't already own the album, this is the way to get it, but if you bought the earlier limited release, you have the right to be a mite annoyed. The book-style package of this ""new"" Lost In Space is attractively sturdy but simply upgrades the original comic/lyric booklet into a heavy cardboard format and includes no new pictures or information. The second disc is a fine live set with 2 new studio tracks plus the 2 rare cuts that filled out the bonus single from the first version. Therefore, the new disc released by itself would have made a perfect website offering for fans who didn't want to buy the whole thing again."
4,Flex-a-lite 282 in 2004 Suburban,"Unit delivered in record time! Wow, seems like I hit the enter key and then soon after the delivery service left it at the front door. Unit had some pre assembly required, which could of been done by manufacturer, like wiring and stat control mounting. Fans went in very easily, however stat control failed to work and manufacturer quickly sent out a replacement within two days after call to tech support.Noticable gains in power to the rear wheels and much quieter operation at idle during cold mornings."
2,Fair at most.,"I used to love eating butter with everything until my dad had heart surgery and therefore, we only cook and eat food with butter substitute. I do feel that the food taste the same with or without butter buds. I often end up using more than the recipe requires just to get a hint of the taste. I am not saying this is terrible as it does provide some flavoring after using a lot of product but I wish it was better. However, I am quite pleased that there is no fat or cholesterol regardless of however much I use which is something that real butter or almost all butter imitations can never achieve. My advice: use it if you absolutely must (such as in the case of my dad) but don't expect the same flavor as butter because there is slight taste to these which is nowhere near the real taste of butter."
4,"Tragic, superb, powerful.","By definition, a novel of the end of the Roman Empire is going to have a sad ending (unless, of course, you are one of the Barbarians who didn't die in droves, in which case, it's all a matter of perspective). The story and writing, with all of the grim foreshadowing, makes this a great journey to land at a tragic, but honorable ending. If you are a fan of heroic sacrifice, like the Alamo, the 300 Spartans, etc., this is a very good choice for you."
5,Incredible,"After reading more historical fiction than I can count, most dealing with similar time periods and war-like settings....I have to say, this book is easily in my top 5 along with Gates of Fire, and a few others. I was surpised, but based on other user reviews was confident that it would be good...I didn't realize it would be this good. The characters, scenes, battles and emotions are brilliantly portrayed, each line crisp and the pace quick, but not so fast that you get ahead of yourself. If you are into historical fiction of this type....read this book!!"
2,I wish I could get my money back.,This book I bought a year ago. It's very confusing. The reviews are written for people who already know the subjects. I have sat down many times to study this book. The only thing I gained from this book is frustation.I recently have been studying Barron's How to Prepare for the GED test edition 11. This book is broken down more completely. Very easy to understand. Former GED instructors and Adult education teachers are behind this book.
5,"Missing ChiChi's, but Amazon to the rescue","Chi Chi's was my all time favorite restaurant and I am still going through withdrawals. The only hope that I had left was that i was able to buy the taco seasoning in the store, and still try to create the ChiChi's taste in my own kitchen. Than all of a sudden i could no longer find the taco seasoning in the grocery stores. I was devastated. While looking on line trying to find any stores/anywhere that sold the seasoning, I learned that I could get it from Amazon, in which I already ordered from often. I was elated. I ordered a whole case of 24 packages and will soon be ordering more.The ChiChi's taco seasoning (restaurante) is not a red tomato base seasoning, but a tasty garlic and onion taste (if you liked the ChiChi's food you'll remember how there tacos and (meat) was seasoned). Excellent taste!!! Thanks Amazon for coming to the rescue!!! Please don't ever stop selling the BEST taco seasoning around!!"
2,"Nice, but the rest of the album sounds like elevator music","I don't doubt for a minute that these youg women had their eyes on stardom. But, they picked the wrong producer for their talents. The result is this album, in which the only song worth listining to the the first one, Popsicles and Icicles. The rest are songs that are forgettable,and really do sound like elevator music.Buy the Ultimate Petula Clark CD , not this!"
4,A Good Read,"It's nice to read a good love story, and this book has several. I especially liked the pictures that accompanied the stories."
2,"""little"" really meant little","Surprisingly small--like the little ornament books you hang on your Christmas tree. Good illustration and concise word explanation, though. I felt the cost was not a good value, though if you just wanted an introduction to sign language in order to decide whether to pursue it more fully, it serves its purpose."
1,MOM DAD AND HER,THIS VIDEO WAS OF POOR QUALITY. iT WOULD NOT PLAY PROPERLY YOU CAN ONLY SEE PARTS OF THE SHOW. i AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE DVD. CAROLYN SMITH
5,"Finally, something unbelievable, from beginning to end.","It has been a long time since I cranked a disc form beginning to end like this. Solid, dark, deep, creepy and perfect for my mood. I am a NIN, A Perfect Circle, Godsmack fan. This record is unbelievable....."
1,He must have just needed money,"....because Eddings probably just should have't written this book. There isn't enough stuff in it to make one book, much less a series. The plot is haphazard, un-exciting, and the characters all blend into each other as essentially a rehash of his characters from other books. If you like Eddings, skip this series and at least retain a good image of the author."
3,Over priced,"This product is way too expensive for the quality. The pull-out tray works fine, but the trash bin is too small for the tray - which makes the bin quite wobbly and unstable."
5,"i love this desk, and it took 5 minutes","for my family to put together for me. they included a wrench and a screwdriver so you need no tools. it looks like nice quality furniture. it does not look anything like the typical cardboard, pressed wood furniture they usually sell at kmart or walmart."
2,Very Late Shipment.,It Almost took 15 days for me get my phone . There are other websites that deliver phones faster .
2,Good Intentions with Unstable OS,"I've had this phone since December 2006. My husband got this for me because of its capability to synchronize wirelessly with our Outlook server. I would not buy this version of the phone, if you intend to use the phone heavily. It's so unstable. I can get by because I'm in the office most of the time with my desktop and office phone.Here are 3 things that annoy me the most about the phone:- I have to reboot the phone 2-3 times a week on average because it would just freeze. Sometimes it comes in clusters where I'm rebooting 3 times a day! It almost always happens when I need to make back-to-back calls and/or when I happen to place a call at the same time it tries to synch with the server. I don't want to have to wait 15 seconds between the calls.- I haven't figured out how to silence the phone, if I don't want to pick it up at the moment. Even when press the button intended for this purpose, it takes a while (8 seconds) for the phone to be silenced."
1,Terrible Phone,"If you buy this phone you will be sorry. I've exchanged the phone 3 times. Finally I asked for a refund. I just want my old phone back. Told, ""no refund is possible"". Verizon has lost a devoted customer for the past 4 years. DO NOT TAKE a chance on this phone. Especially if needed for business like me."
2,"Great Palm devise, but terrible email and not user friendly","I had a Blackberry and was comfortable with its instant ""always on"" email. Emails would arrive on my handheld simultaneously as when they'd arrive on my desktop. I swithed for the high speed internet and the promise of a better calendar and contacts. As promised, the internet is much better than the 1x technology. Don't expect broadband, but it is usable. Also, the contacts and calendar sections are easy to use. As a phone, the 700w works just fine. I like the speakerphone and blue tooth features.Configures wireless sync is torture. I have spent literally tens of hours trying to get it to work correctly. To this day it can take half a day for an email to arrive on my Treo. If I had to do all over again I would look either at a newer generation Blackberry or at the Motorola Q."
2,looked good on paper - junk in real life,"bought this phone 6 weeks ago direct from Verizon, I just received my 4th replacement and it still has problems. First unit crashed, second unit had a dead keyboard right out of the box, in the third and fourth units the modem won't hang up automatically so if you use it to automatically check e-mail it will stay logged on until you remember to turn it off. Tends to block calls and burns up battery. When the phone does work, it is very slow. I could tolerate that if it was stable.I am trying to get my money back from Verizon."
5,Lots of features for the price!,"I just got this phone from palm.com and have not stop using it since activation. First upgrade I did was add a 4gb sd card from Transcend because my old Treo 650 didn't even hack over 2gb of data. So for those who needed more memory for their Treo 650, look no more, the 700 can go beyond and more! That's not it tho. One of my favorite feature of the phone is streaming. This thing had my video ipod at hello! Because of Verizon's broadband, you can listen/watch music and video. Watch live TV. You can even record and DL music to your memory card. Voice reconigtion is another feature I love about this phone. You can say ""play video"" or ""play audio"" or ""call Jill on cell phone"". So far I have no problems with the phone and I had it for about a week. There's no doubt this might be the best pda phone out yet to date....until the motorola q comes out."
2,"Great Conception, Poor Implementation","This phone is just a bad product. It's really too bad too as it's one of the better form factors out there for smart phones.The phone locks up on me about twice per week. I have to remove the battery and put it back in so the phone does a hard restart to get it working again. I have installed no third party software to cause this problem.It's nearly impossible to pull this phone out of a holster without hitting one of the side buttons.The keys stick out too far. I'll remove it from its holder just to realize that while I've been carrying it around I've managed to hit the letter ""P"" about a hundred times.The 240x240 resolution on the screen precludes this device from every being able to be upgraded to Windows Mobile 6.0. Windows Mobile 6.0 requires 320x240 resolution at a minimum.Hopefully Palm gets it right with the Treo 800 when it's released. Otherwise, I'll be looking into getting a next generation Motorola Q."
1,Poor Choice for those used to Palm OS Phones,"If you are migrating from a Palm OS based phone, you should be aware that many things that you used to get ""for free"" via the web (such as time tables from airlines) you will now need to get from the web using your airtime data connection. If you don't plan to buy airtime minutes for web/email access for this phone, I would NOT consider buying this phone.This is a point that is sometime missed when considering a Windows based mobile device over a Palm OS phone."
1,outdated,"Thirty years ago this book was a 10 star, but during the last 15 years or so (since the author's death) new research has left it totally outdated, and has proven wrong some of her theories. Her treatment of vegetable oils is especially outdated in light of new research. Instead try The Anti-Aging Zone (good for everyone, not just the aging) and books by Dr. Michael Murray, who is the Adelle Davis of this generation (and then some)."
2,quality should be job 1,"Once installed, the dust collector works as designed. Care needs to be taken upon installation. The snaps are not centered on each side of the dust collector bag so, if you follow the inclosed directions and center the middle snap on each side of the table saw base, the snaps will not line up with the snaps on the bag. Also, upon screwing the snaps into the table saw base, 1 snap stripped and 2 snaps twisted off so the bag is held up with the remaining 9 snaps instead of 12."
1,Mis-representation,"I just received my new Delta Platinum Edition 36-485 table saw and needed someway to collect dust generated by the table saw and was about to buy item DC001. Thanks to the reviews, I learned that this item will not fit my new saw even though the mfg and writeup by Tool Crib would lead you to believe otherwise. This mis-representation should be corrected. There is a need for this type of collection system as the metal chute that comes with the Delta saws is totally unsat for use in a workshop."
5,"I Am The Original ""Sandy""","This album has a very special meaning to me...Larry Hall dated my sister in the late fifties and he use to come to our home and play his songs. This one song he hadn't given a title to was really good and he use to sing it to me. When I asked what he was going to call it he said that he would title it ""Sandy"", after me. Although my sister wasn't too happy, I was thrilled when it became a hit. I never thought he'd get it recorded but one day I heard it on the radio and flipped out. He was a very nice guy and very good looking...my mom even liked him and that's saying something!"
4,Secrert Weapons for the Modern Drummer,"Jojo Mayer is clear in his demonstrations and amazing in his performances. My drumming has improved following his advice. Scientific, using and explaining the physics of the drum and the stick and artist, using theory in servitude to self expression. Excellent."
5,Very Instructive Video From a Fantastic Drummer,"I used to play the drums long, long time ago in high school and part of college, then I did something stupid: I sold them. I've always regretted this and just recently purchased an electronic drum set to catch up on lost time. Being that it is not exactly like riding a bike (the fundamentals come back but overall I feel like a spaz), I decided to relearn everything the right way by getting some drum DVD's and books. Of the several training items I purchased, this one is the best. JoJo is entertaining, extremely talented, and does an excellent job demonstrating what he is trying to teach you. He doesn't zip through anything during the lessons. Plus he has a good sense of humor and is easy to listen to. This is one great instructional DVD and highly recommended. Even for spazzes like me who are relearning how to play."
1,Do Not Purchase,"Without a doubt, this was by far the worst and most disappointing product I've ever had the displeasure of wasting money on. It looks nice and shiny butthe quality of this product is subpar. Like glitter on a turd. The TV is hard to turn on and turn off, the inputs are difficult to reach, the monitor makes noises when it isn't supposed to and that's if you can get this thing to work at all. In effect, all this thing is good for is a paper weight. How did this product ever get to market is beyond me. I would not be surprised if this company went bankrupt. I can't find support services anywhere, and they have no website so I guess that means I'm right. I had to learn the hard way. Next time, I'll invest in a monitor/tv from brand that has been around for awhile instead of these cheap knockoffs."
1,One star - One year,"Died after one year - ABSOLUTELY no luck getting hold of Astar service for any help... Very disappointed, because until it died I thought it was a nice unit. Would be willing to rate higher IF Astar provided any acceptable level of service."
5,"A Perfect, Sturdy Solution for Sorting","Our family has grown by one in the last year. There was too much laundry floating in and out of rooms in our small house. I was looking for something that was sturdy for hauling up and down our stairs, that could withstand damp washcloths and messy baby clothes, and was squared off and compact... these things are PERFECT. I bought two, and I don't know how we sorted, hauled and stored laundry before. Buy these. They are awesome."
4,Affordable solution to dirty laundry scattered about,"I purchased 2 of these, one for my son's room and another for my daughter. I was surprised by the sturdiness of the hampers. Very pleased with this product. It is light enough that it can be carried downstairs to the laundry, when full. In addition, it folds up rather easy, for times when you want/need it to be out of sight. I highly recommend these to anyone looking for an affordable way to keep clothes off their teenagers floor"
4,Nice Enough for the Money,"These hampers are nice enough. I thought they would be larger than they were. My dog (50 lb lab mix) can still stick her nose into them if they get close to being full and pull clothes out. If they were 6 inches taller she would not be able to do this. In addition, they do bend and once they bend/get a crease they are always creased. When filled to the top, I can get the entire hamper into the wash easily, which is nice. The hampers look nice in my room and look more expensive than they are. Overall, a good product that I would probably buy again."
5,Awesome Hampers - basic and clean,"I bought 2 of these hampers and they are perfect. One for whites and one for the darks wash. They are nice, modern and clean looking so I just have them lined up in my bedroom wall...i am so happy with this purchase"
4,A little bigger than I imagined.,"However, they're good quality. They hold a decent amount of clothes and they stay standing up at all times. I haven't run into any problems yet and because of the material it doesn't really absorb the smell of dirty clothes."
5,Stylish little hamper,"After buying my first house this spring, I knew that my fiancee and I needed a better laundry system than throwing our clothes in the bottom of the closet like previously. I purchased myself this hamper and liked it so much I bought a second (hers and his!). The size is just right (holds about one load of laundry) and it has a nice appearance. The inside is lined with plastic as to make it easier to clean up, which I haven't needed but is appreciated."
5,Perfect fit.,I needed something that would fit in a small closet and this was the perfect size and height. Very light-weight and compact.
4,HANDY,"Very handy product. Was using this hamper in my husbands bathroom, which is also the guest bathroom...very small space...fit very nicely. However since it is in the guest bathroom I ended up buying a different hamper same size different brand that has a lid on it, so guests won't have to look at his underwear and socks :) Now I am using this hamper next to the changing table so when I strip my son down in the morning/evening all his clothes gets put in there and is easy to wash seperate from our clothes. Overall very sturdy and nice looking hamper for the price."
1,Horrible design flaw,I left laundry from the wash cycle in this overnight in the back of my car trunk. The walls of the hamper became as limp as a wet noodle and never regained their form. It feels like the structure of this thing comes from cardboard. The manufacturer cut corners to save money and used a paper product for support when we all know once paper gets wet it's never the same again. The laundry hamper may as well be a bag because the walls that used to maintain its form are now soft.
1,what the,I have 4 of these and was considering another. They are extremely useful. BUT When I bought these in August 07 They were $11.99 each. I found this to be a reasonable price and a good value. $79.99 is absurd. Is this a typo or a multi-pack?? I find no reference to more than one being sold so it is either a major typo or highway robbery. I certainly hope it is the former and will be corrected soon.
5,Perfect for a child's room,I bought this hamper after reading the reviews and was not disappointed. It was cheaper on Amazon than Target and is so great. I holds alot of dirty clothes and still looks nice in our daughter's room. Can't go wrong with this product!
4,good quality,I am very surprised to see this laundry hamper has good quality with its wood like frame and lid. It is a bit heavy but also gives feeling of good quality.
1,Wrong info,"I wanted to make a correction for page 131, there is no George Herbert Lee who was lynched in 1961.You mean Herbert Lee, my grandfather and father of nine, who was shot in 1961 by EW Hurst, but the witness to the shooting was Lewis Allen."
5,Contains Two Very Hard-To-Find Hits By Sunny & The Sunglows/Sunliners,"If you're looking for the Tear Drop Records 1963/64 hits by the Texas-based Chicano group known alternately as Sunny & The Sunglows and Sunny & The Sunliners, I would highly recommend the compilation titled Sunny & The Sunglows - Talk To Me which comes from Sunglow Records and is available through Amazon.This Collectables release covers their 1965 vinyl album on their own Sunglow label which also contains both sides of their fourth and last hit, Peanuts (La Cacahuata) which reached # 64 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in May 1965 b/w The Happy Hippo on Sunglow 107.This is very likely the ONLY place you will find both sides of that hit in CD format."
3,SoSo,"I got a few laughs from this movie, but even after paying 8 bucks for it used, I should have just saved for something else."
3,Pretty Funny Movie,Very off-beat comedy with some hilarious moments kind of remind you of SNL news sketch but a lot raunchier. Fun Movie to watch.
2,america's critic,this was by far dumb!!!! unrated huh another 1 that is pg that says unrated nothing special--- dont waste any time with this just pure spoiled like an onion!!
1,Don't waste your time - don't waste your money,"I bought this movie without researching it first, fully expecting it to live up to the high standard set by the printed edition of the Onion. Boy, was I in for a disappointment. The movie was tedious, repetitive, poorly written, and woodenly acted, and even with a short 80-minute run time, it felt like it had been padded out with filler. Many of the sketches started off with a good setup, but then dragged on far too long and just sort of...petered out at the end, without delivering a good punchline. The sketches were very predictable, and even many of the funnier lines were telegraphed so far in advance that I almost wanted to shout ""Get to it, already!"". Fans of the print edition in particular will find the publication's biting sarcasm conspicuously absent."
1,Low Quality,"Flimsy, top is out of square, takes two hands to open and close the drawers. Also bought the mid cabinet...same problems. Very disappointed. Wish I'd never purchased it."
4,This one's a teaser!,"National Geographic does a wonderful job with beautiful footage of some of their most memorable topics. The sound is clear and the colors vibrant.My children were spellbound...The topics ranged from lions, tigers, apes, insects, whales, mating practices of many animals (10 minutes worth, it seemed. We could have done without that part) sharks, snakes, alligators, explorers, volcanoes, dancers and more.This video excites interest in many topics. Because of time constraints and the quantity of information, it doesn't go into detail. It does, however, give you a sneek peak of several NG videos as each segment is labled according to the video clip it came from. I would suggest watching this video in segments as so much information is presented that it is almost an overload!I have purchased several bargain nature videos and am invariably disappointed with the quality. I would trade all my bargains for two or three of the National Geographic videos. This would be one of them."
5,INCREDIBLE,"This movie will be one of the cults of natural geographic's. The subjects differ from dancers to insects. I think everybody can find something about himself in this dvd. Sound quality and scenes are perfect. Extra features (pictures, cameramen dared movie)are good. This movie must be in all documentary lovers' library."
2,Not what I expected,I didn't realize this DVD is only clips a few minutes in duration from such a wide variety of episodes. Not really useful in a sense but more distracting and jumbled. Some clips are cute or funny but the whole episodes would be of more value in those cases.
3,OK,"When this book arrived it was in very used condition which disappointed me and may have started me out with a poor mind set from the beginning. I wasn't very impressed at the content of the book at all. I had found an encyclopedia at a book store I liked a lot and when I got to the amazon website I couldn't remember which one it was exactly. Well, this was not it. This covers a lot more about the horse breeds then I needed and was very basic when it came to horse care. If you are looking for a good basic horse book this would be good for you."
5,A very good repsention of Mr. Fields work.,"As a teenager me and my Girl freind now my wife always attended Erine Fields dances when he would play the Sky-View dance hall in Duncan, OK in the late 1940s.WE LOVED HIS MUSIC."
2,Something Else To Consider...,"This is a good quality hose and it will replace the worn out hose that came with your shop vac but there is something else to consider. Although this hose will fit into a standard shop vac the accessories that came with your shop vac such as the extension tube, crevice tool, etc. MAY NOT FIT THE OTHER END OF THIS NEW HOSE! only Mr. Nozzles accessories or accessories that use a 1 1/2"" I.D. hose end will fit this hose, and Mr. Nozzle does not have alot of accessories to go with this hose so you may end up with a great hose but a poor nozzle etc. at the end of it."
3,Yes and No,Nice to have the additional length and not have to worry about crimping. You WILL need a reducer for some attachments. Blower feature is nice. Be certain to attach wheels with screws provided.
3,"Great music, not so great arrangements","I really like Yanni's music, but the arrangements are in different key and there is no tempo, yet it is still enterntaining to play his music in my guitar!"
5,keeper,This book is very good for pathology but its very useful in a lot of classes. It contains a lot of good pictures and the information is very thorough.
4,Great Pathology Book,"This book has almost, if not everything you would like to know concerning veterinary pathology. It is huge and a bit bulky and it kind of sucks if you have to carry it with you for every class session, but it definitely holds a lot of interesting information."
2,The product does not merit the price,"As the description notes, this is a 1051 word article. That's very short. For $5.95, you can get a number of actual books on fundraising and anniversaries, milestones. This should be a give-a-way."
1,"If you can't write, hire a writer to help you.","How did this book get published? There isn't one paragraph in the entire book which would have earned a passing grade in any school (any level). Mr. Roth has a great story to tell but lacks the necessary skills to relay it to his reader. From the first passages, he rambles on and on, jumping from topic to topic, unable to maintain a chronological order from one paragraph to the next. There are people who make their living assisting those who have a story to tell by writing it for them. Mr. Roth should have enlisted the aid of a skilled writer to put his thoughts and experiences in a readable format for mass consumption by both Van Halen fans and those who enjoy reading biographies. Instead, he attempted to chronicle his journeys by himself--a disappointment to all who are brave (or foolish) enough to plow through the muddled confusion of this book."
3,"Great music, great guy, average book.","I love the six VH albums with Dave, but this book was a huge disappointment. Read ""Full Moon"" is you want a great Rock Biography."
4,"Eye-opening, but no tell-all.","Hard core VH fans may be dissapointed but Roth tells it like it is, at least from his perspective. Good to hear the other side of the story of the VH-1 Awards fiasco. Ed VH makes it all Dave's problem when it seems that Ed's ego and control-freakism probably derailed (hopefully only temporarily!!) the greatest reunion in rock history! I was in Germany for the '78 Sabbath tour and VH blew them away, Sabbath was nearly booed off the stage after the ""Opening Act"" was through! Hopefully someday cooler heads AND egos will prevail!"
5,ABOUT TIME!!!,"I've waited a long time for this--as I'm sure many other Trower fans have. It's about time one of the greatest rock guitar albums of all time was published in TAB. It's dead on by the way--note for note..challenging..not for beginners. It's a priceless peek into the genius of Robin Trower and his amazing song writing and guitar playing skills, and further proof that he was not a Hendrix rip off artist.... not by a long shot. Now I hope they TAB the ""For Earth Below"" album."
5,Great selection.,"This book says EASY, but it's more for early intermediate--some pieces have several sharps and several flats as opposed to the key of C. However, there are many selections to choose from which are early intermediate. The best part is that the pieces are short--1 or 2 pages. I'm enjoying this book. It keeps my interest in the classics, and I can practice with the hope of being able to play the piece fairly well. I love it."
2,"""Easy"" is Misleading","Many years passed between my last childhood piano lesson and the day ""Easy Piano Classics"" arrived at my door. I still read music well, but discovered only a few pieces to be truly easy. It is safely tucked inside our piano seat for now and I wonder, ""will I remember its whereabouts when I advance to more difficult pieces?"""
2,"Wood is nice, Hardware is crap",The hex head bolts that came with this product were evidently made of aluminum. They stripped after only a couple turns! I ended up going to the hardware store and purchasing 40 new bolts to put the stools together. This seller reimbursed me for this cost but still it was inconvenient. Original hardware was Chinese crap!
1,Incorrect listing and beware of sellers!,"I have nothing to say regarding ""Naruto the Movie"" because I have not been able to watch it yet. The 1-star rating is because this listing is incorrect, it is not a Blu-ray but a DVD. Furthermore, the seller (pbshop) sent me a format of the DVD that is unreadable by my DVD player. This seller is based in the UK so the DVD format 2 so I suspect this is the problem since all of my other DVDs read as a format 1. This DVD format needs to be noted in the product description so that more people don't waste their time and money on it. It should be a safe assumption that purchasing from the US version of the site should have US-compatible versions unless noted otherwise. I will try to purchase a new copy from the listing that reads ""Naruto the Movie: Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow (2009)"" and I suspect that I won't suffer the same problems."
4,Yummy,"A friend gave me a box of this to try in my bread machine. It was very easy to make this bread. And not to mention, the bread was so yummy. All you need is a bread machine, water and this box that has the yeast packet in it already!"
3,Healthy isn't always happy.,"Rather dense bread when made in our Cuisinart bread maker, but good whole wheat bread isn't always light and fluffy!"
2,Not happy,"I've tried many of the Hodgson Mill bread mixes, and this is my least favorite. This mix does not rise the way I'd like a mix like this to rise. At first, I thought maybe I got a bad batch of yeast, so I tried using my own (which I know is good) with the same results. It's almost as dense as a low gluten bread (like the Barley mix), which I was not expecting with this one. Their Caraway Rye mix has the same protein content, but rises much better than this one. I may try it one more time to see if I got a bad batch. To be edited later."
2,Has the receipe changed from last year??? No luck with it this time around..,"I've purchased this mix in years past, and had good luck with it. This year, the entire case I purchased was just off... I followed label directions exactly, and it made loaves half the size as the HM wholesome white mix I also used this year. The flavor was good, it just baked into these odd little cube loaves that looked strange. Anyway, I think I will go with the Wholesome White for all my bread next Holiday Season, as it was perfect everytime."
4,Here's a good read!,"Kate Gillespie is a Homicide cop out to clear her partner Sam Scolari of murdering his wife. Read it in one afternoon and couldnt put it down. Nice dialogue, many witty comments from Kate. A light mystery with a minor romance and several characters to keep you interested. Will look for Robin Burchell again."
1,cheap,Bought this for my brother in law who is a coach. This product looks much better online...very cheap in person.
2,It works but what a hassle,"I read in WOOD magazine that applying some weatherstripping helps to keep the lid on the bucket when in use. It really doesn't do much, esp. when you factor in the big, relatively inflexible shop vac hose, too. So while this separator does in fact, separate the heavy chips from the dust, it's quite a hassle to use."
3,"Great filter, incomplete package","Unmatched combination of filtration and suction. HUGE gripe, and why I did not rate this that highly. Without the HEPA conversion kit..... a whole 5 bucks...this is a paper weight. Why do I have to buy a 5 dollar plastic collar with plastic clip? It should ship with a hundred dollar filter! To add insult to injury, the only seller on Amazon was sold out for a few weeks!"
2,not bad,"i must say, i enjoyed the concept of this story and while it managed to capture my interest for most of the time, it kept losing me due to grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, overdone description of events (i.e. solemnly solemn) and a patchy storyline that almost got it right but not quite. having read huggins's nightbringer i was expecting a whole lot better"
5,Mens Down Parka,"I was very pleased with the quality of this product. It was a gift for my son who has a custom countertop business and works a great deal in the mountains of north Georgia,Tennesee and North Carolina in homes under construction where there is no heating yet. The parka is serving him well. It's a great bargain for the price."
2,Strange Movie....,Very bizzare movie! Not for kids or anyone who is prudish!Can be an erotic movie if you choose to see through the bizzare nature of it.
3,Creepy 80s teen movie,This is a creepy 80s teen movie that I actually enjoyed. But I also must add that I like scary/ horror movies that are considered low budget too! It had a decent plot and some known stars like Richard Roundtree & Elliott Gould. And the teacher & his bro in the movie were too weird lol!
4,fun game,this is a fun game within the super solver series but some of the math gets annoyed. when i played this i also found it to be a bit creepy because the tv robot could sneak up on you. a great game though.
2,"Some interesting information, but needs some polish!!!","There is some interesting information in this book, and I have certainly found it of use. However what I don't like is the evident lack of polish this book underwent prior to publication.What really annoys me more than anything is spelling and grammatical errors. But what makes matters worse is the inaccuracies in the book.In chapter 6 for instance there is reference to a movie file that is not even in the CD-ROM, although its supposed to be. (Activities>Chapter 6>cameramovement.mov)"
3,larger in life,"When I received this watch I was surprised by its size. The picture on Amazon is true to the watches details, but I somehow pictured it smaller than it turned out to be. If you are looking for a thick silver watch then this would be a good watch for you, but if you are searching for a normal sized watch (or if you have delicate wrists) then I would not recommend this watch. Especially because many companies on amazon will charge you a 20% restocking fee, on top of whatever you pay for shipping, if you return the item."
5,Girls want to have fun!,"Over 400 girls flashing on the street and dancing in the bars! Who wouldn't like seeing this? Contains one girl who is unbelievable. Lots of nudity, and lots of fun. Best and wildest of the group."
2,Night Journeys,"Night Journeys was a book for 12 and UP. It should have 2 stars though because in the beginning it needs to have more information about Peter and his life. On how he has no other family, and how he had to give up his horse for his family. Besides that the book was interesting. It had a lot of conflicts during the story. It also had an ending that wasn't what I predicted before. This book also continues in Encounter at Easton."
4,Study in Amorality,"If you read this series of novels by Patricia Highsmith with care you must come away from the experience disturbed to say the least. Under the guise of a murder mystery or suspense novel she ruthlessly spotlights middle-class morality and its' hypocrisy. Then again, maybe it's just a simple murder mystery after all. It's all up to you."
4,What imagaination!,"It's a very interesting novel about a picture forging company which is peppered with a murder case, a suicide and the living funeral of the main character. I'd never have thought that a story about forging paintings could be as interesting as that. It almost compels me to read another one of the Ripley books, like ""Ripley Under Water"" or ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"""
2,"Great idea, but...","For that price it should come with the hoses show in the picture and have a way to clamp them on at least, boy I would have been pissed if I had ordered this and didn't get the stuff shown in the photo!"
3,"works well, but...","I enjoy this separator. One complaint I have is that there are no instructions at all that come with this item. It needs improvement in the way that hoses are attached. It just has two 4 inch holes. Ideally it would have two attached male ends which rotate freely to which one could attach hoses. One has to jury rig the thing to get it to work. Additional improvements would include making it out of clear plastic so that one could easily see when the garbage can fills up and adding a means by which the separator could be attached to the garbage can. Other than these criticisms, the thing works as advertised. Happy woodworking!"
1,needs a gasket and male ports; too expensive,"I got this separator a couple of weeks ago and have been disappointed. First, it doesn't seal well to the top of the trash can, and second, the top only has two holes for the hoses to friction fit inside. There is no way to clamp the hoses to it or to make a tight seal. For this price, it should have male ports and some sort of a foam or rubber gasket to seal positively to the can.When I used it with my jointer, it only seems to collect about 10 percent of the chips, most continues on to the bag in my dust collector. I am going to save my money and get a good quality cylclone separator like the Onieda Air system."
3,I ALMOST DIED !,"This product works, it really gets rid of water, it recommends that you take up to 4 times daily. The first day I took 3 doses and it worked well, but on the second day, i took 4 doses (the max your supposed to take) and that night, I had cold sweat, nausea, constipation and dialed 911 and was rushed to the emergency room, i survived because I rehydrated myself when I woke up at 3 AM and found these symptoms. This product worked for me, dangerously well, but it almost killed me."
1,Not accurately sized,"This is supposed to fit shop vacuums with a 2-1/4"" opening. But the coupling on it is only 2-1/8"" OD and it slips through the 2-1/4"" opening on my Sears Craftsman shop vacuum. The other end has no coupling or taper--just the cut off end of the hose. The cut end could thread into the same coupling that is on its other end, but neither end will go on to any of the friction fit tools that come with my vacuum, or the vacuum itself. So before you buy this, make sure you can actually use it."
2,doesn't fit Rigid vac,Great quality but it doesn't fit my Rigid brand vac I rigged something up to work but it leaks. Should include an adapter for a very popular vacuum.
4,Best Guide for Man's Best Friend,"Although published in 1992 (which is why I only listed 4 stars), this reference book is up-to-date with information - (including information on microchip implants) on dog training, dog care, and first aid including information on breeds, veterinary care, and common ailments by breed as well as general ailments for all dogs- including diseases and parasites. Full color photos, illustrations, diagrams, and charts throughout the book offer helpful information for both the novice and experienced dog owner/lover. Chapters on training, birthing, new puppy care, and treating injured dogs are most helpful. Excellent index."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"This heater is worthless, when it ""heats up"" you can hold it in your hand. If you want to keep a cup of water in a metal cup from freezing, it might be good for that. It may be a defective unit, and I am sending it back."
4,Not what it seems,"The Movie Down to You,although the critics labeled it as a boy/girl movie,I thought it was a little more.It appeared to go in the way of a Guy dare issue,then it seemed like a sure relationship,Then it seemed like it all changed to an ending,well the ending didn't go the way I anticipated it would go.It touched all of the changes of a person, I think are like Seasons in a year.Deborah Elliott"
2,NOT GOOD,"Ok, I didn't like this movie at all. I watched it with high expectations, expecting a light, funny, happy romantic comedy. However, with all the narration I kind of lost interest. When it was over, quite honestly, I was like, ""Was there a point?"" Despite all the main characters' struggles, it seems like nothing dramatic or exciting happens. Its just kind of a story of the ups and downs of a troubled relationship, which is definately nothing worth making a movie about! There was simply nothing that made ""Down to You"" stand out from any other romantic comedy in my eyes."
1,Down to You,"This movie was very lame. I bought it because henry Winkler was in it. he is not in it very much, and the other Freddie Prince, Jr. and Julia Stiles ruined the movie with their bad acting, and nonattractiveness. Henry was good."
1,Rubbish,"The author thinks that people that suffer deppression can be cured through his methods. The author clearly has no medical training, however is an expert! Waste of money."
1,Kindergarten Reading,"Although the author's intentions are good, this book is obviously his first creation. It is written at such a basic level that it should be mandatory reading for kindergarten. He speaks in very broad and generic terms without much elaboration. Much of what he presents as breakthrough revelation is really just common sense."
4,Good mental gymnastics,This book has some good exercises to help get your focus and perceptions of events on track.
5,Contents,"Woodstock Craftsman's ManualProvoked by Jean Young1972First Edition HardcoverA Straight Ahead Guide to Weaving, Pottery, Macrame, Beads, Leather, Tie Dye & batik, Embroidery, Silkscreen, Home Recording, Candles, Crochet."
5,T42..,"Probably the most reliable of all the Thinkpads, well at least in recent memory. Avoid the thinkpads with the Radeon 7500 chip as it has a tendency to overheat and desolder itself from the motherboard, causing erronious errors such as color stripes, corruption and the like. Avoid the T43 as it has problems, T41 known to have some problems, T40 I believe is fairly solid as well. Had my T42 since '04, had no hardware failures of any sort."
1,Another bad purchase,"Another item I shouldn't have purchased. The attachments to the window sill are just plain silly. My cat sat on it once and there was a big crash as the whole thing fell down. Maybe if it had some huge screws to hold it on, it would work better. Does anyone want one of these things, cheap?"
1,Unstable Product,This product was a disappointment. It will not stay on the window with the stick-on Velcro provided and the metal brackets on the bottom move under my average sized cat's weight and make her uneasy about being on it.
4,Cat love's it but not stable,My cat love's it but it is not very stable so i had to use two screw's to the window sill. The Velcro is worthless. But after i attached it with the screw's my two cat's love it.
5,Cat Loves it!,"I received this product and it was very simple to install. As soon as I was done my cat jumped right on it and has been loving it every since. The padding on it is better that a previous one that I purchased that was a piece of junk. This one, however, is 100% better so I would definitely recommend it...I would also recommend this product because it's reasonably."
1,bad,It doesn't stay on the wall. It needs squews to work. Plus this thing is too small. Two cats and it is gone. Velco and glue doesn't keep it in place.
3,Velcro mounting - questionable quality,"The review states that no tools are necessary, but you need to put a very thick and tacky piece of velcro on your window sill to mount. You need to give the velcro 8 hours to 'cure' before you mount the perch. (Concerned about what my window sill will look like when I try to remove someday!) While the perch feels very secure once it is up, I have had it up for less than a week and it seems the foam underpad is already indented where the cat was laying, which makes me question the quality. Also note that while the image shows a light beige fabric, that may not be what you receive. My perch had dark brown fabric."
5,cats love it,"I bought 2. They are very easy to put on and the cats took to them immediately to watch their ""cat tv"" view of the outdoors. I have one cat that is about 17 lbs, and the tape part that adheres to the windowsill came off after a couple of days of him jumping on them. I bought the industrial strength velcro and replaced the tape portion,and have had no more issues. I would definitely buy them again."
1,Big Thumbs Down,"Spectacularly unimpressed with this product and with the whole transaction. I ordered this cat perch but the item I received looked nothing like the photo posted at Amazon. The product description says there are assorted colors, but there is no way to select a color when placing the order. Based on the photo posted with the product description, I expected to get a white cat perch with simple ""L""-shaped arms that would hold it to the wall. Instead I got a brown cover and the arms had curly cues on the ends; these did not hold the perch securely to the wall at all and the Velcro did not adhere to the window sill for more than a couple of weeks. (I've had other cat perches at the same location in my home, and the Velcro lasted for years.) If it was possible to give this item 0 stars then I would do so."
3,"Good looking, doesn't stand up well over time","My husband really loved this ring. It's very simple but not your typical shiny, plain band. The problem is that the finish gets scratched really easily - it already had scratches by the end of our wedding weekend! You have to look closely to see them so only we know about them but it is disappointing. But we decided for what we spent it was worth it. Eventually we'll be able to spend more on something of higher quality. For now it looks good from the distance from which most people see it."
4,Great so far,"This is a fun book. So far, I've made and loved the Goat Cheese Quesadillas with homemade pico di gallo and guacamole. It was fantastic! The Southwest cheese pie is incredible as well. The cilanto potato salad was so-so. The recipe's are definitely impressive. The main caveat is that you need to plan to spend a lot of time prepping! The recipes are not difficult, but it seems that Emeril never buys anything pre-made. Make your own tortillas...your own pie crust...your own seasonings! I definitely take short cuts (i.e. pie crust, tortillas). But I did make the seasoning.I recommend this book for anyone who really likes to spend time in the kitchen and do a lot of work. For people who don't really care to cook, skip it."
4,"book is worth buying just for one recipie, the NNO pasta",Readers who have a urge for a great dish need only to make the New New Orleans Pasta. This dish alone is worth the purchase of the book. Most cook books are bought looked at maybe one or two recipies attempted and never looked at again. Emeril Lagasse's book is not like that.. even so just to learn the secrets of NNO Pasta is a purchase well made. Tom Fleming /Chicago
1,Poorly done,"I was seriously disappointed with this book. It was poorly written. A lot of the recipes were incomplete, others had glaring mistakes in the quantities. I have managed to figure some of them out on my own by playing with measurements or figuring out when to mix in an ingredient. The end results have been okay, but not worth all of this trouble. Emeril can be fun to watch, but his food seems to be suspect."
3,"Love the System, Don't love this addition.","While the white wolf system is usually thoroughly enjoyable, I have found that the Mage characters start off fairly weak, easy pray for any others. The book itself was fairly easy to follow, but a little too much game specific information that newbies would not understand. I have also found the combat system to be a bit clunky at best.The play section was misorganized (Character creation should come before playing rules) and the whole 5 pages that explain the rules do a poor job."
5,"An Excellent ""Handbook"" for Consultants/Professionals","As a manager at a leading accounting and consulting firm, I found the book extremely relevant for anyone who is in the ""professional services"" business, or would like to be. This book should be considered the ""best practices"" of providing professional services. From my experience with other professionals, many of us think we are a doing a better job of provding top-notch client service than we actually are. Mr. Maister does an excellent job of providing ideas and insights as to how to increase the quality of service you provide to your clients, and perhaps most importantly, how to increase your own job satisfaction."
5,Women like so much,I saw this product in Panama but I finally bought it in USA. The product is comfortable and very light. I recommend it.
3,interesting,"Offers tips on everything from parallel parking to preparing a quick hot meal. However, the author's know-it-all tone was a little grating. I also wanted to know WHY these techniques were preferable as opposed to others. Finally, I wished that the author had divulged the sources of her knowledge. That would have added to the book, I think, rather than subtracted. None of us are born knowing how to do everything."
2,Not good,I thought it was crap and tedious. Completely unbelievable situation and story and just got worse. Very American and seemed to dwell in stereotypes of middle America to the point it drowned.
2,Much too shallow an attempt,"Really, this is barely a service to African American women who fell through the cracks. Please!"
5,I love this show!,"This is one of the best seasons for the Ice Road Truckers, who doesn't like seeing Lisa Kelly showing the guys up lol. Plus she is a cute little woman and loves dirt bikes."
5,Amazing,"I'm usually not interested in watching something like this show, but I am amazed with it. It is very interesting to watch. I could even sit down and watch it by myself (without the spouse). They have alot of nerve to do what they do. I give them thumbs up. Sure enjoy Alex's little sayings. Good job."
5,Excellent book with great instructions and good graphics.,"I have found this as well as other books by Deanna Hall West to be very well written, very well graphed out with a lot of ideas for how one would use the design. I would not hesitate to recommend this book as I feel I am a professional designer with silk ribbon and love it."
4,Emotional Roller Coaster,"I had seen the movie based on this novel on television several years ago. The main characters, Dane and Helen, were played by Richard Chamberlain and Karen Allen. I had forgotten most of the story so I wanted to read the book. It is short and an easy, quick read. The characters were up and down with their feelings for each other and their denial of their feelings. I wasn't sure if I wanted them to get together or for Dane to take off, never to return to Raven Island. Not wanting to give away the ending, I must say that I had to keep reading to find out the ending that kept me wondering up to the very end. I enjoyed the book and made me want to read more by Evan Maxwell."
5,DRS'S Gangsta Lean,"If you like the old school music, then definitely check this album out! I am happy to own this album again, it has some great songs that I guarantee you will never hear anywhere else! Its absolutely not like anything else I have ever heard!"
4,A Two Two Adventure,Jacob Two-Two is 2+2+2 years old but very clever when he goes on a adventure into the childrens prison. He has to call on the help of the Fearless O'Toole & the Intrepid Shapiro. When Jacob Two-Two meets the Hooded Fang he learns that he is not a cruel man but a warm hearted man.
4,Jacob two-two Jacob two-two,"When Jacob Two-two is thrown in the childrens prison on Slimers Isle for mocking a big person it's up to him with a little help from Fearless O'Toole and the Intrepid Shapiro (child power) to save the kids of Slimers Isle from the mean, excrutiating,vile Hooded Fang.Read this book to find out if Jacob Two-Two, even as small as he is can save the children of Slimers Isle."
4,Great music for Diego Fans,This cd didn't disappoint. My daughter loves it to bits while my husband and i enjoy the good mix of music. It's a cd full of music which caters to the whole family.
3,Not as good as her previous novels,"I bought this book because I greatly enjoyed the author's two previous novels, ""The Deep End of the Ocean"" and ""The Most Wanted"". Her latest book was a little disappointing, mainly because the characters seemed much less ""real"" than in the other two books. This may have been because this book has so many characters you can hardly keep them straight (and it doesn't help that they are so poorly rendered). The basic story was intriguing (a couple dies in car crash, both families want custody of the toddler they left behind), but it didn't ""grab"" me and make me race through the book to find out what happened the way ""Deep End"" and ""Most Wanted"" did."
3,"Great premise, poor execution","The premise of the books is a good one - a young child is orphaned when her parents are killed in an automobile crash and both sides of her family (granparents and aunts/uncles) want to raise her. What could have been a wonderfully tense and moving story was in fact, so muddled that I forced myself to keep reading. It was hard to get a sense of any of the characters (they all blurred so badly I stopped trying to keep them straight) or a feel for the emotional upheaval they were going through. Two-thirds of the book was consumed with wallowing and floundering (and a few overly dull courtroom scenes), and the last third hinged on major coincidence and manipulation. There were many thought-provoking issues the book could have addressed, but to the extent it covered them at all, it brushed past. Sadly."
3,good potential,"This was a book with so much potential, it's too bad it didn't get some editorial help to make it a great book. The strong points were that the characters felt so real to me, and I really felt attached to them. But other than that, reading it was painful. First, the author unfortunately tries to give us points of view of too many characters, making the reader not know any one character in depth, and reading too many details. Also, I didn't like the way the reader was kept in torturing suspense as to the fate of Keefer's custody. I finally figured it out within a completely new context at the very end - the author knew we would all want to know, so why write about it 'by the way'? The book just took too many different directions, taking me off the original path of caring and feeling for the characters."
1,confusing,I couldn't get past the first 70 pages. I found her writing style to be very confusing. I was having to re-read so many paragraphs that it was just not enjoyable.
3,Audio Book Listener,"The characters in this book were well developed- but there were so MANY of them!I wanted to make a Family Tree just to keep them all straight!If you've never tried listening to Aduio Books, you should give them a try- they're WONDERFUL entertainment while doing housework, traveling, gardening, and you don't have to turn on the light when you want to ""read"" at night!"
3,More delicate than expected,Watch out for the seal between the plastic attachment ring and the bag itself as it gets strained under the weight of even a one-half full bag and can tear out. For the record i have not been able to get these bags more than 40% full of dry wall dust before they start to spring a leak. Maybe this is the best compromise that can be acheived between loss of air flow and loss of dust.???
5,Great but Sad ending to an wonderful Band.,"The End of Gloomy Grim's Career. I talked to Agathon (Vocals) for Gloomy Grim, And this was the Last of their music!! How Sad it is.....But I am glad I have all of their music, Every Track, I listen to them almost every Day. Highly Recommended!!!! For Fans of, Gehenna, Ninnghizzhida, Septic Flesh, Rites of Thy Degrinolade, Black Mass, And Obituary."
1,Boring,"I found this to be a tale of how great/interesting/novel this woman's life has been. Earning money by playing the piano on the east coast? I wish I'd been able to do that as a teenager! Instead, I was working at the local McDonald's. So rather than funny, I found the book to be a bit pretentious. I prefer memoirs that show some human weakness!"
2,Its ok,as far as pop-up books go this one is not at the top of the list but it is not hard on the wallet
3,very ordinary art,"This would be fine for little kids, but for pop-up book fans it is disappointing. The art is very ordinary."
4,Ironclad Promise,"Bob Wall brings the civil war to life in the captivating story of Henry Lowry, a young man who defies his widowed mother's wishes and sails aboard the ironclad during the Civil War. The action is exciting, the period is deftly brought to life but the author's great strength lies in his expert characterizations. I felt I knew Henry, his mother, his grandfather and all the others who people this marvelous story of caring, choices and courage. Kudos to Wall for a job well done."
2,Unsufferable De Johnette,"Of course this record contains one of the best intro to All The Things You Are ever..But you also have to undergo one of the most unsufferable drummer ever, especially on the ballads..I was listening to this CD while driving, and De Johnette was such a P.I.T.A during Ballad Of The Sad Young Men that I took the CD from the player, open the window, and threw it on the highway.."
4,The movie...,"I read this book back in 1991, and though a little clunky in some places at 900+ pages long, it was a great book, and - as with so many Tom Clancy books - an all too possible scenario. Also, as with so many Clancy books, I thought it would make a good movie in the right hands. 10 years later, it seems filming has been completed in June of 2001, and we MAY see the movie in theaters by summer of 2002. I say ""may"" because it occurs to me that since the story depicts a nuclear attack on a U.S. city with a weapon brought in by boat and truck - a scenario which would very visibly raise questions & increase debate about the real value of the Bush Administration's much-vaunted missile-shield defense plan - there are parties who would probably like to see this film go away or at least have it's release delayed."
3,Disappointments from Tom Clancy,"I wish I didn't have to rate this so low, but the truth is the majority of the book was boring. The last four books I've read have been Tom Clancy's, and I must say ""EXECUTIVE OREDERS"" is a much better book."
2,Takes Too Long,Really exciting ending. But getting there is a real chore. Mind numbing detail about uninteresting plot twists. The book should have been about half the length.
4,We Still Need Jack Ryan!,"Before I read this novel my impression of Tom Clancy had been that he writes Russian related political suspence represented byThe Hunt For Red October and Red Storm Rising. But this novel shows that the world still need a Jack Ryan. Actually I would like to hear him say ""Mr. President, you are acting irrational"".Terrosists who steal nuke from Isreal and detonate at Super Bowl series sounds so real now that bandits that might do the same abound. Situation is close as well. Russians are now allies not enemies. And rising tension in Mid East. It's a bit long and tedious for non-native speakers of English. And as a Japanese who heard about Hiroshima and Nagasaki about 60 years ago, lack of radiation description is a big disappointment. Despite that, the last 200 pages compensate all the frustration. I would like to see again how Jack would deal with another incident of global terrosism."
2,Loooonng Wiiiiinded - Long Winded - please edit!!!,"Good plot, good characters, but too long, waaayyy toooo long!!!Too many side stories, with some characters who don't play an important part at all; so it can get confusing and frustrating. This reader (a patient one) wanted to keep to the main part of the storyline, and the action, but Clancy takes forever to get to it. By the time I reached the action towards the end, I had labored through 700 odd pages and it seemed as if the climax was just not worth it. As a result, it felt like a book you had to read for school or college, not just for fun.Not one of my favorite Clancy books."
2,Someone get this guy an editor.,Let me start out as saying that I am a fan of Tom Clancy. I loved almost every book that came before this. Sum of all Fears is a very compelling story but this book could afford to lose about 300 pages. Does the reader really need to follow the path of a tree being shipped to Japan? Yes it does play a significant role later in the story but do I need to know the name of the guy who cut it down and how he came to be a lumberjack? We're given 3 pages of background on a cop who is murdered and never mentioned again. And the building of the bomb! I skipped many pages when it came to this. It's by sheer luck that I happened to stumble on the only significant part of the bomb's making.This book almost put me off Clancy for good. I haven't and probably won't read DEBT OF HONOR or EXECUTIVE ORDER. I did read and enjoy the John Clark stories WITHOUT REMORSE and RAINBOW SIX. Retire Jack Ryan and stick with Clark and Ding Chavez.
3,Not His Best,"There are several things that Tom Clancy does well, and several that he does rather badly. All of them come together in this book. The plot is a believable account of nuclear terrorism in the US, which, put together with the larger story of Mideast tensions, is an engaging read.However, Tom Clancy had better steer away from his attempts to do love scenes. They are stomach-churningly rendered, and they do nothing to advance the plot.Number two, and just as disturbing, is the attempt to re-make the character of John Clark. He attempts to give Clark a human face, but I feel he goes overboard in re-making him to be - in his own words - a teddybear. That is not Clark's role in these novels, and comes out badly.All in all, have a little patience for the slower parts in the middle of this book. Patience for the irrelevant segments - all the submarine sequences and an inexplicable sub-plot involving a felled redwood and a Japanese temple. Pretty decent fun."
4,"Got Superbowl tickets? Sell them, quickly!","When an Isreali plane carrying a nuclear bomb is downed in Syria, the bomb survives the crash. When the US and NATO plan a religious treaty to end all the fighting in the Middle East, and a group of Muslim terorists find that nuclear bomb, the stage is set for disaster. The terrorists target, the Superbowl, with the Presdent in attendance. Good reading and pace. Nice book."
1,Disappointing,I have read a lot of Tom Clancy and this I couldn't even finish. He jumped around so much and a lot of information during one of his jumps didn't even seem to relate to what might turn out to be the story. Very disappointing. Don't waste your time.
2,Movie not so hot!,I could not get into Ben Affleck playing the role of Jack Ryan. I thought the movie was mediocre and just didn't do it for me. In my mind stick with the novel and pass up the movie.If you like Harrisson Ford as Jack Ryan then Ben Affleck is surely going to disappoint in my mind. Doesn't live up to Ford's persona on the big screen.
3,Very timely (2001),"Given the current world situation (2001), I found the bombmaking stuff to be the most interesting.In an afterword, Clancy declares nuclear energy to be both safe and environmentally benign. Nuclear waste, however, is neither.We need to seek out clean alternative energy sources and peaceful means of ending conflict."
4,THE DAY AFTER,VERY REALISTIC DEPICTION OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN DURING A NUCLEAR ATTACT. SHOWS CHAOTIC PARANOIA BEFORE DURING AND AFTER A NUCLEAR ATTACT.
3,"Powerful Then, Powerful Now","I remember watching this on TV in 1983 & the 1-800 number 2 call 4 those who got paranoid! The movie didn't really bother my family back then, but it had us thinking. Now present day, my kids saw this movie on TV & they're asking me questions! Wow! Considering what's goin on in the world 2day, this movie still asks the question...What If?"
5,Fantastic All-Purpose Vacuum,"I have utilized many shop vacs and home vacs over the years, just like most people, I'm sure. And I have come to the conclusion that buying a home vacuum is foolish when a shop vac will work much better and is more versatile. I bought this vacuum in conjunction with a Fein Multimaster but I also use it to vacuum my home. It is very quite with none of the typical high-pitched whining we've all come to love about shop vacs. This vac has very strong suction and, for home use, works better than a dedicated $600 vacuum I once owned. For the shop, in dry work I use the HEPA filter with great results. Yes, the attachments cost extra but they work well. If I had a complaint it would be that the european version can be registered for the 3 year warranty but not the U.S. version."
4,Paper vacuum bags at almost the price of gold!,I don't recall prior reviews addressing the obscene cost of the paper vacuum bags. They cost nearly $7 each! My plan is to forget the bags so I'm not taxed seven bucks each time I clean out the vacuum!
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"As an avid Oz collector, I buy almost anything out there related to Oz. I thought this might be an interesting commentary on the book. IT IS A DULL PILE OF DRIVEL!... The entire thing consists of one typo-fillled run-on sentence that makes no sense! Absolutely none! And it is very small and short. I just bought a 572 page novel that cost less!... BEWARE!..."
1,In the Penalty Box!,"Ugh! That's all you need to know. Go buy something else. Okay, if you must know.... It's mainly minor league hockey. And yes it is mainly brawls. You see the same clips MULTIPLE times. It is clear that the creator of the DVD just got a new video editting tool and therefore goes NUTS with clip transitions - really distracting. And the coverage is just not that good. The humorous clips has clips from MITES!!!! games."
2,Bloopers? Not exactly.,"Well, it was okay to watch one time, but this is not a great DVD. It's mostly fights, not bloopers, and the recording quality is horrific: bad visuals, intermittent audio, etc. It was entertaining for the price, but the other DVDs are far superior: NHL Full Access, Tough Guys, etc. Of course they are NHL endorsed."
1,Returned item,This item arrived in nonworking order and we had to return it. It was also much bigger then expected. Better measurements would have been a help.
2,Adobe FramaMaker 7.0 Classroom in a book,"The disk that accompanies the book is inaccurate. It made doing the lessons very confusing. I finally had to contact Adobe Press to find out why the lessons and the sample files didn't work as mentioned in the book. They said the disk had errors, they would send me a replacement. But I'm still waiting... it has been over two week since they said they would send a replacement.And of course like the series of books of the Classroom in a book... it isn't very detailed especially on authoring structured FrameMaker."
2,Disappointed... mix is more wheat and barley than rye,"I purchased a six pack of this bread mix and was disappointed.This bread mix contains rye, but based upon the ingredients list it contains more more wheat flour, and malted barley flour than whole grain rye flour. If you are purchasing this product hoping that it is predominantly whole grain rye flour you will be disappointed. If you are trying to avoid wheat due for health or allergy reasons please look elsewhere."
2,Not so good,"I had high hopes for this, and other variations from Hodgson Mill, so I bought 18 boxes at the same time I purchased our breadmaker! First I realized that I had to set the crust setting on ""light"" to not get a nearly burned loaf (maybe a breadmaker issue?), but even then the missus and I agreed that each of the three varieties we bought were rather tasteless."
2,Non-caraway bread,"If you like rye bread, you can forget it with this bread mix.I did not like it, the basic flour used was probably the cheapestflour on the market?????????????"
2,"Heavy weight, Super sucking machine.","It sure sucks everything up including carpet itself. I'm concerned that my carpet will be paper thin in few years. Long cord is good, but both body and wind tunnel part are so heavy to carry around the house and it is not made for wood floor at all. I don't think it's worth the money and I don't recommend anyone to buy it."
1,Never again will we buy Hoover,We purchased a Hoover bagless canister last year. The electrical connection between the hose and wand broke due to a very poor design. Never again will we buy Hoover.
2,"Strong suction, but hard to move around","Ive had this vacumn for about 2 years. After about a year the spinning brush only goes on when the handle is tilted a certain way. Still has very good power. Bad news, it doesnt move around easy. It is like dragging an old tire around, hard to turn and direct, canister always rolls over. The only reason i am still using it is because i only have area rugs in a large apt, and dont vacumn that often, i guess because i dread using it. I am looking for a simipler unit with a bag because the hepa filter starts to smell after a while. But still like i said, lots of power if you keep the filter clean."
1,stopped working,"I purchased this vacuum to replace another Hoover canister vacuum that started smoking. I had fun with this vacuum for about two years, but for no reason it just stopped working. No power, nothing. I do hope that others have better luck with it."
1,never arrived,"This book was ordered before Thanksgiving Day. After waiting for 6 weeks, I canceled the order. It might be a great book, prefect for my needs, but does me little good if I can't get a copy."
1,Where's the Mythos?,"For fans of Lovecraft? From what I've seen this has nothing to do with the Cthulhu Mythos. No Cthulhu, R'Lyeh, Nyarlathotep. I don't think you should have ""psychic gumshoe"" in horror stories. It sounds like something from the kid's section. If you want Mythos buy Lovecraft."
3,Own for nostalgia,"Having the VHS release of several episodes, I was suprised at the poor quality of this product. My DVD back-up of my VHS tape looks better than most of these. But I understand these are not guaranteed sellers (will they EVER release the rest of the Superboy live-action series?) so it's best not to put a lot of money into the production, even up to the case art and DVD menus looking NOTHING like the cartoon. But if having a bad copy is better than none, I appreciate this being released, and through Amazon relatively cheaply. The retrospective featurette was great, a funny tale of how Filmation bluffed their way through getting DC to sign on with them for the series. So low marks for the technical quality, but good marks for getting it out on DVD."
5,Fantasia 2000 - A Masterpiece,"I was fortunate enough to see the IMAX version of this film. The original Fantasia has always been one of my favorites, but Fantasia 2000 surpasses even that. For me, the combination of the wonderful animation, the stories, and the great music made for an intense emotional experience. I experienced a sense of awe at the beauty and creativity of the animation and a number of times I discovered tears rolling down my face. This film is truly a masterpiece!"
1,Horrible.,"I knew what I was getting as far as the movie with this purchase, however what the seller failed to mention was that the DVD was actually a bootleg. Not in new shrink wrap, it was in a cheap plastic slip with a printed cover. Worst of all, upon popping the DVD in the player to make sure it at least worked it is dubbed in JAPANESE!! This seller was by far the worst experience I have ever had on Amazon. No reply, no refund, nothing. I urge anyone who comes across this seller not to buy these cheap bootlegs from them."
2,"Fantasia 2000, a cut below the rest.","I was a big fan of fantasia, and was expecting something from fantasia 2000. It didn't happen. Fantasia was a beautiful movie with good music. Fantasia 2000 made a mockery of the artistry that went into the original. It was like taking ""Star Wars"" (circa 1977), and since it was old, replacing it with (you name any bad flick). Yes, the graphics were a little better, but the movie, and the whole feel of a once masterpiece, was disheartening. Only the people that had seen Fantasia in the original will understand; I would pay to see the original Fantasia on the screen, although the newer fantasia disgusted me. If you change the name, it would be OK, but don't defame fantasia. (If you've seen the original first, don't see it. )"
4,A great followup to a Disney classic.,"Alive with music and brilliant animation the new Fantasia2000 film is not an instant Disney classic but it is a definate must see. It is not as good as the original but it is just as vibrant and colorful. This film has something that the original did not have, celebrities. Steve Martin, Better Midler, and Angela Lansbury introduce some of the musical pieces. The animation is really beautiful to watch. I highly reccomend this film."
5,A great walt disney movie.,This is a great walt disney movie.From steamboat willie to now.I wish walt was here to see what his creations are now.
5,Family Systems applied to the culture,"Friedman is not rehashing old work here. This is a new application of the Bowen Family Systems work as applied to leadership within the culture. I think his insights on anxiety in the culture are right on, and as always there is more hope where there is more understanding.I recommend this to book to preachers, teachers, writers and analysts because these insights are distinctive and helpful."
4,Insightful,"This is a profound book that every leader should read. The author has deep insight into the human heart, relational health, and social trends. I enjoyed how he supported his insights from the world of science, and how he provided valid critiques to pop psychology. The call to take personal responsibility for our choices is welcomed, but as profound as his argument is, we are not given much help to do so. In the end, I am enlightened and impressed, but I would appreciate a more empowering conclusion."
1,The Hollies were never on The Ed Sullivan Show,"Partial clips in stunning quality are very frustrating to watch. The Hollies clip is from The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. All songs are edited and incomplete. Graham Nash and Michelle Phillips are decent as hosts, but this is one DVD you will not want to watch more than once. Too bad."
1,Over valued for its actual worth,"It is all I could find in preparation to see the opera in 2002, so in that respect I guess it is alright in the function of informing me about the story. However, other lines of liberettos and study guides are superior. Will not buy Opera Journey Guides again if I can help it."
2,"Another way of saying,""Coming out of the Closet.""","On the Down Low : A Journey Into the Lives of ""Straight"" Black Men Who Sleep With Men. This title is just a dress up way for the ""straignt"" black man to say, ""He is coming out of the closet."" No difference."
4,I can appreciate..,"I can appreciate the way J.L King does not hold back his views and experiences. This book has made me look at men in a different light. If you have any thoughts your man could be ""on the low"" this book is a must have. There is a GREAT chance you will learn things that you have already seen your man do, or thought he could be doing. The break down of the different types of DL men, makes almost to much sense. Every female needs to read this book even to just have a know how on how to read certain men. Good job J.L. King. A great read!"
3,Down Low Was JUST Okay,I did like this book but it seemed to me that we needed more information as to why straight black men mess around with gay guys.
1,Let the Witch Hunt begin,"I am so sorry that this book has gained the fame that it has. It is true that is has brought to the light a very serious matter, but it also helped to cement some of your ignorances. The instant someone says that are gay, especially is its a black male, society says AIDS. Well guess what, AIDS is not a punishment from God. God isn't man and doesn't work like you all work, thank goodness for that. Not all gay men hav AIDS.....and think........your negative attitudes are what make it so hard for men to come out and be themselves. Its such a catch 22. Society says ""If you're gay, then be gay"" but then you turn around and attack those who are gay."
2,Nice try but....,"This book seemed like Gay 101. Any gay or bi person who reads this will be bored out of their minds and any straight person with a clue would have already figured this stuff out ages ago.Just like every other dreadful thing in the States, they've got to now give closeted married men who cheat on their wives and destroy their lives a cute name, in this instance, on the down low.Sorry, but closeted men in absolute bonkers denial are found in every race and country. King might be a good speaker and especially good at separating people from their money, but this stunning revelation that married men might cheat on their wives and ruin their lives was covered decades ago in Kate Jackson's Making Love."
4,Great coming of age novel,"This is the 2nd book I read by Nicholls - first was One Day which I also highly recommend.While I think I liked One Day more than Starter for Ten - I definitely liked Starter For Ten as well.Easy read, very funny - and just all around a great weekend book!"
5,Fabulous Book,"This book was great. I can't remember who recommended it to me, but I wish I did so I could thank them. David Nicholls is a great author, love the dry, self-deprecating British humor. I found myself laughing out loud during several parts of the book. He is a great story teller and the book has a very satisfying ending. (This book is better than The Understudy, but that is worth a read also)."
5,A heartbreaking work of staggering genius,"What a refreshing surprise it was to accidentally come across this wonderful book. It's laugh-out-loud funny in places, but also has a wonderful undercurrent tinged with sadness. Truly a deep and moving book with some of the most insightful observations this side of the ""big pond."" Nicholls is bound to become a hot topic in this country as this book makes its way into more and more reader's hands.Also recommended: McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD"
2,Shallow,"As a new father of a beautiful baby girl, I awaited delivery of this book with a great deal of anticipation. As soon as it arrived, I put aside the paperback I had been working on. Too bad for me. This book starts out promisingly enough. The first section (dealing with birth and early childhood) is kind of neat. But, as the book progresses (through the school years and adulthood), I found myself becoming more and more discouraged. The mostly dysfunctional father/daughter relationships did nothing for me. In fact, several of the anecdotes really disturbed me. The book becomes more of a downer with each page. I ultimately set it aside and did not finish it. To the authors - nice try, but, in my opinion, you did not do what you set out to do. Instead of touching stories of the unique bond between fathers and daughters, you presented a series of Inside Edition-like stories. I don't see the point."
2,Didn't come how I expected,"I've ordered this product for years for my dog and I always get the 4lb version because it lasts the longest and is the best value for the money. The product itself is great, however, it's the container itself that I have a problem with. ...this time for some reason I was sent 4 separate 1 pound bottles. That's kind of impractical. It takes up more space in my cabinet and it wasn't the 4 lb. bottle that was pictured when I placed the order. Just be aware and make extra sure that you are getting ONE 4lb bottle when ordering. This has never happened in all of the years I have purchased this product, but now I am aware to ask!"
3,I'm too stupid to learn to sign,The book was clear I don't think my brain was. Nobody to sign with so what direction that send me? When is Christmas anyway maybe I can give this to someone.
3,"Good cordless phone, but . . .","I selected this model as a high quality cordless phone that doesn't have a built in message recorder (I already have a stand-alone recorder that works great!)The new phone works great, although setting it up with a second auxiliary phone takes very careful following of the directions -- I almost accidentaly reset the base phone ID number, which is ok, except I didn't realize what I'd done and I couldn't recall the new number after I reset it, which would have required a call to the manufacture, if I hadn't remembered the new code number! So, read the manual.For audio quality and look and feel, this phone is great!My only complaint is that the built in clock is very inaccurate -- it actually looses about 4 minutes a week! In this day and age of electronic quartz controlled clocks, an loss like that is pretty amazing! It means I have to reset it once a week or so, which is worse than my 100 year old grandfather clock! All in all, a minor inconvenience, but odd."
1,Don't buy this phone!,"This phone is ridiculously expensive and it's been nothing but problematic since we bought it last December. Siemens has replaced our phones (we're still waiting for the last one), but now it's a new set of problems. At first it was an issue of the thing keeping time (you have to set the time, unlike many other phones that get it ""magically""). Now the phone is beeping at random times, the message light doesn't flash anymore, and the company is slower than molasses to resolve the issues. Defintely save your money and buy a cheaper phone!"
3,"Lacked other ""wind"" instruments","Copeland's band brings the brass, but lacks sounds from the a$$. Who told them to play the trumpets with their mouths? This album lacks the distinctive sounds that Brother Copeland is known for. I was expecting his blessed wind to blast right through my speakers and stir up the Holy Ghost. This recording was an evening of wasted air."
1,Check the Shipping Price Before Ordering,"I was happy to find this product on Amazon, except for the rather high per unit price. Until I saw the eight dollar shipping price for just one screw!!!!! Good thing I didn't click the buy button without checking."
5,"Very, very moving","This book had me in tears. I think I drove all my friends insane- i picked up this book and read it through lunch, recess, bus rides, everything for 2 days straght 'till I finished it. Veronica made you one of her close, personal, friends- she spilled her guts. It's totally AWESOME!!"
2,Dust hood would be better without a tapered connection,Dust hoods and tapered connections don't go well together - I'd rather [have] a non-tapered fitting so I can get a hose clamp on it without it coming off
4,Adaptability,Allowed me to st up my shop vacuum system the way that I needed to do so! I was abel to branch off and add more peices onto the system!
1,Dead on arrival.,"I received two of these drives, the first was DOA, and so was the replacement. Amazon customer service is, as always, great! They replaced it faster than expected, but this particular product seems to be susceptible to failure. I am just not willing to deal with a third dead drive. I am getting something else.It is a great price, but not if your time is more valuable than dealing with returns for defective equipment."
3,Drives Great - Needs Power,"I found this beautifully designed drive at an amazing discount. ~50% less than equivalent-sized competitor products. It is small, fast, sleek ... and apparently needs an accessory AC adapter brick in order to draw enough power to spin up the drive consistently. I have tried connecting the drive to 6 very different systems I have here (a couple laptops, a compact desktop, a couple high-end workstations, and a server - all systems within 3 years of age, and one a brand new Dell model) and none of the systems was able to offer enough power through the USB ports to spin up the drive (whether one or both plug ends of the supplied USB Y-cable were used). One trip to Radio Shack and $30 later, it spins up like a champ. Does what it needs to do (except for the reduced portability). Until flash memory comes in 160GB units, I am satisfied with this."
3,Runaway Bunny,"The book is nicely illustrated; however, it is not yet suitable for my 12 month old. It doesn't hold her attention at all, hopefully this will change as she ages. A nice book for her bookshelves in the meantime."
4,Good toy-book combo,"This set made a nice shower gift, just be forewarned that the bunny is on the small side. If you prefer more ""huggable"" stuffed toys I'd buy the book separately and then go shopping for a suitable bunny companion."
1,"If He Wants To Go So Badly, Let Him Go","I am going to be a father in a few days and I picked up this ""charming"" little book. I could not believe how uppity this bunny was. To be honest with you, this insolent little lagomorph shows no remorse whatsoever for the trials and tribulations he is obviously eager to put his (possibly unhealthily) devoted mother through. He ends up staying only because he realizes he just can't get away from his mom.I can't imagine letting my impressionable young daughter get away with this attitude!"
4,sweet memories,"I have lots of memories of my Mom reading me this as a little one, and now I get to read it to my darlin' daughter :) Great little story!"
1,General Dislike for such a Classic,"Wanting my child's library to include all of the classics, The Runaway Bunny seems like a perfect fit. Unfortunately, it is one of my least favorite book purchases. The reviewers that state it has a creepiness to it are spot on. The story is neither comforting or enjoyable. The colors used, on the few pages that are in full color, are very brash. They remind me of the colors you see in a 70s style kitchen. I regret the addition of this book to my child's library due to not liking the story, its illustrations, and color palette."
1,Terrible,"The book and pictures are fine, but the story is awful. The mother bunny is totally smothering - give the kid some space! Just because the little rabbit needs some space doesn't mean the love is not there. The only part I like is when the mother turns into a tree. At least the little rabbit can choose to fly back instead of being constantly hounded! I have to explain to my kids (2 and 3 years old) that it is okay for them to want to be alone sometimes whenever I read this book to them (which is not often)."
3,MMMMM..........,"Well - at first I didn't like the book - the format is different, but my son seemed to like it. This is not one of his favoriates, but he does enjoy the book."
2,I Was Disappointed,"Gary's new book starts promisingly enough, sketching out how a vast left-wing conspiracy has inched its tentatcles throughout the chambers of the Democrat Party's heart. Gary skillfully reveals the hidden connections between such well known figures of the left as Ralph Nader and Al Gore. But then, with his discussion of the ""UFO crash"" in Roswell, New Mexico, Gary makes an astonishing leap: We are to believe a Democratic cover-up has, for decades, concealed the introduction of Martian genetic material into human DNA? This might an interesting premise for a science fiction novel, but I expected more from a serious work of political theory. Sorry, Gary. You let me down."
1,hmmm,"This looks a lot like the one I bought at home depot. As a bottle opener, it doesn't work very well, and that was why I bought it."
5,Good Exegesis if subject,"This is only a 100 page book but is very solid from it's scholarly treatment of the subject. For most persons the subject of Principalities and Powers is something from a by gone era. But it is as true today as it was in the period in which the New Testament was written. Schlier's approach is that of a scholar and he does not extrapolate beyond what is presented in Scripture. A short book well worth reading. Too bad it is out of print, I would add it to my library."
2,Nothing sharp here,"Recalling how fast Amazon ships on book orders I naively believed the same would apply to a microwave oven. Forget it. And not only was delivery slow it was late. A product made in Japan was shipped to Los Angeles from New York state. Go figure. Does Amazon provide this kind of shipping info before you order? No. Now to top it all off the product is flawed: the exterior of the control keypad is apparently a piece of plastic stuck onto the underlying surface, which has since developed air bubbles that will not go away. It looks shoddy; it feels shoddy. Recommendations: 1) Don't buy small appliances through Amazon; 2) Don't buy this microwave oven."
1,Microwave for RV,Our microwave went out and this was the replacement. It is just what we wanted and needed. The company was excellent to deal with.
4,Excellent microwave,I'm used to industrial microwaves(the ones used in resturants)& this one out performs those at allmost all tasks. The only place where it only matches their performance is with large frozen meals. I will definitly recomend this microwave
4,Useful,"To any who are already practicing The Craft, Wicca, or Magic - this book isn't for you.This book is a good starting point. It's a way to bridge the difference between Freud mentality and The Craft's psyche. Also it provides powerful insight about the power of the sub-conscious and meditation.After reading this, I read many books on the Craft and private forms of spirituality. I've come to believe that magic is far more than Phillip Cooper does. Phillip clearly believes that magic is only the power of the sub-conscious mind, I disagree.This book will help beginners along, and hopefully they'll surpass it."
3,This Leonard offering left me Blue.,"Maybe I've lost my love of everything Elmore, but ""Tishomingo Blues"" was a bit of a disappointment.There is no doubt - this book is stamped from cover to cover with Mr. Leonard's touch. The story is well researched, the characters are intriguing, and the wit is ever sharp. Unfortunately, these elements didn't make up for an average plot. Sure, the civil war reenactment is a great setting, and Mr. Leonard nails the Deep South atmosphere like a pro. But the story just doesn't pull the reader from page to page like some of his other works. There was simply nothing here that had me wondering what was going to happen next.My lack of enthusiasm for this book may just be a case of burnout. I've come to expect a lot from Mr. Leonard, and this one didn't deliver for me. However, this is a well-written book, with lots of great elements. If you're looking for a quick read of typical Elmore, this will do. If you're looking for Mr. Leonard's best work, dive into ""Get Shorty."""
4,Not so hard,"Very catchy. Starts out quite slow but ends with meaning and leaves a smile on the readers face. 'Easy' Emma's first book is still #1 in my opinion, but I would put 'Hard' in the top 10."
1,Mediocre Effects Capsize a Laughably Simple Plot,"As you might expect, a blockbuster disaster movie usually lives or dies by the quality of its special effects. ""Poseidon,"" perhaps embracing this sensibility, storms right out of the gates with its money shot, a flyby tour of the doomed ship's exterior from all angles that might be half as impressive as it sounds. The CG looks like a student reel, amateurish and fake with goofy footage of soon-to-be hero Josh Lucas jogging the upper decks awkwardly crammed in. It's a downhill slide from there as a thin plot yields to the power of impressive post-production effects to bail it out, and the cavalry never manages to arrive. A surprisingly star-studded cast struggles with one dimensional characters, banal ""here's what I'm looking at"" dialog and plot twists so by-the-book I was able to accurately predict each on-screen death. It's a bland, generic, cash-in of a remake that isn't even afforded the buoy of good eye candy. Don't bother."
1,Not worth the money,"To those of you thinking about buying a movie about a sea disaster, this film is in no way worth they money. Buy the original instead. When compared to this dud, the original is a classic. And besides this film does not have the famous death scene with Shelley Winters."
2,What a dissappointment,"Take it from a big fan of disaster movies, AVOID this mess. The script is poorly written, the charcters are protrayed as morons. Visual effects are only fair, this was a waste of film time and the money it cost to produce the entire piece of poorly written and acted cinema."
2,At least Kurt still has Goldie,"This is a great flick for people who are irritated by sub-plots because there are none. There is nothing resembling reality found anywhere in this movie, so it makes for excellent escapism, which we all need now and then. Since all the characters stay together, it is easy to follow along, so you can turn your brain off, it won't be needed. Since it's all about the ship, acting wasn't necessary. You can bet that movies like this toll the bell for the careers of Russell and Dreyfus. I felt pity for them as actors, and hope they can rebound. The movie is shorter than most, so there will be minimum impact on your life. You will remember nothing about it soon after exposure."
2,Remake with all flash but no soul,"Ugghhh.... 40 minutes into this remake disaster, we hit the EJECT button.Yes... with modern effects the waves were bigger, the flames bigger the explosions were bigger.....So what was missing ?SOUL and a concern about the characters.The remake was all ""flash"" and ""effects"" with no ""life"" to the characters.Unlike the original with Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, etc...In this remake you simply don't care if the main characters live or die..... nor do you get lost in the movie."
3,"A Decent Disaster Film, but Catch it on DVD","I must say that the acting is average at best, though Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell try to elevate it, and the dialogue is below average. Emmy Rossum is pretty bad here, but at least she looks good. If you go to a movie about a ship that flips over due to a 100 foot wave that pops up out of nowhere, leaving people trying to make it the top (actual bottom) of the ship, are you really expecting good acting and dialogue? The special effects are good, but I still can't figure out where the 160 million dollar budget went. It is fast paced and entertaining at times. I didn't feel like I wanted my money back when I left the theater, but then again I knew what to expect going in. Can't wait to see The Da Vinci Code, X-Men III, Superman Returns, and Pirates of the Caribbean 2. It's gonna be a fun summer at the movies!"
4,A worthy remake,"I went and saw this in IMAX the night it came out and was very impressed. The CGI was amazing, one of my friends afterward actually asked me if the Poseidon was a real ship! My only dissapointment was the script was lame in some parts, but other then that, a great movie. And btw, for those of you that didn't bother going to see it in theaters, you missed out big time. Watching the sequence where the Poseidon gets struck and rolled by the rogue wave was the coolest scene i've seen in movies. Period."
2,"Too Concise, More depth of the characters please","Having seen the original Poseidon Adventure back in its initial release in 1972, I was disappointed in this remake. The Special effects are great and intensify the experience for the viewer but, it lacks in depth of its characters.It is not explained why the ""rogue wave "" (todays definition of a tidal wave)occurred and the characters themselves have far less depth than that of the original therefore,it is hard to connect with them. This lack of depth mirrors todays society as there is little, if any delay of gratification. Its more like lets get right to the point so we can get it over with."
1,A Titanic blockbuster,"The producers of this movie may believe that all the special effects make it unsinkable, but after hitting multiple icebergs of bad plot, bad dialogue, bad character development, even bad background music and a bad torch song, it sinks like a lead zeppelin. The special effects were fine, but I can't say they were better than the special effects in the 1972 version. I can't believe that the same director who did Das Boot and The Perfect Storm did this; it is not Wolfgang Petersen's style to keep things moving from one special effects crisis to the next. This film is the most pathetic so far this year, and I hope it doesn't even garner any special effects Oscar nominations; it's better left on the bottom of the sea and forgotten. There may be survivors in the story, but there are none in the audience."
3,"Good FX, but lacks character","""The Poseidon Adventure"" is one of my favourite movies of the 1970's. I remember seeing it as a teenager several times in Sydney at the Plaza on George Street (alas no longer). Although this remake has some awesome special FX's it really lacks heart and dramatic tension between the characters that was the essence to the original. Although I was on the edge of my seat throughout the film, I didn't care much for the characters and their plight. The original had humour and heart, this has a lot a incredible effects and that's all. I was looking forward to seeing this version and was not dissappointed, but it pales by comparison to the original version."
1,I've Seen Better Film On Teeth,"It's a herculean task to tell this story in only 98 minutes, and the filmakers didn't even come close. It starts out exactly like a cheesy Love Boat episode. I was expecting to see Julie, the cruise director, with clipboard in hand chatting with the lame passengers while Gopher, Dr. Bricker and Isaac chase the bikini clad babes.The acting was so God awful as were the hokey CGI effects. I was surprised that Wolfgang Petersen would have his hand in this bag of crap after doing a great job with The Perfect Storm. The characters were all losers I couldn't really relate to nor care about. The story jumped around too much to keep my attention.... making me keep checking the clock to see when this cruise will finally end.The whole plot was completely predictable and un-imaginative. I am so happy I rented this sloppy mess instead of buying it!"
3,Bad Idea,"Normally in a disaster movie theres a half-hour to an hour where we meet the characters and get to know all about them. It is necessary for the disaster scenario to have its full effect on the audiences. But the clever writer for Poseidon had the great idea to meet the characters for about 5 or 10 minutes than have the big wave come. Bad idea. I did not even care about any of the characters. By the end of the movie you don't really care anymore. The special effects are stunning, but I expected a lot more from Wolfgang Peterson(Air Force One, Troy). Don't pay to see this, rent it when it comes out. If you want a good summer movie go see Mission Impossible 3."
4,"Not a favorite in this house, but don't let that stop you","I liked this book; I still do. But it was never a hit with my kids. You can usually tell which board books are popular by how worn they become. This one still looks like new. So either Houghton Mifflin developed some kind of breakthrough spit-resistant cardboard, or this one simply wasn't a favorite.Perhaps theoriginalnon-board book version is longer and does a better job of involving the reader with the eponymous ducks? Because I think the emotional bond evident in something likeToot & Puddleis missing here.Dunrea's illustrations are charming. And the book's message is worthwhile: Friends can be different and still be friends. I would not hesitate to buy this again, but this time for a friend's baby shower gift.3.5 stars"
4,monologues,"got this for my son to read, he likes tv and movies. he enjoys comedy and this book provides many little short tales to tell."
3,Promising new talent,I purchased this after hearing a song on Carly Simon's new CD. He's a promising new writer. Looking forward to more.
4,"Superb animation, believable characterisation","When their children throw them out at Christmas in favour of more modern toys, a teddy and a doll called pigtails team up to go and find children who can love them. This is the story of their adventures along the way. A charming tale."
3,Review of Erven's Fire Fighting Apparatus and Procedures,"Our Fire Department has used this book as a resource for testing our Driver/Operators for several years. Since it has not been updated since 1979, quite a bit of the material is now out of date or no longer up to NFPA standards. Parts of the book are still good reference, such as the pump and hydraulics sections. There are now other references that are quite good, too. The new IFSTA ""Pumpng Apparatus Driver/Operator Handbook"", appears to have excellent sections on pumps and procedures and trouble shooting. Not quite the depth on hydraulics, though. Even this 1999 edition does not have as much up to date information as I would like on topics such as electric pump systems. I suspect that the days of Erven's classic text are are numbered, unless a new edition is written."
2,Loud and cheap,I was very disappointed with this product. It is very loud when it is on and makes an annoying noise (almost like an ice cream maker) as it turns. It does not cast a lot of light and is almost pointless. I gave it 5 stars for durability because it held up to my very curious boys picking it up and dropping it wondering why it was so boring. Think of it as a dimly lit picture of Lighning McQueen spinning around inside of a ball.
4,Very Suspenseful.....,"I thought the book was very interesting right from the start. The story is very intriguing, and i found myself wanting to finish it in one sitting! I did however find many unanswered questions- which I hope will be answered in her future books."
2,Four Star General with a two star rating,"For the first third of the book I thought I was going to enjoy a first rate autobiography of a top military figure. But, beyond the first 200 pages the book start to languish. Suddenly you realize that this book is more about propaganda supporting the Bush administration's decision to invade Iraq than it is about a military career. Over and over again General Tommy tells the reader that George and Don can do no wrong. He also informs us of his battle strategy using small forces that move quickly to win the war. But, lo and behold, the general up and retires before the war is won. No explanation why he decides to retire when he hasn't even yet reached 60 years old. This book just left me empty. I would not recommend it."
5,American Soldier,"We got this book for my Dad for Fathers Day. He loved it. He read it in about two days, he said he couldn't put it down."
5,In the Danger Zone,"General Franks really did a good job on this book, its deep, real and thought provoking to say the least. To me this book has really brought to life the meaning of service to God and County, Honor and Strength. I am buying two more copies for my sons who both serve in the military. I want them to know the view from a real soldiers eyes, as seen by him. Give it a read, you will at least really enjoy it, if not be moved deeply.."
3,Show me Osama,"Gen. Tommy Franks does not provide an adequate answer to explain the appalling US Military failure at Tora Bora when bin Laden was in our cross-hairs. We shouldn't blame Gen. Franks because he did not dream up the attack plan (It was George Tenet's Baby,) but to fail to address this crucial issue creates a major gap in this otherwise entertaining read. Afterall, it was Franks' senior commander, Pres. Bush, who vowed to get him ""dead or alive."" Mission not YET accomplished. Happy Retirement, Tommy."
4,a must read,"Tommy Ray aka.Gen Franks..takes you into a moment by moment expose of the preparations of war, both as a soldier and as a nation. This is a powerful presentation by a true American. A must read!!!"
3,Ok for what it was,"I've been trying to buy all of Martin Boyle's ""Lighthouses of England and Wale"" series and this is the 4th out of 7 that I've bought.To be positive I believe that this is the only book about or even featuring a write up on the Needles Point light, at least that I've come across. However, I was not happy to see that this book was only 24 pages in length compared to the standard 40-44 pages of his other books. The photos were great as usual (though no interior) and the writing was of high quality. Maybe there is just not that much history with Needles Point! I definitely enjoyed the book, I'd just caution others to be careful about how much they spend on this book because it is only half the length of the other's in the series."
1,These gates are junk,These gates where given to me as I first put in my dust collection system and I can see why. If they aren't clogged up they are falling apart as I clean all the sawdust that got jammed up in the groove the gate slides into. I've replaced all of them within 3 months of installing them. Now all the dust they collect is taking up space on my shelf in my shop while I figure out who I hate the most so I can pass them on.
2,A pain to maintain.,These blast gates clog and are difficult to clean. After trying to get used to them they're going to be given away. I hate these gates. They suck.
4,A solid album and her best.,"This album is good compare to her first one. There were some filler's on her debut, whereas every song on here is listen able. I have to say the highlight is the ending song ""Change"" which is accompanied by a gospel chorus. The others are good as well.My other favorable tracks are:*In my Mind - One of the best ballads on the cd*Wait a Minute*I didn't mean to*How many ways*What's not being said*The letter*Me time - nice lyricsOverall this album is straight. I think if there was a stronger effort to bring in different sounds with a little more creative, better producers, and writers,....it would of came out as a 5 star cd but definitely a solid album at best. Fans and non fans might want to check this out."
4,Nice Tunes,I would buy this album all over again. I liked the lyrics and music.The only song that did not seem to fit was the doo wop song. I still don't feel that one.
5,Blows me away!,"I ran out and purchased this CD today and have been jamming to it ever since. ""In my mind"" just blows me away, ""wait a minute"" is another that brings out her vocal talents. Then there's her shoo-wop song ""back when it was"", ""rain"" with Shaggy is sure to be a hit and last but not least is ""change"" which shows her gospel side. I highly recommend this CD to all."
3,"FLAWED, YET WORTH OWNING","Basil, (Leto) is a sequestered young Englishman, with modest knowledge of life when he meets Manion, (Slater) who opens the remarkable, seductive entryway of both living and passion to the easily influenced Basil.Fast-paced in an enervated way, the opening is startling one dimensional enough to be painful. Mercifully, it gathers momentum and becomes if not intriguing, certainly, not characterless or tedious.Slater, is suitable; Leto comes with a certain distance wholly appropriate for the part. Foriani (Julia) was capable enough for me to want to throttle her character...a very good sign I'd say.Clearly, the tempo was off, nonetheless, as the plot unfolded (for those of us who haven't read the book)'Basil' becomes more low-key melodrama and middle-end gothic, in very pleasing and agreeable way, as the threads of the narrative are sorted out.I was quite keen on 'Basil'."
3,OD is 2 1/2 to inch.,"As stated above, this reducer will not connect a 2 1/2"" hose to a 4"" outlet of a dust collector. Some other reviews said it did, so I ordered it anyway. I solved the problem by getting a rubber plumbing connector from the hardware store and attached the two together. The 4"" side needs a 3"" rubber connector. It is a very tight fit, and took some time to get it on, but it worked great and now I do not have to worry about stress on the hose at the machine end because the rubber pipe connector is flexible. All and all it worked out. I lowered the points because the company should have explained this in the place."
5,Works for me,"This device is designed to work with your 2 1/2"" shop vac hose. The large end is for attaching a piece of flexible tubing, and the small end is for attaching your shop vac. I have it attached to my Rigid 4512 tablesaw: flex tube from the saw port to the large end of the reducer, then attach the shop vac to the small end. Secured with worm clamps. Works like it's supposed to for me."
5,smooth transition,From Australia's premier rocker. He belted out songs as frontman of Cold Chisel and is still belting them out with his very successful solo career so how does a cd of soul music sound with the Barnes touch? Excellent! Jimmy adds a new dimention to already classic songs and even teams up with other popular Aussies like Diesel and John Farnham. The key to this cd is that Jimmy performs the tracks as Jimmy Barnes not as someone trying to mimic others. Still big Barnes sound but this time with less guitar and a bit more brass backup. He stays true to the original recordings but just spices them up and gets them rocking. A surprisingly fantastic recording and his follow up (Soul Deeper) is just as good.
4,Good for high intermediate and advanced,"This is an excellent resource to listen to various native speakers. The DVD is interesting. Reminded me a lot of the kind of documentaries you see on Japanese TV. The accompanying text is in hiragana, with very little English. I found myself struggling to get most of the conversations. I think you should be very high intermediate level or advanced to find this book useful."
4,Great wedding box!,"This box is simple and pretty. It can hold A LOT of cards, and over-sized envelopes fit in easily. There is no lock on it and no way to lock it, so that might be an issue for someone; but the lid is fairly heavy and it wasn't an issue for us."
5,Absolutely Fabulous,"This is an absolutely beautiful book. I have enjoyed looking at it over and over again, and it has given me some wonderful ideas for decorating. John Terrell Fry is ever so clever and creative and Nancy Nolan is an unbelievably talented photographer! Makes a great Christmas Gift for anyone on your list!"
5,It's Tasteless!,"My teenagers love Ren & Stimpy! I purchased this video as a holiday stocking stuffer and we had to dig a VCR out of the closet to watch it. I wish it was available on DVD, but it was well worth the effort. Beware that it isn't for children, but if you love the Ren & Stimpy series you will love this video!"
3,pvc,running pvc pipe for dust collection is dangerous if you don't ground it the plastic builds up a very large amount ot static which can be explosive in a wood working shopperry
1,Poor Dust Hose,This item is the worst mail order item I have ever recieved. Both the picture and the Edititorial Review are very misleading. You need to be careful when you remove it from the box as even the slightest catch will tear the thin membrane.If not for the dire need I have I would return it. As it is I plan on throwing it out as soon as a real dust collection hose arives from Trend-Lines.
4,you get what you pay for,"For the price, you can't complain about this hose. However, you should know that this hose will not hold up under a lot of suction. When I put a 4"" to 2 1/2"" adapter on it want's to pull together. Like I said though, you can't complain for the price."
5,Flex Hose bargain,"I was rather hesitant about purchasing this product based on a negative review I read - but I took the gamble and was happy I did. I have the stiff stuff already and was real tired of dealing with it. This hose is a heavier grade dryer hose that is not only easy to use but appears to be a lot more rugged than than it looks. I have replaced all my semi rigid plastic flex hose with this product and it works great, fits in places the other stuff won't and hasn't sprung a leak nor torn yet - even with all the dragging around I do with it to sweep up my shop. For the price you can't go wrong."
3,4 inch Dust collection hose,"Good quality. Works fine, moves when establishing vacuum. Very flexible."
1,Terrible Quality,"Movies 1,2 and 3 freeze up and so I'm not able to watch them. Should've known the deal was too good. I thought amazon would put out a better product than this. I read others had the same issues with them. Makes me think twice before buying something from amazon now."
2,DVDs not in great condition.,Did not come in the original box. All four of the DVDs were stacked on top of each other in one DVD box.
5,VERY funny - I keep having to buy it - if you lend it out you'll never see it again!,"Am buying this for perhaps the fifth time. Great series from the UK and Ireland. Three priests (not very good ones!) are exiled to Craggy Island for their misdemeanors and live together in a parish house. This series is about their lives and times. Catholic friends from Ireland, Austria, Germany, and New York all have loved this show. I bet you will, too!"
3,Tough to produce,I'm sure they are all good...but I guess I was expecting simipler preparation....sigh....the good stuff is always so difficult.
3,Novelty at best,"My sister is a HUGE fan of Emeril's cooking show and restaurants around the country. I got her this cookbook for Christmas and she was so excited when she opened it. However, the recipe's in there require at least a professional chef to decifer!! It all sounds good in theory but when we tried one of the most basic recipes (Chicken Broth!), it turned out to be a disaster. Now the book is collecting dust on the bookshelve."
5,A Great Cookbook!,"I now have more than 380 cookbooks, more than half I use with some frequency. This book, along with Emeril""s Domenico""s cookbook, are outstanding and are shelved next to my stove (limited to the 20 or so that I refer to the most often."
4,Excellent multicultural counseling resource,"Very thorough, balanced viewpoints, useful chapter sections (especially the exercises at the end of each chapter), and empirically supported throughout. Also really like that each chapter is written by a different author, so you get a lot of different viewpoints and writing styles. Definitely recommend to anyone needing to teach a multicultural counseling course or strengthen their own multicultural counseling competencies."
4,EXCELLENT DOCUDRAMA,A fine film in documentary style about the Manhattan Project and the building of the fist three atomic bombs.The one flaw I noticed was the casting of the actor to play the role of General George C. Marshall who was Chief of Staff at the time and later became the Secretary of State Marshall was tall and lean with an imposing stature. The actor here was short and stout and about as imposing as Bud Abbot. The casting director should have done his homework better.
2,"looks nice, flimsy","Not as sturdy as my old one which was rusting -- the entire pole bows out a bit and I can't get it to stay straight. The shelves are nice, I like the soap tray and the small hooks are a nice touch, but the baskets sag/tilt badly off of the pole, still usable, but barely."
5,I love my shower caddy!,"I would definitely recommend this shower caddy. My shower was cramped with all the bottles everywhere and this has make things so much nicer. It is sturdy, I like the dark color, and the luffa hooks. Also, whenever I have guests stay over, they always ask me where I got my caddy because of how nice it is."
2,"marginally adequate, but low quality","luckily, I didn't need all of the extensions, because one of them bent like a wire hanger the first time I tried to install it in the shower. Even using the shorter length extension with the rig, I ended up cutting off another inch and a half just to make sure the pressure would not bend another rod. It's still bowing. I've used similar products of this type in other bathtubs/showers, but this is the flimsiest one I have come across so far. I do not expect it to last very long.It will do the job of holding a couple things in the shower, but the shelves are relatively small (i.e. one large bottle of shampoo or two small bottles will fit on a shelf).It's also worth noting that the spring was missing from the original packaging. Zenith's customer service was quick about sending the missing part to me, so kudos for that."
4,Very satisfied,"Easy to install (we have a tub) and has better features compared to most other models/brands we looked at. Product is metal but the finish doesn't match stainless, crome, or nickle metal fixtures. It holds a lot of items including several large shampoo/conditioner bottles and a wooden handled back brush/scrubber along with everything else you'd need in the shower. The shelves all stay in place no problem."
4,i love it... now...,"I got this shower caddy because it was exactly what I wanted!However, when I started to put it together, I realized it was way too tall for a shower caddy unless it was standing from the floor to the ceiling. I wanted it to go between the top of the tub and the ceiling.. not to mention that was extremely awkward from the floor of the tub to the ceiling so I figured I would take out one of the rods. Then it was too short. After some finagling and frustration I finally figured out a way to make it work. I think they should give different options for different heights.However, if you were going to use this in a shower stall or something; it would be perfect.So, I love it now that it's in place... But, it took days to figure out a way to make it work for me."
1,Naxos strikes again,Well-intentioned but remarkably stiff and unsubtle performance. Mr. Cummings seems uncomfortable and unfamiliar in this territory. Naxos does not serve music-lovers fairly with this type of recording.
2,Dissapointed,'If these walls could talk' was dissapointing. It was too disjointed for me to gat any real understanding of the message. I would not suggest any of my peers to purchase the dvd.
5,so good!,"Such a great trilogy. You laugh, you cry. You go awwwww. :) I could watch it over and over again. The spanning of generations of love. :)"
5,Great mouse,"This is my home mouse.I like it because it has 2 buttons you can click on (thumb side and finger side), as well as a nice comfortable feel in your hands.It's bright blue, so you can't lose it, and is relatively inexpensive.Great product. Its one of the 4 mouses I use to rotate as treatment for repetitive stress.(My hand specialist said to use a different mouse, every week/ or day, and to alternate hands)"
3,Wish I'd read the reviews!,"Ordered these in the same size as my other Crocs sandals and was surprised that they were noticeably smaller. I see now that the other reviews mention that you should order a size larger. Instead, maybe Crocs should be consistent in their sizing. They still barely fit, just one size larger would have been perfect. And I notice Amazon doesn't offer free returns on these (while they do on other clothing items). Otherwise they seem outstanding."
4,Crocs Men's Modi Flip Sandal,"Great sandals!! I wear them to take walks in, comfortable and light but give me pretty good arch support for a sandal. Would definitely recommend these for casual sandals."
4,Love my Modi Flip Flops,This is my 3rd pair of Modi's they are soo comfortable and I think stylish. I would normally have given a 5 star rating but this particular pair is a little smaller then previous purchases of the same size.
5,Good Replacement for Croc Athens Flip Flops,Very comfortable - from the very first wear. Good replacement for Croc Athens Flip Flops.
1,Foot bed is peeling off,"I had purchased this sandal August 2011, because it received such good reviews. My review/update is based on 6 months of use which is mainly at home while taking shower. Over the past couple months, I had noticed that the sole or foot bed of the sandal is getting unglued. I don't know if this is because I used it in shower or it is due to other issues. But for this problem, the sandals are comfortable. My experience might be of help to others considering my use case.I would have like to attach a photo attachment, if it was possible. I will see if I can do so on the product link page."
4,From the cover,"From the back of the book:In this fascinating and original book, the author develops his theory of inspiration starting with texts as varied as Virgil's Aeneid and Shakespeare's plays, before focusing on the Bible. Following Karl Jaspers, the author views all human knowledge as having limits beyond which there exists the transcendent. There are symbols, signs, and characters-or ""ciphers""-that inhabit religion and art, and which point beyond these horizons. Perceiving these is at the heart of inspiration and the knowledge of God. For the author, the key to the question of inspiration and to the Bible lies with understanding the reader's encounter with these ciphers, the most supreme of which is Christ."
5,"Absolutely Amazing, and So Helpful....","As someone who suffers with depression and wrestles with spiritual issues, this book has touched me like no other. It took me several days just to get past page three. Each small meditation is an incredible truth that could drastically change a life.I will be reading and re-reading these thoughts until they are ingrained in me, until I can call them to my mind and work them out in my life. These reflections will ring true in your heart, and they will call to your long-lost inner voice of love and guidance. Spiritual tensions make sense here, they have a place, an ordered place in personal life.I struggle with the sadness and the promise of joy; I struggle with the darkness and the light, with my needs and the Giver. And this book brings discordant parts of our lives into harmony with one another. It helps me make sense of my life and myself. And that is a true gift."
1,Warning!,"Henri Nouwen's book, The Inner Voice of Love, is nothing short of New Age philosophy, and I would not recommend this book to any Bible-believing Christian. (I rated this book with one star because there were no options less than that available on this form.)"
2,Teaser,"This book was mentioned to me by a friend in love with Italy and italian culture as a possible insight of the medioeval time.The title is a teaser. The chapter related to the Medici is just buried in the middle of the book.It is just another story about animals ""in captivity"".If I knew I would never have purchesed."
5,Best in it's class,"Of all the major brands we have purchased for our Sears HE Machine, this bar far the best and non allergic. Works well and I would highly recommend it."
5,Washes clean,"It's hard to find in stores, so I order through Amazon. It washes clean, works on HE, and cheap when bought through the Subcription."
2,Shipping problems!,"While I love this product, I would not try to have it shipped until the shipping packaging is improved. They tried to send it to me 3-4 times and each time there would be some type of leak and package damage causing the package not to be delivered."
5,well connected,"I must admit that the only reason I'm reviewing this product is because I can use the Title ""Well connected"". And that is what it does and it does it as advertised 4"" to 4"" connection. What more can I say than I am better connected to my dust collection system than I was before and that is a good thing."
2,Comments from the spiritual reviewer,"This book would appeal to readers who want reinforcement of traditional Christian thinking and who don't mind hearing a new version of the same old message. Lucado's inability to probe even slightly below the surface of cliches and the established party line results in a shallow and unsatisfying reading experience. Additionally, Lucado's ideas about love and attack are co-mingled. Ultimately, this confuses the reader about the meaning of love.A Love Worth Giving received a score of 3.875 on a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high) from the spiritual reviewer."
4,A Little Disappointing,"I don't want to be unfair to this production, but I had just seen Le Miz staged at the Bass Performance Hall in Dallas and wanted to hear some of the songs again. This fell so far short of seeing it beautifully staged. I looked for a DVD that had the production staged rather than merely having it sung by performers in costume but couldn't find any--maybe I missed it. Any way, if you've still got a VHS player, this is a great way to get the music for a reasonable price."
5,Must See!,"If you have never seen Les Mis - for shame! If you are already a fan, you will love this DVD. All the best of the best, in a semi-staged concert version of the show."
5,Not Miserable At All,"It's the next best thing to being there. The emotion and brilliance of music and acting are wonderfully conveyed. I was pleased with the sound and quality of the DVD, also.Nice bonus to get the various ValJeans from around the world!"
5,Stirring performances,Almost as good as seeing the stage show. Fabulous music performed by the best. It's great.
1,Complaint over wrong merchandise. No star deserved,"I have previously reviewed the product. I have complained that you have sent a product which hails from USA and cannot be used in EU.This policy is also against the rules of the EU tradecommission, in as much as notice must be given if you deliver products hailing from outside EU. I will refer this whole matter to The Danish Council for Consumer Protection, in order that they can warn other potential buyers of Amazon products. I have also requested an e-mail address from Amazon.com, whereto I can send my evidence that the delivery is faulty through no error of mine. I have received no reply.Furthermore I have no address to which I can return the merchandice. So I am now out some 452 danish kroner for a totally useless product.Sincerely, Henning W. Jakobsen, discruntled former customer ."
5,I dreamed a dream... and it came true after I saw this video,"It is so rare that you get the opportunity to see some of the worlds best prefromers in their best roles ever, let alone in one show. This performance is quailty and yet it doesn't spoil the musical for those who haven't seen it. It's more of a concert than it is a musical, but it is spectacular! This is a must buy! There are few words to describe it, but I loved it so much I bought the CD too! Enjoy!"
5,GREAT,"For those of you who want a straight-to-the-point review of this video, here you go. Orchestra: incredible. Colm Wilkinson: goose-bumpingly good. Philip Quast: too evil (Javert's a cop doing his job, not Satan) but great voice. Ruthie Henshall: heart wrenchingly beautiful voice. Lea Salonga: great voice but too bitter. Michael Ball: adorable, incredible voice as usual. No one can touch him on this. Michael Maguire: sexy face, repulsive voice. Where was Anthony Warlow? Judy Kuhn: sounds better on the Broadway recording. They transposed ""In My Life"" and it sounds yucky. Jenny Galloway: Incredibly hilarious. Alun Armstrong: Incredibly annoying. Costumes: Beautiful. Sets: none. Anybody who wants to e-mail me and talk ""Les Mis"", please do."
4,Not the same as seeing it live,"This is worth viewing if you love the musical. It may be the ""dream cast"" to some people, but many great performers who have starred in Les Mis were not featured in this video. I would have liked to see Frances Ruffelle as Eponine, and Leo Burmester who is the best Thenardier. Luckily, Michael Maguire who plays a great Enjolras is in the video. And, of course, the great Colm Wilkinson is in it.It's a must to listen to the soundtrack on CD (there are different recordings, and the original Broadway cast is wonderful) as the sound quality is better than in this video."
5,"Grand, epic, over-the-top concert!","This is the most amazing concert I have ever seen! The all-star cast, featuring singers from around the world, put on an excellent performance. One man tops them all: COLM WILKINSON. The greatest voice the world has ever known.If there is such a thing as perfect - This is it!"
4,"Robin Williams Design Workshop, 2nd Edition","Very good book ... layed out nicely and contains very good information and examples. It was a pleasant, easy read and I would recommend this book."
2,"Simplistic, unrealistic","I was disappointed to read this book. Nye basically argues that the world has become very complex due to the global information age and that even though the US will remain as the world superpower in the coming decades, it is in its best interest to pursue multilateralism instead of unilateralism (altough he recognizes that ""at times we will have to go it alone"").It's really hard to argue with Nye's argument, because on paper it sounds very true. Unfortunately, this book does not address the practical matters of foreign policy in the first decade of the XXI century.I bought this book expecting to find a practical, matter-of-factly counterpoint to the one spoused by the neoconservatives. I had previously read ""Of Paradise and Power"" (R.Kagan) and ""The Threatening Storm"" (K.Pollack). I wanted a counter-argument but I did not find it. I am still looking."
3,Needs a bit more...,"Having never heard of this author the background of the story is what pulled me in. I read the book in one sitting, and half way through it, all I kept thinking was ""Wow, this is a complete and total rip off of Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series!"" with very few exceptions. Granted I'm a fan of LKH, but I enjoyed this book as well mostly because the author doesn't delve into...shall we say the porno realm that LKH is now mired in?Worth the read and very enjoyable, but you'll be able to tie everything to Anita Blake if you've read that series."
2,dissapointing,"this isnt what it seems - while there is a bunch of stuff on the types of clothes in the world, it doesn't tell you what to wear to work. my husband liked maximum style much more."
4,The Beauty of being Numb...,"Being a natural cynic, i ordered this book more with the idea of picking holes in every single arguement it put forward, rather than as a serious interest of mine. When i recieved it, my first reaction was, "" my god, what a cheezy cover!"". Not being one to judge a book by the proverbial, however, i soon delved into the dubious pleasures inside... and was actually pleasantly surprised. Instead of preaching to the unconverted or unconvertable, Mr Cavendish has put forward a fine, well researched report into many different areas of the ""black arts"", from numerology to black magic, without sounding pretentious or subscribing to the usual ""bow down to your master"" playground psychology that these sort of authors usually find themselves hankering after. Hence he makes the book not only readable, but also very enjoyable, and in parts even made me wonder if there was more to all this mumbo-jumbo than first meets the eye. Well done, sir!"
5,really nice ring,"i love this ring. it is very well made. i bought it a little to big, that's my only regret. i can still fit it but is slips. that's the only thing that keeps me from wearing it everyday. my only advice is to make sure you know your correct ring size, you'll want to wear this one!"
3,doesnt fit with Makita planer,"Bought this for my makita planer. It does not fit... looks like it is well made and probably does work well with right fittings, but if your looking for it to go on Makita planer then save yourself a few bucks... dont know how to rate this item because it is useless so far.. I hope this info is useful to some people. if anyone knows what fitting will fit the makita then please reply with comment."
4,Once Upon A Star,"This collection of short stories is a sequel of sorts to last years short story collection, Once Upon a Castle, and unlike most story collections there is not a stinker story in it. These are imaganitive short romance's that feature a star as an important part of the story line and a fantasy element to each of the short romances."
4,The Best of These Collaborations I've Read,"I've been working my way through the ""Once Upon a..."" anthologies--which I read in paperback once upon a time. ; ) Of the ones I've read so far (Also read Once Upon a Castle, Once Upon a Dream), I thought this was the overall best of them.I loved Catch a Falling Star by Jill Gregory--but the others were close.The one caveat and what cut the rating down to a four star review is the title and theme of ""stars"" was a stretch. In the one story, the only real link to stars was the main character's name Estelle. The stories were good. The writing excellent--which you'd expect from these ""stars."" (See... I can do it too.) I just thought it was silly to try and throw them together in a themed anthology with such a shaky connection."
3,Some cool concepts,"Dark Floors was about what I imagined it to be, a zany escapade through a bleak hospital. It was the monster imagery that drew ,e to this film and I thought the movie used some creative monsters and ghosts to run rampant among the halls. I am still not sure exactly what happened or what the movie was trying to say, but I liked some of the concepts and the feeling of suspense. I would have appreciated a more sound explanation, but overall am enjoyable scary flick for an hour and half."
1,"I wanted to throw this movie on the ""floor"".. and stomp on it.","In the beginning, I thought this movie was going to be good. It had some interesting scenes and an eerie sort of vibe. However, it runs out of steam after while.. and the story made no sense whatsoever in the end. They left you guessing what it was all about and never explained a single thing. One of the ending scenes looked like it was written by a fifth grader who loved Disney.. I guess the big pay off for some with this movie was some heavy metal band dressed as the monsters. But for the rest of us it just made you want to give the DVD away as soon as the end credits began to roll. The only scary thing about this movie was the writters inability to maintain a good story as the script progressed."
3,WTF????,"This is a confusing review for me to do, as I can not say the movie made any sense, but yet, somehow it's watchable and entertaining.A somewhat autistic girl comes out of a cat scan and for no apparent reason her, her father and a few others end up in the twilight zone as they become stuck in time/in a parallel universe/in a time loop... it's hard to decipher what the heck is going on. While they confront a ghost, demons ripped off of Predator and the Mummy and zombies while trying to find a way out of this dark hospital.Like I said, this movie made no sense to me, why it's happening, what the point of the ending is or if anything at all made any sense, and usually i'd rate a movie like that very low, but somehow, it was entertaining."
1,Ugh..,"O.k. first the good stuff. The look of the movie is pretty spooky, the FX are pretty cool, the score is what you would expect, and the acting isn't all that bad. Now the bad stuff. The rest of the movie! There is not much of a story to speak of, no character development, the writing is just awful, there isn't even that much gore. It seems that this is a vehicle to promote a Heavy Metal band from Finland called Lordi. Remember Gwar? Same thing. A group of self proclaimed rock stars in stupid monster costumes. The plot has something to do with a little girl living in a nightmare, or just having one, you really can't tell which one. I even saw some of the plot from ""Silent Hill"" in there for some reason. This is a sad attempt to cash in on the bands popularity, nothing more."
1,AT LAST A COOKBOOK FOR FOOD SNOBS,"If I were a food snob, I would love this cookbook. If I had all of the proper pots, pans and containers, I would love this cookbook. If I had a kitchen the size of my house, I would love this cookbook.If however I were looking for recipes that could be prepared and cooked on a timely basis and that my family and friends would enjoy, I would hate this cookbook. What a disappointment. Here is a well known chef who has national recognition and yet she literally alienates herself from the majority of the population by making it clear that most of us eat like pagans. But that's okay since there are so many other cookbooks out there with wonderful recipes that most of us would enjoy that you should buy.And for the the minority of you whom this book was obviously written for and who likes to cook with mascarpone, lobster, octopus, duck, quail, farro, celery root, quince or anything in Italian or French then put your order in today."
1,"Making a pitch, not savoring a story","I have the uneasy impression Betty Lukens is taking a stand somehow instead of opening the creation story to the imaginations of children. She picks a certain part of the Genesis story, and adds her own details. She capitalizes pronouns for God, which most reputable scripture translations do not. And she ends ""creation week"" without a single mention of the seventh day. She says, we don't know how God did it ..."" but we do. He spoke it. That's an important part of the story.I have only read this exerpt, but I have seen the huge amount of felt picture stuff that comes with it. I wonder why she chose that material-intensive method of telling the old, old story?"
4,A helpful and interesting read,"I bought this book after a friend recommended it to me. My husband and I have both read it together and have enjoyed seeing the results of following the blood-type diet.I do not agree with the evolutionary theory involved in explaining the blood-types, but the effects of the diets are incredible. It is easy to read and follow although it explains scientific facts."
1,Not for the average person,"This book is poorly written and the shopping list is hard to fill in a small town. I am not driving 90 miles to go grocery shopping. The diet probably works, but if you can't get through the book to find out how to diet it won't work. I did the Atkin's diet and lost 30 lbs in just over a month and have kept the weight off for over a year. My blood type is O and the low carb/high protien diet is the one for me. I thought I would try the other diets for the other family members. My suggestion is to try the library first and see if it is a book you can use. I have wasted my money!"
1,A load of crap,"My wife (type O) -- age 60+, moderately obese, diabetic -- bought this nonsense on the recommendation of a nutty family member. For twelve months she has followed the rules in this book to the letter. Lost zero pounds, had no effect on her blood glusoce level, blood pressure, cholesterol, or triglycerides. I'm the same age, type A-NEG. I ignore the book, eat what I want, drink what I want, all in moderation. I rarely eat red meat and avoid sweets, except for lots of fruit. I run 8 miles a day, pump iron -- bench press 245 -- blood pressure is 120/60, cholesterol in the low 150's, triglycerides normal and I take no medication of any kind -- well, except for a shot or two of Dr. Jack Daniels' elixir every day.Put down the book, stop looking for a magic bullet, get off your larda**, get off the couch, and move."
1,Shown to be non-scientific by many researchers,I would look at the critique of this dietary concept in The Food Revolution by John Robbins before buying into it. There is no scientific basis for the idea that diet should follow blood type. It would be similar to a book (yet to be written) stating that diet ought to correspond to hair color. Artificial foods would be recommended for people with dyed hair.
5,"To call it a ""Diet Book"" almost a disservice","This is a book about individuality that just happens to have a dietary component. A very good book, I might add"
5,awesome book,"this book helped me to figure out why i dont like some foods, and foods that i should avoid. i would totally recomend this book to buy and to read."
2,Eat Right 4 Your Type,"I initially entered this diet with much gusto as I wanted to lose around 20 pounds. As a type A, the recommended diet was a high vegetarian and carbohydrate diet. I followed the program for 6 weeks and _gained_ 10 pounds. I've since discovered I'm an insulin resistant person and the diet was making my situation worse. I'm now off the ER4YT diet and am following a low carb diet though I still stay away from red meat. I'm also finally starting to lose weight again."
4,A new way to look at food.,"I purchased this book since my Mom was so excited about this new diet. What I found the most interesting is the foods that I know I am allergic to, before I read this book, are the foods on the avoid list. The only hard part to the O Type diet is avoiding wheat. Wheat is in everything, almost. I try to avoid it when possible. I've also found that by avoiding the foods on the avoid list my stomach doesn't get upset all the time! And I've lost a few pounds too!"
4,VERY helpful book with a few recipes included,"I already wrote a review for Cook Right 4 Your Type, and if you want to go straight to the recipes, buy that one. This has more detailed information about the history of blood types, blood components and has the food charts and a few recipes. I like both books but the cookbook has more updated food listings and information. I do suggest getting both because you gain a better understanding of what this diet is all about."
3,Not Convinced,"I've seen references to ""eating for your blood type"" in several articles and books so I wanted to know what they were talking about. After reading, I am not completely convinced of the health benefits but am glad that now I know what the other articles were referring to. I didn't find this book as clear or easy to follow as I had hoped."
5,great read,I love to get different opinions on different subjects. I have tried this for my blood type and it works.
5,From a Type A ....,This diet has completely changed me inside and out! I started this diet about 4 months ago and was diagnosed shortly after with Polycystic Ovarian Disease. So I knew I had to get serious about my health and weight. Well I am pleased to say now that I have lost 25 pounds and have about 5 more to go! I have seen a huge improvement in my health as well. I truly believe that this is the diet everyone should use! One day the world and doctors will realize this! Thanks Dr. Adamo!
1,Errors in book,"I have only glanced at a friends copy, but that was all it took to discover that either A) the book is worthless, or B) the book is badly written. I am a gardener and seed saver so I have to know which species my veggies are so I won't get accidental crosses. The writer advises one type to eat turnips, but not chinese cabbage(or vice-versa). They are the same plant species, just different strains. Believe me, they cross, I have grown seed of crosses between the two, can I eat them or not? He advises type O to avoid cabbage, brussels sprouts and one other cabbage type plant, but says to eat kale, broccoli and collards. Again the same plant species. He advises one type to avoid solanacea, listing some as okay and others as not. All this done without any explanation. Do some solanacea species contain less solanine? I think the author better learn something about plants."
4,Highly Recommend!,"I've been into the practice of eating based on my blood type for nearly 20 years since I first stumbled on this way back then. This book is new and updated to today's healthy standards and is quite different in many respects, some disagreeable. I believe this is a way of life, and something to maintain as a regular eating habit not a ""diet"" by today's understanding of what a diet is.In my studies of nutrition, this the Blood Type Diet is a wonderful way to find and maintain your optimal healthy state of being.I'd like to see this book broken down further into the blood type sub-types."
1,disapointed,"I don't think much about this book and diet. It is likely to be a fad as it is too restrictive in what you may or may not eat. We get sick because of many factors, food is one but seriously, mangoes??? a fruit to be avoided by type A'a? That's just ridiculous. I wouldn't waste my time reading this. It just left me feeling confused and made the task of shopping much harder."
1,book,it's i think an outdated bk got it bcause want to compare to other bk i got ordered in nov. didn't receive until after christmaslongest it's ever taken 4 a product to reach me
2,Did not like,After reading the book I determined I didn't agree with it. I wouldn't have ordered the book had I known this.
2,Contradictory information,"I have read both the hard cover for all blood types, and the soft cover for just my blood type. There were so many contradictions that I began to write them all down in every catagory of information. For example, in one book it said that I should avoid Pinto beans, and in another it said that they were highly beneficial. I attempted to contact Dr. d'Adamo to clear all this up, however, wasn't able to reach him, so I just sold the books."
4,Good resource,"I liked this book, but I expected more lists of foods and some of the foods listed are a little crazy (like horse - I know why they listed it, but it seemed weird). It's a very easy read and I've shared it with friends already. We are trying to incoorperate some of the stuff that's supposed to be really good for us and eliminate some of the really bad things. It makes you think about what you eat. Overall, I would buy again."
1,In my experience it's a disaster,"I've followed his prescription to the T, but in my family's experience it's a disaster, the diet he prescribes for our bloody type (A) has not worked, a vegan and vegetarian diet has made us ill, created deficencies and we all gained weight and were always super hungry, and let me say that soy is evil!A balanced diet with dairy and more meat and fish has worked better, we eat 3 times a day plus 2 snacks and are never so hungry like before, it happens only when we eat a more veg meal."
5,the end all of diet books,"I have been through two years of misdiagnosis(depression, anxiety), and been on Paxil for 1.5 years, until I went to a homeopathic DR. who tested my blood and found I was suffering from reactive hypoglycemia. He suggested the ""blood type diet"", and I have been healthy since. This book corrolates to the diet sheet he gave me and I swear by it, it has saved my life."
5,EAT RIGHT FOR YOUR BLOOD,"Excellent. 4 of us are on this diet, A,O,B.It has changed my life; weight coming off, food delicious, lots of energy. The highly bens. and herbs are helping my insomnia. I recomend the Cook Right book."
4,Diet book,"This is a four in one book that covers the four blood types. The companion smaller books for each blood type are small in size large in content and great to take along with you when you go food shopping. A lot of the foods I like, don't like me according to this book and I agree with 93% of this point of view. This book and this serie of books are a fast read and another good reference for you to consider while building your life time diet plan."
5,Great Book!,"I have following my blood type (O) diet and it has improved my health considerably. I thank God for the information in this book and that I decided to read it before making any judgments. If I had only looked at the food list for my blood type without understanding the science behind it, I might not have thought there was anything to it. However,after reading the book, so much about diet and health has become clear. And the proof is in the pudding, not only do I feel better but my medical tests show that my condition is stabilizing. Read the book, follow Dr. D'Adamo's recommendations, and see for yourself."
4,Good accessories,Do your self a favor and purchase this item if you do heavy woodworking for example lathe work and plaining large stock down theres nothing worse than getting big shavings of wood on the floor. In my shop I have two because I use the lathe daily and hate wood shavings.
2,Awful,I found myself falling asleep everytime I picked up the book. I don't understand how Strauss could write a book on other people's feelings when he didn't live in their time. I expected it to be more a biography than a novel. (even though it says novel on the front cover).
3,Hoped for more,"When I read the first chapter on Chang and Eng's arrival to Wilksboro I laughed out loud. I was hoping for more of the subtle humor, unfortunately it stopped half way through the book. Darin Strauss had a strong start, going from childhood to present day in Wilksboro, but I felt that he rushed things and that the bulk of their life wasn't as interesting to write about as the beginning of their lives. The magic was lost. But it also gave an intriguing look into the lives of Chang and Eng, that being the voyeuristic society we are, kept me turning the pages."
4,Imagine having two heads - literally,"Any reader who seeks out unusual topics of interest should give this a spin. Every time I come across this book somewhere, I smile and get queasy at the same time. I had to take a break here and there - I don't know if this was because it was so weirdly disturbing or if the story sometimes lost its flow. Nonetheless, it's definitely worth the read."
5,No problems so far...,"I needed an inexpensive power distribution bar for an audio/video rack, so I picked this one up. So far, haven't noticed anything bad about it or anything wrong with it.Didn't realize it until after I received it that it's a 10-outlet strip, so that's a plus! Only thing that seems a little bit ""off"" on it is that the cover for the power switch is made of really cheap plastic. I imagine it won't be long before it either breaks or falls off or both, but not a big deal. The power is never shut off to the rack it's installed on, so as long as we leave it alone I can't imagine it giving us any problems.Overall, I'd say give it a shot if you're looking for an inexpensive rackmount PDU."
3,Reliability issue,I've had this laptop over two years and really enjoyed using it. I quickly upgraded to 2G of RAM as Vista chews it up. The speed is now reasonable and I like Vista though it doesn't see eye to eye with some of my older software. Sadly after eighteen months the LCD cable malfunctioned which would have been less of a problem were I living in a country where I could access service. I see others have had this problem so Toshiba need to look at the design. Otherwise a nice machine.
1,"Sweetened by Sugar Alcohol, not just Stevia","When this product finally went from ""out of stock"" to being available, I was very excited but I re-read the reviews ... somebody pointed out it has Maltitol in it ... and just look in the list of ingredients, yes it does. Now I'm not buying this junk. Maltitol is an artificial sweetener, a sugar-based alcohol compound. *WHY* on earth would the makers of a stevia-sweetened line of products use other sweeteners, especially the artificial sweeteners that we're all avoiding by switching to Stevia-based products? It makes no sense. This product needs to go into the trash, and somebody else needs to make an only-stevia-sweetened product line; this SteviaDent is not it. Very disappointed with greedy capitalists that cash in on the Stevia craze with a misleading name instead of offering the product that we want."
3,OK - Does the Job,"I purchased this grinder because the other choices of wet grinders were way too expensive. I mainly use the 10 inch wet wheel to sharpen my woodturning tools. The tool rest is quite cheesy, and Delta does not make a jig to help you sharpen woodturning tools. The wheel itself is quite soft and you will probably have to true it up after every gouge you grind. I agree with one of the other reviews that the drain plug is too small, but its a good grinder for the money."
1,A disappointment from Delta,"I loosing faith in delta slowly but it is happening. this grinder looked and sounded OK for my purposes. But the slow wheel wobbles side to side so much it is not worth the aggravation. I tried Truing it, Shimming it and reversing the wheel. All to no effail. upon Reversing the wheel I noticed that the wheel shaft is machined to small creating the wobble. there is nothing that can be done. I am disappointed in delta For this design"
3,Hodgson Mill Whole Wheat Couscous,I don't particularly like this product. It doesn't cook up the way I think it should and I'm doing it according to package directions.
3,Not worth the price.,"I found this book to be over produced and lack of format. Although there was some interesting reading, I feel this book could have had alot better information in it for the price, plus the way it was written didn't make a whole lotta sense. Yes, there are some excellent pictures, but many of them weren't all that exciting. I do not recommend this book, as it is hardly anything but a collector's item."
4,The series that started it all!,"The Nomad of Time is a very well-written series that follows Capt. Bastable through his amazing adventures. Starting in 1971, Moorcock began what essentially became Steampunk with this series. Exciting adventures, fantastic alternate history, and alternate timelines. It makes for a fun read and it's also an easy read. I give it four stars as the character development does leave a tiny bit to be desired, especially in the third installment.At the end of the day, this should be required reading for all Steampunk fans :)"
5,Great book... easy to follow,"I have been thru this book and used it to learn the basics of Dreamweaver... and I'm so glad I found it! Dreamweaver can be intimidating at first, and this book brought me understanding that only a visual book can do. I highly recommend it (and any of the other ...For Visual Learners books)!!!"
4,Excellent intro to a popular opera.,"For the value, this is an excellent introduction to Gioacchino Rossini's famous opera, ""The Barber of Seville"". Roberto Servile makes a good Figaro; his singing is enjoyable to listen to. The Failoni Chamber Orchestra is excellent and nearly flawless in its performance. At almost 1 hr. and 20 min., the CD includes enough highlights from Rossini's work to satisfy opera lovers -- both neophytes and veterans."
1,Worth about a buck-o-five,"Is it just me, or does Mr. Paisley sound exactly like the country singer in ""Team America: World Police?"" Only asking."
1,Caught off guard and disappointed,"Loved the music but was caught by surprise with the last number ""Cornography"". I hadn't expected ""Pornography"". I thought I had found an artist who respected love, marriage, intimacy, and family relationships. I was wrong. I'll keep looking and listening. This CD went into the garbage because I couldn't find an address (""artist"" or music company) to return it to. Sorry, no longer a fan."
2,"Kucharw,s Gadfly Interpretation","Orchestration and recording does not do justice to this very lovely film score. It sounds tin like, rather dissapointing."
3,Disappointingly Incomplete,"Previous reviews have pointed out that the bulk of this collection focuses (and rightly so) on Mark Knopfler's work with Dire Straits, but the music that is unaddressed creates a vacuum. If one were not familiar with Mark Knopfler, this collection would present a skewed portrait of his range. Where are a couple of tracks from the Neck and Neck album with Chet Atkins? This album showed a great deal of his prowess and playfulness. I would also liked to have seen a track or two from the Notting Hillbillies album. A wonderful opportunity to showcase his range was unexplored. However, as a fan I would find it hard to distill his work down to 2 CD's."
3,Not what I expected,"I wish that i had sampled more of the songs - too much Mark, and not enough Dire"
5,Best of Dire Straits,I'd never heard Dire Straits but enjoy Mark Knofler's guitar playing so decided to try the CD and was very pleased that I had done so.
2,slow and predictable,"It took me a while to finish this because of how boring it was. The characters were fleshed out, but the romance between the two leads was a bit too cheesy at times. I was so tired of reading about ""blue eyes,"" and the phrase ""making love"" was used so much towards the end that I wanted to gag. It's not a good thing that I was more interested in the business aspect of the book than the romance, and I'm not even fond of the subject of business. If you want a light read where you can guess the ending within the first few chapters, then go for it. If not, definitely avoid this book."
5,A great children's album,"This is a great children's album--we love for the kids to have music in both English & Spanish. My family really loves it, its like listening to our Abuelo."
3,Safety Sure PIvot,"Not as happy with it as I had hoped, it did help me turn mom in tight spaces, but it slipped on the vinyl floor and Mom hated it and it scared her. It is well constructed and I think she might have gotten used to it given more time."
3,Not my favorite,"Don't get me wrong, it was ok, but in my opinion not one of her finer works. To me, it lacked the ""what's going to happen next"" factor in her other books that has kept me up late more than once."
4,A great read,"The plot is already well summarized above. I just wanted to add my two cents worth, and that is that this book is a great read."
1,PLEASE HELP ME UNDERSTAND,This is the first book that I just couldn't finish. I couldn't even get into the book. The broken english drove me crazy. How anyone could read this book and overlook the grammar is beyond me. I couldn't even make to the third chapter. I would NEVER BUY A BOOK FROM THIS AUTHOR AGAIN.
2,Another terrible work,The vocals are terrible. The worst vocals i have ever heard. This album and their previous work sucks. Fortunately from the next album and on they transform to another amazing special group.
5,All I Can Say Is WOW!,First I just want to thank everyone who has submitted a review. I would never make this purchase without your comments. I owned these speakers for a month now and I could not have been happier with my purchase.[...]These HK speakers fill my 20X20 room with no problems. They look and sound great with my Onkyo TX-SR606 receiver. Transformers on Blu-Ray was incredible. For me to get better home theater sound I would have to spend a lot more money which means I'll be hanging on to these HK speakers for a very long time.
4,Good quality product,This is money well spent. This is one of the best headset that I have owned to date. The sound quality is super. Best for stereo music. I abused mine and it still works fine. I will buy another one soon. Highly recomended. Super super
4,Blackberry OEM headset,"Pieces of the original headset that came with my Blackberry Curve 8900 broke off and the rubber ear piece was missing so I decided to replace the headset although the one I had was still working. Before I searched Amazon, I went to the Tmobile store to see how much one of those headsets would set me back. Turns out one headset was selling for $20 a pop, and as a broke student I wanted to see how much I could get it from Amazon. I ended up buying the exact same headset like the one that came with my Blackberry from Amazon for only $2.98 (cost of shipping was included in the price). I must say I made out like a bandit and have been happy with the sound quality of the headset. This is the second item I have purchased at a decent price from Amazon. I have been very happy with the quality of both items as well as the expedious shipping."
4,Pretty Good!,"If you're going to read this book, you ought to read all the other ones in the series first; it'll make more sense that way. Anyway, this book was basically about Elizabeth & Jess getting into this huge fight, and they pretty much bite anyone's head off that comes near them. They're friends get really annoyed by their grumpy, upset attitudes and try to get them to makeup...but it doesn't work quite the way they expected"
5,Perfect Size,"I like this cutting board. It's a perfect size to keep readily available without taking over the counter like my larger wood cutting boards do.It also has a little indentation that runs around the edge to catch juice from tomatoes, etc., and keep it from running all over the place.I think I'm going to use this more than all my other cutting boards put together."
5,Great product!,"Love the ""good gribs""! The rubber at each end of the board grabs the counter and sticks. The board doesn't slide on the counter. The board is durable and cleans easily."
2,"Not bad, but Amazon mis-identified the book","I bought this book for my daughter who is auditioning for a performing arts magnet middle school. Unfortunately, Amazon referred to this book as one for middle school students. It is not. The monologues aren't bad, but they are appropriate for kids 15 and up, not for 10-12."
2,Colored when I expected white,"I ordered white. I wanted white cotton underwear in bikini. The description says colors may vary, but I ordered white, not colored, so I really didn't think that the colors would vary in the white panties I ordered. I could have gotten colored bikini underwear at WalMart. Uncool that I had to pay $6 shipping. Now to get my money back I would have to lose $6 shipping. Uncool."
3,It could be better!,I also wonder why someone else has not made a knock off at a better price. I have had this machne for 3 years and am on my second stone. I buy and sell antique tools as well as make custom furniture. I have used it to sharpen every thing but my internal gouges. I do not like the dimond dressing attachment. I machined a new jig that would hold the $20 dimond dressing wheel by Delta. It makes for a very flat stone in less time. I have also made jigs that are stiffer that do not flex. I love the fact that I spend so much less time sharpening my tools etc. I sharpened my 13 planer blades. I had to make a longer guide so I could slide the blade all the way accross. Time is money and even at the price they charge I have made my money back many times over with the time saved. Having a small machine shop on the side has made the machine more usable for my needs. This is a wood carvers dream come true. Happy Sharpening
2,Crazy Price,"This is a simple electric motor, a low speed grinding wheel and a water bath. It costs $390! Sure it works well. If you are a rich nut I suppose it is THE machine. Otherwise, this is just crazy. Why someone hasn't built a similar tool for $120 is a big question I have. There is nothing in the engineering of this simple tool or its jigs which justifies the very high costs."
4,Robin Hood music,"The intent of this recording (according to the liner notes) is to evoke some of the sounds sentiments and personalities of Robin Hood's time, then drawing on later ballads and dances to celebrate the enduring Robin Hood legend. In this regard, the CD does a good job, presenting a variety of works from the late 1100s through the 17th Century. I'll agree with another reviewer that the ensemble playing is not the best, and sounds unpolished in several songs. The soprano is quite good, though. And there are a number of good little dances. Ballads like Robin Hood & the Curtall Fryer, Robin Hood & Maid Marian, and The Wedding of Robin Hood are all classic humorous Robin tales. Unfortunately, enjoyment of them may suffer from the lack of a lyrics sheet. Overall, if you like Robin Hood stories and early music, this is a fairly fun and inexpensive CD to add to your collection."
2,"AMAZON.COM TERRIBLE, NEVER RECEIVED PRODUCT",I can not really say how this product is as I never received it. This has happened in the past dealing with Amazon.com. To get FREE SHIPPING I combined it with another product to get the free shipping. One was not available so the whole order was held until the other item was to be available. That projected ship date was over FIVE (5) WEEKS AWAY. This was the second time this had happened to me. I have since cancelled my account and will NEVER DEAL WITH AMAZON.COM AGAIN.
1,Failed to work,"This product worked one time and then wouldn't reset to work again. I tried moving it to another plug-in, further away from garage door opener. Again, it would work once and then stop working. I returned it."
1,Instapark Dual Garage Door Laseer,This item did not work for my 2 car garage application. I mounted the unit about even with the hood of the car. When I pulled the car in it didn't detect the montion. I have 9' ceilings. i then mounted it about even with the front door of the car. The unit now comes on but by the time you have reached the area you are parking the lasers have gone out. Being that there is no way to adjust the time on the lasers or the sensitivity of the motion I would not reccomment this unit.
1,waste of time! don't you do it!,Please do NOT waste your time ordering this POS.There is not enough adjustment for the lasers to cover a double car install.THE POWER SUPPLY WAS DOA!I'de give it zero stars if I could
1,Instapark Dual Garage Door Laser Parking Guide System,This item is pretty poor workmanship and doesn't really work very well. Would probably be OK if you just wanted to use it with one car but with two it's very hard to line up. The lasers quit after about 4 days and I returned product for refund. I guess the best thing to use is a tennis ball and a piece of string!!
3,Instapark Dual Garage Parking Guide System,"The installation was pretty straight forward. The motion sensor works fine and the laser spot is quite visible. It would helpful for it to stay on a little longer after the motion sensor turns it own as I have a truck, so I'm entering the garage carefully and slowly and it will turn off before I am parked. Also, the power cord could stand to be a little longer, say 18"" and the lateral range of motion of the laser pointers could stand to be a little wider."
5,MEDEA,Maria Callas she is the Queen of Art God send Her For us Pasolini He is the king of Art They Crown Each other by Medea Callas she give us Art more than aney wamen DiD in the History of Art and pasolini by Medea he give us a film can live in the kingdom Of Art forever[...]
2,Of minimal interest,"It's hard to know who exactly would enjoy this violence-ridden, very sick reenactment of what some of ancient history surely was. The script seems to have been about ten pages long, and the rest is scenery and people marching and screaming. Looooong shots of Maria Callas and freaky music apparently thrill many. A terrible bore."
4,A must-see for Callas and Pasolini fans,"Callas is great as Medea; that was one of her most riveting roles on the opera stage. Here one can sense what a unique artist she was, as she is incredible in this dramatic role. Other than Callas's participation, it's a beautiful piece of cinema, it's shot similarly to Oedipus Rex by Pasolini, so you wil enjoy it if you like Rex. Writing this review, I am thinking again of why films like that are not made anymore...It is for a serious movie buff, so give it a miss if you like Hollywood mass production."
3,iLuv i904 Headphones Noise Canceling,"The headset reproduce highs, lows and midtone frequencies very well. Noise cancelation is OK within a home environment. I use for home theater, MP3 player or just to reduce background noise when I using my notebook in the basement."
5,A fantastic read,Once again Ms.Berg has written a down-to-earth book with outstanding plot and characters. A great read for people of all ages. Can't wait for her next one........
5,Geri's positivity comes through on her ambitious new album.,"I didn't know I'd be in for such a pleasant surprise. All the tracks on this album are chalk full of ambition, including Look at Me and Mi Chico Latino. The biggest surprise are her warm vocals on Lift Me Up and Walkaway. Geri has definitely proved herself as a solo artist."
4,"Good job, Geri !!","The music and the lyrics are really good, especially look at me, lift me up, walkaway and sometime. It's a pity though that geri's vocal doesn't sound right sometimes. Either way, I still think geri's done a good job. For me (and probably to a lot of other people), the song walkaway has to be the best, it's beautiful.---ANNA"
5,I think her CD is EXCELENT!!!!!,I listened to all the songs and I think that Geri Halliwell is great without the spice girls!!!I always liked her and her voice!!!
2,Her voice is awful,"In my opinion Geri's voice is awful, I just can't stand it. It's much too weak and so embarassingly awful sounding. I also dislike her ""WANNA BE"" sex symbol attitude. I mean someone who is really sexy doesn't need to press it so much. I still gave her 2 points b'cuz I like the lyrics of ""Lift me up""."
5,Geri is a DIVA!,"I think that ""Shizophonic"" is the best CD I have listened to, to date. My favorite track on the CD is ""Mi Chico Latino"", and ""Look At Me"". If you buy the CD for the first time, make sure that u listen to ""Look At Me"" first. It gives a good idea and understanding of what the CD is gonna be, and what to be prepared for. I also like ""Walkaway"". If you listen to this, and read the lyrics while u r singing along to it, it sounds like Geri has dedicated or tributed this song to what's left of the Spice Girls. Kind of like what the Spice Girls did with ""Goodbye"". All and all this CD is definitely schizophonc(split sounds) Hope that everyone enjoys this CD!"
5,Awsome,Look At Me was Quite the song to come out with. MiChico Latino went straight to the top of the charts and same with Lift Me Up. Who knows how else her songs witll do but I can't wait till her next C.D.
5,"Wonderful,Geri is really back!",I like this CD very much.Geri has a wonderful voice.I think Lift me up is the best song.I wish for Geri that very much people will buy this CD. She is really fantastic!
4,Mature kicky album - for all us older Spice Girls!,"Wonderfully magnificent. I love the messages contained in the lyrics. Geri still exudes girl power and feminity, but in a way that reaches young women above girls. Excellent, I love it. ""Walkaway"" and ""Bag It Up"" are wonderful, enchanting pieces!"
5,Geri is Spicier than ever!,"I have been on the edge of my seat since Ms. Halliwell left the Spice Girls. Let's just say that now I'm up and dancing! I have nothing bad to say about Geri's first solo album (except the production on ""You're in a Bubble"" is a little sparse for such fab lyrics). I can't wait until Geri tours the States!"
2,great book yeah right,This book was realy bad in the first part.then it gota little bit better but then it just got boring.all in all this book fluped
2,Not Age Appropriate,"After my daughter experienced a few nightmares, I read this book myself to see what all the fuss was about. Within the book a miner 'blows his brains out' and among other things a crude amputation is performed 'in detail' after which the child is left by his relatives to die in their mad rush for wealth.This is not my idea of an appropriate book for an 11 year old. To me there is no glory, only an immense waste of human life in this book. It is depressing and moreover I was angered that the public school system chose to present it as part of the ciriculum without some sort of warning to parents and students about violent content.I'm not sure what everyone believes appropriate anymore, however if you made a movie with the same detail as this book I can guarantee that the rating would be R and no child would be watching it."
2,prety bad,The book starts out very badly. It is very hard to understand what is happening.once it gets into the action it gets a little better. As you go on it gets better and better. The end is really really bad. It didnt really relate to the rest of the storykenny101p.s. dont listen to ashrey pinkes
4,"Not newberry material, but a good read","The begining is just OK because it is slowly paced, but speeds up after the first ten chapters. the middle is GREAT because of the page turning action and plot twists, and the end is full of happiness and rejoice.Happy Hollidays and a have a happy new year,Ashrei Pinkus"
2,Better off with the newer model,"This drive is good for 2 months or so. Then the rubber glue that holds the case gets worn out and the case pops open. I sent mine to sandisk at least 4 times. Good thing they pay for the shipping to and from your house. Sandisk has good customer support, but they take a long time to go through the process.The newer model has a cheaper case, but it does not come apart."
3,Good Device but Amazon Sold me a counterfeit,"In General the Device is SOLID. Held up to wear and tear of being in my pocket for a year and a half. Recently, 256MB out of the 512mb of space Disappeared so I contacted SanDisk. They reported to me that it was a Counterfeit Device as it didn't have Sandisk's Vendor ID embedded in the ""Device instance ID"" in Windows Device manager. Mine was sold BY amazon, not a 3rd party and I contacted Amazon immediately. They promptly said they would replace it and it is supposed to take about 5-8 days to arrive so we'll see how that goes. These Units have a 5 year warranty from sandisk so call their support first if anything goes wrong. (I called on a sunday night a 7pm and talked to a live person) Sandisk has good knowledgable support."
1,Avoid this Product,"I agree with Ordonez below: this product will stop working for no apparent reason. I believed the hype and went ahead and purchased it. After a few week it was like ..wham.. no longer working. The computers do not even recognize the product, the blue light doesnt come on..nothing. I contacted sandisk for a replacement and they have not replied since. It just doesn't make any sense. This is how bad rep starts with a company product; word of mouth from disgruntled customers. However I will try to contact them again"
1,Another failed drive,No reason to add much here ... the other reviewers telling you about this drive and its almost guaranteed failure have said it all. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. Period.
1,Not reliable at all,"I bought and own 10 of these things.5 of them are already death after less than 6 months of use. They were working properly and then for no apparent reason stopped working. Fortunately I had most of my date backed up, but I still lost some valuable info.The company has changed 2 already and I Hope they replace the remaining 3. Dealing with them takes a looong time.I also bought two 2 GB flashdrives last xmas...they died last week and of course, I'll try to get a refund or a replacement from sandiskI guess this is the reason why they have become cheaper, they are just a pile of trash into a nice titanium case.So, avoid these things by all meansEdgar"
2,"Purchased four, have broken three.","The whole idea of this design is ingenious. The sad part is the drive is not as tough as SanDisk markets it. If you buy one of these...be sure to have your data backed-up. I've broken three. The funny thing is I have four all plastic drives that just keep holding up. SanDisk refused to replace the last one saying I broke it. Understandable. It would have appeared that I could have broken it. It looks as if I had snapped it of in the computer. However, If that had been the case, the 4 copper conductor would have been bent at that point. Fact of the matter is the drive just came apart, just as the other have. I won't buy another SanDisk product for the simple reason that their Tech Support has you jumping through hoops way before they decide whether or not they are going to replace their defective drive. I can get less aggravated for less money just about anyplace. It's a cool drive. If you decide to buy, just back up your data. It will break."
4,excellent,"Pete Brown had written words for Cream. He formed his own band, Battered Ornaments, using English jazzmen of the late 1960s. A lot of these guys had worked with Bruce in jazz circles before Cream, worked with him on hisSongs for a Tailor, and worked in the group Collusium.This is pretty song oriented jazz rock with good soling and good writing. The songs are keyboard based and the drumming is excellent.The album sounds a little flat and thin at times, but this may just be the transfer to CD.Good progressive rock that is not well known but would be a good pick for anyone who wants to go beyond the obvious in the genre."
5,PORK...THE OTHER WHITE MEAT!!!,"This is an incredible album of trip-hop, acid jazz, funk and ambient cuts by one of the best duos in chill-out! All ""weird"" song titles aside, Fila Brazillia delivers the dam to the river--chilling you out one minute and making you drop it like it's hot the next! Another amazing accomplishment from the true ""kings of chill-out""!"
5,A Great DVD,"This is an excellent product and received swiftly and in perfect condition. My son who loves dinosaurs and the Spinosaurus dinosaur specifically, which features in this DVD, was extremely pleased to receive this as a birthday present and has been watching this DVD a lot since he received it - a great purchase!"
4,My Kids watch this over and over!,"We love Dinosaur Train in our house. My kids, who are 4 and 6 years old, really enjoy watching this DVD; if I let them they'd watch it all day! (Of course I don't.)I do wish that they included the Dr Scott segments on the DVD's, because the comparisons to modern animals are very interesting. Other than that a great DVD. Dinosaurs *and* trains, what's not to love?"
1,"This isn't for everyone, and it wasn't for me","I thought that this would be right up my alley because I'm a fan of the super-weird. My hopes were that the film would be corny and darkly funny, like a cross between ""Hogan's Heroes"" and a sexy cheesy women's prison flick. However, it made me very uncomfortable, mostly because it deals with something that was in fact very real - torture in the concentration camps of the Nazis - and in a very gory and graphic way. I actually had a nightmare after watching it. I'm no prude, and I don't condemn anyone who does like this film. But ask yourself if you can find humor or enjoyment in the Holocaust and torture...if the answer is yes, then perhaps you'll like this movie. If the answer is no, save your money."
1,The worst movie I ever saw,"Well, that was the worst movie I saw in my life... It was not interesting, entertaining, hot, sexy, etc. - it was just ugly... I expected it to be unconventional and funky but at least I expected it to have some taste - it was the most tasteless work I ever saw... Do not by it - it is complete waste of time and money."
1,My biggest porn mistake,"Something important happened in this film: the depictions of Nazi sadism are realistic; the use of prisoners for usually fatal experiments is credible and actually happened; the starvation and horror shows in every scene. A clear picture of evil at its worst. Then there's nudity, rape, slow torture and death. Perhaps the film is useful to get some idea of the horror of the Holocaust. Anti-semites will find a thrill here. But there is nothing in the least bit erotic or even less than horrifying in this film. I saw this fifteen years ago, and the images can still unsettle me. View if you must, but if this excites you, consider therapy."
3,this movie wasnt bad but it wasnt what i was expectin,i mean i thought it was suppose to be more of a comedy but it wasnt at all it was more of a drama. it had some funny parts but it is not at all a comedy. guess it is a solid debut from benny boom. i've seen much worst than this.
5,great transaction,"Product was as described, packaged well and shipped quickly. Also it is a great movie. I will be watching it over and over again as it is very funny."
2,NEXT DAY AIR DVD,"Too many F words, and very little plot. Nothing you don't see in the local slums as life in the big city. I would rate this movie a 3 as 10 being best. I put mine in the trash can. Too bad the description of story is rated a low class liberial. Not a family movie.. If this is what America is coming too' Get your mind out of the gutter"" Check the reviews of a movie by Christians who tell it as it is."
5,Great video!,I happened to be VERY close to the guy that made this video....very nice guy and he did a great job....its a LOT of fun and if you ever get a chance to meet him....you will really appreciate it more.
5,Realistic!,"Susan Weekley's recent book, ""Hens Rule"", is billed as a romantic mystery. The romance is realistic and believeable. The mystery draws the reader into a suspensful tale of intrigue and murder. The characters are easily identifiable and soon become as familiar as old friends. An exciting story, well written and thoroughly enjoyable."
1,"WORD OF WARNING - MISLABELED, NOT SEASON 4","THESE EPISODES ARE NOT SEASON 4 AS DESCRIBED, THEY ARE FROM SEASON 3. Also video quality was horrible, the color levels were way off - not viewable."
1,Too Vertical,"The photo for this product is very misleading as the cookbook holder appears to be tilting backward on a nice angle. Unfortunately, the holder is completely vertical and therefore it is extremely awkward to read a recipe."
1,STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED ITEM,Item appears to have vanished in the us postal system. I need help on getting it sent to me please...
1,Is there a section on surgical mistakes?,"I went to Tebbetts some years ago mislead by his website that he was 'the best' choice for augmentation surgery. One of the anatomical implants was placed upside down--Oops! I had to go to another surgeon for corrective surgery and wasted $7,000 (not to mention pain and suffering) with the Tebbetts. I have been very pleased with my smooth, round implants. The surgeon I went to for the correction was recommended to me by another woman unhappy with results through John Tebbetts office. I do not trust the man nor would I trust any of his advice."
3,Leaves my hair a little sticky,"I like the concept behind Aveda, but I'm not sure their products work for me. I'm not a big product user, but I thought mousse should be in my hair care arsenal, the price seems good, and I like the ingredient list. However, it leaves my hair kind of dull-looking and sticky, and doesn't add much volume. I realize this could have a lot to do with me not buying the texturing and finishing products and not having the same styling equipment that they used on me in the salon (or maybe I just don't have that magic touch), but I don't have the money or time or patience to go through so many steps in the morning. I want soft, clean-feeling hair more than I care about volume or style, and this mousse isn't doing it for me. So I'm giving 3 stars for an okay product that doesn't add much to my 'do', and I think I'll look elsewhere when I run out."
3,Wireless is Fun...Sound is not!,"I was highly anticipating these wireless headphones, and expecting too much. The wireless and bluetooth portion of these headphones are truly great and convienant; however, the sound on these babies are mediocre. There is hardly any bass and it sounds much better with the noise cancellation function on. I wish it could have been an all around wireless headphone, but I guess you can't have everything you want sometimes....If you want sound quality, then try Bose if you have the dough. Those have spectacular and incredible sound, but at the same time, expensive!"
3,3 star product,"Build quality could use some improvement. I had this for around nine months before it just stopped charging. No lights, no indication of anything that went wrong and there's no screws so the unit definitely isn't user serviceable. Sound quality was pretty good, noise canceling was so-so, price compared to other Bluetooth headphones was pretty good so overall 3-stars."
3,Something Good,"I purchased this just for a few songs which I enjoyed listening too. But Alas! What a surprise. All the songs were enjoyable. It had stuff I've never heard. Really great. Buy Buy Buy..I know I'll enjoy this CD for the rest of my life. Try it, you'll like it!"
2,Didn't like it at all,"Aint She Sweet is the remake of all SEP's previous stories, it's the same plot: a woman with problems, a dark brooding man, she finds a fortune, he talks like a woman and they live happily ever after.First of all a character like Sugar Beth cannot turn around like this. If she was a jerk in highschool, to a point of being evil and vindictive, she will always stay like that, and she will most definatelly NOT turn into a nice person. I understand that romance novels are supposed to be fairy tales, but come now, this is rediculous. There is the same cheesy humor on ever page that is annoying as hell. Why can't they talk normally, why do they have to talk like they give a performance? That makes the characters so superficial and pretentious that i couldn't help but dislike most of them.Clearly, SEP needs to come up with new ideas, all of her books are the same. Her best book, IMO, is Nobody's Baby but Mine. That was hillarious and smart. This book is not."
2,A good imitator but that's all....,"Imitating Elvis' voice is one thing, saying that Ral Donneris like Elvis or deserves even more attention is justhilarious and offensive. One reviewer even calls himself an Elvis fanand then states that ""long before Elvis there was Ral Donner"" .Let's put things straight! He sounds like Elvisand imitates his voice pretty well in the movie ""This is Elvis""but that's all. The singing capacity of the King has widelybeen accepted as the ""best voice ever"" able to sing allexisting American music styles: Rock 'n Roll, Country, Blues,Gospel, Spiritual, Folk whatever you want to call it.On the Ral Donner's CD some songs are acceptable but the restis quite ""forgettable"" like the songs of any other rockabilly artist fromthe late 50's that never made it on the top 100.There are more Elvis' imitators with solid music carreersbesides imitating him like Ronnie McDowell with almost 40 hitson the C&W; Billboard hitlist.Please some more respect for Elvis Presley!"
4,serves it's purpose well,"It bugs me that the two halves are glued a little off center, but it works well and doesn't drip down the side."
3,Just okay...,"The back is fabulous, but on the front there is no accommodation made for the slight height difference for the screen and the buttons. So it is impossible to get the shield secured without any bubbles. That is kind of annoying! Otherwise, it is good."
1,Hair gel for cats.,"My cats were fine with my husband and I using these wipes on them, but it left their fur incredibly sticky! After five minutes, it hardened their fur into spikes; it was as if we'd put hair gel into our cats' fur and finished it off with a thick coat of hair spray! Brushing it out did no good, and we had to give them a bath in the end to get the gunk out of their fur. I would never recommend this to anyone, unless their cats are backup dancers at a punk rock concert."
2,Falls short of instructive illustrations and guidance,I was nonplussed by this book. I unfortunately listened to the previous reviewer (Ian) from 2002 and purchased this book.Real World Photoshop is a large text but fails to provide even minimum pictorial guides and step by step instructions. The lengthy text does not stay on target and show how to actually resolve the issues or photographic problem being discussed. There are far better Photoshop books available that teach you needed skills. This one doesn't do the job.
3,FLAWED but decent,"Very good overall but but has some mistakes in it. Also has some gotchas. For instance the first web application project you create also silently creates a ""soloution"". VS documentation recommends you explicitly create a solution first then any projects. Advice = DON'T try examples on production server."
5,Great book to understand Visual Studio.Net,"I was intimidated by the .Net Visual Studio IDE, but this book really helped me to understand how to use it. I tried most of the sample code and did not have problems with it. It is a very pratical book. I'm reading it a second time since last year to more fully understand this complex topic. Good job."
2,"The difference between knowing, and being able to teach ...","This might be the book for you, if:- you need a crash course in VS.Net,- you're pretty well-versed in Visual Basic 6.0- you're pretty good at filtering out irrelevant praise for the product- you are willing to skim through examples, getting the jist of things without actually trying to make them work- you can't find a more carefully-written crash-course book covering the same groundThen again, if you're that good to begin with, you can probably learn VS.Net without a crash-course book."
3,"Works, but doesn't stick as well as others","I love the plastic placemats from Chick fil a and thought this would be the same. The adhesive is not as strong and even though the adhesive is on all four sides, my 9 month old son can and does pull it up when he gets bored. It does however keep his food off dirty restaurant tables."
3,"Cute & contain mess, but not biodegradeable","These were the first table-toppers I purchased and I loved that they helped contain messes and also kept my little one from eating food off of a table. But, I soon encountered a better solutions... there are other table toppers that are biodegradeable (the Pooh ones are plastic). The other brand also is mostly black and white, and my my older kiddo enjoys coloring on them. Overall these type of products are great for early self feeders, but I prefer the ones that will biodegrade."
3,"Cute, roomy, but smelly",When I picked up the box from the UPS store it smelled really bad. The best way I can describe it is moth balls that you would put in a closet. I put it in my trunk and could smell it inside my car. When I took it in and we assembled it the whole house smelled after leaving it in the living room overnight. I'm don't know if it is the stain or what but it still smells. It is currently outside on the porch. I'm hoping it will air out over time because the cats don't even want to go in it. I'm guessing they don't like the smell either.The house is cute and a good size but not being used and I am a little disappointed. I'd honestly like to return it.
1,not worth the buy,"i bought this because i already have the other two unstable fables; ""Tortoise VS. Hare"" and ""Threee Little Pigs and A Baby"". i enjoyed these two and have watch them many times. But this Goldilocks is just boring and stupid and not funny and not interesting and not what the others were. i wouldn't recommend this to anyone to purchase."
1,this book stinks!,this book is impossiable to read it has horriable reading words and its to hard for anyone under the age of 20 to read so i would rcommend that you never read this book cause it really does stink so dont waste a penny on buying this book because it really and truely sucks. it has no meaning once so ever and take my word on it dont even think about reading this book cause all youll be doing is wasting your own time when you could be reading a good book! Thanks!
4,I give this 4 stars unheard,"Chip Taylor's Last Chance was one of my favorite non-mainstream CW albums of the '70s. Of course, everybody knows Taylor wrote Wild Thing(which was covered both by The Troggs and also by a Bobby Kennedy impersonator) and Angel of The Morning, which moved Seattle's Merilee Rush out of Parker's and The Spanish Castle and onto the Top-40 charts, but he's less well known for being the brother of actor Jon Voight(Catch-22 & Deliverance). Taylor's a gifted songwriter, and I'm ordering this collection to go with my scratchy old LPs. Unfortunately, 101 In Cashbox isn't on this disc, which is about Taylor's experiences when Angel became a hit, and why I only gave 3 stars. Any Way You Want Me was covered by Bread, before David Gates joined the group, and consigned them to the limbo of elevators and easy listening stations. Joe Bob says check it out."
4,Forget the whiners this album rules!,"I think this is one of DT's best albums they have put out but you simply cannnot compare or expect this album to be another early 90's images and words album thats been done with. These guys will not go back to making another images and words album weather the fans like it or not because they changed for the better.Ok now for my review this album was not really as bad as the whiners say it is, It has 6 songs but very long songs and I guess my only complaint is the lack of vocals in every song (if thats correct) but the music was top notch with neoclassical style guitars from john petrucci and wizard style key boards from jordan rudess makes this album worthy for every true DT fan.Overall I rate it 4 stars!"
4,a great DT album,"Sysremaric chaos is one the best albums from DT along with Octavarium,sixdegress of inner Turbulence and DT live ar Budokan.All these songs rock hard but there melodies in all songs with superb guitar riffs.Highly recommebded."
4,Much Better!!!,"So much better than Octavarium that I can't express it. ......Have you ever heard Into The Arena , an instrumental by the Michael Schenker Group that is really good. Well , if you haven't , listen to track 7 here. It is a really great song that someone decided to stick a direct rip-off of Into The Arena right in the middle of. Some of the guitar parts are practically note for note. And -it just doesn't fit. what a way to ruin a very good original song. And yes , we all know how much you guys respect Metallica. But , those vocals didn't fit either. Despite these weird parts, this is one of their best ever and these guys live are always phenomenal. Try the new Symphony X if you like the heavier side of progressive ..it is killer."
2,dissapointed,"Being a long time fan, and after not really liking Octavarium very much, I wasn't sure what to expect. After the first couple of minutes I thought this album would be reaaly cool. After that they lost me. The songs just didn't grab me. Don't get me wrong, there is nobody better when it comes to musicianship, but the songs just aren't that good. Here and there I would here something really cool and after a couple of bars it was gone, never to be heard again. Hope I like the next offering. I used to just buy Dream Theater albums because I knew they would be great. After the last two I will be listening to the samples first."
1,"10% Good, 90% Bad","Let me say first that I have been a huge fan starting with Day and Dream Unite all the way through Octavarium loyally. And I am not going to do a song by song analysis of this album. Also, this is not a knee jerk reaction but an opinion based on many listens. I simply want to say that I feel this project is just uninteresting from the start. Most of Portnoys parts sound like a higher priority was given to something else. Myong is steady as usual and of course the overall musicianship is there but as a band it just wasn't happening for me. Also, I don't need to hear Dream Theater doing Metallica based melodies or their attepmt at Death Metal. They just need to be Dream Theater. The whole band mailed this one in and I hope to hear a better effort on the next one."
5,Terrific Book,"I really loved SANDWICHED. It was funny, sweet, sad, poignant, charming, and filled with wry and witty observations about life, love, and the pursuit of happiness. All three women came across as real, although CiCi tried my patience more than once. I kept wanting her to buck up and move on with her life the way her mother and daughter were doing. She redeems herself in the end, though. Archer's writing is very good and you can see the promise in it. I predict she'll be a big star one day. You read it here first. :) HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
2,LOTS of typos and errors in this book,"This book was obviously scanned from another document and NEVER proofread at all. While the content was interesting, I found the poor quality and misspellings due to the scanning process very distracting. Whoever decided to copy and release this book should have taken the time to make the necessary corrections."
5,comfort+,These sox are very comfortable and wear extremely well. Plus they do wick away moisture. Good choice for summertime wear.
5,Much more than another art book.,"This book can be savored not only for the magnificent reproductions of a vast array of maritime art, but also for what can be learned about what was in the mind of the artists at the time the paintings were set to canvas. For those who have an interest in shipping, the seashore or maritime history, there is a wealth of information and historical perspective provided by each artist. There's even a glossary of art and maritime terminology. This book will provide hours of relaxation and contemplation of places and times we formerly could only imagine."
1,Can't have what you want.,"I just wanted to buy nine of Peter's hit songs. That's all I wanted. You know, nine hit songs in their original hit version. I studied all 17 CD's and made charts to see which CD had all my wanted hits. Well, one CD had it all...The Glory of Love CD..., but looking more carefully, they were all live versions, and not the original hit versions. Other CDs each had a few hits, still others had new versions, and still others had duets.There was not one CD out of the 17 that had all my nine hits in their original version....so I got angry and bought....NOTHING."
1,Scam Alert!,"I agree with everyone else. Bought this disc to play at a wedding (yes, I'm a DJ) and what a waste. If it's a LIVE recording, please say so!!!"
1,Unhappy With Order.,The product does not work even after new batteries. Contacted the company and no return label was offered. Postage to return greater than original purchase with postage. Not a reliable buy.
3,It does the job,"Well, the clip that the strap connects to broke right out of the package. CHEAP! I needed one for my bug out pack, so that's where it sits."
4,Neat little monocular,"It is a nice little monocular. It is a bit shaky when trying to use at closer distances, but it seems well made. I would recommend this as a first or budget monocular. Camo is a nice touch."
3,quality issue,"Poor quality product, but very good vendor (Grady on-line). It's very easy to get refund from that vendor if you don't like the product (same refund policy as with Amazon)"
4,Star Wars + Age of Empires = A Damn good time,"While not new or groundbreaking, this game is a lot of fun. Especially if you're like me and are a diehard Star Wars fan and you've enjoyed playing Age of Empires. The graphics were pretty good for it's time and the sound is the usual incredible Star Wars experience, gone are the days of X-Wing's terrible voice acting. Each of the sides are similar, but have some of their own unique units. At a time when Star Wars games were don the decline in quality this was a breath of fresh air. It also will run pretty well on a low end machine, in todays times that's hard to come by. It's definitly worth the $9.99 price of admission."
1,notice the review ratings are padded by the author?,"I am always extremely suspicious of any book where the author does a review of his own book and gives himself 5 stars in an attempt to influence buying behavior. Also note that there is another ""name"" that repeatedly assigns this book 5 stars 3 different times. Kinda makes you wonder about the book deosnt it?After looking at this book I recommend you should review this book yourself carefully before making a buy decision and not rely on the positive ""reviews"" you see here."
5,abundatrade,abundatrade sent me my wonderful Scriabin CD as early as possible and I love it ! it plays well and Scriabin is underrated5 stars for abundatrade!
3,tom swift,i first fell in love with the Tom Swift series as a youth. I purchased this for my grandson hopeing he will like the series as well as i did
2,Good looks - Bad Effects,"The women in this DVD are great looking, but the real reason for my purchase was the 3D effect and it wasn't true 3D. If you are looking into purchasing it for the looks alone, you might like it, otherwise, I say don't waste your money."
4,Girls in 3-D.. needs nudity!,Girls - to do the dishes Girls - to clean up my room Girls - to do the laundry Girls - and in the bathroom
1,I also think this is Undergraduate thesis...,"It's really hard to understand why this has got a series of 5 star rating...I feel really sorry to say that ""this is really disappointing book"" because I had been looking forward to read it.But this only provides poor analysis, poor theoretical ground, and poor argument.Yes, there are surely lots of things to say about Barbie, but I think you can chose another books."
4,Woolf's sharp pricture of England from 1880 to 1920,"Spanning perhaps the most important fourty years of English history, Woolf's novel weaves together a fragmented view of life in England from 1880 to roughly 1920. Touching on some common themes from her more well known work, ""The Years"" focuses on humans attempting to recover part of the past, and build toward an always uncertain future. Woolf's stories of personal interaction in a world becoming increasingly modern still honesty today for a world that could still use more."
2,More Kottke than Gordon,"What do you get when a legendary jam band bassist gets together with a legendary acoustic guitar virtuoso, and they go to Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas with a percussionist and record an album?You guessed it...""66 Steps"".I bought this after hearing the duo's cover of Aerosmith's ""Sweet Emotion"". That song, along with maybe a couple of others, are the highlights of the record to this listener.If you're a Kottke fan, you'll probably like it more than I did. If you expected a jammier record, chances are you'll be a little disappointed."
4,A Solid Disc... With No Copy Protection Problems!,"The Musical Reviews Here Are More Than Sufficient, GREAT Album... But More Importantly... The Copy Protection scheme on this album is EXCELLENT for the end user. Features are Built In Player MAC AND WINDOWS) And the ability to e-mail a song to friends BUILT IN. It allows rips to itunes and ipod.... IT IS SIMPLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT YOU FROM MAKING PERFECT DIGITAL REPLICAS OF THE DISC!....Know Your Technology BEFORE writing a ""review"".-JOSH"
2,Just a thought!,"I have tried both cd's, Clone and this one. I have a hard time adjusting to blended performances with Kottke. With all due respect, Kottke needs no accompaniment! His performance alone is what makes one appreciate this true virtuoso. Listen to Kottke alone, solo. Still holding in high esteem and respect for both artists I must admit this cd is confusing, and was disappointing. I have followed Leo and his solo performances over 1/2 of the US, and still am messmerized at each performance, I will listen a few more times to this release, reluctantly just in case I failed to get it. But at this time, ""I still don't get it!"""
1,Sunncomm,"I purchased this cd without knowing about the sunncomm deal. I unfortuantly found all about this after attempting to rip the tracks for my car mp3 disk. I will be taking a closer look at my cd backs from now on to avoid buying any further cds with this junk on it. Easy enough to get around, but on principle. I hate giving this cd 1 star as I love kottke and its good music, but I have to do it, due to sonys distrubition. It's a shame."
4,Another Great Collaboration!,"This album is another great collaboration. It is very different from Clone--it really has its' own feel. Part of that feel being the Bahamas--it's just different.And about the copy protect--just burn it to a cd, rip the WAV files from the burnt cd back onto your computer, and then convert them to MP3's or whatever. Annoying--yes. Copy-proof--no.Thanks Mike & Leo!!!"
5,Like to buy this way,I like being able to buy in quantity at a good price so I don't have to continue to look for them every couple of weeks.
3,Expecting a little more,"I have been a fan of Bettie Page for a few years now and collect whatever I can find here and there. I have also read and research her life on the web and some published articles, so I was excited about the DVD thinking that it would have a bit more information into her life, but it is simply a review of everything that has already been published about this very intriguing female. Overall it is fun to watch and well made."
2,"Wasn't bad,wasn't great.","Not a bad story,though as one reviewer said without any sense of awe or adrenaline that you would find in an older Conan novel.Harry,your time would have been better spent writing another Gerrin the Fox novel than a novel about a pre teen Conan with anger management problems and a crush on the girl next door.Is this how we really want to picture Conan's childhood?"
4,Just Plain Raw,"I have to admit Banks did his thang on Block Party. When I first read the back I was like this look too corny. Some old man tryin to sell drugs after sellin em in the first place, he must be real dumb!! But after about page 10 I was hooked. This book is too raw. Dont let the description fool you. It sound corny but trust me it aint."
4,Essence of Mind and Pattern,"At any level of scientific comprehension, this book provides an intelligent subscription to pattern. Includes essays and 'conversations' on Alan Turing, and clear and relevant description of common and interesting science. The most valuable information is hofstaedter's creative description of thought."
5,When Martin Gardner needed a replacement . . .,"In the days before Scientific American changed its focus, Martin Gardner wrote the long running ""Mathematical Games"" column. When he decided to move on to other projects, Douglas Hofstadter was asked to carry on in his place.Hofstadter was up to the task and in an homage to his predecessor and in keeping with his unique vision, he promptly changed the title of the column from ""Mathematical Games"" to the anagram of ""Mathematical Games"": Metamagical Themas.For the short time the column ran, it was my personal favorite.Minds with the grasp of language, music, mathematics and humor are rare things. Hofstadter's work here is as crystalline in its beauty as it is fiendish in its play."
5,Cushion for my throne!,I am very pleased with the cushion. Could be a bit softer but it does the job better than stacked beach towels. The handles are really helpful in moving from the car to the wheelchair.
5,Works well,Works as advertised. Gives enough support to enable my husband to get up from the car with out assistance.
5,Nice and firm,"I bought this cushion to provide me with a bit of extra seat height when away from my home as I have difficulty getting up from low seats. It's plenty firm to give you most of the thickness as additional seating height, which was the main thing I worried about prior to its' arrival. The carry handles are handy, too. It lives in my car."
4,Capitol Collectors Series: The Four Preps,"It's a good CD. I liked almost all of the songs. This is the first time I have heard many of them. They did great impersonations on More Money For You And Me, and The Big Draft medleys."
4,BASEBALL SMACK T-SHIRT,"THIS SHIRT IS PERFECT FOR THE GREATEST RIVALRY IN SPORTS!AMAZON SHOULD OFFER MORE ITEMS LIKE THIS. BOSTON & NY FANS LOVE TO GO BACK & FORTH AGAINST EACH OTHER & THIS SHIRT JUST FUELS THE FIRE! I GOT ONE FOR ME & ONE FOR MY SON, WHO HAS TO DEAL W/ RED SOX FANS UP AT HIS UNIVERSITY. GO YANKEES!"
2,Updated Edition as Boring as the First Edition--Long Winded and Too Common Sensical,"Don't know why Bert Decker takes up to 70 pages to establish the contention of connecting with the ""first brain"" when communicating, something that actually should be covered in 5-10 pages at most. He is long-winded and provides cases after cases on speakers who do and do not speak to the first brain.What a big deal about the first brain. Just use the words like ""emotional appeal"" or appeal to audience's emotions. Really disappointed about this so called new edition. Weak and shallow, when it comes to communication skills!Should talk about the communication skills more instead of talking too much about communication theories.The audiobook version is so dreadfully boring and long-winded as well! Could have tightened up the contents and found a better book editor who can do a better job."
4,Classic Jazz Trombone,"This is a very good cd of two albums highlighting JJ Johnson's work in his own group, and in the classic coupling with Kai Winding and a full trombone group. We don't hear this kind of sound in the early 21st century, at least not often. While other albums might feature the J * Kai combination to greater effect, this offers a good extension of that feature."
5,Works as designed,"This is a very handy switch, helped me consolidate a bunch of excess cables into one location which makes it easier to control my lights."
4,Men of the Fighting Lady,"1. I thought delivery was unusually slow (purchased4/22/11, received 5/7/11).2. Movie appears to have been taped from a cableshowing of this movie (Turner)... not an originalversion.3. Quality of images: fair...appear rather fuzzy.4. Found no glitches in movie...no interruptions, etc.5. Overall, I think I was charged too much consideringthe fuzzy quality of this video and slow delivery."
5,Probably the jewel of the Star Wars franchise in the 90's era.,"This is great, the way you can switch between a first person shoot-em-up to a lightsaber 3D action game. Loads of fun. A must have for any gamer who wants to own a historical, impossibly fun game."
3,"Not bad, Not good",I'll keep this short. Anyone who considers the Power Rangers quality viewing will like this movie. Don't expect anything more.
1,swimsuits and music,"There is no nudity in this dvd.This is a music video, and some girls in swimsuits.The customer tags seem to be misplaced."
3,No 3D glasses in my set,"I ordered my set in Jan 2009, and noticed that my dvds did not come with the free 3D glasses. It was indicated on the package that it shd comes in a pack. Amazon had kindly agreed to do the refunding..Great service.One note: i saw the discs (Season 1 and 2) in Singapore's HMV, and both sets' cover design have this ""talking, interactive button"" on the front of the dvd where u can press and the set is supposed to ""talk"". But weird that my season 1 and 2 do not have such design on the cover. Maybe different edition?"
5,3rd Rock -Hillarious as always,This sitcom will keep you laughing. French Stewart is especially funny. It is amazing that he can act this great.
3,"Yes, there is an odor....","I purchased this hoping it would replace my current hair-coloring regimen. The good news is that it does work. I noticed favorable results from the very first application. The bad news is that about 12 hours later, I also noticed an unpleasant odor emanating from my hair. It continued to get stronger throughout the evening. Washing has helped, but has not as yet removed the odor completely. Needless to say, I will not be using any more of the product. What a shame...."
1,Don't ever buy it,"Don't buy ever it. It's not working as described. It makes your scull black. If you wash hair everyday, it would not work for you."
1,Didn't live up to the reviews!,I also bought this game based on the reviews it recieved. This game is definitely lacking the fun and excitement of other board games. We played the game for 30 minutes and it was as pleasant as a root canal. Very disappointing!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"Sub-[price] game, and plays like it.","Granted that this is an inexpensive game, there is no on-screen guides to let you gauge how much power should be used in the serves or returns. Also, there is no guide for targeting, except for the direction in which the little--almost too fuzzy to see--players are pointed. Game play is virtually by rote reaction. Given the overall quality and speed of the graphics, I question whether anyone would REALLY WANT to spend the amount of time that it takes to get used to the control of the game. This game is definitely NOT for children or anyone else who lacks hours of patience to be able to learn just to serve.I expected more, even from an inexpensive game.Mario Tennis for Nintendo 64 is FAR BETTER than this game, even for grown-ups"
2,compass 1400 car seat,"Bought car seat for 3 month old to replace old Graco. He was a big baby, so I thought this would be a great seat, more roomy, etc. It is more roomy, but also considerably bigger in the car. The base seems huge compared to the graco base. Also can't take the car seat without the base -- there is no way to hook just the car seat in a car, no seat belt clips. This also means you can't take it on an airplane. Also, they say it accomadates larger baby, but the shoulder straps only go so far - and this isn't far enough for my 19 lb. baby with a coat on. I would never buy this again."
3,So-so Sophomore,"This album is not as ""Hot"" as I had hoped, but it is definitely one you can press play and find enjoyment in all of the cuts. My favorite is 'First Love'"
2,PLEASE change it all.,"Yes, PLEASE change it all. She sounds great, but the songs aren't. the songs here don't stand out at all, and certainly don't compare to the stuff on her first album.Thanks for trying to take her mainstream, Sony! Completely forgettable."
2,Still in Aww?,"As you noticed by the title I'm still in aww because ""Change it All"" does not live up to ""Even Closer's"" standards. I fell in love with Miss Goapele as soon as I heard the track ""Closer"" and I rushed out to buy the cd. So when her second album dropped I was excited! I bought it, raced home, and played it. By the track 4AM I was very confused. It didn't flow like ""Even Closer"" did and it was like she was Neo-Soul for a minute, Pop for a second, and like R&B for an hour. She was hungry on the first album but seemed to have lost her appetite on the second. This album is not something that I could groove to like her first so I'm still in aww. Hopefully she will make up for this mistake with her third LP....Hopefully"
3,3.5 stars,"It is a shame. This album could have been a classic. The first half of the album is close to flawless and the songs fit her perfectly. But when the ending of the album comes around, everything comes crashing down. Linda Perry?! Goapele, what were you thinking? The second half of Change It All is very boring and has a pop vibe to it. I think she was trying to make some songs that would lead to a crossover, but they are really terrible. I don't know what to say...If the first part of this album was left untouched and released as an EP, it could have done huge things for Goapele and even her genre of music. (And it is even superbly designed.) It really is a shame."
5,Lovely & Beautiful,"The simplicity and elegance of the Criterion packaging and menus mirrors the subtle loveliness of this cinematic treasure. This is by far my favorite gay cinema piece in, well, ever. Saw it in the theatres twice and have watched on Netflix twice and then devoured the Criterion blu-ray and all the extras. An absolute MUST-SEE if you're a fan of cinema - gay or otherwise."
1,A Weekend to forget.,"I was really looking forward to seeing this film after reading many rave reviews of it. This probably compounded my disappointment. My partner and I forced ourselves to watch it until the very end hoping that it would suddenly blossom into a satisfying event.Sadly, it didn't.The problems as we see are fourfold:1. Poor script.2. Poor acting3. Abysmal cinematography4. Retched sound quality (subtitles were essential)It's possible that had it been filmed more as a stage play, it might have been salvaged into something that was, at least, worth watching maybe twice. As it is, I'm selling my blu ray copy on ebay. Unless you really enjoy poor films, don't waste your time."
3,Caveat Emptor : Weekend May Be Incomplete,"As seen in U.S. theaters and On Demand, this is an excellent film. However, the DVD version that is currently available from the U.K. appears to have been edited, especially in the gay-bar scene near the beginning of the film where the two guys meet. I can't speak for Criterion's version but I do know I'm not going to buy it until I know the movie is intact."
1,This is SO Slow!,"This is the worst thermometer I have ever bought. By the time it finishes, my baby is upset because I've had to hold him down forever! I'm throwing it away and will go find something else."
1,disappointed in quality,Product came with a dead battery. Not able to be used until I spend more money for a battery to see if it even works. At such a price you would think they would of sent a working unit.
4,It's fine,"Despite what previous reviewer wrote, have gotten excellent results.Good tonal range, vibrant and true colors. No complaints."
4,Great portable radio,"This is a great, but not perfect, radio. After hearing much about the C. Crane radios and reading reviews, I thought I would give the Sonido a try.I am a UPS driver, and need a portable radio for my package car. This model definitely meets most of my needs. For it's size, it kicks out an adequate amount of volume. It uses 4 D size batteries and a week into it (10 hours a day) it still has 2 of 3 battery indicators remaining.The only knock on it is that there are a couple of AM channels that should be coming in somewhat better than they do. Other than that, I would highly recommend this radio to anyone who is looking for a smaller, attractive, and great sounding radio.**UPDATE**I finally had to change the batteries. At about 80% volume, roughly 10 hours a day, they lasted 14 days...so approximately 130-150 hours. Not bad!"
3,Not the Greatest RPG,"First, let me say I'm something of a fan of A1 games, the people who put this game out. Back in the day, they put out a line of bargain-basement games for the PS 1. They had some Interesting shooters, so I thought I'd try their one RPG. I tend to like RPGs, but this sure isn't any Final Fantasy or Fallout. I found it boreing and a bit silly. If you can get it cheap, give it a try, otherwise pass it by."
2,so-so,"Some good pieces here, but several which are not good. I am a fan of the composer, but I would recomend his other works to see him at his very best. I was disappointed by this one."
4,Forgotten classics,"Until you listen to this CD, you forget how ""big"" Bobby Goldsboro was in the 70s. (I loved his tv show.) This CD contains some classic tunes that you rarely hear on the radio now. The music is terrific, his voice classic. It had been years since I heard the Summer Love song ... wow, it doesn't get much better than that. And Little Things, another song that hasn't lost any of its magic over the years.If you were a child of the 70s, don't miss this one. And even if you are from a younger generation, you will still enjoy this CD."
2,the best of Bobby Goldsboro,"this CD was new in plastic and it skips on 5 songs. the worst part of it is it cost more to send it back then its worth emagin that. ""NOT HAPPY WITH THIS""Carol LarsonHoney: The Best Of Bobby Goldsboro CD"
4,THIS is the Outsiders album you need,"Not only do you get some great music with this cd, you get the beginnings of Climax as well. (The last 2 cuts are essentially Sonny Geraci solo songs done by 1/2 of the band that would play on Climax records)Includes their 4 hits (Time Wont let me, Girl In Love, Respectable & Help Me Girl) and a slew of other VERY like-minded material. If you like any of their 4 hits, you will LOVE the rest. If you like Climax, you should buy this for the 2 last songs which are essentially Climax tunes."
4,Good place to start if you've never read Plato,"It's short and a good place to start if you've never read Plato before. If you dig the Socratic stuff, you'll probably like it."
2,little new info and not enough examples,"This book has some very basic feng shui information in the beginning. Then it has a few chapters for gardens. But the last third of the book are general gardening tips, and not related to feng shui. I would have liked to see more comparisons of before and after, or other more garden-specific suggestions."
2,Why the perfumy odor?,"These spoons have a nasty perfumy odor. I have to wonder what smell are they trying to hide with that perfume? For myself, I will return these rather than take a chance."
1,Trash Bound Calendar,This is my 4th child's calendar I purchased in because of the art which is nice but the contents of the calendar are quite disappointing. There are not many stickers and many of them are blank. The journal entry spaces are the same each and every month which is boring and often irrelavent (1st month What does baby like to eat?). The space for the date on each calendar day is placed in the middle leaving no place to write comments. The month are laid out by the dates such as Sept 16 - Oct 16 would be one month instead of September which is confusing . I am throughly dissappointed with this calendar and wished I had been able to see more of it before purchasing it. I am considering throwing it out and starting over again.
2,"a romance novel, make no mistake","I think that reviving Hale is something of an injustice to other writers who have been perhaps overlooked in the past. This book, at least, is no discovery, but a humid, goofily 'romantic' story, with prose that one could presumably discover in a Harnlequin romance. At least it isn't being foisted upon students."
4,Bel Canto,Was in Peru during the actual hostage drama that this is based on. Very interesting. Loved trying to compare the actual with the fiction.Bought this edition as a gift and recipient was pleased.
3,So much potential,"There's so much potential for great conflict here. A band of poor, armed revolutionaries (the author calls them terrorists but I wouldn't) and a bunch of wealthy hostages. Potential for class struggle, shootings, heartbreak, betrayal, negotiation. Certain scenes become tense but the tension is defused before any harm comes to anyone (between the beginning and end, anyway). Guns are pointed but never fired, threats are made but never fulfilled, secrets shared but never betrayed, love affairs begun but hearts are never broken. So, by halfway through the novel, I gave up on witnessing any real conflict.The epilogue ruined the book for my wife, but I gave up caring about these people long before then."
2,BOOOOOORING!,"This book took me quite some time to get through as I found it to be very boring. The friendships formed and new roles that others learned to take on while be held captive was interesting initially, but at the same time, the same things continued day after day after day of being held hostage. I thought about not finishing this book as I had been reading it for about a month, but thought that may be there would be a great ending...I was very disappointed with the ending as it sounds like other reviewers were. This book is not going to be a keeper on my shelf."
4,What Would You Do,"I would have given the book 5 stars, except for the epilogue. It made me mad.What I loved most about this book was the ideas it made me ponder. I am now questioning what right and wrong in my life is subjective. I would NEVER cheat on my husband. But, can I judge Roxann and Mr H for their actions when Mr H didn't think he'd ever see his wife again (and he didn't see her, at that). If we were snatched from our lives and placed in a whole other society, we would make our own way, correct? What would that way look like?I like books that give me meat for thought."
2,An entire book in which nothing happens.,"Lyrically written, as one might expect in a book infused with opera. In spite of the lovely prose and strong character development, nothing happens that is not described inside the book's front cover! Many dignitaries and one world reknowned soprano are taken hostage by terrorists. Dignitaries and terrorists alike find love and happiness in spite of their circumstances. The hostage situation ends. Such an ending could have been climactic and chaotic, but the author showed no talent for suspense. It seemed that Ms. Patchett had finished developing all of the characters to her satisfaction; and now that the reader could understand the deep implications of the conclusion, she briefly described the story's end and summed up with a disappointing and even more cursory epilogue. Lovely, but boring."
5,Exceptional!,An intimate and catapulting journey into a world that is becoming sadly familiar to all of us. The richly developed characters leave you longing for more at the end of this modern day romantic tragedy.
3,Deus ex macharena,Any sympathy and sense of versimilitude that Patchett may have engendered in her characters in the course of the novel was destroyed by the utterly incredible and unfounded epilogue. What a letdown!
5,a stunning achievement,"Ann Patchett makes startling leaps forward in her craft with each subsequent book. This, following the gorgeous MAGICIAN'S ASSITANT, is no exception. To read BEL CANTO is to be divided in two; half of you falls headfirst into the world of the story, the other half sits back and admires the artistry of the book, as if it were that painting in the museum that compells you to stand and admire it. It is a book to fall in love with, but every once in a while, you pause, shake your head, and think, ""This is art."""
1,"Boring, mis-directed and a realy snoozer","I've read thousands of wonderful fiction books in my life and this has to be one of the worst ever! The book just drags on and on -- I kept reading, hoping that I would come upon a good part, but never did. Don't waste your time."
3,Not quite there...,"Like many of the other reviewers here, I also experienced a distinct moment somewhere past the first 100 pages, where I asked myself ""do I really care what happens to these people?"" At that point, I had little care for any of the characters, must less the relationships formed between them and I couldn't help but dread that I was only at the ""middle"" of the story. When more concrete dynamics finally appeared between characters, I still could not shake a sense of detachment and apathy. Was this book really as beautifully written as others have declared? I can't remember. And the reason I can't remember is because the ending is so ran-out-of-time-slapped-together-sudden and the epilogue is so outrageously preposterous, you won't be thinking about Patchett's prose. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the book for the most part so I say buy the book but I didn't buy the story."
2,Disappointed by the Ending,"Well, I'd give the ending away if I knew that it would keep other people from being frustrated by this book ;) Yes, the writing is beautiful--I won't dispute that--but my gosh, what a letdown. There's a sense of impending doom, of beauty that can't last, of true love that develops in the midst of crisis--but the end is unfulfilling and cold --almost cynical."
2,dragging lackluster,I found the read really boring. The anticipation of a great story just died midway and never picked up. Not sure how it was rated highly in the first place. It was like watching a bad soap opera that just never engaged the feelings correctly.
5,"Beautiful Writing, Captivating Story","I loved this book. I didn't think I would though. I had to read it for a group book read and the topic, hostages, did not appeal to me. But this book is not about hostages at all. It's about who or what you would be if you were taken out of your present role and set free to revision yourself. The writing is beautiful, and Patchett's insights are spot on. I didn't want it to end."
4,Never Mess with the Coloratura!,"The book Bel Canto is not great literature, but neither is it fluff or empty intellectual calories. What it is is an engaging story well told that is hard to put down. The motif is Decameronesque using the event of the terrorist capture of elite party goers to create the set up that allows for the telling of individual stories that orbit around the salvation of art and love--the soprano of the title--the salvation of intellect--the knowledge of the translator which allows these polyglot pilgrims to interact--and the salvation of service--the ineffectual politician/host of the affair. And in its oddly deconstructed way only some but not all who love, who know, or who serve are saved."
4,Terrorist Utopia,"You'll read Bel Canto and get caught up in the development of some unusual and captivating relationships all with a sense of doom. A hostage taking just can not end well but you'll find yourself praying that it will.In some third world South American country guerillas have taken over the Vice President's home and end up keeping 60+ V.I.P.'s and one internationally famous soprano hostage for four months. Incredibly, they begin to build a routine that becomes almost utopian for some of the terrorists and hostages alike.Patchett took her inspiration from the real hostage taking at the Japanese Embassy in Peru six years ago which also lasted about four months. I like her interpretation that human beings will try to make a sense of home wherever they are if they are there long enough and I wish I could find out more about what the experience was for the real hostages.Bel Canto is not great literature but it is a compelling read, I recommend it highly as a book club read."
5,You can't put down this book,"This is the first novel I read by Ann Patchett and it has not only surpassed my expectations it left me wanting to read more. The story line is common, kidnapers and captives start to develop a bonding relationship that is based on their confusion and specific (bad) situation. You know from the beginning of the story how it will end, badly to say the least. But this writer does such an amazing job making you love and understand the characters that you even start to cheer for the continuation of the captivity, for the bending of the rules and success or escape of the so called ""bad guys."" I never cheered so much for the other side as I did here. The novel really makes you think how nothing is ever black and white, good or bad, or can be judged by a single indicator.Aside for the main story line, the descriptions of the interactions between the different nationalities present were so real and quite comic at times."
2,I'm missing something....,"I was excited to read this book after all of the great reviews. Although I like her writing style, the book itself bored me to tears! I continued to trudge along but after being more than halfway through, I've given up. There are too many books on my list and I decided not to suffer through to the end."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype....,"I read this book after seeing the title on several lists - awards and whatnot - and I was very disappointed. I agree with other reviewers who say that any romance under these circumstances would be ridiculous. Once the romances started in earnest, the book became just another romance novel. I'm all for light beach reading, but I hadn't expected this book to be in that catagory.Maybe I should have waited for summer to read it!!"
1,Badly written; badly edited,"Other reviewers have commented on Spanish language errors; apparently the book could have used a ""Gen"" character who could have caught these errors and corrected ""Castle Sant' Angelo"" to ""Castel Sant'Angelo."" And no one sings Tosca several days in a row, which is suggested by ""night after night"" (not to mention, as others have pointed out, singing both Tosca and Gilda!).In an elegantly written novel I could have overlooked such things, but Bel Canto is awkwardly written and full of sloppy grammar. Why say ""side by side with"" when you can say ""beside""? In a paragraph that centers on General Hector, mentions a governess, and nowhere names or refers to Marco's father, we get ""his son, Marco."" Can you imagine a beginning student of English making sense of that? Patchett's misuse of pronouns irritated me so much I had to read the first 60 pages (at which point I stopped reading) with a red pen in hand."
1,Bel Canto: A Tedious Musical Journey,"Let me begin by saying I am an Opera Buff. I am also a singer. So for me to tell you this book is one, long, tedious read is quite a departure from what you might expect. I kept on reading it, bored as I was, because so many people had recommended it I just kept looking for something compelling to happen. For more than 300 pages, nothing much happens. There were some interesting moments at the end, but you shouldn't have to read an entire book to finally discover something compelling. So,unless you like wishful, fantastical plots, stay away from this one."
3,Ugh! Really wanted to like this...,"I love Ann Patchett's books. Her character development is amazing. The stories draw you right in and you have the hardest time putting the book down. However, she really is terrible at conclusions. Books just end so abruptly. Some of them are worse than others and of all her books, Bel Canto and Run are the absolute worst. When I finished this book I went back because I seriously thought a chapter was missing from my copy. I have been reading her books non stop for the past month and I think it is time for a little break."
4,Interesting read,"I think the best part about this book is that it's written in third person. You really get insight from every character. It also unfolds in ways you wouldn't expect. It had ups and downs, as most books do, and it seemed slow at time but I think patchett did a great job. Beautiful writing."
4,"Sweet in story, weak in characters.","What the fiction has achieved is that it combine the music and the terrorism to make a impressive story. As a fan of classic music, opera for sure, I found it amazing. However the story is too sweet and hence a bit weak, especially the characters. A man with the ability of speaking 10 languages? A seeing-is-learning chess wonder? A would-be-tenor in the jungle? These charaters are too artificial to convince me."
4,Freedom in captivity,"This book, with the unlikely juxtaposition of opera and terrorists, is an opera in itself. Patchett captures in language the feeling of opera -- she captures the stage and the fluidity of movement from one moment to the next. But more than that, she captures a sense of freedom. The captives and the terrorists, each forced from their normal lives, finds escape in their forced captivity. From the ""numbers man"" turned pianist to the terrorist turned opera singer, each character is released from their everyday lives to explore the world in new terms. Yes, this is a love story, but more than that it's about the shackles and ties people place on themselves, what they do when they find themselves free of those shackles, and what happens when people are unwilling to let go of their self-imposed imprisonment."
1,"I agree, Fabio should have been on the cover",I seriously cannot believe I wasted my precious time reading this book! The ending is so horrible that I am sitting here wondering what in the heck happened???? I am so dissapointed in the ending that it just soured the rest of the book for me.
2,Don't bother,"This book is boring, pretentious, and overdone. It is obviously the product of a person who has attended the Iowa Writers' Workshop. This is not intended as a compliment. Writers workshops can teach a person to write reasonably well. They cannot make great writers."
3,literature imitates life,"although patchett writes the english language very well, the skeleton of her story is right out of 1996-97 peruvian history. facts: rebels from the peruvian jungle infiltrated the residence of the japanese ambassador during a cocktail party in 1996. the hostages not released, were held for four months. peruvian soldiers dug tunnels under the residence and stormed the residence, killing all the rebels and releasing the hostages. roxane coss is fiction, as is the story involving her."
1,Horrible Ending,"The only saving grace was the sentence structure and her writing style. The plot was long, drawn out and incredibly repetitive. And the ending was terrible... She summed it up in 2 pages. I continued to push through the book, hoping the ending would make it exciting...but alas, I was disappointed. I do not recommend this read."
2,Author didn't do her homework,"Two things I appreciate in a novel are an intriguing plot and beautiful prose. Bel Canto began with the promise of both, but the story fizzled from lack of conflict until the final pages. However, the major complaint I have with this book is that she calls the interpreter a translator. Translators work with documents. Interpreters work with the spoken word. I'm quite surprised that the author didn't research the profession of one of the main characters, and not even the editor caught this glaring error. There could be a gripping tale woven from a situation such as this one, but Bel Canto isn't it."
2,Dull characters and very little plot,"I found it difficult to care about a single character in this book, of which there are many. The author uses the omniscent viewpoint, but fails miserably in developing any one character to the point that oneou can like or dislike them. The plot is very slow, so there is really nothing to carry you on. Even the grammar is sometimes amateurish. Some people adore this book, but they're relating to something in it that I simply cannot locate."
3,The concept was,Too many sub plots. the ending was hard to believe and not developed enough. The concept was good but too many characters.
2,"If you like disappointing endings, this is the book for you","If you like character development that goes nowhere, and an abrupt, disappointing, anti-climactic ending, then this is the book for you. The author did a good job of roping you in for the first 316 pages, and then completely disappoints you in the last 2. The plot literally went nowhere. Why develop characters in superfluous detail, then not tell us what happens to them? It almost seems the author ran out of energy to completely finish the story. You grow to feel for certain characters, then in 1 sentence, they're gone, with no more mention of them. And some of the main characters aren't even mentioned at all during/post climax. What an extreme let down!"
2,Spare,"Many people seem to love this author and while I concur she is a good writer, I find it difficult to believe what she writes about South America. Perhaps it isn't easy for me make the leap with her because I've spent a considerable amount of time in South America and find what she writes about it, even with her self-proclaimed immersion through ""four days of research,"" is not authentic. I found her depictions of South America to be colonial at worst and tedious at best."
2,"Quick, Simple Read","This book is very elegantly and eloquently written. As beautiful as the words are used in this book, I somehow failed to develop an emotional attachment to the characters. I read this book in 4 days, and was unfortunately tired of reading it and was not disappointed when it was done. I was not enthralled by this book. I must say though, I truly appreciate the author's fluid use of words and let the words flow through me as I read it, but honestly, after reading all of the reviews on the book jacket of this book, I was disappointed that as an avid reader of quality literature, I did not find this book to be as good as the many reviews."
2,Blah,This novel was unbelieveable for me. I loved the translator's character and his lover/girlfriend. But everyone else in the novel falling in love like this is some 1960's protest - just ridiculous. All these hostages are in love - ridiculous. It is like Love Actually - all the stories by themselves would be good for a movie but all together - too much - unbelievable. Especially this book - all under a terrorist situation - not happening.
5,"A great, have you jumpin in your seat, dance movie, must see!","This movie was awesome, fast paced, well choreographed, and high energy. Amust see if you like dance, good music."
2,my son never got into it,"He never enjoyed ""eating"" food through a piece of mesh fabric. It was better to just cut the fruit or whatnot into small pieces and let him eat it that way. Nice concept, but it didn't work for us."
3,Don't drop it!,"Really liked this product until it accidentally fell out of the freezer. The lid shattered. I figured I could just use the rest, minus the lid, but I couldn't removed the remaining snap on portion of the lid. It was on there! So I threw the entire thing out.I constantly found both lids to be hard to remove. Yes this is good for baby safety but kinda a PITA."
1,Don't!,"How overrated this album is! It has a good reputation since it was sampled by the Beastie Boys on their Check Your Head CD. It is also rather hard to find and it does'nt come cheap. But what we get here is a not-so-good jazz/blues music played by a very ordinary trio of musicians. Saxophone, bass, drums, no vocals. One of them was a member of the Hollies. Boring. A lost treasure it ain't."
3,Nice toy,"I bought this toy for my 4 year old. He enjoys playing with it, but prefers playing with plain tracks. Beware - Most cars do not work with this set. Also, the curve connectors break over time."
4,This is not played by Mantovani!!!,"Note that the orchestra on this recording is the Orchestra di Mantova. This has absolutely nothing at all to do with ""Mantovani and his Orchestra"" as is wrongly stated by the Amazon listing."
2,This hand pump is not the one for some jobs.,This pump works only if you are pumping from a higher level to a lower level. Basically any tube would do the same thing with gravity siphoning.It will not pump if you want to pump from a lower position to a higher ground.
5,overpriced but Good,The quality of these vent items is great and needed for the toilet to work correctly. The price is really steep but couldn't find another supplier. Brondell makes a quality product.
1,worthless,"After tearing apart my whole stereo system to hook this up. it worked for 10 minutes & then did nothing & ate the cd that was in it. fustrating, door`s will not open... refund requested needless to say"
1,Don't Buy,I bought one of these for my church and it was difficult to use from day one.It broke after 4 months and has a 90 day warrenty.
4,more pleasure from mr. saunders.,"another stellar book from mr. saunders. this fella is the most enjoyable literate author going that i know of. his stories actually are stories, unlike the scraps of pretension that are called stories by so many other writers out there. similar in spirit, i would recommend a book of stories by judy budnitz, titled ""flying leap."" also, an author named kelly link should appeal to fans of george saunders. mr. saunders himself has a new book out which i just purchased and can't wait to read."
2,The Perfect Wedding Cake,"As an experienced cake decorator looking for new ideas, I was not impressed with this book. The examples were a bit staid. I would not even recommend it for new bakers since there are no explicit guidelines for making the decorations, constructing the cakes, etc. I would recommend The Well Decorated Cake by Toba Garrett. The instructions are simple and easy to follow even for the novice. And the recipes are wonderful. I have tested almost every one and had great results the first time."
2,Not impressed,"Sadly, I was extremely underwhelmed by this book. It is just a collection of some above-average cake decorating. There are no instructions on how to make the sugar paste flowers or decorations. A better book would be Margaret Braun's Cakewalk. This book, however, is great for beginners or clueless brides. For us pastry folks, I recommend you pass on it."
2,Don't judge this book by its cover,"The only cake I actually considered from this book was the one on the cover. I was not pleased with many of the other selections on the inside. If you are looking for something traditional, which I am, then this book is probably not for you. Even if you were to find something you liked, I must caution you that this book lacks the instructions needed to be provided to a baker/designer in order to accomplish the re-creation of many of these cakes. There are some impressive masterpieces in this book but none that I haven't already seen displayed in various bridal magazines that I have previously purchased. Also, the cakes in this book carry a heavty price tag so be prepared to go over budget if you decide to set your heart on one of them."
4,Great Book,"This is a big book but it is very useful. I felt it helped integrate theology, psychology and spirituality when approaching Family Ministry."
3,Vocabulary helper,"It helps acquire vocabulary, which is always useful. The book could have more games, using the same words 3 or 4 times, in order to help us memorize them."
2,Good concept but an ultra dated publication,The concept and process can be useful but this book was written in 1950s and republished just recently. The numbers are way off and some legal issues would not apply. However if you are looking for a conceptual and foundation book it's not all that bad. I was just disappointed that it was not being disclosed that this book was written in 1950s.
4,for use with a teacher!,"This book is extremely difficult! For years I keep going back to it thinking I might understand it better but I get stumped very early on. But it is a fascinating book that I will keep because someday, dammit, I will get through it! And my language will SHINE.I bet if I had a tutor then this book would be perfect, but I am teaching myself hebrew and after 10 years(of dabbling) I still can not speak it!"
4,Great Writing,Ths is my first Elizabeth George novel and won't be my last. The author is a very talented author and there was great character development. I will admit that I was somewhat disappointed in the ending as there were a lot of loose ends which were not tied up. I am HOPING there will be a sequel to this nvel so I can find out how everything turned out with her wonderful characters.
4,comprehensive,"This is my first E. George novel. I liked reading it very much, because it is the first mystery novel I have read in a long time which combines social issues(like racism) with well developed characters and plot. I read the entire novel with great interest and my admiration of the writer increased with every page I read. The last part of the novel was somewhat less than believable, and one could feel that the writer was trying too hard to make the ending suspenseful till the last page. But overall, the story and the way it is told is way ahead of the rest of its genre."
1,--- What was all the fuss about?,"I love mysteries and was excited to read ""Deception on His Mind"" after all the great reviews -- especially since I'd never read Elizabeth George before. What a huge disappointment! I found her use of the language awkward and amateurish, (the slang especially seemed very self-conscious) and all of the characters were dismally one-dimensional. The plot was certainly complex and the murderer nobody I had anticipated, but it took a huge suspension of disbelief to accept the solution. George would have done better to have stopped one plot twist earlier.Overall, a big, disappointing waste of time."
5,East Side History,"Fantastic book about the area where I was born & raised. Many personal connections for me, such as the trunk on p.16 belonging to my grandfather. He used it when he came to Chicago from Texas. Today the trunk is in my sister's dinning room! I dont know who the woman sitting on the trunk is but there is a picture of my grandfather on p.114. He is man kneeling at the bottom left of the bottom picture on the page. There is also a picture of my aunt, one of my grandfathers five daughters, on p.93. She is second from the right in the bottom picture.This book should be required reading for the school children on the East Side, it is historically very accurate.If you are looking for a book that details the ground up development of a of a major industrial center and the people that made it happen, this is it."
1,never received it.,I rec'd the wrong book and I never heard if it was rec'd back toyou. When this is cleared up I want to try again
5,k and n filter,This was an exact replacement for the air intake system that I already owned. I purchased it to have an extra filter while cleaning the other one. Spent about 3 hours researching the best prices and amazon hands down had the best price. Amazon made it easy to find the exact product that I needed. Free quick ship option was selected and recieved within 3 days.
2,Not Very Good for Those Who Want to Sail Small Boats Inland,"I bought this book to refresh my knowledge of sailing small sailboats in inland lakes after a 15 year hiatus from sailing, and didn't find it very appropriate. As others have mentioned, there are also a lot of typographical and editing errors, which is odd considering it was written as an aid to certification.There was a lot of information about coastal sailing, but I'm willing to bet that there are a lot more sailboats in the 14' or less range than larger ocean-faring sailboats. At the very least, if I was the author of this book I would mention it's target audience on the cover, or change the name to coastal sailing fundamentals."
5,The Best Sailing Manual Ever Written,"Jobson makes sailing easy for anyone to understand. If you're new to the sport, this is the book to read. If it's the only book you're going to buy - you won't be sorry! I used this book as ASA certification, but that does not limit the usage for general knowledge."
5,Melissa & Doug score again!,"These puzzles (bundled) are a great deal and present the potential for hours of fun for little ones. With some help, our two year old throughly enjoys these; they're just complicated enough to keep her coming back to try them time and again, but not so much so that they're overwhelming or defeating. The wooden pieces are very durable but the paper picture on top can peel up easily if picked at (as often happens with toddlers). A good stick of glue will keep these puzzles looking like new for years."
4,expand the age range,"These puzzles are quality puzzles. They are not easy puzzles for toddlers starting puzzles with interlocking pieces. If a toddle could see a picture of the puzzle on the board, a first timer toddle could use there matching ablilities to facilitate the transition. This could broaden the age/skill range of the puzzles."
2,Must Try Harder,"Very disappointing book, not really what you would expect for the money. Sparse on detail and rememeber a lot of what is in here will be out of date December 17 Weblogic luanches 6.0 and with EJB 2.0 this book will most be redundant, unless you want to build the front end for a Pizza ordering site !!"
1,Very disappointed,I bought this book hoping that it covers the topics in the GRE CS exam. Found out that the first 4 chapters are just general talk (chitchat) and does not explain/review the concepts in the exam. The sample test is very poor and I believe some of the questions were answered incorrectly. I am returning the book because it does not worth a penny! It is sad that I am losing shipping fees.
1,This book is an embarassment!,"I can't believe how bad this book is. There are so many glaring mistakes, it is ridiculous! A lot of the answers that they say are correct are obviously wrong. The author of this book should be ashamed. Buy this book only if you want to perform worse on the GRE exam."
1,Disturbingly bad.,"Like other reviewers, I bought this book because it was in-stock. Like other reviewers, I found the book... lacking in correctness. It's hard to study for a test from a book that has incorrect answers. I have _ZERO_ confidence that this book has in ANY way prepared me for the CompSci GRE test :( I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this, and both the author and publisher will be getting a nastygram about this one."
4,Good Keyboard,I bought this keyboard to use for my laptop when I had it connected to my LCD TV so that I could surf the web/watch videos on my TV. It works greats has a good range and was inexpensive.
2,"Nice when it works, which is less than more often","We have a computer hooked up to our TV, so we needed a wireless keyboard so we can sit in the living room, use the computer and watch programs or use the internet on our TV. This keyboard freezes up constantly, needs to be reset, and about 80% of the time does not reset correctly or after the first try (more often after about 30 minutes of frustration).The battery cover in the back is completely flimsy and poorly made. Ours does not stay on, and we asked the company for a replacement that we have yet to receive.This keyboard is nice when it works, but you spend more time wanting to throw it at your TV screen that actually using it to watch online TV."
1,Budget price = Budget product,"I received this as a Christmas present after (foolishly) putting it on my list. Let's just say I regret costing my brother $65. Right out of the box, it didn't work. I adjusted the batteries, played around a bit with the USB receiver, and it finally connected. After about 10 minutes of use, it disconnected. Repeated steps 1-2, used for an hour this time, and it stopped working again.So I called tech support and got the answering machine. 10 times in a row, on 10 different days. Emailed them. Never got a response.My advice is to spend your money more wisely and get a better product. This one is not it."
4,Works well,"The keyboard works well the only issue I have is- If one leaves the computer for over a few minutes, (I assume around 15 minutes) you have to press a button on the usb wireless stick in order to reactivate it. For me this is a little annoying, other than that I,m satisfied with it."
2,Broke after a few months,"Very good ergonomic design. My young children could use this keyboard with no problem to browse around on the PC that is connected to our big screen t.v. Would rate it 5 stars except ...After about 6 months it broke. None of the letter keys work. If I press the ""P"" key it tries to print. It's as if the ctrl key is stuck down and so any letter key pressed is really ctrl-plus-the-letter. So I have to throw it away.Went to Adesso web site to try to get technical support. Chat option always says ""offline."" Sent them an email 5 days ago with no response back. Tried calling their 800-467-1195 number and keep getting a busy signal. This keyboard is a bit pricey, if it were a $20 keyboard I might just shrug it off but for this somewhat expensive price I expected better. I just ordered the BTC 9019URF for only 30 bucks and I'll see how that one goes."
1,Pure Junk - Most Frustrating POS Ever,"Wow - where to start - this was such a letdown that it ended up smashed on the floor. At best, it would move the curser and click ok but when you went to type any text, it would just skip about 25% of what was typed. So it would take you a long long time to type anything out that would work. It ate batteries big time which alone makes this a very expensive gadget to own - oh yeah, you'll be replacing way more batteries than you need to because you'll be blaming the batteries on it's poor performance. My advice is not to walk but run away from this piece of junk."
1,Really crappy keyboard,The layoout is really a great isdea. The problem is skips keys so frustrating that my husband punche this pOS out. and keys went flying everywhere. the beauty is they are very easy to snap back on. and the Pos stil works exactly tthe same this was our third try on tthis model. i dindn't use spell ceck so you could see exactly what you get when typing on this pile. don't buy
5,"Great keyboard, easy to use","Purchased keyboard for use with a computer linked to HDTV in living room. Range is good, can sit on couch 10 feet away and no problems. Nice mouseball roller and buttons. Easy and convenient."
1,stay away,"this is the worse's product which i ever use not working properly at all , if distance more then 8 feet not working at all. Mouse not working correctly not easy to operate. CRAP ..."
2,Good/Bad,"It works flawlessly the first time day. A day or two later it starts to miss key strokes and or simply not register the device. I've found that I can remedy the issue where it won't recognize the keyboard - just take the batteries out and put them right back in. It works every time, which is a pain in the ass, but I'm too busy to bother with sending it back again. I sent the first one back in hoping it was a fluke, but apparently not.I tried everything. It's within 10 feet, no obstructions, exchanged the batteries, tried another usb port etc. It's a shame too b/c when it does work, the mouse ball is great, the keys and their location are ergonomic.All I can think of is the possibility the 2.4 Ghz spectrum is busy in my area. I'm in an apt and I'm sure nearly everyone has a router that's 2.4 Ghz. Bluetooth probably would have been better for my situation, 5+GHz would have been even better..."
4,It's not perfect,"On the one hand, this keyboard is junk. On the other, what keyboard isn't? As an every day typing machine, there's not many nice things I can find to say about it. As a remote control for a dedicated media PC, it's about as good as it gets. Once you get used to the layout, you can get around pretty intuitively. For a dedicated media PC, I can heartily recommend this keyboard. For an every day, multi-purpose, or work PC, this is not what you want."
3,great while it lasts.. but something is weak in it.,"I have owned 2 of these. I use them on my media center.The first lasted about a year. Then the receiver mysteriously stopped recognizing the keyboard.The next lasted me about 2 days before the same situation happened.More than a little cursing happened.I don't know if its a lack of hot-swap-ability or something else but the keyboards still work but my receivers are fried. they still think they work, but they don't connect to the keyboard. Mac's give me the ""I need to identify the keyboard"" script and pcs just sit there dumb.BUT if you're willing to give it a chance.. its quite comfortable and easy to use on the lap or couch.There are much better keyboards out there but not too many with a track ball included."
2,"Better than average design, but very poor construction (haywire after 2 months)","For the 2 months that it worked, it was better than other mini keyboard/trackball combos that I've tried (but that is not saying much at all, since they are almost all terrible). One thing I liked most about this over others was that it rarely needed to be resynched. The trackball worked pretty well for being so tiny, and the mouse buttons/scroll wheel were nice.But today, after using the keyboard for probably only 5-15 minutes per week over the last couple of months, it has gone haywire. Pressing most keys on the keyboard now results in the keyboard sending multiple keystrokes to the computer. For example, the ""g"" key sends ""gv"". I'm past the Amazon 30-day guarantee, so I'll have to try to deal with the manufacturer Adesso."
4,Excelent product...works perfect...,just some times (few) cursor stops and after 5 seconds it starts to work again...
1,Great Design - sure wish it worked,"When I first received this keyboard it worked awesome, exactly what I was looking for! After a month of normal use the 1,2,3 and 4 keys stopped working. So I sent it back in. After jumping through many hops to find the manufacture and getting a new keyboard the new trackball on the keyboard stops working after about 20 min of not using it (like watching a movie on your HTPC). To get it to resync I had to remove the batteries, very weird, but still got the trackball problem.I may have just been unlucky and got 2 bad keyboards but that's tough to do. I'm a 41 yr old with 20 years of computer and communications exp for what it's worth."
5,great mini keyboard,bought this mini keyboard so I could use my big screen TV as a monitor for my laptop. Works even better than I hoped. I almost never leave reviews but I am so pleased with this item I felt compelled to praise it online. Thanks.
2,No Cemetery Nights,"Cemetery Nights is an important and influential book of poems but in no way will Carnage be this, there is a boring artificiality to much of this work and a lack of engagement with anything resembling that which I would call important. Doyns strength for years was his tenacious psycholical insight. His poems were microcosms of emotional conflict and imaginary moves. But that is the main problem with this book. Where is the imagination? What do these poems offer me, ask of me, give to me, say to me that isn't obvious, at times even dull."
2,"Amatuerish, Repetitive, Monotonous","Referring to forgettable early-80's guitarist Mike Stern as ""white boy"" is bad enough, but when the author lapses into Milesisms and diverges into humdrum explorations of Sly Stone and Hendrix, one wonders if he hasn't much to say at all outside of his noble advocacy of the widely panned On the Corner album. The book on the whole smacks of 70's rock music magazine journalese, and, petrhaps aware of his own inadequacies, he doesn't spare Paul Tingen in any references to that flawed but nonetheless superior study of Davis' electric period."
1,Very fishy company,"I installed it on my 12 y.o son comp to control his acts,but when some got wrong=customer service was kinda fishy-u can smell it."
1,SCAM,"PURCHASED SOFTWARE FOR TWO COMPUTERS AFTER ONE YEAR BOTH PROGRAMS STOPPED WORKING, AFTER CONTACTING COMPANY THEY WANTED TO SELL ME SERVICE CONTRACT . STAY AWAY FROM THIS SOFTWARE THIS IS A RIPOFF, UNLESS YOU WANT TO PAY FOR PROGRAM AND YEARLY FEE AFTER THAT."
2,I like PICTURES in my Cookbooks....,I have tried several of the recipes and they have all been tasty but have been very dissappointed since I received this book because there are no pictures. I like to see what the food looks like before I read the recipe and was very dissappointed to find no pictures in this cookbook and I wish I had known that before purchase (I would not have bought it). Also many of the recipes are for 8 or more servings...that is a lot of food for my family of three. I recommend a subscription to Cooking Light Magazine instead.
5,Great tasting and low calories.,"I have tried many of the soup recipes and love them all. The artichoke soup is my favorite! I am working my way through the wonderful, fun cookbook. I a on Weight Watchers and each recipe has the nutritional values which makes it easy to convert to WW points. Highly recommend. I live in the New Orleans area and the book suits me fine!"
4,Classic!,Wonderful story told through dedicated professionals - both singing & artistry of sets. Quality of film / production worth the purchase.
3,Bemused Boheme,"Another case of trying to be inovative and clever...especially the ending with Mimi's death and scene change to a street and Rudolpho running up the street crying ""Mimi!"" Fairly well sung but distracting direction and to what purpose? See and hear the Australian production with wonderful young singers, beautiful sets, costumes,and staging."
2,Need a better version,this must be transfered from edited for TV film rolls.the color of the picture was off but at least clear.all the erotic scenes are gone.Expecting an uncut remastered DVD to be released.
4,Alright,"I would give the game 4 stars. First of all the game kept messing up and sometimes it even froze. Sometimes i lost because somebody died and the next time i won with the person dieng. I dont know if it's suppose it be that way but i am confused. If you have seen the movie and know who Ghost, and Niobe are you get to choose wither one of those characters and fight to save Zion with them. I thought you would play with either Morphies or Trinnaty but you dont. Those are the down falls about the game. It's awesome because the weopans are tight and the moves you can do with the characters are awesome. If you are a Gamer and are looking for a game i would reccomend to buy this one. OKAY GRAHICS."
3,THE MATRIX'S 1ST MISTAKE,IN ENTER THE MATRIX YOU CAN DODGE BULLET AND DO MARTIAL ARTS MOVES THAT ARE PURE MATRIX STILE. BUT THIS IS THE MATRIX'S BIGGEST MISTAKE AND MOST DISSAPOINTING PRODUCT. IN A MATTER OF MINIUTES I WAS ON LEVEL 8 AND BY 45 MIN. I WAS ON LEVEL 17. THERE IS ERY LITTLE CHALLENGE FOR THE BEGINING AND I AM NOW AT A LEVEL WHERE I CONSTANTLY MAKE PATHETIC MISTAKES. I HOPE THEY MAKE A BETTER VERSION SUNE!
4,fun but fast,I'm just renting this game. the controls are very easy and fun to use. graphices are asome. the sound riases the roof. Story cool. Then why did I rated 4 instead of 5 you ask? 2 day i'd had it amd beated it. This thing is 2 disks long for crying out loud! If the only they made the missiens a littel bet longer it would be a 3 disc game. I know the reason it's slow. (Dane it) The movie clips are DVD clear. The game isen't made after the game. it's like a sequel. it shows stuff that goes alone the movie.In the movie it's goes with neo and morfeues. in the game it goes with neopole and goust. same story but on diffret side of it. cool game but short.
4,"Well,it was kind of wierd","the place that i ordered the sims (GC) off of it told me that it was in good condition witch could mean that might have a few scratches here and there but no it would play just fine but then after a wile my wii started to lag and 3 secs after that it completely froze and i figured it was just the cd since it wasnt in perfect condition ya know but after it hapened a few more times i got curias and i google searched and i found out why it does that and its becouse since sims it a huge game that it acualy made my gamecube stop working so this is just a fare worning to you guys who plan to get this game,if you play the first sims for a long peried of time anof IT WILL CRUD UP YOUR SISTEM!!!!"
3,Ok,"Bought 2x pair back in 2008. OK, not great. Not designed for people with bigger than average heads. So if you're tall and have a big head get yourself adjustable ones."
3,Average to Below Average,"If you get it dirt cheap, it is about what you'd expect.It says light weight, it's not. Not the most comfortable either, but could be worse. Frame construction seem less than par to me. It is solid though, and if you need to adjust them to fit your nose & ears better, they are easily bendable, and they don't feel like they might break.I think you can do a lot better than this, and I most certainly will be shopping for a different pair soon."
2,Don't Float this boat,"Chewy animals are great for babies - just the right size to hold and for ""teething."" However, the ark tended to fill up with water, didn't float very well...hard to get the water out. Also the ark and its cabin were a bit hard and bulky for little hands to grasp. I tossed the ark but kept the animals."
3,"buy it for the chewy animals, not for the boat","The animals are great bath time fun - my one year old loves them. As for the not-so-floatable boat, what's suggested on the product package ""boat really floats"" is somewhat technically correct: the yellow boat base does float. The ark as a whole, however, sinks, so it's really misleading advertisement on behalf of the maker. So don't buy it if you want a floating bath time ark - it won't happen. Also, the yellow boat base has a hole on its underside that mysteriously allows water in, but never lets it out again..."
3,Great teething toy!,"We've yet to bring this toy into the bath - it has been our daughter's number one choice for a teething toy! The animals are, well, chewy! Unfortunately, we are already missing two of the animals (we suspect the dog likes them too) and we probably won't bring them into the tub since other parents complain about the water getting stuck (I can see that happening, the holes are pretty big). But if you're looking for a great, soft teething toy, this is a good choice!"
2,Not for water,"It's very cute and my daughter likes the animals. But don't put it in the bath or pool. Water gets in and it won't come out. I was disappointed because it was sold as a ""bath toy""."
3,Waterlogged!,"My son has had this arc set since he was about 6 months old- he's 2 now. I stubbornly keep it in the bath tub, but it's really not much use as the pieces fill up with water. You can squirt the water out of the animals, but the boat parts are too big and hard for that. It doesn't float at all, and come to think of it, it was never really well-balanced even when it was new and empty."
4,Instructions say not for bath,"We bought lots of different things to help our 8 month old daughter with teething - this is her favorite. She loves to chew on the animals - it is a great toy for teething - but if you read the insert that comes with the toy, it says NOT to submerge in water. It is a teething toy. She really loves the giraffe - it is her favorite!"
2,A surprisingly bad book by j. oke,"I was bored stiff reading this novel. I think J. Oke needs to slow down and take some time to think between writing each book. I thought it was very unrealistic how quickly the two young ladies became friends considering they didn't speak the same language. This action was sooooooooooooooooo slow. I prefer Oke's more exciting books like the Canadian West series, A Woman Named Damaris, and A Gown of Spanish Lace. They aren't overly sappy and their characters do more than just hug and cry."
5,Original Store Line,"I would highly recommend this book because of the original story line. The story was unlike any other that I had read. When I came to the end I had to have the next book to see what happened, and of course, I wanted to read the remaining ones. Janette provided some very good lessons with having faith, and how to handle decision making in our life with the help of God. It's a five-star book in my opinion."
4,Worth Reading,"This book was worth reading but there was one downside. The beginning was really slow and I had a hard time getting through it. I almost stopped reading. Once you get through the beginning, however, it is a REALLY good book and definitely worth reading."
2,The Art of Conversation : Magic Key to Personal and Social P,"Quite dated in style and content. Has some good general principles, but not much depth or followup on them. Never goes below the surface of the small talk level. Geared towards salesmen."
2,Beautiful phone with very poor range,"Several days ago I bought a VTech phone identical to the i5881 but without the answering machine component. Loved the cool design (especially the bright blue indicator lights). The phone had all the features I wanted including base keypad and speakerphone and expandable handset capacity. The problem is that it has the worst range of any cell phone I have ever owned. We keep the base set in the kitchen at the back of the first floor of our house and I can't get any remote handset reception in our bedroom in the front of the second floor. Our house is big but not huge. Its a wood framed house not solid masonry or steel which can block reception. Tonight I am returning the phone to the store where I bought it. One other minor problem that I could have lived with, had the reception quality been better: the dial buttons on both base and the handset are very tiny...hard to see for aging baby boomers like me."
5,Best phone I've ever owned,"I've had this phone since 2003 and have never had a problem. In fact, I'm here looking for additional handsets today."
3,POOR PERFORMER,"WELL, thirsty, dries in a week so starting gets difficult ( Holley never does ) poor mpg, some hesitations off the idle, I'll go to Holey 750cfm double pumper. Befere i used an Edelbrock Qjet Performer RPM and was no better.( 468ci Olds engine mild but thorough preped wit blueprinting and mods )"
2,Horrible Gameplay,"This was one of the games I was looking forward to for some time.The graphics are pretty good and the concept is excellent. The storyline by the actual directors is also a great touch.But all of that is absolutely meaningless if the game play and most importantly the game controls are simply horrible. There is no intuitiveness here. You run through the level and get surprised and die, then you try again and you won't be surprised and pass as exciting as fixing a car by trial and error.I'd avoid this game if I were you, rent it if you don't believe me but don't drop 50 to Atari's coffers for this mediocre game."
1,Sloppy Sloppy Sloppy,"Maybe I am a putz. But maybe this is just a lousy game. The graphics are not bad, the storyline is a little weak. But the controls suck and that makes for a lousy game. In first person mode, the controls are way too sensitive, and you cannot change the sensitivity or the up down orientation. The characters do things you do not want them to do, turn whatever way they want, stick to the wall when you do not want them to, refuse to when you do. The camera goes off on an angle you do not want. In fact, playing next to walls, I have seen nothing but the wall on the screen while the character is fighting.Personally, this game had a lot of hope. But poor controls, and lousy logic in certain areas make this game a major disappointment. Do not waste your money."
2,Loved the Movie- Disapointed by the game !,"With all the hype around this game and the way they sold it as arevolution in gaming and interactive media - the Matrix DID NOT DELIVER!.There is nothing new or innovative.Game-Play:Similar to max Payne, with the bullet time feature however you don't really need much skill to play this &#65533; no chalange at all - the coolness of the martial arts moves ware off fast and the Driving Levels were absolutely boring !Graphics:-The Graphics are average and in some cases bad ""The Car models were really bad"" the cut-scenes however are the best I&#65533;ve ever seenMusic - Excellent sound track and voice over actingStory - How can you go wrong it is the Matrix !I don't think this game is worth [the money]- maybe a rental tosatisfy your curiosity- nothing more !"
2,"Awesome story, horrible graphics and gameplay","Story - A+Playability - DThe controls for this game are completely non-intuitive, no matter which of the three settings you choose. Using a joystick as a toggle button? Come on.It is also obvious that this was a very quick port to XBOX, since the graphics are pretty pad. Motion capture ""noise"" is evident in characters who look very shifty and jerky most of the time (as if they are drunk or something). Also, things like enemies guns and even dead bodies seem to penetrate walls A LOT. More evidence that the engine for this game is not quite fully baked.Overall, this game had a lot of potential, and is still quite playable, but fails miserably to take advantage of the hardware, does not promote exploring the virtual world, and has counter intuitive controls. Overall, it is not worth full price, but alas will sell well due to its title."
2,It's a rental,Pros:- Bullet time.- Music gets you in the rhythm of the game.- Blowing up cars in the car chase sequence is a fun distraction.Cons:- Repetitive.- Cannot strafe! How do you dodge bullets in bullet time if you can't strafe?!- Graphics on XBOX is very poor- looks like they took the lowest common denominator of graphics and just cloned it for each platform rather than chosen higher resolution textures or applied antialiasing.- Bullet time effect does not show up in cut scenes.- Camera gets in the way of the fight scenes.Recommend playing Bloodrayne instead and enable bullet time all the time. You get much more satisfaction of seeing bad guys getting diced up into tiny little bits in slow motion....
3,Pros and Cons,These are the pros and cons of the game (with a few extra things)ProsWeaponsCool Moves with FocusConsGameplayGraphicsCheeseGreatest Moment:Pausing the game to sit on da jon.
3,Probably has more effect if you got it before Reloaded,"This was okay for a run around shooter, but I got bored at some parts. Niobe was cool, but Ghost was a bit lame. The graphics were good, and the sound reminded me of the Matrix. (Go figure.) It would have been nice if they could have added a hard core porn scene between Niobe and Trinity..."
4,Enter the Matrix only once,"Enter the Matrix is a quality game graphics wise. The characters are beautifully detailed and most of the levels are well thought out (excluding the hovercraft and most of the sewer levels). However, the gameplay can become very tedious at times, especially while playing as Niobe. It is apparent that Niobe was intentionally made to be a tougher charcter to play as, because of the driving and hovercraft piloting (both were thrown in there as last minute levels, as it is evident that the levels were there just a hype). Then again there are some levels that take less that two seconds to complete, such as The Return to The Great Hall in the Merovingian's chateau. In that level, the only objective is to run ahead 3 feet! Overall, the game is ok, but was put out waaaay to early. Rent this one first."
3,Umm....,"It's pretty in its own way, especially if you add some berries for color. Otherwise it kinda looks like a dead animal."
4,Great game but can be better,"Winning eleven does not have all of the feautures ea's fifa soccer has. Some teams do not have the real names and some do, and the club teams are not actualized and they do not use real names. But it is a great soccer game, I played fifa and it was cool but then I played this game, and you feel a lot more free to do great plays. This game requires a lot more of skills to play than fifa, and once you master the controls you can play great matches. One of the things I like the most is that players can use their body to protect the ball, you can score a bicycle kick once in a while and you can even dribble the goalkeeper.The graphics are not too good, but the gameplay will not let you notice that.In conclution, if you are looking for a soccer game that is going to make you jump off your seat when you score, well winning eleven is the one closest to that."
1,Good A.I. but horrible basics.,"I admit this game as good A.I., but the names of the national team members were dead wrong. I don't know who did the research, but he/she should be fired! How do you get the names of the national team members? It is so easy to find the names on the internet. I just can't believe that a video game company would get the names wrong. If you don't care for those basic fundamentals of a game, get this game for its good A.I."
4,Realistic... Maybe too much,"This is the most realistic soccer game available today. But hard to play... Be prepared to spend a lot of time learning it.This is a little different from the Japanese version, so don't expect the exact same game."
4,"A good tale, but...","I enjoy reading McCarry's books, especially The Last Supper. But there was no mention in The Better Angels of airplanes flying into American buildings. Stolen nukes, yes, but no air threat."
2,Khan-spiracy,"I purchased this book through a book club at a dramatically reduced price, even at that I am disappointed. It is a big, beautiful book, but it is superficial and skin deep. Rykwert's essay, while competent, is brief. The photographs are beautiful, however the graphics (plans and sections) that are so essential to understanding Kahn's work are almost non-existent. Most projects contain only one floor plan that is usually ""floating"", i.e. devoid of any context. There are no sections or elevations. Seldom is there a site plan. If you have all or most of the books on Kahn and feel you need another, then perhaps this book is for you. If you are looking for a nice Kahn coffee table book, this book is for you. If you are looking for an in-depth understanding of this master architect, than I suggest other sources, such as the MoCA ""In therhealm of architecture"" catalogue published back in 1991."
4,Not Bad!,"A new third edition for playstation. The game is not bad. It is a lot of fun to play. Every time you play it, you never want to stop until you win the million. But there are a few bad things about this game. It still is a little slow like the second edition for playstation, some of the phone a friends don't give you an answer because they don't know it, most of the questions are really tough, it only gives you 30 seconds to answer, you can't download new questions like the computer version, and there are only 100 more questions than the second edition. But overall the game is fun. Too bad I couldn't give it 5 stars because of those bad things. But still I encourage everyone to buy it. The music and the effects makes it seem so real. So Let's play Who Wants To Be A Millionaire 3rd Edition!"
2,Full of Scribbles by ex owner,It is a great little book but this copy was a mess and should never been put out there with it being full of underlines-color marking all thru it.
2,A beginners manual...,"The substance of this book is a comparison of email marketing promotions from Amazon, B&N, and Borders. Some interesting numbers are presented but, overall, this book is nothing more than a primer for those entering the eMarketing field. I question some of the conclusions which the author arrives at given the limited number of participants (182) in his own ePromotion campaign.Not a bad book but there certainly are others I would pursue with greater vigor than this one."
3,Not The Greatest Of Jackie Chan,"The lack of complex fight choreography, humor and interesting characters makes this movie one of the few of Jackie Chan's that I don't really care for all that much. I would so much rather watch The Legend of Drunken Master than this film again."
1,This is why I now listen to Kelly Clarkson,"I don't know what they were thinking with this disc, Gravity was amazing, they rocked out, and now they are trying to sound like Train or something and they are not doing a good job of it. I'm 27 and grew up on late alt-rock, and they were the last of the great late 90s bands to turn to crap. The rest of the list: Everclear *Slow Motion Daydream (worst EC album ever)* - Bush *Institute (take every BAD Bush song"
1,MORE CONTENT PROTECTED CRAP,"WTF IS WRONG WITH MUSICIANS TODAY, YOU CANT PLAY THIS ON ANYTHIGN IN YORU COMPUTER!!! DONT BUY THIS CRAP"
1,Ummmm,"Okay.. hmmm.. what the heck happened to OLP? What the heck are they doing, thinking, expecting with such a weak effort? If I could pick one work to describe this album, it would surely be tacky. Its really frightening how many bands, when signed to major recording labels, become more and more homogenous. OLPs sound is ruined forever. If you're a true OLP fan don't buy this album and send the band a message! Where are the lyrics that would invoke emotions stuck so deep that it was cathartic to say the least??? I'm completely baffled........"
4,A Good Listen...,"The legendary alternative pop rock band's latest album, Healthy in Paranoid Times, is not what I and probably the rest of the OLP fans have expected. I, along with others, expected it to be another Gravity; pretty, but mainstream rock. Nothing special or out of the ordinary.Healthy In...'s first single, ""Where Are You"" proves to be slightly misleading. A fairly bland rock song. But as the album begins, it proves itself otherwise with acoustic guitars and unusual chord progressions. In comparison to other albums, it has the mainstream feel of Gravity, but a style of rock that we have not seen from Our Lady Peace yet. A normal rock feel, with original chord progressions and a constant aura of unpredictability.Not a classic OLP creation, (my favourites being Happiness... and Spiritual Machines), but an interesting listen. An overall feel-good rock album."
2,INCREDIBLE DISAPOINTMENT!!!!!!!!,"I could write a big review on what went wrong on this album, but it only takes to listen at it to figure out, so I'll just say I hope this is just a down on OLP's career like so many great bands have had and that they'll recover and make great music like they used to.This was supposed to be the return of OLP to their roots, and in some way it is but not the return to good music, just the return to rock music, it is a lot more rock than gravity but still nothing like Clumsy or hapiness..., anyway I just hope they'll make better music in the future... and of course BRING MIKE BACK!!!!!!!!"
1,computer wrecker,"My 10 year old son bought this book and all it did was wreck my computer with trick downloads and addware from all kinds of sights. This book belongs in the garbage! Thankyou.Dancing Hamsters, Gothic Gardening, and Cyber Conspiracies: The 501 Funniest, Craziest, & Most Bizarre Web Sites You'll Ever See"
5,Buy it!!!,"I had the pleasure of seeing Pirates of the Great Salt Lake at a special screening in late 2007. It is such a shame this movie did not get widescale release in the theaters. It is offbeat, crazy, and funny. I would have thought that distributors would have learned something from the success of Napolean Dynamite. Although, obviously not a big budget production POTGSL has alot of talent and alot of heart. With all the pig fodder that comes out in the name of ""entertainment"" POTGSL is a breath of fresh air. It is very much worthy of a DVD collection. Don't miss!!!"
3,An old lady's review...take with a grain of salt.,"I don't think I'm the right demographic for this film but I wasn't a huge fan. As a fan of both literature/poetry and history I thought this would be an interesting take on Dante's famous work. I suppose it was interesting and creative but my attention was constantly diverted from the story by the animation. The narrative flowed nicely but lacked detail where they needed more and used too much detail where brevity would have suited the scene better.This might be a good introduction to epic poetry for a younger audience, but those over 30 might be a bit turned off by the graphics and brashness of the film."
3,Pretty average animated film,"This review will be from the viewpoint of someone who hasn't done any prior research into anything relating to Dante's Inferno. In other words, I've never read any books or played any videogames based on this character/story.With that said, I felt this animated film was pretty average. It wasn't very entertaining but it wasn't really bad either. The animation quality is alright but the film seemed kinda soft/blurry and the color quality washed out. The story was ok but I did like the voice acting. I wasn't really expecting big things from this DVD at least nothing on the level of a Disney animated film. This film didn't even get me to watch it from beginning to end in one sitting...there wasn't anything about it that compelled me to watch it. Honestly I just watched it in order to write a review. The film does have a lot of violence so this is definitely not a children's DVD."
4,Come on and dance with... Kylie,"this is an excellent track from an overlooked album, wich only has sold 2 million copies around the world not bad, but when fever sold 7 million thats something.... well this cd single includes album track Sweet Music wich is great 10/10and the 8 Medicine remix should be called The Body Language Remix, just that line is repited all over the mixthe video i think could've been much better but you know, what's done it's done"
3,Not What I Expected,"I gave her 3 stars becasue she is Kylie and I love her. i really was looking forward to a new US release but I hope it is not this song. I feel it will go nowhere here with the US being very tough critics especially with dance music as you can tell from our charts. This song is slow just like the title and I really did not like it or the next song. The remix is sort of repetitive and not done very well, but the video is great casue she always looks great. She even looks great on the cover although it does not look like her much. If you are expecting a reoccurance of her last album with this single do not buy it becasue you will be disappointed. If you just wanna hear and see new kylie music then get it."
4,Valdez is Coming,"This was my first Elmore Leonard western. It was very enjoyable, and it kept me interested all the way. The dialogue was wonderful. I'm very close to giving it 5 stars, but will make it 4. I purchased Leonard's Hombre and will be reading it soon."
4,Great Headset but Issues with Teamspeak,"These sound great, feel great, and are a slight step up from the non-V2 Steelsounds and the Senn 165's I have owed previously. The problem I have with them is that my game sounds somehow leak through the mic and drives the other people on Teamspeak crazy. This happens even with the game volume fairly low and the mic extended away from the cups as far as possible. From what I've been reading on some boards this is a problem many others are experiencing."
3,Depends on your usage,"Pros:Very comfortable3.5mm jacks (for those who don't want to screw with USB for audio)Game performance (i.e. sound effect distinctfulness)Cons:Build quality is mediocreMusic/movie performance (sounds aren't very accurate)Overall, if you play twitch shooters, this is a good product at a good price. If you use your headphones for a wider range of activities, quadruple your budget for something higher quality."
5,This book is awesome,"This book is anautobyogryiffy of a young girl. This book is really good because it is from the eyes of a child. It made me even more into the books, because it is what it might of been like for me. The girl's father was a rabbi in Holland. The girl's mom & dad got her Grandmothers out of Germany so they could try to sevive together.In 1943 they were taken to Westerbork (in Holland) and then to the famous Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. (in Germany) She satyed for two years. She survived but her father and grandmothers did not. The book tells about her life after World War II. In England, New York, and Chicogo were she stayes with reletives and overcomes the tragity of the war."
2,Bad choice!,"Wow,I just got into rc last year. This heli never performed well out of the box. I waited till I had some coaxial time before I tried the NRII. It just was too hard to trim out. The guys at Venom however were outstanding. Great customer service, just not a good heli!"
5,two gnarly string quartets from the land of tango,"Alberto Ginastera hadn't the curbside tonal appeal of contemporaries like Gorecki. But his music is full of the stompdancing rhythms of the Pampas and wild country-fiddler adventures in sound. The first quartet is an early piece; it shows him getting his musical groove. The second approaches the heights of his greatest work. Performances austere, but precise."
4,excellent value,"This is an excellent value [...]. The Slovak Philharmonic is quite good. Recording quality is very good. Many of these Suppe' pieces are hard to find. It you like the composer, you will like this recording. Suppe' wrote many operettas and Slovak Philharmonic has recorded several volumes of the Suppe' overtures. I plan to purchase more in the series."
3,Okay...,"This book provides nice color pictures with a fair variety. However, I found that some of the values seem inaccurate, usually too high."
4,Does what it says...,"Very simple to use and certainly affordable, this switcher is small enough to slip in with any system and I don't see any image problems switching between and Xbox 360, a Blu Ray player and a DVD player."
4,King David: new perspectives,"Joseph Heller's funny, lively retelling of King David's autobiography gives us recognizeably the same character as the hero of I and II Samuel: passionate, powerful, crafty and with an incredible blind spot when it came to managing his family. I thought readers interested in learning about alternative recent historical understandings of King David could try Silberman and Finkelstein's ""The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts."" David was a real person, but according to this work, not the ruler of a united kingdom. Or, to use the language of Heller's book, he did not even turn a kingdom the size of Vermont into an empire the size of Maine."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SILVERWARE!!!,All of the previous reviews are true! This silverware is horrible and I dont know why Target is even still selling it. I was lucky enough that Target where I live was very cooperative in letting me return the set even though I had thrown away the packaging. The silver ware was tarnished and discolored after only one wash!!! The packaging says dishwasher safe but this is not the case apparently! It's too bad because the pattern and design was very nice! My advice check the reviews on the Target site or epinions.com to find a nice set of silverware. Some are in the same price range. You dont have to spend a fortune!
2,disappointed...,"I loved this design, so I asked for the set as a present. Unfortunately, it did have spots of rust and tarnish pretty quickly, which I've never really seen other stainless steel silverware do. Despite the obvious flaw, I still think they're attractive, but it's just not a lasting, quality item."
1,Boring at best!!!,"Boring game... I don't know what fun anyone could get from this game. You have to set up your character with certain characteristics or you can't get him/her to do anything; and then it is difficult to get anything done. The most frustrating part was trying to the the character to do some activity that would get them to advance and they shake their head saing they are not in the mood. You can't ever get started doing anything for having to coninuously go to the bathroom and before you know it you it's time to sleep, and you fall down where ever you are. The characters constant whining is very annoying. I wouldn't buy it."
2,NOT,Get Sims Bustin Out. It's the same thing but has better graphics and places to go. This version gets old fast. The censorship is one rediculous huge square that covers most of their entire body. The graphics and skins are poor.Get Bustin' Out instead.
4,A Primer of Ecclesiastical Latin,"I needed refresher after being away from the language for many years.This primer met the bill. Very good on cases, tenses, moods etc. Will help mein translating some parts of my old "" Missale Romanum"". I would recommendthis text to those willing to go back in time to translate old Churchdocuments."
4,The Best Game!,One of the best games.The graphics are GREAT!Unlike Max Payne you can use slow motion when you want to.You don't have to dive like in Max Payne to use slow motion.Tons of weapons to use.Pick from 2 characters.Levels arent all the same for both of them.They swear not to often.You even get to drive a car or sit shotgun.SO this is a MUST get game!
3,Only good at a glance,"This was one my most anticipated games of 03 and unfortunately doesn't end up on my top ten. I bought it expecting a fun blow up ride through the machine world of the Matrix with it's fancy fx and bullet-time. It has all that, and at first the game is smooth with pretty good graphics, but overtime it lagged. The same thing with the shooting and kicking and punching and every level lasts about 2 minutes before reaching a save point. There's actually one level (I can't believe it's considered one) where you walk three steps and it ends. I am a Matrix fan, but this was somewhat of a dissapointment. The cutscenes are really good and have potential, but for almost copying The Matrix Reloaded they could have included the main characters (Neo, Trinity, Morpheous). The hacking program is somewhat of interest but it is somewhat pointless. It takes around 4-5 hours to beat and once you finish, you'll want to shelve it."
4,Wow I am Impressed,"I thought this game would be a bunch of bull until I played it at my cousins.This game is so cool but you cant be Neo or Trinity or someone. It still is cool, it feels like you are in the game. You can do something called Focus which puts you in slow motion. It lets you walk up the walls, do special moves that are unbelievebly incredibly painful, and more!!! You can beat the crud out of the guys and everything. I am saving up for this game."
1,"terrible gameplay, weak storyline","I played this game hoping to see cool cut sequences and I did see cut sequences, but nothing cool. I felt bad that I had paid $ to view an ad for Matrix 3. I felt that the gameplay was not only weak but also boring. It was exceptionally easy.The only good thing about the game was that the CGI in the game matched the terrible CGI in the movie, so I felt like I was actually playing the movie.If you have to play this game to see what was not in the movie. Don't waste your time or money if you're interested in gameplay."
3,enter the matrix aint that good,it's ok ... the action is good and it's a nice long game ... some bits are hard and there are two characters to select from ... but the gameplay aint that good ... it ties in with the story from the film all right but some things dont make sence ... i say only buy it if you really love everything matrix or if you just like killing things
5,Unfortuently no one can be told how great this game is...,"...you'll have to play it for yourself.This game is a masterpiece.There are unlimited martial arts(and not only!)moves that you can perform,great,great,graphics,and a damn good storyine!There are many technical flaws in the game as well,like you will see some enemies stuck on the air and things like that,but those can be forgotten easily by the superiority of this masterpiece."
1,Don't buy this game,"This game started really great but there are so many glitches in it that tech support is overwhelmed. On the game that I bought, the screen blacks out on the same part of the game with each character. I talked to a support guy at Atari today and they said they are getting many complaints and they are trying to figure out what to do. I feel a massive recall coming on. Don't waste your money on the Beta version."
1,Enter The Matrix,"All the hype you heard about this game is just that - hype. It's an average game at best. The Tomb Raider games for PSONE are much more enjoyable than this game. The game play is stiff and it's hard to aim. The game locked up on me AT LEAST twice every hour, and no, it wasn't my PS2. This is the only game I've ever had lock up on me. I had to return it to the video store for a new one, which also locked up on me. I played with Ghost and solved this game in two days. In the end, it wasn't worth all the time and effort I put in. The best thing about this game is the Revolutions trailer at the end when you win."
1,"Gameplay is Great, but dark, long, boring levels ruin game","When I rented the game i expected to play a game that is right out of the movie{s}. Instead the game consists of this ""Ghost"" character{Trinnity's brother i gues}. The first 18 levels are fun, but a little short. Then after that you get stuck in a HUGE sewer. It may not seem that bad but after about sewer level 4 you will get really tired of; protecting people that barely protect themselves,running around in a almost pitch black maze, and you can rarely use your Matrix ablities so you have to just go around shoting people{which doesn't brighten up the game at all}. To make matters worse the levels that follow make the game almost look even worse. It's my recommendation that you should not buy this game unless you like long dark levels, and fun short levels. The game is rentable though."
3,Max Payne was better,"Reminds a lot of Max Payne, but controls are not that good. You will be disoriented through the most of the game. First time an X-Box game crashed on me. It seems to be a case with all games published by Atari (Infogrames), huge potential at the beginning and spoiled game at the end. I hope Ubi Soft will do a better job."
2,cool but not nearly as cool as peaople say it is,"Ok Yeah this game looks great, Yeah it has good controls , yeah the moves and combos and slow motion stuf is all cool. BUT!!the fact that every level is the same thing over and over again is totally boring, all you do is beat up and kill cops over and over in each level, it gets a little old after a few hours of that. every once in a while you get to fight an agent, other than that its pretty much just beating cops up and shooting them.the game is WAY too easy as well, levels are too short and the story is not interesting. every once in while you get to drive a car around and get away from cops and you guessed it SHOOT them.this game is only entertaining for about the first few days, then it just gets repititious.Worth a rental but in my opinion not worth buying."
2,Very Disappointing,"As a Matrix fan myself, I was very eager to get this game. When it finally came out, I bought it immediately and was extremely disappointed. The gameplay is boring and repetitive with very little detail and effort put into everything besides the characters. The game would have been great, except for the horrible graphics and gameplay. The story is not a porblem since it is that of the Matrix trilogy. The fighting is a button-smasher's dream, since you just need to smash the mouse to beat up 10 SWAT guys.With few missions that were actually fun, I can't say that this deserves more than 2 stars. I think the Wachowski brothers should stick to movies, not games.Gameplay - 1/5Graphics - 2/5Sound - 2/5Fighting - 1/5Story - 5/5"
2,Enter the Matrix,"Fast, furious.Stylish, powerful.The combat system here enthralled me,I spent over an hour on the first mission alone. I perfected every possible attack, shootdodge and cinematic trick imaginable. I couldn't beleive how much fun this was.Then the game itself kicked in. A post office. Could it get any more dull?How about sewers? filled with idiotic enemies who failed to seriously injure me even once.How about driving? What could be more fun than driving?Unfortunatly, in this world a car is an uncontrollable object derived of any attempt at physics.God I hate this game. Many levels later and the only thing keeping me going is the 52 I paid for the dammed thing.I'm bored. Only a couple of new moves have turned up, set peices have been laughable and I find the characters irritate me.I promise, avoiding this and buying any other hyped game will be good for you. At worst the others will be 3 stars or more.2 stars. Accompished combat, shoddy game."
4,great but a few flaws,overall this is my favorite game. you can do anything to bend the rules of the matrix. you can fight agents. Note you cannot complrtly kill a agent. just temperaley disable him. The flaws in this game are that if you enter a code on catching a plane level the game will freeze up. The levels are too dark you can barley see in some levels. overall this is a great game. you can if you beat hacking play muiltyplayer. it is well worth [the money]. bUY THIS GAME.
5,The most efficient way to sing in Russian,"I had no idea where to begin when I began working on my Rachmaninoff song. Then, I found this book and it did wonders for me. It is clearly the most complete and best organized guide to pronouncing Russian. I recommend it for anyone who is interested in singing in Russian. It is a little costly if you are only doing a few songs, but the trouble, frustration and anguish it will save you is well worth it."
3,Satisified for the price,"Even with a thick sock on these shoes were slightly too big, I should have ordered a 1/2 size smaller. I always wear the same size shoe but these seemed to run a little big. That made them a little uncomfortable. They aren't very giving either but for the price not a bad deal."
2,Exhaustingly Tiresome and Unbelievable,"Perhaps I've been ruined by mindless chick lit and other less intense forms of fiction, but I found this book to be both exhausting and tiresome. Over the years, I've read a lot of the legal thriller genre and usually find the attempts to solve the crime to be fascinating. In this case, while the author has done a great job of suspense, I just grew weary of it all.I don't believe people reading reviews want a synopsis of the book they're considering, so I won't go into detail about the storyline itself. Suffice to say that I found it a bit unbelievable that someone so sensitive to the victims and their family could also be so neglectful or insensitive to her own family, sometimes putting them at risk. Overall, I found this book to be a stretch of credibility, especially the ending.I won't say this isn't a well written book or that it might not be an interesting story, but I can't say I enjoyed reading it."
2,skip it,"There are too many really good books out there to waste time on this one. The growing trend with many mystery/crime writers to use a convoluted and rather implausable plot to build suspense. This is not a particularly well written book, filled with unlikeable characters who behave in a mindless manner."
4,Uneven,"The sophomore jinx hit Tonio K. hard. The follow-up to ""Life in the Food Chain"" is uneven. The four stars are earned, though, by the three over-the-top 80's-style ballads ""Sons of the Revolution"", ""Say Goodbye"" and ""Cinderella's Baby"", which are right up there with anything else he's recorded."
1,Obsolescence: the Dark Side's greatest weapon,"I run a LEGO League Robotics team and we were thrilled with the idea of ""Dark Side"" robots. Unfortunately, since a key part is no longer available, we are trolling e-Bay for parts. This title is a great concept, but it's very unpleasant that it's still being marketed when mission-critical components are not reliably available."
1,Terrible toy,"What a waste of money. The tracks won't stay together, and even if you can get them to stay together, the toy is too dangerous to use as the cars come flying off in all directions at high speed. Apparently there was a supplemental safety net added to the toy, but I never saw one in our box."
1,Dangerous!,I saw this thinking how neat it was until the car came flying out of the ball and hit my son at a very fast speed!!! Figuring it was a fluke we tried it again and again...Each and every time the car came zipping out dangerously. I would NEVER suggest this to anyone!!!!
1,I Used To Like Hot Wheels Tracks,"We've had hours of fun as the 3rd users of a basic Hot Wheels track set. So when I bought this toy for my son, I couldn't believe this Hot Wheels track can't attach to the rest of the track. It's stand alone and just goes round & round & round ... My son was bored after 6 goes but we're still pulling the old track out and reconnecting it all around the house in new ways every time"
2,"Fun, but a little dangerous","My 5 yr old got this for his birthday. He loves it, but from a parents point of view; it's very loud and the cars shoot out suddenly. The manufacturer has added a netting to put around it(not shown on the box)to help keep the cars in. The netting is very difficult to get on the track, and then the toy doesn't work as well."
2,UGH!,"I was very disapointed with this toy. My son received this toy for Christmas last year from Santa. This toy was difficult to put together, chintzy, and never seemed to work right. The cars go around and around and that is it. The children can not really play with it so it did not keep their interest for long at all. It seems to me that Mathcbox and Hot Wheels toys are very overrated. I HATE spending money on them because almost all of them that we have ever owned have fallen apart shortly after we bought them. This product was a let down-- from it's difficulty to put together to the fact that it takes up so much floor space, to the fact that it fell apart so quickly and was barely used. It also eats batteries. I would NOT recommend it."
1,Lots of Quotes - Not Much Else,"One would think that writing a ""book"" would require an author to make sure that their work contained a lot of their own writing. Not the case with Mark Levin. He has determined that the best way to write a book is to contain paragraph length (or longer) quotes and then to put forth a couple of lines of his own text to say that it proves his point. His ""Biographies"" of the fifteen justices are particularly poor. Not only for their content (or lack thereof by the author) but because they are not truly representative of the history of the court.Overall, I would say that this book is lacking in a host of areas and that most people could actually do a better job researching this position than Mark Levin. The actual writing of Mark Levin is generally weak and not well reasoned. One would be better served reading the actual books and papers quoted by Levin than this book."
5,well researched and though out,"Levin is very rare among current radio talk show hosts -- he has intellectualmeat to back up his views. He worked in the Reagan administration, and is apracticing lawyer. In a 280 page book, there are 45 pages of notes.Men in Black lays the case for what the judiciary is supposed to do according to the constitution. Levin's view is the surpreme court should read the words in the constitution and determine whether the cases how the cases before it maps into those words -- not to give their own interpretation of what ""should be there"".It talks about various Supreme court cases for over 200 years, (including Marbury v. Madison, Roe v. Wade, Bush v. Gore, California v. Bakke), dissects the decisionsand gives Mark's clear spin on them.Well worth reading."
5,MUST READ,"Today's deconstructionist mind set is destroying our societies framework. Imperialistic judges have caught onto our post-modern mind set and instead of interperating the constitution literally they are subjectively deciding what the law says ""to them"". This book chronicles outrageous court rulings and reminds us that judges are flawed human beings just like you and I."
5,A wake-up call to the citizens of this country,"Mark Levin brilliantly describes how the judiciary is usurping the power of the legislative and executive branches of government.He demonstrates how flawed court decisions have adversely affected the country in a way that the average person can understand.Mark demonstrates how the justices are human, they are not all knowing. As Mark points out in his book, some of them were racists and anti-semites. He documents how their personal biases affected their rulings and how that adversely affected the population.For those who want to learn more about how the courts affect our everyday life, this is the book to read. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and highly recommend it."
5,Unexpectedly Enjoyable,"As a person who leans more towards the science field, I thought that this book would be a tedious and complex discussion of law andstare decisis but it is actually very easy to get into, very well written and makes some compelling arguments. Mr. Levin definitely knows his stuff and makes a very good case for his beliefs indeed. A worthwhile read for sure!"
1,Just doesn't make sense,All these cries of activist judges and judges taking over the system. What political party is responsible for the most federal judicial appointments? Can you believe it's the same party this author supports?
1,Men In Black: How the Supreme Court Is Destroying America - no real analysis,Highly disappointing. More of a PR piece than anything else.
5,Holidays with Liberace,This DVD is a must have. It is great going down memory lane with Liberace at his best.
1,"MZB, like Generalissimo Francisco Franco, is still dead","Ms. Bradley's estate continues to churn out ""new"" works - even though she's been deceased for at least four (4) years. While the works she published while still among the living had incongruities and even contradictions at times, they still remained quite good, especially those after 1970. These new books are formulaic and just plain sad. The continued use of her name as an ""author"" is vile. While she welcomed others to play in the worlds she created I doubt she, like most people, would endure others putting words in her mouth.Please let her rest in peace. If you must continue to earn money off her creation don't lie about the source."
3,"good, but you can tell..","where bradley's input stopped, and Ross' started.. the characters are excellent, and I look forward to the rest of this trilogy, I only wish that bradley had been able to finish it herself."
5,sachets & pincushions,This is a great little book. I had been looking for a pincushion book to make some for my family.
3,Buy the Steelsound 5H without the USB sound card,"Pros: A retractable mic which is great for when you are not using it. Soft, comfortable pad around the speakers and still comfortable after a couple of hours using it. Great sound (without the USB sound card)Cons: The USB sound card is basically worthless since after 5 minutes with music, games, video, or whatever, the audio gets really staticky . When I used the mic with the USB sound card I got a static sound coming out over my voice and no matter how many time i adjusted the settings or the microphone itself, it never changed. If you don't like big headsets, then this probably wouldn't be the one you are looking for.Other: I suggest getting the Steelsound 5H headset product that doens't have the USB sound card, since the audio is staticky almost all the time but the headset itself is a great buy."
2,As Advertised,"Also contains a Thanksgiving episode, but it is as advertised: a christmas episode from the tv show. I was disappointed that the opening theme song & music were not from the original show. Guess they didnt want to pay the royality fees to use the original music, oh well."
2,A Little disappointed!!,"Although I did enjoy this somewhat, it was only with the help of an online hint site. I consider myself a fairly good mystery & puzzle solver but the clues in this and the way items were located, if not for those hints... I'd be pulling my hair out. Games are supposed to be fun not frustrating.With the hints I'd give this a 3.... without I'd give it a 1... hence my 2. Try Black Mirror instead!!"
1,Dont buy this game!![.],"When i bought this game, i ignored the reviews, thinking that it would turn out to be a good game. I was horribly wrong. This was one of the worst games ever made.For example, about 5 minuites into the game, you have to solve a puzzle before you can do anything else. I dont like puzzles a lot. Well, this game was full of them. Half of the things you were required to do turned out to have no point later in the game. To make my day of gaming even worse, I have come across 2 slider puzzles in the game so far, and i havent finished it yet. {im not anywhere near to finsihing it yet.}The cursor in the game is very confusing. I just kept clicking around the screen because i didnt understand any of the cursor symbuls. I have counted throughtout my half gaming experience, and noticed the cursor changes 6 times!If you are going to buy this game, get a walkthrough first, because i couldnt do half the stuff on my own without one."
3,Not THAT bad,"I found this game to be somewhat more interesting than the other reviewers gave it credit for. I agree that finding some of those teeny inventory items is next to impossible. Luckily, it was easy to find a walkthrough. However, I did find that this was relatively mindless entertainment. The only puzzle that required some thought was the Japanese puzzle, but not that difficult once you figure out the concept."
1,Only for begginers,"I bough this book looking for some useful insight in this area of astrology, but I only found comments for begginers. Not difficult to read, maybe useful for some, but too simple for anybody with some astrological knowledge. Do not buy it if you are looking for any deep thinking."
2,silly phrasing and over dubs,"I have heard some good stuff from Sun Kil Moon, and I really love Modest Mouse. However, I also have a live Mark Kozelek album that I cannot stomach. Unfortunately, this album reminded me of the later. I was hoping for stripped down songs in a more fundamental acoustic form, but these songs are ornamented with styling that often misses the point. They not only have a dulled edge in comparison to the original songs, but they sometimes make me feel embarrassed for the new interpretation."
5,Mark Kozelek is a great songwriter,and you really feel his music too. It sounds cheesy but its true. His approach is so earnest. Every album is great so I will go ahead and recommend all of them.
5,Good size pan,"Pan worked well for me with its design: the height fits perfect a 10-12 pound turkey or goose, the easy to handle removable grit works perfect and there is enough space in the bottom of the pan for plenty of gravy. I found nothing negative about the way the material cleans. Easy. The lit in itself makes a nice roasting dish as it is deep enough.The only negative issue for me: pan and lid are not suitable for induction cooktop. With most cookware I would like to see all manufacturer always specifically quote this. With a similar design, and price I would have chosen a roaster that works on induction. Otherwise I can only recommend this larger size roaster."
2,unlikable hero,"I have read everything Agela Knight has written and, except for The Forever Kiss, love her stuff! Unfortunately I really didn't like either the hero in this book. I'd recommend anything else Ms Knight has written!"
5,The Forever Kiss,This is a great book...something you can sink your teeth into. If you want a book that's hot and something you can't put down until the last page this is the book for you.
4,Great game for baseball fans!,"I will mention from the start that this is the only baseball game I have ever owned for the PS2...which is the only reason I've given it 4 stars. With that said, this is best baseball game I have played in a looong time. I chose this game to purchase after much consideration, comparisons, and research for the absolute best.The gameplay, music (awesome soundtrack!), and overall features make this baseball game an immediate favorite of mine. You know you cannot go wrong with an EA Sports game, seriously.I'm hooked on it...and I'd recommend it to any sports fan.From what I've heard...the only other baseball game that compares to this is Baseball 2K3 by Sega for PS2. You may want to look into that game and decide from there."
3,great game with a really big flaw,"this game is one of the funnest baseball games i have ever played. i love the method in which you pitch and hit, works better than any triple play game ever did. but i must say the whole reason i bought this game was so me and my friends i live with could play a franchise. so imagine my shock when i realized you can't play multiplayer seasons. so now this game has been reduced to us just playing exibitions against eachother, i have no desire to even play a season now. c'mon EA sports, tighten up. next season, make the franchise mode exactly like Madden, then you'll have yourselves a winner."
4,Good for the NEWBIES,"If you are just getting into Chuck Klosterman's writing, this is the book for you. I was given his previous book, SEX, DRUGS and COCOA PUFFS by a friend and found it to be one of the most entertaining and interesting books I had read in a long time. His insight into pop culture and his take on what is all means is fun and sometimes thought-provoking. I hadn't read any of his previous work, so this anthology of his previous work was a great way for me to catch up. I have since read KILLING YOURSELF, and am about to start FARGO. Enjoy!!!"
3,"OK, but a little over-rated!","I don't like negativity, but after reading all these rave reviews I felt I had to add my two cents. This isn't a bad CD, I think it's pretty good....but it's a little slow (if not to say boring at times). I would rather just hear the last two movements of Mompou's ""Suite Compostelana"" - like Scott Tennant recorded on ""Wild Mountain Thyme"". I think the main reason I'm writing this though is the comment another reviewer made about her version of Domeniconi's ""Koyunbaba"" making John Williams sound like a ""schoolboy""! I have both John Williams' ""The Guitarist"" and this CD----believe me, it isn't even close! John Williams version is absolutely incredible (as is his entire CD, a much better selection of repertoire) and makes Ms. Goni's version seem somewhat lame."
2,Poor Quality,"I purchased the TN 550 from Amazon due to the listed price below regular price from Staples and Office max. However the Toner didn't last as the other toners. I think the ink quality is poor and possibly these are used toners, pre-packed to resell. I am very disappointed with Amazon's produuct."
1,From Rage to Disgust,"This is the story of a poor African-American girl whose Caucasian features, physical beauty and mindless ambition allowed her to escape her social class and race to become a weather-girl in Chicago, runway model, successful celebrity hob-nobber, wife to corrupt Secretary of Defense William Cohen (her third husband), and a member of the power-elite...with whom she shares a complete lack of concern for the plight of the oppressed. She seems thrilled that she is now one of ""them"". The real woman behind the text, who alleges outrage at the way blacks are treated in this country and recounts her struggles with racism until she finally became white, is an Ivana Trump clone with some pseudo-leftist political rhetoric thrown on top. She is a plastic non-person who uses the power she acquired from her sheepish husband to engage in fits of self-aggrandizing onanism. But other than that, it's not a bad book."
2,Please give it up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!`,"i have read 3 of this authors books and i was really dissatisfied. it always ends stupid and i never want to finish it once i put it down. it seems as if i want to give him a chance but all the ones that i buy are garbage, you have some good parts but thats maybe 3 time s out the whole book.DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY $$$$$$$$$$$"
5,Italian Pyschedelica At Its Best,"This recording will take you back to the magical summer of incense and peppermints in no time at all. The early version of Le Orme -- five members, instead of three -- present the sweet sounds of the ""Summer of Love"" -- Italian Style. This version of Le Orme reminds me more of Traffic instead of ELP.Le Orme are masters at using their instruments and vocals to absolute perfection. Just listen to the second track of this CD, ""Ad Gloriam,"" where Le Orme uses instruments and background vocals to deliver a sweet, relaxing musical piece.This CD is excellent. The music is fantastic and the sound quality is terrific. This CD is a must, even if you do not understand Italian. Once you listen to this CD, you will get hooked on Le Orme music.I definitely recommend this CD."
4,Facile e chiaro,I find this book very well done easy to follow perfect for a beginner in photoshop like me
5,The best I've had,"This is a must have for saving space or just saving important data. I was changing computers. It keeps your information. I tried others and it didn't keep the data. This one keeps it safe. It is a tad complicatedl, but it is worth it. It keeps all kinds of data, unlike others that claim to. And I have lost some important data in the past!"
2,"Works nice, great price, but short life span","I bought a brand-new SanDisk Cruzer Mini about 2 months ago. Babied it, never dropped or anything. It started flaking out on me about a week ago, and failed completely last night. This is the second SanDisk Cruzer I've had in 5 months. I'd recommend looking elsewhere for your thumbdrive needs."
1,jhtripnc,This is the second one I have purchased. I got it for my daughter to transfer data from her desktop to her new laptop. She loves it. I use mine in the same way and have never had any problems. SanDisk makes an excellent product.
4,Excellent flash drive,This is my first experience with a flash drive and so far it has been all folks said it would be: excellent for storage and ease of use. I had no trouble hooking it up to my XP powered desktop but I could not get it to work with an older Windows 98 SE desktop despite downloading an advertised fix for Win98 computers. Instead I copied the files I wanted onto a CD-R and then used the XP computer to transfer them from CD to flash drive.
2,Reliable but sloooow,"Perhaps it is because it has 1 GB of storage to work with, but this drive is incredibly slow compared to my last drive (PNY Attache 128MB). I bought a 1GB mostly because I wanted to use Portable Apps, but this drive is so slow, that I have only had the patience to install a few of the apps I wanted.To give a sample:As I write this, I am extracting a 58MB zip file onto the drive.Here are some times:Local disk: 15 secondsPNY Attache: 30 secondsSanDisk Cruzer Mini: 5.5 minutesIf I had realized this during the return period, I would definitely have returned it. It is really unacceptably slow."
2,corrupted my powerpoint presentations,can't believe it did this after working on presentation for a week and didn't open on the day of..i was mad and embarrased. had to work with the pdf version
1,Bad aftertaste!,"I have to agree with some of the other reviews. My kids (3 and 6), kept putting up a fight when I tried these. Finally, I did my own taste test. Now I understand. Horrible aftertaste! Not sure why. Almost like they have gone bad."
2,"Good Intentions, but not a good learning book.","This is a very hard book to read. Not because of the subject, but because of the author's writing style and the fact that he introduces subjects and then referring them to the upcoming chapters.Overall, it covers the essential subjects, like the interaction between Java and XML and covers DOM, SAX, JAXP, but I wouldn't use this book as a learning tool. Might be a good reference.I would recommend XML Development With Java 2 by Michael Daconta, SAMS Publishing. To learn XML in detail, I would recommend the Professioanl XML, Wrox Publishing."
3,No XML Security,"This book doesn't have anything I couldn't find by just looking at samples on Sun's site.Most of all, it's missing security like XML Signatures, and XML encryption."
3,"Pleasant, but flakey","This book is great if you know something about XML and Java. For true beginners, well, it's a stretch. It also starts to show its age, and furthermore, its supporting website - both on the author's web server and O'Reilly's own servers, is sketchy. You will rely on both to use the code mentioned in the book.Otherwise, it is just an unremarkable information piece about Java and XML."
2,Another poorly written Computer Science book,"While not the worst computer book that I have read; this one straddles the fence quite nicely. The author seems to know his subject, but is a bit scatter brained in places. In some instances I have to re-read paragraphs as if it were code itself. It only gets two stars, because grammar seems to be as important as content. It's an okay book otherwise, but the could have left out the xml primer, as it wasn't very meaningful. The overall content of the book is good, but nothing really seems to stand out here."
1,Awful,This was the worst book she has written! The plot was totally absurd and the written was dreadful. Save your money!
3,Gift for a Friend,"This book was on a list of birthday gifts for a young lady who loves romance novels.She was pleased and found it fascinating, in fact she even read the book during dinner. Children these days !"
1,"Ridiculous story, poor writing","I am so angry that I have paid for this book! On page 9, Sam has a fully stocked pantry, fridge and freezer. On page 30 ""The fridge was bare but for water, beer, wine and two apples about to disintergrate"". She had just moved in. On page 10 Sam had a full view of her barren garden. On page 43, Sam looked out over a summer garden full of colorful flowers.These women decided in 10 minutes to leave their lives, not knowing who, what, they were getting involved with or where they were going. If they would ever be heard from again?I am not reading another page of this book.I have just added Fern Michaels to my ""Do Not Read Authors list."""
2,Another botched EA game on Xbox,"I've got a real bone to pick with EA. They just keep giving the Xbox wavw after wave of games with poor graphics and less features than on the PS2. Now, I am real close to dumping EA and begin playing Sega Sports games (which has some very sold games)PROS: 1. everything Triple Play wasnt2. some original spots (throw meter, franchise momentum, etc.)3. commentary is decentCONS: 1. lightyears behind the other baseball games2. yet another case of PS2 graphics syndrome3. Faces look pasted on4. controls are confusing5. there is no point to Pitching6. Franchise mode is all hype7. cannot control fielding at all8. impossible to get on base9. beginning trailer is a real turnoffFINAL VERDICT: do not waste your time and money on buying this game. If you think I'm wrong, rent it first, then well see whos saying, ""why didn't you tell me this game stunk?"""
1,Worst game ever,This game waz terrible i played it w/ my cousins the only reason i chose 1 * waz because that was the lowest it went on a scale from 1 to 5 i give it -3. in the game you can't aim because it automaticly hits your opponents. IT takes forever and is so boring. in conclusion boooooooooooooooooooo.
4,Love it!,"funny, my amazone account recommended it, and I kept ignoring it.I saw it at Toys R Us (...), and picked it up. I must mention I bought Red dead Revolver too(which I was really excited about). My friend and I ended up not putting this game down, and never touching Red Dead. It is the ultimate Red Dawn video game experience. The graphics are good, the music is really good, and the gameplay is just all around fun. I live in brooklyn, so the fact that it takes place there is even more amusing. Although we don't have a problem with Russians here.Anyways, do yourself a favor. Get it. It's my new favorite game on the xbox as of now."
4,Good Metal,"Let me start off by saying that this DevilDriver album is good, but not great. Everyone knows that Dez might not write the greatest lyrics, but the lyrics for ""Last Kind Words"" are definitely an improvement from their previous CD's which I will listen to once in a blue moon. Most of the songs are decently paced with heavy riffs, fast drumming, solos and no breakdowns and very few tempo changes. As someone mentioned previously, there are some deep dark grungy feeling songs and also there are some songs that in my opinion seem to be fillers. I skip over them because they don't appeal to me, though they are tolerable and sometimes I won't skip over them. This band puts on a great live show and I can't wait to hear more from them in the future."
3,Its okay. . .,"I have heard mucch better JE albums. As a matter of fact all of their other albums top this one. It kind of seems to me they were just trying too hard with this one. They are a talented group it should be effortless. Its an ok album non the thess. I true fan would buy it anyway just for support but, otherwise you can really take it or leave it."
2,Falls Short..,Unfortunately Jagged Edge didn't come hard on this album. This is the worst album of the bunch. The lead singer has a voice that sticks out and most of the songs on this album don't express that. He has the voice to sing more powerful songs. Another thing is the topics on their songs seem to be juvenile. The continue to talk about getting girls cause they're pimps. I think its time these grown men now realize their older and sing songs that mean something.
5,Great Product,"The conte crayons came on time (which was great, because the last time I tried to order conte crayons they didn't come at all). Great quality. Color's beautiful. The only thing I think is worth mentioning is that both crayons came broken, which doesn't matter to me, but it's just fyi."
3,Piikani Blackfeet : A Culture Under Siege,"Ummm, well I didn't read the book, and that's why I gave it 3 stars because I dont really know how, the book is, but if you start a book on the wrong foot that's not, well a good start. Well, I think, I am pretty sure of the tribe this person is talking about. It is the tribe that I am from. ACTUALLY, It's a branch of the Blackfeet. The Correct way of spelling this is ""Pikuni."" It was spelled ""Piikani."" Thank u"
4,Very Nice!,"This enclosure is well made, accommodates an AC power outlet, is reasonably priced, and is very easy to install. All the hardware needed to install it is included in the box. I did not see a hinged cover available for this enclosure or I would have given it five stars."
2,If its new why open the box?,"I got my AAA Energizers from these guys, it came faster than expected delivery arrival which is a plus, but when I read this product, it said it was brand new. So, Im pretty sure brand new means it hasn't been opened, well when I got mine, it's been opened. So did you just give me old batteries, and sell it as new ones? I'll never know i guess until after a couple months if they die right away, i know why. You mine as well go to the store and buy these because they are just about the same price at my local Walmart, except you don't wait a week to get them and you know they are brand new and haven't been opened. Thanks I guess for the possibly 'used' batteries. Who knows?! Next time don't open it and i'll give ya a positive review."
3,Epson Printers & Ink,"I've got a CX4800 - great scanner, built in USB and memory card readers. But I don't do a lot of printing so the cartridges start to dry or get clogged, not sure. I wind up running the cleaning utility periodically which is a major hassle. I have an HP with similiar features at work, no problems. Probably won't buy an Epson again."
5,Epson printer cartridges,"This is a brand new, OEM product, so it works great with the printer I have. Print quality is consistently excellent. Definitely the way to go."
1,Don't Buy from e2802r,"I ordered the Epson Black Ink Cartridge - T060120, form e2802r. Don't Buy this product. What I received was a compatiable ink cartridge replacement, xp-60. They advertised the OEM with pictures and the original T060120 logo. They will replace the original and send you compatiables.Would not recommend store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,I have brought Epson products for years and have always had good luck with them.,Epson ink's work much better then buying the ones that are really cheap. There ink has very bright colors and never runs. I use only Epson's ink nothing else.
3,Good price,The product came on time. Cheaper to get it on amazon. It is $30 in stores. One problem ink finishes quickly.
1,Low Ink,"In the past 6 weeks I have purchased two of these ink cartridges (only one on Amazon), both resulting in major disappointment. I replaced one black ink cartridge after printing between 30-35 pages and here I sit with another empty ink cartridge after printing about the same amount of pages. I'm not printing anything major either, just coupons. After spending close to $20 on each cartridge, the per page cost is more than $.65. This is ridiculous! Epson is ripping us off at these per page rates. I'm ready to purchase a new printer and I can guarantee it won't be an Epson!"
5,The best Inks,My Epson Printer required that I use the recommended Epson Inks for my Photo Stylist printer. They are the best. I tried the refill products in the past and they created a big mess inside the printer so I will NEVER use anything but the recommended Epson high quality recommended inks.
1,If you want economy you've got to pay for it,It's easy to understand why my Epson Stylus C88 printer was so cheap. The reason is because this single small black ink cartridge for the C88 is over $20 with tax/shipping. Hello? Does anybody see the picture here?
4,Not for everybody,"Deborah Holland has a great set of pipes, no doubt about it. She also was 1/3 of the late ""Animal Logic"" (where Stewart Copeland, ex of The Police, and Stanley Clarke made up the other 2/3's). This album is not a pop or rock undertaking however, but is more of an intellectual journey through the music of the Great Depression. Deborah notes, rather frightenly, that much of what was written then could be applied now. For those who enjoy this type of musical study, Deborah's interpretations and sweet voice do succeed in bringing at least some of this rather melancholy material alive."
4,Best rally game ever!,"This is the best rally game game I've ever played! There are so many cars, HUGE trucks and motorcycles to choose from. And twelve awesome tracks to tear up!The awesome~Lots of vehicles~Very good single player~Replays~MultiplayerThe bad~Vehicles get damaged to quickly~Too short~Needs more action~Needs upgrades to carsNot the best game in the world. Anyway it's very good. Rank B."
5,freedom fighters,o.k anyone who has a game system BUY THIS GAME.Believe me thisis the best game of the year.It is a first person shooter and is worth EVERY PENNY
2,"Clunky interface, but interesting story","Interesting story, unique approach, but ultimately frustrating fight interface mars this game. As someone who loves GTA, Godfather and Mercenaries, I had high hopes for this game. But it is more oriented to turn-based strategy, as you have to order your minions into fights and spend more time commanding than running and gunning. And speaking of gunning, having to press the analog stick down to aim is klunky and slows down the action. I was excited to get this game, but the excitement wore off and became frustrated neglect after a couple of hours."
5,Great reading,"While somewhat dated now, it is still great reading for anyone interested in street or tour riding on a motorcycle."
3,"eh.....so,so!","I love tenchu, but this one was short, i was a bit dissapointed, but still fin to play."
3,violent and stupid,The game is really fun. Different from all the normal stealth games that are high tech. The gameplay isn't good and the graphics are not either. They give you stupid tips that don't help. The multiplayer is OK. Very violent. Very fun to sneak around on roof tops and stuff.
2,Dangerous for kids,"Got the guitar, but the store didnt send the Amp with it, so I am returning it. While I was checking for the amp, saw the guitar and notices how sharp the frets were. The jagged edges on the frets on the guitar neck are sure to cut a childs fingers. I am surprised someone is even allowed to sell that kind of stuff without looking at child safety first. I play the guitar and bass, and I cant picture anyone playing this instrument without cutting their fingers as the move their hands across the neck. Bad worksmanship on this. It did look cute for my son though. I'd hate for his first guitar experience to be painful and discourage him from playing more."
1,still not here,"I bought this product on Dec 10 and still I can not track this product, I don't know where it is or if it is on the way..."
5,NOT YOUR TYPICAL DRUG BOOK,I GIVE MR BANK HIS PROPS I HAVE READ MANY GANGSTA DRUG BOOKS BUT THIS ONE IS LIKE NO OTHER I LIKE YA STYLE IT'S CRAZY YOU HAD MY EYE THE WHOLE TIME I BROUGHT THE BOOKHUSTLER IN HOPE TO GET A GOOD READ BUT THAT MESS WAS GARBAGE CAUGHT SLIPPEN KEPT IT STREET AND GULLY I USUALLY JUST BUY THE BOOK BY THE COVER BUT THIS HAD ME HOOK I WILL BE LOOKING PUT FOR ALL Al-Saadiq Banks BOKS FOR NOW ON
5,CAUGHT EM' WHAT........,SLIPPIN! OMG if you haven't read anything by this author you are really missing out ---this has got to be one of the hottest authors out. Al-Saadiq is definitely hands down one of my favorite authors. Each book gets better and better. I will buy anything this man writes!
3,White WARM...,This was my first book by Sandra Brown. Perhaps I allowed the reviews and title to affect my expectations. I found the writing very predictable and -warm at best...
3,White Hot,"I love Sandra Brown Books. Her Books are such a great read!! However, I was not turning the pages as fast as I am used to with her other books like Envy, Switched. My opinion its a okay read, not one of my favorites!!!"
3,Tepid,"This book is well written and reasonably well plotted (it is, after all, authored by Sandra Brown, who is one of the best in the business), but the characters just never really catch fire. While they may be interesting, they simply weren't nuanced enough for the reader to care much what happens to them. The more villainous of the lot were too dark a shade of black with no intriguing grey side to them or even mildly redeeming qualities to keep you guessing about what they would do next. The so-called hero and heroine were basically boring, and there just didn't seem to be much emotional chemistry between them. And you can see the ending coming a mile away.That said, it's not a bad afternoon diversion, but if you are expecting SB at her stellar best, you may be disappointed."
5,This Book Is Smokin,This is the Best Sandra Brown ever. It starts out with the apparent suicide of Sayre's Brother Danny. Or Is it. This book has so many turns and twists but it is so suspenseful. You will try to finish in one night. The characters in this book is as fascinating as the plot itself. If you are looking for good reading material look no more.
3,Luke Warm.,"I was really anticipating this book. I was very excited about starting it. However, I could not get into it to save my life!Sayre was really irritating to me. She was so not likable to me that I really didn't want Beck to go after her. I did like Beck alot. He was handsome and even though he worked for the evil doers, he seemed to be a very kind person.I also figured out the ending way early in the book. That is not something I normally do, but I was able to with this one. It was pretty predictable."
4,Typical Sandra,I'm a huge Sandra Brown fan. I must say I'm getting tired of the firey redhead with a family vendetta who calls her father by his first name. Still a good book with the twists and turns.
