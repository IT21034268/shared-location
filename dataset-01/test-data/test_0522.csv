2,Need more honest and helpful reviews - Software can NOT import html,"I tried SiteSpinner. It is decent web editing software.I gave it only 2 stars because it has a major flaw - You can NOT import an existing HTML page or file into it. You can only cut and paste text and images individually from an existing web site into the SiteSpinner work-window. (This is also acknowledged in a FAQ on SiteSpinner's site.)That means means you can NOT start with an existing web page, regardless of how simple it is. You must create a new page almost from scratch."
5,Long before Rod Stewart did standards,"The more you listen to this cd, the more you realize how great it is. Before Rod and Barry did these songs Leon Russell tried, and I believe succeeded in wrapping himself around nearly all of them here. A great standout is the almost spiritual ""That Lucky Old Sun"" with just Leon and the piano. Contrary to the other reviews, I enjoyed the orchestra and can envision Leon with a philharmonic doing these standards."
4,Nice sign for the garage,"While I thought it would be painted on, the lettering is just stickers.Looks good in the garage! Also, the item is bigger than I thought it would be, which is nice!"
5,My favorite show of all time,"Paladin was the greatest. Absolutely my favorite show of all time.He was a man of peace. He didn't want to use force, but if he had to he would use as much force as necessary to bring peace.If it weren't for his code of ethics, he would be someone to avoid at all costs. If he ever turned to crime, he would be one of the most formidable of bandits, and probably a criminal mastermind. But he wanted the good from people.He enjoyed the finer rewards of society and culture, but he equally enjoyed the simple home cooked meal with regular folk. He courted the high society city ladies, but he was also appreciated the decency of women of the country.But if you were dishonest or lied to him, it didn't matter what class, race, or gender you were, and he would not hesitate to let you know how displeased he was with you.He was a man who loved wisdom and tried to protect the innocent, the downtrodden, the victims.And he was very good with a gun. Best not get on his bad side!"
4,Not a cult book,"I had this book as a child. My family was not particularly religious, but the stories are simple to understand. I got nothing out of it that was cultish in anyway. Regardless of how you feel about the organization that has promoted this book, the book itself is a good starting place for young children."
5,Must reccomend!,I truly like this show and I highly reccomend this episode because it tells everyone a little bit more about those behind the camera.
4,It works,"it works, it will keep an opened bottles of wine fresher longer. Not much else you can say about it."
1,Not an useful tool,"I bought this ""Vacu Wine Saver Gift Pack"" and attempted to use it with traditional bottles; i.e. Bordeaux, Burgendy, Rhine and more.I followed their instructions exactly as presented.In no instance did their special stoppers maintain a moderate vacuum for more than 24 hours.Save your money on this item- - -simply don't buy it"
4,what a great deal,Read about this item in the wine column of the Wall Street Journal. Gave many as hoiday gifts for those who don't finish a bottle of wine at a sitting. Have tried ours for up to three days of holding wine and its great. A perfect hostess gift and everyone should have one for themselves if you want to hold wine for a few days. Have't tried it for long term but still recommend it 100%. Very easy to use as well. You can't go wrong at the price.
2,My son's least favorite Bruder toy,The detailing on this toy is not up to par with the other Bruder toys. Plus the action of the scoop is not very smooth. It is a pretty basic toy. I don't think I would buy it again.
5,"Great, Great Fun!!!!!!",This is by far the coolest monopoly edition to date; and i've seen them all. The attention to detail is amazing. You won't regret this buy.
1,Horrible Cheap Perfume Smell,"I'm in my late thirties and was looking for a less expensive skin care regimen for my aging skin. I usually use Dermalogica. I tried Aveeno because I like/use the products they make for babies. Boy, was I disappointed! Although I liked the way the cream made my skin feel and look, the fragrance was completely overwhelming. I tried to get used to the smell, but it continued to give both my husband and me terrible headaches. Yuk! A perfectly good product ruined by a horrible fragrance! Do not buy this product if you are at all sensitive to smell!"
3,"ok product, not what I needed","I very ,much like Aveeno products. This one I was hoping helped me more, but sadly it did not. I like the smell, the texture and the feel as I put it on, but, after a few days of use, I started noticing that my skin was drying and looked as it was peeling. So, while I like lots of things about this product, I di not think it provides the level of moisture my skin needs. This does not mean it may not work on others, but not for me!"
4,satisfactory,"moisturizing & fragrance are meet my expected, and the pack is very environmental. I am using the product now, and expect its moisture in the coming dry Spring season."
5,An incredible journey and self realization...................,"Where to start?...........this is really hard, as the book started from the middle then out. Which was the only way to do it! This is the third book that I've read of Elizabeth Flock and I have enjoyed all of them.This story should be read by anyone who has had depression in their family. This will take you down the road from the patient's point of view, then brings you through the various trials and tribulations that he/she has gone through. So many ask how or why, this book will tell you not only the how, and why, but also the who. There are so many ways for a person to reach their breaking point, it's just a matter of time and circumstances.I really don't want to give away the story, but Isabelle's breakdown happened on live television. This is a MUST READ BOOK.............But Inside I'm Screaming."
2,"Alas, sequels are rarely as good as the original","As I really enjoyed the author's debut novel, ""The Last Dragonlord"", I eagerly looked forward to this next in what is sure to be a series of books. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. This sequel was strictly average. It has some interesting bits, and some exciting bits, but it never quite comes together. There is a lot of material that never really goes anywhere, and yet I still never got a good feel for the picture the author was painting. I think the worst part is that I really get the feeling that, somewhere inside ""Dragon and Phoenix"", there is a smaller, much better story struggling to get out."
4,Nice shed for the money,"Overall this shed was the right price and just what we were looking for to keep our two large garbage containers in. We did have to put a strap around the bottom doors to keep raccoons out, and now can only access our garbage containers from the top, where there is a great latch that you can even put a lock on.Pros: Easy for 2 persons to assemble, durable, heavy duty plastic, easy access to containers within, nice color, reasonable price.Cons: Front doors too easy for a raccoon to open, no latch on front doors, not properly aligned even on level ground."
4,Storage Shed,Delivered on time and easy to assemble. Meets all of our expectations. Lid design could be improved with a more secure snap-in in the back and a heavier arm to keep the lid open.All-in-all very good value for the price
2,SO-so Storage,This unit is ok. Easy to put together but the fit is average leaving a gap between the doors. When you open the lid it constantly pops off the hinges. I wouldn't buy another one.
5,Experience or Just a comment?,"I don't think it was appropriate for the person who had not actually purchased this product to comment or give this product one star rating. He or she had no personal experience and should not have given an opinion or ""one star"" which was the lowest rating given. To cancel her one star I have marked a 5 star. The net of the two should put this back to the center of 3 stars which is a rating given by those who actually bought the product."
1,"Not enough power, not worth the money.","Please, do not waste your time on this product. It is the biggest waste of money. I bought it after using professional potter's wheel in the studio I worked at, and did not expect for this toy to compare to the wheel's at the studio, so I was suprised at the speed the wheel went at with nothing on it, and with 2lbs on it. But the very minute I put the slightest pressure on the wheel to attempt to center the clay, the wheel came to complete stop. I tried for another hour with less and less clay, and the result was always the same. This is a complete gimmick and not worth a moment of your time."
5,Brings national attention to Kaua`i's most treasured story,"Merwin's poetic style touches upon Hawaiian chant and upon fine western literature. Put together, this recounting of the legend of Ko`olau the Leper and his loyal wife Pi`ilani may become a masterpiece of Hawaiian literature.Our Kaua`i kupuna, Frances Frazier, with whom Merwin consulted, first translated the story in 1973 and published it in 1987.""Merwin called me after reading my translation and told me how thrilled he had been with the story. We became good friends,"" says Frazier.""Simply marvelous,"" she calls the book, but at first a bit unusual for modern readers.""At first I was taken aback because there wasn't a bit of punctuation. I'd never seen anything like that,"" she says.Frazier says the fictionalized account of the historical event correctly weaves together the characters and events.Frazier's translation of ""Pi`ilani's Lament,"" an exquisite example of Hawaiian soliloquy, appears on the web."
2,"This is a paperback, not a hardcover.","Even though this item is identified as being a hardcover book, it is a paperback book. It is not a ""Little Golden Book,"" as in the picture, but rather part of the paperback ""Golden Book"" series. The ISBN number is correct, so the problem is that Amazon has the product mislabeled and has the wrong photo up."
5,French Pasta Tonight!,"First, we love Patricia Wells writing, and used her books Food Lover's Guide to France and Food Lover's Guide to Paris as bibles on our many trips across the border. Bought this one for Father's Day 2012, and he loves it! First, he read it as you would read a book, reading out recipe title and ingredients with enormous enthusiasm. Then, we hit the grocery store, because there are so many of her recipes from this book that he wants to try. Tonight - French Pasta, with red peppers. Yummm.Patricia Wells books are readable, down to earth, and the recipes are doable and delicious. She knows France, and she knows the flavors of French cooking, and makes it possible for us to do the same. She is today's Julia Childs, bringing French flavor into American kitchens, with less fuss."
5,Sooooo hilarious!!!,"I went to see Mystery Team after watching the guys of Derrick Comedy for years on youtube. I must say, I went in with very high expectations, and they blew them out of the water!! Such a funny film from beginning to end. The originality was great, and Mystery Team has it in spades. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone."
3,Not Glover's best work.,"Donald Glover is hilarious on Community; but there unfortunately just aren't that many laughs to be found here.I've since watched some of the Derrick Comedy YouTube videos and I can't say they are very good either. My best guess is that it may have to do more with the writing than anything else. I'm afraid the best I can rate this is a 3/5 for OK. It's a great concept, especially if you were a fan of The Three Investigators Mystery Series created by Robert Arthur, Jr. when you were growing up. Sadly, the jokes just aren't that funny and the situations just not that original."
5,Derrick does it again,"I have been a fan of Derrick Comedy for years and have watched all of their videos. I heard about Mystery Team a few months before it came out, but couldn't find it online anywhere or playing in theaters. I kind of gave up on seeing it but about a year later some of my friends found out that it was playing in Cambridge, MA. We went down to see it and met D.C. Pierson and Meggie McFadden. The movie was great, I almost pre-ordered it, which I never do. This is a great movie and I think anyone would enjoy it."
2,charlotte bronte and her sisters,"this book is bizarely scrambled and therefore very difficult to read. Headings and paragraphs are inserted were they don't belong. There are many spelling errors and icons instead of letters compose some words. Even without these technical problems the content of the book is very unstructured and disorganized with the assumption that the reader already knows a lot of the historical details of the Bronte sisters and their contemporaries. I really don't understand how this book could be published and why it's content is so scrambled. Please don't ""punish"" yourself by ordering this book"
3,OK - with reservations,"The lamp has a pleasant feel, positioning is easy thanks to the swing arm. Assembly was fairly simple - except that the package came with the wrong screws (too short). After a couple of unsuccesful telephone calls to the number provided, I decided to buy the screws at a local hardware store. Once mounted, the lamp functions well, but the ""on-off"" button is too large and awkward.All in all a functional, made in China, inexpensive item. Not bad, but not too good either..."
5,The tracks hot to death,The track is BLAZZZING and the whole group blessed the mic all crazzy the 1st three cats sound ill and they are hungry and this area has yet to hear some street cat's that will eventually have something to offer to the sorry rap industry the ark angel cat and butta as well as taj ma hall are the foundation.
5,Hot 2 Def,"Yo; last time this area was on the map was because of Ruff Ryders. Give them they props, but now there's some new kids on the block. Beats is nuts, flows is ill, 'nuff said."
3,Too thin and flimsy...,I looked EVERYWHERE trying to find a metal cook set for my 3-year old daughter. I was excited to find this one--and VERY disappointed when it arrived. The metal is so thin that if my 18-month old falls on it (as I'm sure he will!) it will dent and bend and go right to the trash can. I would DEFINATELY not buy this brand again.
4,Nice set,"This is for my lil' 2yr old nephew along with some toy dishes, food & folding stove.It's a very cute set... but I wonder if the metal will get bent with banging &/or throwing??Anyways... It's very realistic looking & I think he'll enjoy them."
5,Great reference to understand the principles of ABA,"This book was the textbook which was prescribed for a graduate course that I took in Behavior Modification. It is an excellent reference book that clearly explains many of the prinicples on which ABA is based such as the different forms and schedules of reinforcement and the different methods of taking data. Although this book was prescribed for a course I completed well over a year ago, I have referreed to it on multiple occassions in the last year. This book should be in every ABA provider's bookcase."
4,As Good As It Gets,"When you watch these, whether you grew up with the series or are new to it, you really like the concept and the diversity of plots. The first season episodes are great as you got to know the characters, but the second season is more refined with a lot more detective work in my opinion. Each episode takes on a different angle, so you don't expect the ""same ol, same ol"". I think the quality of this dvd is better than the first season. Can't wait for the third season."
2,NOT the Complete Season + Edited,"How can a company that took so much time to bring Five-O fans a great Season One box set go horribly wrong with Season Two? First they don't include episode 16 ""Bored, She Hung Herself"". I've seen this episode. It was controversial at the time, and not one of the best produced, but it should be here. Then to put edited versions of some of the episodes (and not even list which ones they are), very sad. Why couldn't Paramont be consistant and give each seasons release the same great treatment fans want and expect? Sad indeed."
3,It helps to know one,"If you've never brushed up against fanboy or comic book culture this might leave you cold - a case study of arrested development in groups. Perhaps you've been among the true believers, though, like the ones who exchange wedding vows in Klingon. Then the stereotypes will all look very familiar. I swear, Hutch looks just like the guy behind the counter at the comic shop downtown.This has some amusing moments, like the tour guide of James T. Kirk's home town. That fan-built statue is a hoot, when you look at just how much cod there is in the codpiece. A few in-jokes helped too, like theTHX 1138-style guards' masks, or the Shatner cameo. Heartwarming moments didn't warm me, though, and one-joke movies wear thin fast. I'm glad I saw this once, but wouldn't be happy seeing it twice.-- wiredeweird"
4,"For ""Fanboys"" only, as expected","This was an enjoyable movie, definitely got a few laughs and I can appreciate where the writers are coming from. I am not sure of the replayability yet, but I hope to have a taste for it again. If this doesn't already look good to you, it probably won't be."
1,Not worth buyinh,I had been waiting the release of this movie sense I first heard about it back in 2006. It finally comes out and I am seriously disappointed. It might be because I know nothing about star wars and don't see a reason to purchase this movie other wise
2,Big let down,i bought this because the trailers for the movies made it look like it was gonna be wourth watching plus i figured since jay and silent bob was in the movie it was gonna be hilarious boy was i wrong i bout feel asleep watching this i had to make myself finish the movie this movie isn't worth buying in bluray format either jumps straight to the title screen and has just as much extras as a normal dvd
1,Di Gi Charat,Boy the Japanese have made animations for so long that they have ran out of inspiring and interesting material to write about.Prime example: Panyo Panyo Di Gi Charat.Don't waste your money this show is about nothing with cute characters that will attract people with short attention spans. My two year neice was bored of it.If a two year wouldn't watch it that is definitley a sign.
2,These shorts don't deserve the Curly Classics tape.,"The title CURLY CLASSICS isn't the right name for this short. None of these shorts can really be considered classics. The first three shorts are taken directly from the WHOOPS, I'M AN INDIAN tape. And the next two are taken from the A PAIN IN THE PULLMAN tape. The tape would be better if they included six episodes. I like ROCKIN' THRU THE ROCKIES and TERMITES OF 1938, but those aren't really classics. Why couldn't they include some REAL classics on this tape like A PLUMBING WE WILL GO, DISORDER IN THE COURT, YOU NATZY SPY, HOI POLLOI, HOW HIGH IS UP? I could go on forever, but my review calls for a thousand words or less. They do better on the second Curly Classics tape with MICRO-PHONIES, MEN IN BLACK, THREE LITTLE PIGSKINS, PUNCH DRUNKS, & WOMAN HATERS. Don't even bother to see WHOOPS, I'M AN INDIAN and GENTS WITHOUT CENTS."
3,funny but others are a lot better,i only saw a couple of these episodes and i agree that they aren't their best ones but i really love the stooges so i can watch them over and over again. i also was wondering if anyone knows the name of the episode where curly acts like a dog? i've been trying to find out which one it is for so long but i haven't been able to.
5,It's great,"Take my word, this is so fu**ing good! It's not a typical heavy metal album, more rock and very unique. Almost impossible to make comparation to other bands/albums. Get it!!"
5,Well written and informative,"Gray walks a fine line of telling the uninitiated what they need to know while also giving Bill fanatics fun tidbits and anecdotes about his everyday life. Gray's a good writer, too. So much so that at times, if you're not paying close attention, you might just miss where excerpts from Bill's best writing end and Gray's begin."
2,A slapdash piece on a fascinating figure,"This book was a major disappointment. While there are worthwhile excerpts from James's writings, there's really almost no book here at all - no organzation, poor copyediting, almost no new research, no original conclusions, no point.It's hard to believe a major publisher would consider this a book and not a collections of cut & paste excerpts and note card jottings."
2,Strictly for Newbies & Others Unfamiliar With James,"I loved Moneyball but this is not interesting enough to finish. This reminds me of a book about TV's Rifleman, Chuck Connors, who died before the author did any in-depth interviewing. I am not a current baseball fan so I only knew of James from reading Moneyball. This book is mostly a rehash of James' comments, some from about THIRTY years ago. Very little of this book is based on current interviews with James by the author.Now I am leery of trying ""Baseball by the Numbers."""
1,Stand Ourt L1 - Student text: Standards - Based English by Rob Jenkins,"Be careful when ordering this book.I ordered it and they sent the one with the wrong contains even the cover and the author was the same,they messed up !"
5,Best Shaver My Husband Ever Used!,"My husband is a hairy Italian guy, and I bought him this razor as a gift because his other rotary Norelco razor never seemed to give him a close shave. This razor is FANTASTIC! It shaves very close, and he has had no skin irritation. It is great for young guys with lots of hair. I highly recommend!!!!"
5,Works well,"Well, I typically use an electric razor for my chin only, as a blade will irritate it. I also like using gel rather than dry shaving. This shaver works great and is the closest shave I have gotten with an electric, and there is no irritation at all.I can't really speak to a full shave with this, but for my purposes it works great."
5,Worth it!,"I bought this camera for my 13 year old son to take with him to a snowboarding camp. It is perfect for him! We also wanted this since we lived on the coast and may want to take it in the boat and not have to worry about it getting wet.It is awesome for my son! Simple to use, he was able to figure it out instantly without looking at the directions. He was happy that it came with editing software (even though we haven't tried that yet). And we love that he will be able to load things on itunes for his ipod. I loved that the camera fits right in the palm of your hand.....a very natural feeling. The picture was clearer than I expected as well.We are extremely pleased with this product and I definitely recommend it for anyone that has preteens or teenagers and wants to let them use it w/o worrying about damage to fragile equipment.Awesome product! :)"
4,Don't forget to purchase the SDHC Memory Card,"I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. But the on-board memory hold only 13sec of video, so make sure you purchase memory... Or like me, you will wait a week for the memory to arrive. (Amazon as the best price on the memory that goes with this camera... the camera has an 8 gig max. I purchased: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P9ZBFA"
4,"Most were really interesting tales, but some were phbttt!","Personally, I thought that all of his ideas (not that I want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't read it) were cool. My favorite stories in it were: The Crystal Spheres, The Loom of Thessaly, and The River of Time. I am a definite fan of David Brin though, so maybe I'm slightly (just slightly) biased."
4,Good Leather Pouch for Razr,I purchased this from Amazon. This is a good leather pouch for Razr. The clip attahes firmly to the belt. It is pretty easy to take out the cell phone after a couple of practices. The only complain I have is the one I got is not exactly like what the picture shows.
2,Lukewarm Johnny,"I didn't like this book. I found it to be a confusing mishmash. There are too many characters and the story seems disjointed as it jumps from one female's prospective to another. The cover is goregeous, the blurbs are intriguing. The actual book was a let down. I took it back to the store four hours after I bought it."
2,"Hot Johnny, NOT!","I found it really hard to concentrate on this book, mainly because there were too many characters. Several times I had to go back to previous pages to try to understand what was going on. The first few chapters were great, but the story got dull and repetitive after a while. Some characters did not make sense at all and were totally out of place in the story. Most of the women were too complicated and it was nearly impossible to figure out at times how they fitted into Johnny's life. It seemed that everyone was related and at the end the reader is left thinking that the whole story is one big messed-up incest drama. The characters jump back and forth in time and it's hard to keep up with them. Sometimes it's a good thing that every character gets to tell their side of the story because they are all a piece of a puzzle, but in Hot Johnny all the women were pieces of different puzzles and they never came together."
5,tight Jam from MJ: King Of Music,One of the tightest Jams off the Bad Project. I dug the synth Horns and the chorus. Michael Jackson nailed the vocals big time and the urgency of this jam is still felt to this day. this is a jam that I still get hyped for everytime I play. Props always to the King of Music.
5,Fantastic,"One of the best ever! A real classic scent. Makes shaving a real pleasure. I also recommend the round glycerin soap as a pre-shave. It has a great soft citrus scent that blends nicely with the shaving cream. Badger brush recommended!!!!!Musgo's regular bar soap has a fresh and soft herb scent that doesn't ""scare"" the world and rinses clean!Once done I use a no-scent balm or skin moisturizer. No cologne or after shave! I just like the soft classic scent these three leave on!"
1,huge disappointment,"I expected alot from Jack Black and Nicole Kidman, but this has got to be each of their worst movies. It had some depth, but that depth was not played on correctly at all or in any type of productive or entertaining way. Little to no music, no development of characters or story, and straight boring. The only thing I did like was the big tree in the back yard and the role it played."
4,"Nicole, great as always!","This was a very good movie, these actresses Nicole and Jennifer Jason Leigh with Jack Black! I loved every minute of it."
1,"Even the word ""pointless"" has a point in it.","Dear Hollywood,I would like to make a movie that is completely pretentious, masturbatory, and trying to hard- but Margot at the Wedding beat me to it."
1,majority agreement,I was assigned this book in a college English course at the University of Chicago. The book is so boring that almost the entire class mutinied and stopped reading it halfway through. The professor conceded and dropped it from the syllabus.
2,Close up,"What could have been a marvelous video for ballet lovers is fatally flawed. The ballerina is fine but 40% of the video is spent looking at her face and some of that in her ear. We see flashes of costume, elbow, hand but few full body, which in dance is after all the whole purpose. Whirling boy bodies give us no idea whether they can dance at all. The movie behaves like a dear aunt's home video. Toobad"
4,Well-made and fashionable knee sock,"The sock seems well-made, and goes slightly over my knee, but it settles just under my knee after an hour of wear, which is perfect. I am 5'3"", btw. I love the pattern. What more could you ask for in a sock?"
5,teacher,not thin. very comfortable. feel n look great with my boots or sneakers. wore all day to work n loved them. I am older n no tired calves.
2,Personally I wasn't impressed.,"I'm actually disappointed in this grinder. I thought Braun would put out a better product. It seems ""flimsy"" and the ground coffee sticks horribly if you like a fine or espresso type grind."
3,Brittle Cover,Would be 5 star if the plastic cover stood up to grinding coffee beans and hawthorne berries. I drank a lot of plastic chips before I realized that the bottom edge of the cup was being eaten away. Excellent motor and blades. I do not recommend this product.
4,"Loud, but works great!","Unfortunately, as other people have said, this is a very loud grinder. I use it only as a coffee grinder, it works wonderfully, and is easy to clean. However, as I live in a small apartment with relatively thin walls, grinding coffee early in the morning is out of the question. If noise is going to be an issue for you, I highly recommend looking for a different grinder."
4,Good Book,This is a great way to work through the 12 Steps either alone of with a partner or a group.
5,I love this product,"the Braun M880 Multimix is my favorite tool in the kitchen. I have worn out 2 sets, and am searching for a site to buy another one. I have been looking for two months without luck. It is so handy, I haven't found anything that the chopper can't chop. I like the blender for pureeing tomatoes for canning soup. I have a stand mixer, but find that I always reach for my Braun to whip up mashed potatoes and cookies, and cakes. It is a great product.I don't want to purchase any other brand or type, so I will add this to my wish list and hope that it will soon be available again."
4,Very nice for regular household use,"its a very nice product, also very inexpensive. I used the mixer and the processor the most. its great for daily usage around the kitchen."
2,I agree with others: Great while it lasts,"While it works, I love this mixer. Feels sturdy, balanced, and doesn't have the little exhaust grill that other handmixers have the collect goo. Except from bread dough, I barely use my stand mixer. The chopper is great for small jobs & salad dressings. The blender I use all the time to puree baby food or soup instead of waiting for it to cool, and getting my blender dirty.But my SECOND multimix has just stopped working on the 2 low speeds. Each mixer lasted 3-4 years. I'm so disappointed that a Braun appliance has failed not once, but twice. And from the other reviews I've read, this is obviously a common problem that they should have fixed by now!!"
4,Love it so far,Love the power and that the low speed is low enough to avoid spatter. I've used everything except the dough hooks in the couple of weeks I've owned it and have been pleased with the ease of use and performance of all components. I have a stand mixer as well and this unit is NOT a replacement for it's function but rather a simpler way to handle smaller jobs -- and it does exactly that beautifully.The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that I received a defective one prior to the one I now own. There was something loose rattling around inside the immersion blender. I don't know if this is a quality control issue or damage during shipping but the box was in good shape so that suggests quality control. Amazon took care of the replacement with no hassles and the second unit works great.
2,broke after few months,"The appliance is very handy, but it broke after a few months for no reason. It now only works on speed 3, which means that I cannot use it for cake mixes because the power is so high that it sends the batter splattering out of the bowl.I was disappointed that the product has lost function after only a few months."
1,defective,It worked for 30 seconds. I started making instant vanilla pudding & I shut it off to add more ingredients. Then it had no power & kept blowing the circuts and burnt the plug. All this the night before a party. I was pretty upset that I hadn't tried it out before I actually needed it.
3,Don't Like Speed Control,"Instead of a continuously variable speed control, the unit has three arbitrary setting. The speed of the lowest setting is too high and sometimes causes the contents to splash out of the mixing bowl.The accessories are nice to have."
2,Braun ain't what it was,"as others have written, works great for a year, then only speed 3 works. The mini food processor bowl cracked under that speed. Too bad one can't get in the thing to replace the switch easily.dawg!"
4,very user friendly,i have used bankable business plans and referred to those sections applicable to my needs and found it very user friendly
2,Sound quality not very good.,"The bass is pretty thin and the overall signal level is low, so I have to crank the stereo way up compared to normal radio listening levels. It was quite cheap compared to other similar products, but I'm wishing I'd spent a little more the get something better."
4,Cassette to Ipod auto player,"This works well for listening to books from your MP3 or Ipod if you have a car with a cassette player. It works for music too, but the tape player gives a hum. If you are a critical listener, that could be bothersome."
3,Keep the metal part warm otherwise it won't work,this product doesn't always work. I have discovered that you can't leave it in the car because it won't work. I bring it in the house and then I put it in the car audio while it is still room temperature. I think the metal makes contact better and so far it has worked. We shall see. Kee
1,Stopped Working,"This item started working perfectly with good quality sound.BUT this only lasted for 3 weeks. After 3 weeks without leaving my car radio (used it every day), it seems that some of the internal mechanisms have failed, so the radio starts changing between side 1 and 2 endlessly. In other words, the item is unusable, and I have tried it in 4 different radios to be sure that it is this adapter, all with the same effect.Stay away from this item!"
3,amazon xm auto cassette adapter,works great in cars. can be used in other cassettes by playing around with adjustments so the wire doesn't get in the way which will cause the cassette to reject. amazon purchase
5,"Great deal, works perfectly","Rather than buying some no-name version of this from an EBay merchant in hong kong, I decided to pay a few cents more and get this Belkin.It works perfectly. If you have a car without Bluetooth,band a stereo with a tape deck, this adaptor will allow you to play music from a mobile device.Highly recommended."
5,Works on corolla 1999 and ford van from 1998,It works perfect on both cars I love it! Cable is a little short but the quality is good. Good buy!
5,"Great Product, Price","I recently upgraded to premium Spotify and wanted to be able to listen it in my car with my iPhone. I tried one of the FM adapters, but it sucked. I constantly had to search for new stations, and if the phone wasn't right up next to the console, there was static.Honestly, I wasn't expecting much when I purchased the cassette adapter. For less than $6, I figured it was worth a try. Besides premium Spotify, this is one of the best purchases I've made in a long time:) It works perfectly! I did notice that there was some interference if the volume on my phone was turned up all the way. Turned it down a few notches, and it disappeared."
1,Cracks + pops =useless,"I was afraid that I was purchasing a poor product simply because it was so cheap. Indeed, I purchased a poor product! When using the tape, the rear speakers pop & crack continuously making the listening of music miserable.Also, the tape does not appear how it is listed. There is no text inscribed on the tape as seen in the picture. The XM logo is fake, lacking the TM, or R symbol in the bottom right corner of the logo. This product is clearly a counterfeit.I would definitely recommend not purchasing this product. It was a waste of money."
3,Dissappointed,As soon as i got it i tried it out and it only played on the left side. Not THAT bad but it is really annoying since i was expecting it to work fine but maybe i just got a bad one. I found out later that if I tuck the cord in the back and put the tape in upside down it works through both speakers but the sound is really quiet. I did send them an e-mail to get a replacement and hopefully that one works.
3,"Doesn't work for me, but could for you.","Adapter only played audio on the right side of my car for some reason. Tried everything. Speakers work fine, and old adapter worked fine that I bought at a store. Took a chance on this and failed, however customer service was very helpful with my refund and I have no complaints."
4,Works Great,"A nice deal for under $8.Works fine for iPod, MP3, etc. (""XM"" title is misleading.)The cord is a little thin.Had it 1 week...too early to comment on durability. No warranty info is provided with the product or on amazon."
3,Loud,This product is by no means spectacular or deserving of above a 3. Sound quality is average. The device itself makes a lot of noise when used....I'm not sure if I received a defective one or not but you can hear the spokes being turned and whatnot. Kinda annoying...but if you play your music loud enough it drowns it out. I don't think the seller packages it very well because I received it with some of the plastic already cracked off. Hit or a miss I suppose
1,GARBAGE,This item didn't work! There was a clicking noise in the tape player and the sound quality was horrible. The seller never responded to me. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
2,Bait and switch,"this is not a belkin adapter as advertised, its a Phillips. Be warned. Dont fall for the bait and switch like I did"
1,Belkin XM Auto Cassette Adapter for Apple Ipod/Iphone,I bought ths for my daughter as she got a new car to her. But it didnot have access to a CD player. What it did have was a cassete am/fm radio a weather band and a jack for herCassett adapter. My daughter and I was throughly disappointed. As their are no jobs in the family living on week to week. So this was a surpise for her new car and it broke within 2 and 1/2 weeks of purchasing it. I thought Belkin was alot better than that. You ought to be ashamed of yourself leading a 16 year old on thinking that she could have music in her new/used foreign top running car.
2,It worked for few days and then lot of noise started,"When I got this for my iphone 4 it worked very well for first couple of weeks and then i started hearing a lot of noise, one day i wasnt able to use it at all because the only thing that i use hearing was the noise but then next day it got better. So overall now a good product, if someone knows of a better auto cassette adapter then this let me know. I am ok to spend money but would like to have a nice adapter."
3,works ok,it has good pickup but the cassete player design interferes with the wire so it's hard to eject. a bluetooth fm transmitter would probably work better.
5,Great deal!,"I usually pay 30$ for the same product at radio shack so I'm really pleased with the price difference it also came extremely fast!!I'm very happy with this product, these things seem to break easily if&when this one does ill definetally go through this consumer again!!"
4,Works great!,"Pros:- It does not look cheap like most budget adapters are. It looks more decent than my other cassette adapters that cost 20$- Sounds good with my iPods.Cons:- It makes noticeable clicking sound while in the cassette player. (But not bad compared to the others).- I prefer a coiled cord. I had to cut the cord of my XM cassette adapter when it accidentally got stuck under the driver seat. The end served as a hook and I could not pull it out. A coiled cord retracts and hence much shorter, and less clutter. The one I am using now isCoby CA-747 Dual Position CD/MD/MP3 Cassette Adapter"
1,Bad!,This Cassette Adapter does dont work with my Apple I-touch and i am very dissapointed with being mislead into this product!
4,"Good quality, cheap price, not so great for iPad","Could just be the music device, but the tape doesn't work to well with the iPad at loud volumes. However, it works excellently at all volumes with all my other devices. Definitely recommend."
3,Not sure how well it works,"Purchased it because the earlier one made rattling noise. Somehow, this one makes the same noise too. Looks like my system has a problem. When it works, it worked fine (but that was only on 2 occasions when the car was warm enough)."
3,Does its job...,"I bought this adapter to replace my Griffin cassette adapter... I bought that one for over $10 at Target. After having it for almost a year the wiring just gave out. The sound quality was great, but the cassette made such LOUD noise! I would have to raise the volume just to drown-out all the mechanical sounds.So I bought this XM one because the price was cheap and after having it for a week I can say it was well worth it and I'm buying another one. It makes NO NOISE while in my tape deck... But I do have ONE problem.If I turn up the volume on my iPhone--all the way--and keep my radio one low while doing so--as I raise my radio volume there's a screeching sound so I have to turn down the volume on my phone. I never had this problem with the Griffin adapter, but no matter--this is still worth it for the price!I recommend it.(FYI: I purchased this from Amazon because I found this exact same one at Target for over $9, but used the barcode scanner and found it for this price--$5.99)"
2,"Started Good, Lasted a Month","After about a month, this became a useless piece of plastic, may work longer if not in a car, but even then you'll have to be real careful with it. Would not buy again."
4,its pretty good,"good product for how cheap it is, better than the $20 ones in town, sound quality could be better, but overall it's a good adapter."
1,broke when recived,a simple item that should work flawlessly the connector was loose right out of the package couldnt use at all. didnt even bother with the exchage lose more money on s/h
5,works!,Fast shipping and the best sound quality on one of these tape to audio jack converters I've found so far. Doesn't make that annoying clicking sound that most of these do. Would recommend!
3,Shipping cost is more than its worth. I didn't look close enough.,"Just like the title says, I paid too much in shipping for this item. I saw the great deal and didn't realize that with shipping I was paying more than it was worth. Live & learn."
3,It works well.,"I did not expect that it will work that well for such a price. However, I felt a bit cheated as the picture on the site has a XM logo on the adapter. I related the XM as a reliable brand name. The adapter I got has no name on it. It is just bare bone OEM. Otherwise, it works well. The noise is sure something that someone with a sensitive ears should concern about."
2,Poor quality sound,Sure. It works. But it sounds pretty bad. And it's not the source. The previous cassette adapter I used sounded much better (cable finally died). I bought two. Both crappy sound.
4,Really Fast Delivery,Merchandise was delivered in two days.. So far so good! The item seems to work flawlessly. I've only had it two days. Let's hope it continues to work like a charm. Thanks SRS
3,It Didn't work,What a waste of money. It might be my stereo that is a bit on the old side though. It was dirt cheap so I guess it is not a big loss.
2,"Great sound, AWFUL build quality","I bought one of these about 6 months ago. I had tried other cassette adapters, and I must say, the sound quality on this thing was much better than most. HOWEVER, it broke after 3 weeks. I contacted the seller and they sent me another one for free. That one lasted 2-3 months and then the absolute joke of a cord on this thing frayed and broke. At that point, I gave up and moved on. Yes, the sound quality is good and you'll love it at first, but trust me, I've had two of these and they're just poorly made. Why not just make one with a thicker, more durable cord?! Some companies will cut corners wherever possible, I guess. Unbelievable. Avoid."
1,Unusable - Distortion,I'd recommend a different brand. This one makes it sound like your speakers are blown (and no - they're not). Playing direct from the CD sounds great. Playing the iPhone into Bose QuiteComfort 15s sounds great so I know it's not the music file on the phone. - it's just when I try to play through the cassette that it sounds horrible.
1,Get what ypu pay for- crap,I bought this for a gift and was so disappointed when I heard how terrible of quality it was. It kept cutting out and was fuzzy. Stay away from this useless rip off. It is a waste of your money!
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, YOU WILL REGRET IT","This thing keeps having to change sides every 20 seconds. Bad sound quality, broke my old car's tape player. Keeps ejecting itself from other tape players, I've tried using it several different times. It worked okay for about two weeks...Just don't buy this one."
2,strange,"Ms Battle has a wondeful voice and a exquesite tecnique, but when she opens her mouth it sounds like she is losing somehitng: the feeling of music."
2,Not leak proof and dust proof!,I have had this for 6 months now and tried everything to make it quit leaking to no avail. Also the dust just pours into this thing like crazy. One thing that it does do is lock and allow you to carry a larger load. But if you need to keep things dry and clean...forget it. Real disappointing...this thing leaks at the front and all along the sides.Good luck...
2,I Can Tell You Why I didn't like this book,"This book is a major disappointment for several reasons. First of all, the author spends an inordinate amount of time discussing the Eagles' managers and record company executives. He spends more time with Irving Azoff and David Geffen than with Don Felder or Tim Schmidt! Secondly, nearly one-third of this book is given over to a too-extensive discography of the credits of every single recording every Eagle ever played on - maybe this deserves to be written up somewhere, but not here. Lastly, he fails to give the reader a sense of the Eagles' place in music history and of their contributions to the music scenes of the '70s and '80s. Why did the Eagles move away from country-rock? Why did Henley's solo career thrive while Frey's failed? Why do so many of today's young country artists cite the Eagles as a major influence? What exactly goes on in Joe Walsh's head? NONE of these issues are explored. ""Take it easy"" on your wallet and don't buy this!"
2,Wait for the Paperback,"I haven't seen this much mindless ""filler"" since I helped grade high-school term papers. One-third of this barely 300 page book is clotted with unnecessary (and incredibly boring) lists of Eagles albums, solo efforts, guest appearances on other albums, zzz zzz zzz. If Mr. Eliot did manage to interview the reclusive Mr. Henley, he didn't get any earth-shattering information out of him. It's all been said before (ad nauseum) in other interviews. In fact, I got a rather creepy feeling that, although unauthorized, this book was heavily censored by someone in Henley's camp. Perhaps that was the reason behind the year-long delay in releasing the book. If you're looking for salacious, behind-the-scenes dirt you won't find it here. If you want to read about clever, talented, annoyingly childish ego-maniacs, then you might like this book. But definitely wait for the paperback."
1,Henley's Limit!,"This book was very pro Henley. He won't have to write an autobiography, it's already written. I just got done reading Don Felder's book, Heaven and Hell. I would recommend Felder's book. Felder wasn't there at the beginning, so you're not going to get the early story of the Eagles, however he gives very good accounts of what happened to Bernie and Randy."
3,"Confusing, but yet intriguing","I read this book in remarkably little time, mainly because it isn't exactly heavy on pages... This book was like a vacation which has been planned to include EVERYTHING in as short a time as possible. Sometimes I wondered if there was something wrong with my copy of the book, as Niven dashed from one idea to another, and then yet ANOTHER! Still, I found the book to be intriguing, and some of the quotes included (such as Jerry Pournelle's about dreaming that he would one day see man land on the moon, but never imagining he'd see the last) give the book a nice weight and feel. I was a little bemused by the supposed link to Terry Pratchett's work. This book never felt like funny fantasy, but simply a non-too serious romp into fantastic science fiction. Well worth seeing once released in the paperback edition."
4,Niven on it's best,"If you like Niven, this is one of the books to go for. The way in this books other creatures are described is Niven at his best."
1,Disappointing,"After 60 pages, I closed it and put it on the shelf. A waste of time and money. Although I loved Ringworld, The Integral Trees, etc., stories about time travel should be left to someone like Keith Laumer, the best IMHO."
1,Rainbow Mars,"I am a long time reader of Science Fiction who has enjoyed Larry Niven's works but Rainbow Mars was a severe disappointment. I found the book, particularly the dialog, confusing and rife with non sequiturs. It's almost as if Mr Niven had written a book twice as long and then went back and deleted every other line."
1,Another sad effort from Niven,"This is yet another in the increasingly long series of truly bad books from larry Niven. Why do I keep reading them? I'm a Niven fan from decades ago, and keep thinking that the next book will be a return to previous excellence, but this is another disappointment.The book has some typically fascinating ideas, and Niven is obviously having some fun interjecting raw fantasy and mythology into his science fiction. Unfortunately, it suffers terribly from very poor writing and development. Imagine my surprise also when I discovered the story ends at the books midpoint, and the rest is filled with short stories on the same subject.If there's one thing I've learned, it's that more people will give a good review to a bad book, than a bad review to a good book. Trust the reviews you read, you'll save money and time."
3,The Id needs ID...,"I jammed off the album, but it's a little hard to digest Macy Gray's voice and style musically. She is wonderful as a poet, and should keep writing, but I don't think people will be jammin of this album in years to come...I admire Gray as an artist and see lots of talent in her, but this particualar album wasn't hitting me the right way."
1,Macy Records a Disgracey,"I will preface this review by saying I own Macy's first CD ""On How Life Is"" and it was a good CD. But I noticed that it did not prove to have a very long shelf life for me. But for some reason I purchased her sophomore offering The ID without having heard even a snippet of a song from it. I gotta say. WOW! WHAT A DISSAPPOINTMENT! I have listened to the whole CD at least five times now and you know it is bad when you find yourself not looking forward to hearing even one song again. This is really bad. Her voice is terrible, unintelligible at times, cartoonish and gets more irritating than a chancre sore that lasts for too long. I wish I could give you one redeeming feature but I cannot. ...I shared it with several people at work and all of them returned it to me stating they could not finish it. To sum it up, this will be the FIRST CD that I will have ever taken to a place that buys used CD's..."
3,taste of the id,"Macy Gray is hardly an attractive star in today's music arena; and her sandpaper-coarse voice while unique, may actually sound irritating to some. But still, she debuted with an impressive first album that already mixed funk, soul, hip-hop and dance.Bringing this formula into her second album and adding rock and pop ainto the melting pot of hers, Macy showcases a second wonderful album of gems. The first single, Sweet Baby (an I Try follow-up of sorts), features the nice but understated harmonies of Erykah Badu. Seemingly inane songs like Relating To A Psychopath and Give Me ALl Ya Lovin' (Or I WIll Kil You) are actually fun and funky. But expect nothing radically different from Life.Overall the album delivers with some punch that is often lacking in many artists' followup. And this album has already topped the UK album charts. If you hate her, she's gonna be around for a while to stalk you."
4,Good Value!,"This is the best value for the money, though Viva is slightly higher quality. Soaks up spills fast without disintegrating!"
4,Fun Travel Reading,"If you like to read stories set in places where you are traveling (or would like to travel), this one is for you. Sure, it's not ""great literature"" writing. But the story is very engaging and becomes more so as you continue to read. I just ordered the sequel. And re: other reviewers I've seen who criticized her for leaving her ""children""... Her son and daughter were grown and out of the house already! Why shouldn't Marlena get married and go to Venice? This is a very readable book and will enhance the experience of anyone making plans to travel to Italy."
2,"Venice, as seen through the navel gazing of De Blasi.","I found this book ponderous and self absorbed. Unfortunately, so much written about Venice falls into the same category, so this is not the worst of the genre by far.The writer is obsessed with food. This is not, in and of itself, a bad thing, and the passages about local specialties and famed Rialto markets were interesting. But by the end, if I had to read one more line about The Stranger's ""blueberry"" eyes, I thought I would scream. Eyeballs should not be described as foodstuffs. Likewise, the endless obsession with finding Mongolian lamb for her wedding outfit was tedious beyond tolerance (perhaps it was the lamb part that kept her going).I see from other reviews that many found the book romantic, the ultimate fulfullment of a fantasy. Realists, be warned."
5,sensual and lush love story,"The main character of this book Marlena, a chef from St Louis, is visiting Venice for one of the many times she goes there. This time , a Venitian ,as she comes to call him, notices her and her life changes forever. This memoir tells of her life setting up house with the Venitian, her forays into the markets and her recipes and meals. De Blasi has lovely words to describe the scenes and the smells and the tastes as she explores Venice with her new husband. Some of the description may be over the top but Melena lives life that way."
4,So much richness,"The greatest appeal of this glittering memoir is the self-possession of its author. Here is a woman who understands herself well, and she shapes her story with great skill and aliveness. De Blasi paints many beautiful word picture for us, revealing the inner and outer richness of her lush mid-life adventure. She is equally articulate on the history of Venice, the psychology of love, and gourmet cooking. I wasn't riveted by every chapter, but A Thousand Days in Venice left me admiring De Blasi as a woman and a writer. I came away from this read with a renewed commitment to the romantic life and a wish in my heart for De Blasi's lasting happiness..."
4,"VMPL3b does not expand wide enough for 65"" (max 42"") Panasonic Plasma","Hello. best buy sold me a Sanus VMPL3b but it does not fit. the wall mount only expands to max 42"" and the mounts on our Panasonic 65"" Plasma TH-65PZ750U are at least 43.5"" apart. Not much I can do about the tv mounts/brackets since the screw holes are fixed. So be careful when the item description states this mount will fit a 65"" plasma, actually some descriptions state fits ""most"" 65"" plasma tv's."
4,loved it!,I bought this item for my two grandchildren who are 2 yrs (girl) and 3yrs (boy). They loved it and was entertained for hours with it. So fun to push the buttons and hear all of the sounds! The only negative was the oven door quickly stopped staying closed. Frustrating. But overall so glad I bought it for them!
3,My kid's love it,"My kids really love this kitchen, but as a parent tha cleans up all of the accesories I feel that there needs to bigger spaces for all of the dishes and fake food to go in. But other than that it is very functional, and a big hit with the kids."
4,Great Kitchen Wish We Had All The Pieces,"I purchased this item at the Toys R Us store in Columbia, MO. I had to wait for 30 min for the customer service girl to finally figure out that they had these in stock. I love this kitchen and did alot of research before we bought it. It was relativly easy to put together. NOW to the NEGATIVE! I did not get all 27 pieces with our set so now I have to figure out where to get the rest of the parts. I live 30 min. away from the store and I am not happy. Merry Christmas!"
1,Trouble with Windows XP,"This old program seems to have trouble with Windows XP. It changes the resolution to something that Windows XP considers ""less than optimal"". Consequently a mysterious panel keeps popping up offering me the chance to change the resolution. Of course, the panel disappears whenever I hit any key and then reappears about 15 secs later only to disappear again. At this point I'd rather teach my kid to drag her nails over a chalkboard than mess with this anymore."
2,not as good as it looks,"I was so excited when I got this product, but as it is easy to use (I really don't know how to peal pineapple) it has many defects:1. you have to remove a big part the pineapple on the top in order for the device to roll, so you are loosing around 2 to 3 slices of it.2. when you are rolling the device to cut the pineapple, all the juices of it are squeezed out, the pieces are still a bit juicy, but not as good as when you cut it a knife.3. with all the juices coming out, you are left with a messy working place."
2,I wish it was Gone.......,"One thing I hate is not finishing a book, but I got half way through this, and had to put it away. I felt it was a chore to pick it up just to read a few pages. There was absolutely no excitement or power to this book. Definitely not recommended."
3,A bit of a bore,"I also, like many others, love reading Jonathan Kellerman books. So I eagerly grabbed this one when it came out. But I found it to be a bit boring. I love books that I hate to put down or will be eager to get a chance to continue reading. This story didn't give me that excitement. It was ""average"" at its best. I have always loved the Alex Delaware books in the past-------perhaps it's time to have him move on to a new profession and Kellerman find some new heroes."
4,Another excellent Audio book,We are Kellerman fans and John Rubenstein as reader wowed us again. We enjoyed giving six hours of our life to this excellent book.
5,Funny Stuff!,I just love Bill Cosby. His sense of humor is fantastic. This book has lots of good tips mingled throughout really great funny stuff. This is a lighthearted approach to a serious subject. I sure enjoyed reading it. When finished I felt like I need a bit more information to help my son with his career direction. I found Major In Success by Patrick Combs to be the perfect addition to this book. Bill made me laugh and gave me some helpful tips to pass on to my son and Patrick laid out the step by step approach on how to get a great job. My son really enjoyed reading Major In Success. I recommend all parents purchase both books.
1,"lightweight, but disappointing","Grounds come out uneven, there is a lot of static electricity, so the grounds go all over the counter. The various parts fit loosely and get looser as the machine ages. And it's really loud, esp, in the morning. After several years of putting up with these shortcomings just bought a Solis Maestro. Cost more, but you get more."
2,"Messy, Messy, Messy!","Well, it grinds ok, I agree with other posters about the fine grounds, but I'm not the coffee fan in the family here, so ignore my opinion on that. However, I am the one that makes the coffee each day, and oh my is this thing MESSY! The static provides a mini-coffee explosion upon opening the canister, the grounds get stuck in the duct that leads to the canister and they have to be dug out with a knife/spoon something to that effect. I really wouldn't recommend it just on the basis that it is SO incredibly messy."
3,MESSY...but works well,"Just as other reviewers have stated, the biggest problem with this grinder is static. The instructions tell you not to wash the plastic receptacle or the anti-static coating will wash off. Even without washing you ol' friend static electricity ensures that you get coffee grounds everywhere.My only other complaint is that you can't just set the quantity and leave it. The quantity is adjusted by changing the amount of time the grinder is on. So, the quantity varies with the coarseness and you still end up measuring the coffee after it's ground. I'd prefer to set the grind and amount and then have a start button.Functionally it grinds coffee much better than a blade-type grinder."
4,It was a good book but not good for 5 stars,It was a good book you'll really enjoy it! its kinda weird because its like about odd things like the leaky water fountain and how Florence Waters ( the builder for the fountain) makes this big huge thing! that everybody could use not only just that school could use it but everyone can
1,Worst Book Ever,I read this book and absolutley hated it. If I could I would give it 0 stars. It was so obvious what was happening. Some books I read I cant put down. This one I could put back on the bookshelf. I suggest you read a different book cause this was horrible.
3,Underpads,"I have found Prevail underpads are better then most other brands. They are usually better padded and usually have small borders all around which is good because it means more padding all over. Some underpads have such big borders on sides and especially on the ends that it really cuts down on the padding area. What I don't understand is sometimes when I order Prevail from Amazon they aren't always of the same good quality. It varies even though they always come in the same packaging? I have found if I buy Prevail from other Medical supply companies I can count on quality. I don't know why. You would think if it came in the same wrapper and package it would be the same but it isn't from Amazon??? Don't get me wrong, I trust ordering things from Amazon more then any other place except for these Prevail Underpads?"
3,"Solid basic start,",The book is a very simple and basic outline of the art of matting.Solid foundation.
3,She's blonde!,"I know the online picture (and even the picture on the actual box it came in) shows this bride with light brown, maybe even auburn colored hair, so let me tell you right now that it is definitely not. We chose this figurine for our cake topper because the hair colors were pretty similar to our own in the picture. However, when it arrived (bonus: shipping was speedier than promised) the groom was as pictured while the bride was platinum. Oops. We painted it ourselves so it ended up being a fixable problem, but nonetheless one you should know about when ordering."
1,Out of Date by 6 months!!,"Shipment of pods came with a best-before date that was a full 6 months before delivery. Be aware that Amazon lists all ""grocery"" items as non-returnable."
1,Shipment was expired by 2 years,"I was really looking forward to these pods based on the reviews. Starbucks is good, but I prefer bolder taste.... imagine my surprise when I ordered 2 boxes - both were expired! One expired back in 2005 for gosh sakes. I admit that Amazon agreed to credit me for cost plus part of shipping, but geez, 2 years expired!!! I'm hoping to find local San Diego area shoppe that carries pods so that I can try something different than starbucks."
4,Good quality and Flavor. Very economical,Contrary to a previous reviewer I would rate Starbucks Espresso Pods slightly above Espressione Classic Espresso Coffee Pods. My rating would be 4 1/2 stars. Particularly good flavor is the outstanding attribute. Packaging and distribution have improved some in San Francisco. In the past they were often unavailable or outdated and impossible to open without a weapon. LTR
5,ESPRESSO FANATIC FINDS PERFECT MACHINE,"Tried the inexpensive pump espresso machines from Europe. They make a fair espresso, but take up a lot of space.Then I saw LUNA by Espressione at amazon.com. This machine is powerful, sleek in design, makes a superb espresso, plenty of dry steam for milk based espresso drinks PLUS it doesn't take up a lot of counter space...it takes up NO COUNTER SPACE. I've got in mounted in my breakfast room next to my wetbar. LUNA is beyond words. For the guy or girl who has everything...this is a perfect gift.Tried pods from Italy...they were ok. Purchased Espressione pods from amazon and they are great. Rich, potent and incredible flavor.All in all, THRILLED with the LUNA."
2,All Beauty - no brawn,"Beautiful european design with brilliant space-saving implementation. How could I resist? I couldn't. I should have. The shots were always good until it started to leak hot water all down the wall and onto my countertop. The steam was always marginal, needing to pause several times during steaming to allow the boiler to recharge. Finally the leaking water and impotent steam forced me to send it in for repair. It has never been the same since. After several weeks it now leaks water worse than ever. The steam is slightly improved but nothing to get excited about. Looking back on the whole experience, I would have to say that the first year was pretty good and then it was down hill ever since. Many a man has been beguiled by beauty that in time fades to remorse and anguish. In the case of the Luna that time frame is about 1 year and the remorse and anguish are in the form of leaking hot water and lackluster froth."
1,Broke after 6 months.,"I got this as a birthday present. I was not very happy with the design as you cannot wash the aluminium bowl(It's stuck to the base, not a removeable). You're suppose to be able to use it to grind spices too. Just think what your coffee smell like after you used it to grind garlic or pepper. You can't wash it so the smells stay. Over time wipping with tissue just won't do as the coffee or spices residue builts up inside the grove and crevices. My coffee has a very unique smell and taste after some uses.I can only wash the plastic cap. It is also very noisy. This morning it just stop dead. I am throwing this junk away without any guilt. A big disapppointment. Definitely won't recommend it to to any one."
4,Juicer Noir,"A good, funny mystery. Without spoiling anything, I can say Vukcevich gives the reader compulsive tap dancing, juicer-pushing Russians, some original virtual reality, and a neon ""TOFU"" sign flashing outside the detective's office. He does a great job with the detective's multiple personalities (which could not have been easy). The novel isn't too ""technical"" at all, nor is its appeal limited to the computer geek set. My only complaint is with a few of the secondary characters, who seemed a little two-dimensional and wavering. I expect this will improve with future novels (which I eagerly await). I also wish Vukcevich had pushed the boundaries a bit more. The novel toys with surreal comedy in some wonderful moments, but always comes back down to standard mystery themes. Overall, a very promising first novel well worth the price. Vukcevich is an author to watch, if not a name to pronounce."
1,what is happening to society?,"I am a sixth grader, yet I am DISGUSTED with the ""soccer culture"" What is happening to our society? We are conforming to mini- vans and trying to keep up with our neighbors!!! The fact that this book was published shows the lack of character in our world."
1,Terrible book,"After finishing Mr. Mee, I was furious! Andrew Crumey put me through a sometimes interesting but most excruciating story and didn't even give it an ending. It's almost as if he just simply stopped writing and didn't end the book. What was it all for? I thought that the book was going somewhere, but it didn't. Very disappointing book."
5,A Superb Guide for Beginners and Experts Alike.,"Steve Bain's book on CorelDRAW ranks among the best books I've read on any technical subject. The organization is excellent; essential tools are named and described in the first few chapters, and then explored in detail later along with the remaining tools and functions. The author's command of English is wonderful; the book is clear, concise, coherent, thorough, and readable. I have been concurrently reading through this book while I use CorelDRAW at work, and am enlightened at every turn of the page. The desire to praise this book (& author: thanks!) inspired me to write my first review for Amazon."
5,Great Teaching Tool!!! A+++,"This is one of the best-designed books I've used. The notes, tips, and cautions are plentiful, which really helped to enhance the topics. There is also a quick reference to special features called Power tips. A large tear out section of keyboard commands is included in the front. I had no idea there were so many shortcuts.I found the illustration techniques uniques and extremely helpful. The tables not only show the function of a tool but where to find more information if needed. The whole book has cross references to other sections, great help.If you are looking for one book on CorelDRAW 9, you can't go wrong with this one, it is excellent!"
3,good while it works,"I was reasonably pleased with the T700 for the 1.5 years that it worked. The Acu-control system is useful although it doesnt do such a great job for moustache trimming. It charges quickly and never once failed to operate because of discharging. However, hair does get stuck inside the acu-control and it also seems that hair flies out of the system a fair bit since some of it gets on the mirror. I am particularly unhappy though that it failed to worked within 1.5 years since I use it only 1-2/week; this is most likely because of moisture getting into the system since it does sit right next to the sink ! I am trying to get it repaired but if that fails I will probably switch to the panasonics."
3,Looks sturdy but drum busted after 2 months,"My 3 yr old got this as a present for his birthday and loved it! Unfortunately, after only a couple months, he hit it hard with the provided drum sticks and the natural rawhide drum surface split right through. We were shocked as it seemed so sturdy. We taped it up and it has held for awhile but is starting to split in more places. It was such a nice, loud drum and seemed extremely well made. For the price, we really thought this would last longer than the plastic alternatives. The accompanying percussion pieces are all still in excellent shape. It's only the rawhide drum top that we have had problems with. We are really disappointed as our son loves music and still plays with it daily, even in its taped up condition."
1,"As an Engineer, I find this gizmo an insult to my profession","After 25 years making my living as a design engineer, I get very discouraged when I come across a product such as this which is so poorly designed.It does not do the job it is supposed to because of glaringly obvious design flaws: The teeth that are supposed to grip the nutmeg are too short and too blunt. The grater blade is cheaply made and grinds rather than shaves the nutmeg. The locking mechanism is awkward and hard to use. Save your money and buy a micro-plane grater."
1,Not what I was expecting,"OK, I received some Revolution tea from a friend, and I enjoyed them (Oolong). I decided to try out the other flavors, and figured the sampler would be a good way to try. Unfortunately, I did not read the other reviews carefully, and expected the packaging to be the same as the non-sample packs, which have 16 tea bags per box, and 6 boxes, which equals 96 tea bags. These have 10 packs, and each pack has 5 tea bags of each flavor mentioned. This is only 50 bags for $21.88, which is not a good value when the 96 bags of 1 flavor is the same price, or less. Had I known this, I would not have ordered. There's a chance that you may not like one or two of the flavors, and you'll end up with 10 or 20 tea bags you'll never use. I think they should at least include 60 to 70 tea bags, and maybe some other flavors, then it may be worth buying."
5,Dr. Kaku is very brave,"For a scientist to advance such theories, he has taken a risk.But what risk are we talking about? Academic? No. Because the fleet of scientists who believe in parallel worlds is getting bigger day by day.Truth changes as new discoveries are brought to light.This book is no exception."
5,WOW!,"Definitely, TWO THUMPS UP!!! This is one of the best book for fun read among all books I have ever read for more than thirty years. The topic is a hard-chew, but Michio Kaku made it so soft you can swallow as easily as milk. It is not a surprise why so many complete physics lay persons read this book and all of a sudden became in the know about modern physics. Yes, this book is that great, very easy to read and at the time very thorough! But, more importantly, perhaps most importantly to me, the book is so much fun to read!!! I have read many sci-fi books, but this book is probably much more fun than any sci-fi's that I know. This is why I used to often read this book whenever I got some headache. It gives very fresh refreshment like rural breeze. I do not often recommend a book for a read to friends because they are just different from me in many points. But, for this book I strongly recommend anybody to give it a try. You will never get disappointed for sure."
4,"Kaku vs. Hawkings. If you only can read one of them, make it Kaku","I know little about physics. The concepts of worm holes, black holes, space time and special & general relativity give me a headache. However, to a layman this book is so much more complete than Hawking's ""The Grand Design"".I really enjoy the 10% of the book's content that I can truly comprehend."
3,"Okay, could be tougher","I bought this kind of protector because they weren't selling the Prince Lionheart seat protector (I have been using one of those). I think the mats are okay, but the issue I have is that they are not very tough on the bottom, so when you're putting a heavy carseat on top of one in a car with leather seats, this protector won't protect your leather seats from being stretched by the car seat. The Prince Lionheart seat protector is really thick and tough on the bottom, so the contours of the car seat won't dig into your actual seat. These Kiddopotamus protectors are much softer, so they don't offer a lot of protection from stretching, although I'm sure they do fine for stains and such. All in all this product is well-made, but I would recommend it for cars with cloth upholstery and not leather. If you want something for leather, try the Prince Lionheart ones."
2,Not tall enough,"The mat looks really nice, but it was not tall enough to cover the upper part of the toddler car seat from digging into my SUV's leather seat. The Sunshine Kids Ultra Mat worked much better, and completely protects the seat."
2,This is not for beginners!,"Each of the three workouts contain poses that are too difficult for beginners and some that could be very hard on the knees. The AM section doesn't give enough time for warm up before going into some severe stretches. Also, the instructors move through the poses too quickly."
3,Not for everyone,"I was hoping to get some flexablility back, but they don't start as easy as I would like (My arms don't bend that way!)"
2,Lead in a children's food toy,"I did not expect it to actually cook a marshmallow but I knew the kids would love the novelty of ""roasting"" a marshmallow indoors. And they do love it. I am just concerned about the lead warning on the box stating to wash hands after handeling because lead is ""known in the state of California to cause cancer, birth defects..."". S'mores are generally eaten with ones hands so the use of lead in any children's product seems out of place. Otherwise they built a neat toy. And maybe they could have included a light bulb or found one that was not so hard to track down."
1,A hit,"I have to change my original review which called this a disappointing toy. . . after a week or so, my 9-year son has pulled this out over and over to make Smores, once when a friend was over playing, and the friend also loved the toy. From my adult eyes, this was nothing special -- but I must say my son seems to really like it. I'm glad Santa brought it!"
1,Lead warning,"I was reading the directions and I noticed a WARNING label and it stated ""This product contains lead, a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects, and other reproductive harm. Wash hands after use."". I called SPIN MASTER(1-800-662-8339) the company that manufactures this toy and the customer service rep stated that the electrical cord contains lead. Use your judgement but I returned our s'more maker. (Lead has been known to be contained in electrical cords but the more responsible companies use cadmium in stead of lead due to the health hazard lead posesses)"
1,Smores maker,"The prodcut worked ""ok"" and was more fun to think about using than to actually use. I would reccomend, sticking to the traditional way."
2,Somewhat superficial,"For me the most useful thing about this book is that it has a lot of score excerpts that are useful if you're teaching at a university with a poor library. In the last few years a lot of valuable primary source material and interpretive writing has become available in book form through publishers like Musiktexte, and in scholarly journals like 'Perspectives in New Music'. I think the book is a fairly superficial survey, and I know its often used in introductory courses, but I don't like to recommend it to undergraduates because it's not a model for good scholarship because of the lack of citations like footnotes or endnotes when information comes from other sources."
1,"Ripped off, missing disc",Have had Unstoppable for some time but never opened it until this evening 6/4/2011 and found only the digital copy.
5,Adrenalin,"Someone posted that this is pure escapism. That is true, the public safety, FD, PD and helos are pretty stupid but it was fun to watch ."
4,Exciting movie,"Unstoppable is a fast-paced, exciting movie with plenty of action and good characters. You'll have a hard time deciding when to go refill your popcorn."
5,unstoppable,"A good action pack movie and as always washington was great, he is one of my favorite actors so that is it"
3,Another runaway train,"The title says it all, Another movie about a run away train. I was never on the edge of my seat during this movie, The movie left me feeling like haven't i seen this story line before with different actors? I don't think this movie was up for any awards in the US at least."
1,the director and writer should be embarressed!!,"This movie is so mind-numbingly stupid I was shocked it even got made. It's not even good enough for a B-grade movie of the week. Over the top cinematography, some of the worse dialogue ever written and a sound mixer who should be forced to watch Ishtar on a continuous loop for the rest of his/her life.Chris and Denzel should fire their agents and use the ""script"" to get the flames started.Use the 1 1/2 hours you'll save by not watching this ""train wreck""- by spending quality time with your cat...or beat your head with a hammer. Either would be better than watching this waste of celluloid."
1,So Predictable...,"Terrible script. VERY predictable. Same schtick from Washington... This makes the people managing and operating freight trains look like morons, and I don't think that's true. If they operated the national train system like they do in this movie... In fact, it was so corny and unbelievable, I couldn't watch the entire film."
5,Trains and speed,"Bought this for my grandson who is ""Train"" crazy. Action and Speed are the main attraction for him. It is worth having something an adult can watch too."
4,Fast paced and unstoppable,"Tony Scott teams up with his muse Denzel Washington to direct this action thriller. As the name suggests this is about a train run amok laden with toxic chemicals and heading straight for a populated town. This is a movie where one can easily speculate the end but the film succeeds because it was partially based on real life experiences, the editing, action sequences and the direction stand out. The lead actors do not have much to do but play out the age old rookie and veteran roles. I could not take my eyes away from the screen; the last time this happened to me was when I watched `Speed' many years ago. Four stars. 4/22/2011"
4,OK. It got me....,"I ""like"" action movies, but usually ""enjoy"" cerebral movies.This is Not a cerebral movie. LOL!Watching it on Blu-ray on my big screen, however, I found myself actually standing up and pacing the floor, more than once, during this movie....I ""cared.""Well made, well acted.I was actually grinning (instead of my typical ""Booing"")at the Pure-Treacle coda.It got me.Excellent."
5,Great action movie!,"I really enjoyed this movie. Granted, I have a thing for trains but I thought it was a smart action movie. My initial thought was it would more of a ""made for TV"" type film but I was glad I was wrong. The plot, while certainly enhanced for Hollywood, was plausible and well portrayed given that it was inspired by actual events. If you like a good action flick and, especially, if you are a railfan, you want to see Unstoppable."
1,lousy,I bought this sprayer assuming it was a pressurized sprayer.After trying it out I find it is not pressurized you have to pump handle every spray.One pump is about 2seconds of spray.This was not explained in the product discription.Now I will have to pay shipping both ways to return it and i'm not happy.Not happy with the sprayer or amazon!
4,Far better than some would have you believe,"I think the key with albums like this is to remove yourself from the group who puts the album out.If you loved the very first Orbitial albums and came to associate a narrow view based on those, then you would likely not find the ""final"" album to be any good. In its own light, however, this album shines.The typical electronic bliss that is Orbital is present here, and it's marvelous. The simple fact is that this album is essential for any self-proclaimed Orbital fan."
3,"Not bad, but didn't inspire me","This book jumped right in with tutorials, which was fine with me since I wasn't looking for a ""learn Illustrator"" book. Many of the tutorials were pretty good, but there wasn't quite as much variety as I would have liked. I guess I was hoping for a few more projects that would ""inspire"" me and get me going with new ideas.Friends of Ed continue to bring out books that are full of promise but don't quite live up to my expectations.Still, it's not bad and I hope Matt writes more books and ""lets go"" even more with cool ideas."
5,Great grinding options,This pepper mill/salt shaker gives you three grinding options and we use them all. It has lasted well for the 2 - 3 fills we have gone through and we use it often. Could have had some slightly larger compartments but that would have made it a little big for the kids.
4,Religious cruelty,"I've read numerous accounts of religious cruelty, but it never fails to amaze me how religious zealots will stop at nothing to force their beliefs on others. But what is more amazing is how they will even kill each other over trivialty of doctrine. The extra history concerning the printing press and the evolution of books was a bonus. Now with the internet and the information age at hand it will be more difficult for the church to control the minds and bodies of intelligent people."
4,Up and Down,"Gaiman goes for diversity here, made especially clear by his choice in artists. And as with any mixed bag, you'll like some more than others. I prefer the clear lines of Milo Manara, P. Craig Russell, and Frank Quitely, and found Gaiman's storytelling more to my liking there than the abstract episodes (art by Bill Sienkiewicz and Barron Storey). The Delerium story is told in a delerious style, yes, I get it, but I'm not blown away. Glenn Fabry does the art for a tale that reminds me of those old EC science fiction stories - no real explanation, just an anomaly and human reactions fused in. I liked it. Miguelanxo Prado provides some Sandman backstory and depicts the Endless back in the day.Would I recommend this book if you haven't read other Sandman books? No. But if you have, want more, want to see some beautiful art, and don't want to miss one of Gaiman's best stories (""What I've Known of Desire""), definitely take the time for this collection."
3,A quick glance into the Sandman universe....,"Gaiman did an outstanding job at finding the right artists for each story. The book is a beautiful collection of art and design, but the stories feel incomplete, lacking the ""kick"" and ""umph"" of Gaiman's earlier Sandman work. Desiny's story, for instance, is 8 pages of Gaiman retelling Destiny's duties and realm. It's like reading the beginning of Seasons of Mists, but with different art work. Other stories are abstract fragments that left me wishing there was more. If you're a Sandman fan, you'll have this quick read already. But if you're just being introduced to the Endless, grab Preludes and Nocturnes, and save your 25 bucks."
1,Hazardous,This scooter is awful. My rather small 5 year old received it as a gift and was constantly catching her foot on the training wheels trying to make it go and w/the trainers off there isn't enough room for her feet. It's definately going back to the store!
4,A BIG NOTEBOOK,"In more ways than one. FOR THE PRICE this is a really good notebook. I love it. The keyboard is great, the CPU is FAST MORE THAN ENOUGH ram. A nice big screen to watch those DVDs.Now for the negative. WHY would they make the power supply SO BIG it makes it so hard to make this ...portable, its as big as a brick. Not enough video ram, 16 megs is just not enough. Its rather noisy, I put a cd in there and its sounds like its going to take off. The battery life is TERRIBLE 1hour 30 minutes, if time is important to you get another battery (it takes two if you wish) The terrible battery life is to be expected though considering the power and screen size you are carrying around.Despite my negative comments, I recommend this system it has a whole lot of band for the buck."
3,3 stars at best; ended up returning it and got the ihome clock radio,"After reading many reviews about various systems and the not so great sound quality, I wondered if the raters were being a bit picky.....but after buying the iboom boombox, that doesn't seem to be the case. The sound quality was ok. There is a hissing that people have described, especially at the lower volumes; even at higher volumes, the sound quality is good at best. I ended up returning it and got the ihome clock radio with remote instead- much much better sound and quality."
3,I felt had a concern the mat might have an odor,The product arrived quickly & was as advertised. Have been very busy so have not had a chance to use the yoga mat/block/belt yet but it seems to be fine. I had a concern the mat might have an odor based on other product descriptions but it does not.
3,dvd not really for beginners,"The mat, block and strap are all great and I give 5 stars to this, but the dvd was not what I'd call a beginners yoga workout. I have a little over a year's experience with yoga and I've never taken an actual class (just dvds) and I ordered this to make sure the placement of my feet were correct. The exercise ""Daily Yoga"" on this dvd was more of an intermediate level in my opinion. I've had a few other dvds from Rodney Yee and loved them so I thought this would work well for me but it ended up being just a little too difficult.My recommendation for beginners is to also order the yoga dvd from Rodney Yee called ""Yoga For Beginners"" found here [...]It is a much better lesson for actual beginners just starting out."
5,Great for beginners,"I've been practicing yoga for many years but wanted to move onto more advanced poses like crow so I decided to purchase the kit for the block and strap since it was time for a new mat anyway. I wish I had done that a long time ago; doing moves with the block and strap make a HUGE difference. I feel more comfortable in poses I'd been doing for years, it's renewed my relationship with yoga. The video that comes in the kit isn't my favorite, at times it's even creepy but the tutorial on using the marked mat, block and strap is very helpful. I'd recommend this kit for every beginner and even some long time yogis."
2,Don't make my mistake - buy from Amazon,"I bought this in a bookstore instead of the thick mat I was going for since it seemed like a good package deal - block/tape/mat for as much as a thicker mat would have cost. The block is fine, the mat is thin, and the DVD is in paper - not even a cardboard covering,and so this got bent.Buy it from Amazon since at least you can return it. Since I opened the package and tried to play the DVD (thats how I found out the DVD was bent), they're not going to take it back. No more bookstore purchases for me."
4,Way to go Libby!!!,"I really enjoyed reading Speechless....in fact I couldn't put it down. I immediately liked and related to Libby, the tall, bushy haired, bouquet catching heroine of the novel. Although the novel does have a good dose of romance the focus is more on the journey that Libby makes as a person. She lands what she thinks is her dream job as speechwriter to the minister of culture. In reality she ends up carrying the minister's handbag around just in case she needs a ""touch up"". But through hard work and determination Libby eventaully proves herself and finds her voice not only as a speechwriter but as a confident young woman. Written with humour and wit I felt by the end that Libby had become a friend. The only disappointment was that the book had to end. I hope to read about Libby in other adventures. For anyone looking for a good book to curl up with that's entertaining, humorous, and inspiring I would highly recommend this read."
3,Not quite...,"I tried these out for my teenage autistic son. Although they are labelled for ""youth"" they were too big for a teenage build. Probably better for young adults or smaller built adults."
1,Awfull!,Not as represented for sure. Barely works for daily incontinence and totally useless for night. A complete waste of money
2,The product is good but the company have packaging and storage problems,"I bought this item for a lady who has stage four colon cancer and recently paralyzed. When I received it, the packaging was confusing because they used an unrelated product carton (a used baby diaper box). Then, 2 of the 4 plastic bags were broken (have small holes), when the nurse opened them, she found cockroach eggs on some of the diapers and some were inside the bags. She showed them to me and uses a trash bag to sealed it and throw it away. I had to vacuum the carpet afterward because some eggs were dropped onto the carpet when she opened it. The patient used up one bag (22 diapers) and she likes it; I think the product itself is good. But today, I opened the last bag and found cockroach eggs again. I took a picture of one of the diaper that has cockroach eggs on it and I happen to see Amazon's request for reviewing this item in my e-mail today, so I decide to write this review. I'm very disappointed."
2,Price Keeps Going UP!!,"The product is FINE, but the price has ratcheted up TWO TIMES now. I started the ""subscribe and save"" program several months ago. Great deal, right? You sign up for monthly deliveries and then get an added 15% discount. WRONG! The starting ""subscribe and save"" price quickly bumped up from $30/case to $42/case, and this month I am shocked to see it at $51/case. That was the price I was paying through regular retail outlets!"
2,Waste of money,"This camera is a joke. First of all, the phone display has such a low resolution that it is virtually impossible to recognize anything on any photo taken. Second, the pictures themselves are very disappointing (resolution, color, brightness etc.). The camera is essentially a useless toy. If you want decent digital photos, buy a digital camera (you'll have to carry the Communicam around in any case)."
2,"""unquiet letdown""","This is not even close to the quality that you will hear on Volume one.Starting with an annoying atonal indulgent piece, I was hoping the rest would be good.Of course the Grieg piece is wonderful, but I have other recordings of it just as fine.I was hoping for beauty in the unknown, but the rhapsodies are common sounding, andoverall the disc is not what it purports to be....quiet or reflective. a sad find...."
1,"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry: A Unit Plan (Litplans on CD)",I was very disappointed when I received the guide. I had my school purchase it for me. There were questions under a specific chapter that related to another chapter. The study guide questions seemed like they were prepared haphazardly. The writer did not capitalize on many other themes that emerged from the book. You can prepare more in-depth questions without paying the money for it. I would not recommend it to anyone.
1,Never broke carafes like this!!!,"I am VERY unhappy with the fragility of these carafes. I am ordering my THIRD one in less than a year and a half. In over 40 years of making coffee, I NEVER have broken carafes until this model. Once this maker dies I will never ever ever buy Braun again. What an expensive coffeemaker this has turned out to be."
3,"yes, it does break easily","It may be ""scratch-resistant"" but it sure isnt' break resistant. This is also my fourth carafe which broke while washing. The machine is great but as others have implied, it gets expensive replacing the carafe once or twice a year. If I could do it over, I woudl have bought a stanless steel carafe."
1,Too Fragile,"These carafes are definitely not dishwasher safe. We've had two break in the dishwasher (yes, someone is a slow learner). Great coffee maker, but they need a carafe which can take just a little everyday abuse."
2,Not as good as the original,"We had the older Braun coffee maker and it rocked. The original carafe had a small lip at the top that caught any stray coffee grinds/sludge and prevented it from being poured in the cup. An ingenious and useful design detail. The new aerodynamic design may be pretty, but it's less functional and less durable.Plus the coffee machine itself, in my opinion, does not get hot enough, so the yield is poor. I switched to a Bodum french press and found I could use a 1/3 less coffee and still get a stronger cup.Braun products are not as good as they used to be."
1,Braun 12-cup FlavorSelect Replacement Carafe,My carafe cracked rather easily - I only had the product for 2 months and now I cannot find a replacement Braun carafe. Other carafes are easy to find but not the Braun. I previously had a Mr. Coffee coffeemaker and the coffee pot never cracked and that coffee maker is 8 yrs old.
2,Defective glass,"Braun makes a great coffeemaker, but they could make a better quality of carafe. Mine cracked around the handle where it is attached to the top of the carafe. Luckily, I was washing it when it happened. If I had been pouring coffee, it could have been a hazardous experience. I did however, use it for almost 2 years before it broke. It would be nice if the carafe lasted as long as the coffeemaker!"
1,Thin Skin Carafe,"I Bought my BRAUN Coffeemaker 11 Months ago. The Coffeemaker is a good product but, the glass Carafe is paper thin. this is the second time I am replacing it in a month. I learned, you do not wash it by hand because you cannot apply any pressure to the glass without it cracking. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Never got to use it!,"The carafe to our Braun FlavorSelect coffee maker broke as it was being removed from the box. We never got to use it! While shopping online for a replacement, I came across this site and these reviews. Based on the info from other users, we've decided to replace the Braun with another brand that is more user friendly. That's too bad, we usually love Braun products. They blew it on this item. Thanks for your input, it saved us a lot of aggravation!"
3,My little Hotwheels lover....,"My Aunt bought this set for my son. It took three adults to put it together, and it still doesn't work correctly. The ""swiveling"" bridge gets stuck, and the rev trucks never make it through the entire course without getting stuck. You can change the appearance of the rev trucks by changing the top of them. Trouble is, the tops don't stay on very well, which my son finds very frustrating. I was going to get him another Hotwheels set for Christmas, but I changed my mind!"
5,a sequel better then the first,"Fireheart is now a warrior and so is his friend Graystripe and ther back with the rest of the gang. so far tigerclaw is now deputy, yellowfang has been exepted as the new medicine cat, firheart meets his sister and fireheart and sandpaw become FRIENDS! shadowclan has a new leader, windclan is back in there terrotory,riverclan is now venemous towords thunderclan and a forbiden love sprouts. read the book it will have you on you toes."
5,"~~~~(,,,___,,,)(=^.^=) My idea of a story of warriors.","Goldpaw was about to be clamed as warrior with her friend lightningpaw.They were part of the ThunderClan and there leader was Greenstar.""My clan I will clam these young cats as warriors,""said Greenstar.""Goldpaw you are now Gold pelt"". she was happy she faint.""Yea don't get to happy,"" mutterted Leapordspot.Greenstar roled his eyes.his deputy nightheart came and whishpered something.Greenstar nodded in agreement.""lightningpaw you are lightningheart,"" said the leader. ""Burrrr.It is now cold and it was hot,""said gold pelt.then an army of Skyclan cats came up in angry looks.the leader said""Attack!!""(=^.^=)To Be Continued(=^.^=)"
5,Amazing,I liked everything about this book. It was so good. I would recommend this to anyone who loves adventure and animals
5,You will be seeing things about your kitty-pet in a whole new way.,"Ok,so I read the first book and I loved it but this one is 5x better.Most of the readers thinking about buying this book have already read the first book.If that is so,then ""fire and ice"" is the book for you.I love Erin Hunter."
5,Love blossoming in the midst of a tradegy,I loved this book and all the others. Fireheart and Greystripe get into some fights but it all works out in the end. Greystripe meets a female cat that he really likes and Sandpaw really suprised me. It's a great book and I hope anyone who reads it likes it as much as I did.
4,Charge Up Your Day!!!!,Chibi-Robo is one of the best pastime games i have ever played. although there is not much of a story to it its a great game for when your bored but i wouldnt play it every minute of my lif because although its a good game you kinda get bored of it after playing it for over an hour
5,"The BEST comic about gaming, hands down.","KODT is awesome. If you have ever slung the old gaming dice in the past or currently game with your friends, give these comics a look. Funny, funny stuff. A+"
2,Low quality,"No a belt that's made to last forever. The material is cheap but the picture sure made the product look good, Either way, it'll still hold up your pants."
3,"Good book, a few too many meaningless movie quotes","I had the same complaint as another reviewer, where I could have done without the movie quotes. I was more interested in what Peter's friends said about him, in particular Spike Milligan and Harry Secombe. This really changes my views of Peter Sellers. Although he was an extraordinarily funny man, he was very much a weak human being, the book casting most of the blame for that upon his dysfunctional mother. Either which way, it sounds like Peter would have been an interesting person to know, and his antics belong front page in the NATIONAL ENQUIRER; because he was a wild one. I am not trying to belittle Peter Sellers in any way, as he is one of my very favorite comedians (and still is, even after reading this book), but I think Spike Milligan put it best when he said: ""Peter Sellers is not a genius. He's a freak."""
4,Great premise,"I was hesitant about picking this book up, knowing something about the author and his penchant for geek arcana and the vernacular. Thankfully, it didn't get in the way of the story.Once you've settled into the well established world early on, the rest of the book is a breeze and a most enjoyable romp. Add to that the beauty of setting the story in future DisneyWorld, and you've got quite an original idea.It's a quick, compelling read. You won't be disappointed. And rest assured, ""It's a Small World"" isn't part of the story!"
4,enjoyable quick read,"I picked up this book yesterday on the strength of Amazon.com reviews, and I finished it this morning. I am very glad to have found Cory Doctorow's work, and am looking forward to reading Eastern Standard Tribe and anything else he writes. If you enjoy the work of Rudy Rucker or Neal Stephenson (to whom homage is paid in a reference on p. 97), odds are you'll like this book. Down and Out takes place in a time when death and scarcity have been defeated, money has been replaced with ""Whuffie"" which are credits based on reputation with others, and political power is managed by ""ad hocracy."" This is a light and very enjoyable quick read."
3,speculative brain candy + zero plot = maximize your utility by reading half of it,"Entertaining for its worldbuilding, otherwise lightweight. In the future, we've conquered death and scarcity, so the only currency is Whuffie. Whuffie is respect. If you have average Whuffie, you live in an average bungalow. If people think you are worthless, you sleep in a pod and eat protein nuggets. Whuffie-rich folks like Cory Doctorow have capes and flying palaces or something.People do daily or weekly backups so they can always be restored to a clone. Some people die and restore dozens of times a year. Some people get 6 Ph.D.s because they've got the time. Most people are kind of bored.This book falls into that odd category of books where it's worthwhile to read about half of it and then just quit. The plot is, um, predictable."
2,superman you should be ashamed,"Greetings fellow amazonians I just wanted to warn others that Superman, yes the real one, rated this box set 5 stars. How in the world can he claim to be unbiased since he starred in the tv show. Amazon should not let the actual superhero rate his or her own products so to skew this precious rating system that we all love so much. I have downgraded my rating by two stars to offset what is a plant from Superman and I will stop purchasing any of his products knowing now how he does business."
2,"Review Of The Product, Not The Show.","Well, I'm on my 2nd one and about to return it for a refund because WB did not give this a good design there were huge flaws with both, the 1st one was missing a disc and every disc was scratched the 2nd one a lot of discs were scratched and it did affect playback. WB needs to get their heads out of their butts and release a Blu Ray version of this set because they're durable (when was the last time you seen a Blu Ray scratched and GREAT quality my next one will be bought in a store, so the return will be more convenient if i experience the same results as the previous 2 smh. I just wanna sit back and enjoy the show LOL."
3,Blu Ray or Get Out,Release a Blu Ray complete Set and i will get it and give it 5 stars.No Blu Ray... not worth it.
1,The box was beat up and disc 57 did not play.,The box set was not in the best condition. The booklet with the season breakdown fell apart soon as I opened it the first time. The disc slots scratches each disc every time you remove or put the discs back. A lot of the discs had dried-on glue globs on them which totally compromised disc 57 and it would not play. Horrible design for storing discs. Overall just a shoddy product. Only reason it got 1 star is because I loved the series.PS: The DVD quality is washed out compared to even the web versions you can see on Hulu etc are richer in color and 720 hd. This is NOT hd DVD for the most part. The latter seasons look better bust still not as good as hd.
4,Scratches,"I really like the casing it is packaged in. However I think because of the way it is packaged, some of the discs have small scratches on them. So far only two episodes have been effected by these scratches, the others have not been significant enough. Other than these scratches, this is a great product!"
4,Smallville Review,"I loved this show growing up i think i was in the 6th grade when it first started, not long after that 9/11 happened. I loved re-watching this series and might watch it again next year, The DVDs were packaged better then i expected and only a few were scratched,(only reason for 4 stars instead of 5) but all played with no problems i was half expecting to have the nightmare of the Stargate SG-1 complete box set where almost all the disc came so scratched that they didn't play. This purchase was well worth the money for me and will be for anyone who loved the show growing up."
5,This is a great coffee maker!,"It makes coffee FAST - 50 secs per cup, including the drip time.The hot plate keeps it hot enough, and the new, improved carafe does not drip or leak when pouring. Coffee always tastes full and fresh (it has a water filter, also). This is my second Braun KF 180 - the first one I had for 10 years. Love it!"
5,Excellent functional design,This coffee maker is of excellent design. It has many convenient features and is easy to use. It makes a good cup of coffee and keeps it warm without scalding the brew. I cannot speak to its longlevity as I have only had my machine (the similar KF-186) for 18 months.
1,Watery Coffee,"I'm writing this entirely to prevent anyone else from making the same mistake I did. That's my only motivation, it's a pain having to bother writing a review, especially a negative one. I bought this coffeemaker for my girlfriend's birthday after reading all the positive reviews. There was only one reviewer who said it made watery coffee and that he had confirmed with the manufacturer that it was designed to allow some of the water to bypass the filter and coffee and go directly into the carafe thereby effectively watering down the coffee. I was hoping he was mistaken. Unfortunately, he was right and Consumer Reports and all the other reviewers were wrong. It does indeed make watery coffee, even when set to the darkest/strongest setting. I took it back and got a Krups Aromaster instead which seems to work satisfactorily. Wish I had better news but forewarned is forearmed for the rest of you!"
2,"Good coffee, if you can get it to make some","Almost every time we make coffee, which is every day, as soon as the filter is full of water and heavy, it swings out from the machine. Sometimes this engages the shutoff and you just have to go back to the kitchen and hold the basket in place until enough water has gone through to lighten the basket, which is very annoying. Other times you end up with water and grounds all over the counter, dripping onto the floor. Yay!"
3,Cool but fragile,I really loved this...until it broke. Then the next one did the same. The absence of the rectangular metal collar around the interface makes these very prone to breakage.
1,Will the real Bruce Springsteen please stand up?,"I'm sorry, I've been a lifelong fan of Springsteen. I'm all ready to hear different interpretations of his music, but some songs just aren't meant for the banjo treatment. Bruce! Get a clue, they're not shouting ""Bruuuuuccce"" any more.... Just something that sounds like it. Don't get me wrong, the material he covered from Seeger influenced music is fine, not my favourite, but he covers it ok. Turning ""If I should Fall behind"" into a three-quarter time waltz... A song full of angst such as ""Growing up"" becomes a square dance with good old boys as the chorus... My ears are bleeding...."
4,One of the best games ever created,"One of the best games I ever played, and was addicted to was simcopter. It was easy, entertaining, engaging.There was no killing each other, it was a search and resuue mission(s). The downfall was that people would get stuck in buildings, in mid-air etc.There are a great deal of fans out there regarding this game. Someone should remake this game without the people getting stuck, make it as easy to fly, and maps to show you while in the copter where to go, and you could make a fortune.There are other helicopter pc games out there, but they are all killing, and not a good old fashioned game that is easy to fly.If possible, get that game, check it out...make it better. Thousands will buy it.Thanks,Lynnp.s I would be the first to buy it."
3,Graphics,"Sim Copter is an okay game, but when it comes to graphics... well let's put it this way... the graphics are AWFUL! People look polygon-like, like a square body and triangular head, you can't tell if it's a sheep, cow, or dog, or anything like that.When you fly your SC2K city it looks like a second grader made a city from cardboard and paper and a pree-schooler painted it. If you don't care for graphics then this is the game for you. Aside from the graphics it is a pretty good game. i personally enjoy hijacking apaches from air force bases and destroying the city with missiles and killing people with guns, even though you loose a ton of points and money. oh well."
2,SimCopter: In the eyes of a true gamer,"SimCopter, in its most confusing ways, is one of the most expansive low-grade flight simulators I have ever seen. The graphics are VERY poor, but the game itself is very fun and interesting, full of twists, turns and FUN. Beware, the upgrade option IS NOT YOUR FRIEND! Use with caution, and as always, have fun and don't expect something magnificent, because it's not. Also import cities and fly them as you please. Overall, a good game, but be a smart shopper. -CJK"
1,SimCopter...,"If you are a SimCity lover like me, you will enjoy SimCopter. You get to fly around your favorite SimCity 2000 city in one of many helicopters. That's the only good part. The main point gets dull, and the 3-D engine is horrible. This is a game for sc2k freaks, but not for the average buyer. Barf!CHEAT BOX: press CONTROL+ALT+C at the same time and enter in the box: superpowermultiply - when you press shift, you go extra fast. Nifty for across-town fires. shields up- NO DAMAGE! I'm the CEO of McDonnall Douglas - after typing this in, go into the hanger, Visit the area you buy helicopters and press 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Then go back outside and; tada! ALL THE HELICOPTERS.If you enjoyed my review please e-mail me at ThomasG86@Juno.com"
4,"Brilliant, but not gripping","I hate to say anything bad about this game, because it really is brilliant. But I simply didn't find that it held my attention that well. It is very easy to pause this game and forget about it, while lesser games keep me riveted late into the night. Maybe this is a good thing...."
5,Great For the Price!,"I had a client get a Christmas Cockitiel from me for her Daughter, When she came to Collect the bird the cage she brought was WAY too small for a Cockatiel to live in! She didnt have alot of money to spend But I would not let her leave until she got online and ordered something a bit bigger for the bird..For the $14.00 this was a good Deal.The cage is not super heavy but its plenty sturdy enough for a parrakeet,Cockatiel,Lovebird,Finches,Ect..Thee was enough room for plenty of bird toys,food bowls(it comes with food bowls and two perches)It has a flat top ,Which I like,As you can set toys or bird play gyms up there.The Kid is happy ,The Bird is happy! This is a good deal for breeders who want to sell birds with cages included ..Shipping is a bit pricey though! All in all..A great deal!"
4,Easily better than Final Fantasy VIII,"When I started my gaming month this februari I was convinced it original features, especially the spell casting is great (take note FF VIII). NOX reminds me so much of those great Japanese rpg's that I used to play on my msx I am getting all misty eyed just thinking about it.NOX is a much more hands-on rpg in contrast with FF VIII and as such much more enjoyable. Where as both games are quite linear NOX gives you much more freedom of movement with lots of hidden areas to find and explore.the only drawback is that the real-time fighting sometimes feels a bit hit and miss and lacks the strategic feel of turn based battle.However I found this to be the only drawback and if you have completed FF VII(7), which is so much better than the follow up, I strongly recommend this game.CheersShaft"
1,Diablo meets Whack-a-mole,"When I first started playing the game, I thought I had purchased a classic. Something as simple as Diablo, but with a story, an immersive world, and a few unique twists (like the conjurer class). However, after a couple of hours I was quickly proven wrong. Combat eventually deginerated into what could best be described as a mideval whack-a-mole. The challenge of combat boils down to this: try to get your mouse to center over a rapidly moving target, while healing and/or trying not to get hammered. Some of the enemeies moved some damn fast, I literally spent an hour running around in a circle while trying to hit this equally fast thing with a few dozen spells. Eventually I figured out the trick then that makes all combat trivial (no spoiler here). Then I felt no desire to finish the game. Wait for Diablo 2. In the meantime play PlanetScape, Thief II, Unreal Tournament"
5,Brookes awsome,I really wish her record label wouldnt have dropped her before this release cause its an awsome cd its cool to buy it off here but it wouldve been even cooler if it was in stores but really its great you should get this cd buy it here who care the price its worth it! hope she gets signed to another label that will make her even more famous!+her show on VH1 is awsome watch it youll see!See Ya! get this album!
3,ok...i guess...,i'm a motorhead fan but i'm not overly impressed with this debut album. to me the sound isn't that great and lemmy is just starting to work on his growl. my favorite motorhead album is hammered but i discovered the bands years ago with ace of spades. there are a few good songs...iron horse being my favorite off this album...but i find the entire album to be lacking.
3,Not the metal band,"Ok. This band rules. Battery is one of the greatest 90s hardcore bands from Washington D.C. This album unfortunetly is the worst release. Check out Until The End or Only The Diehard Remain if you want to go crazy and mosh in your room. There are some good tracks on this album though, so pick it up. If you don't like it, imagine cranking this album up to 11 and go buy the other 2 albums."
1,cheap copper,"This ice bucket is NOT solid. The box has the word ""solid"" covered with a sticker that states ""decor"" copper. Essentially the description is misleading and incorrect. Anyone who was lucky enough to get solid copper was just that . . . lucky. This ice bucket is just cheap looking. The brass know looks substantial but that is about it. bought it for a wedding gift, but am too ashamed to give it."
1,Broken in less than 10 days!,We bought this as a Christmas gift for our daughters. We liked the fact that it has 2 microphones so they would not need to fight over them. The cd player was used ONCE and it no longer works. I am not stuck listening to the awful Barbie song that comes with the player (my kids play it OVER AND OVER). This was not even close to worth the money!
1,JUNK!,"I was excited to receive this CD player for my daughter because I wanted to play her lullabies at night. I thought it would be great also for when she got bigger because she could sing her little heart out! This thing did not work from day one! I put a CD in and all it did was make scratchy noises! I returned it and a different one was sent to me and again from day one it doesn't work correctly either! This new one that I have everytime you put a CD in the song starts playing and the music stops then comes back on, over and over again! $52 for making my daughter miserable listening to this? I have tried to email this seller a few times and no response. Not very happy at all!!!"
1,Stopped working after a week,"My daughter received this as a Christmas gift. She played with it about three times and then it just stopped working. It won't turn on at all and Emerson is saying I need a receipt for repair - uh, it was a gift, we don't have a receipt. Completely crappy product and equal customer service. Am waiting to see if I hear from the corporate service manager for a reasonable solution."
3,very dissapointed,"I was very excited when we received the item, however as soon as my 22 month old started playing with it , it would fall apart. I am constantly putting it back together. It does not stay together well at all. It's too bad because my child really does like the toy but becomes frustrated when it falls apart. I really regret buying this item."
2,poor design; not very fun,"The kitchen does not stay together well. The first time my 22 mth. old daughter played with it, the kitchen came apart. We also found it difficult to close it back together."
1,Terrible!,"These are feeble metal. There is no cover for the screen, or click wheel. Does not protect against even the shortest of falls. Easily breaks. I had mine for 2 weeks, then it fell apart. I had it in my pocket all by itself, and perhaps I hit something while I was walking, and it bent, then snapped completely apart! Terrible product! Don't buy!"
3,Not as good as the1,Not as good as the first movie but there was some funny parts in the movie a ok rent for x mas
3,It was ok.,Obviously the first is always the best but this one did make me giggle a little. It was funny and worth a watch if you are having a lazy afternoon.
1,Awful,This is the worst attempt to squeeze more $ out of a classic. There was no effort to even make a decent movie here. Just a cash grab.
2,trailer scares me,"Yes, there have been 7 movies made about Jean Shepherd's family before this, butEVERY one of those had Shep alive and narrating and making sure the story followedHIS vision. I have listened to hundreds of hours of Shep's radio shows and read hisstories and NONE look or sound like that trailer. The leg lamp never came backin any story I ever heard and though I remember Shep talking endlessly about hisfirst cars, I do not ever remember anything as silly happening as in that trailer.I worry greatly that this story is simply trying to make money off the legend ofShep and the original Christmas story. Seriously, Shep is legendary for his endlessstories over almost 20 years at WOR radio in NYC-- I can not believe that no onecould adapt some of those stories for an actual script based on his work. I willmake a final judgement on just how lousy this sequel is after I see it. In the meantime,I suggest you watch A Summer Story which is the actual sequel to the original move."
2,not even close,"the writers could have did better than this. i doubt this will be a clasic like the first.not very funny i can only do this movie one time. could have did better what happend to the dogs,and the bully. from the first to much prfanity not somthing you can sit with small kids and watch"
1,I should have zoomed in,"Not the sequel to one of Christmas's faves I had expected. Cast selection was poor, i turned it off halfway."
3,it was ok,There was too much swearing in for me. They could have used other words instead of all the swearing. other than that the plot was cute.
3,Christmas Story 2,"This is a pretty good attempt to follow up on the Parker family when Ralphie is in high school, but if you're expecting the same magic as the first one, you will be disappointed. The producers should have at least used the same house. It's still standing in Cleveland. Ralphie's character is closest to the original. The ""Old Man"" missed the mark because it wasn't written right. This old man is grumpy and antagonistic toward mom. None of that was part of the first movie. Randy is all wrong. Again it's the writing, not the acting. Producers need to be sure the writing is true to the original before giving the go ahead on a sequel to such an iconic movie. It's not terrible. See it if you loved the first one. Just don't expect it to move you the same way."
4,Ralphie is back!,Ralphie is amazing with same looks and facial expressions. His dad is even better than the original. All the characters are perfectly cast to bring back the magic of the Parker family Christmas.
2,Lack of originality with a side of corn,"This movie basically attempts to replay all the good parts of the original classic but they miss the mark terribly. Every single copy cat scene was poorly executed. I think I chuckled once in the first hour, then had to stop watching. Very disappointed."
2,"Disappointing, if you loved A Christmas Story.","With an all-new cast, and a teen-aged Ralphie, this is just not the same story. There were parts that were very funny, but overall I was very disappointed. A Christmas Story is my all-time favorite movie - my expectations may have been too high. The narration is the same, which is good. Ralphie's desire for a car and a girl, though, was just not a good story-line for me. It would have been better told by Randy (the younger brother)'s vantage point."
1,again disapointed,"It you liked the original Movie you will be disapointed, it is just a rip off of the original theme, the new cast can't compare and it is a different house, don't waste your time or money on this one, Christmas Story is a classic this one is junk!!"
5,A very good and quite fun follow up movie,"Got to see this Christmas Story sequel today. It was a very good movie. I was skeptical of it at first, but was delighted at how much fun it was. Don't go in expecting the actors to be the same as the original, but they played the parts well. Give it a chance and keep an open mind, and you will enjoy it."
3,Movie,"This movie wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, I thought it was kind've cute but nowhere near as classic as the original one. I thought after reading bad reviews this was going to be the worst movie I've ever purchased, but it's really not."
3,Missed their chance,"Being a fan of the original I had high hopes for this one. It was O.K. but it could have been much better. The actor who played ralphie was too 'over the top"" goody goody for the role. I really hoped to see the bully Scut Farkis up to his old tricks and ralphie besting him one more time ala ""Karate Kid"". That would have been a great ending. And Daniel Stern gets an ""E"" for effort but there is really only one ""Old Man"". I can't picture anyone but Darren McGavin in the role. Hard shoes to fill. Also why could'nt they get Melinda Dillon for a ""cameo"", maybe as a grandmother or the aunt who made Ralphie that bunny suit. Lots of chances missed by the writers. 3 of 5 stars."
3,A christmas story 2,Just okay....I would have loved to have seen the original cast in something like this. A little over the top acting...
2,KirKir,i am 9 years old.This game is great fun but if you play it like every day it gets so boring that I ended up hating it.
4,This game is fun but hard,"This game is very fun. The graphics are nice but the animaters used lots of dark colors. This game is more hard than easy but I like it. I havn't finished it yet, and I don't think I will finish soon. My favorite weapon so far is U.F.O. and my least favorite weapon so far is sleep. I think you should buy this game if you like hard games. Age 9"
3,oops,"Have not been able to use device yet, was told it would fit the standard apex of Milwaukee 12v driver, which it does not, sure I will enjoy when i get around to using it."
5,This is a hidden treasure!,"I saw TC Carson on a talk show discussing his new CD. I really had a hard time locating it because it was listed as only ""TC"". But my perseverance paid off.It is a great sit and talk (a sip a little wine) type of CD."
1,Freonfishing,"I love TC Carson's voice, and I too loved his rendition ofmy funny valentine. However, the song selections on this albumwere terrible. I did not like this album."
5,A great book to eat your way to good health.,"Molly Siple's cookbook Recipes for Change focuses on eating your way towards good health during perimenopause and menopause. Ms. Siple and Ms. De Angelis, both nutritionists, take great care and expertise in writing this manual. Not only are the recipes delicious, they contain ingredients to stop many of the bothersome complaints of perimenopause and menopause. Both authors have a great understnading for women's desires to treat their complaints naturally and through good food choices. They work to show us how specific foods will help with such problems as insomnia and anxiety. This book has been featured in my online perimenopause/menopause support group HotFlash!. Many of my memebers have tried their recipes and love them, try the Sunflower seed muffins.Sue RN, BSN : ) suespa@caro.net"
1,Just ok,"We found the box easy to put together, but the part that controls the lid was too stronge for any child to get back down. We had to buy a new one. Can't tell about the durablity since we just bought it for our grandchild."
4,hinge tricky but great service,"We bought this toy box after shopping many places. I wanted something that was versatile and safe. The one on display looked nice, but we noticed the saftey hinge missing and ripped up holes in the lid. We assumed it was damage from careless customers. The box went together easily except for the hinge. The picture in the instruction sheet is somewhat misleading. We put the hinge on incorrectly causing the screws in the lid to pop out. Just like the display did. I called the manufacture. They emailed photos on how the hinge should be attatched. Only now the lid was damaged from before. They are mailing me a new lid for free! GREAT SERVICE! Before installing hinge I would suggest calling company and asking for the photos to avoid the confusion."
3,"Cute toy chest, generous size","We bought this for our 5th child because it didn't look like a typical ""toy box"" and we wanted something she could use after she outgrew ""Little Tikes"". But we discovered after assembly that the hinge was unacceptable. The provided hinge does prevent the lid from ""falling"" down and also from closing completely without a little effort, but it only held the lid open approximately 8 inches, and she would bump her head every time she leaned in to get a toy from the chest. She could also easily close the lid herself, and little fingers were bound to be pinched.I am still glad we purchased the toy chest, but I would recommend purchasing a better quality hinge."
2,Good for an old game.,"This game is good for when it was made, but it lacks the on-going game qualities of other Maxis Sim games. A good buy for a short term amusement.In the game, you are able to build plot-like fields of farms with varying types of crops, like strawberries or grains. What you want to plant will depend on where you are located in the U.S. (which you choose at the beginning). Little icons appear to show you if you have pests or other problems with your crops. You can apply chemicals by tractor or plane. I never could get the crop duster to work very well, though. Then you harvest and can sell immediately or wait till the price goes up. But the price might go down, or you might wait too long and your crop will spoil.Personally, I'd probably buy another Sim-type game over this one. It is quite outdated for today's graphics and sounds, and is not very complex. For the time, it wasn't too bad."
5,synbats,Good book but got a little far from reality at the end. Riley should stay the central character in all of the free beret books!
2,Bach the organ works,"A poor, jumpy, amateurish and unimaginative rendition of the pedal exercitium in g minor is what sticks to mind. Although its only an exercise i think it's worth more than that. More interesting stop combinations could have been used here. The toccata and fugue in d minor was too 'fancy' and was a boring affair overall with a silly choice of stops. I expected more from Peter Hurford. If this is the first time you've heard organ music please don't run away beacause of this. It can be so much more intersting.Overall i dont think these performances do Bach Justice. Better versions can be found at virtuallybaroque.com (not my site)and better still competely free."
3,Doesn't Live Up To Expectations,"There is no original storyline anymore, Pascal is just repeating what happened in the beginning to Gaia. Her dad is gone again and she still doesn't have Sam. Sam should just be out of the picture if nothing is going to happen with him and Gaia. It is getting boring. And the Ed and Heather thing got very boring! Why couldn't they resolve their conflicts and move on, it got old pretty fast. I just hope 17 is better than this one."
2,Pretty but impractical,"This is an attractive looking pot rack but, as you can see in the picture, the hooks move freely on the ring. I found this to be a very unstable, inconvenient and somewhat dangerous design. It is necessary to arrange the pots carefully to maintain the balance. Removing a heavy pot from one side of the rack tends to cause that side to flip up and the remaining pots to slide to the opposite side, often resulting in several pans crashing to the floor. For rarely used items it might be suitable but it doesn't work well for pots that will need to be removed & replaced frequently. I used this pot rack for about 2 years but finally replaced it with a much sturdier wall mounted model."
2,"Just buy ""Paralyzer"" as a single.","I'd heard some of Finger Eleven's earlier work, and thought there was some potential there. When ""Paralyzer"" started playing, I really liked the sound, picked it up, and played the CD on the way home.It was something of a let down, as the CD was not cohesive and no other songs stood up to the expectations the single created.The album's not BAD, it's just BLAND.I'd say stick to the single."
2,Disappointed,"As much as I loved the first track I was hopeful about the rest of the CD. However, the remaining 10 songs were pretty slow. There were only about 4 that were okay. The other 6 in my opinion were not good. It's disappointing. I absolutely loved the first song, perhaps other CDs of theirs are better."
2,Fozzy's new CD destroys this.....similar vibe but way better songs,"Fozzy's new CD All That Remains Reloaded was similar in approach vocally, yet Jericho believe it or not is a far more interesting singer and has better melody. Fozzy is heavier than Finger Eleven, but yet it's much easier to find yourself singing along to Fozzy. Check out the Fozzy CD and do yourself a favor........."
2,So sad,I waited a long time for this album and what a bad surprise when i heard it for the first time too pop too light and only two inspired songs.Please go back into studio now to make a real album
3,Finger 11,"Only purchsed this CD so i could have Paralyser to listen to day in day out, the rest of the songs were a let down for me purely because i don't know much about the band and haven't heard any of their other releases so i was expecting more songs similar to Paralyser, instead i found the rest of the album to be quite mellow."
1,Copy Protected - Avoid,"I bought this album expecting to use it the way I use hundreds of others I own - on my computer while I work. This album is copy protected and won't play in the computer's DVD player. I assume they don't want people to rip the songs or make mp3s, but I consider that a legal use of the material when paid for.I am returning this album and will never own another album by either Finger Eleven or Sony. If I need any songs from them I'll record them from the radio."
3,A Disappointment,"After I got Tip years ago, I was sure to be at the store for Finger Eleven's new releases the day they came out. I heard Paralyzer on the radio and thought it was a catchy tune. A little more poppy then what I'm used to, but a good jam. It didn't get any better then that on the album. I always thought that Finger Eleven's weakest tracks were their slower ones. Most of the stuff on this CD is pretty mellow for them. The dark, distinguishable feel is gone, replaced with a pretty un-unique, watered down sound that you'll hear on most radio stations. The lyrics are tired and unimaginative. Scott does show off his great voice throughout this album and the songs are well arranged. It's a decent CD, but won't get as much play as their other 3 in my CD Player. These guys are rockers, I hope they return to their roots. I'm afraid I won't be at the store the day of release for their next album, I'll wait and see..."
2,Poor Premise,"I couldn't stand the woman, The premise for the story was poor, I liked the father apologizing. The guy was fantastic, too bad he had such poor taste in women."
4,Great for the $$$,"I really like this crib toy. There are many functions to chose from. My son has the fish one, so I decided to get my daughter a different one. Actually my son wouldn't give his up! Anyway, the only setback would be to take out stock in ""C"" batteries. I seem to be replacing the batteries every two weeks and the battery compartment is kind of a hassle. Besides the above minor complications, I would recommend this product."
3,Shop Around,"I like the developmental ideas behind the soother. (The poems, songs and stories.) However, the motor is loud and the light is too bright. My friend has the Fisher Price aquarium soother and my son LOVED it. I am going to get him one. Just shop around and ask your friends with kids for advice. Good Luck"
5,love it,"my 3 1/2 month old has loved this since birth. It's the only way I can keep her calm in the crib. When I lay her down she immediately turns to look for it and moves around with big smile while I sing with twinkle twinkle little star. It's a battery monster, I recomend rechargeables."
2,For older babies!!!,"I thought that since I was buying a Leap Frog item that I would be happy, boy was I wrong! My son sleeps on his tummy, so that could be a reason for my displeasure of the toy; but the main things that I don't like it is the knob to turn the toy on, and also the overall size of it. It's so bulky that if my son moves to close to the bumper he could hurt his head. It's defintely a battery drainer! And the sound doesn't go up high enough. I was going to buy the fisher price aquarium sounds but instead I went with the dreamscapes soother, BIG MISTAKE!"
3,Not the Run-of-the-Mill Ant Farm,"As a child, many of us have had ant farms, well, did you ever wonder what it would be like to be in one? Here's your chance. This game is cheap and simple to learn. Pros:--It has a simple to learn interface and everything is self-explanatory--Controlling your growing ant empire is a cinch, click there, the ant goes there, push that, yougo to the corresponding screen. Everything flows.--It has very few system requirements. A Mac Classic with a CD drive could practically run it!It's cheap!Cons: --It is too simple, all you need do is sit and wait. the computer who controls your empire in all the different sections of the yard will slowly oust the bad ants until you win.--Has little replay value. Once you win it, all the other games are the same.Overall, I would reccommend this game, just for the fun of it. But if you want a game to get addicted to, one that you can play over and over again with a challenge, you should consider looking somewhere else."
5,Sim Ant Rocks,Sim Ant is one of the best and most fun computer games i have owned and i am really bumed that i lost mine!
3,Not for me.,"A well written book. A little too liberal for my tastes, but interesting nonetheless. Good book to use for school papers."
5,A brilliant book on America's tragedy in Iraq,"This is a brilliant book on America's tragedy in Iraq. While Michael Rubin is correct in pointing out some bloopers - the historical section on how Iraq was created in 1921 is also historically askew - nonetheless you could not improve on this book's brilliant insights into the American side of this tragedy, with genuinely well-meaning people winning the war but losing the peace, and with the situation actually worsening considerably since this book was written, with civil war now even more a likelihood than before. Read it and learn its sad lessons. Christopher Catherwood, author of CHURCHILL'S FOLLY: HOW WINSTON CHURCHILL CREATED MODERN IRAQ (Carroll and Graf, hardcover 2004 and paperback 2005)"
2,Armchair Quarterback,"Well researched but naive, overly-simplistic, tedious and repetitive. According to the author, there was not a single good decision made with respect to Iraq. If only the Bush Administration would have listened to the people he interviewed, things would have turned out just fine. There -- I just saved you ten bucks and eight hours of reading. You're welcome."
4,Excellent overview - but technical,"This book is one of the most thorough discussions on the ins and outs of digital libraries I've ever seen. Lesk knows his stuff, both on the library - classification - document side and on the computer - technology side. Unfortunately, the reader also needs to be conversant with both sides, especially the technical. I feel the book is sometimes too heavily tilted toward the engineering/technology side. Kudos to Lesk, however, for his discussions of the economics of information, intellectual property, and international activities."
2,Decent for the price but HDMI easy to break off,"I too had the same issue where the HDMI connector broke off from the plate. It's very gently attached via 2 tiny screws to a thin piece of plastic. It broke off the second time I attempted to close the plate to the housing behind.It is working but loosely, so if I wiggle the cable that goes to the receiver a little too much, it can slip off to the back.A tip while doing this project is to make sure you get a fairly deep housing and get HDMI cables that have the smallest connector as possible. The HDMI connector on this wall plate would have less chance to break if my housing had more room so that it won't stick out so much and putting so much pressure."
4,I agree with the stampfers,"This game is good and gets boring, though it is exremely addictive. The help section gives you a whole lot of info when you have no idea what to do, but the game does not come with a help booklet"
5,Incredibly Awesome!!,"At first, it got a little getting used to, but after I got the hang of it, it was really easy to beat. The other reviews may say it's bad, but that's probably because they get frustrated easily and don't have any pacience. You're not going to beat it on your first try, but it's a very enjoyable game!"
1,Don't buy this product.,"I ordered this CD and two others by the Muscians of the Globe and do notlike any of them. The packages are opened now and cannot be returned. I recommendthat anyone try to listen to them first before ordering. Check out the locallibrary because that is where these are going to be donated. Over $70 wasted.I am surprised they got any positive reviews, perhaps the reviews are by thesellers? I heard one piece on classical radio station and made the error of thinkingall would be as good. They weren't."
4,"Hey, this actually works.","I love the fact that this doesn't take batteries. My son liked winding up the cars. They don't really ""race"" though. They just run around the track in a figure 8. My son (5) liked to experiment where to place the cars on the track to start them where they wouldn't (or would) crash into each other. You have to be careful about the spinning wheels on the cars when they are fully wound. They could cause injury to small fingers or get tangled in hair. There is a warning on the cars but it bears repeating."
5,Speedstars Raceway - Very Cool!,I bought the Speedstar Raceway for my 3 yr old son. My 4 1/2 yr. old daughter loves it too. It's very cool. You crank the car .. and press a button .. it takes off around the track. The only flaw is .. the outer shell of the car is made to break off when it crashes. Sounds like a cool idea .. except my kids can't figure out how to snap it back on (so I have to do it). It is easy to setup and fold up (fits under the bed). I'm happy with it.
4,Great but hard to crank,"This toy is great, no batteries, but the crank you use is really hard, my 3 year old can not do it.I suggest getting the Thrill Hoop toy as well, the crank is easier and my little girl can play all by herself now!"
1,Skip This Toy,"I was impressed by the commercial, but disappointed by the toy. The cars are not battery operated but wound up. The winder does not work. We have to wind the cars by hand. When they are fully wound the cars circle the trace twice then stop. A full 5 seconds of fun. This one will be in the closet by tomorrow and forgotten the following day. Save your money."
2,Disappointed,"I can see this toy has alot of potential, which is why I bought it for my son's 4th birthday. But I was very disappointed when I put it together, with my son anxiously watching, and then couldn't get the winder to work. It was so hard to crank...the crank kept coming off. My son can't wind it at all. My husband even has trouble. It's just not worth the effort of a few laps around the track."
1,DNF did not finish....I don't like ghost stories,"Bought it based on number of star reviews and not written reviews. My mistake. I don't like ghost stories. If you do, more than likely, you'll like this one."
3,Great product!!,These are a great product and a few other of there products are of high quality at least for the money.
2,Handle Broke,"The cannisters look great and are easy to keep clean. However, three months after I bought them the handle on the second largest one broke off while I was opening it. Amazon won't accept a return and, so far, I have been unable to locate the manufacturer to see if they will replace it."
3,Vacum seal lining broken,"Got my canisters yesterday. They look great, however the vacuum seal on of the canister was broken. They did a poor job in packing the canister for shipping. The vacuum sealant is broken into chips and looks brittle. Shipping the canisters back for replacement. Although the sealant looks brittle and may not last long, still for the price it is a good buy."
2,Lego Creator,"the working area is half screen in size, that in itself is annoying the other quirk is the views of your creation either very close up or very distant,its not what I expected."
3,Not for Newborns,"My daughter is two months old and we have been using this gym for a couple of weeks. She is entertained for 10-15 minutes at a time by listening to the music and watching the lights. My husband discovered that if she is in her bouncer, the lights are at a good height for her. I do not think that she would see them laying on the floor. She is not old enough nor is she interested in the options on the gym. I do not think that this is for newborns."
4,not good if your baby is over 18 months,"this learning gym is interesting to my daughter till she's 1 year old. after that, she's no longer interested in it. it was great when she was still under 9 months before she could crawl, because she could just lie there and look at the pictures and the sounds. i didn't like the different languages to it. yes, i love the music. it's great and loud. and the spinning globe is very interesting also. but i don't think it's a toy that is for 18 months plus."
5,So far so great!,"This is an awesome toy. My baby was 9 wks when we started him on it. He began kicking his legs, smiling and cooing to the world music and educational songs..he loved it! It was exciting to see him so stimulated. The music is fun and catchy...so much so that Hubby and I hear the songs over and over in our heads but that's okay. We enjoy singing them to the baby. The buttons are great fun too. I love the door that opens with a mirror and plays an African chant. My husband and I love to travel and we think this is a cool way to introduce our baby to bi-culturalism early on. The mobile encourages the baby to kick and exercise. All and all, a very cool developmental toy!"
2,A disappointing toy from Leap Frog,"I am a big fan of Leap Frog products, but I am very disappointed in this toy. My son is five months old and he is not entertained by this learning gym in the least. He can touch the mobile, but that interests him for about two minutes. When I try to help him sit up, he still has trouble reaching the globe. I am hoping that in a few more months, he will enjoy some of the other features of this toy, such as the peekaboo mirror. Until then, this gym is pointless while he is lying down. Perhaps more flashing lights would have entertained him in this mode. The manufacturer's recommendation for this toy to be used by children as early as three months is completely erroneous in my opinion."
2,She just never got into it,We had this toy since my daughter was born. She just never got into it. She really likes the singing but she'll listen to it if I turn the globe. She has never played with it and the mobile is terrible. It also consumes a lot of space and certainly doesn't teach languages!I do not recommend this toy.
2,Not worth the cost,"We purchased this for our son when he 2-3 months old. He did not enjoy it very much at all until he was able to sit up. The only thing he liked and could reach at that time was the mobile on the bottom, and his crib mobile was much more entertaining. Once he could sit up, he liked to play with it a little bit, but was never entertained for long. Now that he can stand, he likes to pull up on it, but has even less interest in any of the buttons. I was intrigued by the international/multi-language aspect of this toy, but I think it was too much for an infant."
1,Buyer Beware,This will not fit the new video nano's 8GB. Marketing is misleading. Wal-Mart carries one that fits the new ones.
2,Not for Current Nano,"The current 2nd generation Nano does not fit this product and no adapter is available. Belkin just said I had to buy a different product. However, It seemed like a nice product and I found it was possible to make it work with a little saw work.After doing so, it works but is picking up a noticable alternator whine. I have not yet tried out Belkin customer service on that problem."
3,Shipping Problem,The book is all I expected. The only problem I encountered was that both the box and the interior packaging were damaged.
3,"meh, it's ok","the book is ok, better than most text books, tho im sure most people will order this for a bit of light reading... hehe"
2,Star Trek: New Worlds,This have been better. It was fun for a while. The gameplay could have been better. It needs better mission plots. The grahics for this game have been improved also.
1,Good Idea - Horribly made,"As the title said it is a great idea and looks like the best star trek game ever then you start to play. First mission-explore, explore some more... fight the klingons OCCATIONAL RAIDS then explore some more...that continues to keep going for a long time until tour mine runs out of resources (constantly)! I could live with all that but no, they can't bother with the must have common sense option any worthwhile game has, The SAVE button. Personly I was imagoning security officers runing up in front of a tank fireing at some klingons, and all that classic stuff. But No they decided not to put in infantry! Basicly I am supprised I gave it 1 star.!DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
4,"Fun, offbeat show","An ice fishing musical? A show about two guys in a hut on the ice? The best Wisconsin musical ever? Surprise, both the show and songs are pretty good.Sure it's a little cornball with terse men (in the Lake Wobegon tradition) and lots of ice fishing jokes, but it's also clever, fresh, with fun, listenable songs, many of which have a depth and sweetness as unexpected parallels are drawn between ice fishing and life. The CD is not just the songs, it's (most of) the show. It was recorded during a performance so you hear the audience laughing at the jokes making it more fun. Recommended.Minor quibble -- the CD description and liner notes claim it is the whole show, but I recently saw the show at a local theater in its New England premier and the beginning of the second act (circa 2007) is missing from the CD."
1,I guess you must have been there,"I guess anyone can write a musical about anything: Hats, golf, boobs, menopause, ice fishing. But do they really need to be recorded and released? I can't think of a purpose on earth why one should buy this. It's cute, quaint, corny, etc....it is also so insider jokey, filled with bad lyrics (read Sondheim's ""Finishing the Hat"" for more on lyrics), and has incredibly banal music. There is no reason that the average American south of Minnesota/Wisconisin/Michigan (even if he/she is a music theater buff) would be amused or scream for the rights to perform any part of this. However, I liked the cover...."
3,What a shame,I sound like a broken record. We loved....I repeat lovedthis cooler. We had it for several years when it began toleak. Does anyone know of a similar cooler to replace itwith?? We live in Texas and need our water when it is over100 degrees!!!!
1,Poor quality,"I purchased mainly for the convenience for our own and frequent guests children being able to get their own water. So it's worked ok for that.As far as the components, the water cooling function lasted about 2 months. The water heating about a year. After two years, it's leaking all over the place, so now the kids can't even get their own water again.Poorly engineered it seems."
2,Get a Cheat Code and Go To Town,"Tresspasser is a prime example of a game that is better played as a hunting sim than as an action game. For some REAL fun, forget the gameplay. Get the cheat codes for unlimited ammo and unlimited firearms, grab the AK and go for the jugular. Or for even MORE fun, cheat freeze the dinosaurs, go right up to their fanged heads, and execute them a la Schindler's List style.The physics engine is frustrating. Stacking boxes only to have them fall over is a pain. Unfortunately, you have to do it. There is no ""sticky box"" cheat code.Ultimately, if you want to shoot dinos, go for Carnivore II or another dino sim. This one... eh..."
4,Short Report,"We've only had this unit a few weeks, but it's performed beautifully so far. As for long-term durability and reliability, time will tell."
4,Great basic controller,I bought this controller 5 years ago and it is still going strong up. It may lack some features but it can be programmed to a variety of emulators/games. Excellent value.
1,Do NOT purchase,"This controller had an excellent price tag. When we plugged it into a windows laptop the computers only read it occasionally and only two of the buttons worked at all when pressed. When I plugged it into a Mac nothing happened at all. I know it's cheap, but it's not even worth the $6 because we couldn't get this to work at all.Update:After testing this product for about a week, on a mac I can get the directional pads to work and the face buttons to work, but the L1, L2, R1, and R2 buttons do not work. This product still does not work at all on a PC. The PC recognizes it, and pulls up the configure options, but the buttons don't transmit to the PC."
3,Light Weight,"These controllers are light white and have a cheap feel to them. They work great for kids. Using them to play games on N64, SNES, and NES emulators, they are plug in play on a Windows 7 machine. Very accurate response time no complaints yet."
5,"Fabulous, Sensational, Breathtaking..","WIth several versions of Beethoven concertos out there, one might find it difficult to find the best one. To explain how great this 3 CD set is, I will refer to the Emperor concerto--I have listened to few different plyings of this concerto (including Horowitz and Brendel, other ones from the radio etc), but I must say that the one by Ashkenazy is the most beautiful. Ashkenazy's playing is unequalled, and while some other players tend to go too fast on some parts and thereby kill its delicate beauty, Ashkenazy's playing is sensational from start to end and will have you playing the CDs over and over. Personally, I haven't seen a better Beethoven player than Ashkenazy, and one critic has said about his playing: ""whatever Ashkenazy plays, he plays well...Ashkenazy does not interpret music, he breaths it."" Get this fabulous set of Beethoven concertos; there is no competition when it comes to Ashkenazy's playing."
5,superb,"N4 the best by far. None of the rewewers quite catched it. It is the transmission of feelings: After the unexpected, irrational outcry of the orchestra, menacing, forceful and pitiless, the piano is ""really"" horrified, frightened, almost speachless. These are the feelings to be transmitted.Only Ashkenazy has ever did this so well. Worth the whole set."
5,"The classic fighter sim, one of the best ever made.","This is an old sim. I mean, I've had this sucker for a while. And you know what? I keep coming back to it. True, the graphics aren't that great. The flight model (despite what that one guy said) is almost poor. But this sim has one thing most new sims can't duplicate. Perfect gameplay. This game is a lot of fun. It has great scripted campaigns, and the learning curve isn't too steep. This is THE most well-rounded game I have ever played. When this game first came out it was the best, today Jane's Fighter's Anthology is still ""The Mother of All Flight Sims."" This is the sim by which I judge all other sims. If you don't already have this game, do yourself a favor and get a copy. You'll be glad you did."
2,Not worth it,"Substandard targeting, invincible enemies, overcomplicated handling. You could spend your time doing something useful instead."
4,Great for the budding singers!,"I bought this as a gift for a little boy I babysit. He loves to sing so I gave him a microphone and sent him home!!! HA HA!Anyway, he carries it around and sings for his mom and dad all the time, lets just hope they don't decide to seek revenge and get my son a drum kit or something.[...]"
3,Nice toy,"My four year old really enjoys singing along with this toy. My only complaint is that, the microphone makes voices sound garbled. It sounds so bad that she doesn't even use it when she sings along."
3,It's ok,I thought this would be a cool toy but my kids don't seem to think so. It has been sitting in the toy room ever since we got it and very rarely is it touched. We don't even recognize most of the song on there. NOT a must have
1,my son hated this toy and he loves music,"didnt like ,much better learning toys out there.this toy was returned"
3,very informative,easy to read - easy to understand.I am still reading it and working through the companion workbook.so far it has been helpful for me and my sponsee's.
5,Well worth the money. Wonderful! Wonderful!,"I am not a classical music expert but I am an expert when it comes to a great product. I have listened to the works of rubenstein and Horowitz, but nothing is comparable to this great collection of polands favorite son. The nocturnes are dreamy and romantic. The other pieces though not as mesmerizing have plenty of depth and feeling. This is a collection that you will listen to over and over again. Although this music is great anytime, it's especially meaningful during a light rainfall. Go ahead and make this investment. It's only $100.00. For the next 100 days save a dollar and you will have it paid for. I promise you won't be sorry. Excellent! Excellent!"
4,Seagate drive upgrade,"Keep in mind that this is a Serial ATA drive (new interface style). Make sure your board supports SATA. The older boards are all Parallel ATA or just ATA. With that said, I have had the drives (I am running 2 of these) for 3 months and had no problems with them. They are quite and run cool. Since I have two of these drives, it was kinda tricky setting one of them up for the boot drive. Make sure you read up on this if installing 2 SATA HDDs. I hope they outlast my maxtor drives which started failing after 2 years of use."
1,"Somewhat depressing, despite trying not to be","Every play needs its actors, and someone has to sweep up the hall as well. Littlejohn says that they didn't seek to focus on the negatives, but the result is that while Las Vegas may be the fastest growing city in America, both in jobs and population; it doesn't sound that appealing other than as a place to visit.Most of the reports are glum, and sometimes downright disheartening. Sure, many cities have these problems, but most of them try to do something about it. In Vegas, if it negatively affects the Industry, then it is either ignored or swept under the carpet. It puts a dull finish on what is otherwise presented as a glittering jewel."
3,MLP playsets are not durable,"I have found out by purchasing the CCC, MLP Castle, the dance studio, and the Salon that none of them are durable...they do get played with but they fall apart ALL the time. I recommend purchasing the ponies. They are very inexpensive and very cute...we have nearly all of them. I have purchased them honestly to get the pony that comes with it for my daughter's collection...anyone who has posted a review saying these items are durable must have them sitting on a shelf or something. I suggest purchasing the big 3 story Barbie play and store dollhouse, it is GREAT...my daughter plays with MLP's instead of Barbie dolls in it...she is 5 years old..."
1,"Hit or Miss, with Few Hits","Out of the nine essays in this book, only the contributions of Fredric Jameson and Edward Said are worth reading. Jameson speaks authoritatively on Star Wars and Body Heat, maintaining a high level of analysis on popular culture concepts. Said provides a fitting bookend, as he considers the problem that marks all the other authors in the book (except Jameson, whom he rightfully praises): namely, that they write for an increasingly small audience of their fellows, bound by the walls of their disciplines and separated from political life. He impliedly bashes the preceding authors, who deserve such a bashing, as their contributions range from pedantic to unintelligible. Baudrillard's ""The Ecstasy of Communication"" is not as bad as some of the essays by his less luminous fellow authors, but it is particularly cosmic and incoherent. Overall, this book is not worth reading."
3,dont get it if you have a slow pc,"the first time i ever played this game was over at my friends house..... he had just gotten a new pc and the game was fun. but the next day i went out and bought it, and well it was very choppy. needless to say.... if you dont have a really good pc dont get the game. get delta force not delta force 2."
2,Excellent game but 3d card support is limited.,"I love this game. The landscape plants and grass that you can hide in are perfect for sniping. Buildings, tanks, trucks, and boats can actually be blown to bits. I set off satchels on a boat once expecting a burn mark on the wall, but it actually sank and tilted to conform to the lake bottom. Unfortunately, the game does not support Voodoo cards and requires a Riva card for hardware acceleration. Unless you have a very new Riva card, over 100 MB of RAM, and a 600 MGhz processor you will be experiencing DF2 with a low frame rate, therefore very choppy movement. Also, anytime you try to switch the screen resolution in the game, the game crashes. The auto-patch updater is a bit tricky as it downloads a patch for itself at least 20 times before it starts updating the game."
4,Two different Games in one,The first of these games are the single player campaign missions which while fun ranger from easy to really really easy. The enemy A.I is at its best lackluster and at worse totally moronic. To tell you truth I never bothered much with the single player missions.The 2nd game which totally kicks butt and gets you your money's worth is the multplayer part. Anyone who is a fan of Red Faction or Halflife will love this game.On-line it is a total slaughter-fest even though the community has shrank n recent years as people have gone on to either the DF sequals or something else simply to combat the rise in cheating. The other versions of the game did a much better of keeping the cheaters out.Overall-Still all in all I just love this game
2,"DF2 (Unrealistic, corny, and just plain dumb.)","Okay. Some people (Like 10 and 12 year olds) think this game is sooo cool. This game so very unrealitic. Infact, everything about this game is stupid. The weapons are okay, but when you fire, there is no recoil that makes you reticule (The cross thingy that helps you aim) go up and down. Also, 1 shot from any gun kills an enemy (Which is pathetic) so why put your M4A1 rifle on burst? Just use single shot to conserve ammo. The games graffics are as [bad] and the screams that the enemies make when you shoot them are corny and cartoony. I suggest that you do not buy this game because of the reasons listed above. Please, save your money and buy a better game like Counter-Strike (The best game ever made) Half-Life (The second best) or Rainbow Six: Raven Shield (The third best) If you are looking for realism, DO NOT look here at this game. Its pathetic."
3,Caution on Sound Quality,"For those who have become accustomed to the fine sound engineering exacted by A. Schiff, this collection is a disappointment. It is from analog tapes. It is not the tapes per se, but it is mastered at such a low level that you must turn your volume up to extreme levels just to get a normal sound level. It sounds very constrained.There are exceptional ADD transfers in existence this is not one of them. The folks should have done better.The early Schiff playing is still impecable. Light touch, simple and elegant.The sound is poor, and each time you play one you will have to adjust your sound system, and the sound is still poor."
2,"A Long, Expensive Magazine Article","Sjogren's other books are more useful than this one. His most useful books for ordinary church ministry include, Conspiracy of Kindness; Irresistible Evangelism; and 101 Ways to Reach Your Community. This book would have worked better as an extended magazine article rather than a complete book. Perhaps if he'd spent more time on it he could have made it more substantive, meriting book-length treatment. My wife also read the book and thought the beginning of the book was good - especially where Sjogren says there is no single right way to be a healthy church. Her take on the rest of the book was that he then proceeded to deny his first point, implying that the ""low-church Vineyard"" way was the best."
5,WARRIORS IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:D,This book is the MOST sad one and that's what makes this a VERY good book. I couldn't stay away from this book for more than at least 30 minutes! I was really sad about some parts (don't worry I won't spoil it) :( but in all it was a really good book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:DDDDDDDDMay StarClan light your pathBlazekitThe oldest kit in FireClan
5,feral kitty series,You will never look at feral kitties in the same way you used to after reading this series.

5,Great Book,Great Book I can't believe what graystripe did.I'm glad I got this book. It is a tragic story.but very good.
2,No Core Zen,"This book is a mass of narcissism, pontification, and muddled thinking - sort of like life, come to think of it - but hidden in it, like a diamond in a manure pile, is the essence of Zen: chop wood, carry water."
5,Hardcore Zen,"combines a great sense of humor with a skillful manner of getting across a good philosophy. Great read inside ""Hardcore Zen"""
5,This is a great game,"Its fun and the replay value is great! I'm playing it for the 3rd time now. Great ships, nice story line. I wish that you can hire more than one wingman though. I have a Voodoo 3 video card and a SB Live Sound Card and I have no problems running the game."
1,Very disappointed,"Bought these after much ""research"" and having read lots of reviews. The playing is fine. The sound of the piano however is cheap and tinny, not as bad as one person said as an 18th century pianoforte I guess, but bad enough that I hate listening to them, no warmth or feeling at all. They are VERY twangy. And this is some of my favorite music, I like these better than Beethoven's and as much as Mozart's. I am very disappointed - but only in the sound of the instrument. It's not Ax or Andsnes. I wish desperately that it were."
2,Where is Sandra Brown?,"This couldn't be the same author who gave us such chilling books as Unspeakable, Charade not to mention the breathtaking ENVY and SLOW HEAT IN HEAVEN. In The Crush, both the prose and the characters are juvenile and boring. The hero is too busy with his wisecracks to do anything competent. He is also a major screw-up and extremely stupid. For example, after issuing a direct challenge to a ruthless serial killer, he calmly returns to his motel and proceeds to take a shower - unarmed. He also endangers a woman with his careless unprofessional questioning and gets her killed. The rest of the characters are not much better. The author painted Fort Worth's finest as a bunch of dirty minded bickering teenagers who couldn't outsmart a criminal who is not all that smart.A major disappointment and quite depressing."
4,Works good so far....,I bought this pump for around $100 after looking at the other water powered pumps. (I believe the one sold by Wayne is the same pump but sells for $150.)Installation was easy and it fit into the same sump as my primary pedestal pump. I unplugged my primary and tested it for several hours during a rainy period. It pumped slower than my primary pump but easily kept up with the incoming water. So far I am impressed and hope that it works good and lasts a long time.
1,Valve leaks,"I bought one of these from Menards about 2 years ago. After I installed the unit and tested it I thought it worked great. The problem came when I got my water bill and noticed that it was significantly higher than normal. I went to my basement to investigate and put my ear to the water supply line going to the pump and could faintly hear that water was going through. I tried over and over to adjust the valve to eventually find out that my water pressure was too high but, if I adjust it to the 60 psi that the manufacture recommends than the pump won't keep up. I'm back to searching for a back-up solution. I thought I was sold on the water powered backups, but after reading reviews of many different brands I'm at a loss."
3,Not quite what I expected.....or hoped.,"While there are some nice tracks here, after a while they sounded too much alike for me, and almost a little too melancholy. I gave this CD to my massage therapist."
5,A master's best,"For all fans of Science Fiction, here's a master collection! Pohls stories, well written, original and with the charachrteristic Pohl 's sharp style are a delight to read!"
2,Disappointed,"I became a fan of Medelein L'Engle in 5th grade when A Wrinkle in Time was assigned. It was only within the last couple years I discovered there was more to the series. I thought A Wing in the Door was just as wonderful as A Wrinkle in Time. However, Many Waters and A Swiftly Tilting Planet were written in a different order with a different style and voice.Many Waters stars Sandy and Dennys--the twin middle siblings of Meg and Charles Wallace. As they are trying to fix a snack, the teenage twins go into the parents' lab, accidentally trigger an experiment in progress, and find themselves in the pre-flood time of Noah.While L'Engle uses an interesting perspective of Seraphim and Nephilim--the sons of God who intermingled with humans--she also deals with sex and puberty in language that is more appropriate for young adults. A Wrinkle in Time, A Wind in the door, and possibly A Swiftly Tilting Planet could be recommended for middle graders, but definitely not Many Waters."
1,Science fiction is not really my thing...,"Lot's of adventures go on with Sandy and Dennis Murry, the twin boys, who got bored and snuck into their dad's lab and the next thing they know there in the middle of one huge oasis.It is a biblical novel that takes place right befor Noah's ark.Also the cocept of the ""Nelphilims"" is had to understand, but they are hevenly people who turn against god and fall in love with human woman. I think L'Engle wanted to make this book excting and adventurous,but I think it was boring and difficult to follow. The names of the characters were so complicated such as Oholibamah.The story content was sometimes ""over my head."" I think teenagers might like to read this book.So what will ever happen to the Murry twins? Will they ever make it back to there time?If you really care to find out be my gust and read Many Waters."
4,"Good, but not great","I have always loved Madelineine L'Engle and especially characters from the Wrinkle in Time series, but this story didn't quite measure up. I would recommend it, though, but not before you've read the other books. The other ones, while still fantasy/science fiction, seemed a lot less contrived in terms of their main plot device than Many Waters. That said, it's great to see the Murry family again."
3,Not as Interesting as the others!,"Many Waters is about the twin brothers, Sandy, and Dennys, who travel to another planet where it's like mostly desert. Anyway, this book is not as imaginative or as interesting as the other novels written by the author. I didn't find it compelling or believable.Usually, I would love to get inside Madeleine L'Engle's head but not this time. I found myself re-reading parts and not caring as much or being passionate about it before in her other books. I would have enjoyed it more possibly with illustrations or a map of L'Engle's imaginative universe and worlds beyond earth."
4,Different approach to art world,"An interesting book. Very concise, gives you an alternative view on life as an artist and how to make money from your art. Very good section on documenting your work, full marks for that. I'll be implementing some of those ideas. It's nice to read of someone who's made a name for himself and managed to sell his art without galleries."
5,Very helpful,"I had to learn formZ for my profession and I've gone to great lengths to do so. I had already taken two courses from different instructors and I was still feeling very unstable and was about to start a new job where I really needed the skills. Stressed-out and feeling at a loss, I did a search on the web and found this book for the new 4.0. While I already had a great understanding of the program, this book showed me so many ways to do things I had not yet been taught and I was able to do it on my own. The information is clearly laid out and easy to understand. Icons let you reference exactly where to go but the best part was the tutorials. I have not been able to find in any class or supporting material that came with the software, tutorials that let you practice. This was the most helpful as it's never enough to just know what everything does. You need to implement the info. This book saved my life (and probably my career!!)"
2,Not as much as I expected,"This game wasn't anywhere near as fun as I expected. The game is slow and takes a long time to load. It is hard to learn and control. There are to many confusing options that affect how you play. In fact, most of the time, it doesn't even work. There's an 'illegal opperation' message almost every time I manage to start the game. That means that you have to start all over from scratch. I don't reccomend this game to anyone, escpeccily those who get impatient quickly."
1,NBA lockout?,"What a waste. OK, so I bought the game on the discount table at a major retailer, but still I find it not to be worth it. Far too many lockups that are confusing to correct. Game keeps going into a pause mode unexpectedly. I assumed there would be an option to turn off the Internet dial-up every time we load up the game, but I can't find one."
2,This book is overpriced.,"This book is a tool for the author to market his service. I cannot get much insight nor technique out of this book. John Mauldin's Bull's Eye Investing is selling for $17 and it's packed with all the information you need about investing. For trading, I would turn to the all time classic: Reminiscences of a Stock Operator. Human behavior hasn't changed much in the past century."
3,"Nice graphics, no story","This is a very pretty game. The graphics were top of the line when this title was released and it still looks very nice. However, the strength of the first 4 Wing Commanders was the storyline. The filmed scenes in WCIII and WCIV told interesting stories that brought you into the game. The filmed scenes in this version serve little to move the story along and are a waste (I am sure they cost quite a bit to make). Furthermore the missions are fairly repetitious - you are either in a dogfight or on a bombing run. Try Independence War if you want a challenging space sim or X-Wing Alliance or Freespace if you want a more traditional but fun space shooter."
2,sub par,"orgin really screwed up with this one. maybe they were trying to kill the series but this was the worest wc game ever. all the numerous incarnations, wing commander 1,2,3,4 and academy were awsome. the story was so immersive that after you played you really felt it was worth your time. i play wing commander 4 still at the beginning of every summer and everytime its like watching an epic. too bad the movie didnt adopt the story of the game! would have been so much better. wing prophecy was so uninspired in story that i had no interest in the plot. i was only interested in finishing the darn thing. dont buy this game, borrow it from your friends so you can say you played it. oh and yeah they killed blair. today is a sad day for the confederation"
2,Linear approach,"When I was at the University, a fellow pianist who was crazy about Vladimir Ashkenazy gave me a tape with the Mozart's Sonata K330; some days later, he asked me about my impressions on it and, for his disappointment, I told him Ashkenazy was a ""correct"" pianist. Askenazy may be a major classical artist but every time I listen to this Beethoven's cycle I feel he misses something; his playing lacks emotion and deepness and, unfortunately, I think the same can be said about the Chopin's and the Mozart's boxes. I still prefer the Arrau's recordings."
5,"Sony 13.3"" C140G Notebook","I've had this laptop for 1 week and am very pleased. It weights just 5 pounds (which it very important for me). Key pros: large hard drive (120GB), good performance (Core 2 Duo at 1.66GHz), Full Keyboard (dedicated page up/down, Home/End keys), excellent screen (for watching movies), clean look (black with copper trim). One con: a built in mic would be nice for Skype calls. Works well with a plug in mic but one more item to schlep. As to battery life, my key test is weather I can view a full length movie on a battery charge. I tend to run these from a thumb drive and I ran a 2 hour, 18 minute movie this way with 8% battery life remaining (wireless off). On a flight I wouldn't watch anything longer."
2,Unstable and crude monitor,I was a big fan of Vaio notebooks. But I was disappointed by this one. It is a usual thing for most computers an application does not respond so we need to call Windows task manager to kill the freezed one. But this one freezes too often. Sometimes I need to reboot the system and I even have difficulties in logon. I had to reboot the system more than 5 times on the day I got it. I have to point out the lcd monitor too. It surely is not the lcd monitor you might expect from Vaio. It reminds me of lcd qualities 4 years ago. Your eyes will be easily tired. I am considering of returning this one though I should pay 15% of restocking fee. Before you buy a notebook from Amazon be sure to read the return policy.
4,very good,i thought this product was fun and engaging for my 2 1/2 year old. she's just learning how to properly hold a pen and the dotted lines were great for her to follow. the sound effects made it fun for her.
3,Big Time Arcade Game,"Lego Racers is definatly an arcade game. You know, one of those you play at the movies. It's fun at first, trying to beat each racer. But after a while, you get tired of it. It's really like race, race, race, get bored and stop for a while, then come back. If you like arcede games it should be OK, but if you are into adventure or sim games, I wouldn't reccomend it."
1,Caution,"I personally put a lot of stock in the reviews when deciding to buy a book online. The contents page sounded great, the reviews were pretty good, but if I had SEEN this book there is no way I would have purchased it.My recommendation is to find a way to see the pages BEFORE you spend 20$ on this book."
2,Fall apart Castle,I was so disappointed in this item...it took me several hours to put it together because as soon as I had a piece on and moved to another the previous part would fall off. Tried super glue and tape to keep the pieces from falling off but even that didn't work very well...it is now in pieces in my daughter's room...I should have just left it in the box at least all the pieces would be in the same place!
2,Falls Apart All the Time,"While my daughter loves it, it constantly comes apart. The balconies fall off all the time. None of it stays together. I am going to super glue some of it together so she can play with it. Nothing holds the top two turrets on, where the crown and hot air balloon sit. If you walk by it, they fall off. I am very disappointed."
2,Save Your Money!,I bought this for my daughter's 4th birthday... Nice idea too bad Hasbro didn't make it durable. I was hoping it would be more like the Littlest Pet Shop stuff... I plan on asking for a refund... My daughter gets upset because everything falls off of this set. What junk! She likes to put the baby ponies on my other daughter's Littlest Pet Shop Whirl Around Playground.Save your money and just buy more ponies.....
1,This toy WON'T stay together!,"My 4-year-old daughter rec'd this toy for her birthday and she was thrilled, but I was not! Assembly req'd is one thing, but I actually used my hot glue gun to keep this thing together.I followed all the directions as written only to find out from the manufacturer that portions of the instructions were written in error. Once I got the castle together enough that she could begin playing with it, my daughter was so disappointed when then pieces started to come off in her hands, which inspired me to get the glue gun and call Hasbro to complain.To their credit Hasbro offered to replace the parts that I was not pleased with but there were way too many of those for me to be satisfied with that resolution. So, they then offered to send us 2 other toys to make up for our disappointment in this one. Those were much better!My daughter still plays with the castle and enjoys it, until the glue comes undone...then mommy heats up the gun!"
2,Spend your money elswhere,"Santa brought this toy for my two girls ages 6 an 3 and what a disappointment it was. My six year old asked me why santa's elves are not more careful while making these toys for kids to receive as presents?? Imagine how big (or small) i felt - if only companies that put out toys for parents to spend their hard earned money on - would be more careful before putting toys on the market that do not - work or fit together properly!!!! Please do not wast your money or time on this one - stick to the ponies alone or better yet - the Berry Happy Home is Awsome - Bandai did a wonderful job with that one - Made well, fun duable and smells good too - and it is the same price around (40.00) as the box -o-junk ""celebration castle"" - UNBELIEVABLE."
4,"It falls apart, but she loves it!!","Like others, I have been frustrated by how easily the balconies and other decorations fall off this toy. BUT, my daughter has loved playing with it and so do her friends. One benefit to it falling apart - you can easily make it smaller for moving or taking with you on trips. It has gone with us to grandmas and to hotels. My daughter LOVES her ponies and plays with this castle every day. In my opinion, it was well worth the money and the constant repairs."
1,Talk About a Disappointment,"My 3 year-old loves My Little Ponies and absolutely BEGGED for this item for Christmas. It was the ONLY thing she requested from Santa. I began putting it together the night before Christmas and what a nightmare!!! It took FOREVER to get it together and then when I moved it under the tree, it fell apart. It was missing parts, parts didn't fit, and all in all it was the worst toy ever. When she saw it under the tree she was excited until she bent down to play with it and the whole thing crumbled!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!"
1,Poor Quality,"This toy is cute, however, the quality is so poor that I wouldn't recommend it. The pieces of the castle do not stay together."
3,"Cute, but.....","I got this castle for my 3 yr. old for Christmas and while she does like it, I don't like the fact that you can't close it up without taking stuff out of it! Also, as many others before have said, the stickers- I don't understand why some stickers are on there already (the non-holographic ones), but then there's this OTHER sheet of stickers. The crown doesn't fit around my very small 3 yr. old's head so it's just sitting on the turret permanantly. I spent $30 on this- which I know think I was a bit of a waste- however, for $20, it's worth it."
2,I was wrong,"My daughter loves the ponies, so I thought she would love the castle. She doesn't hardly ever play with it. The stickers took forever to put on it. The crown for the child falls apart. It's cute, but it just sits and takes up space in her room."
5,The Castle every girl wants,"This castle is soooooo fun!!! I could play with it for hours and hours and never get tired ! It's soo cute and fun. I'm a huge my little pony fan. I have over 200 and this my little pony and castle is one of my favorites. It's soo sweet and every little girl would love it. The castle is durable and my parts to it haven't fallen off once, even though I've played with it many times. They snap shut tightly and are made of hard plastic. I think that this toy is any little girl or big girl's dream. It's a must have for EVERY my little pony fan."
3,fun but a pain....,"my little sister got this when she was 4 and it was really difficult to assemble.and once it was assembled atleast every 5 minutes one part would fall off.then we duck taped it and it still wouldnt stay on so finally the whole family decided to give up.now it sits in the garage falling apart,other than that it was really fun"
2,No thanks!,"I sometimes look after a 5-year-old girl who loves my little pony. I like them a lot, too and I own about thirty of them. This little girl got the castle for her main crimbo present, and after all the very hard assembly, it was only played with for a couple of days before it was put into storage. Okay, it looks pretty, but it really is so small that the baby ponies are the only ones which can decently fit in it. In the doorway of the castle is a dance floor, but when you put it on, the pony's magnets in their hooves cannot make the music work, as it covers the music button. I would not reccomend it to anyone who wants their child to get a lot of fun out of this."
2,Not as good as other MLP toys,"I bought this toy last year for my daughter. Luckily on clearance. The items immediatly popped out as soon as you popped them in. This was before my daughter even had the chance to play with it. I really was fine with the crown not working I realize no toy will be perfect. I didn't mind the stickers but all the balconies and stairs just fell right off. I glued everything but they were so badly warped they fell off within days after glueing. My daughter would huff and puff and finally stopped playing with it. I have not purchased another MLP item since. I will say though, she got the twinkle twirl dance studio for her birthday this year from her grandmother and it is much better quality. Only a few accessories but no assembly. They have restored my faith in MLP:)"
4,Buy it $10 Cheaper at Walmart.com,"Don't pay $39.99 at Target. I bought this for my almost-4-year-old from Walmart.com for Christmas. Their cost is $29.97 with only $.97 shipping...a much better deal. (However, if you buy it at the Walmart store you will pay $38.84). It pays to shop around! As for all the reviewers' complaints...we'll see! P.S. I also bought a few ponies to go with the castle for only $4.77 each."
3,Wish I had read the reviews,"Wish I had read the reviews before getting this for my daughters. My husband just superglued all the pieces on it this morning, and the castle ""door"" keeps falling off because the button for it doesn't work. Wish I had just bought two my little ponies for them instead."
1,Glad I read the reviews first before buying this.,I am so glad that I took the time to read all the reviews of this toy. My 4 year old daughter wants this for christmas and I was just getting ready to go and buy it for her. It looks absolutely adorable in the box but after reading all the horrible reviews it got I'm so glad I didn't waste my money on it. I'm going to be checking out the reviews for the Fisher Price Friendship Ponies Stable instead. Hopefully this got good reviews. Thank you everyone who wrote a review.
3,Not worth the money if not on sale!,"This toy has barely gotten any attention! As other reviewers have said, this toy is hard to put together, the pieces are impossible to snap into place. For the age group this appeals to, there are also too many small pieces. It might be an ok buy if you find it on clearance, but I defintley wouldn't pay full price for it if I was to buy it again."
1,Complete disappointment!,"I bought this for my daughter and didn't mind so much putting on the stars but the music and lights didn't work. I called Hasbro and they were very accomodating about sending a new one at no charge, however the second one also is defective. I tried 2 different sets of batteries. I must also say that she too, gets frustrated at how easily everything falls off. Waste of time and money."
2,Cheap junk.,"I'd be very willing to pay a few extra dollars to have a pony castle that wasn't a cheap piece of junk. Why, why, can't they make decent toys?I didn't mind the putting together part or even the stickers.The castle just isn't functional. What fun is it to precariously balance a pony on the tiny 2 inch wide shelves that constitute a ""room""? Why on earth not make the darn thing a bit bigger and a bit sturdier. The kids are constantly bringing me pieces that fall off when touched. The front door, the balloon landing part, the steps, the front pond area, the stupid heart and tiara. My 5 year old daughter never once played with it until her 2 year old brother finally discovered it one day.Save your money and make a cool castle out of boxes, paint, and stickers!!"
3,silly castle,booo! i think that this is a funny toy in asilly way. but it is also kinda fun.but it is also kinda strange
5,pony paradise,"I don't know why people are having trouble with this toy.It was pretty easy to put together,and the stickers were nothing compared to other toys that required alot more assembly than this toy has(if you have never put together a hot wheels city playset,this was a piece of cake).Considering how many boys playsets are so complicated to put together,and 10 times the stickers,assembly time was about 30 mins. The tirrets are made not to stay in place as so they can be removed easily by the child playing with the castle.The elevator was a little hard at fist to pull up,and down,but a little wd40 fixed that.Christmas morning was a blast,and my kiddo is still playing with it,great for gentle play,great toy."
2,MY LITTLE PONY NITEMARE CASTLE,"my 4 year old daughter has been wanting this item for quite some time, so i finally broke down and bought it for her on christmas.what a nitemare! first of all the stickers are so hard to see to take them off and put them where they are suppose to go, that alone took me about 30 minutes and i have 20/20 vision!! everything falls off that is suppose to click and stay on, there is no handle to carry, once the castle is closed up, the elevator is hard to manuever up and down, the 2 round bowl type pieces that go on top never stay on!! the whole thing is a mess!! waste of money, i think my daughter played more with the box than the toy!! good luck!!!"
1,Do NOT buy this piece of junk!!!!!!!,"All the pieces fall apart. The pony spinning is a joke you have to manually spin it, all it is, is a magnet that holds the pony on. The inside is sooo small only the minature ponies can really play inside-which means all the regular ponies sold have no playing room. Everytime my daughter tries to play the pieces fall off which for a 3 year old is frustrating, when should playing with a toy be frustrating!!!!!!!She spends more time putting the pieces back on than playing!Do Not Waste your money on this product!!!! Just buy the ponies and let your child create their own castle."
3,"Lots of fun, but falls apart a lot.","My daughter received this last year and still loves playing with it, but it does fall apart ALL of the time!"
2,Piece of Junk,What a piece of junk. I'm so sorry I asked my daughter's Grandma to buy this for her. Nothing stays together and if you even look at it the wrong way it falls apart. My daughter was so excited when she got it and now she won't even play with it. Nothing works right and even a 5 year old can spot junk. Save your money and buy something else. I'm very disappointed in Hasbro!
2,waste of money,Very disappointed in the product. The pieces that had to be attached do not stay. When my children are playing with the castle the balconies and the stage and the crown do no stay and they get very frustrated and stop playing with thier ponies.
2,Get Your Glue Gun Ready or Take It Back,"This toy is the biggest dissapointment. This was the most talked about toy among my 5 year old and her friends. What a beautiful looking toy. And that's where it stops. Nothing on this castle stays together. If you do not rush to take it back which is what I did, your other two options would be to 1- glue gun everything down or 2- Press things together as instructed and watch this castle magically dissapear. It is a piece of junk, like a toy out of a cereal box."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"My daughter (3.5) loves ponies, so we bought her this castle. It is the biggest piece of junk I have ever seen! The sad thing is that she wants to play with it, but it keeps falling apart. In addition, it takes forever to set up as there are about 100 stickers and 25 pieces to it. If you're thinking about buying this...DON'T!"
1,CELEBRATION GARBAGE CASTLE F-,"This is complete garbage! I can't believe I'm taking the time to write this but the truth must be told. The elevator is junk...they should call it ""elevator in an earthquake!"" Let your child move the elevator up and down and watch the earthquake begin with toys and the castle rocking to and fro.(a can of gear grease may help) On a positive note, your kid will develop advanced bicep muscles while working the elevator. The turrets on top of the castle are held in place by gravity: complete bush league item. Run away from this $6 piece of plastic junk and don't look back. Once again, this is JUNK!!!!"
2,FLIMSY PRODUCT,"My mother bought this for my daughter last year for Christmas. It took us almost an hour to get all of the pieces out of the box and put it together including the stickers. Parts of the castle constantly fell off, especially the hot air balloon. My daughter loved the castle because she adores her My Little Ponies, but this castle was a hassle! I actually HOT GLUED the pieces to the castle so that they would stay put. Unless you plan on gluing it together after you buy it, leave it on the shelf at the store!"
3,Bought this for my 4 yr old daughter,I have to agree with several of the other reviews. This toy is poorly designed and falls apart easily. My daughter seems to enjoy it somewhat but it falls apart every time she uses it. If I still had the box I might return it. Some of the pieces don't seem to function well which definitely makes it less fun to play with. Too bad because it looks really cool on the box.
5,A fun lighthearted movie,"This was one of the ""hard to find"" movies on my list of films I saw as a child. It is a fun and sometimes funny adventure centering around the lost treasure of Cleopatra. The scene with the drunk Witch Doctor is classic. This film doesn't use a lot of ""effects"" so it is a believable balloon story. Kids of all ages will enjoy the adventure as I did years ago. Glad to see it on DVD finally! (The Boy and The Pirates and The Brass Bottle are a few others around this time period I recommend highly)"
3,"Great graphics, OK bugginess, poor role-playing","First off, this is without a doubt the best graphics I have seen in a fully interactive game. There are times when you will actually stop and find a place to watch the sun come up.Be prepared, however, to have a lot of hardware. At times, the game becomes unplayable when it is trying to load terrain. It is especially bad in cities. Running a 350 with 128 of meg and plenty of hard drive space (oh, only a Vodoo 2), I would say I have a sixty percent playable experience.The worst part of the game, however, is the role-playing. As Avatar, you have no character generation and little customizablity. The game does not remember earlier encounters, monsters regenerate at exactly the same spot, and you can do things like walk into a jeweler's shop, pick up a gem off his counter, and sell it to the guy without repercussion. The same thing would get you killed in Fallout/Baldur's Gate type game.But the graphics are GREAT!"
2,*** PII 250 or lower need not bother ***,"This game is so advanced graphically that anyone without a mega powerful system AND graphics card shouldnt even bother..the frame rate on my pIII 400 is only bareable if i scale down the graphical settings to bare minimum...these settings include everything from the texture level to how far u can see, so if u can cope with being able to only see blocks at point blank range by all means try the game...other than the technical difficulties the game itself doesnt even feel like a normal ultima game, it borrows heavily from other titles such as hexen (which was mediocre in itself). In my opinion dont even bother if u r a die hard ultima fan with a normal to slower range computer."
5,Ultima IX: Ascension,"Ultima IX is really a great game. It's graphics are fabulous, the gameplay is awesome. I really get involved, its also huge, this will take you quite a while to finish, i've been playing it for a long time and i feel like I havn't got anywhere. There is one huge problem with the game. The system requirements. If you do not have a top of the line computer, wait for a little while before getting the game. That way it can get patched up and you may be able to play it. I have a P-3 600 with 128 ram and a Voodoo 3 and it's still pretty slow. But, i'm actually considering buying more ram, just for the reason of playing this game in its full glory. Ultima is awesome. Trust me."
1,Sucks,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME if you don't at least have a 3D FX video card. The DirectX support 'from the box' is non existant. You need to download at least patch 1.07 And even then, I got random ejections to the desktop, refusal to load a saved game, and when actually playing a SLOOOOOOOWWW framerate."
2,"astonding graphics, now they need to design the game.","Since I have a fairly new 733 pentium III, I had no problems getting a good frame speed. Even playing at full speed the graphics are wonderfull. The landscapes in this game reminded me of the German alps. No game I have ever seen comes even close to matching the visual quality of this game. Unfortunatly, this is the game's only real strong point. The quests are often long and tedious. Places are hard to find, with too much travel time. The fighting in the game is boring at best, and the puzzles are second rate. Spending the time to beat this game is simply not worth it. There are too many other RPG's out there for anyone to buy this game. Unless you are the type of person who likes playing games where you run around for 30 minutes to complete one fairly simple task, all the while fighing simple creatures by clicking the left mouse button as fast as you can, this game is simply not for you."
2,Too much work for too little reward,"I have never played Ultima before, so this was my first impression of the series. The installation went fine. Having to re-install the game after EA sent me an updated, non-crashing version of the game was a bother. The graphics were choppy, but I could deal with that since they looked so beautiful. What really ticked me off was that I would be playing the game for a while and getting through some pretty rough sections of it and all of the sudden, my ""avatar"" would fall through the floor or the game would just freeze, causing me to have to restart my game and sometimes the computer and continue the game from the last point at which I saved. This is a very long, not addictive and really, not fun game that I would not reccomend to anyone unless you are interested in looking at pretty 3D graphics and paying this much and going through this much trouble to see them."
2,Not for brown people,I brought this eyeliner but the colour was not too rich and a lot paler than I expected. It might look better on white skin than dark olive tones.
3,Very interesting premise. Needed a better last half hour.,"After seeing Landon's ""The Last Sin Eater"", and ""Love Comes Softly"", which I found to be very overrated, I didn't have high expectations for ""Saving Sarah Cain"", but the story sounded very interesting, and the movie effectively depicts the cultural differences between ""our"" world and that of the Amish, and the acting is good, unlike the two abovementioned movies. Lisa Pepper, whom I've never heard of before, does a good job in the lead as does Abigail Mason and the other kids. Elliott Gould is good too, and David Clennon appears briefly.Unfortunately, while the movie starts out very good, by the last half hour or so it turns into another sappy Hallmark style movie. If you like that sort of thing, you'll love it. If you don't, you may enjoy most of the movie anyway."
4,Heartwarming and lovely,"I love Beverly Lewis' books, and so I thought I'd enjoy this movie, too. Indeed I did. If you want something that will warm your heart like curling up with a good book and a warm cup of tea, this movie will surely suffice, ""for sure and for certain."""
1,Very noisy,"At high speeds, it is very noisy, but only periodically: lots of clicks and clacks. It was installed by a licenced eletrician."
5,Great product and ease of installation,"Great ordering/delivery turnaound. Extremely easly installation guide; just place the parts plan on a flat surface and lay each part on top of its corresponding picture on the paln, then just follow the well thought out installation instructions. Installation of each part is sequential as laid out on the part plan. Excellant idea for using the hanging bracket, no more having to balance a motor while trying to connect the wires. Selected this model because of finished ceiling height (7.11""). Absolutley no sound from the motor."
1,Worst humidifier ever,"This is obviously a cheap no-brand product and it performs like one. I have returned it and am never buying ""SPT"" (Sunpentown) again."
2,Cheap Chinese Junk,"I have a semi-submerged basement that gets a little muggy, particularly in the summer, so I purchased this unit not even a year ago to help keep the area comfortable. While the unit ran fine for about 9-10 months, it promptly began to malfunction as it neared the one year mark. Condensation appeared on the right side of the unit and frost began to collect on the coils. I have let it defrost several times, but the ice always reappears, and actually gets so thick that it makes removing the bucket and filters difficult. While it's true that I used this appliance almost constantly, I think if I pay 200 dollars plus for a device it should function reliably for more than a year."
3,I really liked the toy...,"I really like this toy and so do my three children (my oldest is now 5),--But about the only part they really play with is the music activity. I have tried to direct their play to the other activities but none of them have ever really been interested in anything else with the toys (we have the older version also). We also have had problems with the toy not turning on and not recognizing the letters occasionally. All it takes is a good whack to get it working again, but it is really disappointing and contributes to the reasons behind why my children only play the songs. I would still recommend it, though."
3,GAME WILL WORK ON 64-BIT!! THERE'S A LOOPHOLE!!!,"I loved this game when I was younger, and I've been dying to play it again!It's a really fun amusement park game, and the levels are pretty interesting.ATTENTION 64-BIT USERS!!!For 64-bit Vista and 7 users, you cannot INSTALL the game directly onto your computer, but it will PLAY on your computer! I transfered all the info on the game CD to a USB drive, and then used the USB to install the game on my netbook, which runs XP. I then transfered the now installed game files back onto my USB drive, and then plugged it into my 64-bit computer. And it worked!! Once the game is in its installed form, make sure you set the exe file to compatibility with XP, or it will crash."
1,Not Vista Compatible,The box clearly states that the game is vista compatible but it does not work on my new computer.
1,Will not work on Windows Vista!,"I purchased this only because of the fact that it stated it was compatible with Windows Vista operating system. It will not run on my Brand New high end computer. If you read the readme file that comes on the cd, there is not a mention of Vista....so if you have Vista - count on it not running properly!!!!"
2,Disappointed,Disappointed in the length of the documentary and the content. When paying over $20 for a DVD of this calibre i was hoping for more substance. Aside from the Cairo 52 story ( and not a complete coverage )there wasn't much else. Sad Journalism and even sadder for a Documentary.Had good intentions but failed to score.
4,Punches Work As Expected,I ordered this item to add holes to my belts as I begin to lose weight. They are perfect. Thanks!
2,Not sharp,"At $7.95 these punches seemed too good to be true, and they were. Since only 3 of them are properly sharp, this renders the set barely usable. But go ahead if you don't mind to sharpen them yourself, though this could be a tricky task being a circular surface."
1,very loud,"I bought this gloworm for my 3 month old girl. In the store it didn't sound really loud, but once i got it home, it was way to loud. My little one likes music, but the first time i show it to her she started to pucker up like she was scared, tried again later and same thing happen. Cute toy, but it's getting put away for awhile."
4,Baby Miranda loves her Glow Worm !!!!!,Her mom-mom bought her the glow worm when she was only a few weeks old it help it her calm down for nap time and bed time. She 6 months old now and she still loves it.
1,hated it,"i hate this toy.i bought it for my daughter for christmas, and i just took it out the box. i think i put the toy away faster than i took it out. the music is loud and there is no off button. i gave it a one because it sucks."
1,Too loud and annoying,My son is 1 year old and I thought a Gloworm would be a nice addition to his crib. He loves his Ocean Wonders Aquarium and thought something else that would light up would be nice to have.The music is loud and obnoxious. My son doesn't like it at all. You can't turn the sound down or off.This product would be cool if it was without the music.I took it back because we both hated it.
1,you can do better,"This was given to my daughter as a gift. I am not a fan...The music only plays for a *very* short time...like 30 seconds. This is not long enough for me to leave the room let alone a child to fall asleep. The music is very annoying...I can't stand it. It plays notes of twinkle twinkle etc, but the sound quality is terrible. I don't know how to describe it, but I would not find it soothing. Also no way to turn off once it is playing, just have to let it run it's course.I much prefer the Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Soothe and Glow Seahorse. We have had this for almost 3 years. It is still going strong and we love it. The music is soothing, not annoying. It plays for ~5 minutes, not 30 seconds and has an added feature of being able to turn off if you want. Choose this one instead, you won't be disappointed."
2,Not all of them have 3 modes,"We received this as a Christmas present for our infant daughter and I assumed there was a way to turn the sound off. Well when I went searching inside the doll I found that our toy only has two modes, Demo and Play. There is no way my daughter could use this to soothe herself. It is way too loud. I ended up leaving the battery pack out of it for her to cuddle with but unfortunately we also lose the use of the light that makes it a ""glow"" toy. I'm not sure when mine was manufactured or if that even makes a difference, but if you're going to buy this toy make sure it has a no sound mode before you leave the store."
2,The new gloworm could use some help...,"I was very excited to buy this for my daughter, but it turned out to be a huge disapointment. It does not have a soft gentle glow, rather a bright glow that was uncomfortable to look at. The music was not even close to soft lullibies, rather it scared my daughter and my older son every time it turned on. The music could be heard across the house, even with other noise. I was very sad to return it, but could not keep it when it scared both my children because of being too bright and too loud. I think it could really be a good toy for an older child (4-6) but not one that my children enjoyed."
2,It's Over Already?,"Pros: The light on the face gradually dims; cute; nice melodies.Cons: The music is WAY TOOOOO short!Conclusion: If you purchase this so your baby can have something soothing to listen to while going to sleep, you will be disappointed. The music will stop before you get your foot out of the door, and there goes your baby's attention from the gloworm to YOU. Not so good."
2,SONGS SHORT,"I know that i had one of these when i was younger, and i loved it so much. So i bought it for my 11 month old. He likes it but he cant get the music to start, because you have to push a hard peice of plastic to get the thing to play. Even when you get it to play it only plays about 3-5 seconds worth. Its cute but too bad the songs couldnt be longer. It was 14.99 when i bought it. No wonder the price has gone down."
5,Gloworm The Night Time Friend,I just wanted to let everyone know how our grandaughter loves Gloworm. She was about 8 months old when we bought her this Gloworm which she calls it Glowy. Glowy was her sleeping partner until she got to sleep and then someone would remove it and place on the floor. She often asked for it in the morning. We also live about 5 hours apart and it was used in the car when traveling back and forth. I give glowy a 5 star since it was such a help on teaching her to go to bed by herself and was a good friend for our traveling grandaughter.
5,Love this china set!,"We needed extras of our wedding china, which is this pattern, for a larger-than-usual Thanksgiving this year, so we ordered more. I love this china set so much -- it's classy, elegant, and beautiful... AND you can put it in the dishwasher, even with heated dry settings and super hot water. (I tested this by putting one of the saucers from this set in my dishwasher and keeping it there for six months straight, through every single wash cycle, and it still looks good as new; I can't distinguish it from the others!)"
5,"Brother 1/4 "" foot",I added this foot because I do lots of quilt piecing. I have a foot with a guide which is my favorite but this works great when there are times you don't want a guide to pull at your fabric.
5,Excellent cd,"Very, very good, no excellent cd. the vendor was quick to ship. reasonable cost. CD in great shape. Excellent. Great vendor."
4,Surprisingly helpful and insightful,"My wife got me this for Christmas. Good thing she did. I would not have picked it up on my own, since I already own too many similar works for running and triathlon. This is a great work because Chris works nutrition, base training, peak training and competing into a complete package. Its short, concise, easy to read. I throughly enjoyed it, and even in the dead of winter in upstate NY, I am applying many of the tips and techniques he provides. I dont think this book is for the amateur, first time cyclist. But for seasoned riders with a few years experience its a must have."
5,Brings You Close To Katia and SOI!!,"I thought this was an absolutely fantastic book!!! It really gets you up close and personal with the World's Greatest Skating Tour, and I loved the chapter in tribute to Sergei Grinkov. Lots of terrific pictures from all the programs through the years!! It starts out with the story of how Stars On Ice got started, and tells about the earliest skaters, all the way up to today's performers (like my favourite, Katia Gordeeva). This book is a must-have for any fan of SOI and skating in general. You will definately have to see the show in person, after this book!!!"
3,Stills Feels Good,The CD isn't as good as I had anticipated; but nothing to do with the service I recieved. It was great experiece shopping on line.Thanks
1,Unique Theological View,The Watchtower uses the 192 page books as 'Bible study aids'. Each books of these type teach the unique theology taught and approved by its governing body. It is less of a Bible study and more of tool to change a person's past understanding of scripture (whether their view was accurate or not) and replace it with the Watchtower teachings.The official teachings have changed countless times over the 150 year history of this religious movement. This one reflects the view current with the date of publication. I rated it one star because of the durability of the older Watchtower products. Many people collect these books for whatever reason.
2,Modern art?,"Mix of bulling, violence and simply psycho, enchanted with soft sex at astonishing level hardly leaves anyone indifferent to this low-budget movie."
3,"Disgusting, disturbing and revolting family...","Visitor Q displays a fountain of extremely bizarre and disturbing human behaviors that can be thought of as an outcome of severe mental illness and deficiency in societal responsibility. This is done through a psychotic dysfunctional family amidst an emotionally repressed society where youth are taught moral values through media produced by adults lacking those same moral values. The film displays numerous revolting scenes that should alarm and disgust the audience, since most are beyond what is considered abnormal. The message is easily missed under the traumatizing scenes, but it rides underneath the horror of the characters daily lives. Thus, I must recommend everyone who is sensitive not to see this film, but I know that human curiosity cannot stop those who are curious. However, know that you have been warned."
3,its kinda like the exorcist,"So the first thing you see is this dude doing his daughter and the last thing you see is like that dudes wife spraying her milk across the room and peeing onthe floor like in the Exorcist while that dude is outside in the greenhous like having sex with a dead chick.Yeah, its just as good as it sounds. i laughed real hard like the whole time its funnier than Bio Dome, you know. It's like the time when i told my friend to rent bio Dome but he rented some movie called Airplane instead? and i was all ""Dude, where's biodome and he was all ""airplane's funnier than Bio dome dude"" and we watched Airplane and when it was over i was like ""dude that was so not funnier than bio dome"" and he was all ""Shut Up Tad!"" and were not freinds anymore.Faschcist. I hate fascists."
1,Don't waste your time with this nonsense,"Although slightly disturbing and gross, this film is fairly pointless and boring. I love original and somewhat strange films, however this film (despite the ongoing incest and other taboo behavior throughout the film) is senseless and almost boring. In fact I could barely sit through the entire movie, not because it was disturbing, but rather because I was about to fall asleep! I understand the concept completely, but I don't find that it helps in the least...I do agree with one thing in other reviews, the quality of this film is very poor. However I would also add that the acting is also atrocious! Overall, I would never recommend this film to anyone, unless perhaps they were suffering from sleep depravation!"
2,Not as good as I hoped,"Unfortunately, this movie is just a jumble of family based atrocities. Make a list of taboos, then one-by-one, cross them off as the movie proceeds. Things happen, so I guess that counts as plot, but not really ""theme"", unless finding new lows is ""theme"".I had absolutely no sense that this was a real family, that there was any kind of familial relationship, or even basic human caring. Of course, undoing taboos involves seeing the destruction of what the taboos are supposedly intended to protect, so lacking any normal foundation, tearing at the fabric of a fake family was just rending.These points could have been made more effectively with a stronger base and a more subtle application of the violation of social norms. Peeling the onion, as it were.Instead we get a shotgun blast of violence and ludicrous behavior. Not the best work we've seen."
4,What the %$#^@#,"Well, I thought I knew what to expect after viewing my first few movies by this director, but little did I know....This is just weird, but wonderful! I love watching a movie and never having the slightest clue what could be coming around the next corner. I highly recommend this movie and any others by Miike, but if you are like me, one or two will not be enough. I find myself searching every web site and store looking for all of his movies...Happy hunting!!"
3,Missing something important,"This book has calories, fat, carbs, chol, and sodium but NOT protein. If that is not important to you, it is a good guide."
2,disappointing,"not as compehensive as I'd have liked, info is years old....doesn't have all the national locations covered...bummer"
5,A remarkable and true story about aviation history,"The Amazing Air Balloon by Jean Van Leeuwen is a remarkable and true story about aviation history set back in 1784 colonial America, when for the first time a hot air balloon was flown with a human passenger, -- who happened to be a thirteen-year-old boy. Evocative oil paintings by Marco Ventura showcase the narration to mark The Amazing Air Balloon as a truly wonderful picture book account of ambition and dreams come true."
2,VERY basic!,"Wow! If you want a very basic genealogy program, this is it. No frills at all. Good thing it was on clearance at Staples! I'll pay a little more and get FTM!!"
3,"Decent, but has a few flaws","On the positive side, you can set this up for either a 1 or 2-minute record time per call. It does have a nifty female voice with a british accent. On the negative side, I don't like the fact that it thanks each caller for their call AFTER they have hung up. What's up with THAT? And the rotary volume control is already defective after only having it a few months. All in all, not too bad, but just watch out for defects that pop up shortly after using it."
2,all the songs don't play,the number seven and eight won't play all the way through. They lock up about half the way through. I want to return them.
5,Just a pure cup of Java with an extra lump of fun!,"Simply THE BEST book to learn Java and object oriented programming. The concise examples and easy to follow instructions set all other Java books = null; Advanced topics are made simple with helpful and fun examples such as, ""NoCockroaches!"". Java Programming Today even includes the Java Development Kit and one of the best programming editors out there. Everything you need to get started is in this book."
5,AN EXCELLENT DEBUT,"This book was the best book I've read in a very long time. There was not one boring moment. I like the way she developed each character. something I find to be a problem with most new authors. I enjoyed the book so much to the point where I thought about a sequel. Immediately, I erased those thoughts, thinking that the sequel may not be that good without the the main character. Seing how brilliant this author is, I'm sure she'll come up with some bright Ideas for the sequel, perhaps make it it even better than LL&L. I am definitely looking forward to it."
4,AMUSING...,THIS BOOK KEPT ME READING EVERY MOMENT I HAD A CHANCE BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE HOW FAR THESE CHARACTERS WOULD GO AND WHAT TWISTS THE PLOTS WOULD TAKE...TOWARDS THE END I FELT THAT IT HAD GONE A LITTLE TOO FAR WITH THE INTRO OF LYRIC'S SISTER (YOU'LL HAVE TO READ THE BOOK TO KNOW) BUT OVERALL I WAS IMPRESSED BY THE BOOK AND HAVE ALREADY LET SOMEONE BORROW IT...GOOD READING.
2,"OKAY... there are much better ones. Few options, poor display.","This laptop was purchased as a gift for my daughter when she was 2. She really couldn't use it at that age, so we put it up until she got older. Now at age 4 she does use it occassionally, but it doesn't hold her interest. It has a poor display, few play options, and is just difficult to navigate. It has music play which just makes a few keys act like a keyboard, letter play (this is her favorite because it has a spelling option) and number play. She gets bored quickly and my younger son usually just ends up banging on the keyboard. She has a newer more updated Barbie laptop now that has many more features and holds her interest much longer. Don't pay the inflated price this guy on the Amazon marketplace is asking. If you pay more than twenty bucks for this thing, you'll be sorely disappointed."
3,"It works, has everything i need.","All of the products do what they should, the fret polisher which is pretty much a piece of very fine grit wetsand paper worked wonders on an old strat copy i had with crusty frets. The cloths suck, pick up some better cloths and just use the ones in the kit for applying the polish or something"
4,Good guitar goop,"Received five fluids and two cleaning cloths, but neither instructions nor the fret-polishing sandpaper. Not quite worth returning the set for that; I can figure out the instructions from the web (or guess, which is close enough) and score some fine abrasive paper from the hardware store when and if I think I need it. The fluids all seem to do what they are supposed to."
1,Stereotypes never work and aren't funny,"I thought this was going to be a fun look at American life, and some of it was, but the vast generalizations of Americas were supposed to be humorous but I found them inaccurate and insulting."
2,Boring book,"Ciao America! is Beppe Severgnini's follow-up book to Ciao Italia!He should have quit while he was ahead. Ciao America is supposed to be a witty account of Severgnini's year spent in America. However, it's not funny, nor is it witty. The book is composed mostly of the author's day to day experiences of living in America and his wry observations of those experiences. The problem is that the book is as mundane as the author's year in America. It's not funny, it''s not witty, it's not interesting and it's not worth reading."
5,Nothing tho Fuss About,"Nestle, the parent company to Nespresso and the coffee pods, is the worlds largest distributer of coffee, with Nescafe having the greatest world wide brand recognition. Its not like I worry about Nestle and it's coffee drying up and blowing away. I first experienced Nespresso as a guest in a friends home. It was simply the best coffee I ever drank. The machine is ready to dispense in 40 seconds. I turn it on, reach for a cup, make my coffee choice and push the lever. Coffee is in my cup in under a minute and a half from hitting the on button. I like ""Goldilocks"" coffee, not too hot and not too cold. I can begin to sip and enjoy this amazingly rich and nurturing brew without any extra steps or clean up."
4,The best if you can't find the Ultra Vita/Min,"I first found these at a local wellness shop and have been looking for an equal replacement since the shop stopped carrying the brand. These come in capsule form making them easier to absorb than other brands' pressed vitamin tablets, even those labeled ""easy to digest.""The best product Nature's Purest makes is the Ultra Vita/Min formula, but it's difficult to find online for purchase. The Ultra Man is a good compromise. If you do your research you'll find that Nature's Purest has added vitamins and minerals into the capsules that the other necessary ingredients may flush out of your system.I definitely recommend."
5,Absolutely the Best!,"I wonder if the people who wrote negative reviews about this CD really understood Beethoven. Have you heard any of his symphonies? Beethoven is about dynamism! Maybe they should stick with Mozart.Ashkenazy gave a flawless performance. And technically the CD is very well recorded, fully exploiting the dynamic range available on the CD format, very finely mastered.I consider this a golden classic worth collecting."
3,Only okay.,Not as well done as I expected. Now I wish I had looked for Lang Lang's version of these pieces.
2,DISAPPIONTING!,"I read Flee and I thought it was very disappionting. I never would have imagined what happened at the end could happen, but I was sadly mistakin. I when I finished the book I want to throw my book away, but I resisted the urge to do so. I liked whay happened at the begining, but I didn't like how Ed and Gaia are sort of becoming more than friends if you know what I mean. I first started to absolutly dislike this book, but now I feel sort of numb. I don't really hate this book, but I don't exactly love it either. I just realized that there are more important things to worry about than some HIGHLY OVER RATED BOOK!"
4,Wow...,"Like many other readers out there, I thought the book was kind of slow at first... and it is. It basically just reiterates what's been happening during the past couple of books.I can't believe what happened to Sam, first of all. I was so angry, because I thought they should be together, but I'm glad that Gaia finally realized that he wasn't intentionally trying to dis her.Second of all, Loki is so sick. I can't believe what he has planned. That's so freaky.I am so sick of Tom and his whining. I really am. He just says the same thing over and over... yeah, we know you miss your ""beloved"" Gaia. Do something about it then. You could've at least left a note semi-explaining things to the girl.I want Ed and Heather to be together. I hope he understands what Heather is going through...Josh is so creepy. I hated whenever he called Sam, ""Sammy."" I don't know... something about that seriously bugged me.I can't wait to read ""Love."" I want to know how Francine is going to wrap it up... I hope it's good."
4,Helpful!,"So much insight given in this book, I found it extremely encouraging and helpful in my journey and would highly recommend it as one of the best books I've read on homosexuality."
4,This is a message that is not out there much!,"This is a book for singles that is not out there too much. It challenges singles to use their singleness to advance the cause of Christ with all of the extra time we have by not having children & spouses. The world's message is to live to please yourself, but this book - like the Bible - challenges us to live to know,serve, and please God."
4,This one makes you think. I'd recommend it!,"This book has a lot of good stuff in a little book. It'd get 5 stars, but its too small."
3,Another Speer Bio that Falls Short of Sereny's,"Like Dan van der Vat's biography, ""The Good Nazi: The Life and Lies of Albert Speer"", Joachim Fest's work, ""Speer: The Final Verdict"" is a largely unnecessary offering that simply rehashes the old debate about Hitler's armaments minister.Gitta Sereny's superb biography, ""Albert Speer: His Battle with Truth"" remains the standard work on Speer and will no doubt remain so for a long time to come. Both van der Vat's and Fest's work pale in comparison. The only thing that makes Fest's Speer biography truly compelling, and allows it to trump van der Vat's, was his personal involvement with the subject. Fest and Speer worked together on editing Speer's memoirs in the late '60s. A few personal glimpses of Speer appear in this work, but one wishes Fest had written his own memoir of working with Speer instead.For the comprehensive Speer biography, check out Sereny's work first."
5,Read this book!,"I cannot remember the last time a book - an actual book - made me laugh so much. Nor can I remember the last time a book has lingered in my mind long after I've read it. Stupid and Contagious was a pleasant surprise in the summer of 2006. The Generation X-ers, Y's and Echo Boomers have another author to be proud of. A big congratulation goes out to Caprice Crane on a very well written first novel. Ms Crane, could arguably be compared to Tina Fey or Amy Heckerling. The book is not stupid, but after the first chapter, it is very contagious. Ms Crane creates brilliant dialogue for the two protagonists or should I say the two antagonists, almost as if Ms Crane has an insight into the inner emotions of the younger generation (anybody under 40). If you are a fan of such movies as The Wedding Crashers or The 40 year old Virgin, or if you're a fan of the Romantic Comedies of the past, such as Hepburn and Grant's Bringing Up Baby or the Philadelphia Story, this book is for you. Enjoy!"
4,Quirky and breezy read,"This is one of those books that is easy to read in one session. The format of having one chapter from Heaven's perspective, then one chapter from Brady's perspective is effective in keeping things interesting and moving the story along.I loved that both of the main characters did not fit into the typical chick lit cookie-cutter mold.Between the format of the book and the characters themselves, this book stands out from other books in the same genre."
4,Amusing,"This book was a cute story, although there were many moments when I wondered if the lead female character was age 13 due to the rather stupid things she did. All in all, not a bad book."
5,A Must Read!,"Stupid and Contagious is one of those rare books that comes along when you least expect it to remind you what a good book is supposed to be like. Once you start reading it, you'll have a tough time putting it down. It's easy to relate to the two main characters, Heaven and Brady, because Ms. Crane make them so true to life. There's nothing gimicky here, no fluff, and no filler. One of the best things about the book is that it's told from two different perspectives, Heaven's and Brady's. It's almost like Ms. Crane lets us into a secret club where we get to see what the opposite sex is thinking. I really enjoyed Ms. Crane's take on the music business and pop culture, which is interlaced throughout the storyline. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you might even get a hankering for a can of Tab by the time you're done reading. If you buy this book you definitely won't be disappointed."
5,Awesome,"I remember when i was younger, this used to be my favorite TV show. Therefore when i saw DVDs of it on amazon just recently, i just had to buy it. Even though i'm now a teenager, i still absolutely love watching this show."
5,Excellent line of cordless phones,"I bought the next one up 937A which is exactly the same except that it includes a speaker phone ability on the handset(it works great and is crisp and clear with good volume and no need to shout to be heard either). I used to have a SBC cordless that never worked properly, this is an excellent phone in every way and even CR gives it high marks. I can take the handset across the street to a park and walk at least a 1/4 mile(probably more) in to the park with trees over head and I can still make a very clear phone call(great for walking the dog or just relaxing in the park on a sunny day, no need to bring my cell phone), and the base is in my apartment on the 12th floor. I love this phone. It is a good value too."
2,They squeak badly.,"They are good as walking shoes go, I like the width and length is true. The only drawback is they squeak very badly when walking."
2,"Watch the size, may be off","I had great experiences with another shoe made by Saucony, the Saucony Jazz. It still remains the most comfortable shoes I have ever had. I took a chance on this different line of shoe, but unfortunately the size is not good for my feet. Although I ordered the same size as I had with the Jazz shoes, and they fit me perfectly, this shoe seems to run a little small and narrow at the toes. I can tell they are pretty comfortable in terms of cushioning and support, but they hurt my feet and cramped my toes, even after trying to break them in for two weeks. Basically, I will be unable to wear these on account of the bad sizing, so it turned out to be a waste of money."
4,"Not the most innovative, but pretty good.","I actually think this is a pretty good Lake of Tears Album. Not as good as Black Brick Road or Neonai, but nonetheless enjoyable. Favorite songs include Purple Sky & Like a Leaf."
5,State Property,I benn looking for this album for a long time. Thank you so much. I can't turn it off now.
3,s-t-a-t-e-p-r-o-p-e-r-t-y,"when you doubted and didn't think beanie sigel's boys would come out hot, you was proved wrong. this album is blazing hot, and not mainstream or commercial rap at all. this album is so hot, even though its so street/gangsta rap, it still managed to come out with a music video. the video that they came out with was probably one of the hottest if not the hottest track of 2002...Roc the mic. beanie sigel and freeway teamed up in roc the mic and they flowed over a real laid back hot beat. roc the mic was the perfect formula lyricially and the beat to be a hot track. the rest of the album, the boys of state property attempt to shine and show people their mc skills. not to many other standout tracks, but their is...to tell you the truth, if this album is not in your collection, then you should get it."
2,Poor Sound,Comedy is great but sound quality is very very poor. I am returning this to Amazon for credit it's so bad.
4,absolutely nutsy fun,"This book was wild. The love scenes were stirring, and the plot was so way out, it sounded like an old movie/Shakespearean role-switching extravaganza. The setting is the French Revolution, which is hardly humorous, but this book was full of humor. I have never read a romance quite like this-- the heroine is brave, the hero is almost disregarded in the beginning, although I knew his identity only 1/4 of the way through it. It's sort of a Zorro plot (although not quite that either), in which the characters are hiding their identities by day and emerging at night seeking justice as well as profit. It's a complete fantasy, but that's why it's so much fun."
4,"Excellent Randomness...Just Like His Band, Phish","Having been a fan of Phish for several years, it's hard not to be critical of their accomplishments. Only those who enjoy the absurd and those who seek to understand it will fully enjoy it. Some of his snippets make for good bedtime stories for the kids."
2,Junk,"I bought this toy for my 3-year old son in June of this year and it has already fallen apart with very little use. The chain falls off and doesn't stay on, so he gets really frustrated trying to ride it. We are in the process of trying to get a refund! Don't waste your money...."
5,fun for tractor enthusiast,My 3yr old received this tractor as a gift and he absoulty loves it. The pedal did come off same with other reviewers but he can still pedal easily without it. We also have the peg perego motorcycle and I like the tractor better because it is a pedal toy. This gives his little legs a workout and wears him out. The battery powered toys only wear out mom and dad who are walking alongside.
5,Very pleased!,"I bought this tractor for my little boy on his first birthday. I worried that he would be too small for it but he absolutely loves it!! I have to start him pressing the petal but once he gets going he can keep pressing it. My 4 year old daughter loves it as well, although it does seem that she is a little too big for the tractor. It is pretty small and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone older than 3 only due to size. The battery lasts a long time between charges. Great for the price!"
4,"Not a light read, esoteric, good for Pali buffs.","This is Wheel Publication #21. A translation of the Vitakka Santhana Sutta by Soma Thera. The original text itself, supposedly spoken by the Buddha, is probably from the Majjhima Nikaya. This translation can probably be found on line but here it is in print in about 30 pages.This book is not a light read, it is rather esoteric. The title is a little misleading. It would not be considered the best approach to this problem by many of today's psychiatrists or vipassana teachers. Still, it is a good historic text, and anyone interested in the Pali Texts, vipassana, and/or Theravada Buddhism would enjoy it."
3,Mediocre funk at best....,"I don't normally write reviews...I'm not an expert or anything, but I know what I like. Just know that there are far better funk comps out there. Try anything by James Brown or for ""new"" old school funk sounds try the Funky Funky series (Funky Funky Detroit, Chicago...), Jazzman's Funk series (Florida Funk,...) or any of a number of New Orleans Funk/R&B compilations, including the likes of the Meters or Dr. John. For that matter, try Sharon Jones & the Dap Kings for awesome NEW soul and r&b. But this comp sounds like watered-down James Brown retreads (the first song shamelessly rips from ""Cold Sweat"") or that generic late 60's/early 70's funk sound. The middle tracks are OK, but nothing that can't be missed...save yer money and get Soul Jazz Records' New Orleans Funk or any of the Super Breaks cds for truly funky (and heavily sampled) sounds..."
1,Lasted 30 minutes,"My miniature schnauzer loved the kyjen fling-it pig, and had it for 2 years before it broke. I decided to replace it with the squirrel version but it wasn't nearly as sturdy as the pig, and my dog had the tail off within half an hour. After this he wasn't interested, as it's the pull-out action that keeps his attention. I'm going back to the pig!"
2,Maybe not for small dogs...,My pug Ginger got this for xmas and the toy is cute but she can't get her mouth around the toy's belly because it has the retractable reel inside it for the squirrel's tail. I don't have a lot of room inside to really through this guy around but maybe outside it would fly farther because I'd have room to really fling it. I am keeping an eye on her when she does play with it because the string from the tail might tangle up or snap. You never know.
4,59 1/2 Minutes,"An entertaining look back at some of the characters interviewed on television since the 1950s by veteran 60 Minutes correspondent Mike Wallace. Like most TV people who try to write memoirs, Wallace struggles a bit to translate his experiences into the print medium. Consequently, one is left wishing for more substance. Many of the interview transcripts fall curiously flat. But when one watches the same material on the accompanying DVD, voila! It comes alive. It's astonishing to see many of the historical figures Wallace encountered, especially during the 1950s when some were nearing the end: Frank Lloyd Wright and Thomas Hart Benton, in particular. Vladimir Horowitz is also a revelation. The book is well worth perusing."
4,A must have,Working 12 hour shifts as an intensive care nurse I often developed back pain and lower abdomen strain. I bought and used this with my first son and it was a lifesaver! It eased my back pain and relieved the cramping sensation I would get in my lower abdomen if I stood or walked to long. I am now pregnant with my second child and needed a new support (old one was just worn out) and decided to purchase the Mom-EZ support instead. It had EXCELLENT concept of very easy application and easy adjustment but it really scratched my back alot even with padding. I ended up returning it and getting another one of the Loving Comfort supports. It's not as easy to apply as the Mom-EZ or to adjust but it is much more comfortable to wear.
2,Not a dental Tool,"This product should have a more clear description to say that it is for working and anything other than your mouth. I would not feel comfortable using these tools in my mouth. They have a steel/aluminum look, not polished/shiny like other dental tools that I have used in the past. Use it for ceramics and other projects but not for your mouth."
5,Best Game Ever-First Review Online,"Quite simply the best game I've ever played. This is my first review online, I did a pc search for best online rated games and this one came up--want to add mine to keep it there.The planescape universe combines the best elements of all rpg worlds. If you loved warcraft, starcraft, black isle games--now obsidian games this is the best of the best.The marketing of this game was bad...the name and the guy on the cover could put alot of people...especially parents off. But, this cult classic deserves the reviews it gets."
1,player's torment,"this game is a real turkey. 1. the theme is goulish, almost disgusting; 2. the pace is extremely slow; 3. the player options are poor. Also, it "" eats "" memory out of your computer. I have nothing good to say about this game."
5,"Still An Outstanding Game, Everytime I play",One of the best games anyone could get their hands on!Each time you play you can choose a diffrent route to explore!A must have for any RPG player (or in my case an x-RPG player)I am most disapointed that there is no sequal.
5,Torment the soul,"This game was pretty awesome...I picked it up because it was cheap even though I have never heard of it before.It has a good storyline that kept you interested in what more you could learn about the mysterious character that you play. Torment kept giving you little pieces of your memory as certain events or items triggered them. An interesting concept. The graphics and sound were impressive, as was the witty humor from the floating skull(pretty funny).In all, it was very well thought out sleep devouring game that kept you in the dark and action for most of the gameplay."
5,Atmosphere Atmosphere Atmosphere,"It's been a long time, since Darklands I think, since a game has immersed me in atmosphere as rich as Planescape: Torment. This game is truly worth your time and effort, though it is, as all great games are, too short -- at least in my opinion. Those people who hunt for the ""best of the best"" equipment may be disappointed, as I didn't manage to find any armor for my character or even a simple missle weapon. The focus of the game is more on character interaction, and there is LOTS of it. The problem with this is that you'll really have to skim the dialog for the gist of what's being said rather than fully appreciating the skill that went in to constructing the conversations."
4,Welcome to camp nightmare. By Jacob,Your Nightmares about camp are coming true in the book Welcome To Camp Nightmare by RL Stine. In this book a boy named Billy gets to camp and many strange things start to happen. Billy is shocked when the camp has no nurse. Uncle Al does not care if he loses campers. Billy's friends start to disappear and he is worried about them.I was not impressed with the ending to this book but I still think it is a great book. If you like aliens then you will like the end to Welcome to Camp Nightmare.I recommend this book Welcome to Camp Nightmare to readers 9-13 years old. It is a wonderful book. If you read this book I am sure you will enjoy it.
2,Disappointed,"I bought this phone last week and had high expectations because of all the positive reviews I read on it. I'm probably not going to keep this phone because of the noticeable ""echo"" it has even when I turn the volume all the way down on it. I don't know if the echo has to do with the DSS technology but it seems I hear it in almost every phone I've tried that has this technology. If you don't mind the echo on this phone than you probably will like it, but for me it drives me crazy."
3,New Dimensions,"I was expecting a little more from this DVD, as I'm not a newcomer to the bass. For some reason I expected lessons that would be a bit more intense. A lot of this would be more suited to beginners.In saying that, though, there are some good techniques taught, such as Doug's False Harmonic & Flamenco Slap. I was hoping for a little more focus on right-hand slap & pop technique, but this was somewhat lacking.Still, I did learn some new things, so by & large it was worth the price to me."
4,Good Bass Method,"If you like to start playing bass guitar it's useful to learn how to create your own style. This method shows how to play bass guitar and explore new sounds, adding effects and techniques to get a leading sound from your bass."
2,Interesting Tale Poorly Delivered,"The history of the USSR's influence on black radicalism in the USA is an interesting one. And Baldwin's choice of 4 prominent black activists/artists to illustrate this is an efficient vehicle for this purpose. However, the author's dense, academic writing style leaves one bleary eyed after a few pages. Needless repetition just exacerbates the teadiness. I found the chapter on Robeson the best just necause she refrained from turgid literary analysis as she had with McKay, Hughes and DuBois, but then, those dudes were writers and Robeson a singer. She does make legitimate observations about the similarities and disparities between the Soviet and Black experiences but I would have liked more hard-core history of these individuals' personal struggles with racism and government oppression. The book would have benefited from a non-academic editor and being half its current size."
2,No where near enough pictures.,I have to agree with the review by Fine Homebuilding magazine. The author seems to know his stuff but does not convey the information effectively without pictures.
2,not absorbent enough,"It's ok, but not as absorbent as cotton, and the main purpose is of course to absorb sweat. This is because it is polyester"
1,Still Missing,"I ordered this harness on 12/16 and as of today, 1/18/07, it still has'nt been shipped"
4,TummySupport,"I bought this a little late post-pardum, however, I'm trying to make it work. It's definitely more comfortable than some of the girdles you'd find at popular lingerie stores, but the velcro wrap is a bit of a nuisance. After wrapping it around your belly,it does work in smoothing your stomach out and making it appear flatter, however under clothing, you normally see the velcro overlay sticking out - it does not lay down flat. Size won't make a difference, it's just the way it's designed. But besides that it seems to keep your tummy flatter looking even after you take it off - which in essence is the whole point."
2,Just plain Bad,This album just plain sucks. It has none of the energy that I expect from anything with Frankie's name on it. I wouldn't buy this album again ever. I spent 18 on this cd and listened to it just once. Now it sits on my desk collecting dust.
5,This is simply the set of Quartets to own,"It is said that when Schubert was about to die, he asked to listen to Beethoven's Op 131 for the very last time. Listen to this magnificient recording and you'll see why such a genius was so impressed and always felt not to have come close to Ludwig von's masterity. The other 9 discs are well filled of music which flows from a sublime soul. I'd rather own the entire set of Quartets than split them between ""early"" and ""late"" ones. Any way you can, make sure you have this opus in your collection."
5,"a must for people called to walk the path of healer,","since I have become ""spiritually awakened"" and directed towards the path of healer I have been enlightened by Caroline's thoughts in regard to spiritual madness for they will ring true to the soul essence of those called to ""carry the light"" to others, a must listen for those ""newly connected"" to the lovelight of the divine!"
3,What does this mean?,"Caroline Myss does have some spiritual insights to share, but in this rambling, impromptu talk she often sounds like she is a little tired and fed up, and is chiding us. She also keeps bringing up the question ""what does this mean?"" as if she is about to explain a term she is talking about, but then fails to do so. Not the most inspiring."
5,"Excellent, Fresh, and Incredibly Valuable","Caroline Myss hits the bullseye with this audio CD. No other lecture and information (that I've ever been exposed to) deals with the topic of ""spiritual crisis"" as this does! Timely, provocative, and a real life-saver. This spoke to me in volumes. I feel honored to have this as a resource."
4,"Pretty Good, Nothing Amazing","I thought this book was ok. It caught my attention pretty well. There are a lot of similarities between the characters and characters from previous VC books. i.e. Jade and Teal Robin's life and Melody's life. I think the GW needs to just sit down and think up one really good ceative idea then run with it under his/her own name. I am looking forward to the sequel, Midnight Flight though. Although, I'm sure it'll have an evil administrator and the girls will band togeather to get through whatever they need to get through and we'll have another happy ending."
1,"Really, really bad...","What can I say about such a book except that it was really, really bad? Abysmal. Personally, if it were up to me, I would have put a stop to this 'dragging VC's name through the mud' a long time ago. She was a wonderful writer when she was alive, and this ghostwriter should just quit writing. They should just put her name to rest before it gets any worse.What's the book about? It's just about a bunch of whiny girls who are born to be bad. I'm through Teal's story now, and I'm struggling to drag myself through Phoebe's, it's that boring. Teal was just a whiny brat, Robin...well, I hate to say this, but her sarcasm wasn't witty one bit, nothing like Melinda Sordino from Speak or Holden Caulfield in Catcher in the Rye. She came off as just bratty. I'm sorry, but this is one of the worst books I've read in a long time, and I read a lot.I wouldn't recommend this to anybody. You'd get more from staring at the wall twiddling your thumbs than you would from reading this book."
1,A vicious cycle...,"The ONLY good thing about it was that there were no annoying letters by other ""VCA Heriones"" to try to get you to buy ""their"" book. If someone like, say, Willow, were to write the girls saying, ""I think we are truly sisters of the heart. It takes my breath away! Please read my books!"" I would scream! Rip my hair out! Burn the books! As it is, I am very annoyed and refuse to read another VC ghostwriter book again. What ""startling surprise"" did we get here? What ""new characters""? Every VC ghostwriter character is EXACTLY the same with different looks, though I find similarities from all the grls all the time The difference here is these girls whine as they're doing drugs and running away! 0 stars for me!"
4,Yes and no...,"This was actually one of the better 'VCA' books that Neiderman had published in a while. Unlike the last few books before this, I actually enjoyed Broken Wings. The stories of the girls were believable. It really is too bad that its sequel, Midnight Flight, was actually one of the WORST 'VCA' books that Neiderman ever published..."
3,Pretty good,"Let me start off by saying that I'm glad that the author decided to put all the girls stories in one book, instead of using four (or in this case it would have been 3) different books. Also, these characters are a nice change of pace from the usually VCA girls who are weak goody-two-shoes. It's good to see VCA girls that aren't so perfect, and doing bad things for no true purpose. Robin's story is the best, and although Teal's story is good she comes across as a ""poor little rich girl"", Phoebe's story kinda dragged on, although it was shorter then the other two stories. I guess the author got bored with it and decided to wrap it up quickly. For the most part this book is really good, the reason I gave it 3 stars was because I thought the prologue was unnecessary, and Phoebe's story didn't hold my attention at all."
2,Too little - too basic and incomplete,"This book spends too much time explaing computer operation (pull down menus, command keys) and not enough on Finale. Too often as it gets close to having some depth it says ""but this is beyond the scope of this book, read your Finale manual."" The one page index is worthless. The book does things like wastes 4 pages on a windows/mac keyboard comparison chart and yet does not show how to setup notating a drum kit. If this is your first piece of software, maybe it would be helpful, but if you think it gives insight and tricks beyond your manual, forget it. I feel cheated. I found some mistakes in the book and certainly the title ""mastering"" is an overstatement."
2,"Neat idea, but...","...it just doesn't translate very well into a game. It was brave of the developers to do a game with a movie-style plot that flows like a movie and you actually control how successful someone performs an action, or whether someone asks this question or that. But ultimately, the plot is shoddy at best, the dialogue on par with George Lucas' recent work, and you can't see much of anything because you have to play games of Simon to advance the plot.I tried to make the most of it, I really did. Maybe it was too ambitious, maybe it need to be better written. But that's my take on it."
4,Love this product because it is organic and unsweetened.,So very glad that Amazon.com sells Let's Do Organic Shredded Unsweetened Coconut. I make sugar-free coconut macaroons so this works perfectly. I have a blood sugar problem and coconut helps me control it. I do wish it weren't so finely shredded though.
4,Book title is BIG BUNNY,The book arrived as advertised--in Good condition and on time.As for the book's story I'm enjoying it very much. Hefner truly leads a charmed life--if not a total fantasy. Very rare in this day and age. I've enjoyed PLAYBOY for many years and now I'm able to learn about the behind the scenes activities.I look forward to further purchases from your library.Thank you
4,4 Gold Stars for The Black Squall,"Lori Stone's work is a lot of fun. Sure, I have some editorial quibbles about it, and it's not exactly Tolstoy, but it's a great effort to keep alive the tradition of a very famous adventurer. I think any fan of McGee and Meyer would enjoy this book. I'm looking forward to Ms. Stone's next publication!"
3,Great Network Walkman - Terrible Software,"I really like this walkman - especially the small size, large memory, and long battery life. I use it almost every day on the long commute to work, or when I'm in the gym. So why only 4/5? The styling looks cool, but the whole unit would be smaller if the ""hold"" mechanism was smaller. Also, I find the ""jog dial"" thing that you use to change tracks sometimes sticks and doesn't feel very robust. In addition, the music management software - Sonic Stage - is really poor.(3 months later)No, I take that back. The Sonic Stage software is terrible - it has the usability and reliability of a 2nd year computer science project. Sony's software support is equally bad: expect 3 week turnaround times on questions or problems.It's a shame - nice device, let down by appalling software."
1,Not very funny,"Don't be deceived by the other reviews. It's not funny.I now have a dvd to sell, but will feel bad if I con anyone into buying it.I don't think I can select a negative star rating, so it's getting a star."
3,ATRAC-3 is no longer SUPPORTED by sony,"Sony does not support atrac3 format. Only the MP3. So, why are you buying this outdated equipment? Are you a collector? Hope to sell it to Museum of Modern Music? Dah, it is outdated!!! Gone!! Sony does not make it anymore."
4,Judgment Day,"For the first time since September 1999, Undertaker is seen on WWF TV! Even though he does a dumb thing (costs the Rock the title in an Iron Man match against HHH, even though it's on accident) it's good to see him back. There's 5 other matches: Rikishi and Too Cool vs. Kurt Angle, Edge, and Christian, Eddy Guerrero vs. Dean Malenko vs. Perry Saturn, Big Show vs. Shane McMahon in a No DQ Match, Chris Benoit vs. Y2J in a Submission Match, and DX vs. The Dudleys in a Tag Team Table Match. The Iron Man match was kinda boring (I feel asleep under the announce table I was watching it from), which keeps it from getting 5 stars."
4,"Was there live, can't wait for the video","Going into JD, I was a bit miffed. It was my first PPV I was going to get to see live. I had paid $190 for 2 great seats in Freedom Hall and I was going to have to watch Triple H and the Rock stumble through an hour match. what a surprise though!As with any Iron match you have to pace your spots and Hunter and Rocky did it and did it well. The match was pretty entertaining and despite a few slow moments the two really managed to carry the match and make it good. The end was a little confusing, with the clock running out before the 'Taker got his spots in, but it was great return for the ""Phenom.""The card was also supported by a great Six Man Tag between Too Cool and Rikishi v.s Edge/Christian/Kurt Angle. Great match. Perfect way to start the show.Jericho/Benoit submission was a little slow, and the finish was even odder. But there were some great spots.Add in Mamacita and a Dudley Table match and you have yourself a pretty good pay-per-view!"
3,meh--go with Stronger Faster Healthier's Fish Oil,"Krill Oil is just all hype, with no actual gain over true high concentrated Fish Oil like Stronger Faster Healthier's. You get way more bang for your buck from that than you ever will with this."
1,BARF!,"I usually buy MegaRed Krill Oil softgels...have taken them for years with no problem. I bought the NKO because they were a bit stronger (and cheaper). Well, my first clue that these might be a problem was the hideous smell when I opened the bottle. I gave them anyway to my husband and myself, and the first day we were both seriously nauseous. I'm a real diehard, so I gave them to us a second time...with the same result...constant nausea. Never wanting to be accused of giving up too easily, I tried the NKO again a week later...queasy all day long, but no nausea on the days we didn't take these. I guess I will have to toss the remaining NKOs into the 'not fit for human consumption' pile...waste of good money. I'm going back to my non-nausea-causing MegaReds. Try whatever you want...just NOT the NKO!"
3,Source Naturals NKO - Neptune Krill Oil,"I decided to try these tablets at the recommedation of my Doctor due to an adverse reaction to fish oil. (I kept burping the fish oil) These tablets resolved the burping problem, but unfortunately caused me to have diarrhea. I do have a sensitive stomach, so it might just be particular to me. The price is fair, especially if you sign up for Subscribe and Save."
3,"The Good, the Bad and the Stinky","The bottle of this I received from Amazon smells very strongly of old shrimp. I hope it doesn't make me nauseated at some point. I've taken 2 of them for 2 days and from Day One Ive had very vivid, interesting dreams. Not bad ones; not all that great but I wonder if it's a sign of sleeping deeply? Last night I had two and both were long .I hope I can post a month from now or less with other side effects."
3,Did not help cholesterol.,"I have been taking this product with hopes it might lower my cholesterol. I am healthy but inherited high cholesterol readings around 240. Regular fish oil did help me for a while but the effectiveness wore off. I thought I would try this product after reading about it. I have taken 3 tablets per day for 4 months. I did nothing else different with diet, etc. My cholesterol has actually gone up during these 4 months. I don't think the tablets caused that but the tablets certainly did not help. I do like that these capsules are small and easy to swallow. They do have a bad smell when you open the container but I never had any side effects. Since they don't help with cholesterol, I don't anticipate I will continue taking them. I will probably go back to regular fish oil as it does help with my joints, particularly my knees. Will have to find some other remedy for cholesterol or go on a prescription."
2,Krill Oil did not help lower my cholesterol.,"I took this Neptune Krill Oil for 90+ days to see if it would lower my overall cholesterol. It had helped my friend significantly. Nope! My cholesterol was exactly the same 95 days after starting on the krill oil. I was taking two a day and it had no helpful effect at all. For the first 30 days it made me feel very tired. Tiredness is not listed as a common side effect, but you can certainly read other reviews indicating this as well. I'd stick to the regular, cheaper Omega 3 fish oil. Unfortunately, I can't honestly find any reason to continue taking this krill oil."
3,A little disapointed.,"Tried the Neptune krill Oil, and was pleased with supplement, but little dissapointed that the Neptune capsules are Bovine geletin softgels. Will be returning to Krill 500 plus from the World ABS brand. Theirs is little more expensive but it's the only company i can find who sell Krill oil in Fish geletin softgel capsules. Which is a bit essential if your a veggy!"
4,Excellent product,This is an excellent product at a good price. My friends report excellent results. I have only one mild complaint. I was hoping for a tasteless odorless product. To me the taste/smell of Krill in not much different than fish (which I hate). I am now taking flaxseed. I think this is an excellent product for most people just not for me.
5,It'll change your perspective on Hollywood's Bonnie & Clyde!,"This is some amazing reading! Milner covers every little detail and covers their lives chronologically. Every getaway, heist, route taken and shot fired is covered in this excellent crime bio. A real thriller. I couldn't stop reading it. One comes away with a new perspective on this deadly duo. Bringing in all the other members of the gang in various small holdups, it brings to focus that they were not like the Hollywood darlings on the screen, but cold-blooded and ruthless killers. They were akin to desperate rats hanging on day to day. Full of fast cars, bullets and blood, this is one of the finest crime accounts I've ever read. A real page turner and barn burner!"
1,Absolutely outrageous shipping charge,"The shipping charge for these hangers is $27.34. Once I put the order in, I was unable to take it back. I am furious. And there is no obvious way to contact Amazon customer service so I guess I'm just screwed."
3,This may help those of you have no disk message problem.,"After three months, I too had the problem that many have mentioned - no disc message. Here is what I have found helps to solve the problem.When the no disc message shows, unplug unit for about an hour. Immediately upon restoring power (I don't use batteries so might be a good idea to remove them), reset clock. Whenever power has been disrupted do the same. This worked for a while then the message showed again. After some research, I found out that it could be condensation on the lens. Now, everyday, I leave the disc door open for about an hour.So far, two months later, error message has not returned.Hope this helps."
2,Bummer,"It's cool, a beautiful watch indeed. However, it's much too thick almost cumbersome. For a ""Sporty"" watch, you'd think that it would be more sleek."
3,"Fun read, but repetitive and unstructured","I enjoyed this because college basketball is a minor obsession of mine. Any stroll down NCAA memory lane is alright with me. However, the actual writing of the Last Dance leaves much to be desired. The tales lack structure and Feinstein seems to haphazardly tell stories that may or may not fit the chapter's theme. He may also tell these tales more than once, causing you to scratch your head and flip a few pages back to make sure you aren't losing your mind.I read this on a ten hour flight so it served it's purposed of short term amusement. I wouldn't buy it again, however."
2,A Bit Repetitive,"A decent, quick read about March Madness and the Final Four. The depiction of the coaches meetings during the last weekend in March is what makes this a worthwhile work. Feinstein is, well, Feinstein."
3,"Beautiful, but...","I love theses. I have bought the whole collection for all the outlets in my place, but this one specially broke as my husband was screwing it to the wall. It was a shame to lose the money in a matter of seconds!"
1,Dud,"I guess I must have got a dud. If I push too hard while trying to scrape a sticker off my window, the blade retracts. There is absolutely no way to avoid this unless I push on the blade gently, which of course means that I don't get all the sticker residue off the window. I ended up holding the razor in my hand and doing a better job."
1,HYDE GLASS SCRAPER,"If you are lucky enough to have someone who can load the razor blade into position exactly right, you can use this scraper. It is very difficult to load the razor blade."
1,New Age Nonsense,"Having an interest in Game Theory, and also seeing the praise this book has received from reviewers, not least on this site, I opened this book with high hopes. Imagine my disappointment, therefore, on discovering that it is pure New Age-type drivel with a pseudo-philosophical style. Imagine my further disappointment on discovering that the book is a Trojan horse for encouraging spirituality or religious beliefs, specifically Christianity, although the author pretends to deny this.Don't be fooled by the references to Wittgenstein et al, this is altogether a mendacious piece of tripe which will appeal only to the feeble-minded."
4,Nice Color - High Price,Another crib product that looks nice and adds an air of sophistication to a baby's room but is priced too high.
4,Pure entertainment,"This is a beautiful but disturbing period film about an especially successful, especially tragic geisha. It is breathtaking, visually striking, funny, and intense at best... at its worst, there are moments that feel comically over-the-top, comically over-sensational. (Of course this WAS the '80s...) Those intrigued by the ""do they or don't they?"" mystery of geisha's sex lives will have a lot to chew on after watching this film. This is like ""Memoirs of a Geisha,"" but it felt much more ""Japanese,"" much more believable: raw, gritty, and unforgettably glamorous."
4,For the non ipod owners,"For the money, this little walkman is worth it. My gym is in the bottom floor of a condominium so the reception is not very good, but once outside it improves. It serves it's purpose.Sandra"
4,Pretty Good,"Excellent reception for a small radio. The headphone cord is the antenna - I have noticed that the FM reception is much better when I use headphones with longer cords. Unlike the Sony Sports Walkman, the volume control knob is tucked into the unit, which is nice so you don't accidently bump the knob and blow your ears out! Unit is lightweight and fits into a pocket easily. The weather band works horribly, however, but can be heard if the volume is turned way up.Overall, an impressive radio for the price."
3,Great radio except for,"This radio is SO sensitive it picks up other stations when I am moving around. Not sure how one would fix that. It is digital, so once on a station it should stay there, so perhaps this is a flaw. If I am not moving around much (which was why I got the radio!) the reception is excellent."
4,great walkman,"I love this walkman..I wish it had a seek button. You can't automatically go to the next strongest station, but I do like the five direct pre sets..very easy to use and quite convenient. When travelling find five stations you like and punch them in. Usually most people would find five sufficient. The AM reception is exceptional. The local distant switch is a help on FM, even though there is still multi-path interference in a city even with the local switch on.The size is great and I use it often when traveling. Highly recommended."
4,"Great walkman, poor headphones.","I love the fact that this product is simple and plays local tv channels. I can exercise outdoors to music or a program such as the Today Show. My only criticism is that the accompanying headphones are bulky. I would have paid more for a unit with small headphones, since I had to go out and buy them separately anyway."
2,My review of the Sony Walkman,"I use it anytime I'm on a walk alone, even a hike, or when working in the garden, sometimes for hours at a time. The fidelity isn't that great, but for listening to talk radio it does the job."
2,Not as good as you'd think,"I bought this radio after reading the other reviews that was listed for this item. I thought I was getting a good radio. Boy, was I wrong! In all fairness, the FM band is pretty good. I'm assuming that the AM band is good too (if I wanted to listen all day to talk radio). The TV band does not pick up the stations at all--no matter what I do. Also, what I really wanted the radio for was the Weather band so that I'd know what was going on when the power went out. Well, guess what--NO WEATHER BAND EITHER! Can't pick up anything!I feel that if I either wanted to listen all day to talk radio on the AM band or pick up a few stations on the FM band, this radio would have been great. But when you have bad weather coming in and you want to know what is coming your way, this definately is NOT the radio to get. I feel I have wasted my money on this purchase!"
2,A REALLY [bad] BLADE!!!!!,"this blade [is bad]!!! i bought it thinking, driggers are good blades and the master one would be awsome but it ended up only winning 4 out of 16 battles. it lost to every one of my blades, even a really [bad] one- dragoon fighter (my worst blade).LET IT RIP!!!"
5,My BeyBlade,"I always wanted a Drigger F because of its endurence, but thenI heard my friend found out about a new blade named Master Drigger. Then I bought my first blade M.D. I won 10/11 matches and on my 12 match to decide the best Blader on my block, my attack ring broke on the last hit (for some reason I still won). I dicoverd super glue could help for a while. And I`m now gonna try to start a team. LET IT RIP!!!!!!!"
4,Wonderful Illustrations Reinforce French Vocabulary,"My 5-year old daughter is fascinated with French and has pored over this book since receiving it for Christmas. Her French teacher thought it was one of the best she'd seen so we're donating a copy to the school as well. The bright, active illustrations are of animals playing sports, eating a meal at home, and other activities children can easily relate to. If your child likes French, this book will help him or her love it."
2,Boring,"I know it's difficult to discuss and review all of Europe in one book, but this book was boring. It was easy to read, but not very fun or interesting. It did hit the highlights of the major sights, but it acts more like a reference than an exciting guide."
4,BETTER THAN BOSE,"THE LOOK IS SLEEK, THE SOUND IS VERY, VERY GOOD. I AM SORRY I WASTED [$] ON THE BOSE CD/RADIO. THIS LITTLE SONY HAS ALL THE FEATURES I WAS LOOKING FOR."
4,Great cd/clock radio!,I just received this as a Christmas present and I have to say that I'm really happy with it.The alarm is not as obnoxious as a reviewer said it was. The radio gets good reception. I love both the Nap and Sleep features. The cd is great as well.All in all a pretty good product from Sony.
1,Stick on clock,I was sent WHITE clocks instead of the one pictured. I tried to return it but the company required a RA number and you could only call between certain hours. I also wasted $12.00 on shipping for some ugly white clocks. My car is black. I am very disappointed.
4,Maybe a bit stuck in the quag,"On first listen, this sounds about the same as last album, which, though that sound is a real good thing, nevertheless somewhat surprises me because I'd read it was supposed to sound more expanded. If their first LP also sounds like this, then I hope their intention isn't too much on the word ""quagmire"" in their name, but on ""from."" Keep on coming up, Dorothy and gang. A little more air next time?"
4,Typo in your title (sorry).,"I was browsing through Amazon, looking for some of my old-time favorites. When I came to Richard Brautigan I almost dropped my bisquit. It's Springhill Mine, not Mind, Disaster. Oh well, if we didn't make mistakes, I guess we'd all be deities."
3,In watermelon sugar,"I didn't really get this book, it still held my interest, don't get me wrong, but the book, for the most part, seems like random thoughs, included to take up space. I've heard the book is suppose to be some masterpieace of poetry, but this masterpieace I don't see. Not to say that there are not any poetic passages in the book, there are lots, and they show you many themes into the book. A good example of a poetic passage is in the ""my name"" chapter, where the author shows you that you don't need a name to fit into society. But a good example of wasted space in the book is the multiple chapters that they speak of the bat under the plank press.So if you like very abstract poetry, you should try this book, but if your not the type that can get poety, you should probly stear away from this book."
3,"I don't like Trout Fishing, however...","The other books in this collection are quite good. It's funny I got into a discussion with a local librarian whose favorites were ""trout fishing"", ""Confederate General at Big Sur"", and ""Hawkline Monster""... for me it is a totally different list. I noticed totally different things about his work, and that's the thing... Richard Brautigan paid attention to little details that made his work powerful. I enjoy the Pill vs. the Springhill Mine Disaster quite a bit. I also enjoyed in Watermelon Sugar, but these aren't my favorites... Nevertheless, enjoy!!"
5,Great for a tablet,"It is a great product. Solid and sturdy. I am using it for my Asus Transformer and it works pretty well. Very rugged design and the springs that are used are very powerful so the tablet for sure will never follow out. Also has soft plastic covers for the clamps so it won't scratch my tablet up.Only bad thing is that if there is no tension on the expandable clamp, it will rattle around."
3,bland,"The map is rather bland, and some of the labels are too big and end up off the true location. Seems to just be an older version reprinted. Could use updating."
4,"simple, clean, affordable","needed a affordable, simple wallmap for roadtrip planning. This met my needs."
3,"Good map, lousy packaging","The map itself is a good map, just what I wanted. The problem is the way it was shipped: rolled up without even a cardboard tube for support, then rolled up in a plastic mailing envelope. There was nothing rigid in the packaging from Office Quarters at all to keep the map from getting crushed/bent, and indeed it was crushed/bent in one spot. The map now has extra topographic features across the lower states, due to the wrinkles and creases. Why not put it in a poster tube??"
4,Ready to map an adventure!,I bought this map for the sole purpose of planning a three month RV trip across the country. This map is perfect.
3,Good value Oloong tea,"Pale color in cup. No grassy taste. Very mild oolong with little aroma. Easy tea to drink & enjoy in evening before bed. At a price of less than $20.00 per pound, it is a ggod value. Tea comes vacuum sealed in attractive cannister."
1,I'll be sticking with Marty Schwartz and GuitarJamz.com...,"I'll be sticking with Marty Schwartz - creator of GuitarJamz.com. It seems like the little independent guys online have far better quality material and teaching styles than these bigger brand DVD lessons ever will. Seems like they stick ""House of Blues"" on a lousy DVD and cash in instead of trying to make something that actually helps people learn, have fun, and play. That's big business for you.I've learned more for free on YouTube in 5 minutes than this DVD ever taught me."
5,Legendary Missa,"Solti's legendary 1978 Grammy Award winning Missa Solemnis - at this incredible price makes this CD a MUST BUY!!! It is a MUST for every serious Missa fan. Even if you have one hundred other Missa Recordings, this is a MUST!!!!Ths soloists are incredible and the Chicago Symphony Chorus is just that - the world's finest symphony chorus. Quite rightly so because the Chicago Symphony Chorus has earned more Grammys than any other SYmphony Chorus in the world.Buy it. You will never regret it."
1,Serious problems,"After having this camera for a couple of weeks I bought a CF card for it (it comes with built-in memory). Lexar media is one that is listed as compatible. When I inserted the CF card the camera would not turn on. After leaving it on for a long time it told me the CF needed formatting. It formatted the media and then the camera repeated the process of complaining about formatting. Since then the camera will not turn on reliably, gets confused about the media being there and randomly gives the complaint about the CF not being formatted. Compared to my Olympus camera experiences this camera is a definite no-no when it comes to anyone considering a 3mp digital camera."
1,The Camera Unreliable,I purchased the camera from HSN.com after watching the impressive demonstration. I it worked well at first. I added 256 MB flashcard and it got very quirkey. I sent it back and they replaced it with the same result. I used a different smaller flashcard and it worked OK for a short while. Then it started having problems capturing the shot. The shots would be fuzzy or completely black if they did register having taken. This is a camera I would advise everyone to keep away from based on my experience.
4,Greatly Enhanced,I bought this product looking for something to take me to the size that i have been wanting. as a gay male size matters! so after a month of taking this i noticed that my erections were harder and bigger. Let me tell ya i strongly recommend this product and i think your partner will as well..:)
4,Life is a banquet...,"Fabulous. This book is wonderful for true Patrick Dennis fans. I went through this bio and could pick events from Edward Tanner's life that made it into the books. I'm glad to find ""Lochby Court"" has been torn down, have been looking for it for years...This is a bittersweet tale as the life of Edward Tanner had many ""Upson Downs"" to it. Made me wish I knew the guy as a real person. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the author is trying to create a genre of fiction called ""camp"" and goes abit overboard on this...and gets abit tiresome in the process. Much of the action takes place where I live and have lived makes it all the more fun. Like Tanner's books, the bio is a ""slice of life"" to be enjoyed."
3,lackluster,"Dj X i un-f'n-believable live, but for some reason the only cd that he has ever made that is a standout is club 2000, since then he has been going slowly downhill on his cd's.But definately check him out live he will reset your jaw!"
1,Just a TRAILER - NOT THE MOVIE!,"This is a 2 minute trailer for the film ""Full Signal"", a documentary about the dangers of cell phone radiation. You're paying to watch a trailer - NOT THE MOVIE!"
4,Great sound easy to use,I was really surprised at how loud this radio can get. I have not had any problems with the radio and I absolutely love having it in reach without having to hop out of the shower!
2,Seems nice but doesn't last,"Purchased this shower radio for my daughter last Xmas and I am now back on Amazon looking for a replacement. Poor radio reception, difficult tuning, and lack of CD functionality we could live with, but unit affected buy moisture over time and turned ""moldy"" inside front tuning face plate. Radio quick working. CD player still works but sound quality if fuzzy. Really not the high quality product I have come to expect from Sony. Also unit quite heavy and bulky. Poor durability and quality for the price. Would not recommend."
5,"Very good product, worth the $$.","I bought this shower radio for my Fiance as a christmas present. I'm amazed at the sound quality and the battery life. Perfect so far for the last month. It is easy to use and setup. We only get like one or 2 radio stations in our bathroom, not surprising sine we live in an apartment with no outside windows in the bathroom. But the station we get is the one we like the most anyway. Easy to use, nice there is a clock for mornings, and a good design."
4,Nice Sounding ~ Easy to Operate ~ Overall Happy,"Received my Sony ICF-CD73V Shower CD Player/Clock Radio today. Popped in the batteries and set it all up. Sounds great! A nice, solid unit.Player would have been more complete if it would play MP3's. :-(( Also, it would be nicer if it had a better way of hanging over say the shower rod, or towel rack. Other than that - I'm happy enough with it. The countdown timer (for timing the kids showers) and the auto turn off capability is a nice plus."
3,"Due to button design, radio only lasts 2-3 years","This is a great little radio. I love the preset stations and auto-off timer. Battery life is decent if you only use the radio- I virtually stopped playing CDs because CDs drain the battery much faster.The big problem is the buttons are not well designed. After a couple of years the plastic sheet that covers the buttons eventually gets brittle and cracks. The button then seem to lose their water-resistant quality and even though I rarely get mine wet, they just stop working. Right now, my batteries are fully charged, but I cannot turn on the radio or even change the time. For the price, I would expect this radio to last more than 2-3 years, but I'll probably purchase a 3rd one anyway because otherwise I like it."
1,Don't Buy It,"We needed to purchase a firewall for our business and this one was recommended to us. It was difficult to install, customer service was non-existent and the refund took weeks (minus the 26% processing fee for a download). If you're under the impression this product will provide ample virus protection, forget it, it doesn't. To try this product cost us time, money and frustration. Despite claims from Firekeys, the product allowed our computers to become infected with a virus. To clean the computers and install a firewall was costly. Repeated calls provided no results only frustration. When we requested compensation for cleaning the virus their software allowed into our system and we were told our request was ""inappropriate"". What was inappropriate is charging a refund processing fee for a product that was ineffective."
5,"thoughtful and wonderful, I love Rabbi Cooper","this audio sent was great. Rabbi cooper is soft spoken and caring, he takes it slow and doesnt beet arounf the bush. he takes you through several meditations, walking you throgh each. a must very anyone who would like to learn or inprove there meditations."
4,A classic on mindfulness meditation,"Jack Kornfield is one of the most influential teachers of mindfulness meditation. Study everything he has written or says. For those of you who want to learn more about mindfulness meditation, I also recommend 'The Path of Mindfulness Meditation' available through Amazon."
1,Terrible CD Avoid It!,"I have ordered a lot of CD's over the years on Guided Meditations and some are very good, some not so good. This one is the worst I have ever encountered. It is a recording of a live session that Kornfield did and sounds like it. The recording of the CD is an obvious afterthought. Besides the sarcasm, thick New York accent, and flippant attitude hard to find a single redeeming quality that would justify the purchase of this CD. Most of what is covered, is on any other beginning meditation CD with far better audio quality and a much more pleasant delivery. I just tossed this one in the trash."
5,Great Meditation tape,"After reading ""A Path with Heart"" by Jack Kornfield, I found his audio tape to be very informative. If you are having doubts about how to pursue meditation and spiritual life, I would highly recommend this audio. I can never listen to it too often. Jack has a wonderful way of getting his point across."
5,RangerRob's Meditation,"My partner and I are neophytes to meditation. This CD came highly recommended by a friend who has been meditating for years.Kornfield leads through the process in a very comforting manner. His advice on how to stop ""outside thought"" enroaching was amazingly valuable - so simple and yet so effective!"
1,"Horrible Movie, Pass On It!","This movie starts out as an easy comedy worth watching, but quickly turns into a horrible story. They tried to make a plot, where no plot was needed (or appropriate). It absolutely killed the movie and the humor. The movie then turned akward.. don't waste your time!!"
2,Rehashed mixed bag with some funny moments,"Just finished watching this movie. I enjoyed some of the early parts of the movie where there was some of that uncensored-even-by-your-brain dialogue where people say EXACTLY what they're thinking, there was some pretty funny stuff.As the movie got more into the making of the porno and the ""romantic"" plot between the two leads progressed the movie got more boring, more crass, and less funny. I'm guessing the actual porn scenes depicted were supposed to be hilarious in kind of a shockingly crass way, but I found myself non-plussed. After enduring the last 30 minutes of boring predictability and shlocky plot, plus some boring raunch, I wish I'd spent my time watching something else. You can still see flashes of talent here, and it starts out with some promise, but by the end it's a mess and I don't recommend this movie."
3,its ok,"yes, its dirty. yes, its funny. yes, its got a nice heart. yes, its everything you expect from a kevin smith movie, his fans should be pleased. there are better comedies out there but there are also worse. elizabeth banks steals the whole show."
1,missing a disk,"I love this movie, but only one of the two disc set made it. It wasn't worth the cost of shipping to send it back."
3,"Kevin Smith's version of ""When Harry Met Sally""","""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" is Kevin Smith's version of ""When Harry Met Sally"". The plot is a painfully simplistic romantic comedy. The dialogue is adult and somewhat interesting, but not close to Smith's best. The porn is soft core, very scant, and not very sexy. There are some naked breasts, and some brief male nudity. Elizabeth Banks keeps her clothes on. Seth Rogen is his usual funny self. Smith is much more of a verbal director than visual, so other than the brief nudity, there's no reason to watch on Blu-ray. Overall, the movie is quite a disappointment, because it is not as funny, original, or interesting as Smith's other movies, and the ""let's make a porno"" hook is mostly tease, similar to ""The Girl Next Door"". Reviewed April 16, 2009 after watching on Blu-ray."
3,Funny enough,"A fairly predictable movie that is meant for base level enjoyment. The humor is mostly crude and there is no mystery as to what is going on. There doesn't really need to be however, it's a comedy. Buy this is you're a fan of Seth Rogen or Kevin Smith comedies and you won't be disappointed."
3,Sporadically funny,"The Bottom Line:The first half an hour or so of Zack and Miri Make a Porno (particularly the High School reunion scene) is often quite funny but soon the movie falls into Knocked Up mode, so desperate to cling to a formulaic romantic plot that it forgets to be a comedy too; even fans of Kevin Smith are likely to be disappointed in the mixed bag of a film.2.5/4"
3,"Nancy Marano, ""You're Nearer""",This wasn't one of her best...and I do like Nancy and her music. The instrumentals are weak and the sound is a little fuzzy.
5,Melvin! How we miss ye!,"This is Mel Torme as his jazziest best...in live concert at Carnegie Hall and surrounded by a 19 piece jazz band led by Gerry Mulligan and with George Shearing on the piano. There are tiny little glitches: a goofed entry by Mulligan, and at one time Shearing seemed a little caught off guard but, heck, this is what makes the album so darned real! (I'm not going to tell you where. You'll have to discover that for yourself!)But Torme was just dialed in. He scats his head off on almost all the cuts and his vocal flexibility, range, and accuracy is just, well, astonishing to me. He's as quick with his voice as Gerry is pushing the buttons on his bari sax.This album leaves no doubt that Mel Torme was the greatest male jazz and pop singer of his generation."
5,"Namerovsky, a modern master","Reminds me of the best of French novelists - Through fictional characters she brings to life the real exodus of Parisians from their city, fleeing the onslought of the German armies in June 1940, It is on a par with Tolstoy's War and Peace. Wonderful character descriptions with vivid narrative of human behavior under stress. What a tragedy that this immensely talented novelist was to be one of the millions of people to perish at Auschwitz and the other Nazi extermination camps."
5,suite francaise,"This is a wonderful, courageous account of the experiences of Jews and other minorities during the war in France,Please read it !"
4,Suite Francaise review,"I found the book disjointed at times...the final story about Lucile and the German and their village was more interesting and quite believable. The writer did create very real images for the reader. I almost abandoned the book after reading about 100 pages, but persevered and then found that the story flowed better."
3,it's okay,"The characters lack credibility. The story is not gripping as one would expect, and the atmosphere of the time has not been captured."
2,Bad Translation,"I am now almost completely through the entire book and need to post a review about the translation. While many reviews tout the excellence of the translation, I believe the translation is actually sub-par. I feel the paragraphs are choppy, and the sentences don't flow into each other. In addition, there are multiple spelling errors, including spelling one character's name incorrectly - multiple times within a single paragraph! These are simple things an editor could have fixed..."
1,Pass on this one!,Really bad! I usually need to finish any book I start. Literally couldn't with this one. I put it down after 150 pages because there was absolutley no plot development and characters were static! I can't believe the overall rating was 4.5 stars! WHY??
2,Suite Francaise,"I did not enjoy this book. It may lose some of its beauty in the translation but it was a difficult read. I appreciate the effort in finding and publishing this book. However, the characters and even the story did not evoke empathy. I did not like or champion any of the characters. I did not care who survived or who died. The French do not ""look good"" in this novel."
4,Great way to learn about the fall of France in WWII,"This novel was written years ago by a woman who actually experienced this period of history. The writing is excellent, and the stories of Parisians from many different walks of life evacuating Paris ahead of the invasion, then subsequently trying to rebuild their lives is interesting, enlightening and sometimes humorous."
5,Best I've Read In 10 Years.,Incredible story for anyone who has studied WWII and the fall of France. It is written with a tender innocence that is gradually lost as the German occupation grows more evil. The appendices at the end of the book brought tears to my eyes - no book has done that to me before.
2,disappointment,"I am a French translator, was a French major in college, and now work for a translation agency. This book was translated well, and that's about it."
5,Martha Stewart's Winter holiday celebrations,I thought this was a wonderful DVD. It was very easy to follow her instructions. The layout is easy to navigate through on the computer. Everything is at your fingertips. It was wonderful!
5,They do make a difference,"I play about two hours of hard, full-court basketball one night per week. The floor itself is made of some kind of tile, and it's unforgiving. My feet always used to hurt terribly after games--and usually stayed hurting for a couple of days--so I decided to give these socks a try. I've been using them for close to two months now, and my feet feel much better. In fact, during the course of a game I don't even pay attention to the way my feet feel. The extra padding also makes my shoe fit more snugly, so my toes don't get jammed as much and I'm not getting aggravated/ingrown toenails anymore, either.I wonder how long these songs will last, though I suppose if you air-dry them as instructed they'll hold up longer.In the end, the socks are worth the money. I can feel a difference, so if your feet hurt from all of the pounding, perhaps these socks will be a solution. I found that they are more effective than a slip-in insole that I purchased as well."
5,Found what I wanted,"This product goes beyond where email programs go. This is the only program I could find that deals with POP3 email and free WEB email. It does no good to monitor email unless you can keep track of all kinds of email, and IMailkeys does a pretty good job. You can block incoming/outgoing email addresses and attachments, as well as filter attachments by file and MIME type and obscenity and any other words or phrases you want. Website email is undetected by the browser, and by firewalls. iMailkeys is the best out there for dealing with all types of email. Nothing else is available. And it costs less than Netkeys, if you don't need everything in Netkeys."
3,"Comprehensive, but not very fine","This is a comprehensive book on the subject of coin grading, and much of the information I am looking for is here. But they don't list all the conditions you would expect to find. A typical coin might have good, fine and extra fine, but lack very good and very fine. So what is a very fine coin worth, halfway between fine and extra fine? Darned if I know."
4,IT IS A GOOD MOVIE ANYWAY,"It is a good movie. And the production is good despite the portrated of Cuban persons are no so good. By this time the criminal Batista ruled Cuba backstage. You only see ""El Presidente"", but Batista's puppet."
5,Great gift book for Boomer rock fans!,This is a fantastic book packed with large color photos on every page. The writeups on the various bands and artists are very interesting and give a lot of indepth information you won't find anywhere else.
4,Not Bad,"This book is packed with USABLE information on a great range of subjects. My only complaint is that all recipies are in cups, tablespoons, etc.. Bakers' percentages are what a real baker needs (which is covered in the book). I own a bakery and would laugh at someone measuring with cups and teaspoons in a professional setting. If I want to use a recipe from the book I have to go back and figure out all of the percentages. Lots of great info though."
4,just what the dr ordered,"Only wish there were more pictures, but that is the only down fall of this cookbook! It has most everything one could possibly want out of an instructional book. If you are learning the ways of becoming a pastry chef or just want to learn the secrets of the trade then this book is for you..Great buy!"
5,Inside trader,This is an excellent reference book for me being a home cook who is serious about baking and pastry making. There are a lot of tips and 'bakers secrets' which I find useful when making large quantities of products. Methods are explained in detail and easy to understand with diagrams. Would like to see more photos and each photo with a page no. refering to the recipe. This is more a text book and not simply a recipe book. It would not be suitable for someone who is not interested in the 'technical' aspects of cooking.
5,"Robust, spans three studs","This is a very strong flat mount (no tilt) that spans three studs on 16"" centers. I bought two of these.Shorter mounts can span only two studs and may make it difficult to center the flat panel display properly. In my case, I had studs almost in the center of both walls where I wanted displays. A two-stud mount would have forced the displays to be well off-center.I believe the 250 lb rating.Three studs, six carriage bolts: those plasma displays are not going anywhere.The package include a generous collection of screws to fit most displays.(Do not lose the strange Allen-like wrench that is included. You need it to tighten the safety screws and you can not get a replacement except from Peerless.)"
2,"Good player, but not for the gym!","I owned this player for just a few days before returning it. It was a decent player, EXCEPT for one thing - The Play/Stop/Skip Back/Skip Foward button is the size of a quarter! Yep, all four controls are on one small single button! This made the player impossible to accurately control while running on the treadmill at the gym. (I was pausing while trying to skip forward, etc) So - if you're into burning music onto CDs and will never need to control the unit while running - This might be for you. But if you need a good player for the gym - Check out the Phillips AZT3202. It works great and is less than half the price of this player!"
5,One of the best books yet.,"One of the best books in the series! It is action-packed in a nice little package, and everyone (except Gaia) finally does what they wanted to do through most of the books. Ed gathers his courage, Heather changes herself, and both Oliver and Tom try to get her. The end kind of leaves you hanging- I can't wait 'til the next book comes out!"
2,2 Stars For Clever Book Design,"When I started this book, I thought I was going to love it. It involves a Manhattan reference librarian who is hired by a wealthy, old, eccentric man who needs help tracking down a watch believed to have been owned by Marie Antoinette. A beach read for the literary set, the book is filled with puns, and clever word play all intentionally formatted to span exactly 360 pages, and resolve the conflict in sixty minute like chapters. The book to it's credit reads very fast, but about half way through I started to not really care about what was happening, and worse after some revelations late in the story, felt let down. I don't know what exactly I was expecting or what kind of pay off, but aside from being clever and well written, it's not something I'd recommend to many people."
1,The Grand Mess,"Allen Kurzwell's book The Grand Complication, may be the worst book I have read in years. It has almost no plot, paper thin characters, and a stupid ending. Mostly it is a forum for AK to use arcane words and gab about library science. In short it is really a grand mess and should be avoided."
2,DIsappointing,"I was looking forward to Kurzweil's new book, having been a fan of ""Case of Curiosities"" way back when, and wondering when he'd finally get around to finishing his sophomore effort. The new book is simply not worth the wait. The characters are paperthin, their motivations are unexplained, the plot meanders and the ending is contrived and unbelievable. Very puzzling, given that we know Kurzweil to be a talented writer. It is a very peculiar book, almost as if the whole thing were an extended inside joke to which only the author was privy. And the continued references to his first book are annoying given that it was written almost 10 years ago and that the author has produced nothing else since. They only add to the inside joke feel of the novel. Better luck next time, Allen."
2,Henry James Reborn... Unfortunately,"OK, the story line is original (I can't imagine anyone could have come up with it), but totally boring. Searching for a missing watch to complete a ""case of curiosities"" is hardly engaging material. Though, the interaction between the characters prevents this book from being a total snoozer.Worst of all (for me), the writer's prose reads as if the book were written in the late 1800's, which would be great, if you find that sort of thing entertaining. I don't.The story is a mystery, just not kind of mystery that I would have picked (the book was a gift) or preferred to read.Bottom line, to the writer's credit, there is great potential as the character development is excellent, but they're caught in a weak story line."
1,Stupid,This series is so stupid i hate it iam Peter and i get tired with writing stupid reviews in the first season buy spongebob sqaurepants and you will have fun
4,"not as good as volume 3, but cool","As I noted, I DIDN'T have Volume 1, but now I do. {I actually have had it for quite some time}. In fact, many many many many many many many many many many many many many weeks. But this, not so long. Throughout this review, I don't want to talk about JUST the 3 volumes. AND NOW, FOR THE COUP DE GRACIE:Some of these episodes are WEIRD. And I don't just say that for {DR.} Weird. But I don't want to keep this too long either. He starts the weirdness! But, I like it however. I'm not so sure what else to say, but that this is neat if you have or haven't seen the show, and don't own this, get it. And I say that ESPECIALLY to whomever hasn't seen the show."
5,Book review,Precious little book for all ages. This volume is lovingly illustrated for the enjoyment of all. An adorable gift for parents and grandparents.
4,Good Gloves,"They will keep your hands dry while riding, but if you have warm hands like me then they will sweat a little. All in all, good gloves."
3,various degrees of interpretation quality on this CD,"A better recording of Motets is that one with Matthew Best and Corydon Singers (Hyperion,****). On the other hand, the sound of John Alldis Choir is very beautiful (especially the sopranos are better than those on Best's recording). I find the St John's College Choir absolutely inappropriate for a recording of Bruckner's motets. I recommend to compare the the Te Deum on this CD with that conducted by Jochum (DG). The most beautifullly sung pieces of the entire CD-set are probably that of Strauss."
1,Immature and Pointless,"I agree with the Publisher's Weekly comment above that ""and some readers may feel the writing is geared more toward teenagers than twenty-somethings"" I was shocked to meet the author and learn she is 31, I had the feeling this was a 12 year old writing the book and it was cute children's book, but 31 is pathetic. Stereotypes of weak and incapable women (and the author being blonde does not help the blonde stereotype either) will persist as long as a book like this is presented as necessary for women above the age of 12 years old. If your parents did not teach you this material buy this book and go home and slap them across the cheek with it, otherwise this book serves no purpose, no useful information, not funny and actually sounds like a condescending court jester. Immature and Pointless."
3,good,"It was a pretty decent CD.I really like the first song on the album, but they rest I havent got into yet.I enjoyed it though."
2,Disappointed,"Charles-Hubert, Paris Men's 3739 Premium Collection Stainless Steel Automatic Watch. No warranty information, no original instruction sheet to show how to set the watch. It shows that they are suppose to be 3 levels of the pin to set the different features, and only two levels exists. I can't get the date and day set just right. I am going to keep it and take it to a jewelers to see what they say about it. It did come with a small card to send it off and pay $12.00 to have the watch repairs, etc. So much for the Life Warranty on a Charles Hubert watch. I didn't receive a receipt in the package. This is the third watch I have purchased through Amazon and none of the watches come with an actual receipt."
4,The end of an era...,"Even with all the turmoil going on in UFO at the time they still put out a good album. Pete Way had left the band to form ""Waysted"". The day was saved by Mr. Chapman who not only handled the lead guitar duties, but also did a SUPERB job playing the bass parts on this album. You can tell it's not Pete Way as the style is very different but it is damn good. This album really kicks butt, Paul Chapman shines on this one. It's too bad he did not continue with the band. He really is a fine guitarist & never got the credit he deserved. Yes this is the last ""real"" UFO album. If you have not heard it in a while give it another chance. It's really quite good."
4,Great hangers for the price,"We have tried many wooden hangers but these were the best we have found for the price. There were better quality ones out there but, when you want to populate a master walk-in closet with them, the cost outweighs the occasional flaw. By occasional flaw I mean, poor sanding, splintering, mildly worped, uneven stain on the wood...that sort of thing. Out of 120 hangers I had about 9 that were bad enough that I didn't use them. That's pretty good for the cost of these. It is a shame I can't return them but I would have to return 30 and it just isn't worth it to me. They are a great color and do a much better job of protecting our clothes than those standard plastic ones. Overall, an excellent value."
3,Born into Brothels: Photographs by the Children or Calcutta,I bought this because I wanted to preserve my impressions after viewing the DVD. The DVD was exceptional as is the story of these children and how quick they were to pick up a camera and be able to do something with it. I'm still working on that. This is a nice companion to the DVD but if I had it to do over again I would probably pass.
4,Bumpin Beats,"The only reason I didn't give this album 5 stars, is that there are songs on this dicsc that can be found else where. However listening to this disc for the first time today, I have not been able to stop listening to it. great sound quality and content. A must for a Kerri Chandler fan."
1,terrible tub crayons,i did't get these from amazon but still wanted to warn other parents they stink! they wouldn't write on a wet surface and kept falling out of the holder. they were just a total waste of 5$. i had much better luck with the star tub crayon. thankfully we just got another one of those since i had to throw the other ones out after one bath!
2,Quality has gone down,"I previously reviewed the other Alex set that comes with the duck sponge. My son got that as a gift and they lasted and didn't melt. Now that my daughter is old enough, I bought a set of these without the sponge for her. They were terrible and melted and wouldn't come up out of the holder. They don't write well on wet tile at all, so what is the point of being able to use them in the tub??? I think they have reformulated the crayons or something because the quality has definitely gone down since 4 years ago."
3,"it was light, it was simple...","Since someone else has already explained the contents of the book I won't go into that. Suffice-to-say, it was an easy read. A little suspense, a little romance and an ending, well...you know how it would end. It's one of those books that fills your free time- nothing stupendous but not bad either."
5,One of the Best movies I've seen,great movie. it's all been said before but it is really unique and unlike most movies (in a good way). Well worth it to rent it.
1,this cd sucks!,"the title of my reveiw says it all:this cd sucks. i've got two of their other cds, and both of them i like, but Mort is terrible. i threw it out the window of my car the day i got it. worst five bucks ive ever spent. save your money for one of their other cds, because Mort is fit only to be a coaster."
4,Powerful and practical medicine....,"This is an atypical book on writing, which focuses on something that man has been doing since language was invented -- telling engaging stories. The concepts are simple and powerful, but the application of them is not! I found that this book has helped me to improve my writing and appreciate other people's writing. Jon Franklin is a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner who honed his skills in the writing trenches rather than in a classroom. At times, what he has to say is bitter medicine, but reading your finished product will be worth the effort.I at times found Jon Franklin's tone a bit offensive. Sometimes, he came across as a ""know it all"" or that his way was the only way. In other words, he seemed a bit rigid and perhaps even arrogant. However, the advice is sound and I must admit that after trying the techniques, I can see why he encourages (pushes!) so hard for the writing principles he obviously believes in and that have made him very successful."
5,CD's are great!,"I've had this CD set in the bookcase for a while before I had the chance to use them.Unlike another reviewer, I found his voice to be very conducive to the ""trips"" I took while listening to the CD's.I like that he organizes the points and introductions he makes to various gates of dreaming. The CD's make it easy to go directly where you want to listen.Because I was able to relax in a meditative position while listening to Robert Moss, I'm pretty sure I got more out of this CD set than I would have a book."
5,Deliciously Wicked!!!,"I won't go into plot descriptions of the episodes, especially since others have done it so well. I'll just say this is a wonderful series full of deliciously wicked characters who haven't a decent bone in their manipulative, malevolent, conniving bodies. I doubt that Rome actually functioned in the way this HBO melodrama suggests, but who cares! HBO took quite a chance producing this obviously expensive series, but it pays off. Great, great, geat!!! I'm sorry there won't be a series 3."
4,Rome Season 2,Completes the first season very well. My only complaint pertains to both series and is that the explicit sex scenes could have been done with much more taste and decorum. I found myself wanting those scenes to be over and to get on with the rest of the story!
5,Rome,"Great story line. Lots of action, and you continue to learn about the characters as they progress through the story. Has some nudity, but that never hurt anything. Worth buying. HBO has a lot of great shows, and this is one of them."
5,Rome: The Complete Second Season,It arrived and that is all you need to know.I also hate when it is required on how many words I have to say to rate a product.
5,"Great Series ""ROME"" 2nd season","Excellent HBO Series, I wish this series would continue. This was cheap enough through Amazon for me to purchase. I also have the 1st season."
4,Still good.,"Unfortunately, the second season of Rome is more of a follow-up to the first, although that is not to say that there is any flaw in the acting, writing, or directing; there is none. Once again, HBO proves that money and talent, when together, make for superb entertainment."
5,Read my Review,"""Senioritis"" is the type of book that anyone can relate to; the main characters differ so much that I know there is one you can relate to. Anyone in high school can tell you that this is the type of thing that really goes on and the teenagers in the book give believeable responses to the conflicts that arise. Tate Thompson is a keen observer of this generation and offers his expertise on how to survive until graduation and afterward. We look forward to any new publishings he may produce."
5,AMAZING SOUND FOR THE PRICE,"I have a pair of these 84's as well as the 64's and love both of them. You'll be hard pressed to find a better speaker for the money esp. one with the clarity and imaging of these. Side by side the 84's and 64's are very similar and I can't decide which one I like more. You can't go wrong though for a pair of 64's for $240! I hear the crossover Ed Frias does is real popular, improving the warmth and clarity for pretty cheap. You can find out more about him in audio review websites."
4,BIC America DV84 Speakers,"I have recently upgraded from an older 5.1 Sony receiver STRDE425 and Cerwin Vega E315's (12"" 3 way),JBL tiny rear m50's, Sony powered sub (cheapo SAwm40 12"") to the BIC DV84's, a Marantz SR6001 receiver, NAD 2200 power amp, some older B&W DM580 small towers for the rear and a Polk PSW505 12"" sub. I have the same Cerwin center speaker (which I can't wait to replace). I didn't realize what I was missing. I placed the BICs next to the Cerwins with just the Marantz and couldn't believe the difference in clarity. The BICs blew them away. I must say the tweeters on the BICs are way too much. I have the parametric eq set at -8 on the highest freq. and it's still too bright. I'm just getting into the entry level audiophile stuff (it's addicting) so I'm not an expert but I know a bit about it. Like everyone says... great bang for the buck. I think I'm going to have to spend a lot more to get a significant increase in quality."
5,Works great. 2nd one I've owned,"I have an identical model that lasted for years. It finally stopped sensing water flow and I thought it was broken. I ordered a new sump pump but also a repair kit (SPRK-2 UPC: 010121993204). I was able to fix the original and now have this as a spare unit. Hopefully I will never have to need it, but it's there nonetheless."
1,Never worked when needed!,It only worked ince when we set it up.There was a short....water must have got in the engine.shorted out my GFIs.Not safe.
5,HAMBURG...TURNED ON...!,"ANOTHER GREAT RE-RELEASE BY RGF OF WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN A REALLY GREAT SHOW. THE SOUND PRODUCTION IS GOOD & SO'S THE BAND'S PLAYING. WISH I COULD HAVE BEEN THERE...! IT'S RARE IN THAT A BRACE OF TUNES ARE FROM ""DOWN IN THE BUNKER."" THE LIVE VERSION OF ""JOHNNY COOL"" IS ACES, TOO. IN CASE SOMEONE FROM HARLEY-DAVIDSON IS READING THIS, THE LIVE VERSION OF ""HARLEY-DAVIDSON"" WOULD MAKE FOR A GREAT THEME SONG FOR THEIR TV ADVERTISING. RGF HAS THE HABIT OF INCLUDING BONUS TRACKS ON THESE RE-RELEASES, AND I'M POWERFUL GLAD THEY DO. THEY MAKE THIS MORE OF A TREASURE THAN IT OTHERWISE WOULD BE. ALL FANS OF SGB EVERYWHERE SHOULD OWN THIS, AND PAY GRATEFUL TRIBUTE TO RGF FOR GETTING IT DONE. BUY IT, PUT IT IN, TURN THE VOLUME WAY UP, THEN SIT BACK AND BE BLOWN AWAY BY A GREAT LIVE SET...!!!"
2,Santa and the three bears,"Not a very good copy. Was really dark and grainy, not really good sound. Disappointing, was one of my favorites growing up:("
2,councell,I did not like this book at all. No real story and MAD DOG and OOP must be related to superman. Did not ring true to me.
2,A phan,"I am from Phila, and remember seeing Wilt as a child. He has always been my favorite sports figure. The book does not seem very favorable to him- maybe it is accurate. But, what is missing is many personal stories people have told about his accomplishments on and off the court. Cheery (the author) does not seem to be a fan of Wilt's or of Phila, even though he is from Phila. Even the front and back covers have photos of Wilt in Lakers uniforms!A definitive biography is yet to be written."
5,best thing for college student and/or gamer,The bass pumps and can really shake you. It is very comfy to lye on and the sound is great. Iv had this for years now and it is still a joy to use.
4,Fine sound and solid playing,"This is a fine sounding disk with solid interpretations of the music. This collection provides all three string quartets with the two sontatas for clarinet and piano. It seems an odd mix, but somehow it works in this collection.Brahms writes so well for string quartet that I find myself wishing he had found a way to write more of them. Maybe he did and burned them. In any case, these are pieces to treasure and to listen to over and over again. And certainly you will want to hear different interpretations of these pieces.George Pieterson has a beautiful tone and plays the clarinet sontas with hepzibah Menuhin on the piano. They perform well together and let us hear a part of the repertoire we don't get exposed to unless we are clarinetists or accompanists or relatives to clarinetists! I have always loved the tone of the clarinet and there is a lot to love in these recordings.This fine recording is certainly worthy of a place in your collection."
3,very hard to read,"I agree with the publishers weekly review. I am usually not one to write reviews, but this book compelled me to, because of it's odd nature.It starts off well, simialar to any ""post-human"" / ""avant garde"" sci-fi. Then it just goes on and on without being clear to with what is actually going on. I got about 2/3 of the way through this book before i actually had to put it down and say, this is ""well written"", but not good. Nothing is explained, i was still unclear about many details in the universe, and i could barely follow what was happening. Very dissapointed."
2,Is this a joke?,"The story was very good and the author hit it right on the head with the feelings of some whites towards African Americans in this era. There were times I would have liked to slap Miss Lillian across the face. However, all the best of the book was lost with the ending. Perhaps the author forgot she was going on vacation and just had to wrap it up."
3,that's it???????,"That's how it ended??? All of that suspense for an ending like that????? Awesome plot, horrible resolution. Needs a sequel."
3,Pretty good.,"This anime is a female James Bond-ish kind of affair.I actually thought the story was good enough that all the fan service didn't bother me at all.The panty shots are great... and are placed strategically to seem as though it is the best camera angle to demonstrate the situation... Like a panty shot facing up while the character is looking or reaching for something high... It is reaching on the part of the artists but it wasn't insulting, and certainly didn't hurt the story.Some of the panty shots could make great posters to advertise this.In the end the characters and story are defined well enough that you don't mind owning this one.Not the best anime but certainly not the most horrible.It is interesting and I would buy it again, after having seen it."
3,bargain map,"Very good, current world map for use in classroom work. Not really ""wall sized"", but good for group work in social studies, foreign language, current events, etc. Not printed on very substantial paper."
5,Your pet will benefit from this book,"This was a great book. If you are looking for ways to help your pet feel better, this is the book. It works with helping them emotionally. I use many of the suggestions in this book and they work! I would recommend this if you are into holistic healing methods for animals."
2,Impossible to Keep Clean,"As others have said, these toys are impossible to keep clean. No matter how I clean them or store them after use, they fill up with nasty mildew and mold, which inevitably squirts out when my babies are squirting them into each other's faces. Disgusting! They were fun and cute for the first week, really gross for the next few weeks, and eventually I just tossed them."
3,You get what you pay for,"These cheap little bath toys were a big hit with baby, not with mommy. My son (10 months) loves playing with these in the tub. I, however, do not enjoy trying to get the water out of them after he's through. They are cute and colorful and fun for my son. As others have said some of them don't squirt water (at all) and they don't snap together well. It is nearly impossible to get water out of many of them. They started to stink so into the garbage they went. I bit of a disappointment. At least I was only out $10."
3,Squirt toys,I like the water toys quite well. I am unhappy that the netting does not stay on the tub surround. The suction cups do not seem to hold very well. My grandchildren really enjoying playing with the toys.
2,"Cute, but that's about the extent of it",I have trouble squeezing these to make the water squirt out - no way can my kids do them! They also don't link together very easily and once together they don't stay together.
2,Item arrived dirty,"Item arrived promptly but it arrived dirty -- black marks all over the item -- as if it had been on the floor in the store for months. I was embarassed to give the gift. Someone should have noticed this before sending it out. Especially if they want to be an internet merchant....As the customer, I have to TRUST that the merchant will pick out the best item in the lot."
2,Not that great!,"Pick another bath toy. The creatures snap together, but the connection is flimsy and they just fall apart. They are very difficult to squeeze (to squirt water) for an adult, so you can imagine how tough it is for my 13-month-old son. And many of you might like the storage bag and its ability to drain the water out while sticking to your tub wall; however, the area at the very bottom (where 98% of the water will drain) is sold plastic...the sides are mesh. Silly design. Too many bath toys out there to waste your money on this product."
3,Just don't use them in the water!,"I haven't read all the other reviews, but from what I can see, most people feel the same way I do about these. My baby likes to chew on these and play with them outside of the tub. I have some that have never been in the water and those she plays with along with her other toys. The one's in the tub never quite empty completely and I can only imagine what's growing inside! Also, the plastic is VERY hard. Too hard for a small child to fill with water and use as a squirting toy. So, while these are colorful and fun, I'll take two stars away due to the poor design."
3,Cute and colorful but hard to fit together,"These are cute little figures, but don't buy them if you want something specifically to fit together or squeeze water. The holes and ""pegs"" that join the pieces together don't work very well, and the shapes are too hard for an adult to squeeze water out of, let alone a child."
2,too hard to squirt and mildew buildup,I first thought these were so adorable. They don't squirt well at all. The material is too hard to squeeze out the water. The water that's stuck in the toy builds up mildew and you don't want that floating in your baby's bath water or even let your baby put in his mouth. I think it's meant for playpen playtime not bath time. I say don't waste your money. Get the cute little squirt duckies instead.... and I did!
5,Peeling the Onion,This book is one of the best books I have ever read!!!! The author (Wendy Orr) has managed to make every detail come alive by using her past expriences. This book is unsuitable for anyone under the age of 13 due to some feelings and language used. It's a great book for adults as well! Don't believe me??? Read it and see!
1,narrow shoes are uncomfortable,"These shoes would have been perfect if they were made for wider feet, a more comfortable width. Unfortunately they are made for very narrow feet. Sadly could not wear it."
3,"Sharpest Toe Nail Clipper, But They Slip Like Crazy","One would think that with some dimpling on the part where you would press down with your thumb, these would not slip, but I've yet to use them where the ""lever"" didn't move to left or right or just slip out of my hand. You'd think for this price, it would have been engineered better.So I ""engineered"" it better by putting a piece of moleskin on the bottom of the level and the bottom of the clipper, and everything is fine. I would have thought the manufacturers would have thought of this.Other than that, they're the sharpest toe nail clippers I've had and certainly do the job. As for leaving sharp edges, every pair leaves sharp edges. You can't expect to make one clip and be done."
2,have tiny toes?,"Although this is listed as a toenail clipper, it only works on my smaller toes. The cutting edges have an ""over bite"" and don't open very far. The cut is smooth but many small clips are needed to clip the big toe nail and middle toe nail. Clipper feels good in the hand and is powerful enough for the job but the jaws are too close together so nails don't fit in. The cutting edge is as narrow as most fingernail clippers."
1,DOE NOT CLIP NAILS,I waited quite a period of time to receive these clippers and they finally arrived. Now I find they feel like a good weight but they do not cut nails.Which is the purpose of nail clippers! Do not buy them. I wonder if they are the same one everyone else is talking about?
5,Great Clipper!,Does exactly what it is advertised to do. Very pleased with the quality and the ease of use.Highly recommend this to anyone with tough or hard to trim toe nails.
4,Rippinryki,"This is a beautiful nail clipper and will probably be the only one anyone would have to purchase due to the overall quality of steel,sharpness of blades,and overall construction.I had no problem buying this toe nail clipper due to the fact I currently own a smaller finger nail clipper which still cuts as well as it did when I bought it 30 years ago."
2,silly ending,"beautiful art by Romita. And in the beginning, say, half of the collection the story is OK. Passable, yes. But from there it just starts down in to silliness. The writing itself is pretty boring, too. So, the story and the actual writing is just a real let down. Plus, the collection ends but the story continues - the reader is left with no conclusion! Pass this one unless you are dieing to see Romita art."
2,Horrible Buttons,"This phone does everything it says it does just fine, but I cannot stand it for one reason--THE BUTTONS. THEY DRIVE ME POSITIVELY INSANE. The ""brushed steel"" thing is horrible, it feels like pushing on sandpaper. The buttons are not raised at all, in fact they are RECESSED into the phone! Everything about them is horrible. I hate pushing buttons, and that is the main function of the phone! DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE OFF THE INTERNET!! Go into a store and look at it and push the buttons before you buy it!!!!!!! If you don't, you will probably reallllly regret it. Trust me on this, I would've loved the phone but for the buttons :(! And they are a big deal!"
4,"Good, for a cheaper flip phone.","Yeah, Its a good phone, haven't had any problems with it. Except, I wouldn't buy it from Amazon...Go to www.buy.com, I got the phone for free with the nextel plan.I would recomend this phone, but I just wish it had a better inteface, not very attractive...kind looks like my first cell phone."
2,Complete Crap,"I've had this phone for over a year now. I don't make or receive many calls, but when I do it's a crap shoot. The phone will chirp and shut off for no good reason. It said the battery was low and shut off when it was almost a full charge.I have had to pop the battery out to reset the phone several times just to get it to work. One time it locked-up and wouldn't even shut off without removing the battery.I have had no problems with the push-to-talk feature.My husband has this same phone and has no problems, so it's entirely possible I have a lemon of a phone.I would never recommend this phone to anyone."
4,"Good introduction to HTML, lacks examples",This was a decent book for introducing someone to the world of HTML. Covers most important topics but doesn't go into much depth on each topic. The item most lacking is multiple and detailed examples. Add these to the next edition and it becomes a great learning tool. This book does not work as a reference guide to HTML but overall is a good intro to HTML.
5,work of art with art work,"Like much of the best of Nurse With Wound, this just makes no sense. I would call it a musical feast of drum circles, laughter and the female orgasm. Swamp Rat, especially, catches this drum circle groove. Rhythm as melody has never been done better.Per the liner notes this CD was originally released in January 1987 as an edition of 100 signed copies each with two original paintings, and a facsimile edition of 555 copies was released in December 2003. Track five, Shattering Man Falling (1984), was recorded live at Bar Maldoror.Mr. Stapleton hisself is responsible for the cover painting, which may or may not be a portrait of the Queen Mother with a mustache. I, of course, prefer to think it is.Nurse with Wound is not for the faint of heart, but I just love this cd which is so much more concentrated than the double Second Pirate Session. Mid-80's industrial at its best!"
2,More Music is not worth it---Original Soundtrack was great,"I didn't like the ""more music"" CD at all. Some of the small clips of music have selected voice clips from the movie which I think takes away from the ""music."" The added three bagpipe scores at the end of the CD are absolute fluff. To DIRECTLY quote the back of the CD case: ""The traditional Scottish bagpipe songs have been added as a bonus to keep the spirit of William Wallace and his warrior poets alive and to further enhance your listening pleasure."" NOOOOO, the reason is the other clips are so short that they needed to add more scores to set a higher price. If you want to listen to Braveheart music get the orignal soundtrack (which is outstanding!), if you want the voice, get the video or soon to be released DVD...save your money and do not get ""more music!"""
2,Version 3 is a Beta version - Too Many Bugs!,"I was using ArcSoft but bought PowerDirector 3.0 based on a review and the advertising. It has some slick features (mainly effects and transitions) that I like but the program is so quirky I have yet to finish a movie with it. I make short mpegs with it and import them into my ArkSoft program to get what I want. Examples of negatives - Losses picture file names or mixes them up,losses pictures, crashes with no warning sometimes, once was unable to set the default duration time for picture display - had to set everyone manually or start all over, cannot select all pics and perform the same function on them. My advice, wait for a few versions before buying."
2,?????,Would like to purchase this but have searched the net for customer reviews and (to my dismay) have not found any but the two listed here.
2,Wanted more,"Simply had little to do with Ben Franklin. Wanted a historical tale of intrique and got little of any interest. Do not want to ruin it for those that have not read it, but if you are looking for anything of any content about Ben Franklin, this is not the book. Left a few things open, lets hope it is not for a sequel."
2,"Great premise, ultimately disappointing","How do you write a mystery starring Benjamin Franklin and make it inconsequential?This book started out well enough, plenty of neat ""I didn't know that!"" moments about the founding fathers but especially about Franklin, but the book fell far short. the villain was incredibly one dimensional, the many threads of the story were left unraveled and the whole exercise seemed contrived and forced. The mystery itself was trite. I am very disappointed. I am big fan of Mr. Lehrer but this book left me cold."
2,No English translations,"I borrowed these DVDs from the library and watched a little of the first one and fast forwarded the rest to make sure it's just as bad.This is supposedly a 2009 product, but the video and animations look like they are from the 80's. The bigger problem though is that there is no English translation, so if you don't already understand what they are saying in the videos, you won't learn it by watching them. On the back of the DVD case they say the DVDs have English subtitles and a booklet (accessible in a computer). Unfortunately this is not true! There are no English subtitles (only Spanish subtitles) and no booklet. Also, note that they speak with Castilian, not Latin American accents.These DVDs may be of some use to someone who (1) already knows some basic Spanish, (2) is interested in learning specifically Castilian Spanish, and (3) would like to practice speaking the language by repeating what they say in the videos."
1,carbquik,"taste terrible, i have tried several recipes. i would not buy this agian.need to improve you recipes. you do have good recipes ideas"
4,"Good product, too expensive here","This is a very good tasting, versatile product, but you can buy it for $11.99 for the 3 lb. box at netrition dot com."
2,Nice but too pricey.,"If you need a biscuit fix this is good, but costs too much (Should be 1/3 the price). A better way is to get the book 'Carb Wars: Sugar is the New Fat' (ISBN 0979201802) and use the cooked gluten flour secret to make your own for much less money. (The Popovers are great!)"
5,A Great Album.,"This may be Heather's first album, but she has the potential to become one of christian music's hottest artists. Go out and buy the album and you'll find out why."
4,Works just as well but costs less than the Nikon EN-EL1,"I own a Nikon coolpix 5700, while putting it through its paces I found out quite early on that the battery power is an issue with the 5700. It wouldn't last a reasonable day worth of photographs on just one battery charge.So I bought the Digicom rechargeable battery and I use it with my 5700 and I charge it in both my Nikon MH-53C Car Charger and in the Nikon charger that came with the camera.When I'm using the camera I honestly couldn't tell you which battery I'm using at the time. The Digicom works just as well as my official Nikon EN-EL1 rechargeable battery but at a lower cost than the EN-EL1."
2,no thank you !!!,"In this recording, Jose Carreras, and Irgmar Wixell, are very weak in all senses. In the roles of Riccardo and Renato the principals interpreters of the roles are Di Stefano, Bergonzi, Gobbi, Bruson and Bastianini. Montserrat Caballe has a pretty voice, but in this rol is very weak and no dramatic. Colin Davis is not a Verdian Director, he has not flame and force. He is a super great director but in Berlioz and Mozart."
3,Great conducting,"Colin Davis shines for me here. He shapes the music wonderfully and has a fine sense of style. The best of the singers is Carreras: he creates an intense character portrayal, though he shows signs of strain. Caballe, of course, has wonderful soft notes, but her voice wobbles horribly at forte and some of the more climactic moments sound like shrieking. Wixell is lyrical but sounds lightweight compared to others. Unfortunately, the Oscar is inadequate, and, despite what a previous reviewer suggests, you DO need a first-rate Oscar otherwise the ensembles tend to collapse - Verdi himself was adamant about the importance of Oscar to both the dramatic and musical design. Turn to Reri Grist on either the Leinsdorf or Muti sets and the point is easily made."
4,Buyer beware,"This is an excellent how-to book, well-worth having. However, do not buy it if you already have Provost's ""Beyond Style."" ""Make Your Words Work"" is nothing but a (barely) repackaged version of ""Beyond Style,"" with hardly any useful new material. Shamefully, nothing in ""Make Your Words Work"" references or even hints at its parentage. This book should have been entitled ""Beyond Style, Second Edition."""
4,Affordable squid-type power strip,"I've read quite a few reviews saying this was a bulky product. Well... it's supposed to be. That's how ""power squid"" type power strips work. They take up a lot of space so you can plug many, large adapters into one strip. That being said, it functions wonderfully.The only ""problem"" I have with this strip is the power button. It's kind of jiggly, but I've turned it on and off at least once a day for about a year, and it still works like it did the day I bought it."
3,Better than taking pills!!,"My doctor suggested this product for me. I don't like the smell but, would recommend it to anyone who needs it."
1,Like they say at the straw factory....,THIS SUCKS! If you are looking for a hidden gem worth buying then purchase Alive and Well. Stay away from this CD. I found it at Newbury's and figured what the heck...it is just so lame and not like their other material.
5,Great!,"This is a great book, everything is well explained in detail.Beyond my expectations.I recommende it!"
3,Not quite ready for it at 18 months,"I think the recommended ages for this one are off. My son loves the idea of this truck, but becomes incredibly frustrated while pushing it. The handle swings around completely (it's not fixed at the base), so sometimes when he's trying to push the truck, the handle moves, but the truck doesn't. The result is a frustrated, stomping tantrum - over and over again. It's packed up for a few months. We will try it again."
5,The Shield,"We just love the Shield, the action & suspense kept one hooked right up until the end, though once again we felt the ending kind of sucked due to all that had happened in all the previous seasons....still recommend folks to watch all seasons, it is action packed!!"
2,Subtitles,"If you enjoyed seasons 1 through 6 with English subtitles, you will be annoyed and disappointed to know that season 7 has no English subtitles, not even in the boxed set. A major flaw in my opinion."
3,Thanks,"good peace of mind that makes me buy at amazon.com I guarantee that my purchases arrive in time to be safe and come without drawbacks for me is the first purchase I make, and hope to do again is that my personal data and currency exchange provided always be guarded by the people of amazon.atteCustomer Success"
5,a pity,"indeed, it's a pity it's the final season, cause one develops a very powerful addiction to the shield.. and the final season, thou regrettable in it's finality, is an awesome wrap up of all the previous seasons.. Commendable acting; tough, consistent and extraordinarily riveting plot and very, very fine camera work that one will remember (and most certainly long for after the shield is put away in a drawer)."
4,DVD of Roswell crash Good,"Secrets of UFOs: Roswell UFO CrashUFO Secret: The Roswell Crash - The Best EvidenceUFO Crash at RoswellI thought the video of ""Secrets of UFOs: Roswell UFO Crash"" was well done and with good information. It was a rehash of what occured with actors to play the part of the key people. The video showed all the angles of the crash and what the goverment did to cover the crash up. The video showed all the sources of the crash and documented what occured. I would buy the video if I were you and if your a UFO buff, this is a good video to see."
3,Wheel interface is not easily used,"This armband is much better than the other armbands I have tried, but it is still difficult to access the wheel interface. I am back to using the Belkin F8Z130 Clear Acrylic Case, and sticking it in my pocket."
3,with a quick fix it'll do,"While I was initially very excited about this book, I found that a lot of the recipes needed some help in the taste direction. It was one of my first vegan cookbooks, and after 7 years as a vegan, I know that we can do better than this. Some things in it I still use, like the veggie patties, but even those I had to add some salt, spices and garlic to get them to taste as delicious as I'd like (always my goal). Plenty of other books will give you recipes that need less tampering and more YUM. For die-hards only, as part of our collective veggie-dues."
5,it!,"I often reference Simply Vegan. It's half recipes (which are EASY!), and half is basically vegan nutrition 101. Oh, and I ' the tables that list which foods contain the largest amounts of various nutrients. This book is not new, but is tried and true in my fam.Given that the recipes contain very few ingredients, we've added to (or otherwise altered) many of the dishes over several years. Great ideas, though!"
4,good read,"I thought this was a book with an interesting storyline. I am becoming bored with the same plots associated in the ""hip-hop"" genre of novels."
2,only useful for a beginner,"this book revolves around questions like what is spirituality, development of spirituality in her own life and different areas of spirituality- mind body soul. examples of meditation provided. this book is a brief guide for someone reading on the subject for the first time. It is too basic. much better books on spirituality and meditation out there- like wherever you go there you are.it did nothing to enhance my knowledge or my sense of well being. Her personal narrative is woven throughout the book, and I just skipped over all of it. her first book 'broken open' is MUCH better. this really didn't do anything for me. I didnt get anything out of it except a few quotes."
1,No english subtitles,My one star comes from the fact that I was looking for something to help me with conversation but had the english subtitles that I could follow along to know what was happening in the conversations. This is all in french with french subtitles. Not very helpful for a person like me trying to relearn french. This is more for a person who is some what already fluent in french and needs help with conversations. Not a total waste but won't be able to use if for a while.
2,What's going on?,"I had hoped to learn some basic French, but this is definitely for people who already know quite a bit of it. I could see this being helpful as a refresher, but not for a beginner. I shall continue my search."
2,Changed sizes,"569s fit me perfectly a couple years ago. The best fitting ones were from Mexico. Recently I have found the newer ones from Cambodia and Bangladesh to be a terrible fit, even with the exact same measurements. They are too tight in the thighs and butt, with about an extra inch or two around the waist and tiny pockets. I did find a pair that was made in Columbia that fit like the pair from Mexico, with just a little bit smaller waist, which isn't a big problem. The change in cut has been frustrating."
1,569's = Terrible Fitting Levis,"These are a terrible fit compared to the old style 569's. Believe all the one star reviews - these are not your old Levi's. They shortened the rise, dropped the natural waist several inches, narrowed the legs, and are using paper thin cotton.The marketing whizzes at Levi's must all be 22 years old..and these jeans may be just what the young crowd crave, but don't ignore the older folks. We'll shift our money to Dickies or others that supply a proper fitting jean. Wise up Levi!!!"
1,already,"I ordered this pair of jeans b/c 569s and 559 are the most comfortable pants I own. A month after I got them and 4 or 5 wears, the pants have holes and the denim feels very thin in those areas. I have several other pairs and none feel this thin. There has been no snagging event to rip them and the holes are in the middle of the fabric and not near a seam. $10 each time I wore them and now there are holes were I can no longer wear them."
2,Ordered button fly and received zipper fly.,Jeans okay at best. Called to get the button fly version I ordered and got resistence. Representive didn't know what button fly was but claimed the top fastener was button and I said yeah but that's not the fly.... need I say more.-fairly thin fabric (good look though)-reduced fabric amount (a little less room in key areas)-zipper is low quality and smaller size (one reason for ordering button fly)If you buy these jeans increase your size by one and know that the button fly and zipper fly have the same part number. ie your will get zipper fly even if you return them you will get them again.
1,"Hey! What's the deal, Levi's???","Alright, me too. I have been buying Levi's 569 jeans for both my husband and two teenage boys for years, since 1996 for my husband and at least the last ten years for my boys. The Levi's 569 had the fit that they always liked the best, nice and loose. The jeans that I have purchased recently are not nearly as roomy as the older pairs. I compared a pair of 36 x 34 jeans from around 2005 to what is supposed to be an identical pair in the same size that was purchased September 2012, and the newer pair is at least 2"" less roomy in the seat and thighs than the older pair when laid flat, so that means that 4"" of fabric are mising in the new cut.Levi's, these jeans are going back and I'm buying the Lee Dungarees.Lee Men's Dungarees Loose Fit Carpenter Jean"
1,Incredibly tight!,"This is ridiculous! The size i received is NOTHING like the size of 31x34 in physical stores! Can you please PLEASE stop wasting people's time and get a standard measuring tape?!?! I tried this same cut and size in the store - fits great. I tried 30 and 32, but wanted a size in between. I ordered the 31 waist and it was incredibly tight ~ 2 inches too tight. How do you get it THAT wrong?! I would have kept it if it had any remote chance of loosening, but this was absolutely unusable!"
1,A Joke,"First off, these jeans are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT than the ones Levis used to make WITH THE EXACT SAME NAME. How stupid is that? I guess it's smart if you're intentionally trying to trick people.These jeans are made out of a thinner, cheaper material, and worst of all they have minimal crotch room. If you have male reproductive body parts, they will not fit in these jeans. Also, these jeans are made in various third world countries, so quality, materials, and fit will vary. An incredibly terrible product. Because of this, it will be a long time before I ever buy Levis again, if ever."
2,"Tight, not loose at all","I am a pretty normal guy. Not fat or overweight at all. I run, so my thighs are also bit muscular. These are skin tight on my thighs and seat. There is almost no rise in these jeans. For reference, I ordered the 31 waist and had room for a water bottle between the waistband and my waist. So, skin tight thighs and seat, but oversized waist. I didn't measure, but the 31 must have been closer to a 38 or so.Terrible sizing.The color looked nice."
1,LEVIS 569 NEVER DELIVERED,I NEVER RECEIVED BOTH OF MY LEVIS 569 JEANS: 1 BLACK & 1 BLUE JAGGER. BUT I WAS ABLE TO GET FULL REFUNDS. DESPITE I WAS HOPING TO PURCHASE BOTH OF IT AS PART OF MY LEVIS 569 JEANS COLLECTION TO WEAR ON A DAILY BASIS. OH WELL? I'LL WAIT TO RE-ORDER BOTH OF THEM AGAIN.
4,cute,"liked very much the look and fit of the jean on my husband. but it fits big, i wanted a 34, it fits like a 36. other than that, great jeans."
1,Received knockoff 569 jeans,"I ordered two pairs of Levis 569 loose and straight jeans and what I received were two pairs of knockoff jeans. I did not know at first until I washed them and tried them on the following week. They shrank so much that they don't fit. I asked for refund but they sent me two more pair instead which they were just like the first two pair. Finally, I had to call Amazon and asked for refund which I hope they will honor."
1,Wrong style,"I have three other pairs of 569s. I knew the style and the exact size that I needed, so I ordered them. Unfortunately they were not 569s. They sent me the right size that I needed, but I have big legs and the loose jeans are a necessity and these were the tight fitting jeans. I am disappointed."
3,The jeans are great if you can get the right size - BEWARE - try them on in a store,"I ordered these in a 36 waist, because I had a pair at home already with that waist size, and it is in fact my waist size. When these arrived, they were labeled 36 waist but were huge. So I measured the waist and found them to be 40 inches. I figured for sure they were mislabeled at the factory so I ordered a replacement pair. Same thing. Apparently, Levi's wants me to feel like I've lost inches from my waist lately. Bottom line is that this item needs to be tried on in the store first. Otherwise, they're great."
1,Not the Same 569's,"Unfortunately the other 1 star reviews are right. Levis has changed the cut of the previously perfect pair of jeans. They're smaller, shorter and definitely not loose. The problem now is, what's going to replace my 569s? I've been ordering them for years because they were a reliable fit. You've lost yet another customer Levis."
2,Size change,"I bought this pair because my current pair is wearing thin. I assumed that buying the same style, wash, and size would mean that I would get a similar pair if jeans. Apparently a 31x34 is now 1 inch shorter than it was a few years ago. Word to the wise, never assume that identical jeans fit the same."
1,beware,if you have worn 569's before and liked the fit you will not like these. They are much shorter in the crotch. They are nothing like the 569's I have purchased in the stores. Very disappointing.
1,Switching to Dickies Loose Straight Fit,Unfortunately Levis has made a huge mistake on downgrading not only the quality and thickness of the materials on the new 569s but also their sizes compared to their older 569s. If you buy new 569s starting Feb 2011 be prepared for paper thin material 569 Levis that will end up ripping in less than 1 year maybe. I also compared measurements them with my old 569s and they've taken off an inch from the legs widths. I hope they aren't using the trendy slim look excuse for this dumb decision. I bought these before because they were loose straight leg and now they aren't so I'm switching to Dickies brand loose straight that are not only the correct measurements but thicker and cheaper in price. Adios levis to more than 30 years of being a faithful customer...hello Dickies.Dickies Men's Loose Straight Fit Jean
4,classic,"these classic straight leg blue jeans are very comfortable, easy to wear and are a welcome addition to any wardrobe"
4,very nice but big box,The pants are of good quality and very nice. But the box where it was sent was very large. More than necessary. And I got very expensive to send up to where I am
2,not worth the price,"Wasn't much of a ""book"" more like an (expensive) news article. Read it in less than 30 minutes. Not worth it.Didn't learn very much. Would not recommend this."
1,Never Got It!,"I never got this book. Amazon kept sending me delay notices and after about 2 months, I canceled order."
4,A Quick Read and Enjoyable,"Really enjoyed this book. Hard not to like these characters. I laughed, cried, and could not put this book down. The chemistry between Jane and T.C. was great. My first book by this author. I look forward to reading others."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I advise you, please do not purchase this DVD.You are wasting your money on 4 episodes, a locker poster, and some interactive game.Season 1 of Life with Derek is out and for just about $5 more you can get ALL the episodes of season 1 vs the 4. You also get the locker poster with Season 1, PLUS more interviews and behind the scenes things."
5,This Is the Straight up Chicano Album,"Honestly Lil Rob is one of the best. The originality he delivers is natural. When he said ""you can't keep a good man down"", that's exactly what he meant. I got all his albums, and I never ever go without a day of bumpin his stuff in my ride.........Keep on doin what you do ese. Pachucos Night, is my jam homie......it's good with the girls....HAHAHA Laterz"
1,Low-quality recording,"While I love the music and the performer himself, and I'm sure I would have been enthralled to listen in-person, the quality of this digital recording itself is very poor. Songs start with and have a continuous hum of ambient noise, the microphone seems overloaded frequently, and the depth of the piano is totally missing. Listening to these songs, I keep wanting to adjust my speakers or look for a bad connection. There is no bad connection, however -- the songs are just badly recorded.I suggest you move on."
3,too slow for me,"I am not going to write a lengthy and erudite piece regarding this CD. As you probably know, the tempo adopted by Arrau is quite a bit slower than you'd normally hear. For me, this is the wrong tempo and therefore I cannot recommend this CD unless this is to be your second version of the nocturnes. If we look beyond the tempo the playing is beautifully done. Lots of atmosphere and sensitivity which bring the music to life. Yet, at this tempo one does not get a feel for the nocturnes as wholes. The same problem is encountered in Fourier's rendition of Bach's cello suites. On first listen these slow paced interpretations sound exotically interesting but as one listens more often one begins to see that the compositions do not breathe properly. The sense of a whole is lost."
2,huh????,This is my 3rd. ok by Cook. I love the way he writes. This book was going along fine..suspense building...foreshadowing all over the place....then the end came and i was like WTF?????I have no idea what this ending means.Skip this and read a David Wiltse book. Like Edge of SleepSadly I will not be buying anymore of Cook's books after this.
2,not entirely compatible with osx5,"hey, if you get this for five bucks you can play some old atari games on the mac. don't spend any more. macplay is out of business and there are no updates. Sadly, many of the emulations don't work with the new intel macs/osx5. But some, like Pitfall, do (Pitfall 2 doesn't as far as I can tell, which is what I really wanted to play!). Wish there was a way to turn off the mtv soundtrack."
4,Peppermint flavoring that is unpleasant,This product helps with joint pain but once in awhile a capsule generates a strong peppermint flavor once I have swallowed it. This generally results in heartburn. It does not happen too frequently but is unpleasant when it does - enough that I considered not reordering.
5,What a deal !!!!!,"Could not have gotten a better deal. It has been working for the last 2 months. Very quite, I leave it in the bedroom. Can't beat the price.Recommended for those automatic watch lovers, you can buy 4 of these for the price of an others model."
4,1/12 months later,"I would give this watch winder 8 stars but I have only had it a short time.If it keeps working the way it has,it will be the best winder I own at any price.(I own 3 winders at this time)"
3,"Good, but definitely some QA issues","I'm not really sure what it is, whether there was a bad run or what, but I've just broken my 2nd tuner. The first one died about 6 months after I bought it. It began to intermittently detect the signal from my guitar. One second it would pick it up, the next it was like I had nothing plugged in, and yet other times the indicator would wobble back and forth from min to max. No amount of jostling or going to different rooms(I thought it might have been some kind of interference) helped any. So I ordered another one(at $10, why not). I just got it last week and after a few days of flawless performance, it is now exhibiting the same issues as the first.These are cheap, but I guess they're just not for me. I'm going to try out the more expensive Fender ones next."
3,it might be a little too precise,"I think it has good quality, but maybe my tuning pegs don't match its sensitivity because I couldn't get the green light to stay and sometimes the red lights would come on haphazardly. (This was in the mode of using the built-in microphone, so the outside noises might have made a difference.) On the plus side I could tune both an acoustic guitar and a five string bass. The product is very accurate and is well made. It was helpful to include batteries."
4,Easy to use,"Easy to use for a beginner. There are some neat modifications to play around with, but for now basic tuning is enough for me. Couldn't play without it."
5,great tuner for a beginner!,"The tuner came with its own batteries and is very easy to use. It actually sounds like my husband is playing music now, instead of making noise on his out of tune guitar. Being in tune makes a huge difference and this tuner makes sure he's in tune ALL the time. Love it!"
4,"Awesome, long life, accurate tuner","This guy has been a part of my guitar case for several years now, and has been a required part of my practice and playing acoustic guitar. Accurate, easy to use, etc. It's met my needs well. However, I've taken to using my phone apps for similar features and only bring this out when my phone is dead or inaccessible."
2,Do not buy for Acoustic!,"I can imagine this is a great tuner if you are able to plug it into your guitar. The "" MIC"" is very weak and only recognizes the standard EADGBE tuning structure. I bought this tuner for the purpose of tuning my Taylor acoustic to some different tuning scales. It failed!"
4,Korg CA 30 Tuner,"What can I say? It does the job and for 10 bucks you can't beat it. Doesn't get a 5 'cause it can't be used in-line on a pedal board, but hey, it'll get you tuned up quick otherwise."
4,Easy to use,I am a beginning guitarist and I bought this to help me learn how to tune the guitar. It is fairly simple to use. just pluck the string and it'll tell you if its off or not. Good product overall. There are no doubt better ones for a higher price.
4,Viva Colima Pues,"Este Grupo es de colima de donde es mi madre. Este disco me gustan unas que otras canciones. Las primera seis o siete canciones estan bien, las ultimas como si el grupo no le metio muchas ganas con las palabras y el ritmo que le adaptaron a la musica. Este grupo esta envuelto con la ""onda grupera,"" tres canciones son cumbias, como unas cinco o seis son baladas, y las otras son rancheras. Si le gusta la musica grupera, Pues le recomiendo que se compres este disco compacto, porque esto es como de los ultimos grupos que conosco que tienen buena musica grupera."
5,WOW! TASTEEEE!,So this is what puffed wheat is suppose to taste like! This is the real deal not those candy junk cereals like Super Golden Crips or Honey Smacks which are 70% sugar. This cereal tastes way better
2,Big difference from the first two books,"I really loved the first two books in the series. Like those, I liked the plot & writing in this book, however, the sex scenes were a turn-off and I felt the descriptions of them were unnecessary. Having them in the book was fine for the plot but there was too much writing about them for me. I would have liked to recommend this last book in the series to my teenage kids but I won't because there were too many gratuitous sex details. The first two books did not have such graphic sex scenes and I felt they were better for that."
3,Should have been a Harlequin Romance title...,"I suppose to put it best is that this is not your typical Harlequin Presents novel. Maybe things were different in October 2003, but I thought this was quite slow. As for Jacques, I just couldn't understand or feel how he can come to ""love"" Holly so quickly. As for Holly, I hate when authors take a character with some serious emotional and psychological problems and think that love will solve it all. She was sexually abused as a child (I am sorry if I am giving something away here) and that just does not disappear nor does it make future relationships easy. I commend Jacques's character for being understanding and incredibly patient. It was a sweet story that really should have been a Harlequin Romance novel instead. Bad assignment on the part of Harlequin. If you enjoy a sweet story, you will most likely like this. The ending will leave a smile on your face."
2,Roving Mars,"Hear the author give a presentation on this project and enjoyed it very much. He wetted everyone's appetite to learn more about this Mars program. However, the book was too technical for me so I began to lose interest since I did not understand what was going on. It is geared towards someone who understands higher mathematics and physics."
1,great product! deceiving when it comes to the color!,"I received this product very fast, sooner than I expected. YSL lipstick is the BEST kind of lipstick, the color in the picture is VERY deceiving, it is not ""shocking pink"" it looks VERY RED when you receive it. I was so disappointed. I'm not a fan of red lipstick, but whatever. The brand YSL is hands down the BEST smoothest and long lasting lipstick I have ever purchased!"
5,Excellent Baroque Collection,"As I have stated in many of my previous reviews, I am a huge fan of the Sony Essential Classics (SEC) budget series. Most of the recordings feature classic and often definitive performances featuring the likes of George Szell, Leonard Bernstein, Robert Casadesus, Isaac Stern and Rudolf Serkin among others. Here we get a variety of orchestras and conductors including big names like Jean-Claude Malgoire, Raymond Leppard, Pierre Boulez, Sir Charles Groves and the great Eugene Ormandy. This disc features excellent performances of what is arguably the most popular Baroque music ever written. I am not usually one to give five-star ratings to greatest-hits style collections (particularly in classical), but the half-dozen performances by Ormandy make this disc a great purchase for both novices and serious collectors."
3,recommended by Steinbeck,"Nobel prize-winning author John Steinbeck read a copy of this book while in Russia, a trip that was later reported in ""Russian Journal""; Steinbeck describes the book as a wonderful 2000-year-old epic poem; the author is an icon of Georgian [SSR] national literature"
5,Fits well and snug,I bought these for leaf blowing. They work well even with wearing a hat. Stops most noise and do not hurt your ears even after wearing them for hours.
1,Peice of junk!,"I bought this camera for my kids for Christmas and it doesn't work. I've tried calling customer support and I never get an answer. I waited for an hour on hold and no answer ever. I downloaded the software, but when I plug the camera in my computer says no device defected! What a total waste of money!"
5,"Finally, a Silent Fan","I tried out 2 different 80mm fans before I bought this one for my media center. I started with a fan from an old Dell, a 100mm that turned out to be quieter than the ""silent"" 80mm fans. The 120mm has a lower speed that probably helps with the noise. The noise difference is amazing. I guess large and slow is better than small and fast when it comes to noise.The 2 80mm fans I tried were the Stealth and the Cooler Master. Of those 2, the Stealth was the quieter one. The Cooler Master was pretty noisy."
1,Incomplete Benson,Season 2 I received from WB had episode 1 missing. Disc 3 episodes were out of order and the last 2 episodes were episodes 1&2 from season 3.Shame on WB for releasing such a awful release. What are the customers who bought the season already suppose to do??
1,desserve better,"Excellent tv series...was lucky to get a perfect set from importcds...no scratches, no glitches...disc 3 episodes in wrong order ( 19 - 21 - 20 - 22 - 18 instead of 18 - 19 - 20 - 21 - 22 )...watched each episodes 3 times, perfect every time on all 3 different dvd players. So why 1 out of 5 ? I absolutely hate -r dvd's. This wonderful series desserves a much better treatement on dvd video or on blue ray."
3,Broke,Two large parts were broke...they sent replacements that were off color...not worth the money really overall.
1,Pet pads don't work,"I have a little Yorkie that I have trying to pad train. She is very afraid of thunderstorms so when it is raining I would like to have an alternative place for her to do her business. I have successfully pee pad trained a dog before. I tried the scented puppy training pads thinking they should accelerate her training. She did sniff the pad and then promptly walked away. If anything, it seemed more like a detractor than an attractor. They did not work at all with my dog."
5,great choice for massage session!,"I am very happy with this compilation. The album length is excellent for a 60min massage. The music is lovely and relaxing, and allows for a nice pace for performing massage. I have enjoyed it outside the massage room as well :) Overall, great product, great price!"
2,Measure Your Cabinets - It May Not Fit ! ! !,"Although this product says it's 11"" wide, your cabinets need to be much wider than 11"" for it to fit and have the door open. Under our sink, there is a divider in the middle between the 2 doors. Although each door opening is wider than 11"", the divider keeps us from being able to install the Rack Sack, as the door is not wide enough to be able to open the door with the Rack Sack on it due to the depth of it. All of our cabinets are designed like this, so we couldn't put it in any of our bathroom cabinets, either. I was very disappointed. It is now sitting in our garage waiting to be either given as a gift to someone or until we remodel our kitchen! It's not worth the expense to return it."
4,Campy but fun.,"Certainly, a direct-to-DVD movie does not inspire confidence. But the lowered expectation actually allows me to enjoy it.The budget being 1/6 of the original movie, the special effects are predictably bad. The actors, the writing and the directing will surely win no awards. But these are not what we watch Starship Troopers for. What makes the original movie such a cult favorite was the tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top campiness. This movie provides the same campy fun as well as fake blood by the buckets. If the viewer can suppress his inner snooty critic, he may find two hours of good time here."
1,omg I want my money back,This was 1 of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. I can not believe that someone would ever even consider publishing this movie. Someone was drunk at the box office.
2,"A ""B"" movie at best","Was it kind of fun to watch? Sure. Overall, it is not a good movie. If you must watch it, you would be better off renting it-not buying it. It reminded me of a high school play. The acting is poor and the plot predictable. Really, the film is just plain silly. Having seen it once, I don't ever need to see it again."
3,Ehh.. I don't know.,"I thought this would be ok since they brought back Rico but it just really didn't catch my attention.. I won't say it's terrible but nowhere close to the first film. The bug cgi was crappy though.. People hated Starship Troopers 2 but it's by far better than this one. So I say 3 stars for effort, with more of a budget and better story it coulda been great."
3,Fan Review,Ok....I think #3 is a reprieve from a Bad #2....but not as good as #1....collected so I could watch the whole series when it is rainy and very cold here in alaska....lol...
2,Could have been better,"In short, it is worth renting and watching 1 time. Purchasing this movie? My vote is no. I was hoping to finally see the power suits (as described in the book) finally used. Only about the last 5 to 10 minutes show the suits, so you will be disappointed in the duration. They are cool to watch though.It was not as gory as the first movie which I thought was overdone. Seeing Caspar Van Dien back was neat, but he could have been more incorporated into the story. The story does tend to wander. I got tired of the whole use of God and religion in the story. It got rather stupid after a while.Rent it and watch it if you are a Starship Troopers fan. After that, you decide if it is worth buying. For me, I am taking it back to the Red Box kiosk and bid it farewell."
4,A Better Sequel,"I'm a huge fan of the first film, and after seeing the two sequels, this is the better of the two. It makes more of an exact sequel than Hero of the Federation does, and it's just as campy as the first. It's great that Casper is back doing what his character does best: kicking some bug. Definitely worth it."
1,Bad! BAd! BAD!,"If you loved the first movie very much (I did) and is a Starship Troopers fan, don't watch this! Bad special effects, not many actions, bad acting, very SLOW. And the worst part is that some of the things look FAKE. For example, look at the guns closely. It appears to be made out of plastic! It's NOT worth watching. And, yeah, just as bad as the second one. Maybe worse."
1,Crap,This movie has NOTHING to do with either the first movie or the novel with the single exception that it has a character who's last name is Rico.
1,Professor Layton,This Professor Layton was a huge disappointment. No interaction for theviewer and it was a waste of money. The other Laytons were entertaining and a challenge.
2,Not impressed,"Looks great, feels great, well protected with a pseudo-armor coating but the optic quality is poor, the focusing aspects are poor ... not very good - will probably give them away soon and buy something else."
1,Got to be Fiction,This book has got to be fiction! It has no mention of donuts in the whole thing. Phat Phil can't live without donuts.
4,I LIKE PHIL AND THAT'S THAT,"I knew Phil and his first wife Renee when we were neighbors at one of U.T.'s married students' apt complexes. He was a fine father to son Phillip, Jr. and a good husband. He shares from his personal experiences what it takes to get to where he is and I'm thankful he's kept the dream alive for the U.T. Vols. As for the silly comments and fat Phil remarks, it sounds like jealous and mean spirited people don't want Coach Fulmer to shine. Sorry guys/gals, but victory is the best revenge and Phil is not a vengeful person but someone who keeps his focus on the goal. Count the number of NFL players who have been first round draft picks from the Vols roster and that tells you of Coach Fulmer's accomplishments. Johnny Majors picked Fulmer to replace him- that's that.If kindness upsets you naysayers, then read the Enquirer where falsehoods are the order of the day."
4,Subtle but effective,"My library is 1 block from my house. It is able to supply me with almost any book I want to read for free, therefore it isn't often I purchase books. I got this book from the library and after reading a chapter, I decided to return it and buy my own copy so I could write in it and highlight what I wanted. I believe the techniques and messages from the book do work. Her chapter on ""getting rid of what drains you"" makes so much sense. For several months I've been applying this principle to the many different areas of my life. I truly feel burdens (often self-imposed) lifting off me and am actually amazed by it. Also, another reason I bought the book is because at the end of each chapter Cheryl recommends additional books on the chapter subject matter. I always find at least one or two books from her list that I want read for further insight."
4,Xenna Curlaway,The product does what it says. Don't expect drastic changes quickly but it loosened your hair right after a few applications and with no hair loss. It is great as a leave-in conditioner. The smell is not pleasant but a few drops of vanilla extract makes it bearable. Overnight application is a bit messy and the smell.... I will continue using it mostly as a leave-in conditioner.
2,Think about it,FIrst off i had to repay shipping when the package arrived at my house. I ended up paying about 25$ in total and paid shipping twice. I would recommend to just buy some in Walmart they have it there other relaxers for 5$ and honestly they work the same. i have been using this product for a while just about everyday and yes it smells really bad but it does leave my hair shiny and silky. But the chemical smell is not very healthy. other than having to pay twice for shipping its ok quality if you want to use this relaxer for managebility then its perfect for you but if you are using it to get your hair less curly i can tell you that it is going to take to long so just look for a different product.
2,Not for Me,The product does work but I can't take the smell. I also don't like the fact that you have to use it daily.
3,Nitzer Ebb turned Depeche Mode.,"I was really disappointed when I found out that Flood was not going to produce 'Ebbhead'. He ran off with U2 to produce 'Achtung Baby', and in his wake, Depeche Mode genious Alan Wilder stepped in and produced the 'Ebbhead' album, which made it sound like a pumped up Depeche Mode record.I think that the DM song 'Rush' wouldn't sound the way that it does if Wilder had not worked with Nitzer Ebb on this project.Alan Wilder previously worked with the Ebb on the 'As Is' ep, producing the song 'Come Alive'.The flipside on the single 'Straycat Blues' is really cool, and is a great cover to an old Stones song."
2,French workbook,"The workbook came in reasonable time, but I was frustrated to find that a good deal of the book had been written in -- 30 pages or so, although the seller stated that there was ""very little"" in the way of markup. The seller also made no attempt to erase any of her writings, or to cover them with white-out. It has been tedious to photocopy new pages and put them in the book. Please be more accurate in the future, and I will purchase my books elsewhere."
5,Essential for Cooking Authentic Cuban Food,"This cookbook is considered a traditional gift for newly-married Cuban American women. Additionally, it is essential for anyone who wants to cook authentic traditional Cuban food. It is written in Spanish and the book provides basic recipes and daily menu suggestions, as well as more elaborate dishes. As a Cuban American woman, I can say that this book contains a great array of staple dishes, and it is a must-have for cooking real Cuban food. I wish an English version were available."
3,Public Domain Material Repackaged by Publisher,"Much of this material is available for the researcher in libraries. Also, the publisher is reaping a profit using public domain material, repackaging it, throwing in a CD-ROM,etc. Easy profit margin--you don't have to generate the material at your expense (the tax payer paid for it, the publisher repackages it, and sells it back to the tax payer). Well, I at least give 'em credit for being smart marketers."
2,Lousy toaster,"I like the look and feel of the this toaster oven. Was excited to receive it for a present. But can you imagine designing a toaster oven that doesn't toast well!? The top of the bread was fine, but the underside was only partially toasted. I am so unimpressed with Black and Decker products. Like Chrysler (at least of old), they have nice designs but are poorly executed."
2,Great Voice; Lousy DVD,"A lame, wheelchair concert where geriatric Rod can't seem to get any juice going. Geeeez: he could have at least rehearsed for this show. Forgetting the words to a song and starting over is, hmmm, unacceptable. Even if VH1 tries to use it as a way of showing how ""laid back"" this ""session"" was.Look at Rod's lame version of ""Hot Legs"" in the Extras section - he just ain't got the chops at this time to cover the vocalese. That being said: he does one incredible song, that I can't find anywhere, ostensibly from a group called, ""Primal Scream"": Get Your Rocks Off. It is a blistering rocker, well in Rod's vocal range for this period, and, probably worth the price of admission. Now: does anyone know where I can find it?I love Rod. One of the greatest Rock and Roll voices ever. Just not on this DVD. Put it in your NetFlix queue. . .and save yourself a couple bucks."
1,"Tiresome bunk! Total waste of time,","Thin, cliche plot. Poorly researched by one who never served, who obviously has no particular affections for the US Army.Couldn't even convince myself to finish it."
5,The Enemy,See storyline above.As mentioned elsewhere this is a compelling and very satisfying thriller that won't disappoint Lee Child fans. The story has some interesting twists along with a narrative that will keep you glued to the pages.Highly recommended.
1,Not that good,"Have read ever Childs book, liked them all, especially Reacher. This plot seemed a bit convoluted to me. Wholesale transfers throughout the service with a master plan of deceit and deception.Did not seem plausible to me but I may be wrong. As a result I did not care for the book or the plot."
4,Starts with a bang and keeps going,"I bought this as a road trip read. It grabbed me from the first page and kept my attention. Nice short chapters for quick meal stops, but the tendency to keep reading makes for extended stops when I should be heading down the road."
3,Kind of slow for a Reacher story,"It was a plodding kind of story that was entertaining enough to read until the end, but not a page turner."
3,TOO CONVOLUTED,"STRONG CHARACTER BUT THE PLOT Z IGZAGS HERE, THERE & EVERYWHERE.THE BASIC PREMISE(ARMYPOLICY AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL) SEEMS TOO CONTRIVED. BELIEVE LEE CHILD HAS WRITTEN BETTER!!"
4,Another great Reacher read,"As with all Reacher stories, Childs does an excellent job with the story, the details and the characters. Well done."
2,Not his usual,"I was surprised at the number of people who thought this was 4 or 5 star. I love Child's Reacher books, but this one didn't cut it for me. It dragged on and on. Maybe if you are military and liked reading about endless boring descriptions of clothing, equipment and scene details you might like it. I found myself skipping over pages of descriptions just to get to the end."
5,Lee Child Jack Reacher #8,"Again, one of my favorites by Lee Child. Have read almost all his books and waiting for the next book in Dec."
2,Too Much of a Reach,"The story just doesn't hold together. At one point Reacher goes out to arrest a murder suspect who is heavily armed. Rather than take back-up he goes out alone. Well, that's stupid, but it's the only way that Child can give us his slam-bang fight-to-the-death ending. Pretty boring if a squad of MP's surround the guy and he quietly gives up. Another unlikely bit is his arrest of the wrong person who committed a crime, yes, but not one Reacher wants to prosecute. Still it's a pretty serious one. Why wouldn't some other MP pick up the same pieces Reacher did and find out that Reacher let someone go for a gruesome crime (although maybe justified)? That sort of thing is understandable, even excusable from the vagrant vigilante Reacher, but not the MP Major.It is interesting to get the background on Reacher, and some of the characters do show up in a later novel, but it could have held together a lot better than it did."
2,The Enemy,"I am a big fan of Lee Child and his Jack Reacher novels, but this is the first one I have read that was sub-par. I still have two of his books left to read and my hope is that he will come back to his performance levels of the past.I realize it is hard to turn out one good book after another, but we all love Jack Reacher and our expectations are high!"
3,ac rates the enemy,"I like reading the Reacher series, but it seems the stories keep going back in time.First brother Joe is killed, then a few books later it's earlier time and he's alive, now it seems so is their mother who passes away while Jack and Joe are there???Also it seems that with each book, Childs gets wordier and wordier rambling on to describe inconsequential things at times that have no bearing on the plot at hand.In his effort to make the ""Reacher"" series more interesting, he seems to be ignoring his best series which is the ""Agent Pendergast"" storiesthe enemy was fair, not his best work nor his least. what else can I say."
2,It's good until the end,"I enjoyed this story more than most Reacher books, I liked seeing him when he was an MP. However the ending was just horrible.***ending spoiler***So Reacher has a problem with denying that a fight with a civilian happened in order save his military career, but has no problem committing 1st degree murder of a superior officer. Really? The ending really lost me and was very disappointing."
1,"I said, he said, she said, we said...","I couldn't get past the first 10 pages of this book - the author has the worst writing style I have ever encountered. The fact that this book got published, let alone is the eighth in the series amazes me...Apart from the clumsy writing in general, what stands out most is his use of the word 'said'. The author uses it after nearly every line of dialog - it is enough to drive you mad. Even a primary school child mixes it up a bit, and the English language has a vast array of descriptive terms to choose from. The other big gripe I have is that the book seems to be written entirely in the first person, a style that I find very irritating to read.Now I only read the first chapeter (it was sent to me as a 'sampler') but I didn't even finish that. So perhaps it gets better but I really really doubt it.Do yourself a favor and find a better book."
2,Disappointed with this one,"I am a hugh Jack Reacher fan and read all his books. This one had too much of Lee Childs political opinions in it. As a retired Naval Officer, I do not need someone elses opinion on US foreign policy in the novels I read."
5,"Wear your seat belt when you read ""The Enemy"" by Lee Child","It's hard to give any Jack Reacher novel a bad rating because each one brings the reader a special something that isn't expected.""The Enemy"" is another winner from the Jack Reacher stable. Except this time, it has a few more twists and turns, a few more bad guys and good guys and a deeper, more personal look into Reacher's life.I'm hookd on Jack Reacher novels and after you read ""The Enemy< I'm guessing you will be, too."
5,Reacher on Active Duty,"Lee Child's hero is Major Jack Reacher, who finds himself in dangerous situation along with his young, smart, assistant, Lieutenant Summer. No one is who they seem to be, and the story develops into an all night read! This is one of the best!"
2,First Reacher book I didn't like...,"... and I read Reacher 1-7 (and 16 by mistake) beforehand and loved them all. This one just gets too complicated with differering military groups, names, ranks, responsibilities etc. So much so that they get in the way of what is basically a very inventive tale, as all Child's books are. Skip this one if you are doing them in order. I am even going ""off Reacher"" for a while before I pick up on this series again, which I nonetheless am certain will not dissapoint."
4,The Enemy,To be sent back to the days when Reacher was still in the Army was a treat. I hope we see more of it. I like the first person approach. Excellent plot lines as usual and of course that trademark Reacher dialog. I was not disappointed.
4,Lots of Plots Intertwined in This One...,"I enjoyed it, but there sure were a lot of plot lines moving around. Reacher has an uncanny way of teasing out the clues and finding the truth... but it does seem a bit far-fetched, especially at the end when he's mixing it up with the highest levels of the military. Interesting backstory on his mom, though."
4,Not as suspenseful,"While this book of the series isn't as suspenseful, I felt the research done was still impeccable. I honestly half expected Reacher to shed a tear but I'm somehow not surprised he didn't."
4,Excellent read,I've only started to read Lee Child's Reacher series but in one word. Excellent. I love the tough guy character who isn't beyond going above and beyond what needs to be done. I've read at least three in this series and I will get the rest of them very soon. The Enemy pits him against a corrupt group in the military who will try to cover up a plot to change the military. Everyone has a price. Not Jack Reacher.
4,A great read for a long plane ride,"I picked this book up for a long plane ride and was a few pages in before I realized that I'd read it before. However, Lee Child's writing is so sharp and Reacher's detection is so intelligent AND practical that I couldn't put it down and reread the whole story. Totally absorbing.For those who think that television shows on the work of military intelligence provide a good picture of what they do, I'd suggest reading this book for a much more insightful and exciting story, fascinating mystery - and, if you haven't read other Reacher books, an introduction to a great character."
2,Very Repetitive,"OK story. A lot of fluff. In one section, ""I said nothing"" apeared on almost every other sentence. This book can be cut down quite a bit by getting rid those repetitive sentence."
2,OK....,"Maybe it's just me, but I disliked this CD. I suppose it just wasn't for me. I mean, come on. It's half as long as almost ANY CD on the market, and they charge just as much for it? No. Shave off like a buck or three. Anyway, I wouldn;t buy this CD if I were anyone. Go and buy some really good musical scores from movies."
5,What song is used in the Matrix trailer?,"Does anybody know? What a brain teaser- a lot of the trailers I see use such awesome songs, but I can't recognize them. By the way, since I'm asking, does anyone know which song was used in the trailer for the X-files movie too?"
1,You will be DISAPPOINTED,"Most of the people, including me, like the movie MATRIX very much. But unfortunately, not all the products that were related to MATRIX were as good as the movie at all, including the cd soundtrack that was on sale right now in different music store. Most of the music in the MATRIX cd was so boring and just keep repeating. Probably only one or two songs sounds more exciting. So if you are a big MATRIX fan and want to keep a good impression of the movie MATRIX, I suggest that DON'T BUY ANY SOUNDTRACKS OF MATRIX AT ALL!"
5,Excellent CD... glad I got it,"This CD has great music on it. I purchased this AND the soundtrack together to save on shipping, and because I had the extra $$ to spend LOL. I am certainly glad I threw this in with the soundtrack. The tracks on the CD are just great, and it is awesome listening"
2,Pamper chef large jug,"I went to a P.C. Home party and was impressed with the standard of the products and range of easy recipes. I ended up buying the large batter jug and small glass bowls with lids. Having now used the jug I was so disappointed with the inferior way it pours. There was a mess everywhere, really not what I was expecting. Could not recommend this for the price"
3,"Fine, but her earlier recording is better","Sutherland is just fine in this recording, but I still love the 1961 recording conducted by Sir Pritchard ( preferable to Bonynge). Sutherland is in fresher voice and, more importantly, her attack on the high notes is exciting in its fearlessness, more so than on the Bonynge set."
5,The Solace of Leaving Early,"This novel was one of the best I've ever read. Having Haven come into one of my classes was amazing. She is very funny and talented. I would recommend this book to anyone, and if you get a chance to hear Haven speak, do it."
5,The solace of finding a great book,"I am so glad I found this book and Haven Kimmel--what a writer. The prose is wonderful, the kind of writing where you go back over sentences to feel the beauty and the craft of a perfect phrase--over and over. I haven't read a book like this in so long, it had no cliches, no tiresome plot devices, just a funny, sad, sweet, well thought out story. Kimmel brings the characters together in a perfectly believeable way, it always rings true. Spend a few days (you don't want to give this book up too soon) with Langston, Amos, Germane, Alice's the sweet wounded daughters and all the major and minor characters that are written so clearly. Read it at least once!"
1,The solace of finishing something dull,"I wholeheartedly agree with Bruce's and Customer's reviews. The book is painfully dull with unbelievable dialogue, especially between the protagonist and the girls. The Marian apparitions didn't even have that much to do with the story. It was mostly about the protagonist's unhappiness with small-town life We learn that she had an affair with a cad whilst at graduate school. She walked out of her exams because she couldn't stand to see the cad with his new woman, married and pregnant. It took me forever to finish this book. Do yourself a favor and skip this book. You're not missing much!"
2,The Solace of Leaving Early,"Well I've read some of the other reviews and don't wish to just reiterate what they said. However I would like to comment on the ending without giving it away - it came from out of the blue and was really quite preposterous. I can think of a half dozen endings that would have been better, would have been more believable - actually I have seen X-Files episodes that were more likely. Or for that matter, it was nearly as preposterous as the story lines in the new series ""Boomtown"" and ""Without a Trace"" this season. Since when did fiction become ""stranger than fact?"""
2,this book was so mediocre....sigh,"The best thing about this book is the title. It's a beautiful sentiment and one that was expressed well in one little vignette. Otherwise this book was so mediocre...OMG. It was bad. Simplistic. Saccharine. It was like reading the work of someone still in the first year grad writing program, as the main character reflects. Not only could you see the plot wrap-up a mile away, I sort of felt like I needed to take a shower afterwards lest I get attacked by a swarm of bees coming for the sticky sweetness.This book is a major pass unless you typically enjoy the recommendations of USA Today."
5,You Won't Leave This Novel Early!!!!,"The highest praise I reserve for a novelist is to say that he/she reminds me of Anne Tyler. Haven Kimmel falls into that august category with her BRILLIANTLY rendered fist novel ""The Solace of Leaving Early"" which is at once a love story and an examination of the nature of grief.Quirky and enduring characters populate Kimmel's small Midwestern town. One cannot fail to be moved by young Immaculata and Epiphany as they face their darkest days.And ahhh the character of Langston! She is one of the most interesting, funny and aggressively irritating characters I've come across in a long long time. I hated to close the book on her.This is one novel that you won't ""leave early""."
1,The tradeoff between quality and publicity,"Bravo, Sarah Bryan Miller! It is amazing how patheticlly we have been victimized with publicity, to the degree that this awful record has been a success in the music stores. The only plus that I find is that people that have never heard opera are listening for the first time to some of the most fascinating arias. The problem is that there are Jörlings, young Pavarottis and Carreras or di Stefanos that can really take us to the marvelous world of opera, who contrast with this good effort that will never become a big one."
2,Pretty torpid stuff,"Sorry, but even though I love Andrea Bocelli like a maniac, I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone who'd rather hear Luciano Pavarotti at age 30-something. 'Nuff said."
2,Monitor Freeze,"I really like The price also great features. one thing I don't like the monitor freeze up on the tv viewing, when this happen you loss control of the unit you have to shut it off by unplug or if you have a surge breaker power switch. I return the LCD Monitor/Tv for a replace to my surprise the second one had the same problem."
1,No go,"This book is hopelessly dated, with progressive muscle relaxation and positive affirmations.Not what I was looking for."
1,Maybe she was sleepy when she wrote it,"There has got to be some kind of excuse as to why this book sucked so bad. It was horrible! A waste of good bookstore space. I think that Kiki Swinson needs to step up her game. Hopefully her next book will be better, I'm always willing to give a new author another try. If you want to read a good book get...1) Deadly Reigns by Teri Woods2) Dutch 1 and 2 by Teri Woods3) Dirty Money by Ashley JaQuavis4) or any of Nikki Turner's books."
1,Boring,This book was so boring that I had to skim through pages just to finish this bullsh#t. This book was extemely boring do not waste your time reading this one.
3,It was ok,"Ok, maybe its just me, but I thought this book could have been alot better. I mean don't get me wrong, it was an ok read for the most part, but I thought it should of had a little more umph to it."
3,OK,"This was a ok book first time reading anything by Kiki Swinson. Good story line that tells about Kira the wifey to a big time well known drug dealer name Ricky. They been married for 7 years and Kira been dealing with him sleeping around having babies after babies with other women but, Kira sticks around until she can't handle it no more. Her cousin gets locked up for helping Ricky with his dope runs. Kira helps to give information about Ricky so he can get locked up. Kira falls for one of Rickys guys name Russ that sets Kira up and takes all of Ricky's and Kira money.This book puts you in the mind of the wifey to a drug dealer take you to the other side instead of us always following the drug dealer. But, in away wishing it had more action involved tell you the truth. Also noticed a lot of misspelled words hoping it wasn't just my book give it a 3 because I think it was ok not bad but, ok. Hoping the other sequels is a little bit better.Now ready to read I'm Still Wifey. :)"
2,Umm No,"This book was not all it was cracked up to be. I would not waste my money on it. The cover had me amped to read it but when I began, it was very hard for me to finish. I do not like books that cant keep my attn. This one definitely did not."
1,I hope she steps her game up,"This cover is Hot! I must admit I thought I was about to read something special, but this book was so terribly written. It was so plain and whack. "" I did this, I did that. I really think the publisher should reconsider what they publish. This reflects on them. I will give KiKi another chance and I really hope she steps her game up. Good luck sister! But overall, this has to be the worst book I ever read ( honestly)."
1,One Star For The Cover Only,This book is why people are talking about AA fiction. The grammar and diction were horrible. The story was horrible and the only part I enjoyed were the last ten pages because I knew the story was almost over.
1,Disappointed,The book was given to me by my aunt and she said it was really good. Well halfway through the book I figured out what would happen. This book for me was a disappointment. It was too drawn out for me. Hopefully Ms. Swinson will do a better job on her next book.
3,Needs a little more work,"This book was okay. the problem with was that it had so many grammatical errors, you really could not enjoy it. Yeah, if your writing a urban book your going to use slang, but these words were so screwed up that the publisher should have changed it. The story line was cool, but next time please get an editor that acutally cares about how the book will turnout."
5,The FUNK BABY,This album is for a true Junie Morrison fan. This high techno funk at its best. I have the vinyl album and I have been in love with it ever since I had it. Great work out music. Junie is peeing on my afro...lol. Enjoy the album.Macdog
2,Disappointed,"I had purchased the regular coconut flakes which were so delicious that I decided to buy this product. Night and day difference! Granted this product is reduced fat, but it is soooo dry and rather bitter tasting. I will reorder the wonderful flakes which I eat right out of the bag and will try to use this up in baking."
4,great from start to finish,"I only wish I spoke Portuguese, she has a such an evocative voice and the rythym is compelling. my favourites would be Soi Na Tchada and Falso Testemunho but that is a tough choice!"
2,not worth the $,"Its an ok toy for maybe 30 seconds, alot in the toddler world too;) My daughter recieved this toy as a gift at about 14 months and now she's 22 months. She plays with it for less than a minute and moves on to just about anything else. She already knows all the animals and they are dificult to chew or play with. It seems more exciting or interactive then what it really is. Its really pretty huge as far as pretend toys go- Its been stored for months now. We only take out once in a blue moon, it just doesnt get played with, even though we have the tractor too. Have to say everything works ok, the sounds and movement its just my daughter finds it really dull. She actually polays with the Little People Farm toy way more And that doesnt even have sounds. Hope it helps"
1,Very disturbing and annoying,"I bought this book hoping to find a guide to meditation, inner journeys, and ""truly"" sacred places. What I found instead in this book were self-inflated personal anecdotes that were presented against the backdrop of the author's training in Jungian psychology. Very hard not to become angry. If I want personal tales on ""Christianity"", I can go to church. Finally, the book is typeset with a font that is illegible and disturbing. I'm really sorry I bought this book."
5,Bravo to Phillips for this wonderful series,"Not only am I delighted with this enchanting compilation but with the lullabies for lovers, chopin and champagne, beethoven for readers and bedtime. The list goes on. It is rare for compilations to pull off the cover promise but this series does from the upbeat mozart for breakfast and commuting to the soulfull and truly tranquil Debussy for Daydreaming I am overjoyed with each CD I have purchased. If you love classical music or would like to then this series is a treasure and great way to experience the best of the best"
4,Missing DVD,"This is a great series. But when I received my copy from Amazon, it included 2 DVDs that were the same. Missing was the DVD that included the features & interviews. I've contacted Amazon with no response.So I would encourage anyone to purchase the 1st season of Rome. Just be aware that if there is a problem, Amazon will be slow to respond if at all."
4,Rome 1st Season,I was looking into purchasing this item and looked at several stores. I decided to try amazon and they had the best price too! I received it in a timely manner also. I am now about to do some more shopping since i had a good experience.
5,EXCELLENCE,"I'VE WATCHED MANY SHOWS AND READ MANY BOOKS ON ROME BUT THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST TAKE ON ROME OF ALL TIME. THE SETTING FOR THIS SERIES IS JUST PHENOMENAL AND THE ACTORS PLAY THEIR PARTS SO WELL. I ENJOYED THE FIRST SEASON JUST AS MUCH AS ANY OTHER HBO SERIES. IT'S EMOTIONAL, FIERCE, AND SHOCKING. IT'S TELEVISION EXCELLENCE!! DON'T MISS OUT ON THIS FINE SHOW."
5,Love this series !!!,"I was only able to watch up to season one, when it came out on HBO a few years ago, and to my sunrise,there was a season 2.The first time i watched it, i was hooked, and got both series.If you love Roman History, you'd love this series, even though, it comes across like a ""soap opera,"" but what I like about it, it gave me an insight into Roman Life, and has sparked a renewed interest in Roman History, which I plan to learn more at a later time.I love the characters, especially Titus Polo, and Lvernius, it's too bad BBC stopped at Season 2...also, i noticed that these Roman Actors, have awesome British accents...lol.Very sad, even after 2000 years our human nature hasn't changed much...wars, greed, murder, corruption, poverty, etc, and as a Catholic, I'm amazed how much of Roman Religious Practices have been adopted by the Church."
5,Superior Television Drama,"A terrific series. Smart, funny, and historically accurate to a remarkable degree (for TV). Excellent visuals. All around some of the best TV I've seen in a long time."
5,Fablulam Mirabilem,"Entertaining, historically accurate except for the female wardrobe; the starlets complained that Roman womens' attire was unflattering to their bodies. Tough tintinabulas, toots! Rome was as sophisticated a society as any the world has yet produced, and some interesting parallels run through the series' storyline to the U.S. current state.Those who do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat it. Because western civilization borrows so much from Roman society, it would behoove us to heed their, and our, excesses, lest we become that which we admire: a time and people long gone."
2,Good series Very poor DVD box,The problem with this DVD box is that it is extremely hard to take the DVD out. I nearly broke a DVD in the process of taking it out. I cant understand why the DVD creator had to go and create a new way of storing DVDs when this art has been mastered for hundreds of years. I really want my money back for this DVD set.
1,Close caption defective on screen,I dont kno what is up with this dvd!!! It has a permanent yellow shaded box with large close caption letters on it!!! I tried to remove it and it still there! The cc is off on my tv & dvd player and the dvd itself! I find this very annoying and I ordered 1 b 4 and returned it cause I thought it was defective! I ordered another and the same thing again!!! Does anybody else hav this prob! Holla & let me kno! I cant enjoy the dvd with half the screen shaded in yellow with big letters ! This is crazy!!!!! I wonder if the blu ray's like this as well!!!!!
2,Boring,"Except for the ""Pilot"" episode, this series was all hype. I'm amazed at how many people got into this. The history wasn't even close, even giving artistic license. It became drudgery to sit through it. I will grant you I sat down to the whole affair, so I could be more in tune to the weakness of the subsequent episodes. I SOLD my copy, and was happy to get my money back."
3,Non-Existing Battle Scenes,"This show is perfectly cast, paced, and has a great plot. However, this is the story of Julius Caesar who was not born into power, he was not handed his throne as Emperor of the Roman Empire...he took it by force, crushed his enemies and dissolved the republic declaring himself Emperor.The writers and directors of this show should have taken some lessons from Peter Jackson, writer and director of The Lord of the Rings or Antoine Fuqua The director of King Arthur in how to properly film a battlescene. The battle scenes were either after the fact or a short montage of poorly executed fight scenes. This in my opinion severely hurt the quality of this show. There are those that may argue that this was because of a desired rating, but this was HBO with full frontal nudity. Sadly, and because of this I will not purchase the second season.-Kevin82"
2,Say what? Sex is still the number one seller,"It's all here. The breasts, the penises, the inane dialogue between the two main characters. Incest, rape, men with men, women with women, pedophiles, and all the blood and gore you can wallow in to your heart's content. They even say "" Say what?"" in the series to make you feel right at home. In between the swinging penises and breasts, the fall of Rome is told in all it's gory demise. Why did I watch it you ask? Because I paid for it and now I'll pass it on for someone else to enjoy or not. I'm now in the process of watching the second series. Because I paid for that set too. Somewhere, there must be a good book or movie about the fall of Rome without having a breast or penis flung in my face every 10 or 15 minutes. I know that these incidents did happen and they still are today but I don't feel that constantly showing them throughout the series had anything to do with the fall of Rome."
4,"First set defective, Amazon quickly replaced","This was a gift to my brother. The first set of discs had a defect that caused them to skip and not play properly. I called Amazon customer service and they sent out a replacement set right away. The 2nd set was perfect. My brother enjoyed the DVDs and said he thought though there was more graphic sex and violence than on regular TV, that was accurate to what went on in Roman times. I watched the series when it was on cable TV, and I thought the acting was excellent. My only complaint is the Roman women in it, according to history, were pious but they certainly are not portrayed that way in the series. However, it does make for good drama, though not accurate."
5,Excellent Show,"Finally a ""realistic"" show, bad language, blood, sex, nudity, sadist villains... Hold on, this is how life really is and was under ancient Rome ! This show is a must see, it gives a real change in comparison to all ""politically correct"" American shows. It might not be completely accurate historically, for those who complain about that: watch the History Channel ! Rome is entertainment, and really good one !"
1,"Rome, The First Complete Season","In many ways this production is excellent; however, its infatuation with the sexual promiscuity of the Roman world is excessive at the expense of other more important historical hallmarks of the classical period."
3,It was a pretty good book!,"Jessi makes fun of a teacher, not really trying to hurt his feelings. This book was good, but not totally realistic."
1,If Only I Could Have Given No Stars Instead,"This book is one long unsubstantiated socialist rant. (And I'm an Independent, not a Republican.)Keillor vents endlessly about how Bush and his fellow Republicans have ""broken the social contract"" with their fellow Americans.Say what? Bush's prescription drug benefit alone will cost over $500 billion in the next ten years. His administration has presided over the biggest increase in social spending since Johnson's Great Society. (And Bush has the record deficit to prove it.)However, Keillor - like all good Liberals - must assure us he's cornered the market on compassion.Self-indulgent, nauseating and totally unsupported by the facts. Save yourself twenty bucks and buy something else. Anything else . . ."
5,Excellent,This is especially great in audio because of the author's great voice and delivery. A wonderful work of art that reveals why the bullies won again and why nice guys finish last. Listen and learn to someone who thinks with heart and speaks with honest concern.
3,Entertaining prose but simplistic thesis,"The thesis can be summed up in just a few words: Democrats good. Republicans bad.Luckily, Keillor takes his time with the argument and I got the most enjoyment from the book reading the little stories and limericks that he uses to get his point across. The style is wonderful, but the content was very boring."
2,Same as others - 9 month life span,"Worked wonderful for 9 months. Well 8.75 months. Then some screen lag and synch errors with the sound for a week before dying. Dead Dead and Dead. The cost of repair is more then the value of the unit, under their warranty. I'd advise against getting this unit unless you don't need one that lasts for some reason."
2,died after 11 months,Died after 11 months of service :(didn't expect that for today's electronic products.
5,Great Monitor,"I recently purchased the Samsung 193P and couldn't be more happy!!! I am very picky when it comes to buying quality products and made sure I did my homework before I bought this LCD...The product arrived in less than a week with standard shipping and came out of the box with ZERO dead pixles (not very common at all)... There is no color bleed at the corners what so ever...Crystal clear picture!!!This is a work monitor, so I wasn't so concenrned with the refresh rate as I would be with a home gaming screen... But I couldn't resist giving it a try... Loaded World of Warcraft and EQ2 (both games very intense graphics) and was pleasantly surprised how great these games looked. There was almost no shading and the screen kept up fine at a 20ms refresh rate...This screen did cost a bit more than some of it's other comparable competition, but overall I can't stress on how much better this screen was than ALL of them...Money well spent..."
5,A Very Good Historical,"HE SAID YES is a very good historical. I enjoyed reading about a shop girl who finds her Knight in Shining Armor disguised as a Marquis. The hero in this book is delicious, strong and compassionate at the same time. The story and characters are compelling. A very enjoyable, well-written read."
4,Indulge...You will be Delighted !!!,"Another excellent tale written by Patricia Waddell. I have read her previous three He Said books, and of course just 'had' to read this one also.. and am glad I did. Well-written..fast-paced.. but the story of Evelyn, and Marshall..(Marquis of Waltham) kept my interest from beginning to end.. This is a Must Read book...and a definite recommend..Also recommended: He Said No, He Said Never, He Said Now"
5,It's edge-of-your-seat from page one until the end.,"Congratulations to Mr. Harrison's first book! A Russian sleeper agent attempts to steal a space shuttle with a ""Star Wars"" package. But an accident strands him in orbit. Now the U.S. and the Soviets race to bring down the ""Intrepid"" first. The characters are thoroughly believeable. Harrison does an incredible job of bringing them to life and making you care about them, including the Russian agent who steals the shuttle. The thrills, the twists, the turns, never stop. The climax is one of the most amazing I've ever read."
3,"Cute, but not pratical","i purchased this phone as an '03 princess themed christmas, and it's still ""working"". i'm just happy my daughter is only 2, becasue the phone is only for looks, i'm not too sure about the quality as some of the other reviews, because i don't get to talk on it long, being i hang up on everyone that i talk too (as the buttons are so out of place)....so if you're buying this as a decorative piece to sit near the lamp on the night stand, go right ahead, because it is definately CUTE"
2,Doesn't play burned DVDs-- even those burned using the machine,"I bought this in October of 2007 and by summer it ceased playing the very dvds I'd burned from VHS using the unit. Customer service sent me a disc to run which eliminated all dvd playing capacity. I returned it at a cost of $40 (i.e. the cost of a new but less ""prestigious"" dvd player) and they sent me another one. Nine months later it too stopped playing burned dvds. Now I use it only for manufactured dvds and vhs and am currently shopping for a player compatible with burned media.If anyone has a recommendation I would appreciate it."
2,product is not fresh,I buy this coconut at my local Whole Foods market and love it!!The product I received today is not fresh tasting at all!!I am bummed.....
4,Chilton's Repair and Tune-Up Guide Mercedes-Benz 1974-84,Very very good book. My colegues from work recomended because I own one Mercedes 123 240D from 1978.
4,Now this is as closes as you get!!!,"A beautiful tribute to The Supernatural. Oh yeah, it helps that Gary is using an actual guitar from the Green Manilishi himself. No wonder it sounds just like Green."
2,This Is Noise,"I am a Gary Moore freak. I loved his stuff with Thin Lizzy and his 80's Solo Rock stuff and his blues records like ""After Hours"", ""Still Got the Blues"" and ""Blues Alive."" But, this ""Blues for Greeny"" thing reeks! It sounds like it was recorded in his bathroom or maybe over the phone! And the songs are as weak as it gets. This one will find its way to the pawn shop quickly!"
5,Perhaps my all-time favorite novel,"I am thrilled to find this book is again readily available since it is one of my favorite gifts to new friends. If you're a fan of Southern Gothic, you will fall into the world of Jacko and his associated characters like a mayfly into sorghum molasses. Childress's ability to focus the reader upon the tiniest detail and then expand the vision, in only a few sentences, to encompass the universe is mind-blowing. Read this book. It's unique, compelling, challenging and moving. You will be so glad you did."
4,Handyman,"Bought this item real cheap as a backup for old IPOD MINI when I purchased replacement battery. It works fine, but not the quality of OEM stuff."
1,I'm still waiting for it to arrive.,"I'm still waiting for it to arrive.It has been more than a month, and still counting."
1,Please save yourself some money and don't buy,"The LED lights light up, but when i plug it into my ipod, no charging. Also, the retractable USB cable doesn't even fit into my ipod nano 3g. I spent a good hour trying to force it in, and make it a little smaller to fit in. It's not even the same size as the actual cord. Too bad when i use the cord that came with my ipod, it doesn't even charge."
3,iPod USB Charget Kit,"I bought this kit on a whim when I was purchasing another iPod accessory because I saw that the price was just too low to pass up.The wall charger works beautifully.The only complaint I have is that the car charger doesn't work in any of the three vehicles I have tried it in. I'm not sure what the problem with it is, but it's a bit annoying.But I only paid about $2 for all of it, so I'm not too disappointed."
3,Pretty good but not perfect,"I am happy with these products with one exception. One of the pieces is meant to be an extending cord to be used with charging. It is hard to use and feels like cheap plastic when you do use it. I do not like it at all.I have not yet used the car charger, but the wall charger functions fine."
1,YEAH ABOUT THIS ITEM....,"SO YEAH... maybe i just got a defective one, not sure but it worked for about 10 minutes. then my ipod touch said that charging was not supported so i was like wtf. this thing was cheap so i took a chance. but you know that sometimes its better to spend that extra money. gonna order a more expensive one, prob like 10 bucks but if that one doesnt work then i will flip out. oh and there is nothing wrong with my ipod, i know what your thinking. look man we will fight.....ok awkward....jk ok but i dont recommend this item. oh and also for a second i think i smelled like the burning electronics smell for a second,but im not sure."
1,low quality,"had this for a year, the wall charger worked when i first got it, but broke on me when i really needed it.Will nolonger charge my ipod and adaptor smells of burning plastic."
3,Apple car charger,This was as described and works pretty good. The retractable cord is nice and keeps from having cords laying around in the car.
1,.37 Cents worth of product,I paid next to nothing for this and recieved an appropriate level of product. Next time I'll pay a little more and get something I can actually use.
5,Good and Inexpensive,"I paid practically nothing for this, and although it seems to be a cheaper construction than the apple brand, it works just fine. It's especially great as an extra travel charger so I can leave my other one at home. I especially appreciate the retractable cable. I wish all my cords were like this."
1,do you like your ipod?,"If the answer is yes, then don't buy this charger. I picked this up because of the price and reviews here on Amazon. On the first use it fried my ipod. I was listening while charging and suddenly the music stopped. The screen went blank and I checked the charger; it was hot and smelled like burning plastic. My ipod, which had worked faithfully for 4+ years, has never worked since. If you like your ipod, DO NOT BUY THIS CHARGER."
3,You get what you pay for,"Overall the cable/charger combo is pretty cheap plastic, but it's dirt cheap and works as advertised."
3,works but worried it wont last,The charger works and it is VERY nice that it coils up the wire for you. The quality of the plastic is poor though and I am skeptical of its durability.
4,great kit,"Easy to use, multi-options for charging your i-products. Product is built to last and will provide you with years of use."
3,Buy it for the price,For the price you can't beat this item. I'm not sure how long it will last kinda cheaply made but again for the price you can't beat it I recommend it. With a little TLC I'm it will last.
3,DC Charger,"This charger is a great value for the money, but the quality seems overly cheap... Not sure how long it will last but, at this price I suppose you could by your own insurance policy with two."
2,this charger sucks,It took over 2 weeks for me to recive it and when I finally got it the car charger didn't worked.
5,iPod USB Charger Kit,This is a great item. It was ideal for my wife's iPod and it is compact and easy to travel with. Quality construction.
1,"Great price - unfortunately, product doesn't work","I thought I was getting a real deal on this. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of leaving the seller a good feedback rating before I'd actually tried the product.It doesn't work. The LED on the AC adapter lights up when you plug it in, but the iPod never charges. It's not worth messing with trying to get a refund for less than three dollars - I'll just avoid doing business with the seller again.Guess there's a reason the official Apple chargers are so expensive - they actually charge the iPod."
5,All 3 Works,"Just got them and all 3 works.The wall adapter is just like any other adapters you can get here on Amazon, but now it's in a bundle!The car charger looks a bit weird to me, but hey, it works.The cable is good being you can retract it and so it won't get tangled when you put it in your backpack or w/e.All 3 seems to be made pretty good, very good value."
1,Whats up with this?,The cord snapped and the plug broke within 2 days and I never used the car charger so that would probably break too.
1,You get what you pay for...,"I bought three of these ipod connector/charger kits a couple of months ago, and while they are somewhat functional, they are as cheaply made as their price would indicate. The USB connector cord is retractable, but the cable is very thin and I have one that is already frayed where it goes into the USB end while the second one I have got stuck in the open position and does not retract any more. The car charger is just as cheap - the first time I went to use it, the end fell apart in the outlet and I had to pry the pieces out with a needlenose pliers. The wall charger is the only piece that I haven't had any trouble with yet.If you're looking for something dirt cheap that's fine, just know that these will only last a few months and are basically disposable."
5,Worth the Price!,"Charger kit was better than I expected! After losing my original iPod USB charger, I went online to find a new one and came across this listing, which included not only the USB cable, but a wall and car charger as well. I've used the wall and USB charger and both are great. At some point, will try the car one. Overall, great price and great product :)"
4,Great for its price,"I've been using this product for several years already and have no complaints. Even though the product looks cheap, it works fine. Great for its price!"
2,Half works with shoddy craftsmanship,"Be warned the wall plug charger works but the car charger does not, it gets power but won't charge an iPod or any other USB device I hooked up to it.So if your looking for a cheap wall charger get this but spend a little more for a decent car charger that doesn't come with a pre-bent USB socket while still in the packaging. I had to bend the USB port with a screwdriver just to plug it in."
2,Not as it seems,"The charger part was not included. Instead, I got the wall plug and two retractable cables. Whatever. It was cheap and not worth arguing over."
5,Works Great!!! Great Buy!!,"I purchased this for my trip to cancun to charge up my ipod at the airports. It worked great and does everything it's suppose to do. The sticker on the usb cable fell off, but that's not a big deal. The price is great. I would highly recommend this for anyone with ipod, iphone, etc."
4,Good,"Pretty nice. Way cheaper than name-brand ones at the store. I just gave it to my friend, in the end. But yeah, I prefer this than spending over $20 for the store ones."
3,Cheap OK for iPod - Does not work for iPad,"Retractable cable is convenient (probably fragile)The iPod connectors has a ""security"" to stay in place (not sure it useful)The overall product quality is low but FAIR for the price paid.Not powerful enough to charge an iPad but works fine with iPods."
3,Not sure if it even works.,"I've had this thing for a few weeks now. I just tried out the wall charger a couple days ago and I couldn't really tell if it was charging or not. The light on the charger came on and everything but, my battery meter didn't seem to move. In comparison with the USB cord I normally charge my iPod Touch with on my laptop, seems to me I should have noticed the battery power go up...a least a little. It seems to be rather cheaply made but it hasn't fallen apart on me yet. Perhaps I didn't leave it plugged in long enough to notice a charge. Haven't tried the DC car charger yet, and from what I've heard about it, I probably never will. For 59 cents, you get what you pay for. If it ends up working out better for me in the future, I will re-post. At least it didn't blow up my iPod."
3,its ok,"its ok for the price that i payed for it, looks very cheap and might break if not careful with it other wise does the job"
3,Not Really Sure,I took it out of the bag and somehow broke the car adapter so I never got to use it. It looks kinda cheesy to me but again I never got to use the product to know if it would even charge my Ipod. I think I will go with something that says Ipod.
3,Great Buy for the Price,"Overall this charger set was a very good buy. A relative paid $20 alone for a more aesthetically pleasing wall adapter. You get a car charger and cable thrown in for a fraction of the price.These are all cheaply made, but function well for the price.I really liked the retractable cord. Unfortunately it stopped working within days of the purchase. I was bummed, but I decided it wasn't worth the hassle of ending it back. I still use the adapters a year-and-a-half later. The USB adapter portion is a little loose internally, but work fine.Despite the defective cable, I would still buy this product in the future if the need comes up."
1,Waste of money,The charger did not work with any of our iPods iPads or iPhones. This was a complete waste of money
2,adapters no workie on iPhone 3GS,"Hey, the retractable cord works with my new iPhone 3GS -- didn't pay attention and discovered that the cord can't be used to charge via USB. Both the cig and wall cahrgers simply produced a screen message informing that the devices weren't compatible.If you order, choose one of the cheap, no shipping options...so you can trash and forget all the return hassles. (quite a biz model, eh?)"
3,Doesn't look good but works!,"It does not have the delicate look that usual Apple proudct would have, but it works. For the price and functionality, I think you should get it. They are making the money for each item the listed price and shipping cost."
2,Bad product,"This multi-way charger seemed like a really awesome device from the get go: 3 in 1, really cheap, etc. However, it's also really cheaply made. The car charger part was really the only part I used and within two months, it got STUCK in my cigarette lighter!! I tried to pry the life out of it, with no luck. It's now stuck in there and now I can't plug anything else in it, other chargers, GPS, etc. I highly do NOT recommend this to anyone."
1,Seems like a crap shoot,"Judging from other reviews, you may get a set that works. Mine did not. The USB cord doesn't work, the car charger is not recognized by my ipod, and the wall charger kept falling out of the wall.When you spend less than $[...], returning the item is more work than it's worth. Just know that the item you get may or may not work. When orderding off of the internet for convenience, I like to know that I have better odds of getting what I need to work the first time."
5,Great buy for the money,"I looked at similar items in the large retail stores before purchasing and found them much more expensive for the same product. Packaging was old and falling apart, but product arrived in fine shape and works well."
2,What You Pay For,"Only the wall charger works for me. The retractable USB cable doesn't connect to my 3rd gen. I was sent a replacement cable and it doesn't work either. The LED on the car charger lights up, but it doesn't charge the device. So, basically you're paying a few bucks for a wall charger, which is pretty handy. Even better, it's dual voltage; so if you're abroad, you can charge it without hassle.Overall, it's worth buying if you know that you're only getting a wall charger."
1,do not order from this company,"Ordered the universal apple ipod back in April. This charger was defected and cause my Ipod and my daughters boyfriend IPod to burn up. After trying to contacted seller several times he credited the shipping for this item, never made an effort to make good on the 2 products that were destroyed. Warning stay away from any device that can ruin your phone ordering this was about a $700.00 mistake still waiting to hear from dealer but I guess he feels he made good by crediting the four dollars that was spent. Rating was one star only because I had to give it something. Warning stay away from Importer 520"
4,"Hapless girl, not heartless","Do you ever feel that no matter what you do it turns out wrong? Did you make a big mistake years ago, and it still haunts you? Do your good intentions just make a bigger mess? Well join the crowd in this book. Noreen Stall is 17 years old, and a veritable Tasmanian Devil of disaster. Misfortune and accidents flash off her like a 4th of July sparkler. Arriving in the small town of Pembina Lake marks a turning point in her life. The people there recognize themselves in her, and remember their youthful misjudgments. In trying to help Noreen, and set her on the right path, they start to heal their own pain. And when Noreen decides to stop running away, she discovers pride and satisfaction in making reparations. This time, her spark kindles hope. A little gem of a book for young adults."
2,too superficial,It didnt appeal to me. Did the orchestra have a bad day. I have heard much better versions that brought me more joy and gave the symphony more credit Sorry
3,"Great Recording, My Tastes Have Changed","When I was in college, back in the pre-Cambrian epoch, I loved this symphony. Used to listen to it on headphones (not earbuds!). Anyway, this is a lovely recording, but the symphony no longer speaks to me the way it once did. Tastes change of course, but now the musical themes seem almost self-parodying. Not the recording's fault, of course."
4,Inspiring Movie,"In these difficult times a thoughtful movie with an inspirational message is more than welcome. PJ delivers on both fronts. Howard Nash and John Heard's characters are both in search of solace and solutions and in the setting of a mental facility both struggle to find their individual paths. John Heard portrayal of Dr Shearson is a well crafted and believable performance. Howard Nash's PJ is a conflicted portrayal of man searching for meaning. Patrica Ray is masterful as ""PJ's"" girl friend. Vincent Pastore adds a comical spin and lightness to the darker portions of the movie. Neal Argo's music ties the elements of the film with a superb musical talent. Finally, Russ Emanuel's direction brings it all together with a fine touch for young director with great promise."
1,Made in China,"Although my dog was very attracted to this toy, I chose to stop purchasing the replacement disks once I realized they were made in China. I just don't trust the quality of the product."
2,Too easy,"This toy provided very little mental stimulation to my dog. The treat is so exposed and extremely easy to eat off, and the bone so hard and ball so heavy he wanted nothing to do with it after the treat was gone. We have a heavy chewer, but unless you have a small dog with a small light bite that takes time eating it, I just can't imagine it would be worth the price of buying their own hides to attach. I would suggest a nylabone first to make sure your dog is interested in chewing on the bone part even when there isn't treats attached."
2,"My Samoyed only interested on the treats, and not on the bouncy bone","Once the inserted jerky treats have gone, my 11 month Samoyed soon left the bone alone and never touching it again. I'm confused now. I have bought plenty variations of dog toys, either nothing lasts quite long, or my dog just doesnt like the toy."
5,Good choice!,"My dog likes the medium-sized bone and treats. And, I like it since it keeps him occupied longer than the small one."
2,Not for my dog,"Purchased this because of all of the great reviews, but this just isn't for my dog. I have a pit bull who is an enthusiastic power chewer. On its own, she wasn't really interested in it. I put a bit of peanut butter between the gnawhide discs and the rubber ball and she finally got it. It took her a good 20 - 30 minutes to get both of the treats off, after which she started chewing on the hard plastic bone ends. Unfortunately, she started gnawing little chunks off of the ends - besides the little pieces of plastic that were coming off, the chewing also peppered the texture of the hard white plastic with sharp little pieces that were cutting the inside of her mouth and gums - there was blood all over the ends of the toy. I had to take it away from her, because, while she likes the toy, she's also destroying her mouth with it."
2,not long lasting,The small is really really small. I purchased this with two refill packs. I have a miniature schnouzer and he never destroys things. This product is not durable and I put it up each time each time he has finised the treat so it will last longer. The two packages of treats I purchased are nearly gone and this will hit the trash soon after.
3,Mis-leading,This case is ok. It has a nice stand but the picture shows a clear stand inside thee case for the football to sit on. The real case comes with two circles on the sides of the case for the ends of the football to sit in. The football does not sit tightly and has room to shift. I felt mislead by the picture.
1,Too hard to use,"I was really looking forward to enjoying the features of this watch. Unfortunately, I bought it before checking elsewhere online for reviews. It is nearly impossible to set. Don't buy it."
1,piece of junk,I received this piece of junk after waiting about two weeks it was stated to be a like new copy but it was purchased from Goodwill and I had several rips and tears and a very poor cover was very dissatisfied
5,Among the Imposters,Among the ImpostersThis book about a kid named Luke that is a third child and third children are illegal. If the police find him he will be tortured to death. In this book he just got a fake id and his new name is Lee. Then he has to go to +- School for Boys and he gets in trouble because he doesn't know how to act like a baron. Barons are the rich people. In the end he starts helping other third children.Luke's appearance in this book is a lot like what a rich person would look like with fancy clothes. His personality is nice and helpful to other children.I liked the book because I have read all the books in the series and I just like the plot. Also I like it because of how he get in trouble and how he almost gets caught not being a baron.
2,Where's the clinical photos,"I bought this book because it was suggested by our program. After a couple months into the derm residency I wish I would have bought Mckee's dermpath book. Much easier to read, and has plenty of both histo and clinical photos. If you need help sleeping, forget the ambien, this will do the trick."
4,Winter of the Wolf Moon,"If you like books that are written with the same character (s) and are good, fun stories, then you will love these books.Thus far there are 8. The first was reccommended to me and since then I have decided to read all 8. Very good stuff."
3,About as Mediocre As The First Book...,"Alex McKnight is no longer a PI but he decides to help a mysterious woman. That decision leads Alex into more trouble with the wrong people. The upper peninsula of Michigan gets as much trouble as cold and snow in this second book of the series.I think Steve Hamilton books are too short and rushed. He reaches only 320 pages in this one and I just didn't feel he developed the plot and characters enough to impress me. Also, I am not a fan of this book being written in first person because it has me walking too much in Alex's shoes and I still have found myself empathetic with the character yet.I have not been impressed with the first two books but know others who like this author alot. I plan to continue the series with optimism that future reviews will be better. This book was not terrible but it was not impressive either."
3,Liked it about as well as the first one.,"I liked this book pretty well. At least well enough to give another book of his a try sometime in the future. I like his writing style overall. I seldom read first person narratives, but he writes in a way that I forget this is first person. I found some of his ploys a little unreal. I am about the same age as the main character and if I was dragged behind a snowmobile and hospitalized I certainly would not go running off to confront a huge hoodlum in a bar the next day or two.The Molinov letting him go ploy was silly beyond belief but it is a ploy used by a lot of writers in this genre and on the movies. Believe me, if you or I are in the position where we see a drug lord kill three people, you can bet that we are going to be next. He isn't going to let us go because he thinks we might have something in common and could be useful down the road.But other than that I found the book enjoyable."
2,McKnight is an idiot,"...Alex McKnight (boy, a clever name) comes across as a complete idiot. Let's see - drive up to your remote cabin and see the door open, so just mosey on in. I mean, it's not like he has any reason to suspect anything's wrong.The guy who tried to kill you has been spotted in Canada? Well, since you're just out of the hospital with a collapsed lung, why not drive on up there for a showdown? To be really clever, let your moron partner give you zero information before you go in for the confrontation.And then ultimately, the plot in these McKnight books is so obvious, material for one book is stretched over three, McKnight bumbles around and then has a gestalt in the last few pages and everthing is so formulaic. Gee, I wonder if Alex and police chief Maven (hey, another clever name) will end up with a grudging respect for each other? I'll never find out, though, because after reading two of these awful books I, unlike Alex, won't be bumbling back for more."
3,white powder on the reservation,excellent sense of place-upper peninsula of michigan. engaging cast of small town characters. tone is that of an outdoor men's club. comic interplay of p.i. partners. main character has a nearly insuffrable tolerance for pain.
3,"Good story, but a lot of typos","It's amazing to me. The publisher charges twice as much for the kindle version than the price of the mass paperback version. Which doesn't make sense as the paperback uses trees(paper) and has to be shipped and distributed to book stores, where the kindle version saves both of those costs. But to add insult to injury, there are an unusual number of typos in the book. ""I said"" instead of ""he said"", etc. Kinda makes a story hard to follow. You would think if the publisher is going to charge a premium for the kindle version, they would a least make an attempt to provide a good product.Otherwise it is a good story, as you would expect from this author. Hard to put down! The author get fives stars, the publisher gets one star."
2,not a good phone,"this phone has anoying beeping sound, changing chanels doesn't help, answering machine is so so , doesn't sound digital to me,every time you have a new message machine plays everything from the begining so if you have a old message machine will play this first then your new message.What they were thinking i don't know, why would you want to listin your old messages.Motorola has to impprove this feature .The handset is very uncomfortble against my ear,feels like pice of wood, after 20 min conversation my ear was hurtung me, volume for both ringer and handset way to low,overrall not a good phone, thumbs down to motorola, very weak product.Don't buy this phone it's a waste of your money and time."
1,Poor quality,"This phone has the worst sound quality. I've never had a phone sound this bad. The static is almost unbearable and changing the channels doesn't do any good. Also, the life of the battery is poor. I thought since my cell was motorola and it's great that this one would be too, boy was I wrong. Never! Never! Again! will I buy a cordless phone made by motorola."
2,This phone is not good for a Motorola,"I really dislike this phone!! We bought it becasue it was a Motorola and figured that would assure us a higher quality - wrong!! It cuts out a lot of the time, the caller ID function has a lot of quirks compared to other phones I have used. The phone also sounds ""tinny"" a lot of the time. Everyone who comes over and uses it, comments on its bad sound quality. I would NOT recomend. WE are currently searching for a new one."
3,"Good phone, bad antenna and cheap paint!","I purchased this phone knowing of Motorola's reputation, but after only two months the antenna broke at the base. I glued it back on until I can buy another phone, but not this one! The sound quality is great as are the features, but along with the cheap antenna the paint on the back of the phone where it touches the charger will start to wear off."
3,"happy? maybe yes, maybe no...","Great phone w/ a lot of features. Battery lasts long enough. Sound quality excellent. BUT: I come home every day and find 6, 7, or even 8 messages in the answering machine w/ no one talking. now, this never happened to me w/ my previous one. Certainly the manual doesn't help me w/ my problem. If someone could, please leave a review, and if not, that's something you will want to think about..."
1,"I wish there was a ""0 Star"" option","This is the worst phone ever! I have *never* had a call with clear reception, and the answering machine only picks up when it feels like it. I wish I had kept my reciept, but instead of going back to Motorola, this phone is going in the garbage."
2,Don't bother!,"I bought this phone about a year ago as it was the right price for what I wanted. The sound has never been good (lots of static) and has got worse over the year. It is now totally broken, I cannot dial out and there is no ring when calling in. Very dissapointing, I thought Motorola would be a safe bet, but I won't be buying this brand again."
1,This is the worst phone out there!,"This phone does not even deserve one star. The answering machine will sometimes play one of my messages that a friend or family member left as my ""hello I am not here"" message! Sometimes I don't get any messages at all...it will skip them all together and play them later. Also, the battery died after one year. It is just bad. Don't buy it."
4,Pretty Good Phone,"I'm rrrreeeaaallllyyyy glad that I didn't listen to all the bad reviews that people have given to this phone. As soon as it was delivered to my door, the phone has been great. The Caller ID takes a little long to pick up, but I've dealt with worse. The ring is great because it's not too loud, but not too soft. I've got 2 little ones at home and when they are taking their naps, the phone use to wake them up . . . not anymore!! The battery on it is great compared to the last VTech phone that I had. The answering machine is a little annoying because I have to listen to ""Message 1"" then ""Message 1 erased"", but I can get over that. Oveall, I'm glad I paid the money on the phone and it was completely worth it."
2,Dissapointed Italian speaking parent,"This book was very dissapointing. The English phrases and illustrations are very creative. However, the translation into Italian is very poor. It is full of errors that one might not notice if he or she did not already speak Italian well. The idea of the book is a great one. It is really too bad that the translation is of such poor quality. I hope Berlitz publishes a second corrected edition."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PLAYER!,"I placed an order for a ""new"" Samsung DVD-HD841 player. What I received was a used/Remanufactured Samsung DVD-HD841. The box containing the unit was very worn. When I opened the box the dvd player was not wrapped by Samsung and there was no instruction Manual. When I hooked the player up to my TV only 2 of the 3 component video inputs worked. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PLAYER. I returned the HD841 (Amazon charged me to return the player!) and purchased the HD941,it works great! BUT! I wish Amazon would ship the players in a second box and not just slap a lable on the box it comes in, UPS doen not handle with care!"
1,Component Colors Dead,"On arrival, this thing only put out red signals. Only has a DVI output, not HDMI. BUYER BEWARE!"
3,DVI not all it's cracked up to be,"Don't buy this player just because of the DVI. When you use the DVI, the Samsung doesn't render all gradations of black. You can clearly see this in the THX contrast test or by noting how dark the interiors are on the first few minutes of Star Wars Episode IV. Sound & Vision magazine noted it too (January issue). It's a critical flaw, very noticeable, and for me renders DVI unwatchable. That said, the component video output delivers a good picture and I'm happy with the sound, but don't be like me and buy this player because you wanted to check out DVI."
1,it didnt work so i had to send it back,"i received this item quickly but it did not work, the one output from the component outs was not working causing a tint to the picture. also the sound outputs were not working correctly causing a hissing noise. all in all, this item said it was remanufactured but it didnt seem like it was even tested. i was very dissapointed."
3,upconverting,"I just pulled this out of storage to use as a an analog cd player for a new(for me) vintage marantz receiver that arrived today, I see a lot of complaints about the up converting abilities of this unit but as I recall when I used it last it only upconverted if using a dvi cable and as I recall this was not pointed out very clearly in the instuctions once I changed cables it was almost as good as the hd I was getting from comcast cable but I would say 75 percent better then 480"
4,Nostalgia!,"This is almost like the cookbook that I started with, more than fifty years ago! The only significant difference is with the spiral binding, which now is anchored in cardboard and might not hold up quite as well as the original. I considered getting copies for each of the grandchildren, but it turns out too much has changed in the kitchen. Still, if you ever had this cookbook, it's fun to muse on the fun recipes (candle salad?) and share your memories with kids who have been using microwave ovens since they could reach the counter."
5,Best Cookbook from my childhood,"My brother and I had the spiral bound book from when my parents were young. While now over time the pages are aging, not only did it hold up well, but it gave my brother and I some of the best memories from when we were younger. From making cinnamon french toast to bird's nest , cakes, cookies and beyond, every Sunday morning we would get up early and rush to the closet to decide what we would make next for breakfast. Not only do I highly recommend this book, but I think that after anyone sees it they will too. Sure it's great for the kids anywhere between the ages of 5 and up (maybe a little younger) but, even as we got older, my brother and eye still leafed through the pages to remember how to make some of our favorite recipes.Believe me, after working in the world's largest Border's for over a year, I can tell after leafing through most cookbooks for kids and adults alike, I believe this book is one of the most fantastic buys you can get."
2,Poor warranty,Did another review for this company on another piece of AV equipment outlining the month long effort to get a hard copy of the warranty sent to me. Finally received it after many phone calls/emails to Amazon and company. Amazon should drop this bunch if they want credibility. I have EXTREME doubts that this company would honor any repair work if necessary based on their pathetic follow up and horrible customer service. DON'T BUY THIS EXTENDED WARRANTY.
4,Great customer service,"I've used the warranty service almost 4 years after I bought the TV. The warranty is actually 3 years because it starts from the day you purchase the item. When I called NEW for the service they appointed a really great contractor that came out to check out what was wrong with the TV. The tech stated that the DMD chip needed to be replaced along with the lamp as the TV is rear projection DLP. The tech said that they might not replace the lamp as in the contract it states that it's a ""consumable"" item and not covered by the warranty. I called the NEW place and asked if they could replace the lamp. The agent on the phone stated that she will escalate the case to research to see if the lamp can be replaced. After several days I got a call from NEW stating that both parts were approved for replacement. Two days later the tech showed up and replaced them. The TV picture quality is like brand new."
1,warranty problem,when i purchased this plan it was for a tv between $1000 and 1499.99.new contract claims that my purchase had to be under $1000 so they will NOT honor it. this means i do not have an extended warranty.i either want this warranty for the price that was agreed upon or a full refund.i'm happy i found out about this problem before i needed the warranty.
3,Disappointing!,"Coverage limited primarily to certain ""clasic"" senior models, ignoring the vast majority of both pre- and post-war models. Beautiful photographs make the book one for the coffee table."
5,Wonderful!,"I couldn't believe the wonderful, pure sounds that came from this low-priced CD. I absolutely love it and highly recommend it!!"
1,Bad,This the worst CD I've ever had...terrible doesn't begin to describe it. There was nothing even remotely enjoyable..soothing to the ear would NOT be a description that I would give it.
4,An entertaining and sometimes enlightening look at ethics,This book is basically a collection of excerpt from Mr. Cohen's New York times ethics columns. The book is organized into various ethical situations from workplace situations to riding public transportation. Many of the questions asked are illuminating simply based on the choices they bring to mind; the author's irrepressible wit makes the book a completely entertaining package. The short sections make it ideal material for both the bathroom or a few minutes of quick nighttime reading. Just be careful you don't start a great moral debate with your spouse right before bedtime!
3,Didn't last to long,"The mickey-mouse phone was nice while it lasted, after a while it stopped working, the phone doesn't turn on anymore and sometimes it doesnt ring. i thought that it was the battery so i replaced it but that didnt work i replaced it twice thinking it was the wrong one that i bought the first time but nothing its still down so its cute and the ring tone are addorable but its just for show and tell now thats it. SORRY TO SAY BUT ITS NOT WORTH THE $60.00 THAT I PAID FOR IT."
3,Loses its Charm Quickly,"I bought this phone almost two years ago and, let me tell you, it loses its charm FAST. The different Disney song ring tones that are at first cute, quickly become annoying and there really isn't a ""standard"" ring tone to enable. Further, the phone has several major drawbacks:1- You can't cradle it between ear and neck and go ""hands-free"" while doing dishes or folding laundry because the adorable Mickey shaped on/off button is at just the right spot to hang up on you every time.2- There is a ring delay/disconnect delay. So, when my house phones are all ringing, this phone is behind. By the time Mickey starts singing, the answering machine downstairs has picked up.3- The phone doesn't keep a charge and has to be in the base after almost every call.4- This is my second phone; the first caught fire when I plugged it in for the initial charge and had to be exchanged.Overall- cute concept but definitely needs some design revisions."
