2,Not in Star Wars Anymore,"Normally I don't write a review to any book I read, but I feel I must express my outrage for what the authors are doing to the Star Wars story. First they kill off Chewie, which in itself is an outrage, but I continued to read the series feeling that it would have to redeem itself in some way. However, to the contrary, it has progressively gotten worse. ...Then to have Jaina struggling with the dark side, ridiculous. The plot in this book was small and not very well written. The only redeeming point for this book is the further knowledge of the YV technology. This is my last NJO book. I have no further interest in seeing how the next ...[book] will decide to destroy the real SW saga."
2,"Flat, not a lot of depth","I like Jaina Solo, and I have an interest in what a person thinks and feels as they walk that line between dark side and light, I thought this book would catch my interest, but sadly it didn't. This is one of the few books I have had to force myself to finish.There is a great story in this book, a story that could have been told better. The plot is great, but the author's portrayal of it falls flat in may ways; characters are lacking depth, scenes are skimpy on details, and there was no emotional envolvement for the reader.There is a scene in this book that should have been deep, and moving and powerful, and perhaps dwelled upon a little longer, it was a funeral for crying out loud! Yet like most events in the book, it is skimmed briefly, and then passed by.This author has written some great short stories and novellas, and that is what this book felt like, a short story or novella stretched out to fill the 300 pages of a novel."
4,There's no way out!,"Talk about addicting! Ever since I bought the first installment of the New Jedi Order I just have to know how the story continues. And boy does it! For better and for worse. So far this episode is not one of my favorites so far but again...it's well written, true to the series and very exciting."
3,The Extinction Club,"The legendary deer known as the Milu, was thought to be extinct until a Basque missionary, Pere David stumbled upon them in the Chinese emperor's private park in the second half of the 19th century. Pere David smuggled a specimen to Europe igniting in the process, a clamour among several European nations to acquire a live animal. Eventually the Boxer rebellion led to the deer's extirpation from China but a herd survived in England on the private estate of the 11th Duke of Bedford. Robert Twigger's tale is a mix of whimsical, sometimes cheeky romps through history, and modern day divergences into the meaning of truth, myths and evolution."
5,The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys,"I enjoyed this book very much. I've now made it one of my favorites. It was hilarious and tragic all in one. I laughed out loud several times, which I do not do when reading. The language used, in dialog especially, captures the true voice of being Southern. I should know, I'm a life long Southerner. I could feel the desperation of being bored in the South, maybe because I know about it personally. It made me long for junior high school again. It is sad this is and will be Fuhrman's only book. He would have been the next great Southern write, the modern Faulkner. Loved it. Read it. Savor it. Enjoy it."
5,FUN!!!,yet another great song from another fun band that will never be as big in the usa as they are in europe.unfortunatly.....this song is as addictive as a drug--from the first listen you are hooked.this stong stays in your head and gets you dancing. every remix here is hot. who else can sample diana ross and phil collins in the same song?
1,I'm still waiting for my humidifier,I put this order last week and nothing yet. Also I cannot canceled because is being procesed.Mi son needs this humidifier as soon as possible.
2,not worth money,Well we had to buy another and our first cow from crane still works to this day to which we bought a few years back. this one however even though i bought it in 2010 and im just not getting to review it we had problems when it first arrived. the sound was so loud it made our child stay awake. we even tried putting a soft towel underneath it. then for the past year off and on the motor started breaking. now the motor is just so loud and smells when we turn it on. not good!
1,Lots of MOLD,"This will add humidity to your room, but I need to wash it every 2 weeks as mold grows within the unit. I wash with a vinegar solution (manufaturer recommended). It takes me about 45 minutes to clean the unit as all the corners and tight spaces cause me to use Q-tips and other small crevice tools. It is very annoying and the mold is back within 2 weeks time. I will be looking for another unit as this one is so dissapointing."
4,Climbing Daddy Mountain,I would use this book with 2-3year olds and preschoolers. This book is about a little girl who takes on the adventure of climbing up her daddy to sit on top of his shoulders. I think that many children would be able to relate to the adventure of climbing to the top of their loved one's shoulders. The pictures are simple. The little girl is draw with pencil and looks like she is colored with colored pencils. Daddy Mountain is a shaded picture of a man. The author/illustrator does a great job showing the struggles the little girl faces on the way to the top with the expression on her face. I think that Jules Feiffer did a great job showing the height of Daddy Mountain with the colored fold out page and the picture of the little girl looking down at her mother. Great book that I plan on reading to my niece that climbs into my arms everytime she sees me.
1,No sense,"I agree with mom from NoCal. This book is not written for children. My 7 year old, who reads on a 3rd grade level struggled with the line ""I have to be careful and go not too fast."" I'm a graduate writing student and I had to read it a few times for it to make sense. There should be a comma or ""not too fast"" should have been made its own sentence (yeah, yeah I know it's a fragment, but at least it would make it more understandable.) I think Mr. Feiffer or one of his colleagues at Southampton College wrote the first review. The illustrations are not interesting enough to keep the attention of my 3 year old and the story bores my 7 year old. Oh well, just another book to sell on Amazon."
2,Rent it,"I was impressed with The Storm Riders and thought A Man Called Hero will be equally good. But i was wrong. No doubt it has some good special effects, it emphasied too much on the story until it is very slow and boring. In additon to that, certain effects parts are a bit fake. Overall, quite a boring show."
2,disappointing and over-rated or atleast the dubbed version,"I've only seen the dubbed version, but the fighting was lame and bland. Ekin Cheng is an OK actor. His lacks grace, power, or beauty in his movements. I am a huge HK martial arts movie fan and have been watching this stuff since I was in kindergarten. There are far better movies out there. The special effects are lame, even for time period. The statue of liberty shots were pixelated and the action totally unspired. Any Lau has made some good movies in the past, but this one isn't one. If you feel mindless and just want to watch something, it might be half way entertaining."
4,"Great Special Effects, highlight this movie","Having seen the Storm Riders, I was in high-anticipation of viewing this film. CGI/computer-generated special effects are now prevalent in films from all over. Are the effects enough to justify the purchase of this film?Beyond the effects, there is a descent main plot. However, the film suffers from sub-plots that end too suddenly. In addition, the main story ends, to be continued in a sequel. While this is not surprising, I felt that the movie ended abruptly. It may sound confusing, but if you watch ""A Man Called Hero"", you'll understand.With the growing popularity of CGI, I hope that moviemakers will still maintain some credible fight choreagraphy within the sequence. Luckily, this movie has some of the most eye-opening effects reminiscent of ""The Matrix"".Definitely worth a view, and I would recommend a purchase."
4,Malcolm X Soundtrack is Solid but Lacks One Powerful Song,"Indeed, the soundtrack from the motion picture Malcolm X achieves its goal in capturing the music of the great Muslim leader's childhood and adult years. But lacking from the soundtrack is Sam Cooke's beautifully orchestrated song ""A Change is Gonna Come,"" an inspirational civil rights anthem that is featured near the end of director Spike Lee's masterpiece but for some reason is not on the CD. This soundtrack would surely be worthy of a five-star rating if it weren't for this glaring omission."
3,Atypical soundtrack,"Most movie soundtrack albums include incidental orchestral music, while some have excerpts of actual film dialog. The soundtrack to MALCOLM X has none of this. The set opens with an Arrested Development political piece written especially for the film, then follows a logical musical and stylistic progression from the early 40s (swing), right through to the year of Malcolm's murder, 1965 (soul), and finally closes out with an overlong gospelish Aretha Franklin track.The MALCOLM X soundtrack was given an average rating because its bookends (particularly the opening number) ill-fit the majority of the program-- just as Spike Lee's epilogue politicking (with young children declaring themselves to be Malcolm X) adds little to a well-told story.TOTAL TIME: 49:59"
2,Not the Barkley I hoped for...,"I love Charles Barkley; his insight and wit on TV are terrific. I had hoped that I would get to read even more of his thoughts on the world today by buying this book, but I was disappointed. If you like reading mainly about his basketball career and not much else, then you'll like this book. I enjoyed reading some of it, but was hoping to read something more ""deep"" from Charles."
2,Disappointing to say the least.......,"I agree with most of the other reviewers in the fact that Charles repeats himself over and over and over until you want to scream: ""I got it, racism is bad!!"" It's almost as though Charles and Michael Wilbon (who I think is a fantastic journalist) struggle to make this book longer that a Sports Illustrated feature article. Simply put, the book is terrible in every aspect......thank God it was so short!!"
1,"Bad book, no doubt","What a waist to buy and read this book. In three pages Barkley could have made his points, but instead he keeps repeating himself all the time. Great player, bad writer. He should have sticked with writing about basketball and not about how great an opinionleader he thinks he is. No doubt it's wrong to buy this book."
3,A bit disappointing,"I have been a Barkley fan for years, but this book is just a bunch of ramblings on by him. I felt like I was listening to him come up with ideas off of the top of his head rather than a printed book that went through edits and revisions. I would have like to have seen his thoughts organized better and edited so it read well. If you are looking for your standard Barkley matter-of-fact, cut-to-the-heart rantings, it is in there. But because it is so poorly written, I didn't even finish the book. I got tired of the reiterations and mindless (and sometimes unrelated) babbling."
4,Good for its purpose,"Purchased this book as a gift for my friend whose son was having his tonsils removed. It's good for what it is. Definitely helped my friends son, and that's what matters."
2,Too Long.,"I purchased this book prior to my 3 year old son having his tonsils removed and tubes put in.While It's a great idea and concept -- the book was just too long. It didn't hold his attention for more than 5 pages. My son is a reader, like me, and any other book we've read, he's been very in to...just not this one.I don't recommend it for anyone under the age of, say....8."
3,Only two really good songs (2.7 stars),"I'm afraid there are only two real good songs on that anthology:Biggest part of you and You're the only woman. A few others, like ""Nice,nice, very nice"" or ""holdin on to yesterday"", are decent but not outstanding. That is pretty meager for a best of compilation. Advice: Get the giants of melodious vocal rock first:Beatles (of course), Moody Blues, Supertramp, Cockney Rebel, Queen, Barclay James Harvest (the Live album); on the more progressive side: Genesis, Vanilla Fudge,Gentle Giant, Yes,"
5,This book captivated me!,"What a beautiful story! It took me over a week to get through the first 50 pages. It was slow to start, but once it did, it took off. I read the rest of the book in just a few days, and was enthralled every step of the way. The characters were real, complex, and sympathetic. The twists and turns involved in the second half really held my interest. The story just broke my heart. It touches on so many things, each in a tender way that will strike a chord, I believe, with most women. I am not as sure that this book would be quite as meaningful to men, but perhaps I am wrong. Of the four books written about China that I have read in the last year, this is definitely my favorite. The descriptions of footbinding will stick with me for a long time. Pick this one up for sure!! You will not regret it!"
3,Book,"The book is in good condition, however, the seller took longer than expected to send the book. I missed the opportunity to read the book on vacation due to its late arrival."
4,You speak to me as a chinese. Thank you for your wonderfuly tale of a golden friendship.,"I truely appreciate your hard work on understanding the Chinese culture whom a lot of American born Chinese or Chinese in Hong Kong were not willing to be educated to know their cultrual root and be proud of the Chinese history. Through the 'laotong' realtionship between Snow Flower and Lily, you have demonstarted that regardless of time and place, we stood as one person to another, one woman to another. It's a universal theme for a person in search of love, friendship and one's identity. Thank you for writing and giving the Chinese a voice in the fabric of our America culture."
3,Depressing,"This book was depressing to say the least. It took me about a month to read it, and that is simply because I could not get engrossed. I quickly lost interest and it was like dragging my feet through the sand. If you are looking for a book that makes you think, ""Man, her life sucks."" then this is the book for you."
4,"Ok, imaginative","This was a fast-read for me, in between long, heavy non-fiction. The book was ""visually"" written, intriguing, and a chance to learn more about another culture."
4,Lovley story of deep friendship,"A very indepth, well researched portrayal of life, traditions and superstitions of 19th century rural China, but even more so of the love and heartbreak loving someone unconditionally can bring."
4,A complicated story about friendship and forgiveness,"I finished reading ""Snow Flower and the Secret Fan"" about a week ago, and the story still haunts me. Although we're shown the ugliness of foot-binding and the other horrendous challenges of being a woman living in China during the 1800s, this book serves to illustrate the very complicated relationships between women. When I finished ""Snow Flower..."", I had to wonder what was worse: the torture of being a child enduring the painful foot-binding transition to womanhood or the agony of ""one who has not yet died"" and a lonely existence haunted by regret and shame."
4,A Soothing Tale,"I titled this review as 'soothing' because its one of those warm cozy novels that you read on a snow day...or at least thats what it reminded me of. A nice story but I only gave it 4 stars because I feel it lacked some sort of 'moving' aspect. Definatly one of the better books I've read however nothing that brought tears to my eyes or made me 'feel'. I would recommend reading it, just don't expect as much as I did after reading all the reviews!"
5,One of the best books I've read,A beautifully written book about women's friendships. I recommend this book to every woman I know.
5,Great book!,This is one of my favorite books of all time!!! Also I've read most of Lisa See's books and this is my favorite of hers (but most of them are great too!)
5,Achingly beautiful,"I can hardly remember when a book has touched me as deeply as 'Snow Flower and the Secret Fan'. I finished the book with tears in my eyes.Lisa See wrote a remarkable book about China, about friendship, about 'nu-shu' (a writing system exclusively used among women), about the world of women (talk about bound feet) that revolved around the 'inner room' while man lived in the 'outer room' and about life.This book is a keeper."
5,Familiar,"This book is similar to several other books in that it goes through the life of a traditional Chinese family life and the difficult role of a women in the older Chinese society. The novel aspect is that the story is conveyed via Nushu, which is a secret style of writing only known to women of that region of China, which is historically accurate. Lots of tragic moments, and some surprisingly tender moments between two sworn sisters."
5,How beautifully and skillfully written!,"I was lost in the wonderful magic of See's storytelling ability. There was no emotion left unfathomed and I haven't cried when reading a book in a long time.You cannot help but feel you are in the world of Lily and Snow Flower. I did not want it to end but when it did, the prose still sang in my mind and in my heart.This novel both nourishes the soul and instructs the mind and the lessons learned will not be easily forgotten.Truly enjoyable reading."
5,fantastic story,"I loved this book - I am a fan of novels that weave historical information, or cultural information thru the story, and See did a fantastic job with both. The characters were so well done and the imagery was fantastic. I only wish it was longer!"
5,10 Stars,This story is not like any other. Have been reading non-stop for two days. Lily and Snow Flower....you will fall in love with them.
4,great story,"Books about Oriental women always fascinate me -- especially when they are as well written as this one. Perhaps it is the great difference in culture that pulls you into books like this one or perhaps it is the ease in which you can relate to the suffering and abuse of women in other cultures and times. For whatever reason, women have always gained strength from their friendships and shared experiences and the story of these two friends from very different backgrounds who bond with each other's shared suffering is touching and at the same time entertaining."
4,Great Service,I received my order in a timely matter. I wasn't wondering when my book was coming in. I received it right on time. I will purchace from them again!!
4,Lovely,This is a lovely book. I highly recommend it-- I think that women will enjoy it more then men as it is the story of a special friendship between two women.
3,Book Club picked it,"Had to read this for my book club, we meet next week. Interested in seeing what the others think. I think the book was ok, the writing was ok, and the plot had enough to keep me interested for ONLY the 250 some pages. Glad it was wrapped up in the end. I don't care about the factual accuracy, it is just a story with some facts from history. The foot binding is barbaric and sickening. I am always interested in why people act the way they do in extreme circumstances. How the characters were developed, with a clear switch in what you think about them, was a interesting twist. If you read fast and get from library, not as bad as the one or two star reviews."
5,Loved it,"Lisa See is one of my favorite authors. This book is full of surprise twists and turns. Along with being a great story teller, I think Lisa See, puts a lot of information in her books about Chinese customs, and history. I highly recommend this novel"
2,A bit too charming for my taste,"For me, the risk of writing historical fiction is whether the author will capture the world they describe or whether they will objectify it. My trouble with this book comes down to the feeling it left me with, as though everything from nu-shu to foot binding was a clever tradition to be exploited and exoticized. There seems to be a distance between author and subject matter wherein she doesn't so much capture the past as look at it through rosy glasses. It's not to say that everything in the book is happy and light, but the overall effect feels dispassionate and, dare I say, silly.Clearly this book is appealling to a lot of people, but it didn't capture me. It didn't feel urgent and honest enough, and I never really believed in its characters, their voices or actions. I wanted this to leap off the page, but the words just hung there, pretty and lifeless, charming but uninspired, far too easy to forget or (worse yet) put down."
1,Give this book to your worst enemy trying to learn c,"This is the worst book on c I have ever read. It is used as a text book and that is a travesty. This book has no logical organization in terms of the aspiring c programmer.... it may have some other organization scheme..... but that dosen't matter. How does a book this bad get published? Save your money, and look elsewhere for education on c."
1,Do not use this book!,"I am a professional C/C++ programmer (for about 10 years) and I encountered this book as the text book my wife is using to teach C at a local university. The book is annoying at best, it introduces topics in a counter intuitive order, and simply wrong at worst."
3,Multiple function timer,"This is both a clock and a timer. I purchased this because of the key pad allowing you to enter the minutes in numbers rather than by holding down the minute hand and counting up, which gets a little cumbersome when you want 45 minutes!It does work for that, but the keys are pretty small and therefore a little tough to enter. Also, when the time elapses, the original time setting is lost, so you need to re-enter it each time, for example, when baking multiple sheets of cookies.Overall, I am satisfied, but don't love it."
4,fast seting,"I bought this because it is such a nusiance to hit a 'minute' button 55 times--my most frequently used setting: the campground dryer finishes in 55 minutes. With the numeric keys, setting this one is a breeze.The one improvement I'd like is a 10-minute warning buzz and a 5-minute warning buzz."
4,Interesting Title and Graphic,"I bought copies of this book to give to an inner city school in Philadelphia, through the Alumni Association of Temple University (at the suggestion of their College of Education). I have not read it, but I was interested in it because of the title and cover graphic that seems to break the stereotypical activity choices for children in today's society. The story line seems to entwine a little boy's love for baseball and for his violin. I hope it is a good seller and that more school libraries include this book."
1,Sets a new standard for AWFUL,We have had this answering machine for about 3 months now. We will not have it for a 4th! The recorded message playback is bad and the playback of recorded messages is extremely noisy and garbled. It usually takes 2 or 3 times listening to a message before you can make out all of the words.
2,Sound quality poor,The sound quality was poor to begin with but after several months of use I couldn't even understand my messages anymore. The machine also has a habit of erasing my outgoing message and replacing it with it's automated factory message
3,A fatal flaw,"This answering machine works well in all respects save one.The quality of the message playback is really bad. It sounds like a speeded-up audiotape. If the caller doesn't leave a name because he/she thinks you will recognize the voice, you may not be able to tell who it is."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"What can I expect from a book with a cheap title and a cheap price? Well, it's not bad but all the info is loosely put together, and it is best served as an excellent intro book on the subject. Its 127 pages are rather good. Recommended as a quick intro and a stepping stone to more advanced learning on the subject."
4,the simpler side of neworder...,"stephen and gillian morris (gilbert) do have a certain style aside from neworder. stephen's usual style of wicked beats and deep rhythm is vitually non-existant due to the fact that he has gone the way of using computer sequencers instead of analog percusion... this loses something... if he would go insane like he use to when he was in joydivision or the earlier years of neworder, i know it would be incredible, but those days are gone... gillians keyboarding and vocals are fitting for the c.d. but ther is something still missing... what this project needed was the lyrics of bernard sumner and the lull-a-byes of peter hook's bass... this would make the package complete... otherwise, it is still a very good album..."
4,Happy!!!,"I have been looking for this cd for some time and was excited to see that I could get it through Amazon. The seller Jukeboxonline was very promt in sending it out, I received it in the condition as promised and very quickly. Love tracks 3 and 10. Over all this is a great cd."
4,Works well.,I failed to notice that this router is not mac compatible. I was unable to get it to connect with my Macbook or Ipod. But I ran it through my Linksys router and it is running great!
5,About The Complete Guide to Glass Painting,"I have just finished reading this book cover to cover and can't wait to start it again. It's written in a very friendly manner, as though the authors knew you personally. The instructions are detailed while easy to follow. It is packed with beautiful color illustrations. Most importantly, it contains techniques and applications that I could never have come up with on my own. I heartily recommend this book to anyone who is interested in painting on glass, regardless of your level of expertise. It's worth every penny!"
5,EXCELLENT STORY,"This is the first book that I have read that really seem to go along with history with Queen Elizabethan times. What a history lesson, I think if we were taught history with the passion that the book was written I would have paid more attention to it in school. Iris Johansen is a great writer and I will be looking for her other historical romances."
4,strong arm is holding up quite nicely,Fairly easy to install took a few minutes. Recommend reading the directions first. Have a flathead ready. Thats all you need.
4,StrongArm Lifts,"Bought these lifts the other day and just put them on my 1998 Cherokee. Install was a breeze and much easier than changing these on other trucks that I've done. The factory lifts never really worked when I bought the truck used in 2004 and right away these made a drastic improvement to the lift. Now the rear gate won't slam on my head everytime. I'm giving it four stars for ease of install, and initial value. TBD in the long run."
3,Your Dragon Viet-Cong Scout's best friend!,"I got the Linh Dragon Viet-Cong figure and loved her. I'm obsessed with the Vietnam war for some reason. Anyway, I thought that the Ultimate Soldier VC uniform would be great to put another 12"" asian figure in.I got a nude Tak figure and slipped him.... looked great! The quality is pretty sharp, and the accessories are nice, considering the simplicity of the jumpsuit. The folding bayonet on the rifle is a particularly nice detail.But once you get to trying to get the sandals on your figure.... good luck! One of the straps immediately bust when I was putting it on the figure's foot. The second sandal basically bust apart completely!Seems that the straps are attached to the sole in such a way that they're more narrow than a figure's feet!! How dissappointing. Now I'm on the look out for little black rubber bands to keep them on...All well, at least Linh's not alone. :)"
2,But it's badly made,"The camera itself and the features are fairly decent, but the contruction is abysmal. After about 3 months the power button dissapeared inside the camera. I notice this is not the first report of this, so it's most likely a fundamental design flaw. I'm wiating for Aiptek to contact me on this, I think they should be responsible.---Several days after writing this Aiptek contacted me, and gave me an RMA number. After 3-4 weeks they sent me a new camera. There are slight design changes in the newer camera, I can't tell if the power button has changed, but the wheel that makes your selection and the door that hides the memory card have both been improved. I would give this 4 stars now, if I could."
3,Zareba Portable Corral System,"The Electric tape and battery operated electric system work well, however the poles are very flimsey, and bend easily with the slightest resistance. It was impossible to keep the tape from sagging because the poles are weak and have so much bend. I had to use additional fiberglass rods to keep the tape off the ground."
1,E500 Battery Drain and inconsistent focus,"Do not buy this camera. Battery drain is fast even with rechargables. Regular AA batteries do not even work in mine. New batteries will not even power it up. I'm going to buy more of the most powerful rechargables and keep many nearby. My wife hates camera, will not use.Many times it loses its focus ability. You have to power down and back up again and cross fingers. When it works, it takes good pictures, but frustration level is high. Shutter lag is bad, you will miss the action. Stay away."
3,Story technical side weighs down the dramatic side.,"I'm a big fan of historical fiction, and ""Fatherland"" is one of my favorite books but this novel by Robert Harris was too thick in technical cryptanalst speak to hook me. The reveals were somewhat less dramatic had I completely followed all the code-breaking jargon. Sadly, when the ""villain"" was revealed it seemed pretty anticlimatic. Definitely not Harris' best work."
4,A great follow up for Harris,"Harris does a great job following up the predecessor, FATHERLAND. When you have a book as great as FATHERLAND, it is going to be hard to write a novel without a tremendous amount of scrutiny from readers. Tom Jerico is the most unlikely of hereos that solves the mystery without the use of superhuman intellect and powers (alla James Patterson novels). The ending did not come with a suspenseful bang, but the tone of the book did not fortell a huge climax. A great book with a realistic ending. Definitely going to be stored on the shelf to be read again someday."
4,Really entertaining read,"i grabbed this book before heading out the door for a business trip. it made for great reading on flights and late at night in my hotel room. i found the story to be interesting and well paced. as has been stated, this is a great mystery set against the historic backdrop of the WWII code-breakers in bletchley park. these guys were true heroes that in many cases, never saw the light of day, let alone a battlefield, yet were responsible for saving countless lives.i also feel the need to chime in on this (as have other reviewers): if you enjoy this book, take a look at neal stephenson's cryptonomicon. it's a large volume, but well worth the read."
4,The pages kept turning,"Great read, gives a good insight into the achievement of the British during the 2nd world war in cracking Enigma, a great feat of intellect and organisation.Book is a page turner, not quite as polished as some of his later work, but excellent nonetheless."
3,"Dont know,since I have forgotten what it is about.","Yes I know ,it was something about the 2nd world war.But in a lot of ways was difficult to understand. Confusing,I would say."
4,Surprisingly good,"This wartime thriller pleasantly surprised me, considering that I picked it up off the airport bookstore rack to bide some time. The storyline is intellectually robust, even with its modest, uneventful ending, and does an excellent job of bringing us inside the hive-like decoding community that arguably provided wartime England's finest contribution to the fight. The mechanics of encryption were occasionally tough to follow, but a bit of careful reading did the trick. Harris is maturing nicely as a writer; his FATHERLAND had a terrific first half and a downright mushy finale. This book is much more of a complete read, perfect for curling up in front of a fire or on the bus. I'll read more by Harris."
5,Brilliant Englishman who finally comes of age.,Wonderful story. Great history lesson. The image I carry away is of Churchill standing on a rooftop knowing where the German bombs are to fall and not being able to say a word to protect the Enigma secret. A well written extremely good read.
2,No in car remotes included.,When you open your box make sure everything is included before you have someone install it. Our door is installed and did not have the in car remotes.
3,"Opener fine, extension kit wrong, keyless pad wrong","The garage door opener worked fine. Very easy to install but the Amazon documentation for accessories is lacking or wrong. I ordered the extension kit for a ""chamberlain chain drive"" but found out after receipt that there are 2 different types of chain drives. The correct kit for this model is a 7708CB which you have to search for by model # in order to find it on Amazon. I also ordered the keyless CLK1 which is listed as an accessory for this drive. It is incompatable with this opener and I had to return it. The correct compatable model is a Chamberlain 940D. Amazon doesn't carry that model and since the descriptions for other keyless openers did not give enough information to insure that I would not get the wrong item again, I ordered it elsewhere."
5,Works Good,I decided on this opener because extreme cold (-20) has caused problems with others. The opener is quiet and instilation and assembly are straight foreward. The door should be reinforced where the opener attaches to prevent damage if the door bottom freezes to the floor. I wish all the manufactures would have a better mounting method for attaching the motor unit to the ceiling. The one supplied is adequite but nothing to brag about.
3,"Great performances, but...","it won't teach you how to play like Dave Weckl. Features several live performances of Dave with his bands, and if you didn't think Dave was The Man before, you will when you see this. Camera work and production is top notch. I find it very frustrating that Dave really only gives a few lessons, and they are extremely basic. He doesn't break apart what he's playing in the songs. The DVD is probably worth having just for the performances, but as far as learning to play like Dave... his ideas go by VERY fast."
5,"easy install, best deal for the money","i have owned several systems and sound cards, this card is the best for the money. if you are looking for 5.1 sounds, save some money and buy this card. installed on vista and 7.driver link: [...] scroll down untill you find SBT-SP6C 5.1 PCI card. easy as pie.like other reviewer said throw away the cd and just download these ^^^Prime next day delivery 3.99! go Amazon : )"
1,crap,I bought this piece of junk and regret very much. The disk it came with doesn't work. No manual how to connect the speakers. No support to talk to. The microphone records very low. Stay out of this product.
1,Did not work in 2 computers.,"Did not work , and believe me I tried ever trick there is even tried another computer, eventually got one out of my old parts box and it was plug and play in about 5 min , but used the software from the new one, should ask for refund but was not worth the hassle . Will go to geeks for future pc parts."
5,Arendt is still important,"Hannah Arendt is a political philosopher whose work is still highly relevant and inspirational. This selection of her writings, essays and excerpts from her books aims to give the scope of her ideas to the full. That includes her work on the human mind, the role of imagination, and the human condition. But there is also a full coverage of her political writings that relate to the history of the Jewish people in the 20th century. These analyses rank among the very best that have been written on the subject in history. The reader can follow the emergence of such widely-known concepts like ""the banality of evil"", concepts that Arendt examines with clarity and intelligence."
5,The thinking-man's horror anime,"Betterman is, in a word, hypnotic. A blending of genres as subtle as it is sublime, this takes the best aspects of horror, mecha, ""kaijuu"" and tokusatsu, and just the right dash of ""school kid"" stories as its raw materials. The output is a downright harrowing journey down the trail of a mysterious killer and an even more mysterious conspiracy covering its tracks. Produced by Bandai's best artists, with character designs by the unrivaled Kimura Takahiro, this show somehow retains its psychological horror atmosphere episode after episode, even with all the action and moments of levity. While this show will probably go over some people's heads, it hits me squarely between the eyes. Excellent stuff."
1,I'd rate zero stars if I could...,"I ended up cutting the thing off my phone and throwing it in the garbage.Perhaps the root cause of my problem was that I don't possess the musculature necessary to get this to fit - or to remove the phone from the case to try to refit it...Once the case was on my phone, it was on for good. Unfortuately due to misalignment I couldn't plug the phone into its charger, nor could I snap the case closed. My 230 lb boyfriend couldn't remove it either.AAAArrrggggghhhh!"
2,Protection? What protection!,"I bought this case for one reason. And that reason was to protect my phone. Yea, sure it worked for 2 months, MAYBE! Then after that, I looked at my phone to make a call and the screen was cracked. And that was WITH the case on. The reason I gave it two stars instead of one was because it fit tightly around my phone and I was able to get to it guickly when I needed in an emergency. So, if you don't care that it won't protect your phone, go ahead and get it, but otherwise, don't get this case."
2,nothing to speak of in the boxes,"The person I sent it to said I hope u didn't spend to much on this, because u paid for pretty boxes there was not much in them."
3,Good,"A nice compilation of their hits (and a few misses). The good stuff makes up for those, though so a worthwhile purchase."
5,great product,"I bought these for my boyfriend to use for his gaming while I'm doing my homework. He has dropped them I don't know how many times and I'm sure done more to them that I don't know about. I would say they are fairly durable. Great buy for the buck. The only thing that he has complained about is that he can hear outside interference while he's gaming. He says they are comfortable and loud, just what he wanted...well minus the speaker phone which would defeat the purpose of me having quiet time when I need it."
1,Litter box mat,"This no track litter mat is terrible. It doesn't catch any litter at all. Since it is plastic, the litter just slides right off. There was still litter everywhere, it did not help one bit. I would not recommend this product, it is useless."
3,a bit annoying,this is a decent kids christmas cd but the kids voices are a bit annoying. Not too bad but not a favorite for me.
1,Horrible book!,"There were no redeeming qualities in this book. The story - which started with an interesting premise - was so poorly written that it couldn't keep me interested. I plugged along through this book, and by the time I finished, I was desperately wishing that I could turn back the hands of time and NOT waste my time.The story had no continuity, the characters were relatively vapid, and the flashbacks were utterly annoying. I know that Laymon is supposed to have a great cult following, but based on THIS book, I can't see it."
4,Good referencing material.,Comprehensive and detailed explanation on different types of casting. A good referencing material if you're new to do life-casting on various part of the body/head.
1,poor product for the money,"Very frustrating, plastic stand for the camera. No picture in less than daylight, sound is ok. Instant on doesn't work unless on batteries, so it's useless while plugged in. EVERYTHING interferes with the picture. CAVEAT EMPTOR"
2,Not worth the money,I bought this monitor for my five month old. I am not sure why I even bothered.. you can't see anything at night unless the overhead light is on. Do you want to sleep with the light on? Neither does my son! Otherwise it is very easy to set up and you can see pretty clearly when the lights are on.
2,"Nice, but not practical","This camera was beautiful when we tested it. The picture was clear and the sound was reasonable. However, when we put it in the baby's room at night, there was no picture. We had to have all the lights on in his room to make the picture visable. So, as a security camera, I'm sure this will work great, but as a baby monitor, it's not very practical."
5,Awesome,"I have now purchased 5 of these. Two for me and one each for wife and kids.I use Creative Audigy 4 for my pc home theater and these headphones are a very good choice. While not noise cancelling, we use them in the gym at the YMCA and have trouble hearing anyone else while woking out and watching the on screen shows.If you are on a tight budget and looking for a reliable headphone that will not send you to the poor house, this is an Awesome Deal."
5,A very important read,"Richard Louv was one of the first social scientists to document the detrimental effect that decreasing time in nature is having on everyone, particularly children. HIs term, ""Nature deficit disorder"" very likely describes why so many of our children our obese, depressed, anxious and medicated. Unlike those of us boomers who were allowed to run free, create our own games, and explore our environments, children today are over-protected, outdoor play has become ""criminalized"" (too much liability), and everything is either a ""play date"", adult run highly competitive sports, or hours in front of a screen."
2,Last child in The Woods,This sounded good from the reviews and the philosophy is near to my heart but it is typically American and overstated.I never finished reading it as the gist was given in the first few chapters.Moral Don't believe everything the reviewers say and look out for books in OXFAM two years after publication later.
5,The Adventure Rabbi says,"Whenever someone does not understand what we do at the Adventure Rabbi program, I ask them to read this book! As Louv teaches, (an echo of Rabbi Ben Maimonides) outdoor time is essential for the spiritual development of even the holiest of people.- Rabbi Jamie Korngold, the Adventure Rabbi, author God in the Wilderness: Rediscovering the Spirituality of the Great Outdoors with the Adventure Rabbi"
4,Great read,"Having grown up outdoors most of my life, I thought this book was insightful and a signpost to stop and think about my own daughter and how she'll grow up appreciating outdoors the same way I do."
4,Great insight!,This book gives extraordinary insight into the deficits our kids have in this generation. It describes how the lack nature effects on our children.
5,A must read for parents,This book addresses the techno worlds of children while giving suggestions and info about how important it is for children to have close encounters with the natural world. If only we could all give our children these important opportunities.
2,"UM, LET ME CLEAR MY THROAT","Okay, so this is Converges side project. And there hasnt been much hype or news on it, why? Because it basically sucks.I love Converge, and thought this would sound just like it, but it was way too experimental for me.I mean, its nice if you have the patience to listen to it, but it just never amounts to much. Really.Some interesting parts but overall nothing you would like. If you like long and tedious songs that go no where, then check it out. Otherwise, stay away and save your money for say, the NEW CONVERGE!"
1,Careful - Not a Dozen,"Be careful before ordering this item.In the product description it says that these pencils are sold as a ""dozen"" - which of course means there are supposed to be 12 pencils. However, when I ordered them (from the seller ""TCP Global Corp."") the package had just one pencil.To top it off, I contacted them about it almost a full month ago and they never replied.Keep in mind I'm not rating the actual pencils, they could be just fine. I'm just saying that, should you order them, expect to get just one pencil instead of twelve."
3,correction,"I have to admit, this is a good album. Pat is a sensitive player and I have loved his playing over the years, particulary the duo album with Charlie Haden. Alway lyrical, interesting harmonies, pleasant vibes come out of his guitar. This album should earn him a few more followers."
2,"""Have a seat. The doctor/dentist will be with you in a moment...""","I like Brad Mehldau. I really do. And I kind of like Pat Metheny. But I have never been a big huge fan of jazz guitar, and unfortunatley, that's what Pat plays. So, I tried not to think too hard about what was in store for me. I tried to believe that as a jazz musician, I would be able to learn from this music. I tried to believe that Mehldau would balance out the guitar and I would actually enjoy this CD. I even listened to it more than once (more than twice) to see if maybe I started to ""get"" it or it grew on me. Unfortunately, the only thing that happened is I discovered where dentists and doctors get their piped in waiting room music. Some people may like this album, but it is definitely not my cup of hot mocha."
4,A Four Star Wonder,"My best friend introduced me to them and I attended a performance at the House of Blues in Cambridge, MA - and I was blown away. They are a stunning clash of musical types: Pink Floyd, Radiohead, Dave Matthews. They create flowing sounds with haunting, honest lyrics. They can move a crowd with any song they choose to play."
2,Disapointed,I feel that the picture misrepresents the product that I received.Approx.80% were black and 5% each of the other colors.Not good value.Seller does not disclose % of each color so no recourse.
5,Love peppercorn,"This five peppercorn mix is great with everything we cook. It goes on all the foods we cook or grill, and also on all the sandiwches we make. It's a wonderful mixture of peppercorns."
5,Very nice finish nailer,"I bought this for DIY trim work around the house, and it works very well for this purpose. It was inexpensive and functions very well. I have had no problems. I had one nail jam that I cleared easily. If I were a professional, I would probably need a higher grade tool, but for homeowner tasks this was an excellent purchase."
4,"looks good, right price","These are decorative, nicely spray coated steel. The hook system is on one side. Make sure you consider how deep you will need to push them in soil to seat the edging, as it will impact your height when done."
1,Alli doesnt work,"Tried taking Alli with absolutely no results. I even purposely took it with a high fat meal just to see if I had any undesirable responses they warn about on the label. Nothing happened. I dont know if I got a bad batch, or they changed thier formula. I remember taking Alli when it first came out years ago and it seemed to work then."
1,Unbearable Cramping and Gas,"The first few days I took this it didn't have much effect. But by the thrid day I started having stomach pains, then tremendous gas. I never had a problem with the staining, but I don't eat 15 gms of fat in any one meal. As time went on the stomach pains and cramping and the constant gas became unbearable. This product affects people in different ways and it seems I really don't eat enough fat for it to make it much of a significant weight loss product, so why suffer?"
2,Just Started with Alli,"Okay- I just started Alli 3 days ago. The first day I had terrible ""trapped"" gas, the kind that doubles you over in hopes you will be able to ""release"" something. The second day it wasn't that bad, and much to my husband's dismay I was able to release the trapped gas. Today was the third day and I barely noticed any gas. I have had none of the other, more violent side affects... no oily discharge or anything.And I know I ate some food with more than 15 grams of fat!That said, I am really on the fence. No noticable weight loss yet. I am going to stick it out since I paid for the starter kit, and only time will tell if its worth continuing. If the only reason it works is by scaring the user out of eating fattening food for fear of side effects, then it seems pretty ridiculous. But we will see!"
1,Alli not my Ally!,Tried this product to break my plateau. Didn't work for me. I'm thinkin' I don't eat enough fat for it to work the way proclaimed. Won't buy again.
1,I had many gastrointestinal side effects,"Before eating I consume a pill, and the gastrointestinal side effect such as diarrhea, flatulence and constipation continue asociated with pain in stomach. and this continue almost three days after the ingestio of the pill."
2,Alli,"This product gave me terrible pains in my side (I want to say in the liver region). I quit taking it and in a few days those pains went away. I was afraid to continue with it. I really didn't see any weight loss in the 10 days that I tried it. I decided just to try vegetarian, occiaionally fish, and whole grains (not too much starch). It sees to be working and I feel much healthier. I exercise a great deal, but don't lose weight. This product didn't do it for me."
2,No doest work as advertised,"Taking alli does make you loose the fat you just ate, but to loose a lot of weight you must be taking it all the time and for at least a month. That would be ok, but you have diarrhea for that whole time and with that a lot of accidents, if you know what I mean. Your stomach will make weird noises and you also have to excercise a lot, not just sit at home and eat and loose weight. Doesnt work just like that. Unless you can take a month off from work, not worth the money."
3,The Math Behind Alli,"Alli makes 25% of the fat you consume with your three daily pills indigestible. It also requires that you eat no more than 15 grams of fat at these meals if you want to avoid the ""treatment effects"". Therefore, Alli eliminates 25% of 45 grams of fat a day (assuming you eat the max), which is 11.25 grams. As there are 9 calories per gram of fat, Alli eliminates 100 calories a day from your diet. In other words, Alli will knock a pound off you every 5 weeks (there are approximately 3500 calories in a pound of fat). That said, there is more to Alli. Its highly publicized ""treatment effects"" are in fact its greatest asset. If you're looking for a surefire way to curb your fat intake, look no further. Fear of soiling your pants is a powerful motivator!"
1,The big Rip Off,If you had checked my account you would have seen that this Seller used Amazon marketplace to steal from me. Thanks for adding insult to injury since Amazon told me their was nothing they could do to refund my loss.So My review is......
1,Does Not Work As Claimed,"I am through with diet pills this was my last resort, my advise for people have been struggling with weight as my self, just stick to a healthy diet and walk or run at least 30 mins a day for 3 to 4 days to get your heart rate going at least. Stop using these over the counter diet pills that claim results, because the don't I have had weight issues for 9 yrs after my son was born, have tried just about everthing, including ACAI Berry, Alli, Green Tea, Laxative, Colon Cleanse and my list goes on and on, believe me as I am honest, now I eat least white rice, only eat whole grain bread, eggs, yogurt, fish as heathly as I can and I stared walking 3x's a week for 30 mins, am not seeing dramatic results but at least I feel better, energized and stay away from fast food as much as I can. I can go on and on, but just eat healthier and try walking at least, stop wasting money on these products that do not work."
1,High cost for?,Did Not do anything for me! To high of a cost just to try. Better look at something that does not have a high price to try out.
2,not good for moderate weight loss,"I was hoping to lose less than 20 pounds with this, but I think if you are really close to your ideal weight it going to help very little. Very few side effects, probably because I eat a low fat already. Not recommended if you are close to your ideal weight"
2,Doesn't work for me!,"I am sorry, but it doesn't worked for me, i was taken for 2 weeks and i had no changes on my weight! i was eating well etc!I am 25lbs over weight, maybe just work for more!"
3,not really needed,If you drink ten glasses of water a day and eat the low fat diet you'll lose the weight. Buy the alli book or south beach for recipes an you'll be better served.
2,Okay for use when trying to consume a low fat diet,I did not find this product helpful and I guess I should have read the instructions where it clearly says that if you already follow a low fat diet this product will not help you. I was already eating pretty healthy!
1,DON'T BUY FROM AMAZON!!,"This is a Placebo and nothing more! I usually buy from walmart but could save $5.00 by purchasing thru Amazon LLC, and I gained all my weight back! If your smart, Dont Buy!!"
3,Promising,"The artist looses himself in the crowd of mainstream tecno beats. The only vocal/song has very weak lyric . The rest of the tracks sound same , same rythm .Nothing unique . Some Depache M. , Bad Enigma and some Dream theater sums up the album. But He proves his capability in making music (Not yet good music).Hopefully this young artist will surprise us with his next album ."
2,Disappointed,"If you're absolutely obsessed with Sondheim, you'll possibly like this recording. I find him a genius, but he has one of the worst voices I've ever heard. Don't turn up the volume while playing it or you'll have every dog in the neighborhood howling."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I've purchaseed two At&T phone systems. In both cases, in a little over one year of use the batteries needed to be replaced, which may be reasonable considering the heavy use the phones got. However, what I do not feel is reasonable is that in both cases I was unable to purchase a replacement battery from the store where I made the purchase(Target), or any other retailer selling phone batteries in Minneapolis. The modelshad been ""discontinued"" and the replacement batteries were available only from AT&T at a cost of aboout $20.00 each, plus a shipping cost of $12.00. In both cases AT&T was still making and selling a very similiar phone (cordless, two handset 2.4 GHZ system), but the battery was not compatable."
2,Sent me the wrong one,"Sent me the wrong one. THe return policy was very convoluted, but the mistake batch of movies was better than ol Johns horrible acting."
3,No Disc Title or Art,"Although the movies and quality is great, I was disappointed to find that the discs did not have any type of art or title on them. You have to manually label them with a marker, making them look unprofession and more like flea market copies."
4,John Wayne Classics,"Great Quality. Who can turn down a good John Wayne Western. It is still nice to see movies without sex, and bad language. My 3 year old watches these movies with me and loves them. Quality family time."
5,TWILIGHT,"ALWAYS GOOD MYSTERY. I AM A BLACK AND WHITE CLASSIC FILM PERSON. IT HELPS ME TO SLOW DOWN IN LIFE AND TAKE MY TIME WHEN THE WORLD IS ALWAYS RUSHING AND GETTING NO WHERE. THESE OLD FILMS HELPS/ALLOW ME TO RELAX. TWILIGHT ZONE PICTURES ARE ALWAYS GREAT AND LEAVES YOU TO YOUR IMAGINATION AFTER EACH SCENE. IF YOU ARE A TCM.COM FAN AND AN ALFRED HITCHCOCK FAN, THIS WILL DO YOU JUSTICE TO PURCHASE. I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."
2,Very good Narration - but very poor audio engineering on CDs,"E. W. Jeffries reading this version of the Bible is a great work. I wish the CD mastering and CD audio engineering were equally as good. On 3 CD's in the New Testament, the last few tracks simply can not be heard because of skipping and clipping. The white space compression between words and sentences is excessive resulting in last word in the spoken sentence not finishing. I understand from the Lockman Foundation that this CD set is being re-mastered to eliminate these issues. It will be well worth the wait to hear this excellent narration of this NASB properly recorded."
5,WONDERFUL!,GREAT GUITAR STRINGS BETTER THAN MY OLD ONES. MY GUITAR SOUNDS WONDERFUL AFTER STRINGS ARE BROKEN IN. I WILL DEFINITELY PURCHASE THESE CLASSICAL GUITAR STRINGS AGAIN. BUY! BUY! BUY!
3,Steve Gurber (HtD creator) would be proud.,"The way the movie tanked at the box office it's no surprise this book isn't more widely read. However, I have a soft spot for the film precisely because of the book. Weiner writes in a style reminiscent of Douglas Adams, fleshing out the story and adding some much needed humor.Whatever your opinion of the movie give this book a try."
5,An excellent book!,All I will say is that this is a good ending for the Operation Phoenix trilogy. A must have for all Hardy Boys fans.
1,Expensive and NOT impressive,"I just recently purchased this clock and am totally unimpressed. It sounded really cool from the description, and very unique. Well, it's unique because it's not a good clock. The aromatherapy part doesn't smell at all - you can HARDLY even notice it! The soothing sounds to wake up by (the chimes, flutes, etc...) repeat themselves after a second or two. The only nice feature is that the alarm starts quiet and gradually gets louder, but hardly a feature to off-set the... price tag! I would NOT recommend getting this clock if I were you."
5,Even if you are not sure whether your family was dysfunctional...,"This video has some amazingly helpful information in it. Its not just helpful if you are in therapy or are concerned about having a dysfunctional family background, the lessons here are useful for everyone. You can learn a bit about the impossible standards and expectations we have for ourselves and those around us and begin to see where this comes from and how to change it. Great information you can learn in a short period of time! I also recommend checking out the other videos on here by the same therapist--just do a search for Jef Gazley!"
1,disgusting,Geriatric hardcore. It's unlike the rest Wharton's books which I liked very much. I wish I had missed it.
1,poor quality,The red lining came off just after a month of use. Looks like a simple glass half lined now. Not worth the price.
1,Not good,"The holes on the feeder are too big which allows bees, lots of bees, to get into it. This makes cleaning it and changing the nectar difficult if not dangerous. As soon as the nectar is gone, this feeder will be going into the garbage. Big waste of money."
1,Gasket split when torqued to recommended 16.6 ft-lbs.,"The cork gasket split and leaks when installed. The one it replaced was a Cork-Covered, Steel Core, Oil Pan Gasket for a 1988 dodge D350 1 ton pickup truck. Do you have one that will work? I need a replacement before I remove the old one.I replaced it with used a Fel-Pro oil pan gaskets, made of molded rubber to prevent overtightening and torqied it to 10 ft-lbs not 16 ft-lbs as specified by Dodge.Mr. Gasket 394 Oil Pan Gasket"
2,Unfortunately a faulty product,"Hi to everyone who are seeking the best sound at the best price... I've just bought these creatures this morning for my pc but realized after the setup that touch sensitive volume buttons on little speakers are not working (It has fixed sound, I couldn't turn up or down the volume). There can't be any problem with my pc speaker connection because I was using cambridge soundworks (3 piece: 2 speakers + 1 subwoofer), and it was working fine for almost 6 years. In addition to that, speaker's connection with the subwoofer is so sensitive that with a tiny movement of the subwoofer the sound cut off. You have to turn it off and then on again (Needless to say, I checked the connections couple of times). So, as some of the other unfortunate critics say I believe this is a faulty product. Why 2 stars ? It's noting to do with the sound, it is for the cool design. If you still insist on that product, it's your choice but I would say try it before purchase."
2,"No Midrange, not all they are cracked up to be.","I was looking for a resonably priced 2.1 speaker system. But the sound quality has to be at least better than the speakers that come free with most computers. This setup does not cut it at all, a bigger midrange speaker would have cured this issue. Sorry JBL. Not sure why there are so many positive reviews out there, the little speakers have no midrange at all. They are going back in the box."
4,Great product for the price,"Absolutely great sounding speakers for their size and cost. Great for a room and computer setup. They get loud but not loud enough for a party or a full movie experience but perfect for a bedroom, apartment or dorm room.They look great and have big bang for the size.Only con is that the little satelites have green lights that always stay on and the power button is on the back of the sub. Not ideal but doesn't make a difference to me but for the super power conscience might worry about that extra watt each night..."
2,Plastic taste,"I am not happy with this product. It has a plastic taste to the water. I have tried everything to get rid of it and it does not seem to work.I have been in contact with the company that manufactured it and they want me to send it back and I have no way of doing that or do I have the box that it came in, the ox was damaged in shipment.I have no idea what to do this is a waste of my money. If there is anyway that you can help, please do. I would never purchase another igloo product.Thank youDebra Kannry"
3,OK PROCUCT,"I HAVE HAD THIS ITEM FOR 3 YEARS NOW. IT IS STRONG AS AN OX, AND I USE IT FOR MULTIPLE THINGS. I WISH THE 3-PT LINE WASNT SO CLOSE TO THE TOP OF THE KEY, BUT ITS FINE OVERALL, GOOD PROUCT."
3,"Fan of the cool, ""Tool of the man"".","I'm no fanatic, so I can't compare this 3rd album to others of theirs. But basically it's your typical indie/punk disc from 1993. Sounds kinda like ""Mudhoney"" or old ""Sonic Youth"" to me. But whatever, it's a decent listen. The coolest thing about ""Tool of the Man"" is the insert. The cover is a green, yellow, and black U.S. flag, that when you stare at it for 20 seconds and look away, you see it in red, white, and blue. Then inside is one of those ""Minds Eye"" things that you look at and see a 3-D picture. Like one of those posters for children."
1,don't waste your money on this pump,"I bought one of these pumps. Sat on the shelf for about a year and a half. About a week ago I had to pump a little bit of water out of the bottom of my pool. Pump ran for about 20 minutes and then stopped. I thought a fuse was blown. I thought the pump was clogged. Pulled the pump out of the pool. It was smoking hot and NOT clogged. Let it cool down. Assuming it was ""Thermally Protected"" as the label clearly stated. In the end, motor frozen, pump useless, in the trash. THIS PUMP STINKS! Response from Flotec; ""Out of warranty."" Run away!!!I have a very small marine 'Rule Automatic 500 GPH 12 Volt Bilge Pump'. Had it for 10+ years. Run dry many many times. NEVER fails. Think it was $50 on sale at West Marine. Moral of the story. Just because it big and expensive doesn't mean it any good."
4,A bit of a pain to configure...,"...but once set up, connects quickly and hasn't dropped out on me in a week now.Read the instructions for this, if you're used to slapping one in and letting Windows do the Plug'n'Play thing, then putting the driver disk in when it can't find the right drivers on it's own, you'll end up going through a bunch of steps to straighten it back out. I'm using it for an older WinBook with XP Home SP3. I charged right in, and it ended up with me taking a couple of hours to get it working right. D'oh! Should have known better, I've got certs in IT.If you have Vista or 7, they may have the right drivers, I just know that XP w/SP3 does not."
3,Pcmcia Network Card,I purchased this for a Linux Ubuntu Computer but there are no drivers available.I will keep it in case I reload the computer with Windows.
5,Very interesting,Some gripping pilot adventures and some agonizing accounts of outrageous pilot blunders add up to a memorable read.
1,i love this movie,This is an awesome movie it was a good old romantic vampire love story and i love them kind of movies it was great
4,can get tiring........,"good, solid, game. but the AI isn't anything speicial. eventually you get tired of seeing the same battle happen over and over and over again. The campaign is not that great either. if youre looking for a good campaign get red alert 2 and yuris revenge."
5,everything I expected and love about Command & Conquer,"many, many hours of fun! not easy to beat even on easy setting! you have to work at it. had to restart game several times till I kicked its but!"
4,Great Classic,"I missed this game. I remember having purchased it when it originally came out. Sometime between then and now I lost those discs, and was forced to buy this version here. Definitely brought back some memories. Only issue I had with it is because its an older game it doesnt like wide screen monitors, I am sure there are fixes out there to fix that issue, but none the less still a fun game."
1,"Very racist, bloated, and not made by Westwood","Warning! This game is extremely racist! If you are a fan of Westwood's other games, like Dune 2, Dune 2000, Emperor, etc. and like playing the Noble Atreides so you can side with the Fremen, you will really not like this game!If you hate arabs, and to a lesser extent, asians, then you might like this game.This game isn't actually made by Westwood, and it shows. Not just in the racism, but many things about this game feel different.Also the system requirements for this game are ridiculous. It requires loads of hard disk space and a very fast machine. Definately not a game for those with old computers.I loved all the other Command & Conquer games, but this one I uninstalled fairly quickly."
1,bad karma,"Why would I want to buy a book by people who allow their publishers to undertake such obvious trickery? God knows what ""tactics"" they would suggest to get your lover back. The reconciliation would probably only last as long as these guy's careers!"
4,"It's basically a cover band, but a once in existence interpretation","Anyway, the common perception that more than 50% of Miles Davis fans are complete elitist dikwads is proven here. 'nuff said.Good recording and really an amazing job by ""Q"" to take these masterpieces and reinterpret them with a big band sound."
1,complete garbage,"Save your time and just put your money in the trash. Terrible quality. Terrible customer support. Had to wait all day for call back from customer support and was then told the agent I had talked with was not working that day and nothing could be done till she came in the next day. when I asked for a supervisor I was told I was speaking with one. When I expressed my frustration I was told the other agent seems to have ""messed up my warrantee"" submission, but again ""nothing can be done till she comes in tomorrow""!!??!! Finally I was told that the replacement pieces were ""likely backordered from China and who knows when they will arrive."" Again I say; save you gas and time and just put $[...] in the trash.Avoid this manufacturer at all costs!"
5,Post apocolyptic writing at its best,"Great writing and an excellent story by one of this genres best writers. Not an easy book to track down; I waited 8 weeks for delivery , but well worth the wait."
1,Do Not Buy!! Waste of Money!!,"This book is totally outdated, not detailed enough, and completely vague. I had to refer to other advertising books when I read this book because it was so BAD! Everthing in this book was really vague and the authors contradict themselves. One minute they reccommend a particular stragety--the next minute they say the strategy doesn't work--therefore it becomes confusing and not detailed enough. Do not buy this book because it is a waste of money and it is completely outdated--old school information, which is useless."
1,Coconut Milk,"I bought this product and am sorry I did. I tried one can and it was nothing like coconut milk I have used in the past. There is a hard, greasy 1 inch glob at the top of the can and the rest is clear water. It has no flavor and doesn't even resemble coconut milk. If I want to return it, I have to pay the shipping and a 15% restock charge. Not sure it's worth it. May donate to the Food Bank."
2,Zipper is a bust!,"Though the backpack is a great size for a Kindergartener, and I probably shouldn't complain because of the cheap price, but the zipper is a bust. It keeps getting snagged and is at the point of almost breaking. We can only zip it one way (it has 2 zippers, but one way doesn't work now). I'm purchasing a backup backpack to have on hand for WHEN the zipper does break."
3,Only for short term use,"I have two daughters and they only used the bookbags for a summer for camp. All kids are rough with their items but these bookbags fell apart in such a short time. I usually buy them Jansport which will usually last throughout the year, but for camp I figured I'd get a cheaper bag since it was just for the summer. If you are looking for a bag that will last with your kids then this may not be the bag for them."
3,Brazilian jazz classic,"Quarteto Negro""Quarteto Negro""(Kuarup Records, 1987)-----------------------------------I'm assuming this listing is for the Brazilian jazz album by the Quarteto Negro, a one-off band featuring clarinetist/sax player Paulo Moura, vocalist Zeze Motta, bassist/guitarist Jorge Degas and drummer Djalma Correa... Folks looking onto deep-roots Brazilian jazz might want to check this one out. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Brazilian Music)"
4,Flying (fairly) High,"This is easily Erin McKeown's tightest and most coherent album. It flows consistently throughout and every song is good. Unfortunately it lacks the sparks of brilliance that lit up her two previous records--though to it's credit, it also lacks the clear misses that you find on those albums. Her lyrical confidence is as high as ever, and the musicianship on display is excellent. If only there were one shining moment on the album, it would easily outpace her earlier work, but its consistency is in part its greatest drawback. There's no arguing that McKeown's work is a cut above most of the music you'll find on store sheles these days, so you won't regret adding this disc to your collection."
5,very heart touching,"I cried in every single stories of this book. they are very touching. and yes, i could relate to all of the stories in there, especially the stories on very premature babies. the stories definitely gave me hopes on my baby's future (who was born 10 weeks premature). this book is really a good source for parents with premature babies."
2,It scared me...,"I was given this book as a gift a week after my son was born at 1 lb. 13. oz. It scared me to read about all the terrible things that went wrong with other parents' babies, and I couldn't finish the book. However, there is a great chapter in the book that explains the feelings of a recently-made 'preemie parent' that I could really relate to, and a wonderful poem/prayer to the doctors and nurses of the NICU. It's a book that perhaps I can appreciate now that my son is home and doing well, but I would hesitate to give it to any new 'preemie parent'."
3,Med Gain Indoor Antenna,"I was not impressed with this piece of hardware. 1st of all it comes with only 1 line and 2 of my routers have 2. So, I use 1 of them for the Hawking aqnd I did not get any better results with it. Am I doing something wrong? How do you connect a 2 line router antenna with 1? HA17SIP Gain?"
2,So firm - read that HARD - we sent it back,"I am loathe to write a bad review for anyone or anything: but this gel seat cushion, for the money, was worthless.It is SO firm that it didn't seem to displace any weight; rather, it was just a nuisance under the bottom. And don't bother buying it if you have a... um... larger backside because you won't fit on it anyway.I gave it 2 stars because (a) it got here fast; and (b) it was, in fact, a gel-filled seat cushion. And it might actually WORK for someone out there... just not us.For the money, go buy a couple of stadium seat cushions and sit on them. They will probably do more for you than this thing will. Oh well, we tried."
3,Not for those on a high-protein diet,"This book is probably heaven for celiacs, but for those who are just looking to avoid wheat (not all gluten) it may not fit the bill. I am on a high-protein diet and the suggested flour mixes that contain CUPS of cornstarch would probably put me in a hypoglycemic coma! If you are looking for recipes for alternate flours just because you are seeking a healthier diet, this probably isn't your best bet."
5,My Bread Bible,After experimenting with so many others this book wasthe best. Buying gf free bread at the grocery storewas a disaster. Great source.
1,Endorsement for a product not available in my area,"This is not the book for someone trying to make their own Gluten free bread at home, using locally found produce as this book endorses the use of manufactured ingredients namely :Garfava flour ( chickpea and fava bean mix) the author states that this product gives the best results and all of the main recipes contain it.The glossary is the place to find where to have these items shippedit just seems to be an expensive Company advertisement flyer that used to come free with regular flour products 50 yrs ago.very very disappointed I will never purchase any books by the author.This book should carry a statement explaining that it is a company recipe book.Also most people who are Gluten free also have other allergies and these recipes use eggs and gellatine, another no no.There are better books on the market...avoid this at all costs"
5,Delicious well tested recipes,"I have been using Ms Hagman's book for six months, trying different recipes, eating only bread from this book. Every recipe has been delicious and a welcome alternative to store-bought gluten-free bread. It's true that some recipes can be fine tuned to individual taste in regard to amount of sweetener used and flavorings, as is the case with all cookbooks. But the bread recipes work every time, have a good texture and excellent flavor. Life avoiding gluten is definitely better with this book in hand."
3,"Small, short, specific","It's not bad, and not good. It's just right in the middle. The book focuses solely on the nine Kuji-in finger seals and the most famous Kuji-kiri nine-syllable cut. I knew it would be scant when I bought it, so I got what I paid for... and at a decent price."
3,It's well constructed but delivers average sound quality,"I replaced the tubes with a $65 Tung Sol tube thinking that it would be a night and day exerience in terms of quality - that wasn't the case. Just like ALL things audio, and life for that matter, you get what you pay for."
5,Awsome Jump Blues,"Unbelievable. This CD absolutely rocks. Great vocals, original material and guitars."
5,An Awesome show...A must see for CR fans,"Cliff Richerd - The Event was a concert that takes place at the wembley stafium, London. A spectacular achievement of Song, dance and Good Old Rock n Roll. Cliff Richard has been a great singer song writer for 3 decades and performs some of his hits such as Some people, Move it, Summer Holidays and more.A great perfprmance..!!"
1,Read elsewhere,"""To a stranger driving 99,"" Joan Didion explains, ""these towns must seem so flat, so impoverished, as to drain the imagination."" Her attempts to then refute the accusation--as well as those attempts by her colleagues--fails in utterly and dismally epic proportions.Highway 99 disappoints terribly in its attempt to move the reader into some kind of passion for California's Central Valley. Even the selections from the most famous and established authors fall short of that goal. Even the composition of the book--its inner margins reduced so that the words disappear into the spine--disappoints. Only the pictures really provoke any dreamy, wistful imagination."
2,Where are the balls?,"I wasn't sure what I was going to get with this, but curiosity got the best of me. Never did get the golf balls, just the three-pack of comedy cds. The cds were amusing enough, but showing a 4-pack of golf balls for an item that didn't include any is quite misleading!"
2,Disappointed,We were disappointed in the condition of this used book. The first 68 pages were highlighted in yellow or orange.I wish we had known. We would have paid more to get it without the highlights.
2,Avoidable,"Of all the legal textbooks I've had to read in the past 2 years, this one by Fowler is my least favorite. Most annoying are the voluminous footnotes, which appear on every page and sometimes taking up 1/4 to 1/2 of the page. If an author needs to quote something, then they should just quote and parenthetically cite. Citations and notes are far better relegated to the end of a chapter. Otherwise, the extraneous text on every page is merely distracting and is not conducive to study.The book is also written in a ""chatty"" fashion, sounding more like a lecture than a textbook. There are many anecdotes and other bits of information that may be interesting, but wander from the point of the chapter.I would consider this a book to read at leisure by anyone interested in law, but in my opinion it is not suitable for use as a primary textbook."
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"My boys were really into collecting Mighty Beans so I bought this thinking it would give them something else to do with them. Please do not waste your money. It is cheaply made and does not stay together. If we could get it to stay together, someone else had to hold it so it didn't fall over when you set your bean on top. BEWARE!"
5,Great,I loved this DVD. It was a trip down memory lane. The only thing I regret about this is that I didn't spend a little more money and get the DVD with more episodes. I loved it!
5,Boxers + Ballerinas,"This movie opened my eyes to social and political issues right in our own backyard. The directors tell an important, unbiased story that you won't here about in U.S. public schools. Its worth seeing with friends so you can talk about it later. The stories in this movie are real snapshots of people's lives and it really keeps you wanting more........like taking one bite of a piece of rich chocolate cake."
3,Don't buy it if you want complete tab,"If you are a fan of Mr. Kaufman and Mr. Watson it is worth buying. I will enjoy watching the playing. That being said, if you are expecting the songs listed to be completely tabbed, you won't get it. Some of the songs just have the breaks tabbed. I bought it as a beginner who wanted to learn ""Little Sadie"". Granted it's advertised Level 3 (intermediate), but it's also advertised to include music and Tab. Homespun does great videos. To be honest I expected a little more."
1,Not A Paper Shedder,"This is under an ad as being a paper shedder that is showingfor sale,which shouldn't be.This is a false ad."
1,Huge Piece of Garbage,"DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA ! I have owned two so far, both have stopped working. The first one broke the same day as purchased. Replacement one broke on my vacation(Less then 90 days old). It is now on it's way back to Fuji for repair. I have nothing good to say about this camera. Wish I never bought the piece of sh**."
5,Spot the difference..,"Note how the reviews fall into two camps - the positive who have clearly read the book and the negative reviews by those who probably haven't.I have read this book and have only one criticism - the fly cover is really loose and I gave up with it in the end. I still looks nifty with it's gold on black lettering.The rest of the book is superb, a detailed, knowledgable expose of a quality comparable to Farrell, Sommers or Braver.Buy it, learn and ignore the screeching."
2,heterophobia:,"As a woman and as a feminist I am dissapointed at how we are misinterpreted. I do not understand where people are receiving there information from but it seems to be from unreliable source. Before anyone speaks about feminism, it would be helpful to take a class in Women's Studies to trully understand what a feminist is and what we are trying to achieve: equality. Because I am a feminist, does not mean that I am anti man! Even if I was anti-man, it is still my right to feel and think whatever I want. I will heal when I am ready. If there is to be real change, we need to stop attacking one another and cooperating so that all people are treated fairly."
5,Superb,"This book is like a breath of fresh air. With devastating precision, Patai sweeps away all the platitudes surrounding discussion of sexual harassment. She shows that due process is often deemed irrelevant after someone is accused of sexual harassment, that definitions of what constitutes ""unwelcome behavior"" are generally kept deliberately vague, that attempts to curb behavior are often fuelled by resentment and vindictiveness, and that the desire to control other people (put in motion by claims about power imbalances) is, at bottom, impossible to appease, let alone to achieve. The cure is far worse than the disease, as she usefully reminds us.Unfortunately, the very people who need to read this book will probably take one look at the title and run a mile. This is a real shame, because Patai's book is extremely thoughtful and deserves very careful consideration by men and women alike, whether pro- or antifeminist."
2,Better option available...,"I purchased the 992 to replace an older ATT business phone I had for 10 years because I needed the Called ID capability. The phone looks good but the big complaint is that the speaker phone sounds very ""tinny."" I ended up returning the phone and purchasing the more expensive 4-line model (ATT 974). It has more features (many of which I really don't need) but, more importantly, the speaker phone is clear and vibrant. I'd recommend the 974 instead of this model if you plan on using the speaker phone."
1,"Awful phone, dialing barely even works","I'd like to echo everything else said in these reviews: caller ID doesn't work, static, etc. I've also found that if you dial at a normal speed it confuses the tones and doesn't put the call through. It only works if you dial extremely slowly. I tried calling AT&T and they said they'd send a replacement. They never did."
3,It's fine so far. Except!,"The phones seem to work ok, like others have said, the dialing is a bit slow and all the beeping really sucks (mute, etc.). Would be nice if the back light did not stay on all the time, should just light when there is an incoming or outgoing call. This phone should have some of the features that AT&T's 4 line phones have (hold, paging, etc.) since they seem to not have a 2 line that does this. Speakerphone is pretty much useless in somewhat of a noisy enviroment, because background noise makes the caller cut in and out. For the price, not a bad phone, but could use some more attention by the manufacturer. Oh yeah, I am a bit picky cause I am a phone technician."
4,Description is wrong.,"The description states that A/C power is not necessary with a fresh 9V battery installed; this is incorrect. The 9V battery is used to keep the phone's memory intact (caller ID/time) if there is a power outage. Using just the 9V battery (which does get drained VERY quickly), you do not get the backlit screen or a few other features. Speaking of the backlight, its contrast cannot be adjusted, it is either on or off. Aside from everything previously mentioned, the sound quality is very good and all of the features work as described."
2,Poor Quality DVD Set -Good Program Content,"I really like this brief series, however the quality of the DVD's is quite poor, especially considering this series was not recorded all that long ago. To compare -I have a 7 year old Fawlty Towers VHS set that has better picture and sound quality (and that show is from the 1970's)!"
5,GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD READ....,This was a great book.... I loved the alpha-male and the Amazing Grace part got my heart pumping... oh my!
2,Not so appealing,"Story starts off bad, Not a great story line. Has a twist at end which is probably the best 4 pages of the entire book."
4,Good book,I enjoyed reading this book. I loved the main characters esp John. I also really loved the ending of the book.
2,Falls flat,"This was a much hyped book that falls flat. It starts off really good with great chemistry between the hero and heroine. But begins to steadly decline through the book. You find out he is an ex seal & she is a interior designer. The author in the next 25-30 pages takes you through attraction, dinner, sex and immediate regret on the heroines part. They did not even make it to a bed or for the night! It then skips to someone sneaking into her house to kill her. She calls hero instead of cop bestfriend. It goes down hill from there because you do not understand this change. She goes into hiding but we never know the reasoning until the last chapter. Where the hero allows her to go into protective custody against his wishes. Not worth full price! Book 2 is a step up for author. Skip this go straight too book 2. Mo you will not be lost! :)"
1,"An Excellent Cover, but...","The constant inclusion of the author's religious opinons dilutes the content and distracts any reader who may be interested in learning the storyteller's art. Any reader who indeed is interested in learning more about the reader's religous opinions would, of course, be delighted.All in all, the book would not be helpful to anyone other than a total beginner at storytelling and even for the beginner, there must be better sources.Paul Baum, Ph.D.Living Historyist"
1,"terrible, bad sounding, corny","The final death knell in my Van Halen fanaticism. I grew up loving this band, but with each susequent release, I realized how I had outgrown them and how they had lost their steam.First, the sound. This album sounds like it was recorded (porrly) in a studio and then a loop of a 500,000 person audience was played over it. Kiss Alive 1 was a more believable sounding live album.....and most of it wasn't live!! At not one point does it feel like there is any connection with the audience. This think makes Live Without a Net seem intimate.Second, Sammy. Oh, Sammy Sammy Sammy. You stink bro. Your between song banter is the most moronic I have ever heard. Your screams are forced and your lyrics stink.The guitar sound: Way too distorted. What the hell IS that crap? If any of you have ever heard the Pasadena 77 bootleg, you KNOW that this can't be the same band or guitar player. I don't care if it's 15 years later!!!In short, stay away"
4,great scope,"The scope is great. Mine is mounted on an RWS Model 48, .177. It maintains it's zero and has great glass for the money. The flashlight is a handy feature, although not as bright as I'd like. The laser is good for fixed distances only. The best thing the laser is for, is scaring the jeebers out of hiding birds and flushing them out.If you're not doing much night shooting just go with the regular scope."
5,BadAss Rifle scope!!!!,I use this scope on my custom crosman 1377c carbine. And it looks pretty badass LOL its really accurate and the flashlight and laser are a good plus too. The laser scares the hell out of people at night. I recommend it 5 stars for sure :D
3,Good for a 2d fighter but not that good,"I played a very similar game on the Dreamcast and it was virtually unchanged. I thought the worst part is that the game isn't even reformatted for the PSP's widescreen format, it is simply stretched from the original 4/3 format which is UNCCACCEPTABLE for a $40 game. Though a 2d fighter can be fun but alot of the ejoyment comes from playing with friends and since your chances of running into someone with the game are slim its a no go for me and i resold it."
4,30# Fiberglass bow,"This is for me (whimpy girl) and it is perfect. I am challenged by it, more used to a 20 lb bow, but I will enjoy working up to the challenge. It is great that it is set up for either right or left hand use, as I can share the experience with others!"
4,Titan Bow is worth the price,"This bow was purchased as a birthday gift and it was well received and it is very appreciated. The bow is light-weight, yet sturdy enough for a young man to use."
2,Making Money off History.,"Seen this movie this past saturday with my folks- and I must say it wasn't all that.Don't get me wrong-like everyone else I too feel this was a terrible event-but leaving the threatre I was a bit awed at a movie(of such importants in modern history) put out by Universle Studios looked like home vidio-and drunk& shaky camera man at the helm.The best part of this movie is that it is a lasting tribute too the 9/11 victems.So in a nut shell - The day starts out as any ordenery day @ the airport,and air traffic control.Until a scrambled radio message-and a missing plane beings too alert the powers that be there is a problem. More planes go missing.Adventually flight 93 passangers find out whats going on-and a hand full of passangers and sturtess revolt against there captors.You know the rest.One last thing -there seems too be alot finger pointing in this movie which I also think is wrong.again the best thing about this is the TRIBUTE TOO THE DEPARTED."
5,Wish I got it when I had my first born:),"I love this book:) I wish I have it when I had my first born although he is 5 now but I am encouraged to buy this book after noticing that my second child is strong will and stubborn than her brother, all my strategies with my eldest won't work on her so I desperately need help. Thank goodness with this book it saves my sanity! I like that you don't need to read it from the beginning to end instead you can just look at the topic you need, most likely work like a dictionary but with really useful advise and example. I highly recommend this book, a must for every mother or parents."
2,Ok - but not practical for any common cause,"It is a good book but is not practical for any blended family needs nor even for single family issues. These type of children are totally different than what a preschool teacher, Gail Reichlin, has pitched in her book. Even so, it would make a good gift for regular families for everyday craziness. I prefer other books when dealing with blended family issues..."
5,Pocket Parent,I have at least 20 books about two year olds. This book is so reader friendly. Excellent advice easily accessed. If I were only to limit myself to five this would be one of my five.
3,It could come in handy some day,"I thought it was good, it just wasn't what I thought I was looking for. I was looking for more help with the time-out knowledge but I am sure down the line and as my daughter gets older I will use this book often. I loved the section on Self esteem and how to help your child by rephrasing your words, could help so much in their self esteem. I am actually excited to use the methods in this book, I just don't need it right this minute."
2,Spend your money elsewhere,"This coffee table book has nice photos and is easy on the eyes, but if you're looking for a collection of striking photographs, you'd be better off with any of the wolf calendars. It also has numerous typos and rampant editorializing. For instance, it uses the generic man regularly, in places where it would be easy not to, and in the very first chapter manages to blame the wolf's endangered status on the spread of Christianity. The verbal descriptions of the wolf's prehistoric ancestors directly contradict the drawings given of the same ancestors. I don't know enough about wolves yet to judge the accuracy of the factual information presented, but when the rest of the editing and writing is so sloppy, why should we trust the factual research not to be equally sloppy?"
2,Dud,Work for about 20 minutes and than did not work again. I think it was a dud and would never purchase again.
1,very bad product,This new battery lasted for less than 30 days. Now it will not hold ANY charge whatsoever. I would not recommend this product.
3,"Changed my rating, up","Upon receiving, this battery would only charge to 80%. Now, about 4 months later it will not hold a charge at all. I requested a exchange or refund, and will see what happens......I was provided an exchange, and for the time being this new battery appears to be better. Not dropping to 80% immediately like the first one, and appears to hold a charge longer - about an hour. Not anywhere near the 3 - 4 hours I got from the Dell OEM battery, but this battery has a much lower cost so I expected it not to be as good."
2,not so funny,"I honestly had to force my self to laugh. he's a funny actor, but he isn't funny in this dvd."
5,This is a 10 billion star book!!!,"Never in my life have I read a book that is so utterly thought provoking. I fell in love with this book one summer day and it has been a long term love affair. Every heartache brings me to this book. Want to know how to survive a broken heart? Read Dufresne. Want to know that your grief, while painful, is not unique? Read Dufresne.When my grandfather passed away, after the hours of tear stained pillowcases, this book was the first thing I reached for. It's a warm blanket on a cold evening. I can not praise Mr. Dufresne enough for his amazing talent. I have never been disappointed in anything of his I have read."
4,Kool and the Gang are Cool,"This dvd has a good collection of songs of Kool and the Gang. It covers their career totally. Overall, the dvd is a good one to have, if you need Kool and the Gang in your collection, although the dvd is way too long."
1,Be warned!!!!,I have owned this camera for roughly a year and it has not live up to it hip or price tage. For the most part it is poorly built.Mine lasted as long as it did because it rarely or never worked as it should have. Save yourself the time and money.Be warned !!!
3,"Cheaply made, but you have no choice","There aren't many ""basic"" cameras out there for ""artsy"" photos. This one is not high tech at all, instead its made of plastic and has a plastic lens and manual feed. The color filters make it interesting but I question if it is worth the $70. Fun though, and being a part of the LoMo revolution is cool."
1,perfect for poseurs,"Two quiet revolutions in photography--the Lomo and Diana/Holga--added a new level on how artists view their work. Unfortunately, so many seem to think that by simple buying and using these devices, they will make instant art. Now a whole slew of cheap hunks of plastic sold at inflated prices are flooding the market, feasting upon this followers mentality.If you really want to experiment with color-flashing, buy color filters (or scavenge for random tinted transparent materials) and experiment on the flash of a decent camera--or if you are into plastic, then get a holga. This process will not only teach you so much more about what processes produce what effects, but you'll actually create something new, you'll be using a creative process. This thing is not a creative tool, it is an unimaginative $3 hunk of plastic being cleverly marketed and sold for an astonishing price that sucks any creative possibilities out of the user."
2,It's ok,"The tray is good, but I am trying to find a liner at home depot and the size of this tray doesn't have anything to fit it. So I just painted from the tray and throw it out after i'm done. The roller sucks so much. After using it for 3 mins, I just throw the whole thing out. Next time I will just go for better quality stuff."
2,A collection of useless information,"The title GPS for Land Surveyors is misleading. How GPS Works, would be more discriptive. I paid 75.00 for this book because I thought it would be instructive for using a GPS system for land surveying (based on the title). Instead it tells you everything about GPS, EXCEPT how to use it for land surveying. It talks about frequency, wave lengths, phase variance, time shifting, the ionosphere, and even Einstein's theory of relativity. Everything except how to use a GPS system to do land surveying. Even if you were interested in these technical aspects the short paragraphs are little more than interesting anecdotes. So IMHO this book is a collection of the technical minutiae of GPS, not necessary for land surveying using a GPS system."
5,A DEFFINATE MUST HAVE!!! OH SO SOOTHING TO LISTEN TO.,"This album is my most favorite of Dwight's work. My very first album of his I bought and it is terrific work. You have your georgeous slow songs, ""Home for Sale"", ""Two Doors Down"", ""Ain't That Lonely Yet"", ""Try Not To Look So Pretty"", then there's your down and fun, grinding, mover n shakers like ""A Thosand Miles From Nowhere"", ""Wild Ride"", and a person can't forget the popular ""Fast As You"". you definately deserved that GRAMMY!"
3,An Overview of Handgun Use For Self Defense,"This is a decent introduction to the use of handguns for self defense. It is just an introduction though.About half of the DVD is basic handgun safety and the balance has some rudimentary tactics for personal protection.Although the information is good, it could have been much better. The video is very short (about 45 minutes) and just does not have nearly as much information as I would like to see."
2,Chilton's,"I was disapointed in the lack of depth with the manual. There are too many sections where it says it's too complicated, take it to a dealer. I didn't buy it to take my repairs to the dealer!"
4,Good Advice,"This book is a good read for any girl. Even though it is a bit old fashioned, Andelin's advice has seemed to stand the test of time. I'm a healthy, attractive 21st century girl. As fearless, ambitious, and independant as can be. But I have had trouble holding on to a guy. Reluctantly, I tried to behave like ""the fascinating girl"" and, much to my surprise, it actually worked. Women have drastically changed, but I guess men aren't all that different now than they were 40 years ago! Keep this in mind, ladies."
3,It's a Giant,"I ordered this as a Christmas present for my husband. Looks to be exactly what he asked for, although I was shocked that the book was so big. I understand it has to be big to provide all the references, but I'm afraid it will be a little hard to handle because of size. Definitely a book he will have to study at home. Traveling with it would be extremely difficult. Still, I am happy with my purchase."
5,Great for anyone who wants in-depth Bible Study,"There are so many different ways this book can be helpful. It's great for anyone who wants to find a scripture passage but can only remember a few words from the passage or wants to compare how a certain word is used in different places in the Bible. You don't have to rely on a minister or other Bible scholar, you can find answers for yourself. I've found it most helpful when translating from Hebrew and Greek using the Hebrew and Greek dictionaries in the back. They actually make it possible to do some analysis of the Bible in the original languages without knowing Hebrew or Greek. I would recommend the exhaustive concordance over the concise one because there really isn't that much of a difference in price, and the exhaustive concordance has a lot more to offer. Of course, the concordance is based on the King James Version, but I've found that only really matters when you're using the concordance to help with translation."
1,Less than adequate.,"This, like Strong's Bible dictionary, is based on the KJV bible. Since the dictionary is abriged, his corcordance is too. Like the dictionary, this received 1 start because there is no 0 star rating."
5,"wonderful,A++++","easy read, would recommend this to everyone one,a big help on studying my bible,well worth the money ,buy it now!"
4,"""Let Me Love You This Way"" is your reason to buy this CD.","""Let Me Love You This Way"" is quite simply one of the most beautiful and touching ballads ever recorded. Based on the beauty, strength and elegance of most of this CD's songs (""Always You"", ""Any Kind Of Love"", ""Let Me Love You This Way"", ""A Baby's Born"") this album deserved to have done much better. It's just as incredible and mind-boggling that a singer as powerful and soulful as James Ingram never became the superstar he should have been."
4,Not at all bad!,"I don't understand why people dislike this album so much. It's not half as bad as people make out! I admit it isn't their best album, it's a lot more subdued than Technique and PCL, but if they'd done another Technique they'd have been slagged off for that. Regret is a fabulous dance-rock track, one of the best tracks they've done, Spooky is a great techno track, as is Chemical. The rest of the album is quite dark and gloomy, but there's nothing wrong with that every now and then. The versions of World and Ruined in a Day on the album are inferior to the mixes on the singles, but still good. I recommend this album to any New Order fan."
3,all,"great cd! if you are an eighties child like myself then you definately will kill for this one for the fact that the times then were so bisque that it hits you right there whenever you listen to music that reminds you of the times...and i'm not talkin' about any hiphop bull-sh-t...if you understand where i'm coming from. if i can actually find to box set...you guys remember that one...the box set-2 cd's in a black box...ahhhh that would be the ultimate of reminiscense...trust me. by the way, people also know me as candy...yeah MHS!"
4,So-so,"An oddly unbalanced album, 'Republic' contains some of the best singles New Order ever dead, and a lot of filler. Listening to it in order there's a huge dead patch of forgettable music between 'Ruined in a Day' and 'Special', which is a shame as the first three and last two songs are excellent (particularly the under-rated, almost ignored 'Special', and 'Avalanche', a suitable closer to their career, or, if they return, the bit of their career in which they weren't a nostalgia act). It's a shame that Stephen Hague's production, whilst fine in its own way, isn't very 'New Order' - apart from Bernard Sumner's voice, the rest of New Order seem to be absent (particularly Peter Hook's bass). Still, 'Regret' is possibly their finest single ever, and 'World' is a close second, and it's still a New Order album, if not a particularly consistent one."
5,Excellent Product,"Perfect addition to my K100DIt uses less battery life than the camera when in a pinch, I've been able to switch out the batteries to increase my camera's life while still being able to use the flash."
3,"Versatile, But Not Powerful","This flash is far better than the on-camera flash, in that it does extend the range a little, and adds an enormous amount of versatility and control over lighting the subjects. My problem is it's range - although it is a basic flash, I tried shooting subjects no more than 16ft away and it had problems lighting them up properly.At first I thought it was my camera or my partial inexperience in using flash photography, but then I allowed a friend to try it out on his, and he being one who has more experience than I, he found its range capability to be unexciting and disappointing. I have put mine up on EBay for sale, with the hopes to recoupe enough out of the sale to upgrade to the larger model, with the hopes it will do better for me."
1,I thought this was detestable!,"The entire DVD (after the nice young lady speaking for a few minutes) was a montage of graphic, explicit and horrific pictures, in technicolor, the effects from smoking. I quit myself just over a month ago, and these atrocious pictures burned into my brain almost have me lighting up once more from the sheer shock of it.Sorry, I just can't see the benefits of this DVD for quitting the nicotine habit."
2,GATE II REVIEW,"Not quite what we expected--however, it is playable. Tape has been subjected to magnetic field(s) at some time. Unusual amount of shelf dust which permeated the cassette itself, requiring inordinate time to recover.For the price and the availability, it was worth the price. We will lower our expectations next time for items of this genre and category."
3,OK,"It came as needed, but it was dirty and the box was dented a little. It seemed like it was on the shelf for a while. The inside was what we needed. The price tag led me to believe I did not get a good deal on this item."
3,good. . . but,"I bought this jewelry organizer about a year ago and have a couple things I would change. It definitely needs some kind of closure across each line of pockets, maybe a thin strip of velcro. I tried to fold it up to put it in my safe when I was going away and jewelry went everywhere, especially smaller items. Also, it would be very convenient if the hanger swiveled."
5,A Tray!,"I love this tray. I used it to serve greasey food at a brunch, and it was perfect. It has a kitchy vibe that people enjoyed. I bought them in various colors, which really suits my weird apartment."
4,Easy to Apply!,"I bought these for my mother who's primary language is English so she could type in Korean. Great deal, transparent and yellow ""Hangul"" made this super easy for her to see. The decals go on easy and this was a perfect solution for her. Would totally recommend this to anyone."
2,Winding Crown Came Off 1 Month from Purchase,"Wanted a Tag for years. Beautiful watch, nice weight, Winding Crown pulled off 1 month after I bought it. VERY Disappointed, had to send it in for repairs - expected wait time 8 weeks.Just reviewed the blue face version of this watch - same problem noted by one of the reviewers of that version of the watch. Hopefully my repair will be more prompt.Just got my watch back from warranty. Fixed, but will be cautious with this timepiece when adjusting."
4,School Law.,This book serviced its purpose in my School Law class. I loved how the format was in a question/answer format.
4,A Feast for the Eyes,"Contains beautiful illustrations, interesting recipes and meaningful Bible passages. Something from Bible times that we can use in the here and now."
5,Elementary My Dear Ed,"I love Christmas, like Ed Koch, New York, and mysteries, this is a wonderful blend. Read it, I wish he would make more."
1,What a mess!!!,What a mess of a record. The engineers at the studio must of accidently recorded the garbage truck outside picking up the trash. Because this is not music. It's garbage.
3,"Okay, but definitely not great","Review for Black and Decker 2 slice toaster (black).Toasters are so tricky! I don't want to spend a lot on one in case it's a dud, but I also don't want the cheapest one around. So, when we bought a new one last year, we settled on one that was in the middle of the road price range--this one.This one is okay. Just okay, not great, and not bad. It does take longer to toast, but if you're willing to wait, it does a good job (sometimes it may take two rounds of toasting though). It automatically stops working if the toaster has gotten too hot. Also, the toaster won't allow you to push it down if the toaster isn't plugged in. That can be a blessing, because you aren't going to come back to a piece of toast that you've pushed down in the toaster, but isn't done because it wasn't plugged in.I like it because it's dependable and it works! My husband frets because it takes too long. Hence, the 3 star rating.So, all in all, it's a decent toaster if you're not in a rush."
4,Goofy learning,It's an old book yet it does its best to try to teach you how to speak French when you're a native American-English speaker. So with this little guy you get a pretty good grasp of how you are to pronounce basic words and eventually you'll be able to almost speak French with no visible American accent.
2,Previous Hard Usage,"I usually buy very good or better quality. I would rate this book acceptable at best, at least two steps lower. It had numerous cracks in spine, cover was banged up around edges."
5,Super repair kit.,Lots of parts to repair small and medium sized zippers for garments and other items. Easy to use and good quality.
3,Zipper Kit,"The instructions were not sufficient for me to know how to correctly usethis product. I broke several of the zipper heads attempting to get them on.Detailed, step by step, instructions with visual aides need to be added to this product"
3,"Good for research, not for reading.","Dallek writes a very informative and thourough review on the highlights and nadirs of presidential terms. He points out how and why presidents were elected and what , if anything, they did to change America. This book serves a purpose as a reference, but not for political reading."
2,should be a website,"This book should be replaced by a website. Far more useful to job seekers, and perhaps even more lucrative to Weddle. Perhaps the only reason for the book is to target a readership that is unfamiliar with the Web.But for people who regularly use the Web for work or socialising, having a website that can have the latest data, and which is highly searchable, unlike a book, is far better."
2,Not so great,"I bought this toy for my son. It's a cute toy and he likes the noises, but the holes in the back where the speaker is were not cut out, so it's very hard to hear. I exchanged the original thinking it was just a defective one, but the second had the same issue. There is no volume control and no on/off switch. It says all the #'s in spanish but it's easy to see it's a cheaper toy. I wouldn't recommend to a friend, spend a little extra and get something a bit more well made."
1,Not a mp3 cd player,This is not a mp3 cd player. it has a aux jack that you can hook you mp3 player up to but it cannot play a mp3 cd. Do not buy this product.
3,Pretty Good 2 Hour Show,"I recently purchased this show and I though it was pretty good.It has been called the worst WWE PPV ever but I beg to differ.The 1st hour was admiditely all junk:Bulldog and Owen vs LOD had a sucky ending,Rocky-Savio was bad but pretty funny looking back years ater,and Jesse Jammess-Rockbilly is horrible but falls under the Savio-Rocky match of funny to look back on.The 2nd hour,however,rules.Mankind and Undertaker fight for Taker's WWE Title and the Main Event sees Steve Austin taking on Bret Hart in a rematch from Wrestlemania.Also you get Sultan-Flash Funk from the Free-For-All."
3,"Good, no great","Sophie Milman is talented but I guess I expected a little more. I prefer a little ""edge"" like a Renee Olstead or Elaine Elias."
5,The must have collection is here,"Pour Some Sugar on Me- #1 on Billboard's Hot 100 SinglesHysteria, Love Bites, Let's Get Rocked, Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad all reached the top ten on Billboard's Hot 100 singles. Rocket, Animal, Rock of Ages, Two Steps Behind, Miss You in a Heartbeat and Work It Out show that Def Leppard is one of the best bands in history.#1 albums with Adrenalize, Hysteria and Slang.Def Leppard has stood the test of time and is one of the best British metal bands around.I'm still waiting for a new studio album from Def Leppard and I hope that it will be released soon.Def Leppard has released the definitive collection!!"
3,"New fan, great addition to any rock collection","Just picked up this album. Not very ethused at first, but the tracks have grown on me a lot since the first listen. Definitely worth the investment."
3,Not great but not bad,I am a nostalgic and was looking forward to listening to some songs that I grew up with. There are great songs in this set but find myself having to skip through one or two songs at a time to get to the songs that I really want to hear. It is a 2-disc set that should have been done with 1 disc.
3,"Drunks, taxes and gangsters","Not bad DVD, could have gone a bit more in to the why's of the taxes etc.Also agood spin of would be a history of todays brand names, Real McCoy, Jim Beam etc."
1,Horrible,"Bought a sensor, had a problem, contacted them on amazon - no response, contacted them on their website - no response (and there is no phone # on their website), I am a used car dealer, I am buying parts on the Internet every day from sensors and brakes to engines and transmissions, I had some problems with different shops before, of course, but Everything could be resolved with communication. With acdelco - there is no communication, they simply ignore you if you have a problem. Will never buy from them again."
3,"Nice story, awful pictures!","What is the criteria for a Caldecott winner? I see nothing in the illustrations of this book to deserve an award. The story is nice, but I don't get it as far as the illustrations are concerned."
4,Great pictures,"These pictures are very detailed. The illustrater must have been very creative to make pictures like these! The pictures are very interesting to see. I like how the illustrater scriblild in some spots to make the shades. This is a very good book for pre-schoolers,kindergardners,and first graders. They would love the colors!"
1,"Lifeless Anime, awesome Manga.","It's story is Okay, but so lifelessly acted that I actually fell asleep watching it. I don't recommend buying it, but I do recomend reading the Manga... it is much more interesting than listening and watching though half closed eyes... this Anime Video contains some of the most uninspired voice talent I have ever heard (Dubbed and Subtitled versions) and the most lackluster animation of any Robotech or Macross series. Again read the Manga, and skip the Anime."
3,"Great idea, not so well implemented","If you plan to use this center channel mounted on top of your flat screen TV (lcd/plasma) then you will certainly need the TV to be mounted on the wall. I have an LCD on a stand and attached this speaker to the top of of it like it's designed for (I plan to mount the LCD later). The speaker won't stay attached with the flimsy velcro that comes with it. I bought new velcro, same result. It actually fell off the LCD backwards the first night I hooked it up, like 1 minute after I installed it. It dented the screen and they replaced it, thankfully, but that's because it was a local vendor and I have spent lots of money with them. Now I'm searching for something else."
4,Hearts of Palm Review,I think that the product is very good for being in a can. We are used to a jar...but..thank you.
5,just right for fritters,"Fresh , clean product. Makes outstanding swamp cabbage fritters. Cut up the hearts, boil them until very soft, cool, mix in crumbled almost done bacon, finely choped bacon, couple of eggs, sices (salt, pepper, garlic, touch of cumin ) mix all together with some flour til formable, hot well oiled pan , get a little crust on them , EAT!!! mild tasty and awesome. I create a little sauce like a little mayo and horseradish or duck sauce with hot musted. Whatever your taste!!! They have a festival in Labelle , FL. every year and people come from all over the country to sample these little gems, they all cant be wrong. Wow your friends !!! Just get it on amazon. Good product, fast delivery, good price and very hard to fine this product in larger cans anywhere else."
1,Author needs a history lesson,Wow! this book was so off course both in the time period in which it's set and the daily life details that I wonder how it got published. Really bad folks! Louis Lamour at least got his medical and historical facts right. Cindy - do a little research next time please!
2,Don't buy it on a kindle,"This book might be good in the paper format, but it's terrible to navigate on a kindle. The answer key is so small it hurts your eyes, and cannot be adjusted with the font settings.Also, constantly having to scroll back and forth between exercise and answer key is exhausting. The author also launches right into exercises without giving you the vocab first, and expects conjugations from exercise 1.4! I bought this book because the Spanish edition was so good, but I'd skip this one."
3,The making of the micro:a history of the computer,"This book had a lot to do with math and calculators. It was verry interesting to see how hard it was to add without using a calculator. Some things that are taken for grantedare using email now. If you think about it computersrun on 1s and 0s. Just to say ""17' and not even display it the computer reads 10001. Letters are more complex to desplay. Some times it takes millinos of 1s and 0s. This is a great book for people interested in computers."
3,Nitty-Gritty Nonsense,"(Present perfect tense) Today, I have danced. WRONG(Past perfect tense) Yesterday, I had danced. WRONGBill HAS PAINTED the kitchen hot pink. WRONG....(present perfect)He HAD EATEN sauerkraut before he kissed her. WRONG....(past perfect)..........................(past)Does ""not-serious"" mean ""not even correct""? This is disgraceful. Someone should tell these two authors that you can't make a past tense verb into a present perfect verb by putting 'have' in front of it and you can't make a past tense verb into a past perfect verb by putting 'had' in front of it. ""Call me a taxi. OK, you're a taxi."" Can you believe that 14 otherwise-reasonable people wrote 5-star reviews for a book that includes this idiocy? Don't buy this nonsense even if you have money to burn. If you want an explanation and want to take it off-line, write to me at br dot hadvines at yahoo dot com. That's my real name up there."
5,An excellent performance,"This is a great album. The first half of it gives you the live solo acoustic Neil Young experience. Then the Stray Gators (Neil's band for the Harvest ans Harvest Moon albums) come out and play with him. Of course, this album showcases Neil's uses of hammer-ons and pull-offs while he is playing chords, and the unique voice of his harmonica, two things that define what Neil Young is. Sure, he's been nicknamed ""the Godfather of Grunge,"" but he has a soft side as well, and this is it."
3,Content Great but the product skips,"I would like to give this product a great review but the disc malfunctioned. It skipped every 30 seconds or so. I could not hear important information because of this. I plan to return the DVD to get another one. The content of the DVD is very interesting so I would like to hear ALL of it. After I have a better disc, then I will feel better about rating the product."
4,A Good Book,"Thought that this book was great. I think a lot of people would enjoy it. It is full of adventure and I couldn't put the whole series down! If you read this book, you will definatly think it is great!"
4,Wonderful,"This book made a great ending to the series, but it could have been longer. I guess it's a good length for a third grader, or possibly a fourth or fifth grader, but after that it's too short."
5,Churchill books always excellent,Continuation of his multi volume history of World War II based on his own records and files. Gripping.two more words required. Here they are.
2,I'm not so sure about this TV...,"I bought the TV from Best Buy for $200 a couple of weeks ago, and I've spent hours fiddling with the controls trying to get the picture to look right. Either it's fuzzy, or blurry, or just down right bizarre-looking - boy, do some people on TV look weird through this TV. And the sound is very tinny. My old TV was a 19"" Sony Trinitron I bought in the mid-80s, so I'm used to a decent picture, with decent sound quality. I should've saved up another $75 and bought a good TV. I think Toshiba and Panasonic both had nice 27"" flat-screen TVs for about $275. But I'm so cheap. Well, you get what you pay for."
5,Healing Deck,I use this deck for solemn occasions -- when a more physical and spiritual Healing Inspiration is sought. There is something about this deck which I find inspires reverence for Life.This deck is available in two sizes and I prefer the smaller deck because the cards fit very comfortably in the palm of my hand.The two authors of the book are also the two illustrators of these cards--half each; and I am able to read the drawings of one illustrator (one half of the deck) more easily than the other.
4,Good Price,"I love the asparagus but there is a few woody pieces in it. I have had the same with non organic tips and pieces as well, so I do not blame the product. I think my next purchase will be for the whole spears. I love the organic selection of products on Amazon, so many that are not available locally."
5,Best Moccasins,"The Moosehide Moccasins are superb feel, perfect in size and fit! I am tempted to get another pair.."
1,Minnetonka Moc Advertised as EEE,"Men's Minnetonka Moccasins Moosehide Moc, NATURAL, 9.5EEThis is the description I relied on for ordering. But when they got there they were clearly marked 9.5 W. As anyone knows who wears a EEE tryin to stuff that into 99% of the W's is a futile experience. It was no different with these Mocs. I really loved the way they look and felt. But I had foot hanging over both sides of the sole.I must say it was a pleasure working with The Cowboy Store who filled the order (and had to responsibility for the bad advertising). They sent me an RMA tag and refunded my money promptly. All with just an email."
1,A bunch of B-S,"-- I would like to know how this seller can justify a double in price between a size 9.5 and a size 10 both M width. The reviews kinda tell the story here since most people have said that the shoe runs a bit small but ALL shoes, no matter what your size is, will be a bit snug when brand new and especially with moc's. They Will stretch and conform to your foot. Unless of course you Really don't know what size you wear. I bought the 9.5 med which is my size and saved myself $35.00 where as the 10's sell for $70.00. I didn't know that the extra amount of leather needed between sizes was so expensive. What a Bunch of B.S."
2,Did Not Last,I expected to get more life out of these. They got wet and went downhill fast. Not good for extra wide feet.
1,"Not for Jazz fans, real jazz fans anyway","I'm not trying make value judgements here, but I just want you to know what your getting. To me, this is not the Hollan who did Conference with the Bird's and Duo's w/ Sam Rivers, all amazing and clasic stuff. As for this, I would say, if you listen to it while driving a BMW, you will probably like it. If you like less glossy and (to my ears) superfical modern jazz (not really jazz, the drummer is LAME), such as roscoe mitchell, Kieth Jarrett, jason Moran, etc, you won't want this album at all! The music really lacks depth and daring. It might make good backgroud for some. I say, don't encourage jazz to go so commercial. We have enough contentless commodities out there. Let's make room for and recognize some real indiviudalty and creaitivity (listen to roscoe Mitchell's Nine to Get Ready, or Jarrett's Inside Out, for instance)."
2,The adapter tip broke after less than three months.,"The adapter worked fine at first, but after a few weeks the adapter could charge the battery only when I placed the tip in certain positions. After weeks of trying to get the tip in the right position to make it work, it finally broke off after less than three months use. Genuine Adapters, the seller I bought the adapter from, doesn't seem to be honoring its warranty on the adapter as it has failed to contact me after I sent the company an email about the adapter two days ago."
3,It works,"It's been plugged in since I got it and it works fine. Seems the price could be less for what it is, but they are all too high."
2,NOT original,"Picture and description describes an original hp adaptor, its a cheap knock off. Had I known I would have bought one locally the same day, but instead waited a weekend and payed priority shipping for a knock off."
2,Not the best reference ever made for the Relms,This assessory details the Moonshae isles. This would be useful if your campaign was Druid or Ranger based. Some useful info about the creatures of the islands and the people trying to settle it.
3,"Quiet Basic, Mainly Arabic Names","It included mainly Arabic muslim names, while many are arabic non-muslim names but which the author fails to see and points out that all muslim names should be arabic. I do not believe that as some of the worst enemies of islams were arabs and had arabic names, so having an arabic names doesnt always mean it is a good islamic name."
2,Not very efficient,Overall very dissapointed with this purchase. The strips don't bond with the wax and there was not enough sternght to pull the hairs effectively. I am not sure why other people gave high rating for this product. Do not recommend it.
4,I'll recommend it; better than I remember it,"According to the Martin Celmins biography Green only had one of his wheels on the ground for much of the recording during this period. Intended to be Claptonesque but Green always managed to make things bluer. Vocals are wayward and inconsistent at times, but I really enjoyed spinning this. Side one was always a very edgy set in the best Greeny manner, even if his brother wrote the lyrics. But the rather breezy second side is sounding better than I remember when I liked my music edgier. Green's guitar leads had gotten very elliptical but he still had a nice pace and attack. Excellent rhythm section, particularly Fairport drummer Dave Mattacks, and a nice production job by Vernon-Kell and company. It was the third and last of the Vernon-Kells and I'm glad he took the trouble."
3,Good for kids.,"The game is fun but my kids finished in 2 days, Very repetitive, arcade mode, no improvement for wii.You should try for a better opcion. Like Mario Galaxy or something like that."
3,WHY NO CLASSIC CONTROLLER!!!! UGH.,Forcing Motion to throw the bombs is stupid. It wouldn't be an issue if they included Classic controler support. I can't even use my arcade stick with this game because it doesn't support the classic controller.Only option is to buy the games of the VC service which is stupid considering I already have this collection.God I wish they could do a simple patch.I also heard the PS2 version has a control lag and bad loading.
1,Not so good . . .,"This was received as a Christmas gift, and was a disappointment. After following the spartan instructions, we cranked the lantern for 5-6 minutes. We powered up the unit and the LED's dimmed to half brightness after less than one minute. The lights at half brightness stayed lit for quite a while, but half brightness is just too dim to be usable.I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."
1,Light doesn't last,I have to agree with the reviewer who said the light dimmed after a minute. I have a crank flashlight in the car that will stay bright LONG after this one goes dark. Buy this only if you want to continually crank it whenever you want to see at night. This is a terrible product.
2,BAD CRANK AND SWITCH DESIGN,This product is ok for emergency back-up when it works. Twice I have returned this product because the crank keeps breaking. You are to crank it for one minute to get its full charge. Twice I have cranked the handle and something broke inside. So after the charge went down you can't get it to charge anymore. I took it back and got my money back. My advice to anyone who uses this light is to have a good light for a back-up. Its unknown how long the crank will last before it lets you down and won't be able to have lite. Both of mine broke within no more than four cranks and had to return them. They are a great idea and nice to have. They just last to long.
4,Major Improvement!,"To this day, I still cannot understand why Michael McDonald is so underrated, and this CD is proof of that. The slow tunes, I will admit, leave a little to be desired; too sleep-inducing. But the one exception is ""Hey Girl"", one beautiful song that doesn't give Michael the credit he deserves. I've heard this remake by several other artists and not even Billy Joel can match up to him and his outstanding voice. Other powerful songs are the title track, ""Blink of An Eye"" with great guitar and ""Everlasting"" with an awesome gospel sound. Again, why this album has been ignored by the public is beyond me...I can only attribute it to the ""dumbening up"" of America whereby everyone just seems to be attracted by looks and fashion, not talent. But I give ""Blink of An Eye"" almost my fullest recommendation (I say `almost' because I would skip over the slow tracks) to true McDonald fans who will realize immediately it is a positive step up from his last 2 CDs."
4,Panasonic BL C131 Camera,"I have used all the features except FTP and http for picture transfer. I bought it to keep an eye on my home from anywhere. CONS: Silver color makes it very visible. Fast moving people are blurs and the timing of the pictures may miss someone walking by fast. Instruction are hard to read, not good english, has many parameters that can be tuned but his is also a PRO. PROS: It is as advertized and works just about out of the box for wired applications. It is not a surveillance camera and is not sold as one, but it does a great job otherwise. The wireless application took a little more effort to get it working, but it works great. I would not have bought it except for the free server service which is easy to implement. If you want to view an area remotely, control the camera via the web, have automated emails sent to you even on certain cell phones (did not check out), have good still picture quality, and don;t want to pay a lot of money, this is a good bet."
4,"Great product, is looking to purchase another one.","I read tons of review before I purchased this camera. I even looked at the linksys and D-link. At last, thank you for all the wonderful review on Amazon, I decided on the Panasonic. I've had it for 8 weeks, and it's been working great. No problem, and technical support help me through the whole setup. I bought this mainly to watch my son and nanny while at work. I can pan, tilt, and take pictures. It's a wonderful product. The only negative I would have is the resolution when you zoom in. It's not as clear, yet, for my purpose, it does the job. I'm happy with the camera so far."
1,JUNK,"Panasonic BL-C131A Network Camera Wireless 802.11This camera is junk, after approximately 2 years dead not working, 2 of them both dead. Do not buy this, I would suggest a Foscam for $85, if it goes dead the lost is minimized the quality is about the same."
5,Excellent Camera,"Setting up for local access is a snap -- remote access setup was a struggle but, jumping thru firewalls and routers is always a chore. I have to port forward past two routers and firewalls, but I finally got it working. Be sure to set the camera up to self restart once a day. Everything works perfect now."
5,Great product and excellent service,These people have the best service that I've encountered in years. I bought this webcam to use with Weather Underground. The instructions to set it up were a little bit over my head. I called them and within just a few minutes I was talking to someone in Virginia who was easy to understand. They guided me through as far as I could go at that point. A second call got me completely set up. At about six months I had a viewing problem and the red light on the unit was flashing. I was instructed to send it to their service center. I sent it expecting it back in about a month. I received it back the following Friday (a week later) and it is working fine. In my opinion they have a fine product and excellent service. I would never hesitate about buying another one of their products.
2,Poor Performance,"Poor instructions for accessing over the internet. Various, unconnected instructions that show you different procedures, none that work."
2,Great - while it worked,"I've bought two of these units over the passed 12 months. Both have failed within that time frame. I figured the first one was a fluke, which failed after about 3 months of use, so I bought another one. That one failed within a month's time. It was very easy to set up and get running, but I just wish it would have kept running - esp. for the price it's listed."
2,not impressed for the money I paid,i thought this book would be well worth the 30 dollars I paid. When I opened it up it was like I was reading a book for students in the 8th grade and not worth the amount of money I spent.
5,Great Way to Store Tools!!!,"I purchased one of these bags at a traditional bricks and mortar store, and it has been great! I neatly keep all of my tools, hardware, etc neatly stored in my tool bag at the bottom of my coat closet. Whenever I have a little project, I know exactly where I can find all of the tools, and can easily move them to wherever I am working. Plus, this bag is made very heavy duty, so I don't have to worry about it breaking anytime soon.I recommend this tool bag for every homeowner!"
1,sizing is misleading,"rating clarification: 1* for product page, 5* for actual product""center to center spread"" apparently refers to the full length of the handle. NOT the distance between the centers of the holes, as every other drawer pull in existence is measured. O_oit's a beautiful product and would have looked great, but the specs are totally off. time to go box up the return..."
4,Relax!,Alina is like listening to water. It obliterates all other sounds and events. I find it one of the most relaxing pieces of music I own. I rarely listen to the entire CD without falling asleep!
4,Great Game,"Dont believe the negative reviews that this game received in the Video Game magazines and websites. Hydro Thunder is a fast paced Boat Racing game loaded with short cuts and power ups. The levels are challenging. The gameplay is fast paced and will have you coming back for more and more. The graphics are not the best you have ever seen on the playstation but they dont take away from the gameplay. THe sounds, when cranked up on a stereo are great and real add to the feel of the game. Buy this one....its worth it!"
3,Hydro Thunder,I had been wanting this game for sometime but didn't want to pay the high price...This game took me less than 2 weeks to finish. The graphic are good and the boats are cool but rather hard to control at first...
4,Great Workout,"I really liked this video workout, but you have to get the first Cardio Party mix with the moves explanation. I had bought the first dvd of ""5 Rockin Workouts"" and had it for several years before I really got into it. Its a great workout, but takes a while to get the moves before you actually feel like you know what you are doing."
3,Vines complete expository dictionary,"The book is just so, so. It was not as complete as I had wanted it to be. A lot of words are not in this book. I wish the Greek spelling had been first then the meaning. But it references the Greek spelling in the back. Makes it harder if you are trying to use mainly the greek word and not the english, but are looking for the english translation for each word."
3,gymmom,"The instrumental that is also used for a car commercial is not on here. You are looking for ""Weapon of Choice"" by Fat Boy slim. Go to MP3 downloads"
1,Not Interesting,The book won't help you at all if you are looking to open a company. It is a long an uninteresting story of this guy's life.
1,deep folk,"If ""deep blues"" exists, then we may talk about ""deep folk"", this cd is very dense, it is only for collectionists of music from Portugal (like me)."
3,nice materials,i had a bad experience with another sony mouse but this one has have a good performance to be refurbished
4,fullness yes,"This product does give you fullness and is comfortable enough to wear, but I would like to let you know, if you are buying this to fit into the push-up pocket in your bra, than this one is way too big. This pad is like adding a second bottom to your breasts, so it sits against your skin in the lower part of your bra. If you sweat and move about a lot, this product can move into unnatural positions."
1,False Advertising,"This book was listed as new which is completely false advertising on the part of International Books. It arrived with no book jacket and writing on the top and side edges of the pages. Also a child's name was written in large print inside the book on the title page. The cover was marred with indentations, which would not have mattered if there had been a book jacket. How can this company possibly list this as a new book? I will definitely not trust this listing again with an order. I also question Amazon.com's judgment in carrying their business.Sincerely,An extremely disappoint bibliophile"
1,"IT DOESN'T SHINE, IT SUCKS!!!!","WHEN THE PRODUCT ARRIVED IT HAS ONE SOLAR PANEL HINGE BROKED. REPAIRED ITWITH HOT GLUE. CHECKED TO MAKE SURE THAT NO WIRES WERE BROKEN. THEY WEREN'T. PLACED BOTH UNITS IN DIRECT SUNLIGHT. AFTER SUPPOSSEDLY CHARGING FOR FOUR DAY'S. THEY STILL DID NOT COME ON IN THE EVENING. NEEDLES TO SAY, IN MY OPINION THESE ARE NOTHING MORE THAN MORE JUNK FROM CHINA AND I WOULD NOT EVEN THINK OF RECOMMENDING THEM TO ANYONE ELSE. THE HASTLE IS NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE IN TRYING TO RETURN THEM. SO, THIS LESSON ONLY COST ME $35.00.FOOL ME ONCE, SHAME ON YOU, FOOL ME TWICE, SHAME ON ME. SO, NOT BEING ONE TO SHAME THEMSELVES, MY BUSINESS GOES ELSEWHERE."
5,Excellent introduction to Sufism,"This is an insightful book on Sufism, not an academic analysis of Sufism as in the case of many books by University professors..Whatever may be the authenticity of Shah as a Sufi master[about which several articles have been written] his book is great...it leads you into an appreciation of Sufi methods which are not easy to understand....Since it is a mystical path,words and literary accounts and books can provide only an indirect approach to it.Much depends on one's practice...I had been influenced by a Sufi master in India who is not alive....I can relate better to Shah's book because this master used similar methods and inspired others....Therefore, commenting on this book purely from the aspect of information and literary style is not correct....I wish we have more Sufi masters who can write like Shah ,whatever may be the tradition or linealogy [Silsila] of such a master."
4,Good but not his best,"This is a CD that should be in most people's collection. If you can't have all of the earlier albums then this is a good sample. However as with any Greatest Hits CD's this one has some good stuff on it and some okay stuff on it. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that it is missing some of the songs that more define TJW than some of these. Songs like ""For Le Anne"" or ""The Father"" or his great version of Dylan's ""Copper Kettle"". I was surprised that the title track, and one of his few instrumentals, ""Home Made Ice Cream"" did not make the cut. That song is not only short but as TJW as you can get.If you like his older material, especially the quieter songs, then check out his last 3-4 CD's which find him in a more mellow form."
1,don't waste your money!!!,"it's incredibly boring. it's just a repetition of moves to get through each level. spare yourselves and your money. and trust me, i've tried many times to get into the game but it simply isn't possible. don't buy this game. i'm warning you. beware of the contents..."
2,This book is for absolute novices,"I just paid over $100 for this book and I was disappointed. Over 100 of the 300 pages of the guide are simply a glorified advertisement and screen prints (filler) from what the authors call the ""big 4"" vacation rental websites. There were a few useful tips that I got from the last two chapters of the book, but it is not worth the price. This book may help you if you have never rented a house before, and you are new to the internet, otherwise, it is much too basic to be useful."
2,Find another one,"The item arrived in about a week and well packed. The cable is thin and not best quality and is hard plastic. Had difficulty bending it. After connecting the PC monitor and TV, the brightness reduced on my monitor and the TV iage was dull. i have to disconnect the PC monitor every time I need to watch videos on the TV. I would choose to get a HDMI PCI card next time and recommend the same if you were looking to connect PC to TV.Hope this helped."
4,Did what i needed,This did what i needed i needed to split the VGA output from my security camera DVR to my living room projector and the monitor in the closet by the system. i don't see any goasting or shadows. if your looking for something that will work this will do it but but there are better splitters out there. also make sure your source has the ability to drive two monitors. if it doesn't a powered splitter is a better option for your needs.
3,Same display output to 2 monitors,"The price I bought was 1 penny plus $2.95 S/H. Other deals are like $2.95 each with free shipping... I think they are the same product. It work OK but not all pins are connected so when the PC is off the monitor behaves as it's not connected. My monitor would show ""Self Test Feature Check"" instead of turn off automatically as when it's connected directly to the PC. I don't mind to pay more for it but I can't tell which isn't the same as this one."
2,Resulted in video quality loss,"This Y-cable turned out to be useless for me. When both my monitor and TV are connected, there's quality loss on both. If I unplug one from the Y cable, the other works fine. I don't know if another Y cable might avoid the problem, but this one didn't work for my case."
2,"Cable, VGA Y, HD15 Male To HD15 Female","If your looking to use this to have duel monitor use, make sure you have the right VGA card. The product is good to go if your using it to share the same screen with a projector."
5,freedom crossing yes or no,Freedom Crossing was a great book. Laura was so out there and cool. I read the book for a report and loved it. Its definently a book I'll keep reading over and over again. I would recomend it to people who dont like to read because its the type of book you cant put down.
2,16 years of changes,"I have a '94 pickup, but most of the information and pictures were of much earlier models. Since it covers 17 model years of pickups and 9 model years of the Pathfinder, it can say very little about each."
1,terrible quality,Buyer Beware You get what you pay for. Tons of lint balls in the washer and enough lint in the lint trap in the dryer to make a whole new set of sheets!! Sent them back with the prepaid shipping label because if I used them and washed them again they would have disintegrated!
1,I would NOT buy these again,"I am getting ready to throw these away and chalk it up to money wasted. I bought three sets 1 King, 1 Full and 1 Twin. They are all shedding lint horribly to the point that one of my white mattress covers is now blue. The dryer us full of lint with every wash, and the lint sticks in my hair. What a horrible waste of money and I am in search of new sheets."
2,Sheds like a mangy dog...,"These sheets are definitely warm and comfy - no complaints there - but they shed thousands of little balls of flannel. Made the mistake of washing a couple of other items in the same load - spent hours picking dark blue flannel off the other cloth. After the first washing, the surface is no longer smooth, but ""pilled"". At this rate, they'll be down to bare threads after another couple of washings (and they'll have to be alone in the washer for each of them!)In short, although this is an amazing price for a flannel sheet set, the quality is such that I would not buy it again, nor can I recommend it."
2,sheets,i was pretty disappointed with these sheets because the first time i washed them they got little fuzzies all over them.
4,Too thin,"I like these sheets, but the first time I washed them my lint dryer was overflowing and it tore a whole the first time I put them on the bed. Other than that, they are soft."
1,Half of these sheets were left in my lint trap,"These are by far the worst sheets I have ever purchased. My lint trap was filled over the top after I washed these. The sheets themselves were totally covered in pills. I had to wash them six times before they were acceptable to even put on a bed and each time my lint trap was overflowing. I was surprised after all of it that the only thing left wasn't the stiching. Oh yeah, that fall apart too and I had to sew the sheets before I even put them on the bed for the first time. Not worth the cost of shipping let alone the price to buy them. DO NOT BUY THESE CRAPPY SHEETS."
4,"comfy, but lots of lint!","These sheets are really cozy and warming, however when you dry them they produce tons of lint/pilling!"
1,Horrible product,Product not even worth a penny. Impossible to use after the first wash..Wont recommend to anyone
4,I almost didn't buy these....,"because so many of the reviews were so negative. But, at this price, I went ahead and tried the king set in pastel blue. I washed them and used them and I have to say I really think they are an incredible bargain. They do pill a little and create some lint, but my older $110 flannel king set pills much, much worse (I am constantly vacuming dark blue fuzz from my bedroom rug when I use the more expensive sheets). The flannel is thinner on these than on my other set, but they're soft and warm and cozy. I'm getting another set!"
4,very soft and fluffy!,"I was delighted with how these felt when they came out of the dryer and eager to put them on my daughters' beds. They are fantastic, the girls are happy with them. The only problem I've found is that the twin size seems to be rather big and fits very loosely on the bed."
1,You get what you pay for,"I bought two sets of these sheets @ 14.99 a piece. You get what you pay for. I bought the forest green and navy blue sheets and there must be a quality control issue here. Some people have said that their sheets didn't ""pill"" too much, but mine came out of the dryer with 2/3 the thickness gone. The rest of the sheets collected in my lint trap and when I took them out to see the condition of the sheets, I was shocked. The elastic came out of the stitching, there were loose threads everywhere and my hallway was a mess with green balls all over the place.At a list price of $50 for queen size sheets, It's no wonder why they are ""on sale"". I have never been disappointed with Amazon, but I am now...I'll just stick to buying CD's and movies from now on. Lesson learned....but seriously, a product this bad should NOT be sold by Amazon."
2,"Pike Street Solid Flannel Queen Sheet Set, Navy Blue","Enormous amounts of fiber pillings from sheets before and even after several washings. The pillings would never end. I liked the color and the feel of the sheets, but cannot stand the constant fiber droppings on my pj's and all over my carpets! I will never buy the ""Pike Street"" brand again."
1,These are the worst sheets ever.......,I have only used these once and just from rolling over these sheets tore. Poor quality Do not buy them . Especially if you are using them for a tempur-pedic.
2,I don't care for flannel sheets after all,"They are warm, however, after a while of use, they just start balling up into little balls of fuzz and fall all over the place, the little balls get on everything! I was NOT going to wash those in my washer and clog up the machine, I ended up throwing them out, I don't like flannel sheets!"
1,Not worrth it.......,"I have bought flannel sheets from Amazon before but they were from Martex and they were greate. But, these are just bad. They are too thin to start with, left lint all over the bed and even after washing they have left fuzzies all over the sheets, I cannot even explain how bad it is. I should have waited for another Martex deal."
1,Do not buy,"I agree with most of the other reviewers out there for this brand of flannel sheet. Do not waste your money. These sheets become translucent after a couple of washings, and the lost material needs to be scooped out of the dryer's lint trap by the handful. The seams on the pillowcase have also come apart. Poorest of poor quality."
4,An in depth recreation of ancient Germanic culture,"The book drew me in with its descriptions and dramatisations of ancient Germanic culture. The mixture of mundane politics and the otherworld inhabited by gods and dragons reflected, for me, the mind set of the ancient Germans. For a person wanting to know what it felt like to live in the 5th Century CE, this is a good historical fiction novel.The hardback edition is a beautiful book, worth searching for."
3,Derek Jarman in book form,"If you can't get enough of Jarmen's films, you may love this book. It's hodgepodge: half autobiography/half manifesto. It reminds me of much output by ACT-UP and Q Nation members. (I guess it's called Outrage! in Britain.) Because the West has become less AIDS-phobic and gay-friendly, this book may feel incredibly dated. Because it is true to life, parts may make you uncomfortable. For example, Jarmen retells how he rejected a man once and I felt soooo bad for the guy. This book also mentions public lice, black and white female impersonators fighting and other stuff. This is not easy reading. Still, for those who love Paul Monette, Tony Kushner, Robert Ferro, or their kind, this will be a book that you may want to have or read."
2,Loose controls.,"The ice maker is very much like the one I had to replace. My old one was from china and could not get it repaired. The new one has already started having trouble. The controls on the front keep coming loose from the cabinet. This is a pain. But I quess replacement parts again are not available. ""CHINA"" Word be taken."
5,awesome pay-per-view.bret hart and undertaker were awesome.,"this ppv was awesome.first with mick foley and hhh.the really put on a show.especially when mankind jumped off the cage,which was an awesome moment.then stone cold and owen hart.the famous i broke your neck accident that happened.stone cold won but the roll locked kinda fake and the fans could tell they were kinda actinbut it was stil a great match.bret hart vs undertaker.it first begins with bret hart comin out and singing that dum canada song which was borin.the macth was awesome.the really put on a show of how a match should be done.that was kool how shawn micheals hit unndertaker with the chair and gave bret hart the victory.awesome ppv i recommend it"
2,Horrible,"This doesn't even sharpen! It actually ate the pencil and when I tried to put the eyeliner on, I got a sliver of wood in my eye!"
1,PLEASE DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT,"IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SATA - SCSI CONVERTER PLEASE FORGET ABOUT THIS OPTION, PINS ON SATA CONNECTOR BROKE AT FIRST CONECTION ATTEMPT.WEAK PRODUCT AT A HIGH PRICE.TRY SOME OTHER OPTIONS."
4,"Interesting, well-written, and enlightening","Crosby takes on a very difficult and complicated subject here and manages a book of remarkable clarity and balance. The book is lightly written and though the footnotes were a bit distracting (I'd have preferred they be set out in an appendix) it's a fast, friendly read. I would recommend it to readers with a wide range of interests from general world or medieval European history, to those interested in the roots of western business practices, music history and notation, physics, astronomy, mathematics . . . Bravo, Mr. Crosby!"
4,Great Surprise Pick,"My somewhat random choice of this book from the library (I judged it --favorably--by its cover) turned out to be a great pick. This gripping, well-written story provides a fantastic alternative to the chaff one normally finds in the genre. In fact, Requiem transcends easy classification, as do many great stories. Joyce handles the protagonist's descent into madness in clear, convincing and chilling fashion. Heartily recommended for those seeking an imaginative tale"
4,Great Purchase,I recieved the correct book. And it was in good condition. No complaints would purchase from the seller again.
4,Very COOL dub,"Kind of ambient.Excelent tracks by DJ krush, Stryke and Boozoo Bajou.Nice voice from Bacuzzi.To listen at night with a ROHN."
4,Great Book and Great Reference,"If you are wanting information on the Faery Faith of the TDD Celtic Coven.... this is an EXCELLENT book!There is a background on the coven that is short and VERY informative!If you are looking for information concerning the most popular or better known God/desses, there is a wonderful chapter that give the associations for them. That section alone is worth the price of the book!The rest of the book is all of the holiday rituals and it is very good! I was so impressed! As well as the death, hand fasting... etc....ALL of the rituals are wonderful! They are complete! I like that!This is a wonderful book."
4,A pretty good sampler of Spanish Horror.,"I bought the set on the strength of ""Specter"", with the incomparable Juan Jose Ballesta, and ""Blame,"" which I had rented previously. All six films are good, but those two remain my favorites. Strong acting and directing all throughout."
3,Fuel Tank Station 15 Gallon,This is a nice tank to carry additional fuel in the back of your truck if you're heading into the unknown. I found it to be very useful in my journeys into the desert. The one and only real draw back is the tank had lots of slag left inside after the welding was finished. I had to take a magnet and sweep the bottom of the tank several times to get the majority of it out.
4,Good storage option,"Got this to fuel my generator and so wife didn't have to lift heavy jugs of gas. Fuel cap was dinged on one side when I got it, must have been crushed from rolling around inside of box loose. Called customer service and I had a new one in the mail in under a week, no charge. I mounted this on a pair of heavy duty brackets that both of the warehouse hardware stores carry. Had to drill holes to match the holes on the legs of the tank. Brackets are mounted to 2x4 studs inside wall of shed. Make sure you mount it real close to door, as the hose is not all that long and barely reaches outside the shed. I use a step ladder to fill this tank using my portable 5 gallon jugs. Only con is capacity. Directions say to only put 14 gallons in it to allow for expansion. It is advertised as a 15 gallon tank."
2,"weak band, lousy compass, no backlight, fails too much","I bought 2 T-Touch watches, one for my husband and one for myself. They are wonderful pieces, with very cool functions, if they worked, like someone said in another comment. My husband's has failed twice already, once the compass ceased working and now it stopped altogether. Obviously it does not resist water not even to wash your hands which is absurd for this type of watch. Mine has worked fine (but with minimum use) but the rubber strap (worth $115 to replace) just snapped off the watch and you could see the very thin rubber it had to hold itself on to the watch. The absence of such a simple thing as a backlight bothers me a lot, in the dark the watch is useless! Definitely too expensive for the quality. Not worth the Tissot name (I have other impeccable Tissot watches)."
1,don't touch the T-touch,"I have 2 T-touches, one I bought on Ebay and one my son gave me for a birthday (he didn't know I already had one). The first one died after swimming, it was fixed under warranty by the Ebay seller, the compass doesn't work. The 2nd one also died, the dealer said that water was the problem, prior to dying, the compass also stopped working. Too bad.. I might just buy a cheaper Swatch."
3,"Part of the ""Mageverse"" series by Angela Knight","It was okay.... Ms. Knight has written so many books that are really, really good that it was hard for me not to be disappointed by this one. I expect so much more from a novel written by Angela Knight. This was just fluff...."
5,Excellent Product if Properly Applied,"I have been using this product for many years and have been very happy with the results. Toppik works effectively if you have enough hair and apply the powder (fibers) properly. If you are bald, this is not a good option. If you have thinning hair or have had a hair transplant, Toppik can make a big difference in your appearance. I recommend applying a moderate amount to your hair and combing the fibers through your thinning area. Follow up with a light application for touch up and spray with a mist of hair spray or Aloe Vera Juice. Use a mirror to view the top of your head to make sure it looks natural."
1,Laundry Hooks,My daughter had me buy these for her due to her use of ones that my wife uses in the laundry room. My advice is that if you are not using them for hanging pictures in a dark room you should look elsewhere. Very flimsy and cheaply made.
1,disappointment about item,"I would love to review Sacred Love Songs, but it never arrived. I received another DVD that had nothing to do with the title. I had to pay return shipping which was not reimbused--although the original purchase price and shipping were. It was an expensive exercise I regret---I had to pay shipping for something I returned. What a rip-off. I won't use your other merchants again. Very disappointed."
3,The Seven's Great; The Philosophy's Not,"What a great idea for a book! Goodrich sometimes is a fine and even thrilling writer. His description of his first drive in the sports car he built was so perfect I read it twice. But as my college philosophy professor Gresham Riley once said, ""Don't conduct your philosophical education in public!"" The bulk of the book is philosophy and history mixed together about cars. That would be OK if the analysis was as insightful and incisive as Goodrich's description of why bolts stick to nuts. But it's not. Still, Goodrich's all-too-brief mentions of building the Seven are so good that you have to order and read the book."
2,"Lots of 'angst', little 'roadster'","I purchased this book based on glowing reviews here and elsewhere, and must admit extreme disappointment. This is not a book about assembling a car, it is a book about an intellectual's struggle with middle age interspersed with occasional comments about putting the car together (which was depressingly uneventful). Had it been marketed more as a essay on how vehicles have changed our lives and interesting tidbits of history, I probably wouldn't be so hard on it. I was looking for another ""Truck"" by John Jerome, and I was misled that this was it. Roadster isn't a bad book, it's just not for the pure car guy who only cares about fixing and building them and doesn't give a hoot about societal issues. Get ""Truck"" if zen isn't your thing."
4,bought used ..got a deal..and found sufficient,"I just wanted to let viewers know about this amp..long story short..for 120watts the amp does the job I had it driving a 12"" blaupunkt Pro Series (300 watt rms) in a ported box. Honestly the amp did what it was supposed to do but just wasnt powerful enough for me. Now , I use it on 3way Pioneer 6x9's OMG! They scream SOOOO loud. This amp is more suited for mid range but for awhile it pumped that 12 pretty good. All in all its just like all Kenwood ive dealt with affordable, dependable and of nice quality."
4,WHOA Is this good!,They are great. This is only the second album I have of theirs and I love them. will be sure to buy more.
4,Very nice album...so soothing and smooth,"Jazz turns many off but this album is smooth and allows a person to stay awake, in the groove and also feel energized at once...go Chaka"
5,Flowing and intriguing full of suspense and knowledge,"I bought the book in 1984. I passed it out to friends then forgot about it. In the 1990s, I started looking for the book and never found it again. I am disapointed that it will not be published. It would be a winner again. I could not put the book down. I skipped the amourous parts and jumped to the scientific aspects. It was better than the Van Adriken books eg Chariots of the God. I believe in the theory and wish the scientists would study this HAB theory a little more. Too bad we do not have Carl Sagan anymore. It would have been to find out from him what he thought of this theory."
5,"Finely-crafted, sobering story","Although this is not the usual Allan Eckert story based on early American history, it is nonetheless an excellent, captivating tale that grabs the reader instantly. I read the book two years ago (in 1997, a library copy), and cannot dismiss the ""theory"" from my mind. Mr. Eckert expertly tells how the earth has gone through various Ice Ages, and how we could have another Ice Age-soon. Once you start reading it, you can't put it down, and you can't forget it. I would love to have my own copy to read again. It's time to publish it again."
5,The HAB Theory,"Excellent service regarding this purchase, you had sent me a review on this purchase earlier and due to the timing I may not have given it a positive review. The review you sent (earlier) was only three days after I had purchased the book and didn't allow enough time for the book to get to me. The seller immeadiatley contacted me and emailed me and was very helpful. I will do business with her in the future and was very please with her professionalism and concern.Best RegardsDaniel Williams"
4,WHAT OTHER SAMPLES THE BEAT FROM,"I bought this cd thinking that the ""murder she wrote song"" was the song I heard at a club but it wasnt!!!! can anyone tell me who sings the remix or who else samples the beat from the ""murder she wrote"" song? all I know that in the song that Im looking for it says ""movin',I like the way ur movin' ,the sexy things ur doing, u cant take ur eyes off me"" I think that what is says....can anyone please let me know who sings it and where can I purchase that song!!!! hit me up [...]"
3,Good for the price,"I agree with the buyer who said ""You get what you pay for."" We had to buy a spring frame to attach to support the mattress. It would have been great if this had come with the frame to begin with. The knobs are nice and heavy, but the ""gold"" plastic tops are not strong enough. One of ours cracked as we were gently tapping the knob into place. Do be gentle when you put the knobs in, since they will crack easily."
4,hello,i thought this game was good. it was a little hard like the last leva is way to hard and there are a couple of leval where you dont get a gun.but overall this game is good to any one that likes actiongames on the gameboy
1,Worst AC I've ever Used,Do not buy this Air Conditioner. This machine does not get my 10'x10' room below 79 degrees. I've already installed the machine and had to spend cab fair to get the machine to may apartment. At this point it's pointless to bring it back as the packaging is destroyed and the cab fair is expensive. Do not buy this machine!
1,My kid is lost with this book,"I purchased this book for my 9 year old who is in the 4th grade. He has played in a couple of chess tournaments through is school and gets As and Bs in school.However, he expressed great disapointment when I purchased this book for him after he spend two days on it. Therefore, I look at it in detail and found my poor son had been reading a very poorly written book, that as an adult I found poorly organized and certainly a book with moderatly difficult concepts poorly explained.Stay away from this!"
1,Oh I must agree!!!!!!,"Daa! It has been pointed out that the author forgot to cover how to checkmate with a Queen and King against a lone King when this is a book for the beginner. And, after reading some other books on the endgame I decided why not warn all of those who might buy this book and then be very upset that this book is disorganized and written in a way that it doesn't know what it is talking (writting) about. I my only be 10 (yeas old) but this books gets a 1."
5,Beethoven Piano Trios - Beaux Arts,Top notch recording at a bargain basement price.I hitherto knew only the Archduke. The rest are really worth getting to know.
1,This Book Could Save You a Bundle on Prescription Sleep Medication,"I agree with the ""No Doz"" reviewer. Agroecology need charismatic promotion, not a plow-speed lecture on soil chemistry. This book, likes its author, should be put to pasture."
5,"ten good pens , delivered, for one dollar and sixty-nine cents","Ten good pens that write very well, in a translucent blue housing, delivered via UPS for one dollar and sixty-nine cents with Amazon Prime."
4,Better than the original,"Along with several other customer reviewers, I have no idea which book Publisher's World was reading when they wrote the review for The Emerald Cavern. The very things PW complained about made this book more enjoyable for me. With the power available to the main character, is it a surprise that he would be drawn into political intrigues?The character development in this second novel of the series is both realistic and in-depth. Mathew's transformation from akward teenager into manhood is believable and touching. The characters in this novel are actually likeable! I know this is a step backward from more recent popular fantasy, but I found it charming. There is also plenty of action, so get a copy and dig in!"
1,don't buy this item!,"I ordered 3 of these and received only the head fixture, Part # 007. . without the projector Part #008FP, as listed in the description. . on every other website I looked at each part sells for around $51. I made 3 phone calls to Lamps Plus and was assured I would hear from someone, which I didn't. .on my final phone call, I was finally issued an order number for the missing parts but was told the Amazon page is wrong and the projector was supposed to be an additional option - they say they are going to change the Amazon page. . . I ordered to coincide timing with my electrician for a pre-thanksgiving install. . .which will now not happen. . ."
3,The movie contains only interviews,"It's all interviews, no footage of riding at all, except by chance in the background once or twice: it's interviews from start to finish. The interviews are on-site at various competition venues -- hill climb, trials competition, hare and scramble, supermoto, etc. -- with both little-known people in the world of competition and well known or even legendary riders. Although the interviewer (off camera) generally poses fairly bland questions, many of the interviewees do quite well and are interesting and engaging. If the film were billed as ""all interviews,"" it *might* deserve another rating star, but because the cover art, cover text, and studio description will lead potential viewers to expect mostly action footage, it probably deserves one less star."
2,Another bad album,"This album is really bad, dont waste your money. The music and the vocals are terrible. Check their first 4 albums and especially Danzig 2 which is a good album"
5,the best danzig album since 4,"yes, this is the best danzig album since 4. the album from begining to end is amazing, and the best song is the last""black angel, white angle. yes the verse vocal on skin carver is too low, but the song is amazing! as the album goes on the songs are more intense. these are the darkest danzig lyrics ever. i have been a fan since the first album and i love them all, 4 has stood out the most over the years, but i have been listening to this album from beginning to end since it came out and i still can't take it out of my cd player. like every band, the old fans will never get what they want, they always have something negitive to say because they want the band to just write the same album, danzig does not do that. this album is amazing and don't nit pick it apart,you will lose out on the experiance."
2,Good pictures (not great) / bad binding - falls apart.,"I bought this book brand new from Amazon because I wanted to see some nice pictures of the French hillsides and landscapes. The pictures are good (not great), but as soon as I started flipping through the pages, I noticed that they started to come off the spine like those cheapo postcard books you get at the swapmeet or tourist traps.Don't waste your money on this book (like I did). I bought mine brand new, but because they used an inexpensive binding method, it'll always fall apart as soon as you open it wide to look at what you think are supposed to be 'great' pictures of Provence. The pictures are just OK - in my opinion. It's a small book, so it doesn't really do justice to those pictures (if they were really that great in the first place)."
2,Some good photos but terrible binding,I should have paid more attention to reviews of this book. The first time I opened the book the cover peeled away from the binding. There are some good photos but not much in the way of narrative.Provence: 500 Photos
1,Great read,"Five Stars- If you have ever carried a rifle or a shotgun into the woods this is a book for you. As a young man I read all the articles I could find on hunting in Africa. It was a dream of mine to hunt Afirica for big game, but that particular dream would never come true. This book told what it was like even down to the bugs and snakes. It was wonderful. I turned around and reread it after I finished it the first time. Fantastic!"
3,Great idea but needs to clip on better,"I like the idea of having the grass on the water fountain. You don't have to water it that way. I was kind of wondering if the clip would keep it in place when my cat ate the grass. As I suspected, she pulled it right off. Using an adhesive to stick it on the side might work better. I just used velcro to stick it in place."
3,Left a slimy film,I only bought this once. My cat seemed to love it and ate the grass as soon as it sprouted but the plant itself seemed to leave a slimy film in the fountain along all the walls. I had to throw away the filter and I never used the product again.
3,Good but cats didn't use it!,Although the quality and shipping and everything was great and timely. My cats just didn't like this at all. It gunked up the fountain and they didn't eat it or bother to even mess with it so we just threw it away. It's a good product if your cats get use out of it.
3,"cute idea , but dont bother","grass grows quickly and its cool at first, but with no sun, eventually molds, roots invade the bowl,and my cats didnt catch on to it.... pfft"
5,Grew so quick!,This was a wonderful product except it didn't fit the water fountain quite the way it should have. (my fault) My cat didn't understand it... so I just clip it and give it to my guinea pig on occasion. :D
1,Still looking for help,with the hairball/throwing up issue. I have two medium haired cats who bathe themselves constantly and go through spouts of throwing up hairballs. I have tried different foods and misc items that claim to help with cats natural digestion and hairball assistance/control. Although my cats loved to chew on the grass it only changed the throwing up from hairballs to grass.I have since quit using this product.
1,enought materiel but does not help you get fluid whit it,"this book is not good for students that are going to be tested on the material and the reson is you have no way of knowing if the solutions found for the problems are correct or not, now this may not be important for sombody who's only seeking some extra knowledg. however for students hwo are going to be tested on the materiel, this book may not be convinient. when solving problems one may feel like shooting in the dark....."
5,Loved it.,"Laura Reese doesn't fail from her first novel. Once again, beautifully described, almost overly described in some areas of the book. She takes you through a journey of murder and lies. With the main character and a brother, sister duo, there is a constant question of ""what happened"", ""who did it"" and ""what is going on with the sister/brotherly love"". Again, the author dives even further into what is known as very ""taboo"". A perfect read for anyone who enjoys this genre of literature."
3,"Okay, but not the best.","This is a pretty mediocre CD. A couple songs get a little laborious, but overall it was okay. I got this after getting HoHoHoey and liking it. I was curious to hear what his original stuff was like. The only real problem I have with it is that Gary kind of sounds like a cheap Joe Satriani knock off. A few of his riffs are tired and bland, and Motown Fever just seems like he's trying a little hard to expand his musical styles. But its a very noble effort indeed, I will give him that. The high points the album are ""Hocus Pocus,"" ""Texas Son,"" the slide intro to ""Deep South Cafe,"" and the very very nice acoustic stylings on ""Jamie."" I really suggest trying Joe Satriani first if you havent already. Try Surfing With The Alien or Anthology, and I would also try HoHoHoey, cause its really nice to have around the holidays when people tell you to put on some holiday music and you dont want to put on any traditional junk."
5,For those who hate...,"Question: Have you really listened to the lyrics? I mean sure, you dont get a lot of boom bang biz-oww, but these are really deep and often humorous songs.Own it, love it, you should buy it!"
2,miguided medical chapter,"I work in this field (vet ophthalmology) and when an animal goes blind I no longer recommend this book to my clients, after reading the chapter on medical diseases. Even though the rest of the book is good.A significant amount of information contained in this chapter is misguiding, erroneous and not back-up by scientific, peer-reviewed, data. It gives owners false hope in some cases, and that is not acceptable to me."
5,good information,"Our dog recently went blind, she's 11, so I got this book to see if I could make life easier for her.It was very helpful. Plus it explained in great depth,what could have caused it.I'm glad there was a book out there that dealt with this subject"
5,LIVING WITH BLIND DOGS,THE BOOK OFFERED MANY TIPS ON HOW TO DEAL WITH MY DOG WHO HAS ALSO BEEN DEAF FROM BIRTH. I WAS AT A LOST ON HOW TO HELP HIM AND NOW I FEEL I CAN MANAGE HIS LIFE MUCH BETTER.
1,Very upset with techniques,"I bought this book as a gift for my sister who just acquired a rescue blind puppy.I'm a positive dog trainer and was disgusted that a prong collar could be suggested for any dog, let alone a traumatised blind dog! These are illegal in Australia. I couldn't believe my eyes and had to re-read it, as I thought I must have read it wrong. And to say that this method is not as harsh as some others, the mind boggles to think what these alternatives are! To suggest a water spray for blind and deaf dogs is just disgusting. These are both cruel methods which are just so unnesessary, when the desired behaviors could be achieved by gentle kind methods.How very disapointing."
4,Good cross section from Los Lobos,"This is my first CD from Los Lobos. I had listened to a number of their CDs before deciding on ""Just another band from East L.A. The reason I chose this CD was because it seemed to contain most of their best tracks and demonstrated the diversity of musical genres that this band is obviously very adept at. I also really like the sound of David Hidalgo whose voice features on many of the songs. Overall I'm very pleased with the purchase and one day I hope to be able to see the band live (tricky from Australia) I'll have to keep my fingers crossed on that one."
4,"Good Stuff, but......","My knowledge about Los Lobos was pretty limited when I bought this. I like the CD but I don't find the R&B, rockin' tunes as compelling as the Mexican music. Those tracks are why I give this compilation 4 stars."
2,Disappointing,"The Spanish songs are awesome - the rest are your average Top 40, indescript / inert / lifeless / as seen on TV / out of the meat grinder songs (or rather, collections of sounds). My advice: don't bother - just get La Pystola y el corazon and whatever else they have in Spanish. That is the good stuff."
4,inexpensive,"good disposable bolts. I use them to kill vermin, so if I lose the bolt, no big deal. Use the aluminum ones for bigger animals, or if you need to bolt to be a true shot. These plastic ones have a significant degree of error in grouping in a controlled environment. 40 - 50 ft. the shots vary by about 6 - 8 inches. aluminum ones stray about 2 - 4 inches."
4,Why ignored by the masses?,"The Kinks had a strong comeback (mostly in the states) from 1979 with ""Low Budget"" that lasted a couple of years. I dont know why that popularity declined after 1983 when they did records like this. Its a very strong pop/rock-album with solid, corefull songs (with a few exceptions). I think it reached nr 115 on Billboard. Maybe that effected Ray Davies selfconfidence badly because the next (and maybe the last) Kinksalbum (""Phobia"" 1993) was the worst they ever did. Just boring routine with no insperation (with a few exceptions). Then it took him 13 years to come back with an album with new songs (""Other peoples lives"" 2006). But its not too late for all of you who missed it out back then to do youself, and The Kinks, a favour and discover this pearl."
5,"A great gift, of if you're a grinder nut...","I have two of these. One has the original Himalayan salt still in it, and the other now has Hawaiian black salt in it. Hey, there are times when it's fun not to know which of the black spots on your eggs or mashed potatoes is salt and which is pepper! The grinder is a bargain, and Himalayan salt? Well, what other salt has THAT many extra nutrients! This makes a lovely gift for others, or for yourself. Go on. Give yourself a really nice present. You deserve it!"
5,Give this book a chance,"I know you want to protect your little one form hurtful sayings, but when they are ready to learn the lessons of respect and kindness; when they are learning about empathy, read them this book. Each of us can be callous at times, but we can turn it around and become a better person if we ask for forgiveness when we have been hurtful. Good conversation starter about bullying, too."
5,Great read,"This is a wonderful tale of romance and espionage against a regency backdrop. If you like this period, it's a must read. I loved it."
5,Page turning excitement,"If you don't enjoy Oliver Stone because you're hung up on the historical inaccuricies, this is not the book for you. But if you love a good adventure with a strong female character, excitement, drama, mystery, all at a fast past, get this book! I have never, ever pre-ordered a book before, but I did preorded Samantha Saxon's next book. Too many of the books coming out today are not exciting, too concerned about telling us just the exact hue of the daisies or being the written version of the history channel, or worse yet, no development of characters whatsoever because the author is afraid of being inaccurate, etc. Samantha Saxon was a delightful find that'll keep you guessing."
2,Bought based on other reviews but disappointed!,"Wildly improbable plot further weakened by author's poor grasp of the history of the period and misuse of British aristocratic titles (editor should have corrected these problems but was apparently AWOL throughout). I can only think sex scenes redeemed above problems for other reviewers. Don't waste your money. Try books by Mary Balogh, Eloisa James, and Julia Quinn instead."
1,Save your money or buy a book,It was cool seeing how Chewbacca looks like but thats about it.It really stinks.
4,"A little boring, but still interesting","Being a true Star Wars fan, I bought this on a whim. And a whim is pretty much what this video is. If you go in with no expectations, like I did, you will probably enjoy it--especially if you are a Star Wars fan. If you aren't, don't buy it... it really doesn't have much to interest non-fans. There was a lot of talking, fascinating to me and others like me, but brain-cell killing for those unlike me. Are you a right-brain or left-brain person? Think carefully before buying."
3,Good Plain Fun (and a workout),"This is the same track & field game from the mid-80s, with better graphics. Controls are simple; just press the buttons as fast as you can. Not as fun when you play by yourself (actually, it's pretty depressing), but the fun factor multiplies 10 fold when competing against friends. A great party game. Tension rises once you start breaking records. And yes, it can give your hands a workout."
3,A bad but good game,This game is very porley made with ugly opening screens I didn't like it at all so I suggest you don't buy this game
4,Return to form,"Best offering from Pompougnac for a while. Bright, flowing urban sounds. After having enjoyed the series to no. 5, I was somewhat disappointed with 6 and very much so with 7. Consequently, I nearly didn't bother with 8, convinced that the rot had set in. But I'm glad I took a chance on this one."
1,need some handkerchief,"We all knew that Costes' spirit faded away about the 4th volume. Anyway we didn't miss unity in other opus. Tracklistings were varied and elegant. #7 lost rang, and #8 make you feel sick.Tracks by Tosca (good Heidi Bruehl despite it's been compiled in lots of places), Mark Farina and Parov Stelar remain to mythical moments of ""La Suite (#2)"" and ""Etage Trois (#3)"".Mixing is bad and when it's good a pc mixed what the ""Dj"" could not mix (we are inured to Pompougnac's works) and you can perfectly guess where the cut of a track is.Brazilian dreadful tunes (Zuco 103), hip hop for old snobs who can't throw their Jazzanova café-music CDs (Smooth) and music for nappy TV ads (Flying Pop's).What about Htel Costes 60?"
5,Excellent product,This product gives an excellent shine and strength to your hair. It is slightly expensive but worth every penny. I would recommend this product to everyone.
4,An adventure that just keeps going,"This book takes you on a adventure that is thrilling and a imagination getter. You have to get into the books, but once you have there is nothing stopping you, exempt when there is not a next book out yet, that is why I rated it a four. I can not wait for the next book to take me on another adventure."
1,AWFUL,"This wig looks NOTHING like the picture! I ordered it for halloween to go with my flapper costume. I tried it on and it was downright frightening. How disappointing. It looks raggedy and unkept, no amount of brushing helped. The back is poofy and it looked like I stuck a bowl on my head and wacked off chunks of hair around it. HIDEOUS is the only word to describe this wig."
5,THESE GAMES ARE AWESOME!!!!,In Tiberian Sun You can do really cool things like defend a UFO and in Tiberian Sun firestorm you can get awesome units like cyborg reapers in renegade is a first and third person shooter and red alert 2 you can use awesome stuff in yuris revenge you can mind control massively! In conclusion GET THIS!!!!
4,Interesting...,"The information given here is now available in other, more recent books but I marvel at the fact that this book was written in 1989! The information given some 20 years ago is even more appropriate today! The authors (Figgie International) supposedly wrote a companion volume ""for the individual"", but I can't find it. I don't own a business, so some of the information in this book doesn't really apply to my needs. I do recommend this little volume for anyone who is interested in learning more about hyperinflation and its affects on business. Remember - that which affects business, affects consumers."
1,Disappointing.,"If you are looking for a book to give you some indepth knowledge of the homosexual agenda and its dangers, this is NOT the book to get. Floyd is obviously seeking to make a few bucks off the valid concerns of Christians and conservatives and has done so with a book that offers no new info and certainly no depth to the discussion. His is not even a satisfactory survey review of the issues. Where others, such as Fr. Rueda's The Homosexual Network, Sears and Osten's The Homosexual Agenda, Chris Wolfe's Homosexuality and American Public Life, Legislating Immorality by Grant and Horne, and Jeffrey Satinover's Homosexuality and the Politics of Truth, offer insights into this dangerous movement, Floyd's was a waste of time and money."
4,Awesome Game!,"Worms Armaggadeon is just a MUST have action packed game, You gotta Get it , it is SOOOOO SWEET!"
1,a horable game,this game reeks.it is a slow moving flatout boring game.the most I would pay for it is 5 bucks.Whoever gets this game has prorobly played James Bond or Perfect Dark.Those are much better action packed games.
5,"Funky politics, nostalgia, poetry, and commentary","What a great disc. Although I can't say that I agree with ALL that she runs down. But I definitely concur with the vast majority of the knowlege she expounds.But make no mistake about it... this album is not for the status quo. Despite the great musicianship, and raw honesty only those with some sense of the experience of the artist will be able to appreciate either the lyrics or music without becoming unnerved.Shootin up and Gettin High and Step into the Projects are the outstanding cuts in my estimation.A definite purchase!"
2,Buy the Hawhee book,"Having read both, I'd strongly recommend the Hawhee book over this volume. It's an unpleasant fact (made plain by taking a Transcender exam or any other good exam simulator) that learning this material is going to take serious time -- this isn't an MCSE elective, this is the dense and complicated (albeit interesting) core of the MCSD certification. The Hawhee book is excellent and, while on the one hand it takes a good bit of time to go through, it is exhaustive and (using the time it requires to best advantage) trains you for both the 176 and 175 exam simultaneously."
2,Too basic for the exam....,"I bought this book a month ago, and I failed. It is too basic for the exam and does not have enough details. Especially, distrubuted applications and deploying an application parts are really insufficient. I would not rely on this book if I were a candidate."
4,Good for a Visual C++ programmer,"I have all the books in this series and give all the books 4 stars. Apart from the odd typo here and there, the books are well presented.Exams 70-016 and 70-175 are relatively simple if you are a Visual C++ programmer who has only used Visual Basic as a test harness. The content of the Training Kits covers 80% of any exam (VC++ exams too) and was enough for me (just) pass them. If you also read the 'orange' books, you will get 100% for the VB exams.'Desktop Applications for Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 MCSD Training Kit''Distributed Applications for Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 MCSD Training Kit''Programming Components With Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0''Programming Distributed Applications With COM and Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0' books."
1,A Huge Disapointment ( There is Nothing Lower than 1 Star),"I work with VB, I bought this book to help me pass exam 70-176. I was shocked that the ""Microsoft Official Curriculum"" would be so brief. I said what the heck it's the ""Microsoft Official Curriculum"", they can't be wrong. MS Press has always been so good, they can't go wrong, well they did!! Big Time. I took the exam and was shocked that there was so much emphasis on Deployment and Installation (some thing I don't work too much with). A roll of the dice is more help with the questions than this book."
2,Not recommended,There are a number of factual errors that are unacceptable in any sort of official curriculum (you *can* call an event procedure if there are arguments to it; there is no Description property to a menu). Code examples or screen shots sometimes did not match the text. I have yet to find a good book that really covers the exam.
5,IT the most amazing ever,it all sticks too one subject... it's all great. if sum41 wanted they could make all their songs on this c-d singles.
5,FUNtastic guitarist!,"In April 2006, Greg Koch was the opening act for Joe Bonamassa on his Netherlands' tour. He showed great humour in his songs and wicked guitar playing too. He's a character! If you like the guitar, check one of his cd's out!"
2,Screemin' through the subberbs @25mph in an alpha romeo?YUK!,"THis is a lousey game. there isn't too much else to say about it. The only reason it didn't get 1 star is for it's decent graphics, but that's about it. The cars are slow, the music 'bites', and what the hell is a wey hey anyway!? And who's idea was it to call this street racing? This game consists of alpha romeos, opels, and saabs driving at slow speeds during the day time with lame am radio going. I'm sorry. That's just not what street racing is all about. If you want real street racing, get tokyo xtreme racer! And if you are getting tired of this game's slow moving cars, then play mario kart. Those cars are alot faster."
5,I can't stop playing this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If anyone is interested in buying a race car driving game,you should definitely get this one.Once you beat like every level you get all forty cars.You also get to to race in cities like San Francisco,London,and Tokyo.It has great gameplay except for turning.You can still turn great but you should always put the brakes on if your going to turn a lot in a course.Great graphics.Everyone should get this game immediately!!!!!!!!!!"
1,BORRIIINGGG!!,"Hello I'm writing this review to tell you what a bad game this is. Starting with the title.... Metropolis STREET RACER. By that you'd think you'd actually be racing, but no your just goin through hours and hours of TESTS!! Yes i said tests. And then finally after 3 hourse youre finally finished. so u get the car, right? WRONG!! you have to get under a certain time to get the stinkin car!! my final thing is just dont waste ur time/money buying such a dumb game instead get tokyo extreme racer 1 or 2 they are a lot better with a lot better graphics !"
4,Great car tales,"More compelling a book than I had expected. Would think the tale would become repetitive, but surprisingly not so. Different writers and styles help to mix it up. Fun before and after photos. A good book for incremental reading; falling asleep in bed, during morning constitutional. Helps, that my first car came out of a barn."
3,Cobra in the Barn,"Interesting, just too many short stories, it becams boreing after a while. sorry, but that's how I see it. Thanks"
3,Interesting But A Little Repetitive,The stories are interesting and fairly will written but they tend to blend together after awhile. It isn't the type of book I'd want to pull off the shelf later so I'm glad I got the e-edition for my Kindle.
2,out ot date info,"This book gave a lot of the early history of Days of Our Lives, but nothing from about 1995 forward."
5,Worms Eat My Garbage,Time to start living sustainably and stop talking about it!Landfills do not biodegrade waste!This book helps you biodegrade your own food scraps by creating a worm paradise. I feel like I now have livestock that grazes on my old vegetable and fruit leftovers. The book is simple and complete. Highly recommended!
4,Gilligans 2nd and 3rd seasons,Gilligans is a classic. The movies were delivered on time at a good price with no issues.
3,Helpful hints indeed!,"This book is surprisingly fun. You name it and this book has a tip on the most effective way to do it. I bought this book in conjunction with two other home maintenance and repair books and it has many items that were not covered in the other two. I only gave it three stars because I will probably only refer to this one after the other two to verify that there isn't an easier way. What would make this book better? I say combine this book with their ""New Fix-It-Yourself Manual"" (my top choice), and you have an ace book!"
3,No melodies!,"This would get 5 out of 5 stars if it had the melody given with each song. Only the chords are given above the lyrics. Because I only know a few melodies of the MANY, MANY songs in the book, I must search for recordings and learn the melodies by ear. On the plus side, ukulele fingerings are given above each song and the simple layout of this book is pleasing to the eye, with chords in blue and lyrids in black. The spiral bound is also a plus to any musician.I would recommend this book only to the person that is already VERY familiar Hawaiian melodies.A webpage has been made by what appears to be the publisher. All melodies found in He Mele Aloha are listed in solfedge with midi files at: http://mele.home.att.net/home.htm"
3,needs better editing,"Even though I agree with the others that the editing is not great, that is not the author's fault. If she makes typos or grammar mistakes it is the editor's job to fix them. This book is good. The characters are enjoyable. Hopefully Ms. Sefton will notice the mistakes and find a better editor."
2,Clumsy,"The plot was okay, but many of the fill-in details seemed clumsily put together. Even though I love knitting, the narrator's descriptions of the yarn store were over the top and her acceptance into the community there was too smooth. And how do so many working women show up in a yarn store for hours every day of the week?I was also irked by the author's limited use of vocabulary and by the way she keeps reminding you of things you learned only a few chapters back. The book ends abruptly, as well, with a lot of unanswered questions. I won't be reading anything else by this author."
3,It is what it is.,"I knit (a lot!), crochet, quilt, and spin (a little). So, I get lost is stories which involve fiber enthusiasts. I was also able to relive visits with family in Colorado from the (gushing)descriptions of the Rockies, Fort Collins, Estes Park, and other locales.Ms. Sefton's characters are not particularly deep, but they are likable. They are the kind of people you would like to have around you if you have problems like those Kelly faces.Is this great writing? No. Is there notable plot or character development? No. Has there been good editing? No - there are too many inconsistencies (forest green yarn becomes emerald a couple of chapters later) and typos (""yard"" for ""yarn"") to go unnoticed.However, if you would like to have a nice visit with fellow fiber enthusiasts and you are looking for a ""beach read,"" this book might appeal to you. It did to me."
2,"Wanted to love it, but just didn't","I liked the book, but had trouble both getting engaged with the characters and keeping all the women straight. And I kept reading that she was adding yarn and needles and notions to her tab and thinking about how HUGE that tab must be, especially for someone supposedly watching her budget!"
2,Poorly edited and a waste of money,"This book is poorly edited and includes grammar mistakes, tense errors, and other mistakes (my favorite from page 48: ""The sound of Carl's growling reached her eyes""). If this sort of thing makes you crazy, as it does me, this book is not for you. Otherwise the book is pleasant enough with a cast of characters and plot very familiar to anyone who reads mystery novels."
2,Hate to rain on the parade but......,"Perhaps having just read the incredible 'destiny's lady' and 'forever and beyond' made it impossible to for this sequel about daughter diana to live up to my expectations. I read 1/3rd of this book and gave it up. The story line is nothing unusual and diana is fairly shallow, much into getting her own way in everything. After very brief interaction diana and jared declare undying love.....Actually Jared's first words (after diana throws herself at him) are things like 'my heart, my love, etc...'. Too much, too soon and boring.......The best part may have come later but I'll never know...but susan grace is a talent to watch and I'll try another of her sequels to lady cat soon............."
3,drama queen costume,This was a very cute costume that my child wanted. The leggings would not stay up on her legs and the braclets were trying to break by the end of the night.
1,Horrible,"Normally, I'm the first person to give a book the benefit of the doubt. Normally, I can ignore short-comings to enjoy a story. This book is one of the few I feel like flinging across a room. It deserves to be burned, it's so awful. I can't even enjoy the plot because there are always these stupid encounters between Spike and Vivian getting in the way. I expected a thriller, but all I've read so far has been something that needs to be made into a SPICE channel movie. Every other chapter is another frustrated encounter between Spike and Vivian. Is THAT supposed to hold my interest?"
1,Terrible!,"This has to be the worst book I've ever read. The relationship between Spike and Vivian made no sense-between the miscommunications and bizarre dialog, I couldn't tell if they loved each other, hated each other, lusted after each other, or all of the above. The abundance of other non-sensical characters made me forget that this was actually a murder mystery. Don't waste your money."
5,brings back memories,"i remember this from when it came out (and i was just starting college). the heads where at/near their creative height and eno was (almost) becoming a household name - ok, maybe that's a stretch.anyway, the music is fine. haunting. fun to move to. fun to have playing in the background. fun to imagine as an imaginary soundtrack to that movie you wanted to make.time hasn't lessened it's impact. worth a spin. you'll find yourself putting it back on the player."
1,Not so sure...,"All of the other reviewers on this site gave this album rave reviews, and it seems to be one of the classics that is still readily available in stores. I am a huge fan of Brian Eno and David Burn, but I'm not sure what the two together were doing with this album. Frankly, after listening to it once, I threw it in the trash. It was just too tiring to listen to again."
4,Feel Good,If you like The BandNewHeavies and The Rebirth you will love D' Nell. The Cd is must for your collection.
4,karyn white does it right.,"with charm, style, sophistication and a damn good voice, it's a wonder that karyn white has been unable to maintain the success she found with her eponymous debut. white has always produced strong albums with a number of chart-quality songs on each, but _make him do right_ is her best yet! songs like ""hungah"" and ""simple pleasures"" resurrect the sexy, playful image exuded on _ritual of love_ while ""can i stay with you"", ""i'd rather be alone"" and ""make him do right"" reveal white to be on the road to becomming a classic (if under-rated) talent in the vein of miki howard or regina belle. white takes co-writing credits on most of the albums tracks--along with jimmy jam & terry lewis--as well as scoring a couple of babyface numbers. this album is solid from beginning to end and hints at what ms. white is truly capable of."
4,Vector Maxx inverter,We use these inverters to replace 400 Watt inverters that came in the vehicle. This is a fleet and they use these inverters every day. So far I have used 10 of these inverters with no problems.
1,made to fail,Made to fail. The worst products for plumbing I have yet found. It did not make it five minutes before the plastic failed and it started to leak.
1,Problems with Windows XP,"i just bought a new and powerful system... with windows XP, home edition... I cannot get this game to work on my system.. I've tried everything.... Can U help?"
5,This player is great,"This player is everything I was looking for. I've never been too partial to the iPod because you can't use it without iTunes and I just wanted a music player that you can simply drag n drop music. I make my usual Rock, Rap, Country etc folders on my computer and simply copy and paste into the Vibez. I can go over my friends house and do the same...any computer anywhere. Unlike the iPod which requires the CPU hogging iTunes. Very simple user interface. The magnetic scroll wheel is very nice and useful. You can play music by year, genre, album, artist, folder or many others. The DJ option is great too. I have the 8 GB version which is plenty and it has flash memory so theres no worries about dropping it and messing up a spinning hard drive. For approx. $160 I think I got more than my money's worth. The only complaint I would have is the default maximum sound volume is a bit on the quiet side. I fixed that by increasing the settings in the equalizer and making my own preset."
1,Be careful of the title!,"When I bought HomsSite, I was having some trouble understanding part of the program so I went looking for a book and found Forta's. When I got the copy, I went to the section where I was trying to solve the problem. (It had to do with the icons in the Resource window.) I got more confused because what Forta was telling me to do didn't match with the program.After tearing out my hair for awhile, I found the problem: I had HomeSite 4.5 and Forta was writing about 4.0 and his book didn't show the changes, including exactly what I was trying to solve.In short, I had wasted my money.So be careful of the 4 in that title. If you are using 4.5, you might be in trouble. There is that much change between the two."
5,We're all gonna laugh at him.,"We sure will after hearing this one. Sandler's CDs always have that one common element that is repeated throughout (such as the excited Southerner, the Cool Guy), and here, it is the Buffoon. The Buffoon is a totally obliterated, obscene moron who blurts out really strange observations and anecdotes. (but, man, is it ever hilarious!) A nice treat is that you'll get surprised by the Buffoon more than you think on this CD.As always, Sandler's songs are inspired (by a demented mind, no doubt). The best skits are the Buffoon, 'Toll Booth Willie', 'I'm So Wasted', 'Buddy', and 'The Longest Pee'.Of course, the standard disclaimer applies here: if you're easily offended...you don't like swearing...if you don't like innuendoes concerning food objects...don't listen to this, for heaven's sake. On the other hand, if you want to spend some quality time hearing some of Adam Sandler's great material, this one is a keeper."
3,Not as good as the others,"I purchased this CD thinking that it would be as good as Sandler's other endeavors. I was wrong. It doesn't have the repeat play factor, that is, it's not funny enough to put on loop and laugh at every single time. The songs are the best part. Sandler never disappoints when it comes to his trusty musical angle. But the sketches are just not all that funny. But we can forgive Adam becuase it's one of his first CD attempts."
3,Outside Temp Fails to Impress,I love everything about this clock. The options for sound and display are perfect. The projection is just the right intensity. I would be happy as pie except that the signal to outdoor temp keeps failing! Leaving me with the time and a -- for outside temp reading. I've moved it closer and closer to the clock. I have to re-set it every time by sticking it RIGHT next to the clock for a good hour before it reads again and then slowly move it away. Every time I put it outside it fails. =( blah.
2,Atomic time feature very frustrating,"The atomic feature on this clock is very frustrating. And, no, it is not because of the time zone. The clock will be off by weird amounts. 43 minutes, 22 minutes, etc....I have tried to turn off the atomic feature, but to no avail.Right now I am searching for a new alarm clock because I have had it with this one. I would rather reset the clock if I lose power rather than have sporadic time problems.Too bad, because I really like the nature sounds. No noticeable loops."
2,Nice unit-too much light for a bedroom,"This unit has wonderful sounds and works well, unfortunately, if left on as we would like, it emits too much light to be able to sleep. We had to turn it off and use the, I believe, it was the snooze button to get the stats on the ceiling. It was disappointing and we returned it."
2,Not the Best,"So I needed a new alarm due to my kitten eating through the wire of my old one. I could not find the old one, witch i loved, in stores. I found this one and decided to give it a try.I the spa sound a cool plus but like others have stated the speakers on the little clock suck for great sound.Also the light for the clock and the projection light were way to bright. I need almost total darkness to sleep and this was not it.Also, i did not have the problem with the 1 hour switch. i had it go weirdo on me. I time stopped working all together. As if you hit a reset button. I would reset it only to find a few hours later it did it again.\I found my old clock here on amazon and will stick to that one."
2,Remote temerature doesn't work,The unit works OK but the outdoor temperature is 5 degrees off and the unit regularly loses the signal to the remote sensor.
4,Good basic book about general safety,"Book doesn't go in depth about specific topics, rather it skims over different issues that may come up. You will have to discuss safety in more depth with your child. Overall, a good way to bring up the subject."
3,NO NATALIA KASTLE,"MY BIGGEST GRIPE WITH THIS GAME WAS THAT THEY KILLED OFF NATALIA KASTLE IN ISSUE 6 OF DANGER GIRL AND THEN BEFORE ISSUE 7 EVEN CAME OUT THEY INTRODUCE THIS CHICK J.C. I WISH YOU COULD HAVE PLAYED AS NATALIA. AFTERALL, SHE WAS A DANGER GIRL UP TO ISSUE 6."
4,Releases and Girls,"It may be me, but who is that third girl on the cover? It might have to do with the fact is that they can't get the issues out. Even this game was subject to countless delays. You do have to say that they put some time in on this game."
3,Good Debut,"This stunning Mississippi songbird's debut features an exceptionally strong choice of songs. Particularly, Karen Staley/Bob DiPiero's ""Take Me As I Am,"" which became a #1 single for Hill. Her debut single, ""Wild One,"" is here, and became a top ten single as well. A fine rendition of Janis' Joplin's ""Baby, Take A Piece of My Heart"" rounds out this successful effort, and launched Hill's mega-successful career. While Hill had never paid her dues as a staff songwriter, she goes a long ways toward proving looks, a great voice, and dating a music row executive can take you far."
5,Great Read,I thought this book was very well written. It really captures the challenges that exists in the head coaching position's at Universities. For all that really did not know the truth about Bobby Willimas and his struggles at MSU will learn a great deal after reading this wonderful book. It is also a motivational book for students and athlethes....A must read!!
5,"Daddy's plastic, will get some more use....","In this amazing book, the sequel to ""The Clique"", Claire is still struggling to get into the clique. She'll do anything for it. Massie is still as scheemingly evil as ever, and is up to no good. All of the other girls are fighting with each other, over a boy. This is a truly entertaining book, and it is great!!"
4,A LOT of dots,My son is 8 and saw a similar book at the bookstore that he wanted but it had almost 300 dots per picture and that seemed too confusing so I bought this one instead. The other book gave me eyestrain and a headache just looking at those tiny numbers but this book is clearly marked with about a third less numbers to deal with. He enjoys it and I am happy.
4,Addicted,"I got Book 3 on a whim when I was getting some other things so I could get the free shipping. I do not regret the purchase at all. Although this book isn't as good as the 3 one, I still enjoy it none the less.It was hard to figure out what the final picture was going to be just by looking at the dots which made it fun and exciting. I even like to look back at the pictures after i've completed the book."
2,Awesome book,I like this book because it is a three in one book. To me Judy Moody is a very funny character. By Alyssa Giera
4,Great DVD detailing the basics in Professional Puppet Building,"Its a great DVD set of 2 discs, shows the whole process in an easy way. Gives some great ideas if you dont follow all the steps religiously you can use it as inspiration, just like the book. The book is great too, its much the same but sometimes its more handy to have a book rather than the DVD so if you are serious about it get both!One thing that I noticed was the DVD discs are not professionally pressed which doesn't matter at all, or make any difference to most people but it could possibly be a problem for very very old DVD players with playing them. They are burnt using dvd-r discs but ofcourse are official DVDs as they are from Grey Seal Puppets. They have a professional case and DVD label however.Its a great buy for anyone considering puppet building and wants some tips and inspiration!"
5,Paul Simon: 1964/1993 Boxed Set,"Two words: Paul Simon. He's a master of music, a genius in his art. This boxed set captures many of his greatest songs but it is lacking in some S&G hits. Maybe they saved those for the S&G Old Friends boxed set? However you see it, there is no doubt about it: Paul Simon is simply amazing. It's not very often that a musician can leave me so speechless. This boxed set--with its music, lyrics, and incredible vocals--does wonders for the soul."
5,Great sounding breakthrough album,"I gave this 5 stars because it sounds great, there are plenty of liner notes to read, and I'm a huge fan and sorta biased.......Great art comes from pain. These guys were all hurting during recording, but managed to turn out some brilliant material. My favorite track is the title, showing a haunting side of Jay Farrar."
4,"did someone say ""overrated""?","don't get me wrong: this is a fairly impressive record, and ""slate"" is one of the greatest songs i've ever heard in my life, but overall it's turned out to be something of a letdown for me. i prefer the peter buck produced release that proceeded this one -- it sounds more raw, immediate, and honest."
3,Alt-highlights,"UT and Anodyne are heavily cited as a pillar of alt-country influence, and while that may be true, a few penned rockers and weepers have come to outweigh the majority of steel-pedal serviceability and electric-clunk on display."
2,Warning: try another brand first!,"less elastic in consistency than other brands, I bought these to use w/ do-it-yourself hair extension kit, they performed poorly"
4,"'ey gringo, is no' so bad man!!!!","For those of you who like your travel experiences to be wild and exciting, 'The Gringo Trail' has to be worth a read. Mark Mann cleverly strings together his experiences of travelling in Latin America, with astute cultural observations and hair raising experiences. From hold ups on public transport, to drug fuelled mayhem and Shamanism, Mann gorges himself on all the diversity that South america has to offer. An enjoyable read, sure to be exchanged on the travelling circuit for many years to come!!!"
2,"item sent, but wrong colors","I had two problems with this order: First, they sent me a different color pallette than the one I had ordered (which was pictured). Secondly, the seller charged me $8.95 for shipping, and my very tiny package came via U.S. mail, which should have cost about $3 maximum, to ship."
1,A big dissapointment,"I was very dissapointed in this video, the signs in this video were done by a child and they were very unclear, I didn't really learn anything because I was unsure if I was doing the signs right.I wouldn't recommend this video if you actually want to learn sign languageJ!"
2,"OK, but alittle disappointing","My daughter and I have learned some signing in our playgroup classes with children nursery songs. After a while I realized she was actually using the signs to describe what she was seeing or just to tell me what song she wanted to sing. I was hoping this video would also be put together in a fun, entertaining way to continue teaching my daughter and new infant. Unfortunately it was much too basic with only a few words taught and about 15 minutes long. This could have been drafted into a few paged of a softcover booklet and been used more of reference guide for the parents."
1,Complete trash,"These things didn't last very long at all before breaking. After using the set for my class party I made sure to rinse them in warm water, but it didn't matter. My students and I left the classroom and when I came back about 5 mysteriously turned back on. It turns out they leaked and the liquid screwed with the electronics. A day later 18/24 had succumb to this problem and I was unable to control the on and off button.I know these cubes aren't designed to be perfect but this is unacceptable. I've gotten different brands of glow cubes from Disneyland over the last year or so and have never had them be this bad. They all default back to the red LED when exposed to ice cold temperatures for extended amounts of time so that's to be expected, but the failure rate of these cubes is over the top. Do not buy! Look for LitedICECubes if you need glow cubes."
4,Lovely singing voice,3 yo daughter is scared of people- likes watching the first 2 songs on this one- the Hello and Happy songs. The Angry and Sad songs are too overwhelming for her but I think I will persist in showing this to her- I think its worth it because understanding your emotions helps you to verbalize them and deal with them better. Elizabeth has an amazing voice too!
5,The Master,"The single greatest Al Jarreau album ever by the greatest jazz artist of our time. Not a single average cut on it. You will wear it out playing it. If your jazz library does not have this CD, it's incomplete. My favorite cuts: ""Dinosaur"" and ""She's Leaving home"". Deep, evocative and profound.TRACER LEE VAUGHN (Philip Von Borries)"
1,The Best of Los del Rio,"This was one of the worst, mixed up messes that I gave it to the library and only heard a part of it. Junk!!!!!!"
3,Not for General Readers,"Author Paul Cartledge quite obviously knows his stuff, and shows it in his book ""The Spartans."" Unfortunately, it appears that he knows his stuff a little too well for his book to be of much interest to non-academic readers. This is surprising, given that the book is being marketed as a companion piece to an upcoming PBS special about Greece's legendary warriors. Though the book is relatively brief at around 300 pages, it is so packed full of dates, names, places and events as to become bewildering to anyone who is not already intimately familiar with the subject matter. I'm a history buff myself, but I had a hard time following the narrative. The author writes as if he's addressing graduate level history students with a speciality in the subject.Overall, ""The Spartans"" is very well researched, but will be of little interest to general readers."
2,45 Minutes of amature video showing layouts during shows.,"I didn't much care for this one. The video was shot during public shows. Most of the time you see the other show goers in the scenes and in reflections in the plexiglass of the layouts. These are hardly the ""Greatest HO Layouts"". The work on most of the few displays was medicore at best. I'm using videos made by Allen Keller Productions as a standard (very professional). They have a line of tapes called ""Great Model Railroads"" each covering layouts that are award winners, and well known classics. At least they took the time to remove the plexiglass for shooting. There were even scenes on this one showing people fixing derailments and SLOWLY putting structures on during a show."
1,DO NOT BUY - extremely narrow,DO NOT BUY ++++ Product shoes not as described the width is extremely narrow - only 3 toes can fit in shoe. This is deceptive to buyers on Amazon DO NOT BUY you will be sorry and out the money to ship them back.
3,Not my favorite DCD,"This album is less compelling for me than some of their others. The tracks are mostly spacey vocals, and I miss the duo's fine instrumentals."
4,"Good, not the best...","I bought this CD for ""The Ubiquitous mr. Lovegrove"" and ""The Carnival is over"", about the 2 best DCD songs in my opinion. Maybe I should have listened to the rest of the album tough... Not that's it's bad, but there is several songs featuring silly bird noises which are driving me mad every time I hear them (Yulunga, Towards the within... I litterally skip those songs)We're getting dangerously close to New age music here...If you're like me you probably love DCD for Brendan Perry's awesome voice and lyrics more than anything else. So there's about 4-5 songs you'll fully enjoy on Into the labyrinth. The rest of the album is OK, great balance as usual, but overall it's not as good as, say, Within the realm of a dying sun (of course)."
4,The Ubiquitous Mr. Lovegrove,"This song is worth the price of the CD alone. Who thought they could write what seems almost like a pop tune (without being at all cheesy)?Lisa soars on ""The Wind That Shakes The Barley"" in English!! and a capella!!""Yulunga"" clears the way for an album like Spiritchaser.A couple of songs are a little weaker--but still great.A must own for DCD fans and newbies alike."
1,cheesy game,"this gaMe looked cool when i bought it because of the cover. i read the back and it seemed prety cool. but once i put it in i got bored the first twenty minuets. the missions were lame, the game play stunk. ..."
1,Wild Metal isn't really wild,Wild Metal Wow! This game is a waste of money. When youhear the title you think wow this game is going to be awesome. I shotother tanks with my tank and they blow up and there is blood. Well That isn't what happens. Here are 5 good reasons not to buy this game.1.)The tank that you are driving goes about 1 mile per hour and it takes for ever.2.)Each stage takes for ever because you drive so slow.3.)You have to find 10 things in each level and it takes so long to find theme cause they are everywhere and you don't even have a map.4.)There are hardly any bad guys in the game so it is boring.5.)There isn't any music playing so it is so boring and the only thing that you hear is the engine of your tank going.
2,toooooo much narration!,"I have enjoyed several Cities of the World travel DVDs distributed by Travel Video Store prior to this one and Egypt. While the photography remains quite good and the sites presented well balanced, in both these the narrator seems to think more is better. In both the narration is a rapid-fire sing-song delivery which to me and my wife quickly detracts from the enjoyment of the video. Reducing the narrative to one half or preferably one third of what is given would allow a more measured pleasant delivery and avoid the relentless drone with which the viewer is barraged!"
1,Ghost In The Machine,"When Mick Foley wrote about the ridiculous pitfalls of having a ghost writer initially ruin his life's story in the early stages of what became his self-penned, runaway best-seller, Have a Nice Day!, it should have been a warning for at least slightly more artistic control by others when their stories would be chronicled in the ongoing WWF/WWE series.In this autobiography of Joanie Laurer and her character, Chyna, it sometimes packs a punch, but is weighted down by writer Michael Angeli, who seems to feel that her story of a tragic childhood and struggles to claw to the top in the wrestling industry requires sophomoric jokes and ridiculous imagery.Sadly, what is a powerful story cannot ultimately rise from the crass overproduction; like so many storylines in the professional wrestling according to Vince McMahon. This is an outstanding example of the series at its most over-the-top, which means it is never had a ghost of a chance to be a successful autobiography."
3,ENTERTAINING AND INTERESTING,ACTUALLY I GIVE THIS 3.5 STARS. THIS BOOK IS FOR FANS OF CHYNA AND WRESTLING MOSTLY. MISS LAURER IS VERY FOUL MOUTHED AND WRITES ABOUT TOPICS THAT SHOULD NOT BE READ BY YOUNG CHILDREN. HER PARENTS WERE NOT VERY GOOD PARENTS AT ALL. I THINK JOANIE FELT VERY UNLOVED AND INSECURE. SHE IS QUITE OPEN ABOUT HER INNER FEELINGS AND EXPRESSES HER OPINIONS THROUGH OUT THE BOOK. MANY INTERESTING STORIES AND INFORMATION ABOUT THE WRESTLING WORLD ARE TOLD. I LIKE THIS BOOK AND RECOMMEND IT TO OLDER CHILDREN (AGE 12 AND OLDER). I THINK JOANIE IS VERY HUMAN AND A GOOD PERSON. ALSO HAS SOME GREAT PICS OF THIS SUPER HOTTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Great for the price!,"Installed in short amount of time, looks good, and has held up to my 200+ pounds daily."
4,"Unique, fun, challenging and a one-of-a-kind game","I am not a real time strategy fan, I'm just not sure what that is exactly, but leave it up to game revewiers and the PC gaming community to come up with such silly terms!The Myth series is a charming, nice looking game set in a midevil fantasy setting based around your ability to line up your various characters on-the-fly and defend their positions in various outdoor environments. Bomb throwing elves, archers, and sword wielding knights fight off enemies and monsters while you protect a guide or your leader through various missions in forests and through small villages.This scenery is well detailed and nice to look at, and the controls are relatively simple and easy to pick up.This game is so cheap now it's worth checking out, even for just a few hours of fun.It's simply one of those charming, classic games I'll always remember and hold close to my video game loving heart."
5,Thank you! Thank you!,"I've been interpreting Mass at my church for 5 years and I am so thankful to have found this book! It is wonderful to have a 'second opinion' in trying to gloss some of the more difficult concepts clearly. And, it's fun to see how many of my ideas are the same as Ms. Blake's! Talk about a confidence builder! The index is a plus. I just used it today to help find the glosses for the upcoming Immaculate Conception mass. However, I think anyone trying to gloss Bible readings, regardless of religous preference, would find this book handy. When is Cycle A coming out?? And how about a book of Mass songs????"
2,Not made in Spain,"I just received my order of six (6) packages or Artesano True Rustic Style Chorizo - advertised as made in Spain. What I received is clearly marked made in the USA. I have not opened or tasted the chorizo, but clearly disappointed about the misrepresentation."
3,BRET GOT WHAT WAS COMING,YOU ALL CAN CRY ABOUT BRET BUT WWF MADE HIM AND HE LEFT THEM BECAUSE WCW WOULD PAY BETTER SO F HIM GREEDY BASTERD.WATCH THIS TAPE THE END IS VERY FUNNY.
4,Mealtime Protector,"The mealtime protector is great for my 88 years old mom. It is colorful, practical, and inexpensive. It is also easy for her to put on. The only change I would make is adding a pocket at the bottom so limited amounts of food fall on the floor."
1,spend more to get better quality,"We rolled the dice to get this, figured it was cheap enough to try. It is very poor quality - cannot use it on a motorcycle, too much interference and sound quality make it unusable. Spend more to get a motorcycle helmet set up."
4,A beautiful deck,"The artistry of this deck is quite beautiful. I enjoy just looking through the cards and enjoying the colors and details. Clearly this deck was a labor of love. I have not used this deck for tarot readings because I am more comfortable with the Rider Waite symbolism, which this deck deviates from. Nonetheless, I'm glad I own this deck because it is so beautiful to look through."
1,foreign dvd,"I was dissapointed with this purchase,because the DVD does not work neither on my lap top or the home dvd player.I can hear only the music and words.Is this because it is a foreign dvd? I expected to see a video demonstration.very unhappy will return this product.as it does not work in usa dvd players."
4,Rocking Book,Everything that a budding blues pianist needs in the quest for entertainment mastery. A must for anyone who needs to spice up thier playing.
2,"Help me, I'm confused!","I currently drive a 1974 MG Midget and have been looking into getting a second classic car. Maybe an Alfa? I was hoping this book would explain (and show) the many different models of Alfa's that are out there. This is not the book for that. First the pictures are all black and white and kind of dark and soft. But worse, the author spends the first two chapters of the book explaining how confusing the names of Alfa's are (no kidding? ..that's why I bought your book). When he finally gets around to try and sort out the mess he only makes me more confused. When explaining one model he starts talking about another models..from 30 years ago...and then he throws in comments about Ferrari's? He jumps from one time period to another. He is all over the place. The guy has ADD or something.I'm sure once you get all the different models down (from another book, of course) this book will give you lots of insight. But don't buy this book if you are not already an Alfa expert!"
1,Very Poor Product,"After just over a year, the dehumidifier no longer works. Control panel indicates ""LO"" and Haier customer support tells me I need to have the unit serviced because the refrigerant is low. Customer support was not at all surprised and indicated this is typical behavior for the product.In addition, when it was working, the unit would cycle on and off several load and annoying times before it actually engaged. The humidity sensor crosses over a set point and then the fan kicks on and causes the humidity sensor to fall below the set point and the fan turns off. This cycle repeats several times until the humidity is sufficient to cause the unit to stay on. Very annoying.Do not buy this product."
1,"Haier waranty is a ""NIGHTMARE"" DO NOT BUY HAIER","This unit worked for 3 months then stopped removing water. Called customer service and was told to send $14.99 plus cut an 8 inch piece off power cord and pull off unit number sticker and send to a P.O. box in N.J. After verification would receive a new unit in 7-10 days. After 10 days called and was told it would be 15 days. Still no unit so called again and was told 15 working days. Still no unit so wrote e-mail to customer service and 5 days later was given a 800 hotline number, called that number and was told unit would be sent by FEDEX that day. 5 days later still no unit, called again and was told order went to wrong warehouse and was being corrected and would be sent that day. 6 weeks have past and no unit, this outfit just keeps jerking your chain, The worst customer service ever. My advice do not buy."
2,Haier does not stand by warranty!,"Had this unit for two years and then compressor died. Sealed system is supposedly warranted for five years. Haier sent me to two different service companies, both of which refused to do warranty work on this unit. One service person was told by his company ""don't touch it!"". In my experience they do not stand by their products. Stay away!"
5,My SLR feels lonely,"I purchased my C-2500 before Christmas and haven't any regrets . Using it is much more of a breeze then I have read in the reviews. Now I send family or customers photos that are so nicely done that they always think they are 35mm. I print them out on my HP-1100 printer. What a great pair. I purchased readers, But really never use or hassle with them . I think both the camera & printer, together are what really increases the enjoyment. I also have both lenses and the flash attachment. Lenses are worth it, but haven't mastered the flash settings yet.The investment was hard but has paid me back already."
5,The best sounding electric strings I have ever used.,"First, some backround. I play a Gibson Les Paul Studio, a Godin Solidac, a Fender Stratocaster American Standard, and an Ibanez Artcore AFS75T (someday I'll get a Gretsch), and play via a Fender Blues Deluxe amp. I have been a pure nickel string purist for a few years. These sound better. The 1st time I put a set of these strings on my Les Paul, I was floored. Even my guitar teacher, who has used every string out there, was stunned. The best way to describe it is: it is like moving up to the next gauge while not increasing the tension and feel; i.e. I am used to playing .10s, but the change in tone sounds like .11s. And they last longer to boot (they are uncoated, by the way). Yes, I have played Pyramid strings, and I like these better; unlike the Pyramids, these strings did not require a new setup."
5,Satisfaction,The book arrived shortly after I ordered it. Everything was as promised. I would order from this seller again.
3,Watch Your Measurement,"The quality of the boxes were great and the lids fit very snug. The one thing is the measurements of the box itself. The description said 4 inch square by 2 inches deep. The 4 inches are outside sizes. What I had wanted to put in these boxes were just under 4 inches and therefore would not fit. Oh well, live and learn."
5,Good and affordable meals,"The recipes are very simple, and you can find the ingredients anywhere (unlike Martha Stewart recipes which call for expensive, hard-to-find ingredients). The meals could be enjoyed by vegetarians or non-vegetarians alike. Its a very simple, unpretentious recipe book. I highly recommend it. My favorite recipes so far have been the bean tacos and Welsh rarebit. Also, I can't wait to try ""Heather's Lemon Pudding Cake"" (isn't her daughter named Heather? This must be one of her's)."
3,"only 2, maybe 3","tracks worth listening to. I wondered why the only cuts the radio plays are Blister & Add. Now I know why. Rest of the CD has moments, but is nowhere as good as those 2."
3,"Good for some ""you've got to be kidding"" laughs...","Closely follows ""Gilligan""s Island"" storyline in that there are ""Maryann"" , ""Ginger"", ""Mr. Howell"", etc characters, trapped on an island. Only differences are that this movie is funnier! Man-eating plants, people who do stupid things when confronted with danger, a terrible lack of kickstands and chain smoking all lead to a pretty silly movie that was not even filmed on Hydra, one of the reasons we started watching the movie."
1,Waldorf and Statler would have a field day with this one!,"How could they do this to the Muppets?!?! I was overjoyed when I heard of the Muppet game, but sadly I shouldn't have been. This is one of the worst games for the GBC. The control is awful, the graphics are barely passable and the characters look nothing like their normal selves. Kermit and Animal are so tiny that you can't make out any body language. They're just green and red blobs moving about. The music is really awful too. When it boots up the music is barely audible, then once the ""game"" starts you get a repettive bore of a score. Don't even mention the ""story line"" and action of the game itself. It's just all so basic and executed so poorly. The Muppets hold so much promise for a terrific game and to see it wasted is painful. All we can do now is hope for a better effort on the Game Boy Advance."
2,Poor Kermit,"You know, when I saw that there was a Muppet's game I was thrilled! I rented it and got and home...then I was sad. The game has got to be more impossible then getting to the moon on foot. Play control is so akward, the sound effects could blow out your ear drums, and I never figured out how to get rid of enemies! It was so hard walk up onto anything, or down to anything for that matter. There isn't any reaction that tells you that you've hit and enemy, power-ups are scarce...and poor Kermit! He is short and squatty; he looks like a renegade from ""Frogger""! The game was poorly devolped and suffers from an unfortunate lack of imagination. If you are interested I suggest renting if first, and if you find that you have more patience than I then make a purchase, but don't blame me when your Game Boy goes out the window..."
4,"Nice socks, nice price","Sorry, I can't reveal anything extrordinary about these socks, but they are perfectly servicable, attractive, and, at least when I got them, cheap.No complaints at all."
4,do trousers have socks?,are toe's golden? wish I knew if my son actually wears this gift or if it went into the back of his sock drawer?
3,Updated Tub/shower look,"Easy install. The directions don't say this, but when you install the tub spout as a slip fit over a copper pipe (no threads), need to take it apart. The two white insert unscrews completely. Put lots of teflon tape on both male threads and the brass nut then re-assemble. Be sure to put vasaline on the pipe to slip on the spout without distroying the o-ring inside the brass nut. Cinch down the holding screw in the brass nut tightly and finish screwing the spout until you can't turn it any more. This will prevent the spout from leaking between the spout and the wall. This is a common problem. The support people at Danco are pretty helpful, should you need more help."
5,Excellent Book!,"This book was my bible and helped tremendously with every process of the admissions process. As a result, I was able to get into Michigan (Ross), Darden, and Kelley for the Fall 05 semester with a not so great GMAT score. Even for the schools I did not get into (Kellogg and Tuck), I was a highly competitive candidate fighting for scarce seating.I definitely owe my success to this book because I was able to market myself convincing with my current credentials."
3,'Who Can' rather than 'How to' Get into the TOP MBA Programs,"If you find the advice offered by this book insightful, trust me, forget about your applications for the top b-schools. What? You scored 650+ in the GMAT and you don't know what to emphasize in your essays? Don't you think it is ironic that an applicant for the top B-schools doesn't know the ""right marketing strategy"" for the application? Most of the advice is just common sense for the applicants (of course, those who are likely to be admitted) with ""solid academic aptitude "" and ""strong managerial potential"". This is just a book to confirm ""Who can Get into the Top MBA Programs""."
4,Timeless...sort of,"The book is a little outdated now, but the basics are still relevant. Learn how to reflect on your experiences and what makes you unique. Figure out how to craft your story. Find out some of the strengths and nuances about reputations from some of the schools. Warning, however...leave yourself ample time to put it all together. Good MBA applications require good thought and practiced execution."
1,Misleading waste of money,My Mom taught me to always find something good in everything so here goes. Montauk did an excellent job of using 453 pages to say nothing of relevance. He also did a good job of using the cover to build hype.Now here's the skinny so you don't have to continue reading between the lines. This book is a voluminous pile of garbage. There is nothing in here that you can't easily find on the businessweek.com or usnews.com or businessschooladmission.com or other such website.
1,Disappointing,This book is now outdated and not very helpful. Looking forward to get my money back!!
4,Good start point,"I found the book very helpful in two stages of the MBA application process.First, when I wondered about what's an MBA all about and the basics of how do you get in. I found excellent advice in the book and I consider it as the best review in the subject I have read (and beleive me I read a lot...).Finally, when I wrote my essays, I found extremely useful the last section of the book, where you could find several examples of essays from people from the most diverse backgrounds.I have been recently admitted in two fine MBA program in the U.S. and I think that this guide helped me to get started and to know better how to approach the essays. I think though, that the book is just a start and a support for the process. Don't think that the book is going to do the job for you!If you are serious about seeking an MBA and you would like to hear an opinion on the process from some other than your friends, you MUST buy this book."
5,An Excellent Book for New and Veteran Cigar Lovers,"There is nothing like enjoying a good cigar. This guide is clear, concise, and well-organized. There is a chapter on small cigars and cigarillos and a number of these are rated, in addition to rating larger cigars. This is a fine reference work."
1,Very unreliable,"I have had the Gyration keyboard/mouse for about 6 months now and I finally reached my pain threshold. These things are so unreliable that it feels like a bad joke. They might work ok for a few days in a row and then, out of the blue, they will simply stop working altogether or will begin to misbehave, for example, the mouse becomes unresponsive or the keyboard starts missing keypresses. Then you change batteries (which, btw, do not last very long), reset the system, and pray to the remote gods.... and, tough luck, they continue to not work properly. You give up and go do something else, come back, and if it is your lucky day, it will start working again. If you are unlucky (I am!), forget it and come back tomorrow.To compound the issue, their customer service is completely unresponsive. Too bad it is too late for me to return this item."
4,school daze,I could watch this movie over and over again. Reminds me of my college days on the yard. Love it!!
5,True black college experience...,"Any one who has gone to an HBCU can aprreciate this movie. The events that took place in this film still take place today, in 2006. This is a true to life story with dynamic characters. Please do not let this movie deter you from wanting to become aprt of the Divine Nine. Spike Lee did a wonderful job. This movie set a higher standard for Black films of its time. This movie also helped many careers flourish."
4,good keyboard,"Have ony had this KB/mouse a week, but like them a lot. My first KB with the extra buttons, and they are very handy.I took one star off because I think it feels cheap, cheap plastic keys. Take that for what it's worth, it still functions perfectly."
2,Interesting viewing but wretched transfers,"I would like to have rated this higher, but the quality is so poor, I can't. In true Alpha Video form, they have just slapped a few old episodes from some tapes they found somewhere onto a DVD, and expect the consumer to be satisified. Oddly enough, Alpha also slaps their watermarked logo onto the screen in the lower right hand or upper right hand corner from time to time....as if anyone would want to steal and re-sell these rotten transfers!As I said, this is Alpha's reputation. However, when I found this in a used store for a couple of bucks, I thought it was worth it to give it a shot. I had only seen the later revival series (early '70's?), and was really curious. It was a real throwback, as far as the content was concerned. Quite quaint, yet still entertaining.It's too bad a legitimate video company doesn't release some of these older, forgotten shows from the 50's. I would be first in line."
1,Not like picture!!!!,"I ordered this as it is pictured as a small, flat, resonably priced, good looking center speaker. NOT WHAT YOU GET!!!! When it comes it is a boxy, square, shiney, plastic, cheap looking piece of crap. I can't believe Wharfedale would even put its name on something like this. It is not worth paying to ship it back for what it cost, so I just threw it on my ""taken for a ride"" pile for my next garage sale and got a good BIC America center speaker."
3,Only pure Type 2 Need Read This Book,"I was very disappointed when I opened the book and read various areas seeking current information on insulin production, injection, pumping and diabetic classifications since the changes of 2003. I am now 53 years old. I was diagnosed with diabetes at 38. Due to medical ignorance, rather than adaguate testing, the Adult Onset of high Blood Glucose was treated with oral medication for 5 months. I had no pointers currently recognised for Type 2. Finally it was suggested I might want to consult a specialist familiar with using insulin. He looked at my Log Book and with and overall dailey use of 24 units had me under 150mg/dL as an average reading the same week. This book is very simple, written at a grade school level (at least it used to be grade school) and only treatment of Type 2 with Diet, Exercise, and Oral Medication is set forth with any detail. The general title is deceptive. Barry J. Shiffert"
5,one of a kind,old songs brought to life in Jimmy's own style and beautifully orchestratedwith the big band sound where required..in great stereophonic hi fidelity..great stuff..
2,This cd brings back a lot of old memories,"For as long as I can remember Jimmy Durante has been around. He really wasn't that great of singer or pianist, but everybody loved Jimmy. I guess to be honest, Jimmy was a little different than most entertainers. He was down to earth and sometimes rather corney.On this cd Jimmy sings, as best he can, some beautiful songs. He uses the Gordon Jenkins orchestra to accompany him on several songs. The biggest concern I for this cd is the fact that some of the arrangements were not what Ithought they should have been. For the most part the repertoire was great.For the sake of Jimmy and the fond memories we have of him, I think it would be fitting to honor him by buying this cd.Recommendation: I would like to recommend this cd to you"
5,Jimmy Durante Sings,A very nostalgic look at a great funny man who knows how to sing love songs. He gets the feelings across and touches your heartstrings.
4,One of the better brands,"I've been trying, and reviewing, some of the undenatured whey products.The ImmunoPro is one of the better brands that I've tried.Its only slightly more than the least expensive brand I've tried,the ImmunPlex, and when I mixed it with the ImmunPlex,I could see the benefits more clearly.It doesn't mix as well as the ImmunPlex, but it might be a little better.Its not that its 'bad' to mix,but undenatured whey products can *not* be mixed in a blender,because the biologically active compounds are pretty delicate.Most brands recommend mixing via the 'shaker cup' method.I usually just gently stir it with a fork, into appx, 4 oz. of water,although the dairy substitute, ""Rice Dream"" is good too.I may go back to ImmunoPro, but for now, I've got to watch those pennies,and the small savings is important to me.I would recommend ImmunoPro to anyone looking to try an undenatured whey."
2,OK,"The pictures are misleading. This clock does not project the temperature at all. I ordered this clock and recieved it in an obviously ""used"" condition. There were scratches and fingerprints all over it. Not good considering the price I paid."
4,"Concise, clear, easy to use","I found myself going to this book much more often than to my HTML course textbook when looking things up. Still do, too! Highly recommended!"
3,"I thought it was easy, but...","I have many web sites. My girlfriend wanted to make money on the internet too. I told her she needs to learn HTML and so, I bought her this book.I skimmed through it and thought it was great. I even learned some useful things about some of the tags that I am now using on my sites. Of course, I already had a good understanding of HTML in the first place.She, however, thought this book was really confusing. I think if she would practice what the book says and see the tags in action, she would have a better understanding of HTML.Because of the confusion she had, I gave the book 3 stars."
1,Lacking at every turn!,"Hype. Pure hype. The book didn't even answer my most basic questions. As for html 4 coverage, I won't even go there. Pass this by. It doesn't even make a good door stop."
4,"Great analysis well written, no patronizing","Great analysis well written, no patronizing, a MUST for developers"
5,Don't leave home without it!,I am a professional Web developer. I used the 3rd edition all the time for reference and it has even gotten me out of a couple sticky spots. I recommend this book when people ask me what to read. I can't wait to get ahold of the 4th edition!
4,"It is clear, consice, and gives all you need to know","I found the book to be a great reference and teaching tool. The author's style is direct and to the point with some humor to lighten things up. This is unlike some other books that have heavy use humor to fill pages and pages of nonsense. The book provides info on all tags, code writing styles, organization, and image coloring and optimization and some other extra items."
3,"Easy to comprehend, helpful","Easy to read, this book sits next to my computer and serves as my constant reference. Easy to read and comprehend. Thanks!"
5,Great! (but error on p.176),"I liked this book so well I assigned it to my intro to web design class. These Visual Quickstart Guides are really great to learn from. FYI: p. 176, the </FRAMESET> tag goes AFTER the </NOFRAMES> tag. Peachpit is a great press, but they need more tech editors! Code errors shouldn't sneak through in a book teaching code."
3,"Very usable and informative, but more Mac oriented than PC.",This was a good book that takes a step by step view of how to do things in HTML. The examples are understandable and usable. The only draw back is that the screen shots are Mac oriented. Would have been useful to know up front. Mac and Windows screen don't necessarily have the same menu options in the same place. Can be misleading if you aren't prepared for it. Overall content is useful.
4,Nice and easy to get to what you need to read about.,"Very easy format for getting right to what you want to see without a lot of page-turning. I especially like the examples, both in HTML and in the browser. I recommend it whole-heartedly."
5,Excellent Book,I have become a fan of the Visual Quick Start Series ever since I went through this book. If you are new to HTML then you should definitely buy this book. HTML is a language which is pretty intuntive and best taught by giving plenty of examples and avoiding too much theory. Elizabeth Castro accomplishes this and I found this book so interesting and to the point that I finished it in just two sittings. It is also a quick and easy reference once you are done reading it.
5,Best reference - Best resource - Best book to learn HTML,"Great book! I had just begun an adult course on HTML. I bought this and it helped clarify what I was learning and introduced concepts clearly. It also comes with a color chart with thier 6-digit codes to be used as backgrounds. Chapters are short, clear and easy to understand with visuals step-by-step. Anyone can learn. If you are interested in Web Page Design and learning more, pick up JavaScript For the World Wide Web, Visual Quickstart Guide 3rd Edition."
4,Great Overview in a Small Package,"Not much has been written on this topic (other than Microsoft Whitepapers, and some recent magazine articles). I have an n-tiered project coming up in July, and thought it would be a good idea to get an overview of the technologies Microsoft is offering.Although I wish it delved into greater detail (code snippets, etc.) this is a great book to get a good overview about the Windows DNA framework. I was originally spending hours scouring the Microsoft site for this information, but now I have it in one quick reference."
4,Nice reference and great caricatures,"I have really found this book to be exceptionally well written and honest - it does not try to hide the fact that authors such as Grisham and King are more or less commercial writers and not truly what we would or should consider contemporary authors.After finishing, or in the middle of a novel, I usually read the authors bio in this reference guide. I also really enjoy at the end of each bio there is a section that mentions what authors are similar and/or describe what other authors were influenced based of his/her work. By the book if you are interested in reading."
3,this cd was a disappointment,"i bought this cd for ""save tonight"" and ""falling in love."" as it happens, those two are the only good songs on the entire cd. if you don't mind spending your money for two songs, go ahead, because those two are great, but the rest suck."
3,Almost all the songs are very good.,"Almost all the songs are very good, and after saying that, you're probably wondering why I gave it three stars. Well, I don't particularly like When Mermaids Cry. I think it is sort of stupid. The songs that stand out are Save Tonight, Shooting Up In Vain, and Permanent Tears. Some of the others are good, except most of them sound just like the others. Hard to tell the dif."
4,gotta love this,"I first heard of eagle eye cherry while I was watching Dawsons Creek, the song ""save tonight"" came on and I knew I had to have this cd. The rest of this cd is so great its a one-of-a-kind. Even if you never heard of these people I bet you would like them!"
1,"Awful, awful, awful....","This album is not worth buying. I loved Save tonight, but the rest of the songs are terrible. I wish I could get my money back..... what a waste!"
4,"""SAVE"" your money!!","""Save Tonight"" is good, but don't waste your money like I did on the entire CD. After track 1, the rest of it is sappy and like wet bread-a turn off!"
5,Eagle Eye Cherry.. Worth your money!,"This CD is great, I admit I bought it just for Save tonight, but it turned out to be a good bargain. It has one of my favorite songs on it, ""When Mermaids Cry"" is a really good song. His lyrics are real and understandable. His music is catchy and actually fun to listen to. It's a great CD!"
3,The Carl Stalling Project Volume 2,"More music from Warner Brother Cartoons 1936 to 1958.Carl Stalling was one of the foremost composers of music for cartoons and wrote virtually all of the scores for Warner Brothers cartoons from 1936 to 1958. This is a compilation of some complete soundtracks and other snippets. In my opinion, this disk is not quite as well done as ""The Carl Stalling Project Volume I."""
1,"WHOA, WHOA - What the HELL is this?!?!?!?!?","I got to this by clicking on a link to (supposedly) an mp3 download version of ""Stone Free,"" the Hendrix tribute disc featuring names like Paul Rodgers, Seal, Jeff Beck - instead, this is some piece of dreck called ""Tribute to Jimi Hendrix,"" It features NO ONE of note, and is credited only to ""Studio Group!"" Amazon, please fix this; I've had only good service from you, and I hope this is only an error. BUYER BEWARE."
2,Experience Disappointments,"Clapton's version of Stone Free is actually better than the original (I know, blasphemy...), and Paul Rodgers comes out unscathed, but most of the rest of this album is, well, crap."
4,Great pan for the price,I needed a large skillet for bacon and eggs and this fit the bill nicely. I can cook 5 to 6 eggs at one time and no sticking when it comes time to flip them. And the price was great! I would definitely recommend this.
5,"MY ONLY ""KEEPER"" FROM THE SERIES---","This story was more centered on the mystery instead of bogged down in family triteness and though the humor was not often, it was still there. A religious hillbilly snake handling congregation certainly was an interesting change of pace. My only complaint was that the villain was a bit too obvious so there was no surprise ending.Both sisters were constantly involved, keeping it from becoming one-sided and dull. It also did not contain the multiple going-nowhere subplots that weighed most of the other books down. This was not only an enjoyable tale with an unusual theme and characters, but the only volume out of an eight book series that I actually kept."
4,Very inspiring and uplifting. Great gift!,It feels good to know that even illustrious women share the same headaches that we mere mortals do!
3,quazi cultish but alot of info too,"I haven't finished the book yet. I can tell you though that the first chapter is filled with religious jargon of a Christian nature, but referring to some other version of the Bible. I'd never heard of this Church before and I didn't buy the book in order to be indoctrinated in someone's religion! However, reading past that part I've come to some useful ideas and information regarding nutrition...which, after all IS why I bought the book :) So far, I think the purchase was worth it. I just ignore the religious instruction."
5,Works great in our 2010 Jeep Grand Cherokee,"These mats fit perfectly, do not move around, and are easy to clean. The material seems to have the right balance between slick plastic and grabbing rubber. Unlike some mats, they cover the area where the driver's left foot rests, but the right flange could be taller to keep the right side of the driver's foot off the carpet when it's on the gas pedal."
1,Inverter - NO Posts!,"What a peice of crap!There are no posts on the back of this inverter, only holes with set screws. So you can't buy a regular set of cables and screw them on. Instead they send you a set of their ""special connectors"" so you can spend your time building your own cables."
2,Not worth it's money,very bad metal quality. Easy oxidize with white patina after every wash. First few grounded peaces always have black color.Not worth buying.
3,Nice looking but not as comfortable as expected,These shoes are true to size and look very nice on. I recieved a few compliments on them as well. You can tell that they are made very well too. I was just under the impression that they would be comfortable for long wearing. The first few days they felt great but then they started to bother my feet. I purchased these in wide too! I still wear them but just not everyday. I must say that I do love the height though.
2,For benchrest shooters only,"This book is definitly for benchrest shooters only. It does not live up to its name of the ""Ultimate"" because it only addresses one area. Many more stories than useful information. Would not recommend for the average recreational shooter or hunter."
2,For competitive shooters only.,"If you really want to get into bench shooting then get this book. If you want to know about accurizing rifles, better shooting techniques and sighting then forget about it. I think the 'hunting' part was thrown in to get this book sold at Wal-Mart.For every item I found useful I had to wade through page after page of competitive bench jargon. For instance the chapter on shooting technique was mostly about selecting a rest and punching '0.xx' inch groups by moving the sandbag under the stock. Not to mention that every picture in this book is of some competitive shooter with a rifle and most seem to be from the 1980's."
4,A comprehensive book for the competition benchrest shooter.,"Glenn Newick wrote a complete and comprehensive work on the sport of competitive benchrest shooting. There are several chapters that will interest the average gun enthusiast, but in general it is a sport specific book. Overall it was worth the price of admission."
4,This is a MICROCOSM of SMILE!!!!,"Well they've done it again.... this album is groungbreaking modern Americana, without all the pressure of the 60's psychedelic era... (1995) Wilson still sounds great.... Parks [as always] writes and composes with the type of credibilty that continues to STUN the Western World!!!!And U know I'm Right... This is is a tiny Microcosm of Smile And its tremendendous!!!!!! Anyone that that claims they know Americana music.... is A LIAR.... until they understand the VDP... BRIAN W collabortation!!!! Hitherto we figure out retroactively what ORANGE CRATE ART is...?????? cuz We didnt know what SMILE was?!!!!We are going to put Parks into the Rock N Roll hall of fame where he belongs... his ideas of Americana are unparalleled... SMILE tells the orig. story... Orange Crate Art Finishes it off...... So to quote AC/DC who also sung about Americana ""STICK THAT IN YOUR FUSEBOX""!!!""SUN UP AND SAIL AWAY"""
2,Made in mexico,Dissapointed. i just bought a 2nd bosch bulldog. my first one bought 4 years ago through the orange store was made in germany. this one is made in mexico... i wonder if its going to last...
2,Replace Carbon Brush is not user friendly,"I love the tool, it never disappointed me, but after many usages, the pair of carbon brushes worn out and needed to be replaced, and it is not easy. It should and 'MUST' be easy as replacing a screw from the outside not from opening the body parts and it could end up damaging the expensive tool for a five dollar parts. Tools designers should always thinks of small but important things in designing for a long haul."
1,Buyer Beware,"I purchased the LGVX4650 emergency cell phone charger and it arrived in a plastic sandwich-type baggie. There were no instructions included and the product had no markings on it. My original reaction was that this could have been a used/refurbished item. Since I was giving this as a gift, I was concerned with the lack of packaging.When I wrote to Gomadic, they implied that I was stupid and why would any one need instructions to operate this product. The customer service rep claimed no other competitors gave packaging or operating instructions. Does anyone know if products of this type come without instructions and packaging?"
3,Crack Lawyers? Nope .. just lawyers on crack ..,"Forget about passing the bar. This take is more about passing the bong.The narrative seems to be:""We are hot @#$%. We got into Harvard and Stanford Law School, respectively. Once there, our energies were focused on how to do the least amount of work and ingest the maximum amount of booze and drugs.""""We are cool. We have orgies. We rarely even go to class. But, we are so brilliant, we still finished Cum Laude.""A tale like this I might have found amusing at age 23 or 33. Being a codger/geezer at age 53, knowing there are many students who would give an anatomical part to enter either of these schools, this tale seems like a sad and dispiriting waste of time and effort. It's not funny or cute any more.Depressing...."
2,Pretty bad movie,"It seems that this movie is part of the political culture of todays Russia, namely, of fictious romantisicm and adulation of Russian humanism during bad time- II WW.Actors, who are supposed to play heros of underage thiefs and killers, look too intelligent for that role. Their trainers seem to humanistic, dialogs too soft and situations too banal, to make the viewer believe that this is about a past reality."
5,Great Book!,Dot to Dot like you've never seen before. I bought this book for a child who loves dot to dot puzzles and this book is nothing but dot to dots. Plus the pictures are really great and challenging for 4-6 yr olds.
4,nice book,"big fat, nice edition. lots of tales. would be nice to keep on a shelf to read to your grandkids, one day."
3,"Didn't look pristine, adhesive tape attached to the watch clasp","Although the pulsar watch I've ordered was a brand new one, it did not seem pristine with adhesive tape attached to the clasp, I was not satisfied with the look and feel of it."
3,A little awkward!,"The gasket cement is a great sealer. the problem is the applicator. It is too big for the bottle. When you pull it out, the cement runs down the bottle. I don't know why not just have a little brush like the aviation sealer. This is the only drawback. just kind of pull it out easy and swirl around the neck of the bottle so the excess stays in the bottle. otherwise it is good sealer."
5,enjoyable comeback recording,"I really enjoy listening to this CD. I have been a fan for a long time, and I think he has made a great comeback after 10yrs. Receiving the Grammy for this album was well deserved and long over due."
3,On safe ground,"The first listnings was fab but later on this sounds a little too safe. John Fogerty takes no risks here. Its not the same adventure as his best work. Nowdays I play it not so often hence the lack of surprises. If this record was with an other artist the rate would have been higher but I expect more from Mr Creedence. (Its not easy John, I know!)"
4,"Comeback, part 2.","Another comeback for Fogerty. This one has great production, and good songs. His guitar playing has improved (though it was always good to me) as the songs on here are rock and country with a little blues thrown in. ""A Hundred and Ten in the Shade"" is one of the best songs he has done. This is a very consistant CD, with no real clunkers on here. My only minor complaint is the songwriting, which isn't nearly as good as what he has done in the past, either with CCR or solo. It's not that it's bad, it's just generic and I've never thought of him as a generic songwriter. But still, a great Grammy-winning CD."
5,Great!,"I absolutly ADORE HOLLYWELL STABLES! Its one of my most fave series! The way that Ms Alexander writes them, its as if you are right there along with Mel, Ross, Blake, Rocky, Katie, and the others! I would recommend Hollywell Stables to any one of any age that is Horse and Pony Mad! Way to go Ms Alexander!"
2,Very Broad Overview,"I bought this book because I am an income tax preparer. I was disappointed. This book gives a very broad overview of every tax imposed by NYS, e.g., sales, gasoline, excise, tobacco, liquor, etc. The information on income taxes is very sketchy and less helpful than what is in New York's income tax form instructions. I was hoping for in-depth analysis. This book did not have it."
5,Meow says the Tarot Kitty,"This deck is wonderfully funny and sweet without being cloying. It does a good job of capturing the excitement of small-town Halloween when a child could still accept home-made treats in her goodie bag. And I love the funky black cat who appears in each card, sometimes as a participant, sometimes as an observer. If you liked Nighmare Before Christmas, you'll probably like this deck.I'm usually not a fan of theme decks, finding that most of them end up in the back of the bookcase after the initial excitement has worn off. West obviously has a pretty good tarot knowledge base as well as her excellent art skills. This deck actually works. Any reader familiar with the Rider-Waite would be able to use this deck with minimal study."
1,Sharp and pointey combs,Ouch! It really hurts to comb your hair with this implement. Maybe a sharpened rake would be better. Wow. I mean it.
4,Western Canada's Cottage Magazine,"I've been getting Cottage for the last 6 years and have fond this magazine to be an excellent resource for any recreational property owner.The great thing about Cottage is it's based in Western Canada and the features are often close to 'Home'Some of the regular contributors are Shell Busey's column, Inroads - new products and Rural route - letters from the readers.Solar, off grid and sustainability just a few of my favourite topics. The tool review is always a favourite."
5,"good quality, for teens and those with small hands","These gloves fit me perfectly. I have pretty small hands. My palm is about 3 inches wide. If I stretch my fingers out, the distance from thumb to pinky is about 6 and 3/4 inches. Measuring from base of palm to tip of middle finger, my hand is 6 and 1/2 inches long. If your hand has much larger dimensions then these, these gloves probably won't fit. Note: all boxing gloves need some time to be broken in. They won't feel fully comfortable until you've spent some good time breaking them in. They are very good quality for their price range. I just do bag work for a kickboxing workout. If you want to do actual boxing, you might want a heavier glove (heavier = more padding). Great product!"
3,Great for new young boxers,"I purchased these for a 9 year old who is new to the sport. I did buy small hand wraps and put these gloves on him. I thought they were a tight fit but the kid said it felt fine on him. He had no pain, felt good to him, and was very happy with them. Its not a bad product just wish the velcro strap was longer. For what it is and for beginers this is a good buy."
5,A unique work of genius,"I remember getting this album when it first came out, a bit nervously. And when Speedway ended I jumped up and cheered in an empty room, unable to stop myself. It wasn't the Smiths. It didn't matter.The sound and the lyrics are strange, detached -- Morrissey tells the stories but doesn't live in them the way he did on Meat is Murder, for example -- and yet compelling. The professional outsider tells his stories with sympathy and intelligence and passion. We end with the most affecting moment of closeness anywhere in Morrissey's work: ""In my own sick way/I've always stayed true to you."" I still listen to it, and it still makes me want to stand up and cheer."
5,His best solo record,"Although I have not heard Ringleader yet, I'm pretty sure Vauxhall will remain his best album. It is a ""solid"" record, meaning that it doesn't have a single weak track. Every song is perfect lyrically and instrumentally, and the melodies of each song go together somehow, giving this album a feeling of cohesion. Some of his most wonderful songs are on here, including the grand ""Now My Heart Is Full"" and ""Speedway,"" and of course ""The More You Ignore Me, The Closer I Get, "" which was so good it actually made it briefly to mainstream American radio back when it came out in 94."
3,The beginning of the end?,"While not necessarily unlistenable, this was nowhere near the quality of the previous, Your Arsenal. ""My Heart is Full,"" and ""The More You Ignore Me"" are the few great tracks while the rest of the album attempts perky popness while coming off palid and boring. Phone home, my man."
1,Wish I Could Give It No Stars,"We ordered pedometers on three separate occasions and ended up with three separate pedometers. This model is useless. The buttons usually don't work, the mileage is WAY off -- by hundreds of miles! I can't get mine to reset. We urge you to try other models."
4,works great once you get the knack,"took me a few tries to get the knack for using this, but once I did, it works great every time.I have chickens and ducks and really fresh home-grown eggs are harder to peel than the ones you get at the store. I typcially lose half the white clinging to the shell. this very clever peeler uses air to separate the egg from the shell giving a perfectly clean peeled egg every time!things that help when you first try this: 1) make sure the egg is well chilled before peeling. 2) make sure you get a clean hole through one end, all the way through the shell. 3) get a good crackle on the other end. 4) once you set the egg on the stand and put the bellows part over the top, press down with a sharp, quick, firm action and POP! out the bottom comes a perfectly clean egg! I love this thing!"
2,Egg gone wild,Well I was having a hard time peeling eggs. So I seen this on Rachel Ray and I order one. Well I went thru a dozen of eggs and came up with only eggs good for egg salad. Maybe I don't have enough muscle to push down . But at this price I wouldn't reconmend it.
5,i think anyone who enjoys this artist should check tut this,"if you like the artist surely you'll like this cd. The new version of nothing compares 2 u is excellent. Rosie Gaines definetly makes the song. I like the idea of re releasing all the old songs on a new cd, it gives you a chance to buy th e songs you like rather than having to buy 6 cd's with songs you don't care to hear. If you liked this cd I would recomend checking out the other 2 greatest hits cds. Also I would recomend checking out sign o' times & alphabet st. cds. If you like his oid music, you should give crystal ball a go too!!! This is 1 of the most talented artists today. He plays every instrument you hear on his cds. I definetly think this cd is worthy of a 5!!"
3,Some Interesting Facts but As a Whole Disappointing,"Perhaps I misread the description of this book. I found the Churchill visit and the negotiations interesting, but from the descriptions I had read of the volume I was expecting not only a narrative about the goings-on in Washington, but stories about how ordinary people reacted to the declaration of war, how the city and country changed, etc.I feel I must comment about one thing I found very disconcerting: apparently no one proofread or spellchecked this manuscript. I saw numerous, jarring typos and several places where words were left out, so that I had to reread the sentence several times to try to make out what was being said. Very sloppy in such a heavily researched and scholarly book; did they rush it to the publisher in order to meet a deadline?"
4,Pretty Good,Even though it's full of really great ideas and tips. I would like to see some works that she has done for Non-Destiny's Child people.
3,"Good, but alot of it makes me sleepy...","I have yet to listen to this entire album, as I fall asleep towards the end of disc 1...Thats not to say my sleep is peaceful, the eerie music is haunting, and will stay with you, even when you sleep.I honestly don't know of anyother CD thats given me a nightmare before... so this CD has to be good, plus it comes in a neat double disc case thats the size of 1 normal case!!!"
5,smarter than you think,"surreal haunting spacemusic. euphoric minimalist perfection. pop music murderer. this is what's on god's ipod. this album can only be fully comprehended during a 300mg ketamine trip, for you will not grasp it's power any other way. you must be completely removed from earthly influence to drink from it's nectar. dismiss it/me as crazy or stupid if you like, but richard has indeed stumbled upon the truth."
3,don't believe the hype,"Granted, this is dark, beautiful and lovely music but most certianly it is not Richard's best work (see I Care Because You Do for that). Why people are hyping this as the best aphex twin release is beyond me. Track 1 and 4 on disc one are amazing and I really like disc two a lot but at times this music is montonous, drony and not very interesting. It's soothing to listen to while in bed, reading or just puttering around the house but overall nothing leaps out and grabs you. This has been done before by other artists years before Richard did it. Check out Chris + Cosey's Elemental 7, same atmospehrics, textures and dark moods. Of course it sounds a bit primitive by today's standards given the fact that their release was made around 1983 but at that time it really WAS cutting edge. aphex twin in comparison is a novelty. I love apehx twin and what Richard is capable of doing with electronic music but really this isn't his best. His best music is more interesting than this."
2,unusual Aphex Twin,"I own a lot of Aphex Twin albums and I have to say that this is my least favourite. The first ambient works release is a classic, but I feel that this is over-rated and lacking. I just don't understand the hype over this. I don't even like to call it minimal or ambient. Maybe this CD is better fit for stoners.Update: It is starting to grow on me. I'd give it 4 stars now."
5,What they said,"All that I would say has been said; I just wanted to contribute to the number of 5 star ratings. This is in the ""desert island"" collection (one of those few albums you would want with you on a desert island, assuming you had a lifetime supply of batteries).Give this a few listenings and you will see that indeed the brain has been wired to process music and emotions in the same region."
3,OK,"The book is ok. It offers a series of exercises and advise that you will find in a dozen books. The book is well presented, logically laid out and easy to follow."
5,As close as you can get to being there - without the bruises,"Documenting the fast pace action of a tournament of this nature is no easy feat. The camera work and editing of this DVD really puts the audience in the seat of the action. Not only did I enjoy the tournament footage itself, but also the interviews with the contestants."
3,A long slog through a very sad life,"This is not a bad book, but it's not one to pick up lightly. It is essentially a long walk through a very dark childhood, with only intermittent glimpses of hope and light. Nearly all of those glimpses get squashed, including a very obvious hope that gets squashed because of a bureaucrat's racism.What the book does not do is tell the tale beyond the sadness. Assuming that this is a truthful memoir, the author moved from the horrific, nearly hopeless story told here to a happier future in which she managed to become a published author. How did that happen? How did she overcome? What changed in her life? Where did she find her strength? You'll never learn from reading this.It is worth reading as an illustration of what is unfortunately a very real kind of life that most would prefer to pretend did not exist. But a great book, it is not."
4,Interesting relic of the cold war,"I do like Dick Francis novels, and I do admit, as many other reviewers have said, that there is a certain predictability to the plots of many of them. What I find myself looking for, in mancy cases, is the philosophy beyond the plot. In this case, the plot is about an attempt to sabotage the Moscow Olympics. The plot holds together well, but what I enjoyed about this book is that it is a glimpse of the end of cold war Russia (of course from a British perspective) and it is an attempt to think about the personal decisions that humans make which shape of our lives and about personal freedom.I think Francis does a good job with these rather weighty themes, within the framework of the mystery/thriller genre that he has perfected over time."
3,Giving Francis a trial run,"This is the first Dick Francis novel I've read. It was okay. Not brilliant, but entertaining enough to keep me turning pages. To me it seemed more spy story than mystery, but that is probably due to the fact that the action takes place in the USSR. It was a nice change of pace from the traditional English cozies I usually go for. Based on the strength of this book, I'll be reading more Dick Francis in the future."
5,awesome book,this book is exteremely helpful in every aspect of team roping. i've applied some of the exercises to my horses and myself. my ropin has significantly improved
3,Overrated,"This is a good rockumentary (better than a Behind The Music), not a great film.More live footage would have made it better."
2,Not suitable for king-single or slat bed,"We bought this bedrail in a box branded as ""Compass"" but once opened found that it had ""First Years"" logos all over it. We were hoping to use it for a King Single size bed, but it doesn't fit. I didn't find this out until well into the assembly/installation instructions. They could easily add some more holes to make it fit. I was ready to drill some extra holes myself but then found out it also isn't suitable for a slat bed, so back to the shop it went. If we had known it was ""First Years"" we could have found online reviews and known that it wasn't suitable. It would be nice if they had clearer information on the packaging about what types of beds it is and isn't suitable for.Assembly was painful, they could easily pre-assemble parts of it without significantly increasing the package size."
5,An overlooked classic and great insight into twin psychology,"I'm a twin and i have never read a book that captured the trauma of becoming an adult and needing to separate from your twin so well. I was really surprised to read in Baker's bio that she was not a twin! She gets it. I would have loved this book for that even if it wasn't so well written, but its masterful fiction as well. The setting and tone reminds me of Joan Didion's Run River, fans of hers will appreciate this, but its got the detailed psychological penetration of Elizabeth Bowen."
4,viejas series,"Es curioso ver estas series de los años 40, entretenidas y creadas con ilusión, me informan de otra época, otra forma de hacer series de TV en aquellos años."
4,Nice deluxe version,"This is a really nice deluxe version of this documental. The material is perfect, but the digibook is different from the european version. This one has a shiny cover. The UK version has 30 pages on the book and this one 24."
2,Editing is retarded,"This is possibly the worst-edited concert video I've ever seen.Okay, here's a question. If the guitarist is taking a solo, do you put the camera on:a) the guitarb) backstagec) some chick's pierced tongued) the bathroom attendante) a random sequence of all of the aboveGet a clue, guys."
3,No big deal,"Given teh great opportunity given the camera crew, this DVD dissapoints. It's indeed a little bit ""shallow"", in the sense that the guys really don't open themselves. But, this was not intended to be ""SOME KIND OF MONSTER"", so, in general, it achieves its goal: to give a brief glimpse of Iron Maiden on tour.Well, at least Samallwood admits that Janick Gers ""never plays the same thing twice"" and ""the guys sometimes look at him and aks what are you doing?"".It achieves its goal. But this goal simply do not interest me much."
1,"Returned it, new one defective too","The main problem I had with this is the batteries... when using regular AA batteries, I could only take one or two pictures before they went dead. (The manual says you get WAY more pictures than that even from regular batteries.)I called HP, and they replaced it with another. That lasted for seven or eight months, then started killing batteries after one picture again. This is a serious problem and probably why they don't manufacture it anymore. At this point the camera's unusable, the second one to blow up on me. Don't buy it."
3,Good but not Great,The power retention of this battery is half as much as the original battery. Many of the replacement batteries do not measure up to the performance of the original batteries.
3,Satisfactory Service,"I received the battery which seems to be working fine. No problems and it is holding a charge. However, the item took forever to ship (over 8 business days) that was my only quirk."
5,Battery saved me from buying a new phone,Brand new cell phone battery for .51 cents. It works perfectly and saved me $$ on a battery from an electronics store and $$$ on a new phone. So what if I paid 4.50 for shipping. Great deal!
3,School Assignment,"I recommend this book to other readers between the ages of 8 to 13 year-old kids because the book talks about fun things like time travel and also is easy to read. Some of the words in the book are big, though."
3,Chocolate Brown - Not Tan,I needed a tan color. The online color looks tan. The product is a deep chocolate brown. I have not used it yet.
3,Nice tarps but pricey,"I'd really thought for the price these would be thicker / heavier than they are. You may be better off going to a local tool or hardware store. Originally I'd planned to use them for protecting bikes, but am not certain they'll hold up to the winds. As tarps go - ok, but you can get more for your money elsewhere."
5,Real Fine Tunes,"I recently saw John Hiatt at the Mountain Winery in Saratoga, Cali and I was blown away by his amazing ability to weave something unique and interesting into every single song. His Greatest Hits CD is incredible and highly recommended for music lovers who can appreciate a diverse, soulful, playful, authentic, creative, unique, artistic, song writer-musician who is seriously in a class of Brilliant that few musicians ever come close to. I even thought he was a better singer now than he was 10 years ago, as there was something exquisite, rare, and beautiful in his voice that has stayed with me for days. He is in a class all by himself."
3,Biased but still useful,"this book, as others have pointed out, is biased and tends to ""beat up"" on caucasians at times. it still has some useful clinical information and practice considerations, however. ponterotto et al's *handbook of multicultural counseling* is another, probably more comprehensive and practical, resource for working with diverse patients in my experience. nonetheless, sue and sue have written a good, well-organized text. the most useful parts are the guidelines for approaching the patient in the first interview (broken down into various cultures with individual considerations)."
5,"Nice album, worth the purchase","I originally bought this album because I heard ""Sideral"" at my work place and liked the beat. I had never heard the song before so I just wrote down the lyrics and found out who sung it. At first I was skeptical on just getting just that one song but the review on this site (As well as the ones I found on the apple store) made me decide to get the whole album. For 8.99 it's a great deal. Awesome songs.Personal favorites: Sideral, Fast Lane, Somos Luz, Con la Mano Levanta, Bajo el Mismo Sol and Son Son. Although I like the whole disc in general. Listen to the song previews and get it if you enjoy artists like Shakira, Mana, Julieta Venegas, Juanes and the like."
4,C9 is hot,"Great debut recording. Can't wait to hear more from this band in the future. Perfect blend of hip hop, soul, and r&b. This album always gets the party started"
2,Chutzpah,"Being an idle chap, I spend far too much time reading these reviews. A fav activity is to read some of the nonsense written about terrible albums. Why find out what someone thinks of Ok Computer, when I can find someone to praise steaming piles of doo-da like this?First of all, it's not a bad collection of songs. The album itself is rather good. But the idea of doing a copy of the original CD, 6 MONTHS after it was released blows my mind. The only possible rational is that things were getting a little tight around Maison Mode and they needed some extra dough to help out with their, ahem, medical expenses.Not that DM have ever been shy about cashing in. The 'In Your Room' single from this CD was one of the very first 3-Part CD singles. I remember seeing it in my local HMV in Brighton barely believing my eyes. Of course, now look on ebay and that same collection is now going for $20 (for each CD!)."
1,There are no illustrations in this book,"Surprisingly, this is a book on pictorial composition that completely omits inclusion of any examples of the works he analyses. Unless you happen to have copies of the works he covers on hand, you will find this of very little use."
4,Great iPod Case,"The iSkin has served me very well so far. It looks cool, and it keeps my iPod very well protected. The click wheel works normally through the skin. I only have two minor problems with it. The first thing is that the hold slider is a little tricky to move while in the case. It takes a little while to get used to. My second difficulty with this product is existent while using a3.5MM Plug To Rca/video Cablewith the iPod. The 3.5MM plug does not stay all the way in most of the time, meaning the video on a TV can become very jittery. Typically when I use this cable, I just pull over that section of the skin and insert the plug directly.Overall, this is still a great product. I recommend it. It's much better than the multitude of other iPod skins I've seen."
4,Durable case with crystal clear front,"This is a really great iPod case, much better than my last. The plastic on the front is very clear, which is great for watching videos. It's also very durable and well-made. I would definitely recommend this case to anyone with an iPod Video. I only wish the front part that covers the screen was recessed so that it wouldn't get as scratched up."
5,Gunna Buy Another,This handle is a fine punctuation to my WC experience. Looks nice and easy throw. Worth the price. An important and satisfying detail that daily affirms itself as a smart buy.PS:Generally not available at the big box stores. They sell the cheaper easy-to-break toilet gear.
4,Whats your problem? it was good!,"well i like candlebox because i like rock groups that can actually sing, to bad grunge died out to hard core.to me candlebox is one of the few breaths of fresh air between the lound and discordant alternative of today.the critics are really ragging o them but personaly i cant see why."
5,simple useage that makes things safe,"I needed a well built, functional torque wrench to check the wheel lugs on my 5th wheel camper, and this one foots the bill. It is easy to use and seems to be very accurate.Thanks!"
4,Great Value for the occasional mechanic,"I got this torque wrench specifically for axle spindle nuts on my Jeep, but because of the large torque range on it have been able to use it for a number of different applications. It works like a charm, and while not built for day-after-day professional use, it is also priced at only a fraction of the fully professional tools.Particularly for someone like me, who only needs the torque wrench on rare occasions, but really needs one then, this tool is the perfect, inexpensive solution."
2,think its second rate,"think it is uncalibrated and could perform alot better,wish i woulda went with a knon makerguess ya live n learn"
4,Tekton Torque Wrench,I was looking for a quality torque wrench for limited use. The Tekton torque wrench I found on Amazon has been the right choice. The price was great andthe quality very good. If you need this tool for your personal use this won't break your budget and does the job.
1,"I hate to be ""That Guy""",Im sure if the item actually worked it would have been wonderful.But lets start with the things that were obviously wrong.- It was missing external screws ( no biggie...)- Upon moving the case - it rattled closer inspection -- internal board screws fell out.- Upon even further inspection - the board was actually ZIP TIED down to the case ( so much for grounding )- Rear outlet panel where plugs attached moved and slid around the back.- I can not be certain but it looks as though this product was used!!- Because OF APC ( not plethora7 who i did not contact) wonderful customer service both before and afterthe sale I will be buying another. But I will again check the internal serial numbers to make sure thatit is not a re manufactured / rebuilt aka used power conditioner.
2,disappointed,"It was recommended to me, but unfortunately it only partially conceals a sun spoton my cheek.I viewed a you tube video to be sure I was applying it correctly, and I was. Oh well !"
1,Author: poor skills,"In Bob Lovka's book there is a dedication to a well known NOT REPUTABLE rescue group. Currently the publisher has been made aware of this and is recalling all books to remove that page. By purchasing this book you are supporting animal abuse. Be smart, voice your opinions to the publisher."
1,ONLY works if the eyeglasses are flat,"If you use curved sunglasses to provide side protection for your eyes the Third Eye Bicycle Mirror is worthless. The problem is with the basic design. When the section is mounted on the temple of a pair of glasses it must be behind where the temple pivots. At this point the arm for the mirror extends forward only 1-1/4 inches. It will work on aviation style sunglasses but really who bicycles with this type of eyewear?The company, Bicycles Safety Inc., should have provided a longer arm, about 2 inches longer, which would have enabled the Third Eye Bicycle Mirror to work on both flat (by moving it further back along the temple) and curved sunglasses."
5,Insightful text on COIN,I found this book to be very insightful. I enjoyed it thoroughly. I will recommend this book to anyone who wishes to expand their understanding on COIN Operations and definitely to those preparing to deploy for missions in Iraq or Afghanistan.
3,Amazing Apple Cider Vinegar,"Vinegar has been around in one form or another for at least 10,000 years. `Amazing Apple Cider Vinegar' puts it into perspective, as the ancient fermented juice goes on expose in different food preparation throughout the ages, and including its other non-culinary uses."
3,Too easy a listen,"All titles are well-crafted and cleanly executed, but for my taste they are somewhat too polished. I chose this CD because of Joe Sample's Crusaders past, but it isn't nearly as earthy as for example Scratch. In particular, the instrumental version of Street Life is disappointing and lacks originality. However, if you like easy listening with a funky touch, this album might well please you."
4,A great informative book!,"I really like this book. It's a very informative about some of the most important sires in Arabian horse breeding.As an Arabian horse owner, I wouldn't want to be without this book in my collection.I very much enjoy reading about the horses behind the the famous names and show results, the REAL horses, their special hallmarks and what their owner/trainers remembers about them. Special memories.And being from Sweden, I am of course very proud to see one Swedish bred stallion, Alladdin, among the legends!I just wish there would have been colored pictures, that would have made the difference to a five star rating.I highly recommend this book!"
4,Good fast introduction to chemical sensitivity,"This is a short book, that is good for introducing you to MCS (Multiple Chemical Sensitivity), so you can determine if you might have it. It gives an idea on how complicated this disease is, some of the multiple ways you can get it, and some of the possible cures. Recommended."
2,Not nearly what I expected,"This book could have been so much better. This is one of the most popular German lager styles to brew, yet the authors suggest the use of Belgian and crystal malts in place of the standard Munich malt which is used by all Bavarian breweries. Definitely the most disappointing book in the series."
3,"Oktovberfest, Vienna, Marzen","This book does a good job of explaining the style and history of this beer style(s), but is somewhat dated. Since this book came out, the home brewing practices and equipment have changed significantly, and it would be nice to see the book reflect that. Overall this book is worth owning because there is not much literature about Oktoberfest, Vienna, and Marzen beers."
1,What is wrong with you people?!!,"This has got to be the worst T.V show/cartoon in the history of entertainment! The powerpuffs are just these three lil' skanks that don't ver save the world but a potsmokin city called Townesville, and that's only the beginning. The mayor is a complete jerk and should NOT be in office to begin with! Why don't they just impeach that old midget? Secondly, what is with the decapitated miss Belum? She does not have a face obviously becuase they couldn't think up one to put on her! Third, the fight scenes are just cheesy cheesy cheesy! (I've seen MORE action in a ""Popeye"" cartoon!) OH YEAH! Shouldn't the government be holding the chemical X formula for observation besides some laboratory Professor? It just does'nt make any sense! Craig Mccracken has gone downhill since this was aired! He should have stuck to his masterpieces, ""2 Stupid Dogs"" and ""Dexter's Lab"" instead because those shows were at least funny, compared to this garbage! I mean, what happened here????"
4,Reliable,"I have had this product for ~3 years. It has done quite a good job in this time, evenly heating and being reliable. The only thing i don't like about this product is that it has relatively short slats. While they are wide enough for bagels, they are too short for even slightly long pieces of bread. Although I do enjoy the ability to hit the bread push button hard and the toast ends up on my plate.Unfortunately after these 3 years, 3 moves, and a lot of use, it has started to go down hill. I keep having to up the browning setting to get it to acceptable heating. I will probobly need to get another toaster soon unfortunately. Since I like to eat a lot of handmade breads I will probobly try to get a toaster with a longer slot."
3,Not for one slice,This toaster has some good qualities and features. The one I was looking for is not on this model. I wanted a toaster that can toast evenly on both sides with one slice of bread. The Avante does no better than cheaper toasters.
2,Iffy Product,"I bought 4 of these toasters as gifts, and two of them has had issues and two of them are okay(?). I have yet to hear back from the two other individuals.The electrical working of the toaster seems to go haywire and start burning. The product is manufactured in China, and I don't know what kind of quality check processes they instill."
2,The worst book in the series,"I was very disappointed when I was finished reading ""Revenge of the Wannabes."" When I read the previous books in the Clique, I was quite excited to read the third book. I thought it was going to be good. Despite the series' shallow and snobby characters, the last two books were good, and I liked them. But wow, this book was a big disappointment.It really had no story to it. The big story to ""Revenge of the Wannabes"" was Alicia breaking away from Massie and her crew and starting her own clique. Of course, nobody breaks away from Massie and tries to make a new clique. Let's just say it wasn't as easy to go about making this new clique as Alicia thought it would be.That was basically the whole book. I was terribly bored with book, and it took me a while to read it, when with the others books, it took me two hours, maybe less. My advice to you: don't waste your time with this book, it's not worth it."
3,Not Bad,"The book isn't bad, but it isn't good. It is enjoyable, but it is also cheesy and unrealistic. If you are looking for a well-written book, this might not be the pick. But if you are looking for something for pure enjoyment, you will enjoy this."
5,Revenge Of The Wannabes.......,"Revenge of the Wannabes, a Clique Novel by Lisi Harrison. I have read all three of the Clique series and am looking foward to read the fourth one. I loved reading this book! The ideas and cliffhanges were clever and suspicious. But I wonder what would have happened if Alicia did not cheat on the uniform contest? Why did Alicia want to find replicas of Dylan and Kristen instead of different people? While reading this book I had many questions but I always found the answers. This book is my favorite book out of The Clique series. This book is also my favorite book I have read all year!!! All the characters have their own ideas and styles and so much more. Any Westchester girl would love to read this book and wish they were Massie Block and all of her friends!!!"
4,The Clique is back!!,"This book is awesome!! Even better than the first two. It has more suspence and drama. Also, it's longer so clique fans can enjoy their favorite stories with out having to wait for another book to come out!!"
3,Whatever,"OK not to sound snobby but I am rich and me and my friends act nothing like this. We all live in big houses that's true but we don't call ourselves the 'Pretty Commitie' or anything else like that. We aren't total brats to everyone we me and sure we have a lot of designers in our closets but we don't go around acting like we have never heard of Hanes, in fact I wear the shirts all the time. But these books are well written and I like them a lot but they are totally unrealistic."
2,Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want This Time,"To have Massie and her ""Pretty Commitee"" to be mowed down by daddy's 75,000 dollar Bentley. With sophmoric plot lines ""Ehmahgod, they stole our box and won the fashion show?!"". Grating, constant name dropping (yes we get it, you're cool because you drink starbucks and have a sick obsession with becoming famous with no talent, very chic.) I myself am just a few years older then these girls (14 on Sunday) and come from an upper-middle class neighborhood but I'm not anything like these kids, and neither are any of the other people I know. Lisi Harrison is living out a far-fetched uber-bitch teen dream that in the early novel was slightly refreshing with it's lack of retribution for the snobs but is now just annoying."
4,CURTIS MAYFIELD,"A TRIBUTE TO CURTIS MAYFIELD RECORDED BY VARIOUS ARITISTS PAYING TRIBUTE TO MR. MAYFIELD.SOME OF THE SONGS DONE BY THE ARTISTS ARE REALLY GOOD. SUCH AS THE ONES SUNG BY GLADYS KNIGHT, WHITNEY HOUSTON, TEVIN CAMPBELL, ARETHA FRANKLIN, PHIL COLLINS, ELTON JOHN, ARE REALLY THE GOOD ONES. ESPECIALLY ""KEEP ON PUSHING"" RECORDED BY TEVIN CAMPBELL! THAT'S MY ""BOY""! HE CAN PERFORM ANYTHING THAT COMES HIS WAY. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE WHEN YOU JUST WANT TO HEAR DIFFERENT ARTISTS AT ONE TIME ON THE SAME CD. ON A SCALE OF 1-5 I RATE IT A 4. NOT BAD AT ALL."
2,2 1/2 stars,"I am a fan of Candace Camp, but this story was just not...written well. This actually could have been a very good story, however, the way it was written was too...slow. The story was more focused on the mystery than the romance. In fact, we don't see much romance until 3/4 of the way through! Until that, all they do is have one kiss, and continue telling each other that they don't love each other anymore. But it's not even that they vehemently deny it, with tension and arguments that are heated with sexual tension and emotion, it's just...bland. It's not even sad. Camp can do, and has done, better than this. Skip this one."
4,Polycom Sound Station,Works as claimed in documentation. Works well in a conference room setting. There is no push-to-talk capability so it can't be used in a secure operations environment.
2,Incomplete,"I was very puzzled. A number of hotels were not listed, nor were quite likely the majority of restaurants. In the former category I would offer the Raddison Admiral which I like mostly for its location. Of the latter, for instance, only 4 Indian restaurants were listed: standing in front of one of them I counted 7 (in about a block).Makes me wonder: What gets an establishment into a guide book?"
3,Not for everyone.,"I have not quite finished reading the book, but can already tell its not for introverted people. If you want to remember names, but don't want to engage in an elaborate social encounter each time you meet someone, this book is not for you."
3,Average,The product was a pretty good buy with the exception of the three vibrating rings. The vibrating rings are dysfunctional and I have reason to believe that the internal battery is dead and the reason to blame. Other than that there are a great variety for pleasure.
5,Big Shoes,"This is one of the best books about fathers I have ever read. It is a good variety of people not just stars but authors, etc. And the stories are not all happy but are honest and the fathers all taught or left the authors with lessons and or memories that they have carried with them and now shared with us. And Al so nicely compiled for us. It is a great read and a great gift for husbands, brothers or sons. It is a good re-read so a good keeper for the book shelf."
5,Does What It Says,"I'm a nurse who works 3-4 days per week, from 0600-1830, which means waking up by 4:30. On the nights before I have to work, I always take one of these pills at 7pm so that I can fall asleep by 8pm. It is always effective in helping me fall asleep, and I have never felt groggy the next day. Without these pills, I know that I wouldn't get enough sleep to make it through my 12+ hour day."
5,Good Dog Review,"Great pictures that capture the essence of bounding, out-of-control, canine enthusiasm. Mrs. Birdhead and cat get supporting character awards. It's a fun book to read to children."
3,Wade To The Good Stuff,"There are some funny comedians on Def Comedy Jam. The problem is, you have to sit through the less than talented ones who rely soley on profanity and raunch to rile up the boisterous crowd."
3,Cormac Junky Review,"I admit it. I am hooked on McCarthy. Working thru every published thing the man has written. Just finished Outer Dark moments ago. Once you have the ""break through"" into his writing, (getting used to paragraph long sentences and the stunning lack of commas), you get totally and completly sucked into his world. The smells, taste, awe, the horror. Usually. I know outer dark is an early work and it is, in itself, truly amazing. At the same time, I did not find myself as transported into the story as Suttree, a work of similar nature and setting.I would recomend this book, but not as a first Cormac read. You want your socks knocked off? Read Blood Meridian. Hell, read them all....But be ready to be changed. There is no going back after McCarthy."
5,I Loved It But Not Sure Why,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book (if ""enjoyed"" is the right word) but I have no idea what it's about. Like all the other McCarthy books I've read, it is compelling from word one. No one today shapes the English language like McCarthy. His every word is poetry. His ear for dialog and dialect is staggering. His description of everything, I mean EVERYTHING, is unerring, uncannily so. His ability to set a (mostly) dark and somber mood is (literally) scary. But I don't know what the book was about. I guess it was about a lot of things. No matter to me: I just enjoyed reading it. I enjoyed the suspense, the symbolism, the gothic emotion, the rawness of it. I've read several McCarthy books. I was lukewarm about the Border Trilogy, but hooked after ""The Road"", ""No Country..."" and others. Wonderful, masterful book. But I still don't know what it was about...."
5,An epic poem steeped in jimsonweed,"Like ""The Road""; a rococo epic of misery; hopeless, bleak, expansive, empty, hideous and hero-less. In a good way. I wish there were a hundred more CM books. And I'm sorry I employed semicolons in this ""review"""
2,Junk,The battery compartment is so poorly designed it is almost impossible to install the battery cover and have the contacts meet properly. Their gyration remotes are good... this is crap.
4,Higgins Classic,"Eye of the Storm is a book about Sean Dillon. In this book Dillon and a former friend from the IRA, Martin Brosnan, go head to head. Dillon is a terrorist who plans an attack on the British government and we wonder was it staged by Saddam Hussein, the KGB, some other terrorist organization? The people that have to stop Dillon are the same people he will work for down the road."
5,Great writing By Jack Higgins.,The typical character is back and better than ever. great characters and wonderful fight scenes make this a winner to read! Pulse pounding right up to the climax. Un-down-putable!
3,"exciting, but ultimately not very satisfying","2 gripes: 1. Sean Dillon's Irish ""charm"" was overshadowed by his ruthlessness. If this had been my first encounter with Dillon, I might not have become such a Higgins fan. 2. The ""logistics"" of the ending were preposterous. Not the favorite of this Higgins fan, but all in all, a decent thriller standing on its own."
5,Delightful,"My granddaughter loves this book. Like all of Eric Carle's books, it's a great story and the pictures are wonderful."
2,Not up to par,My son liked the colors in this book but it did not hold his interest as the others by Eric Carle. All in all this book was a disappointment.
3,Overrated and a bit pretentious.,"Criterion gave this its standard excellent treatment including a choice of eight narrations(!) none of which are all that interesting except for namedropping. I can think of a hundred other films off the top of my head that deserve Criterion's attention before this. I wasn't familiar with Maddin's work (except for titles) prior but took a chance from these raving reviews and was quite disappointed. Holy Mountain, Eraserhead, Santa Sangre, Kenneth Anger, classic silent cinema... sorry, this ain't it. The director is obviously a huge fan of all the stuff and more but there's an edge missing here of authenticity. If your into Maddin's work this is probably for you but if your a fan of Bunuel, early Lynch, Murnau, Jodorowsky... I doubt you'll be impressed. Four stars for the packaging, two for the content equals out at three for the total."
3,The Undefeated: The Oklahoma Sooners and the greatest winning streak in college football,Maybe I knew too much of the story before I read it but there was more info about the players and coaches and the women they had than about football. I would have liked to read about the football games they won!!!
5,GREAT! Kids love it!,"This is such a great bench! My kids LOVE to be able to sit at it. My 2 year old is LOVING it. It was super easy to put together. It seems very durable too. It's heavy duty, but light weight enough to flip easily. My 2 year old is a little scared to sit on the bench seats and rock, but loves to sit on the under side of the table and let me rock him. He LOVES it. they play hide and seek under the table, color, eat etc all with this. I wished I'd had it earlier when my 11 year old was little."
5,One word: Wow!,"Though I prefer the early Basie sound of the 30's, this album is remarkable for its clarity, sound quality and sheer presence. Basie also sounded better live than in any studio, and this disc exemplifies this phenomenon. Unlike many other live recordings, there is very little, if any, background noise, superfluous pops and buzzes or anything else to mar the magnificent sound. Incredibly, Basie was relegated to being a warm-up act for Sinatra in the Copa Room in Vegas and these songs were recorded as Basie and the boys swung before the Chairman hit the stage.The highlights of this album are undoubtedly One O'Clock Jump and the swingin' Jumpin' at the Woodside. It's impossible not to become a Basie convert if you listen to just these two cuts. The brass section really cuts loose and you'll find yourself wanting to get up and just cut loose. That's what Basie is for: smiling, swingin' and having a great time. What a master musician and bandleader he was. Enjoy this collection!"
4,Cheap and it works as expected.,Don't expect this belt hoslter to protect your cell phone bcos it is not intended to do that.This belt holster fits perfectly to my Motorola V300 and it adds to the look of the cell phone. I can hook it on to my belt and swivel it to a horizontal position. The swivel is useful if you want to get in and out of cars or want to sit comfortably without the cell phone poking into your tummy! It does not scratch the cell phone as well.But you have to take out the cell phone from the holster to use it.Good value. Better than the expensive ones for the intended purpose.
5,This book makes more sense than anything I have ever read.,"When it comes to relationships, this book is the most accurate and profound experience we have ever read. It simply makes sense and anyone who has read it and applied it to their lives will agree. Refreshing and candid, it reads well and is easily shared with others. Every group I belong to finds it fascinating and helpful in both their personal and professional relationships. I can not recommend it highly enough. I love the second book, The Character Code as well. You will never regret reading or listening to anything Dr. Hartman produces."
1,Boring,"Wow this DVD sucked. I'm a big fan of hidden camera comedy but I've laughed harder at shows like Candid Camera or The Jamie Kennedy Experiment. The pranks you get in ""meet the creeps"" are done by guys who you would expect what they call ""pranks"" to be their normal behavior, so they weren't getting reactions out of people.You can tell the people they were playing pranks on were preassuming their behavior just based on how they look, so the reactions out of them were just lame, not outrageous."
5,Awesome,"This is two movies in one. The Ewoks are adorable. If you didn't get enough Ewoks in ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"" then you have over 2 hours of them in this DVD!"
1,GREAT TITLE BAD NOVEL,"This has to be John Gardner's least successful James Bond novel. It has a meandering plot, which leaves the reader totally bored. It was difficult for me to even finish reading this Book.I was very disappointed. After ""Icebreaker"" I thought Gardner was finally on the right track."
5,Role of Honor keeps the 007 formula going!!!,"Not John Gardner's best, but certanly not his worst. The plot and villians could be spruced up a bit to make it better. At least SPECTRE is in it. This 007 book is very complex and only should be read by true 007 fans!"
5,"Must-have, must-read.","Anyone who loves poetry, relishes seeing how passion and ideas can be crafted into memorable, soul-shaking language, read Irving Layton. This selection is a must-have, must read for anyone who loves the English language in general, and poetry in particular."
2,Thin and unabsorbant,"Attends used to be so good, but now they are thin and quick to leak. But adult diapers are an interesting thing, because many brands are good for different situations. Still, though, Attends are good for very little."
2,Wrong Item Twice,"I ordered this product over a month ago and when I received it it was not the product I ordered. It was Super Green Protein Powder but a vanilla bean flavor, not the spirulina product I've ordered and received in the past from this vendor. I called Vitamin Shoppe and explained that I had been sent the wrong product. I was told to put it back in the packaging for the shipper to pick up, at no charge to me. I waited a couple of weeks and another box arrived. When I opened it, it was the vanilla bean flavor again!! Frustrated and wanting protein powder for my morning smoothie, I decided to open it and try it. The flavor is gross. I am going to call them to see if I can get a refund on my purchase, since I waited so long, received the wrong product twice and dislike the protein powder they sent."
2,CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION,"Review of 1st Edition...VERY DISAPPOINTING FOR A NEWLY PUBLISHED BOOK, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A SEASONED CRIME SCENE SEARCH INVESTIGATOR. ALTHOUGH THE TEXT IS EASY TO READ AND UNDERSTAND, IT IS TOO ELEMENTARY, AND APPEARS TO OFFER NOTHING NEW. THERE IS A GENERAL LACK OF ELABORATION OF COVERED TOPICS/TECHNIQUES. THE TITLE OF THIS BOOK SHOULD HAVE INCLUDED THE WORD, ""INTRODUCTION"" OR ""BASIC"". DEFINITELY A BOOK FOR BEGINNERS OR THOSE SEEKING GENERAL KNOWLEDGE. TOO PRICEY FOR THE CONTENT."
5,Amazing Music,I was refered to Daivd Nevue by a friend. Bought this CD and fell in love with his music. You will not be dissapointed
4,Tissot Navigator 3000,"A great watch for the frequent traveler as it can display two time zones, store up to four additional time zones, and easily swap time zones between the digital display and the hands. Large easy to read face and handsome styling. The watch has lots of other features including 2 alarms, stopwatch, timer and several types of date displays. The two main negatives are lack of an ""indiglo"" type light of face, and a somewhat cryptic user manual. Otherwise I love it. Tons of features and clean appearance."
1,"Nice looking, but mine only lasted 25 days","I bought this watch because it was very cool looking and dual time which I need for my job. After I received it I found out you push the crown in for 2 seconds to activate the touch screen to get to the various functions (date, world time, chrono, etc). Every time I bent my wrist it was beeping at me trying to activate the touch screen. I called Tissot (really Swatch) about this they said to just turn the beep off and then they told me they have already discontinued this watch. Finally after just 25 days it quit working and was permanently stuck in one of the function modes so I returned it. Amazon very quickly refunded my money. Happy with Amazon, but I'll never own another Tissot."
4,Not that bad,Saw Dio live in Austin on this albun until F**cin APD ran him off for being too loud (Dio too loud LOL). It is my favorite album next to the first and Lock up the Wolves. Yes Tracy G is no Craig Goldie or Vivian Campbell (why Def Leppard) but this album rocks!!!! Pain is my favorite next to Give her the Gun (Dio always has an abuse song of some kind). Yes uneven but it has some of his heaviest rockers ever espcially since Jeff Pilson (ex-Dokken) played bass. Ignore the lyrics and rock out!!!
2,Slow and heavy,"If you think this one will sound like ""Holy diver"" or the other albums in Dio's earlier career you're in for a surprise, and not a pleasant one. On ""Strange highways"" Dio is going for the slow and heavy, no up tempo at all. ""Hollywood black"" and ""Blood from a stone"" are good tunes, but all these ""low key"" songs that seems to weight a million pounds gets quite boring after a while. When you're listening to ""Strange highways"" you shouldn't be surprised finding yourself glance at your cd collection in hope to find something faster and more melodic - maybe Judas Priest's ""Breaking the law"" or Rainbow's ""Kill the king""."
2,Dio Reaches Into The Abyss & The Abyss Reaches Into Him,"The lowest point of Dio's entire career. This album makes the '90-something Sabbath reunion album Dehumanizer look inspired (and that's f*cking scary). This album is purile & putrid. Tracy G is one of those guitarists that thinks he's good but he isn't. His tone is irritating. His style is slop. His solos are vomit! Jesus, Mary & The Holy Ghost is the only saving grace of this entire album. Definitely a bargain-bin bummer. It soundz like Dio heard that hard metal was making a comeback so he tried to punch up his sound and came off annoyingly. Tragic. But the skies are starting to clear on the Dio horizon after this glaring setback."
2,Dio's decline starts to speed up,"Dio's career seems to have hit a brick wall. After the disappointing release of Lock Up The WOlves, he releases this, another not so hot album. The opener Jesus Mary, and teh Holy Ghost is a killer! Perhaps even my favorite Dio song, but the rest of the album just drags. I still have yet to lesten to the entire CD straight through as I can only listen to it in pieces before wanting to venture on to something else.. Again, only buy if your a Dio fanatic or if the disc is very cheap. On the up side, you've got to give it to Ronnie, he does get good cover art for his albums."
3,"Gorgeous, unusual pictures","You'll never get tired of looking at these amazing pictures. Olander has taken an ancient art form and given it new life as he weaves his expertise as a writer, marine biologist and artist into captivating pictures. Very enjoyable."
2,bad engineering,"this is the 2nd time fall a part this lens hood, if you are not a handy man don't buy it.----the ""fun"" part is i never hit or drop this hood... fall apart by itself"
4,good book,"This book was great just what I was looking for. It arrived quickly and in great shape, very happy with it."
4,Where's Adam?,"No one can come close to singing LOVE STINKS like Adam. Why didn't they put his version in the CD? I don't know but after hearing the real version again (for the first time since, like, 8th grade) it was pretty mellow and not enough ommmph. Adam put the punch in it like it needs and it's too bad it isn't on there. There has got to be a CD with all Adam's movie songs that he himself has made. There's just gotta. Let me know if you know of one that has slipped through my greedy fingers. The CD, is good, but.....it needs more power Jim!"
4,good (best of) selections,"Good band. Good songs. Especially the Mrs Robinson song, I love irritating my best friend with it :)David Rehakauthor of ""A Young Girl's Crimes"""
4,"Eminently sensible, at times poetic","I borrowed this book from a friend and felt I should write a review. The least I could do for Ms Offit, since I didn't pay for the pleasure. Here is what I wrote to the friend who loaned it to me:I've just picked up Night Thoughts - Reflections of a Sex Therapist, and started reading. Most surprised to find that it's both very well written and eminently sensible. I always expect books of this sort to be either trashy, dated, badly written or all three. She writes very poetically. It has given me plenty of food for thought."
4,Mrs.Pollifax Unveiled,"This book was very good except that it doesn't really have an inner meaning. Dorothy Gilman wrote this book with everything saying what it meant requiring no deeper thought. It kept the readers interest very well though. It had many suspenceful points to keep you reading. Plus you never know what Mrs.Pollifax is going to do or think of next. For example when she had the sheep stampede the sniper camp. That was definately an interesting part of the story. Over all this was a wonderful, intersting book to read and I would recomend it to everyone."
3,Just OK,"I thought the clips from the film which were included with this were pretty good, but the Q and A from the students with Rose Byrne I felt were less interesting. One of the students seemed to be trying to show how much he knew rather than to ask a question. Considering this is only a short, probably worthwhile to watch if you have some interest in this film, but the 3 star rating I give pretty much offers my opinion of it-mediocre."
5,Must have grill book,I have made more recipes from this cookbook than any other book in my collection. Just the chicken recipes alone are worth it. I was never expecting it to be a favorite when I originally purchased it. My sister now owns it too and has given it a pretty good workout also. Relatively easy with plenty of good photos. You will not regret owning it and no I don't work for Weber.
5,Webber;s grilling,"Excellent book on grilling, I wanted a book on Charcoal but found this book full of good information that can be used by both gas and woodl"
3,"bought nearly two years ago, just stopped working and customer service is M.I.A.","scale worked while it lasted, although it was not 100% accurate, based on comparing it to a doctors scale. but, it would at least let me keep an eye on changes here n there. it stopped working last week; i replaced the battery but that wasnt the problem. back of the scale has an email address to contact customer service; i used it but they havent responded and its been about 72 hours. i wont be buying this brand again."
2,Failed in the 2nd Season,"I'm one of those people that will pay just about anything for a product that works and so when I saw this was brass I believe it had to be the best to work year after year. First year, great. Second year it has established a leak in outlet for reasons I can't even find. Regardless it leaks. On to the next one."
5,Great musicianship once again from Karl Sanders,This is a chill album w/ great vibe warmings. IF u like NILE get this to add to the collection.Even if not this a non-metal album w/ influences and thoughts from Nile's MASTERPIECES! Sick and Dark Acoustic Guitar Parts w/ Eastern Percussion and Vocal Pieces!
1,Like washing with WAX,I've been a user of this stuff for years. This batch barely generates any suds and leaves my hair like it's been covered in wax.
2,"New formula is not so great, but I love the pump","As others have stated, the formula used for this has recently changed. I don't think I'd describe it as ""waxy"", rather I'd say the ratio of shampooing agent to conditioning agent has changed. If it was a 50/50 ratio before, I'd describe this as 95/5. I've been using the new formula for about 1.5 months and the misses has commented on my hair feeling more coarse now (without me having voiced to her my displeasure from the new formula).In addition, as someone who has been Subscribed to this product, I feel like the change in formula warrants this product being listed as a totally new product and that my Subscription should not have purchased this item.That said, I love the pump that the new bottle comes with!"
1,Garbage,"I bought this about two months ago, a larger version, and placed it on my boat four weeks ago. When I returned to the RV park I store my boat at the tarp had already ripped in a few places.Of course my return limit was over so I am out of luck. The only reason I tried this one from Amazon was because the tarps I buy at Walmart usually only last about six-nine months out in the Florida sun. But 4 weeks?????? 30 dollars wasted. I guess it's back to Wallyworld for any more tarps!Absolute garbage and I would strongly recommend staying away from this product."
2,Not 10mm thick. Inaccurate description.,"I use other tarps that are labeled as 10mm.These are lighter in weight and feel than others that I use. I have compared them side by side.Not bad, I'd say... just not as advertised. These from Amazon are also less expensive by 25%BTW: despite Amazon's description, the packages are not labeled 10mm... and not labeled ""Super Heavy Duty"" only ""Heavy Duty"", but ya can't put a caliper to that.Additionally, if your looking for a solid brown side.... the tarp seamed so that the silver side folds onto the brown. Giving you brown with a 2"" silver border.... sorta foolish.Caveat Emptor. Amazon, I'm disappointed with your inaccurate description.Can't tell you how they perform... I'll check back in a year. Just kiddin'."
5,Good quality tarp for the price,Needed a brown tarp to cover my woodpile so it wasn't quite as much of an eyesore and this is working out perfectly. It is fairly thick and seems to be a high quality tarp. Only had it out for a few weeks but it is keeping the wood dry and we'll see how it holds up over time.
3,OK tarp for temporary use,This tarp is good for several months of exposure to the sun and rain and then starts to deteriorate.After that time it no longer is waterproof. The low cost allows for replacement when needed.
4,Great Product But....,The new iSkin is a great improvement because the whole iPod is covered. It would be very hard for moisture to leak through this case!!! My only complaint is that the new iTrip does not stay in the dock connector when the iSkin is on. It does have an opening but it is not big enough for the iTrip to click in securely. I am disappointed that neither comapny thought of this because I have always loved and used both products.
4,Good story,First Anne Perry I've read. A good mystery with lots of background of the period. I liked the interaction between the characters.
4,A Victorian Colombo,"I thought this book dragged at first, but then it picked up. I think I will enjoy the Charlotte and Pitt mysteries. Pitt reminded me of Columbo and I enjoyed that image in my mind while reading this. There were parts I found unbelievable, but sometimes that just part of a good yarn.It seemed that Perry gave us a descriptive image of what things were like in that time and place. I'm looking forward to reading her second novel in the Charlotte and Pitt series."
2,creeps me out,"I had known about anne perry's homicidal activity before I ever read a book by her. Maybe that's why this book creeps me out so much. In a debate over nature vs. nurture, ms. perry clearly is on the side of nurture. She interminably bludgeons one with observations that OTHER people drive you to crime either by driving you crazy or bringing you up poorly. She may be a social critic but I really don't know if her depictions of morals and manners of her stories' times are even accurate! Perhaps she understands the criminal mind better than others do but she seems to leave little room for personal responsibility or the power of love. I wonder why?"
4,Excellent read.,I loved this book. Charlotte is a timeless character and I look forward to reading more books in this delightful series. I started the second book after finishing the first book. Kudos to Anne Perry for creating such wonderful stories.
4,Perry Introduces Thomas Pitt,"This book was excellent. Perry's portrayal of England at the turn of the century (well, actually 1881), was picture perfect, replete with fog-filled streets barely lit by gas lamps. This is a book to read on a rainy winter's night. I especially enjoyed the way constables and law enforcement were considered second class tradesmen who should not dare infringe upon the lives of the priviledged; murder investigation be darned. This is the only Anne Perry novel I have read thus far, and I wanted to start at the beginning. If this book is any pre-cursor to the rest of the series, we are all in for a treat."
4,Excellent lineup.,This event had some very exciting fights! I was very impressed with this event as it is yet another example of how far Pride has come. Highly recommended!!
5,I won't use plastic again!,"I've been using Smart Pots for the last few months and I've been very pleased. They're lighter than other planting pots and are easy to maneuver. Machine washable, although I recommend to wash with water only so you don't contaminate your plants. My plants thrive in Smart Pots!"
5,"""The Best of Earl Klugh"" (Warner)","Wow! What a wonderful CD. As always, Earl Klugh is brilliant as he displays his talents on the keyboards, classical guitar, acoustic guitar, and mandolin. He is assisted beautifully by percussionist Paulinho DaCosta, George Benson guitarist, Harvey Mason DMX and drums, and many other renowned artists. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this CD. If you like a cool, relaxed style of guitar music with beautiful accompaniment, treat yourself to this wonderful piece of music by Earl Klugh."
2,Umm...not for me.,"I really had to force myself to read this one, thinking, maybe it will get better. Unfortunately it didn't. I really enjoy parnormal romance/urban fantasy books. But, this one was just not believable. It really was silly and the characters were 2 dimensional at best. If you like your reads more on the fluff side (as this one is)try the Undead series by Maryjanice Davidson."
2,"Bad, Bad, Bad","This book kept me going for about 116 pages, but only because I hate to give up on anything. It wasn't worth the price or the time I put in on it. It is definitely too wordy, not all of the words making a whole lot of sense. I love books with humor and funny situations, but this one didn't have any of that for me."
5,Hilarious read!,This is the funniest book I've read in a long time (since the first few Stephanie Plum novels) I was laughing out loud. I bought the book and then bought another one for my sister. This is a definate keeper.
2,Like a Bad Round Robin,"This book was very, very silly. Terribly silly. Almost terrible. It reminds me of something that might result from an online round-robin with a bunch of giddy paranormal-romance authors. (readers of fan-fic will know what I mean.)The basic plot: an almost-immortal chick who is guardian of the cup of immortality. A TDH (tall dark and handsome) who is under a curse and must kill Our Heroine to save his own skin. And the skin of all the males in his family.There are dead characters, Satan, Satan's Son, a dragon who likes cyber-sex, and carb-free pretzels. All wrapped up in a plot which was hashed over waaaay too many times (I don't want to kill you but I must but boy I lust after you let's have sex).If you're looking for the lightest bit of fluff to while away a plane ride (I was), this is ok. But again, you may find yourself wishing at the end that you'd passed this up (I did).(*)>"
4,It was alright....,"This band is very talented i think. I just wasn't able to get that into it. But I did like it and it was a cool CD by this band. It was just that some of the songs I would just skip over. However I did have some favorites on here. In particular, the song ""Inside"" is one cool song.so,in conclusion....It was okay and I liked it.-SlItHeR tHiNg!!!"
3,not the best collection of writings,"I wasn't too impressed with this book -- it doesn't flow very well as a whole. Perhaps a good intro to Merton, but I prefer just reading his writings in whole."
5,Dissociative Identity Disorder,"What it is, why it is, and what you can do about it.No individual personal stories. Just the facts.I found this book very helpful."
1,I'm terribly disappointed!,"I am in no way speaking of the songs on the disc themselves, and definitely not the fantastic band, but this collection was nothing short of a complete let-down. It's nothing but 4 or so songs from each album. Big whoop. Where are the rare b-sides? Alternate Icelandic versions? Unreleased remixes? Live cuts? They're still lying on the out-of-print 12 inch singles, that's where! This could have been such an awesome endeavor. I can't even see a completist wanting this! I bought this and The B-52's ""Time Capsule"" on the same day. Quite comparable bands, and (sadly) quite comparably uninspiring Best Of compilations. It's evident that these were not made for the fans, but made instead to market the bands to new listeners, most notable with The Sugarcubes. With this in mind, I do save respect for them for the hilarious title."
2,I break em easy!,"I push the limits my equipment putting 400,000 frames on 5Ds and dragging my gear all over the world. Most everything can survive what I demand. Kata partially sold me on their products with a video on their website that claims military grade quality. This thing has a plastic joint when extended and I broke two of them (at the plastic joint) within a few months. Kata was good to me and replaced it once for free but I broke it again. I had a big well made piece of luggage in this same role that held up against my abuse for over two years, and these carts last me about two months. Granted I am putting a lot of weight on this thing maybe 75 pounds. The only military quality about this thing is the cost."
4,Cleopatra raises the roof!,"Cleopatra is so cool! They are like Hanson, except soooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better!!! ""The Bird's Song"" and ""Two Timer"" are my favorites!! Although I would like Zainam or Yonah to have the lead vocals in at least one song. But otherwise, they DEFINITELY RAISE THE ROOF!!!!!!"
1,no talent losers,"i know that like everyone is totally in love with these girls but...WAKE THE HECK UP! they can't sing, they can't dance, and they are annoying. they should be spending their time on something they are good at. they have potential to be something if they just applied themselves. i guarantee you though, they will be one hit wonders and they will be 4ever 4gotten! sorry guys, but it's true."
1,"I first thought this CD would be great, I changed my mind.",Well...It just very depressing when you come home and sit down and you listen to a song like that...it's just not fair to put a man through that kind of torture!!GIRL POWER!
3,They only deserved a little more credit than they got.,"Seven years is exactly how much time I needed to decide what my opinion was of this album, and here it is: Cleopatra was one of the most talented, if underrated, female R&B groups of the late 90s. That being said, there was definitely room for improvement. While expertly produced, the songs simply weren't catchy enough to have longevity. The title track comes off as egocentric and boring, although the other songs are lyrically skillful (""A Touch Of Love,"" The World We Live In,"" ""Dying Rose,""). My favorites are ""Thinking About You,"" and their cover of Michael Jackson's ""I Want You Back."" These tracks depict Cleopatra as they really are - catchy, fun, and sweet."
5,This CD is 2 Kewl!,"OK...I LUV CleopatraZYC! Dats what they are called in Canada! In the U.S. They are Cleopatra but here in Canada and in the U.K. they're called Cleopatra ZYC! IT sez on their CD cover. Their music is really different and really great! A MUST HAVE DANCE CD MAN! I think it's amazing that someone that young can write songs like that! But, I also think that the backup singers should have equal chances to sing...as they're all VERY talented. GREAT CD AGAIN! Can't wait fo the next one. BUT LET THE OTHER TWO SING ON THAT ONE!"
4,"Pretty Good, A Little Too Childish But Still Cool Hits!!!!","The three Cleopatra chicks obviously have talent but a few songs are cheesy and too much like the Spice Girls. The best songs are The Bird Song and Dying Rose. They could definately drop Cleopatra's Theme and Two Timer but the rest was either smooth, cool R&B or funky, upbeat pop sounds. This CD is only for people who like hyper kinda sounding music but kids who are into like No Doubt, Matchbox 20 or Sublime are gonna say ""What 'da heck is this?"" Overall, pretty good."
4,The most accurate account yet,"Although I prefer the excitement and narrative of Sidney D. Kirkpatrick's book ""A Cast of Killers,"" Giroux's account of the William Desmond Taylor murder is most likely the definitive version. Very well researched and methodical in its conclusions, it eliminates much of the sensationalism that has been attached to this case over the years (particurlarly Adela Rogers St. John's fanciful accounts). Although a murderer is never named, the murder itself is ""solved."" Want to know the ending? Buy the book! Although well written, it does lack some of the zing of Kirkpatrick's story."
3,Radiation Book,"A great read if one is looking to learn the basics on radiation. It is simple to read and easy to follow. We are using it for a textbook, which I would not recommend."
4,Based on a true story-a girl survives alone for over 18 yrs,"Island of the Blue Dolphins is a remarkable story. This book was based on the true story of a young Indian girl. The girl, discovered in the early 1800's, was found on an island off the coast of California. She had lived on the island, all alone, for over18 years. She was known only as The Lost Woman of San Nicolas. Her people, known as The Indians of Ghalas-at, had long since disappeared.O'Dell's story features a young Indian girl, named Karana. Karana struggles to survive alone on the Island of the Blue Dolphins. She has to find her own food, build her own shelter, and protect herself from the wild dogs on the island.This is a wonderful story of a young girl who discovers who she is and what she is made of when faced with insurmountable obstacles. O'Dell's story is captivating and beautifully written. This book is well deserving of the Newbery Award. It would make an excellent addition to any collection."
4,"Solved my problem, but wish they also sold them in single-packs.","This cable is 16 AWG, so you need to make sure it is adequate for your needs. Only extend something that is 16 AWG or higher number. The higher the number, the thinner the wire. Do not extend anything 14 AWG or lower number, or you risk a fire.This item is of high quality and it solved my problem. I bought a microwave oven that came with a straight power plug. The power outlet is directly behind the oven and there is limited space. I needed this flat plug to save me an inch of space.I wish they sold it in single packs, since I only needed one. Now I am out of $18.00 and have four spares to store."
1,Too big for a power strip,"I got these expecting to be able to plug a bunch of them side-by-side in a power strip. I could then plug a wall wart into each. The base of the plug is too wide to fit that close in a standard office power strip. I can liberate one plug per strip, i.e. these are almost useless.I also tried ""Stanley 31372 One-Foot Cord Max Extender, 3-Pack"" and these work great. They are light weight but fine for wall warts.I started with ""Coleman Cable 6991 Power Strip Liberator, 8-Inch Extension Cord, 3-Pack"". These worked as well. But, for home use, the LEDs were a minus. However, I brought them into work. At work, the LEDs are great as I know when the plug is hot.Of these three, the Ziotek were the only ones that were totally useless."
5,Great design and value!,"Use:These cords are great for use on wall power outlet that you want something to push against it. I used these for my TV mount and pushing my coffee maker flush against the wall. I would not suggest these extension cords for power strips, they take up too much space (tryZiotek ZT1212542 Power Strip Liberator 14-Inch Extension, 5-Pack)Quality:The cord is 16 AWG, which is thick, and it is sturdy. The cord is rated at 13A, 125V, 1625W. It is also designed so that you can use two of these cords in one outlet and the plug only sticks out 1/2 an inch (See the picture I added)Overall, I am very pleased with this product and it is a great value (5 for $17 vs 1 for $10Cables To Go - 29804 - Flat Plug Power Strip Plus)"
4,Decent,These work as advertised to get you more space along the wall if you need something flush. I use it for my microwave which sits on my small counter and I wanted as much space as I could get.
4,"Lush illustrations, georgous layout, concise text","I have a copy of the first edition, which is by now dated for both style and technology, but I still occasionally use it as an HTML 3.2 reference. This is a great introduction to website design for non-techies especially people with a visual bias (e.g. artisits). [I am a techy, but I still liked it -- a bit thinner on info. than I am used to, but it was what I was looking for at the time] I bought a second copy for my artist brother-in-law -- who now designs websites, major TV ads, album covers, etc.. I haven't seen V2, but hopefully it addresses the ""dated"" issue by simply revising the examples, technology references (e.g. to cover Microsoft's .NET technology revolution) and business changes. Recommended."
4,As Good As Nimrod,This is Dookie just as good as nimrod but a bit more punkier if you like that sort of thing i know i do. With the most famous song Basket Case on the album and the song She you can't go wrong with buying this album.
5,The Best Cd I own!,"In Dookie,Green Day does the bes job for the punk rock genre to date, its great vocals and tunes. I first baught this CD for only 1 or 2 songs, but after listening to it I was singin' along! To expres ho great this CD is, ny mom even liked it!"
5,Great CD,Green Day is the best band ever. I bought this CD like 5 years a go and i have not stopped listening to it once!! You are not a true lover of punk rock if you don't have this CD. Green Day RULZ!!
4,Great !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The CD, Dookie is very cool. It is almost as good as their newest CD, Nimrod. The song Longview is probably the best song on the CD. They do a great When I Come Around. Basket Case is awesome. After FOD, listen for about one or two minutes. Billy Joe, The lead singer cept the the recorder on. There is a very stupid song. Mike is singing it. If you like Punk Rock get this!P.S. Green Day rules!!!!"
1,super duper fandidliastastic album,"Green Day's Dookie is arguably their best LP. I have read many of the reviews and decided to comment. Do not get it twisted. GREEN DAY IS NOT PUNK! If you are looking for a great punk album this is a bad choice. HOwever, Dookie is one of the most influential bands of the 90's. It paved the way for so many lesser and far more trivial acts like blink, New Found Glory, etc. It stills remains at the top of the genre it created. With radio gems like Longview, Basketcase, When I Come Around, and She how could you go wrong? This is definitly in my top 3 favorite albums of all time. If you are a bored, confused, angry, teen, (like most are). I would strongly advise purchasing this CD. It perfectly describes the teen angst we've all been through. Some say it's unoriginal. I agree. But it is definitly by far the best pop-punk album ever made.PERIOD!!!"
3,I can stand it,"Basically, the only reason I gave this album three stars is because of Basket Case and When I Come Around. When I Come Around is my favorite song because of my virgin ears. For the rest of the songs, well, they have similar yet nifty tunes. I'd have to say that the coolest tune goes to the secret track after F.O.D. I'm not saying much about the lyrics though."
3,"Welcome to paradise, I suppose.......","It was a cute album when it first came out. Got too much airplay just like everything else that was on that album. I can't believe these guys are still jamming. But I'll be honest with you, I'm very tired of the lead singers views on the worlds problems or politics, or our involvement overseas, shutup and play that guitar, you'll never run for office, and you'll never get drafted. Probally my biggest problem with this band right now, them being hippy-wannabees. Overall just another waste of a band I would have to say."
5,WOW - Experience Dookie all over again,"I owned Dookie on a cassette tape that my sister recorded from her cd when it first came out. Then i bought the CD for myself, and it was the first CD i ever owned. I must have listened to it 500 times.So now I own it on vinyl and wow - the band sounds totally different. You can understand the vocals. From the very first drum hits in burnout the sound from this record make your room rock like the band is performing live right in front of you. The harmonies are very pronounced you'll sware somebody hid guitar amps in your room - that's how clear the guitar is.I highly recommend you buy this. If you don't have a record player (like I didn't), go buy one and get this record!"
2,CDgiveaways ripped me off !!!,they sent me a cd that wasn't even new. All they did was rap it in their own plastic. It was listed NEW and was sent USED. rip off
5,im only 16 but....,"well well wellI must say we have a masterpiece on our hands...yup this is definately one of the cds that defined 90s ""Mdern Rock"" and still continues to define to this day.Yes thats right...this cd was released in 94 but still 10 years later...I STILL LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM!This ranks along with CLASSICS like So Long and Thanks For All The Shoes from NOFX and Out Come The Wolves by RANCID, and The Blue Album by Weezer and finally NEVERMIND by NirvanaThis is GreenDays best cd...the only other cd that might even compare would be InsomniacLike I said this is a true masterpiece for punk pop punk and rock alike..."
1,green day show posers like the clash how to make real punk,isnt that right??!?!?this cd is so awesome i listen to it all day. the lyrics are so good and i can relate to themim an ugly lonely 17 year old and they are too
2,this is green days best cd.... sad,"This is Green Days best Cd and its fine if you enjoy the great music seen on MTV but if not youll probably hate it this album isnt really bad the first couple of times you listen to it but it gets annoying fast, also avoid nimrod at all costs its green days worst album. If you want some good music to listen to Buy Strung Out they are great or Apocalypse Hoboken one of the best bands ever!"
4,90s Rock,"I'm not a big Green Day fan, in fact I can't stand their newest album, however, I really like this one. Filled with Classic and solid 90s rock, this album lends a unique sound and will be liked by fan of the band and genre."
5,A classic!,"For those who have become endlessly annoyed with Boulevard of Broken Dreams and American Idiot, it's hard for them to believe that the same band that wrote those songs could have released such a great record. This album was Green Day's third album and major-label debut, and what an album it was. This album includes such great songs as Having a Blast, Longview, Welcome to Paradise, Pulling Teeth, Basket Case (which in my opinion is one of the best songs of the 90's), She, and When I Come Around. In fact, the entire album is great. The last three tracks aren't as good as the others, but in each track you get Green Day's best, and some of the best music you'll ever listen to. This is one album that certainly deserved to be a hit."
5,One of Green Day's Best!!!!!,"This was the CD that got Green Day famous! that wasn't good for fans like me who was a fan long before dookie, but great none the less! This cd was by far the best albums of 1994, and has GREAT classics on it that will stay in your head forever! Let me tell you, if you listen to this in your car and blast this CD, I mean BLAST this baby, you will get horrified looks like you just murdered someone! but i know that you will feel great, because this album just makes you want to jump up and dance!!! Whenever i listen to this Cd, wherever i am, i get up and dance! (yes, even in my car) Believe me when i tell you you'll love this CD, because if your'e like me, you would have gotton this CD the day it came out like i did! you'll love this CD, GUARENTEED!These are some of the best songs on the CD:1. When I come Around ( My Favorite!!!)2. Basket Case3. Longview4. Welcome to Paradise5. She"
5,Everyone needs this CD!,"After reading The Jabez Prayer, I ordered Tim Hossman's CD, Bless Me Indeed. If you enjoyed the book, Tim's song is the icing on the cake! It is absolutely wonderful. His beautiful voice and the great harmony is breath-taking. I'm sure this song will become a frequent praise song in our churches. The tune is catchy and the words keep going around in my head all day long. It is fabulous and I would recommend it to everyone!"
3,"Useful corrective, but...","Johnstone's account of the invention and development of several products on which much of modern technology is based is fascinating, and a useful corrective to myths about the lack of Japanese creativity in science and business.However, Johnstone's focus on the engineers and businessmen has its own problems, foremost of which is that it gives the reader the impression that inspired geniuses are behind every invention, and leads him to neglect inventions which were developed at companies whose research was more systematic.Johnstone is an entertaining writer, but sometimes rather hard to follow."
5,Did Findley Chicken Out?,"Pilgrim is an enthralling book, one that you shouldn't begin unless you have a long stretch of time to devote to it. As well as it is written and as engaging as the plot is, I must wonder if, somewhere along the line, Findley retreats from his original theme of reincarnation. Doesn't it seem that about 3/4 of the way through the story the threads that make reincarnation seem possible begin to loosen and we head instead into Jung's head? There is something disjointed about this change of focus - at least there was to me."
3,a sad crime story,"I have to admit that this is not the most well-written book, but I was still drawn into the story. Being a parent, it made me sick to think of somebody doing those things to their own children.It also makes me proud of my father. He was the lead detective on this case, and I am thankful to Mr. Coston for giving him the recognition he greatly deserves."
4,So graphic I had couldn't finish it,"The book is good, but the crime was so sick and demented that I had to quit reading it."
2,could'nt use,"I couldnt use this product long enough to see if it worked. I was so nauseous and jittery I couldnt do anything, I wish I knew how the results were because I spent alot of money it, but I ended up flushing them down the toilet."
2,IT IS TRUE....EVRYTHING STICKS,"IT IS TRUE...everything sticks to this griddle/grill....and even with a ton of oil and grilling spray (Pam). Although it cooked my food well, I made a huge mess having to constantly spray with every flip of food. The clean up was miserable. If you got this as a gift, then try it since it is cheap. If you bought it or are buying it for yourslef.....return it or DO NOT BUY IT!"
1,Do not buy this product!!,"This is the worst product I have ever seen. On the first use, the non-stick coating started chipping off and the food stuck to it anyway. I have attempted to contact Nathan's to no avail. I cannot get anyone to reply to me about the issue. If you want to buy this, save some time and just send me the money or toss the cash into a fire. You will get the same value from it. I wish I could give this thing zero stars."
1,don't buy nathans griddle,"DO NOT BUY, IT'S NOT SAFE!Received this as a gift for my gas cooktop. Used it once for pancakes and it released a horrible smell (petroleum type) which gave me headache and made me light headed. The coating started to crack and flake and it warped in the middle. I contacted Target for manufacturer's info. to find out about the coating and got nowhere. I wish they would recall this product, it is not safe for many reasons."
5,A must-have for Windows 2000 /AD/Exchange 2000 gurus,"If you are beginning your quest to learn more about Active Directory, going beyond the basics of what a MCSE class or training kit can teach you, this is a great start.Very clearly written. Lot of indepth coverage - which is expected. I think very few Microsoft Press books have the style and clarity of purpose that this author displays, and I value it for that. A great addition to your Windows 2000 library.Bharat SunejaMCT"
4,A Nicely Written Guide For Planning And Implementation,"I bought four books to assist in planning and implementing Active Directory Services. I read this one last but liked it best. It is clearly written and proceeds from background and purpose through planning and implementation. Numerous helpful diagrams illustrate the concepts.I can not give it five stars because there is no CD and because the appendices are not complete enough for a work with the title ""Technical Reference.""The author has written several books on NT and IIS and clearly has command of the subject. This book is written for IT professionals but can be comprehended by serious newcomers. Only expert level administrators will need more."
1,Too much bafflegab...,I bought 3 Active Directory books and only one was written clearly - and it wasn't this one. One thing I can't stand is bafflegab - when people try to make something seem more important or esoteric than it really is. This book is full of it. Don't bother.
5,Simply Great,"I was an NT 4 Admin for a major Fortune 100 firm and was looking for a better AD book. This was it! Mr. Iseminger broke down some fuzzy relations including DNS, 2000 domain controllers, schemas, and directory services...He also wrote it from NT 4 admins perspective and broke down the issues w/ the domain model and the need for the scalable AD environment...I've always been a Mark Minasi (author) fan but I'll be watching for more books by Isminger in the future!"
3,Nice Light-Medium Duty Tarp,"I bought this tarp to cover a pile of 2"" landscaping rock while I worked on a project. I was concerned that the tarp might now hold up well with the sharp rocks, and I was right. After just 5 days covering the rock pile in wind and rain, there were many holes in the tarp from the rocks that punctured it. Depending on your planned use, you may want to consider a heavier duty tarp. That said, I think this one would be fine for light-medium duty use."
2,"Large tarp, flimsy grommets","I bought this tarp to spread over a large area to kill grass. While unfolding the tarp, five of the grommets fell off. I'm glad I wasn't going to use the tarp to cover something important! After I kill the grass, this tarp will be relegated to ""under the tent duty."" You get what you pay for and compared to other tarps of this size, this was one of the cheapest."
2,"Content is good, but many errors","So far I read through the first few chapters of ""Principles and Applications of Electrical Engineering"" and was pleased with how well written and straightforward the text is. However, the first chapter is really nothing more than a sales pitch for the Ford Escape hybrid and some land speed record electric vehicle. There are also numerous errors in the figures printed throughout the text, many being entirely different from what the text suggests they should be. Despite everything, my professor has assured me that there really aren't any better texts for an undergraduate course at the junior level."
2,"Disappointed, useless in the field.","No photos, sparse black and white drawings (most plants don't even get a drawing). This book could be used as a cross-reference at best for a true field guide."
3,I like it & .. I don't like it....,"after using it for couple of weeks here are my observations.- I like it because:It REALLY put me in a deep altered state, especially when using night programs. I felt better concentrated and relaxed, more confident too....- I don't like it because:It caused me to become dizzy, and it is because of those blinking lights in glasses, although I use calm blue on lowest setting - it is still too bright and all those blinking makes me dizzy. In the morning the state of being dizzy continues for the whole day... Alas,... maybe it is just my brain's response and your will be different. I would suggest you getting one and trying and putting your response here. Afterwards Richard Bandler recommended them. Hope that will work for you.P.S. after using it for a month I returned the product. The company didn't refund the shipping, so I end up paying shipping twice!"
2,"Not what I was expecting, but too low cost to return","Order was for Facial Cleansing Pillows, and what arrived was an item that you use with a machine. Rather than pay for return shipping, I have kept the items and will make them work somehow."
3,Until the end..... read the first in the series first,"I read ""Until the End"" and I thought it was a pretty good plot, but it wasn't as strong and as interesting as the first two books in the series. I was looking forward to learning more about Maris' and Lauren's relationship, but something seemed to be lacking. I would definitely encourage anyone to read the first two books first before reading this one, just to get a general idea of what is going on."
3,"Too thin, Pup hated chicken flavor!!","It's hard to find a safe toy for your fur pal today.Even worse, a safe choice for a treat, or teething chew.Not saying your pup may not like these, but my lil girl hated them.She's a small pup, but the stick like chew, wasn't made thick enough for her, or fun to chew.She couldn't stand the scent, she wailed, in her crate, when I went to get her, she was uncomfortably back at the end, as if I put a snake in her safe place.I really felt horrible, I took the chew, but that look of fright on her sweet lil pup face, burned into me.Again doesn't mean your pup may not like these chews, just my experiance with them & my poor traumatized pup was not a good one, or positive.So just give one to your tea cup pup, & he or she may like them.You never know, just didn't work for us. Better luck-BB & CC"
1,absolute trollop,"this book is incredibly boring and incredibly over-rated. it is force-fed to students in many schools and i, as a teacher, am sick of having to teach a class of uninterested pupils about a book, that is coma-inducing pap."
1,DO NOT ORDER!!!!!!,"These chairs are labeled wrong on Amazon and are not shipped correctly. I ordered these chairs 3 months ago and recieved a toy train instead. I called Amazon to return the toy train and they promptly shipped me another toy train! So far I have received 3 toy trains and not a single chair. Their is a problem within Amazon or Target where the items or item numbers are mixed up. You will not receive these chairs. But if you want a toy train that your kid can sit on...go ahead and order these chairs. I do not know who has the mix-up but I described it at length with Amazon who said they would have it fixed.....but alas, another toy train. I now have received a full refund."
4,I LOVE THIS BOOK,"I GENERALLY ENJOY THIS AUTHOR BOOKS THIS IS A KEEPER IN MY PRIVATE COLLECTION. IT BRINGS TWO LONERS TOGETHER IT HAS DANGER, ADVENTURE ANDHAPPY ENDING."
1,Dont Waste Money,"This book was a dissapointment, I was so pissed because I was really looking forward to reading this because I LOVE Diana Palmer, but this was terrible I spent the whole day reading it and just finshed it and I kep telling myself it would get better, but that was not the case. The book was totally unrealstic and just kepy getting more unrealistic by the minute. I was really looking forward to this book, it had such a good plot. I wish I listened to the reviews on this book, anyone who reads these reviews should listen do NOT waste your money on this book."
3,Inconsistent and overly complicated,"As a big DP fan, I think Colby's book was one of the most eagerly anticipated in years. However, several aspects of this work keep it from living up to this recurring character's potential. First, an overly complicated drug smuggling plot, in which every character in her ""Merc"" series makes an appearance, becomes rather cumbersome. I had trouble keeping track of the implausible dilemma. As such, the main characters fall rather flat. My biggest problem was several apparent contradictions and mistakes that I can't believe any good editior could miss. Characters have ""sudden"" revelations about events they have already addressed, or have been stated as having known. Though Colby and Sarina had a good set-up, I feel they were cheated of a quality story. Overall, I feel like this book was ok, but somewhat sloopy in execution."
2,Very predictable,"I had the entire story figured out by about page 10 and I'm not usually very good at guessing plots. This was extremely predictable. The characters were okay, but not great. The little girl, Bernadette, is by far the best character in the book. Not really worth the time or money to read."
5,Wonderfully quiet product,"Love these pillow protectors and thankfully they are quiet, meaning no crinkle nose what-so-ever. My partner is diabetic and at times sweats so hopefully these will protect our goose down pillows."
2,Ouch,"The belt clip digs into my side every time I sit down or lean in that direction. And like the others have said, your phone will occasionally fall out of the holster. I'm looking for something else now....and you should too."
4,Great for the price,Works perfect and holds my V 505. I have used it for 5 months now.Con: sometimes when you sit down it hurts and you gotta adjust position
2,Starts strong but then dies flat,"The book starts out very well with vivid portrayals of the family life of the ""old country,"" but as soon as the main character lands in the United States, everything becomes a dull stereotype. The story arc and character development stop dead in favor of a series of ""lessons"" that the protagonist learns about American culture. The style of the storytelling also changes from a natural flow to one of pure exposition. Feroza ceases to be a fully realized character and transforms instantly into a MacGuffin being led around from scene to scene. One gets the impression that Sidhwa was trying to portray ""typical"" Americans; however, much like Anurag Mathur (""The Inscrutable Americans"") and Anita Desai (""Fasting, Feasting"") she fails miserably in creating convincing American characters and is clearly out of her depth in her superficial attempts to recreate American speech and manners. The protagonist and her relatives also transform into stereotypes."
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this book, hoping to get some guidance on what it is like to move from a city to a small town. I was so disappointed! It just didn't contain enough 'meat'! It just waffled along with no specific information, except perhaps a few tips on how to actually organise moving house. I wanted more info on moving towards voluntary simplicity, but didn't get it from this book. The whole book kind of reminded me of when I was at school and had to flesh out an essay with lots of waffle, because I didn't really know what facts to put into it."
4,Great Starter Cookbook for Celiacs,"If you're looking for a be-all, end-all cookbook for celiac/wheat free cooking, keep looking. If, however, you are looking for a great starter cookbook that has a great number of quick easy recipes that taste good, then don't hesitate to buy this book. Everything is written for kids, so it's easy to follow and the recipes are super easy and quick. It covers everything from drinks, desserts, to all the staples like dinner, appetizers, and such."
5,A Masterpiece,"Merwin reminds me of America's greatest poet, Walt Whitman, in this sense: His words don't sound like they're coming from a man, but from the heart of the cosmos itself. There's something timeless, primordial about his work. Merwin is one of the most consistently excellent of our great poets. This book is breathtaking."
1,BEWARE! DO NOT PAY $9,"BEWARE! This same product can be purchased from other Amazon sellers for $2.99, which is what the mfg. charges for it. This is flimsy paper and easily torn.Stop Sign Two-Sided DecorationThis was purchased as a gift for my son and we were very disappointed when it arrived."
2,Broken,Wrapped very good but the wooden box was broken before I even used. So now have nowhere for chips or cards
3,Only good for one song,I heard this song (Fist Day Of My Life) on an ice skating show and thought it was beautiful. This is the only CD I could find it on. The CD only has TWO songs and the other one is nothing like this one. I don't care for it at all. About all you can do with this is rip it to another CD that you'll have more songs on.
5,EXPERTLY RESEARCHED AND WRITTEN,"COME SPRING transported this reader to the raw Kansas prairie of the nineteenth century. I was especially drawn to the female characters and their struggle to assist in the settlement of the land, as well as their determination, against heavy odds, that new townships would be a good place to raise a family. These complex women-some connected to the land, some disconnected from the land-brought incredible strength not only to the often traumatic conflict of this struggle, but also to the raising of families without the advantages enjoyed by contemporary society. Still, one senses that these same qualities live even today in modern women, who seek to maintain decent families and homes and communities the world over, regardless what obstacles might confront them. Excellent novel!- ..."
4,As good as you can hope for,"There are some places where it'd be nice to have a few more pictures, but I really can't complain since it lets me do my own maintenance on a motorcycle from 1986. Sure takes a lot of the guesswork out of things."
3,Craig Bierko this isn't!,"The other reviews are of a different recording - that of the recent Broadway revival with Craig Bierko and Rebecca Luker.This is a studio recording starring baritone Timothy Noble. The performance tries hard and includes probably more music than most recordings (including ""Being in Love"" from the film). The main problem seems to be with the tempo. All the songs could be performed twice as fast as the are. While orchestral details might be missing at that speed, the score would get an injection of energy which is what makes this musical work."
2,No Soul,"Timothy Noble, in a word. This guy couldn't sell a rosary to a nun. No character whatsoever, whiney voice in dialogue, and no strength in song. The Music Man is about THE MUSIC MAN, and he ain't it."
5,A Must Read,"This is a great book for someone wanting to read about how and where different plants come from. Ward takes you on a journey of exploration making each of the entries in this book an adventure. I really enjoyed reading about the Sargents and Wilsons of our time and the great plants they have contributed to. I have already found some plants that I can't live without.The photography is first rate making each plant stand out at you with its vibrant colors.This book may not be for everyone, but is well worth a look from master gardeners and those curious about the evolution of plants."
4,Make your agent read this...but you should read,"This is a great resource for dealmaking, but most actors and writers that I know aren't negotiating their own deals. The trick is to get your agent to work harder at creating opportunities, so that they actually have deals to make. Yes, your agent should read this book ... but for myself, as an actor/writer the book HOW TO AGENT YOUR AGENT...is my bible. It helps me kick my agents in the butt ( without them knowing)and I get results...they're working harder and I'm getting work. Also I liked that book with all the casting directors pictures...just in case you see them in Starbucks and want to say hello."
1,"""Secure locking mechanism"" breaks too easy!","""A smooth edge with a rugged locking mechanism provides a firm hold""The supposedly rugged locking mechanism broke on the first five I tried to use just mountain a bike computer to my front forks. As soon as you thread the end through the locking mechanism, it BREAKS and doesn't hold a THING! I suggested to this seller that he send these back to the wholesaler as they are garbage."
4,great gift,"I am getting this book for my mother who loves to knit. Recently we picked up this title from our local library - according to my mom this is the best knitting book she's ever read. My mom is a serious knitting, always trying new design. She knits for my kids, friends and family. She found the instructions very clearly written and the colored illustration visually very pleasing. This book will make a great gift and a welcome addidtion to her knitting library"
3,Beautiful Color,"I'm a beginner, and I bought this book for the beautiful color photos of the pattern designs. I also love the way they show you how different slipped stitches and yarn overs create different looks. But this book is not very good for top to bottom instruction."
1,Instructions are unclear or missing,We got this book from Goodwill for a dollar and after trying to use it now I understand why the previous owner donated it.
3,Not a very helpful buy,"The delivery was very much in time. but I have not been able to use the cable appropriately. I had bought this to connect my laptop to the TV(HDMI). After connecting, the TV has problem detecting the external cable. I have not yet figured out whether it is the TV or the cable's fault."
5,Erotic pleasures,"Ms. Donovan has created a world where the characters come alive and are so vivid, as if you could reach out and touch them. You feel as if you are actually living the story from the hero and heroine's point of view--or at least you wish you were! An erotic read, this one's a keeper."
3,#4 was kind of a bore!,"Suprisingly, this was my 1st ever Clique book. I didn't really expect a whole lot out of it. Overall it was eh okay.There are several things wrong with his book. 1. The plot was misleading. 2. The charcters were not believable sometimes. 3. The book was not creative. Other than that i was entertained just not well entertained. The Nina girl (the cousin from Spain) was believable tho. I also liked the setting. I would not read this again and I would only reccomend this book to people who like regular generic books.Rating: C~Emma,13,CA"
4,book report,"Yes, the characters might be spoiled but hey, who dosent like to be pretty.When Nina came into the story, the book became a page turner. Having her steal Massie's, Claire's, and Alicia's (her own cousin) men is just plain crude. But even meaner when she stole everyone's stuff. In Westchester no one is nice, and in OCD (Octavian Country Day School) it's even worse. Stealing everyone's stuff was a big problem in the book. The way Massie, Alicia, and Claire solved it was awsome. They brought all the stolen items to a school dance and dumped them out on stage, then everybody she stole from was after her.This book is good because it shows was some girls are like and all the drama the other girls go through!"
5,All the clique books,"Im alexa and im in seventh grade like the girls in this book, all the girls at my table (all my best friends) plus a couple of other girls are all reading these books. they were soo good that i finished all 3 in 2 weeks and now i cant wait for the 4th one. There about 4 teenage girls ""the pretty comitee"" who goo through alot of stuff. I think its a great great book and you should really read it. once you start,you can stop. bit i would have to say the third one was the best although u have to read all three to get the hole point of the story. This is probaly the best book i have ever read, and i hope lisi harrison makes many many more!"
4,A Story Full of Surprises,"""Listen to me Jonas. They can't help it. They know nothing."" This is a quote said by The Giver, explaining what he knows about the so-called ""perfect"" community in the book The Giver. The story is about the true pain and pleasure of life. When Jonas is selected to become the new Receiver of Memory, the truth of the community is revealed through the memories that The Giver transfers to Jonas.I really liked this book because it kept me thinking the whole time I was reading it. Also, this book made me realize how much freedom I have each and every day. The community in The Giver is so controlled that they know nothing about the outside world. If you like books full of surprises, this is the book for you."
5,Indispensible for anyone with neck problems,"This book is a truly complete guide to explaining and treating neck problems. Written by an MD in easily understandable language, it does not stop at discussing classical remedies physicians offer for spine problems. It incorporates and validates non-classical methods such as chiropractic manipulations and acupuncture. The best part are the chapters on physical therapy: The exercises are clearly explained and can be understood and performed with or without professional help. I had serious neck pain with nerve involvment, which made it impossible for me to lie on my back without pain. Within a month of doing the exercises(on my own), I am completely pain free and back to my former activities. All of this without one doctor's visit. What a bargain!"
3,No Magic Here,"This book is best suited for the first-time greenskeeper or a greens committee member. It contains basic processes such as top-dressing and stays away from specifics like optimal mower height settings for greens. In addition, this book stays away from prescribing remidies for such things as excessive thatch buildup or constant fungus problems. If all you want are the very basics in management practices then buy this book. If you are searching for innovative and detailed turf management applications then you will need to supplement this book with other references."
2,Disapointing,"Just a bit too big for a standard stove. Didn't like the coating on the pan, couldn't use metal tools and was sensative too much heat. So I returned it."
2,"goods bits, ...","I was hanging out for this album as I'd worn out SCREAMADELICA. Struttin, Funky Jam Rocks, and it's lil brother Jailbird are good but amongst the rest are some the most excruciating, strained vocals, 70s rock wannabe pastiches with cringeworthy rhymes and crap about letting ""your lovelight shine"" etc. Worth a look for those four tracks though."
2,identical...,"poor album. the song 'rocks' is almost identical with any songs of Black Crowers, and even they look alike.and i can't believe is Primal Scream i'm hearing. Primal Scream really has something better to do."
4,Beware the Salt,"Bear Creek Country Kitchens Chipotle Soup Mix is a delicious explosion of flavor. It's great by itself, or you can add things such as corn, jalapenos, sour cream, grated cheddar, chicken, pork, and avocaodo slices.When I eat this soup, I want to have about two cups of it. There are only 110 calories per cup, but there is a problem. One cup of this soup has 850 mg of sodium. That is 36% of the daily value recommneded.Although I love the Southwestern flavor and my family serves chipotle soup to me as a special treat when I am a guest in their home, I find it necessary to warn you about the sodium. The directions say ""salt and pepper"" to taste, but it already tastes a little too salty. The ingredients include MSG, a serious souce of sodium.As our doctors tell us, elevated sodium in our diets is one of the causes of high blood pressure."
3,It Was OK,"I wasn't blown away by the story and happy that I didn't pay for it, it was just ok for me. I read a few of the Colton books so I wasn't totally in the dark about the family and yet as the other reviewer stated it wasn't necessary to read others. I didn't mind as one other reviewer might have that the H/h had relations prior to marriage after all this wasn't a Christian Romance Novel so I expected it. I believe it was tastefully done and they didn't just jump into bed with eachother like so many other characters do.The story seemed more wrapped up in the water poisoning aspect of the story rather than the romance in itself. It was average hence rating 3 stars.I also was confused regarding the name of the ranch being Hopechest and dropping a letter would make it a more suitable name. huh????? Explain yourself please I don't get it.I will read other books by this author if I can find them for free or less expensive to see if this type of writing style is her norm. Enjoy."
1,TCM Greatest Classic Films Collection: American Musicals (The Band Wagon/Meet Me in St. Louis/Singin' in the Rain/Easter Parade,"I bought this product mainly for ""Meet Me in St. Louis"". When I tried to play the DVD on my PC, I couldn't find it. In fact, I could only view ""Singin' in the Rain/Eater Parade"". There were no labels on the DVD, making it harder to identify which movie was where. I tried on a regular DVD player and found ""Meet Me in St. Louis"", but it did not have audio and each scene froze one after another. So, I got to see 5 scenes. It's been a very frustrated experience. I definitely would not recommend this product."
1,two of the same dvds received,"Two of the same dvds were included, instead of two different dvds totaling 4 movies. Now I need to contact and return this item if possible.The quality of the dvds themselves isn't bad, but I didn't get what I paid for."
3,Interesting -- But Mis-titled,"As another reviewer noted, the book spends more time discussing the extirpation of the Cathars than the Cathars themselves.The book makes an interesting read, if only because it documents some of the truly horrible things people can do to each other in the name of religion. Not one of Christianity's finer moments.On the bright side, the book does sink the popular book ""Holy Blood; Holy Grail"", a highly imaginative -- and highly inaccurate -- account covering some of the same events."
1,Disappointing and very derivative,"This book is very, very derivative and relies heavily on French surveys of French Catharism only. Consequently, it does not discuss Italian Catharism, as if Catharism never existed outside France (!), and thus follows a Francophile direction of research never to try to bring into the picture Italian or German Catharism. Worse, although one of O'Shea's major sources, J. Duvernoy, has demonstrated that western Catharism and east Christian Bogomilism formed a unitary movement, O'Shea never even mentions the latter, apart from two or three irrelevant and plainly wrong observations. Readers interested in real Catharism and not the Francophile-inspired vision of O'Shea should try Stoyanov's excellent 'The Other God' or Lambert's''The Cathars'"
3,can you camu?,"it is difficult to say how good this camu camu is, perhaps my body is still adapting it. i am detoxing and doing intentional healing so it is part of a matrix. i will say that this version tastes very intense, rather bitter, while another i had was more tangy, citrus. i like that i can get it in bulk and therefore have an abundance and really let it sink in. one thing i miss with the bulk is no literature or guidelines on packaging."
4,A Good Sample.,"Not having a background in Country music, I was looking for something that would sample recent trends in the genre for a party I was having. I must say the playlist is a lot of fun and many of the tracks are clever and witty, both musically and lyrically. We all had a good time."
4,"Probably a little out dated, but still great for anyone who really works with GPSs","If you are interested in making or modifying maps and using a GPS to do, this is a great resource."
3,more needed,"good book for the most part. however, despite it being reprinted in '04, it is really lacking in up-to-date info for anyone considering electric helis as an entrypoint to the hobby. also, the section on flight simulators is woefully inadequate and in no way reflects what is available today (eg G3, XTR etc).both these two areas have come along in leaps and bounds in the last few years and this book would be more complete if the info were up-to-date. The existence of high-quality simulators with extrememly advanced physics can drastically cut the entry cost for a beginner (i'm talking from experience!) which is an important factor when considering whether or not to take the plunge. that said, it still makes a good read and explains a lot.for those interested in the electric-path here's the latest beginner's guide: http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=439635"
4,Limbic art,"Despite being born in Alabama 20 years after Christenberry, I feel as though we've shared the same experiences. Growing up in Alabama, living for a time in New York City and feeling displaced there, living in D.C. and loving it, even living in Memphis for a while. Returning to this photographic essay periodically, it has the power to bring back long-repressed childhood visions of unpainted rural shacks, kudzu, and poor Southern towns. It is Christmas time as I write this review, and it also reminds me of the happiness of many of those poor Alabama citizens. Perhaps we didn't know what we didn't have and it didn't matter. Or perhaps we did know then that the most important things in life cannot be purchased. If you need a reminder of that truth, and especially if you are from the American South, I recommend this."
3,Misunderstanding in Cali,"This album dropped like a silent bomb in '94, nobody heard. The production is trippin' tab on the tongue hiphop like the dizzy piano groove on ..Feel Me? or the rapid fire drum machine on Battle Drill. Saafir flows roundabout in a way that no else has in the hiphop game. Some may remember him as Cousin Harold in Menace II Society or from his freestyle on Casual's debut CD. This brother is a pioneer of the Bay Area, and he still doing it his own way on the down down with the Hobo Junction."
4,Beautiful in its simplicity,"I saw that an earlier reviewer criticized the illustrations in this book as ""overly simplistic"" and lacking in cleverness. I had to write in myself, because I believe Circle Dogs is one of the most perfectly illustrated children's books in years. The pictures are simple, to be sure, but absolutely brilliant! It takes tremendous artistic sophistication to conjure up a whole world with a few simple shapes and colors. Yaccarino's illustrations draw you into a child's-eye miracle world of shapes and sounds, yaps and slurps and whirlwind motion. And toddlers are utterly entranced. I'm buying another copy to give as a gift right now!"
4,delighted,"We were totally blown away with this. I ordered it so that it arrived just before we left so I didn't have time to set it up prior to our camping trip so I was prepared for the worst but was so amazingly surprised when we set it up on site the first night. It set up in 15 minutes and with some hemming and hawing we figured out where to stow the propane. The net works really well. I love the lantern hanging, we sort of switched the front so that the lantern hanging ins in the front so you can fully illuminate the stove. so cool btw. The only downside we could find is the bugs are so attracted to the light you have to get comfortable with the critters flying around you. It is so great to have the table free as another reviewer noted. I didn't realize just how freeing it was!"
4,Easy to pack away,"I've used this several times now and have found it to be a great addition to car camping. Setting up is easy to do but you do need to be careful when expanding the legs; the rivets holding the cross braces to the legs could easily pop off, or the braces could become bent if you aren't patient during the setup. Same goes with taking it down. Once assembled it is sturdy, not wobbly, our 424 stove fits perfectly on it and doesn't budge. Once it's taken down, all the parts pack away nicely, everything fits as it should and stores with minimal space. The Pack-Away Kitchen was a great buy for us."
5,Telll Me What Its Like to Be Big,"Remember what it was like to be little and wanting to be big! A time when everything would be better if only you were bigger. This heartwarming story is about a bunny named Willa who is very curious about growing up. She gets up very early one morning by herself and realizes she is too little to get breakfast on her own. Willa decides to wake up her brother, Willoughby, who agrees to help her. As he helps her with breakfast, she starts to question him about what it's like to be big. Willoughby patiently answers Willa's questions with older sibling wisdom. The painted illustrations make you feel warm and comfortable. The endpapers remind you of a cozy quilt. All of which remind you of home. Children K-3 will love this story for it's illustrations and the wonderment of what it's like to be older. Adults will love reading it for the nostalgic memories of wanting to be big and knowing what it's like when you finally get there."
5,Nothing else about FileMaker comes near,I'm developing FileMaker applications since 1988. No other book paid for itself in a shorter period of time. I advice everybody who is serious with FileMaker to buy this collection of technique files you find in the accompaigning CD. The first FileMaker book I didn't feel cheated.
2,Better Homes and Gardens Landscaping and Deck Designe Bundle,I bought the software for the landscape design portion. After working with it for several hours I decided it would be easier to cut out pictures and use my trusty architect scale and work with pen and paper. The program was cumbersome to use and was limited with plantings which were not to scale.
1,A children's library book at best,"As you may or may not know, Harry Truman had many random notes and writings and compiled them all into this short book. I found the information to be rudimentary at best. Although it is written in his own words, he says nothing of the human history changing decision to drop the A-bomb on Japan during WWII. Nor does he discuss other important decisions that were put before him during his tenure as president. This book is something I would find in an elementary school library next to Green Eggs & Ham and other such ""books."" I bought this book to understand more about the man who changed so many lives with his decisions during one of the most important times in recent human history and was severely disappointed. I wanted an autobiography, since historians that write books about people are often misinformed and uncredible. Buy this book for your kids when they reach the third grade but otherwise stay clear!"
1,Disappointing,"I ordered this book because I am interested in the person of president Truman, and the years of his presidency. I expected to get more insight about the decision of dropping the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, his dealings with Churchill and Stalin, and the korean war and his relationship with Douglas MacArthur. This book has tells nothing about those subjects, and is overall very sketchy."
5,i love these bloxing gloves,these gloves came in perfect condition with nothing for me to complain about they were a tight fit at first but thats a good thing because that lets me know they were new
2,Not what expected,"Like the other review, I expected something different (""The Tingler"" is battery operated and actually vibrates - much cooler than this ""Happy Head Trip"") and the package had been opened and taped shut. Worst of all, the little copper beads actually had sharp edges!! We filed them down, but it was a big disappointment."
1,Muslimgauze has done this for 15 years already,"I would advise anyone to checkout Muslimgauze. In his 15 + years of creating electro-middle eastern (?) music, he has pretty much done all this before, and he did it better. Tabla Beat's tracks all have the same feel to them.. straightforward and dull. The only good thing I have to say is that this is one of the cleanest and crispest recordings i have ever heard. Muslimgauze is rumoured to have about 130 releases in his career, you might like at least one of them better than this."
2,Not particularly fascinating reading,"I did not really enjoy this book. It was mandatory reading for a college class I was in, so I didn't really have a choice. If I was just reading for fun, I would never read this. Would not recommend it to anyone. However, if you do have to read this book for a course, you should purchase it here because it is at a less costly price than a campus bookstore."
5,Quick to receive and easy to install,"I searched for a good while before I decided on these nerf bars and I was surprised that Amazon's price beat all the truck parts places, by a considerable margin. Even with (slower) free super saver shipping I had them in my hands in six days. They were installed in less than an hour and a half by a guy who never does any auto work, (me). Fit and finish were great and everything went together as advertised. My only quibble is that Amazon's ""check to see if this part fits your vehicle"" feature didn't work; I had to go to Westin's web site to verify that I was selecting the proper model for my 2009 Silverado. Amazon said this part wouldn't fit my truck."
5,Rare Title,There isn't a lot of publication focussed on the Italian Army in WW2 and Osprey's Men-at-Arms series finally decided to include it in its latest book.Philip S Jowett has done a good job in describing the uniforms and rank insignia of the Italian Army and Stephen Andrew's colour plates are of very high quality. An interesting book for WW2 historian and modelling enthusiats. Photos and colour plates are very rare references.I am looking forward to volume II in this series.
3,A BIT DISAPPOINTED,"While Remini has certainly produced some great biographical works in recent years, I was (unfortunately) a bit disappointed in his portrayal of Henry Clay. His account seems to paint a picture of Clay as we would like for him to be remembered, rather than what he actually was. He fails to delve into the forces behind the man, or what 'made him tick,' so to speak. The only book I've read that seems to encapsulate this aspect of Clay is Goedert's ""I'd Rather Be Right Than Be President,"" which I highly recommend. Of course, this is just my opinion -- you can judge for yourself."
4,Good reference but could be better,"The commands and things are in order as you would expect in a reference book but it has no index. Every non-fiction book, except a dictionary, should have a good index. I'm also disappointed by missing items, like =~."
5,Good for cupcakes,This is a good product to make Valentine's cupcakes or any other cupcakes!!! They look super cute with this Sprinkle Mix
3,A Fun Read Despite Unbelievable Plot Twists,"If action was the sole criteria, The Final Kill would be a classic. The problem with O'Brien's novel is that too many things happen that are simply unbelievable. Some of the plot twists are so bad they are actually funny. Also, O'Brien is sloppy when it comes to details. At one point, her main character suffers severe facial injuries that may require plastic surgery. Twenty-four hours later, after fleeing the hospital, she returns home where a friend fails to notice the injuries. A miracle? Perhaps. Despite its many flaws, the book is a fun read. Not only is the action non stop but readers will enjoy the antics of the main character, Abby Northrup, and her former teacher, Sister Helen."
3,MORE LIKE FOG LIGHT,THESE LIGHTS ARE NOT GOOD DRIVING LIGHT.. THEY ADD LITTLE LIGHT TO YOUR DRIVING MAYBE ABOUT 10-15% NOT VERY WHITE ..AND LIGHT SPREDDS LIKE FOG LIGHTS.
4,Replaced my old CD.,I've always been a major fan of Curved Air and the individual solo participants so I had to get this even though I already had it. It is more about Sonja's voice than the music but the musicianship is still of a good standard. I enjoyed all the new stuff and my only quibble is with the reuse of older songs.
4,Somebody Wrote Love,I think that this CD is very good. It is well put together and George Canyon is truely an amazing singer. He is a talent that is upcoming and should be around for a long time. He has a gift for singing as do concert pianist for tickling the keys.
5,Great Statue for all Usagi Yojimbo Fans,This is a statue of young Usagi on the shoulder of his fencing master Katsuichi(Victor). I am not sure when in the series Katsuichi has a hair and beard style like he does in the statue but it is still a damn cool 3D rendering of the two characters.
3,Comments about reviews.,"Please limit your review to the actual book rather than the vitriol that some readers have vented. Such ""reviews"" do not help a potential reader determine whether or not the book is worth reading. One thing for certain is that your reviews are not."
5,A very mesmerizing book on the cruelties of mankind .,"I found this book to be concise summary on the use of torture in our past and present society. It was not overly lengthy in content, but summarized the use of torture both for punishment and 'justice'. The cruelties of mankind toward his fellow man are hard imagine. Often these were undertaken in the name of God. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in this subject."
2,not for a 3 year old!!! POOR GAME OVERALL,"I was really disappointed with this game. I have the diego game for my boys and love it so assumed this would be good too. First of all there is no way a on level 3 year old could play this without really telling him what the answer is. You are given a card for each letter with a picture of something starting with that letter on it. The board has the letters A-Z on it in order and you take and move your pawn to the letter and have to pick up the correct picture that starts with that letter to move on. Thats it, nothing else to it. It will be the same game over and over again. My 6 year old could play this but not a 3 year old like its suggested. Wouldn't waste my money on this again for anyone."
1,Not Much To It,"This game would be good for a child just learning ABC's but for an older child who already knows their ABC's, it's a waste of money. We played this once and my 6 year old daughter was bored immediately. I doubt we will play it again."
4,"Good price, works for a while","I used this protector for months and it was better than previous ones I had tried. The corners started to peel after a while and once that happens, I can't resist the urge to peel it off completely. For the price, it was a good purchase but don't expect it to be the last one you buy."
5,Good quality light,"I purchased 3 of these while it was on sale for $29.99. They look awesome and appears to have good quality.So far, I installed one at the front door entrance and the installation was easy and straight forward. I also purchased a photo-sensor timer control and put in the CFL bulb into this and it works flawlessly.Overall, very happy with the purchase. Well worth the money, in my opinion."
3,Inner Tube,"I built a Bicycle that was perfect for Me back before gas prices expensive and could afford to do the project, It had light weight Lotus Cro-Moly frame and Campagnolo Chorus wheels but that Bicycle was stolen In 2004, So just this year I modified My other Bicycle Not as light weight as the one stolen, It has cheaper hundred dollar wheels Victoria tires 700C X 23 I ordered some Victoria Inner Tube but I damaged both Inner tube tying to Install them then I bought a pair of these slime I got one Installed and damaged the other trying to Install It. It will seal a small hole at low pressure but Not high pressure and If You have to let Air out It will clog up the valve but I do Not know what other brand of Inner tube to get, I was going to take My wheels to a Bicycle shop In Bartelsville but there Is Not any Bicycle shops In Bartlesville any more WarMart did Not have the size of Inner tube I needed so I ordered another pair of Slime and got It to work."
1,Do not buy this for a road bike...the high tire pressure just spits out the slime.,I got a puncture in the tube on the 35th mile of a 65 mile ride. The slime tube STILL ENDED UP FLATTING because the high pressure of the tire just spit out the SLIME and the puncture didn't seal. I've owned Slime tubes for mountain bikes and they work fine for that. I rate it 1 star for road bike use...an absolute waste of money.
1,faulty stem in valve,I purchased 4 tubes for our bikes and the first one I tried to inflate the stem broke off in the pump.
2,"If this doesn't work, there will be slime everywhere","For me, I got a flat and after waiting and pumping it back up it still didn't work. So I pulled out my spare and changed the tire. But the slime got on the tire and I noticed that it was coming out the value too, which made changing the inner tube a mess. I think a better choice is just to use normal inner tubes with a tire liner."
1,Exploded in My Face,"Reading most of the reviews you think this tire was exceptional. However, after installing the tube and inflating the tire the tire blew open my tire spewing green gu all over my hand and bike. Although my hearing is a bit impaired, I was lucky not to have been seriously injured.The warning on the box reads do not inflate to tire's maximum psi - however the label does not indicate the meximum psi level which the tire can be inflated to. A $8 tube has now cost me an additional tires, cleaning, and hearing loss. I strongly suggest you reconsider purchasing this item."
1,Not what I expected,Very poor quality especially the valves. One of them is already broken and unable to fix. Also hard to inflete and the slime liquid easily splash out from the tube making a mess when inflating. Bad purchasing in my opinion. I already changed those tubes
5,Daily Cyclist Not a Park Rider,"I am an experienced Cyclist and know what works. This works unless your puncture is too large to seal. So I always ride on Kevlar tires or Schwalbes. In addition to Slime tubes. Tired of fixing flats at the most ""inopportune times"". I see negative reviews and can see these guys aren't the people you should listen to, period. These products work. I'm happy with them."
1,Very poor,"I got a set of these because I was getting a lot of punctures, now things are worse! I get as many (if not more) punctures but now I have to deal with the green snot too. They are unpredictable, sometimes they seem to have self healed but then after you've set out they go flat again within mins. Also, I noticed they are unbalanced, I guess most of the gunk is in one place. USELESS! (I'm going to try some puncture resistant tires instead)"
3,The cream is great! The shorts were strange,"The cream works! If I use it AND work out, it did make a noticable change in my legs. I am a very normal size 10, so I ordered the shorts accordingly, they were HUGE, and they were a strange shape. I will not be able to use the shorts, but I love the lotion."
3,besy of Dahl,"Great introductory collection of the adult fiction. To fit more in the book, the font size is painfully small. Wait for the Kindle edition (if it ever becomes available). I need a reasonably sized font and this book is almost impossible to read. If you have great eyesight, get it!"
2,Cool if you are into competition or performance,"Honestly, I enjoyed watching this video. The bloopers were great, too. But I really didn't care for the combos so much. None of them would I use on any social dance setting. I am into performances, but I would rather watch Emily Alabi, Salsa y Control (Johnny and Andres Giraldo), Cobo Brothers, Al Espanoza, or Eddie the salsa freak. On the other hand, I really don't like salsa competition (namely Mayan salsa competition).Is this video entertaining? Yes. But do I find it useful? No!On top of that the music selection for this video is very bad."
2,"pretty book, but disappointing","This book is very pretty, and nicely done; was shipped perfectly, but is disappointing in content. It doesn't involve any drawing lessons, just lots and lots of images of how others have done it, and then only the finished product. Not a drawing book at all, just a book of drawings(and paintings). Lovely, but not what I wanted, will be returning this one."
2,Updated Monopoly - not updated fun,"My family gathered to play this game and I expected it to put some new twits into a game we've played for years. While the properties, chance and community chest have been updated, we soon realized the dollar values were just a straight multiplier of the original game. There were no new surprises in this game. No new twist on the old classic. I'd advise everyone to stay with the original unless you really need a new game."
3,"Needs improvement,but still FUN","This game is a break from the traditional Monopoly game, I like the new spaces and the landmarks from around the Nation. I couldn't help notice a few things that I would have done differently:1.Make the paper money larger for ease of handling2.A lazy susan for the deed cards (like in Monopoly Deluxe Edition)3 The game board be folded in 2 sections instead of 4 (less creases)4. make the tokens larger (my friend has big fingers had a hard time moving his token)Other than this i have to say that the game was still fun and challenging, and really cool to land on known landmarks instead of the traditional street names.If anything grab this game and leave it wrapped as a collector item (as it was a limited edition!"
3,typical monopoly with a little twist,I like that it is modernized but the dollar amounts are crazy too many zeros and tough for a 6 and 9 year old to keep track of the dollar amounts on their own. Regular monooply is no problem for them.
3,Like the original better,"It was too weird to count the higher bills. I think that is the only thing I didn't like about it and 1 million and 100,000 bills were almost the exact same color. I did like the property choices and the community chest and chance."
4,Doesn't suck......,"Michael Sonbert has a pretty twisted mind. I would hate to be alone with him in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere. I would have nightmares of the possible ways he would revert into a serial killer and dream up insane ways of how to kill me and manifest my body into his own scientific experiment. The scary part is while he would be disecting me he would be watching Three's Company and drinking a beer. Seriously, I love the thought and deranged creativity Sonbert uses to paint his stories. Very original and extremely violent. Think Clockwork Orange meets My Own Private Idaho."
5,Loved it!,"Great read, a little melodramatic, but realistic nonetheless. Reminds me of Fate is the Hunter."
1,childish music,go buy something else (just make sure that its from century media records). this trash is not representative of the label. just look at the logo! it looks like some football thing!
2,"Artsy, self-absorbed British queen","Readers can be from the unsophisticated midwest, ""get"" Simon's windows, and still think they look like the work of a high school art class in both sensibility and execution. Really, how did this guy con New York into thinking he's the last word in naughty, avant garde window dressing. I couldn't bear the author, the layout, the lack of index...anything."
4,A fun melding of the old radio seriels and Star Wars,"Listening to this tape, I had the feeling this is what it must have been it must have been like for my granparents to listen to radio shows like ""The Shadow"" or ""The Long Ranger"". Raised on TV, it was odd at first to sit and listen to a story. Being used to visual stort-telling. To my surprise it was not difficult to let my mind create the visuals. The cast and crew of these tapes go a long way help you along. If you are ever in a nostalgic mood or would like a fun was to survive a rainy day, GET THESE TAPES!!!! Fun for all ages ;-)"
5,Great read,Very inspirational! I found my self cheering for Beth and Noah. Kathleen Morgan brought age old life struggles to life in time when many of these topics were kept secret.
4,Ending superb,"This book in the series was not my favorite of the four, but the ending was wonderfully uplifting . Two thumbs up!"
5,Child of Promise,I've enjoyed reading all of the books by Kathleen Morgan and this was a very good book.
5,History Again,"This is the fourth book and last one in the series.It is well written but seems to get a slow start in the first chapter, but then picks up and keeps the reader interested in it. Once you pick it up you can't seem to put it down. I can't wait to see what happens in her next book.If you enjoy reading a series about a family and how they came to our country, and what happens to them and all the characters they meet along the way you are really in for a real treat in this book."
2,Had to purchase new one but don't like how long they last,We are using this type of blower on coal stove so its running during the cold season. The first one stopped within months (not purchased here) as it came with stove. Coal stove replaced it for free. Next year the fan stopped mid season again. Replaced this one as well and now in 3rd season my 3rd blower. It runs well but they just don't seem to last. None of the above were purchased through Amazon. The reason I got it here was cheaper price overall then from specialty stores. If I find a replacement blower not from dayton I would be happier but had no heat for several days and this was quickest way to get.
3,"Good energy flow, kind of slow, soothing toons for the soul.","I loved the CD. The only down was that after the first two songs, it slowed down a lot. But the more I listened to it, the more I found the orgin of the songs and what he was trying to say. It relates to anyone with a half empty heart and all lonely people. I highly recommend it."
5,Great new acoustic vocalist,"Shawn Mullins' style of storytelling with catchy melodies and great chorus' is really enjoyable. Unlike most new pop CD's, the lyrics on this one are pretty meaningful as well. A good CD that won't get old."
1,Too folksy for me.,"I loved the spruced up version of Lullabye I heard on the radio, so I bought the CD. I really wasn't prepared for the coffeehouse feel of the CD version of that song or the rest. They bore me!"
1,not satisfied,"I'm not sattisfied with my purchase. Today I received my magnifying glasses because I live in Argentina and I had to wait till my friend traveled to NYC to pick up my purchase. I bought magnifying glasses 2.2x and I received 2.0x, 0.2x less than what I purchased. I wish to have an answer from the seller. Thank you very much"
3,Sorry but..,I have read many Ellora's Cave books and I do have to say I was disappointed in this one. This story could have easily been a great read but it lacked so much between!Sorry
4,Now Batting for Boston,"Really enjoyed this book of short stories. The characters came alive and were portrayed in a heartfelt, believable way, despite the constraints of a short story format. Although set in Boston, the stories have a universal appeal anywhere in our world."
1,Poorly written hagiography,"This is an excellent example of the cutlish, doltish approach many ""objectivists"" take to Rand. For the true believers, it is ""good"" because it reinforces their beliefs. For thinking people on any side of the Rand debate, it is just another simpering example of group-think."
3,Portugues Basico para Estrangeiros,This is a very good book for the those who want to learn the basic Portuguese in a short period of time. It comprises the most needed basic expressions to communicate in Portuguese.The video cassette and the audio tapes are a good and useful complement to the book. I recommend it for beginners who want to learn the basic most useful and most commonly used sentences and idioms.
5,My Toilet Works!,"Used this for my sailboat toilet. I had the same version in the boat but after many years (owned the boat for 5 years, but my guess is the one currently in my boat is at least 10 years old) of use and abuse it was just 'pooped' out. I got the same model as a replacement and its flushing strong again. Works great!"
5,"I'm in trouble now. I need ""The Dead""","I didn't plan to expect too much from this ""older work"" but it's great. And I'm not saying that because the author and I share the same name.My problem, now, is that I need the next book to continue the story! Anyone out there have ""Morigu: The Dead"" that I can borrow or buy? I had to search three online book stores before I found a used copy of this one."
5,MORE!!!,A series that absolutely HAS to be completed! One of the best fantasy reads ever--but not for children.
2,Definitley multi-region friendly,"The code to make this product region-free/multi-regional definitley works and lets you play a DVD from a different region. However, when i sat down to watch an English DVD the picture was in black and white. I then tried this on another TV in our apartment and the picture definitley got more entertaining. It was black and white and the picture was off center and scrolling down the screen.If you want a cheap DVD player to play-back your US DVD's then this product will definitley suit your needs. If you are like me and want to have a DVD player that plays back DVD's from different regions then i certainly advise you to stay clear of this product."
1,The Windsor Beauties Ladies of the Court of Charles II,I was very disappointed in this book. The illustrations were grainy and hardly able to make out who was being pictureedThis book was not worth what I paid for itI purchased the book on Amazon
1,Doesn't work with Mac,"The description says it will work with a MAC. It does not. After talking with the apple help desk, there is only one way to install it and it requires purchasing another software that could damage other programs on the computer."
3,Dissapointment because of the size:(,It is such a great watch BUT on the screen it looked and said bigger.When I got it I saw that it is not!!!:(
1,the worst thing I have ever bought on amazon,"I will admit that I am literally the biggest computer idiot on God's green earth, but when my husband, who has a masters degree in information technology, (and as much common sense as a man can have) can't even delete a single picture out of this program, you know something is not right. You can only upload one picture at a time. Who has time for this? The program crashes at will, so you literally have to save after doing something as simple as rotating an image. I never got a single page finished before I threw it out. In the time it took to installed, wiped it from my hard drive because it crashed every time I tried to open it, reinstall, I could have finished at least 6-10 pages of regular paper scrapbooking. UGH! This program is awful. I gave it one star because there was not an option for zero stars."
2,Alex O'Loughlin Episode,"I bought this because I found out that Alex O'Loughlin started his multi-episode appearance on it. I didn't watch the whole show. There are no good guys, only bad and really bad cops. Alex was okay, but even he couldn't make me enjoy it."
4,Very informative and comprehensive,"Wow, this book has a LOT of information. Almost too much, actually. Inevitably, a book covering such a wide range topics, goals and lifestyles is bound to gloss over a bit here and there, which this book does occasionally. That would be the reason for loss of the fifth star.But if you're looking for very informative book that will guide you to becoming very healthy, fit and strong (but not necessarily Men's Health model ""cut"") then this is the book for you.It was first published about 10 years ago, so it's not ultra modern, but I don't think that really a drawback. The information is pretty timeless. Eat right and exercise. And this book will show you how."
4,its ok,"it takes time to get the right settings, but out would flawlessly. of course it isn't going to be as good add a modified camera for ir shots, but it does a decent job if you don't want to spend the money to convert your camera"
5,OMG they talk about a night and day difference....,"This exhaust system is loud and mean, and I'll tell ya I even get looks from the tried and true Harley riders. Funny I have a sportster/ roadster kinda a little buell mixed with Harley. Anyway, my bike shitz and gitz down the road followed up with the thunderous undertone of these monster pipes...totally happy, had Harley put em on for me, with porting and tuning....just awesome...try em out for yourself, u will not be disappointed...believe it!"
2,"Fit after the first wash, but not after the second",These shrank something fierce after a couple of washes in warm/hot water. The legs just became too tight to wear.
5,will purchase again,"Love these. First time purchasing, fit well and comfortably. They seem well made much better than multipack undies from a box store. Flattering and wash and dry well. Pefect everyday functional underwear."
5,Refreshing sound from Birmingham,"Gogue's Some said it Thundered picks you up for a trip from Ballads to Rock, and drop you off at the end with a sense of freshness and renewal. Goodbye Mr McKenzie and If are entertaining and punchier. The first track Don't Go Away sets the pace for an first excellent album of this local band. BUY IT!"
5,Invisible Standout,"One wants to believe in critical merit, in the general public's good taste, but when an album like ""Ancient Ritual"" is all but ignored, it's hard to resist cynicism. Not much to report past that. The fact is that Mr. Simmons returned to the scene after a long hiatus and produced a standout album. A gas from top to bottom. Cooks and swings...and that is something all too rare in contemporary jazz. Spread the word."
4,my first venture into the series,"Castlevania: AoS is a very fun game. i like the action oriented gameplay, the variety of weapons, and the super-cheesy character dialogue. it's open-ended, so you never have any clue where you're supposed to be going, but in a rather fantastic, positive way, you usually end up somewhere accomplishing something.i find the only negative thing about the game to be it's length. it was very short, taking me less than five hours to complete. i would like more game time than that, kiddies. otherwise, though, very good."
5,breathtakingly amazing,"my 3 favorite castlevania titles are SOTN,dracula x, and now aria of sorrow. castlevania should stay a 2-D game [forever!!!] i cant see it any other way. ( we proved that with n-64)"
2,a real disappointment....,I was really looking forward to this edition of Gene's book but I found it lacking in many areas. The patterns are not as easily distinguishable as in his earlier books and he has left out major patterns that were available in those earlier books as well. It doesn't seem he has put the effort in this edition that he had put in all the previous ones.
2,Kind of Cheesy,"I guess I was expecting more from it. Don't get me wrong, it will make you bow in the right place, but it seems more restrictive than it should be. I guess if you're not taking lessons from someone then it could help."
4,Actually works,A little tricky to get used to but does work. It has made me bow straighter and if I don't it gets pinched and won't allow the bow to move.
2,not safe for valuable instruments,"The device is easily hooked over the instrument's purfling - from which it will remove chunks when one tries to remove it after use. My mistake was in putting it on a somewhat valuable instrument, which was permanently marred, despite my great care in the process. (Yes, it guides the bow reliably.) USE THIS DEVICE ONLY ON A BEGINNER'S OR AN ALREADY CHIPPED VIOLIN!"
5,Great Product,I have been using a Mio C220 for almost two years now and it is a piece of junk compared to the Garmin 680. My unit came with 2008 maps even though 2009 maps are avalible. Once I registered it I could download 2009's maps. You must register it within 60 days of your first sattelite acquisition. If you don't get the prompt for your free map update then just call Garmin. You can forward them your order invoice and then they will set it up for you.
2,Don't get this unit if you live in Los Angeles!,"I'm not one to write reviews of things, but this unit has pissed me off so many times in the years that I have had it that I felt like I needed to vent. First off the MSN free year was useless, it worked about once or twice. The other major issue I have is that it picks the absolute worst routes throughout the city of LA. Since when was zigzagging through hollywood, making multiple left turns faster than going straight down a road and making one left turn? I have it set on the fastest route possible, but honestly, it picks the slowest route more often than not. Also the freeway interchanges are often confusing, saying stuff like stay on the 110 North and then at the last minute it'll say take the 110 South, causing you to get into a near accident. The unit does eventually get you to your final destination, but don't count on it being a logical route."
3,Navigation unit fine - let down by Microsoft,"The unit is very easy to get to grips with and the routing system seems to be pretty well optimized. It also plays nice with my iPhone as a bluetooth handsfree unit. The only gripe I have about it is the speaker is not very good compaired to the TomTom Go unit I previously owned.However the MSN traffic system is useless. Although I live in the coverage area, and my place of work is pretty much in the centre of the coverage area, the MSN unit refuses to pick up any information unless I unplug it and pass it up and over the top of the passenger seat, which is impractical as best, seeing as how it also doubles up as the Nuvi's power cord & charger..If you want a Garmin unit, i suggest buying the Nuvi 650, or perhaps the 660 / 670 with the FM traffic option. They are pretty much the same hardware as the 680, but without the MSN headache. I would give the unit 5 stars, but the MSN thing drags it down to 3."
2,"No good,","I got problems with the speakers one week ago after starter to use it, go to mute automatically some times, the FM does not work properly, the sound is very low quality, the main difficult that I find for practical use the Bluetooth's Tech block my cell phone, also my partner's cell phone in my car, I need to desconnect the GPS to talk by phone. I setup 20 times the cell phone with the Nuvi, I needed to call technical support two times, with very bad Customer Service(30 and 40 minutes waiting for talk with the Garmin's representative), finally they said me your equipment has problem with the speakers, send us to repair in 10 days. Meanwhile I have not my ""wonderful"" Nuvi 680, I need every day to visit home around Florida's State. Really I will not recomend to my friends. Ed PridaEd Prida"
4,Garmin NUVI 680,"I bought this unit for a trip to the Washington DC area and a trip to the mountains in W. North Carolina and on to Savannah. Overall I am pleased with the performance. One address that we entered for Arlington, VA it could not locate. At other times it didn't know where the address was located on a street when the address was new. In the first case, we knew an address that was close and we knew how to find the address from that point. In the second case, it was a simple task of looking for the name of the business as we drove down the street. The Garmin worked very well in taking us through a maze of twisting streets to our location. On the freeway it would warn which side of the road to exit or which lanes to be in for a split. The MSN service worked well for traffic congestion in metro areas and we didn't use the service for gasoline prices. The blue tooth would not work with our LG phones.Garmin nüvi 680 4.3-Inch Widescreen Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator"
5,Excellent device -- hard to beat,"I think this product works just as a GPS should work -- accurately and simply. The screen is outstanding. The computer is fast doing recalculations and so far, no misdirections. The only fault I find is that the device MUST be plugged in to the cigarette lighter to use the MSN traffic and weather functions. I did not realize the FM receiver was in the charger and not the device itself. This somewhat defeats the ""cordless"" aspect of the device. But it's so much better than OEM systems in cars -- not to mention quite a bit less expensive.Update -- a little con: there is a flaw in the text to speech function. The computer voice reads ""Dr."" as ""Doctor"" not ""Drive"" -- that's understandable, except when refering to traffic directions!"
4,Garmin 680,The product is great overall. Lots of options. MSN Direct needs some improvement. I would buy it again and recommend it to others who looking for a full feature GPS.
3,It's OK,I feel it's a little too slow and also take me to the wired direction... The calculation system hang pretty often... take more than 2minutes to search the places... but I'm doing fine with it just take longer time to deal with it.
3,Pretty Butterflies,"They are not too small and not too large. They are very pretty, and they are a nice shade of purple. They didn't cost too much. They are, however, way too heavy. I've had my ears pierced for many many years now and they don't have those elongated drag marks because I don't wear heavy earrings so I know I won't be wearing these often at all. And I also know I won't be gifting them to the 8 year old I'd originally planned to give them to. Too bad. Good Quality though."
5,Sterling Silver Gemstone Butterfly Earrings,"These earrings ended up being the perfect size! They go great with almost everything! I like to wear them with black, brown, and white! They add a boost of color to any outfit! I absolutely love these earrings!"
5,Quality and Beauty,I purchased the earrings during a gold box savings deal. Every time I wear them I get compliments. Excellent buy for a gift.
2,Not what I expected,The 2 choices for the butterfly earrings were garnet and amethyst. I ordered garnet...should be dark red...they are pink! The person I ordered them for hates pink...not what I expected!
1,Disappointed,"I wish I had come to Amazon.com to read the other review here first.Although I've had mostly positive experiences with this brand, the Dulce de Leche flavor is so watered down and faint I can hardly tell if the flavor is even remotely accurate. I tried a spoonfull of this out of the bottle and I basically detected flavorless syrup sweetened with splenda and a hint of something that might have potential had the flavor been stronger. I used the syrup to make pancakes."
2,Never worked,"It looks great, but it is Chinese made, and none of the bulbs work. I wired it, checked all grounds and that the bulbs were getting power. That being said...it looks snazzy and I've not been pulled over since I replaced my ""working"" but too ""small for legal reasons"" lights. Buying new bulbs is more expensive that the unit and I've cut the wires to fit my trailer, no return available for me. I only drive during the day anyway."
3,Pretty good game!,"This is a great game but is hard to use. I use an XP and the only game i can get to coroperate is NFS HP2. The other games are hard to work. If your are planning to save money, i wouldnt buy the colleacton (unless your useing a XP). But if your willing to take a risk, i would do it (even better with a 98)."
5,Amazing tale of good versus evil,"Molly is saddled with a moronic older brother, a games freak younger brother and an imagination that is belied by her too sensible face and red hair. When she writes a mock advert for 'Quests undertaken', she doesn't realise that she will soon be thrust into an age old feud as she is chosen to care for Floris.Annie Dalton writes eloquently and with beauty. Out of the ordinary draws you into Molly's life, filled with her mother's fosterlings and into the magical world that she is drawn into. The prose moves along with an almost dreamlike quality and the characters make you laugh and cry with them. A must read for any fan of the slightly surreal."
4,unexpected plus,"This book was a bit out of the ordinary but the mix of science fiction, parallel universes, romance, and wonderfully portrayed characters its a very good read. Molly is the out of the ordinary girl who seems oh so ordinary."
5,A Great Album by Davis and Paich,"This Cdis one of the best examples of a happy collaboration between a singer and an arranger.Sammy Davis is in top form as a Jazz vocalist and arranger Marty Paich,makes use of his ""Tentet"" sound with great musicality,Fantastic renditions of tuneslike:Blame it on my youth,Bye Bye Blackbird,Let it be Love shows Davis' swinging vocal aptitude along with Paich's West Coast smooth jazzy counterpoint.A marvelous CD."
3,desert eagle,okay when i first got this gun i was happy my first semi aautothis is a good gun but you gotta get a set of good tripple Asand itll work great just dont screw with the action much or itll jamvery nice and hopefully lasts longe rthen ive heard
5,"the greatest game ever - seriously, it is","i thought a sequel to golden sun would spoil it - they'd never be able to make anything like golden sun again, that game was just incredibleI was wrong - this game is even better than the firstthis isnt just some lame sequel where they kill the whole thing - hang on it wasn't exacly a sequel was it... well anywaythe storyline is elaborated on a lot, and takes so many different turns in here, and the ending totally owns all.This had to be the best storyline i ever seen, in a game, movie novel or whatever...anyone who dissed this game, youre pretty much dissing my religion! well maybe not quite but still.... ok nevermindthe musics good, the gameplay is fun, graphics are very nice - but the story of this game is just amazingeveryone should play it, it is THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!"
5,this is a good game,"This is a good game! First of all, this is a good game^_^ Second of all this is a good game THen if you pass the game this is a good game and also if beat a boss it turns out to be a good game ^_^ good gam e ggood game GOOD GAMEEEEEEE!!!!! AHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,cool!!!!!!!!!!,"golden sun 2 continues the story from the first game. You start out as Felix, Jenna, Sheba, and Piers (a new chracter) instead of Issac and his party. There's a lot more puzzles and some can get quite frustrating...There's also 44 more djinns to collect. You also ""earn"" new summon spells instead of the ones from GS1. You can also transfer data from your old game to GS2 (as long as you have a ""clear data"". I'm almost done with the game and so far it's pretty good! Since I transfered my old data to the new game, I have too much money...(i had 999,999 coins in the first game, no cheats!) It's an awsome game if you're interested in rpg's. GO GOLDEN SUN 2: THE LOST AGE!!!!!!! W00T!!!!!"
2,Don't waste your money!,"Our travel reading was limited to Frommer's, Moon, and Lonely Planet. After reading the reviews on this new source, we bit. I'm convinced the author's relatives must have provided the ""positive"" comments!This guide might be helpful to the Jamaican backpacker who desires the ""$8 a day experience."" If your desire is the more upscale visit, we suggest your choice of guides from the tried and proven professionals listed above."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this book with the hopes of making myself ""normal"" in my eyes, and accepted by my friends and family. I read the book and applied its theories and techniques only to be disappointed in the end when it does not remove homosexual desires it only gives advice on repressing and hideing those desires for other people's sake. All those desires and feelings are still there. It did not create an attraction to women, or remove or reduce my attraction to men. The author even states this at the end that you will be struggling to fight your homosexual attraction for the rest of your life. It is not a ""cure"" only advice on hideing your thoughts and feelings so other people won't be offended by your existence. It is not a cure at all, so don't buy it if that is what you are looking for."
1,Just Say NO!,"This book was given to me by a co-worker recently, who thought they were doing a ""good deed"" - HIGHLY UNPROFESSIONAL, not to mention rude. The contents in this book are mean and untrue written under the umbrella of the Catholic religion - that would somehow make the judgements of this book ok to be made. Don't buy this book, don't waste your time, don't put yourself on an emotional rollercoaster based on someone elses JUDGEMENTS."
4,A Son Remembers,This book was written to provide an understanding of the different ethnic groups that make up America to young children growing up in multiracial communities. This is a very good book to read and discuss with a child (age 6 - 10) as to why there are differences in skin color and hair style/texture and cultural activities.
4,"Great series, excellent DVD set","Watching the black and white episode (when David and Maddie have separate dreams about a crime that took place back in the 1940's) brought back a lot of memories for me. How great the writing was on this show. How much I thought David was the coolest character on TV. And lastly, how great the two character's chemistry was. The 6 disc set will bring back lots of memories for those of you who loved the show and will be refreshing to those that only know the post Die Hard (or even post Pulp Fiction) Bruce Willis. Must buy if you enjoy 80's TV shows. Now if only Family Ties could be out on DVD....Last note, would have liked 1 or 2 more extras to be included in the set (perhaps they are being saved for future DVD releases). Also, would have liked to have seen Cybil and Bruce be in the same room at the same time when they were being interviewed to see if they still HATE each other. :)"
2,Time has not been kind to this show.,A wonderful show in the 1980's is not as funny in 2005. I loved this show but I found it very hard to watch on DVD.
3,took 3 weeks to receive the DVD,3 weeks for a DVD to arrive is a long timespecially if its within the US
4,Fun,"I didn't know what caption to give this, so I settled on ""fun."" My first viewing of ""Moonlighting"" was on the DVDs, having missed it when it ran on TV.Ms. Shepherd is certainly beautiful to behold, and, unlike many runway models, she has acting talent and intelligence. She is what makes this work--for me, at least. Mr. Willis isn't bad (pardon the litotes), but the writers made him just a bit too smart-mouthed with the wisecracks. That wasn't the actor's fault.The stories are full of action, which sometimes or often takes the place of genuine drama. Unfortunately, moviemakers frequently do this, and perhaps that is what many viewers want. Real drama takes place behind the eyes and countenance of good actors, not in gun duels or fistfights. Alas, subtlety is lost on many.That said, this is fun to watch, to pass some idle time."
4,All time classic !!,"What can i say ?? I am a Monnlighting fan and this is what i have been expecting for some years.A minor complaint. The extra features could have been better with more behind the scenes, bloopers, deleted scenes, interviews.Anyway... I am waiting for the rest of it!!"
5,Blast From The Past,"Viewing this series was a blast from the past. The DVD set was very good and easy to watch and enjoy. If you can wait until December/January for your DVD purchases, you can end up getting an excellent deal....40-50% off."
5,Jazz Guy Autumn Picks (...),"The influence of Miles Davis on Wallace Roney is profound, and has been, for Roney, both a blessing and a curse. Those who revere Davis will, for this reason, either embrace this album or be offended by it, but, for me, there is no offense given by an album which is as nearly flawless as this one is, filled with mysterious,darkly beautiful, deeply-felt music. The spirit, if not the letter, of Miles lives on in Roney, and that is an undisguised blessing."
4,"Funky, Groovy and Modern","The whole sound mix is like contemporary R&B;, quite familiar to young people.Slow to up tempo, the sound of sexy sax fits every style.Funky bass line and its characteristic electric sound make it more fun."
1,Waste of money,"This air rifle has crude construction, sights that won't stay put, is dificult to load, and is much weaker than the reviews indicated (must have been writen by a seller). I would have done better to go to wally world and bought a cheap Daisy, I wouldn't be risking my fingers every time I loaded it and would have similar power and accuracy (maybe even better)."
3,Good for the price,"I received the first rifle and the sights were so bad off I had to have them send me another one. The second rifle was a lot better. For the price you pay for this, it is a pretty good rifle. However, I highly recommend purchasing a scope with it as it will make the rifle a lot better for aiming. Toolsnow customer service was very excellent. Got replacement rifle no problems and shipped fast."
4,Great book,Joyce recently mentioned this book a few times so I thought I'd hunt one down and luckily I found it here on Amazon. It is good and mostly basic information but still great to remember what we learned when we were first Born Again and need to never forget!!
2,Not impressed,"Every time I check the tire pressure or try to put air in the tire, slime shoots out. Eventually it clogs the valve and I need to take it out and clean it. Also, it gets into the tire pressure guage and pump so I need to clean them out. I've read that I need to put the valve at the 10 o clock position and wait a few minutes before putting air in, but this doesn't always help. I got this because I bike to work and I needed a reliable tire, but this is definitely more of a pain than it's worth. VERY heavy too. I noticed the weight difference right away. I'm going to look for an extra thick tube minus the slime next time."
3,Interesting but poorly researched,"Overall it is a nice summary of the Italian forces in Africa and Ethiopia during WW2. Good information on events, nice pictures of uniforms and some good photos but I was very disappointed with the research into the order of battle. For example, it states that 22 medium tanks were sent to Africa Orientale (Ethiopia) before the outbreak of war when in fact it was 24 medium tanks that were sent. And for its descriptions of the Libyan battalions in North Africa it clearly conflicts with the Italian Official History on North Africa. You would think that a book on the Italian Army would use the Italian Official histories as a basis for research which would have avoided these mistakes."
3,Great Concept But Lots of White Space on Pages,"This great concept (which is clever when published in magazine form) has not been expanded at all in book form. Instead the book is just made up of old magazine clips, some of which are only a few sentences long. That leaves an awful lot of white space on the pages!In many of the cases the writers could not truly answer the question of what's the most overrated and underrated, so they ""cheat"" by naming the same thing to both categories, naming multiple winners or (in one case) not naming anything at all! Why didn't the publisher push to have the magazine pieces expanded and better explained? Or created some new pieces that were more introspective.As is it reads like little magazine clippings, which are sometimes clever but always leave you wanting more."
4,A Lively and Useful Introduction,"Characters in ActionMarsh CassadyThis was the first book I read on the art of playwriting and I found it rather inspiring. Cassady stresses tapping into your unconscious for dialogue and plot-connection ideas, he considers all the basics from stage directions to proper script presentation, and gives a wide variety of interesting examples that show that he knows what he's talking about. He also uses the literary device of having made-up characters break into the text to dramatically illustrate his points. I could not find fault with this book as a primer for writing live drama. The book should also be of interest to fiction writers and screenwriters who to hone their art and expand their horizons. A lively and useful introduction."
4,Very Informational,"I found the information, historical research and data to be extremely educational as a studying naturopath. My only constructive feedback is the occasional subjective (instead of objective) approach to describing and writing about traditional medical physicians' handling of symptoms and signs related to dietary responses. The style of writing made me feel like I was hearing an angry and frustrated ""outburst"" from the author instead of a factual recitation of statistical realities - which could have the same impact if written well. Overall - the book will be an often-referenced tome in my naturopathic library."
3,Not for 5-8 year olds,I purchased this book to read to my 8 year old to start the conversaton. Luckily I read through it first. The book graphically explains sex which I believe is too much information for children 5-8 years old. The pictures are inappropriate (one is the frontal view of a baby being born). I skimmed the book when I read it to my 8 year old but did read it to my 12 year old who it is more appropriate for. Very disappointed.
3,Note for Kindle users,"I just purchased this to read with my daughter and am disappointed that the artwork for the kindle is black and white, not color, as is the printed edition. Just wanted to let others know as this may sway your decision as to which format to buy. My rating is based upon this fact and not the content of the book."
5,tasteful and factual,"This is the book I've been trying to find. It presents the material in an age-appropriate manner, and the matter of fact delivery removes the stigma which we parents can unconsciously pass on to our kids when discussing sex. It is not graphic and it does not go into more detail than is necessary for a 7 year old child."
1,For god fearing folks only!,"This book is way too heavy on the god aspect and ignores far too much of the magic of being human.My four year old already understands the reality better than this book can teach and it would be downright confusing to introduce all the ""god"" hocus-pocus at this stage.Don't underestimate your children!"
2,whent down hill,"i liked the begin and the interesting premuse in the book, the ature showed potental to paint vivied pictures in ones mind, though is lacking in the showning all sides of the charaters at ones is stead of spreeding them over a life time. the book jumped in its position of relating to reality, which could work but somehow by the end just wasn't there.it isn't a book i've passed on to others to read."
1,More about sex than identity,"I found the parts of the book about the flexbility of identity and race interesting. The boy liquidly moves through the novel adapting to new classes, races and environments. He demonstrates the poignant struggle to be oneself and part of one's culture and the simultaneous desire to be ""other"". However, this book/narrator/author is fixated on sex. The boy's life seems to revolve around sex more than the aforementioned issues, and the discussions about sex have absolutely no reason to be in the novel. In fact, it draws away from the momentum. There are parts where the narrator is describing a person in an insightful and interesting way, but then throws in a comment about the man's ""pulsating bulge"" or something equally ridiculous. I don't have problems with sexuality or sexual novels, but it had absolutely no point in this book and drew away from the central issues of class and race. And you'll notice to book is heavily discounted... Hm..."
2,Beware Shoddy DVD transfers!,"I had always looked forward to seeing these films, being an avid Karloff and Lugosi fan, but I'm not avid enough to sit through this DVD. The print they used for THE APE (Karloff) must have been spliced 4,726 times: the sound and picture both jump all over the place. APE MAN (the Lugosi film) fared somewhat better, but God knows how many generations existed between the negative and this DVD. The picture is very dark and indistinct and sound is muffled. Surely with a little time and diligence they could have come up with better source material!"
5,Book was fine!,"I did not think I was getting the red and blue covered book of this version of Decor...etc. 1-2-3-... I bought the gold and got the other one....which I wanted anyway....SSOO...I was happy anyway.Although I did by two one from another vender who had also listed the red & blue covered book shown on his site...which I wanted...I am happy and sold one to a friend happy ending.All in allI got what I wanted.I love this book...its the best book for many faux job choice's and styles...I bought 10 books in all, now I can not make up my mind which Faux to go with.This is the best step by step book to follow..and at a great price.YOU will be happy with this book!"
4,Review for Energy Suspension Leaf Spring Isolator,This replaces my 50 year old leaf spring isolator in a '63 Chevrolet Nova convertible. It is a quality piece and I would not hestitate to recommend it for purchase.
3,For Shallow/Small Heads,"Not the best made hat.I would say that I have an average-large sized head,and the hat is almost unwearably shallow on me."
2,Is this a textbook?,"For me personally this was marketed as a book for the average Joe (at least by the title, the cover, and even the ""blurb"" on the book jacket) however it read like my science textbook from college. Unless you have an affinity for the sciences you may end up completely lost and in a fog. If you want to know in depth the science behind low carbing this is it. No doubt about it. However I will have to read the book probably 3 more times to ""get it"". If you want to know more than a little bit but not as much as God himself then I recommend instead going with Protein Power or Carbohydrate Addicts or even Atkins. All those books explain the same thing. Not in as much detail but unless you have a degree in chemistry you may not even understand what these authors are talking about. That is just me though...I don't have the attention span for textbook reading."
2,Circular reasoning,"The book is about carbohydrate restriction, and I agree with the effectiveness of carbohydrate restricted eating habits for weight loss and good health. However, in this book the authors make conclusionary remarks without really any significant analysis. They will cite a study and then come up with a conclusion without really describing the details of the study or how and why they reached the conclusion that they did. Many places, their proof will be ""as already proven in this book."" Maybe they did this to make the book simple to read, but after reading the book BAD CALORIES AND GOOD CALORIES the book appears simplistic and hollow. They talk about all the diseases that are controlled by reducing carbohydrates and by extension insulin. But again, you have to take them at their word as no significant studies are detailed or analyzed."
3,charley,This book is a waste of time and money. It goes on and on about how a carb was made. LOL.Not really a lot of info about the diet until the last chapter. Bottom line it allows 72 carbs a day not like the Atkins 20 carbs witch is just too hard to follow. It allows you to have a few extra carbs a day so when you're feeling like you want to tear the wall down eat an extra apple.Anyway I've been on this diet 2 weeks. Lost 11 pounds. Already feeling/sleeping better. Don't want to take an afternoon nap.I`ll give the 3 stars because I love the fact I can have some extra carbs (up to 72) when I need them. It allows u to eat bread but not too go over the 72 carbs. If you ever go without bread for a few days you could be like me and find you don't like it as much anymore. Same with French fries.
1,Cites? We don't need no stinking cites...opinions are nice but facts are better,"Have been doing a lot of research into Paleo Diets and this book turned up. Based on the ratings I purchased the book. Sorry that I did. If you want a book with a lot of opinions, then this is the book for you. If you want a book that at least backs up some of the claims made, you know citing studies where you can see numbers, then this book is NOT for you. Matter of fact I got so irritated that I stopped reading the book near the end.Perhaps the web has me spoiled but these days if I read an article making claims that reference other ""studies"" I expect to see the link to that study. You don't none of that with this book. Just lots of opinions.Btw I am and have been a fan of Paleo Diets for quite some time...purchased this book hoping for some more ammunition to convince others."
1,Hype,I purchased this produce after watching Dr.Oz describe its health and weight loss benefits. I took the stuff daily as recommended and realized duhhh...nothing happening here.
2,no difference -for us-,"I have been using this product for about 6 weeks. I have not seen much of a change if any. I was very disapointed in the shipping time for this product. I think we may have been forgotten. It took three weeks to ship this product. When I inquired about the product, I received an e-mail that the order would ship that day. There was no explanation as to why it had not shipped. When I sent the e-mail, it had been two weeks since the order. It took an additional week to ship once I inquired. This item indicated that it was ""in Stock"" when ordered. The amount paid for shipping was not worth the 3 week wait. In addition, it came regular mail. The shipping price was 20% of the purchase price. I will not reorder again from this company. I would consider ordering or buying from a different company however."
4,Good book,"This is a good book overall, however, I would have liked to seen it broken out into more information per grade group, ie primary, etc. It is a good start and includes useful information."
2,Amateurish,This video does not seem very professionaly done. Looks as if someone was sitting in the audience with a camera. Grainey on HD TV. Audience shots do not fit in very well. Did not hold the interest of a 2 yr old Gabba fan.
4,Very fun!,"My 11 year old daughter states ""this is a very fun game. You can play as Wilbur and go through adventures and hide from the farmer. You also have to care for Wilbur by bathing him, brushing his teeth and etc. There are lots of mini-games to unlock that are also fun to play. This game would probably be great for 6 years old to about 13 years old."
