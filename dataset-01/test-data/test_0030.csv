1,review of company GEMWORKS!!!!!!,i still haven't recieved the product.i found out although i ordered it on 2/12----they DID NOT mail it until 2/26!!!!!!!!i am very VERY UNHAPPY with GEMWORKS COMPANY!!!!!!!i resolve never to do business w/ them again!!!!too bad they are connected w/ AMAZON.com because i have been pleased w/ amazon so far. i hope you let gemworks know about this as i was unable to get thru to them despite 4 e-mails!!!!!!!!!!thankyou-jan
1,Great for keeping water in; not for letting it out,"I have fiddled with these bottles every which way to try to get them to work for our small rodents; they simply don't allow the water to come out readily. I had to take out and shake the bottle each time the animals wanted a drink, which is not practical or healthy. Get pretty much any old generic bottle and it will be better for your pets than these."
4,It's alright.....,"When I first saw this book, I thought...is it going to be worth it to buy? well, i took the chance, and it was actually pretty good. At first the story gets my attention, but after a while, I started to dislike Vicky, her personality was very snobbish, spoiled and selfish. She took advantage of mens hearts for her own benefit, to match her desires. Because this is the first romance novel I have ever read, I forced myself not to give up. I would defidently not recommend this book, it is not very interesting, and the plot is boring."
4,Built cheap - Sounds great!,"Hello Musicfriends - This is built cheap but sounds great. Good controls too. For me in the studio/songwriting its perfect but I would not exactly go on tour with it..... There is something about the knobs I still love, even if all my other digital units have a tremolo hidden in it... may be the age thing..."
5,book for all sincere seekers,"What is logos, holy spirit, mind , thought?Mind is means of self expression,,, various frequency of vibration. Mind is everything ,,, but not god... so clear to me.It was very helpful to understand life, I am so happy that I read this book."
5,Discovering an Unexpected Treasure,"""Dreams..."" is the kind of subtly compelling music that continues to reward with repeated hearings. Its surfaces only hint at the mesmerizing treasures to be discovered within its depths -- much as the title suggests. Boyce's sensitivity to text, texture, timbre and meaning combine to create music full of drama and transcendence. From the same sound world as Benjamin Britten, Samuel Barber and George Crumb. Don't overlook this gem. Artfully paired with a rapturous performance of Vaughn Williams' ""The Lark Ascending."""
1,What can I say?,"Unit was offered at a good price and arrived promptly. Unfortunately,it was poorly packed and, as a result, was damaged in shipping. It appeared as if the face of the radio had been bouncing on the electrical prongs of the transformer. The left side polished metal panel had a couple dozen dings and the plastic screen cover had a 3/4"" scratch, 1/2"" of which was over the viewing part of the screen. It was not received in the immaculate shape it was described as. Following the directions provided by the Amazon website, I emailed the seller and asked for his return policy and have received no reply in over a month. What can I say?"
2,"Nightstand maybe, desktop definitely not","I live in the Northwest, where they say if you don't like the weather, wait 10 minutes. So even though the forecasts sometimes leave something to be desired, so do the forecasts of all the local weather professionals, so that aspect is about a toss-up.My complaint is, there's no way to keep the indigo blue backlight lit so I can read the info I bought it for. The front is highly reflective glass at a reclining angle, so it catches the ceiling light and everything on my desk between my seating position and the weather forecaster. What a pain in the butt!Nice product, but again, not for your desk, just for bedside or other places where you can reach over and punch the button if you need a nightlight."
2,Make Sure You Have Good FM Reception Before Buying,"I bought this $149 device with the expectation that I would receive decent signal from MSN Direct. Alas, it was only after I received the device and read the accompanying manual that I discovered the signal is via FM network. I cannot get a decent FM signal inside my house, and I doubt that I can get it at my office, where I intended to keep the Regional Weather Station. Yes, I've tried setting the device by an upper story window with clear access to the sky -- no go. I wish I knew a way of boosting the signal to the foot long wire sensor.Otherwise, the device would seem to be wonderful, as it bears all the various weather tracking features in an attractive package. The indiglo feature is especially nice for those intances when I might look up the summer night temperature to verify that its really as sweltering as it seems at 2:00am.But without that reception, this is just a wildly overpriced indoor thermo/hygrometer."
5,A Keeper,"Patty Griffin is one of the greatest singer-songwriters of the past decade and this cd is just as good as her others. Patty sings with honesty and raw emotion that is rarely, if ever, found in 'pop' music. If you enjoy heartfelt lyrics and acoustic guitar then you will enjoy this cd. 'Nobody's Crying' is one of my favorite songs of all time. 'Rain', 'Making Pies', 'Long Ride Home', 'Stolen Car', and 'Be Careful' are my favorites from this cd. ""Living With Ghosts"", and ""Flaming Red"", and ""Impossible Dream"" are other Patty cds worth checking out. I can only hope that Patty will have more music on the way."
5,Fabulous CD,"I am just now discovering Patty Griffin and I like EVERYTHING she has done. This is yet another great album. Her voice, her songwriting, and her varied presentations impress every time."
5,None better,"What can I say, WOW!! Great band, awesome singer, fantastic songs.Short but sweet review here, not a bad song to be found.The only problem with this cd is that it was Lance Kings last performance with BOP and he moved on to pastures new, after this album BOP were never the same. This one is without doubt their best, their finest moment and the smart band would have called it quits here and gone out on a high after losing such a talented vocalist.So if you want the best they have to offer this is the one you want, my recommendation is to get the japanese import as it features 2 bonus tracks which are just as good as the rest of the them and as I keep hearing, the jap imports have the best sound quality too."
1,blah,"Maybe it's because I didn't see the movie or maybe it's because I wanted something more like the Frida soundtrack but I found this CD to be very blah. I didn't care for the eternally slow version of Paloma. It also sounds like a soundtrack, which is fine if that's what you're into, but I prefer the songs and music to stand on their own and these just didn't do it for me."
4,Great Set......but.....defective...?????,I LOVE this set !! But.......I have had two copies of this Match Game DVD set....and find portions of the discs defective and unreadable on my DVD players...I have four different brands. Check out Disc Four....the 1962 Pilot.....anyone else having problems watching this...?
3,"Great concept package, but a lot of misses","I am SO GLAD this was finally released as it is one of the better early gameshows that had staying power. What a fantastic panel of celebrities and impromptu comedy. Get it just for the walk down memory lane.Now for the bad:1. Bad Disc 4!! I am in the process of returning my first set for this reason.2. Episodes should have been chronological and not all mixed up. You could really tell when the game started to pick up steam, but then you get thrown back to the 73-75 era which was just so-so.3. They could have picked better episodes, in my opinion. Some of the episodes could NOT have been the ""best"" of the Match Game. I remember screaming out loud in laughter at some of the episodes and they are not on this set.All in all, it's a great set. I'm not sure if they rushed this or what, but it could have been a masterpiece."
5,My Mother Loves Reliving This Golden Age of Games Shows!,My Mother still talks about this DVD! It is a way for her to remember a wonderful time in her life and the stars who made such a difference in these game shows.
4,Packaging could be better,"My husband and I are thrilled that the Match Game is outon DVD. However, the plastic inserts that are supposedto hold the four DVDs in place, broke during shipping.Luckily, we don't have any problems playing any of theDVDs as others have mentioned.Maybe there will be a Best of Match Game vol. 2 and someof these problems can be fixed."
4,A tad off the mark.....,"I finally ordered this for myself the other day. In general, I was pleased. The episodes selected are funny, but they're not the best I've seen. You'll get plenty of laughs when watching this, but I think they should release a second version with the BEST and FUNNIEST episodes."
1,"UPDATE: 4th copy works! (Can not watch the 4th disc, had 3 copies to try.)","Amazon finally gave up and refunded my money after three copies of disc 4 failed to play out the bonus material and shows 2, 4, 5 & 6.Hopefully this low-budget DVD company will fix the rpoblem and I will try to buy it in the future.****UPDATE**** The 4th copy I got from Amazon on 2/13/07 works! Maybe the problem has been corrected! ****It is interesting to first watch the 1962 Pilot, and then watch a 1973 episode. My how technology quickly advanced in those 11 years, considering that the second 33 year old Match Game 73 show looks like it could have been produced today.The extras are hit & miss, as they just show you clips from the shows you just watched in the DVD set. It is nice to see Bret doing an interview and telling first-hand stories of working on the show."
5,"""NON STOP DANCING""","I love this Mix !!!! All I can say is FINALLY!!!! a great Mixed CD that gets you pumping, I have to say, though, that it is far more than a dance CD, Can't get enough of it i play it all the timepeople should support the DJ's and no download the songs for free, i will support the DJ's all the time, thank you BADBOYJOE for a great mix !!"
5,BAD BOY JOE KEEPS ROCKIN !,"A must have for your C.D. Dance Collection. Awesome song selection, Excellent Mixes ! Anything from Bad Boy Joe is HOT! Don't sleep on anything he releases, just buy it and enjoy it. For those of you who enjoy Freestyle music don't forget to pick up BAD BOY JOE'S BEST OF FREESTYLE MEGAMIX VOLUMES 1-5."
1,never again,"I can't believe you people gave this movie 4 stars?? i think i actually fell asleep during this movie about twice, what a horrible movie! you see a flying hand in the movie like twice and that's about it. horror fans want to see horror not some boring movies with no plot! doesn't even deserve half a star at that!"
3,Alphabet Puzzle,"We puchased this puzzle for our daughter's third birthday. She already knows most of her letters and which words begin with what letters, so we thought this puzzle would be good practice. The pictures under the letters were not always chosen well. For example, A is an airplane with jet engines and J is a jet plane. L is a picture of bugs - one of which is a ladybug and W is a horse and wagon. She actually has to know the letter to best decide what the picture represents. A good product, but not the best it could have been."
3,ABC Puzzle a Disappointment.,"This puzzle was the only disappointment. It is not as strong as the other puzzles, must have been made by a different manufacturer."
1,A Fake Melissa and Doug Product?,"I almost always thoroughly read reviews before purchasing a product, but this time I didn't, and I certainly paid for it. I am pretty sure this isn't a real Melissa and Doug product. First, the name of the product looks to be handwritten on the board. Second, the letters are thin, and not the usual thickness that most M&D puzzles are. The pictures behind the letters are rather odd, and not very bright or attractive. The entire puzzle just appears to be really cheaply made, and I'm sure it's only a matter of time before the letters become damaged."
3,Not as advertised!,It took almost 5 weeks for our product to arrive and it does not have those fashionable beadboard sides as advertised - the whole reason we bought this instead of another less expensive product. Ripoff!
4,"Quality performance, but CD too short","Briefly - the performances are great. Entertaining, nice arrangements, spot on performances. Everything the other reviewer mentioned is accurate.However, quite dissapointingly, the CD is under 45 minutes in length, clocking in exactly at 44 minutes, 51 seconds. Yet, the CD is full price. With 80 minute CDs, and a typical CD of decent value running on average 60 minutes, getting a 45 minute CD is unfortunate.A nice CD to listen to, interesting to own, but it's excellent quality is diminished by it's short length, making it less valuable for the money."
4,"Great performance, lousy remastering","I had the cassette version of this recording and tried to copy it onto CD. The cassette jammed so often that I gave up and ordered a used copy of the ""professionally"" made CD. Having listened to the cassette repeated while trying to copy it, I can tell you unequivocally that the cassette sounded light years ahead of the CD -- bright and spacious, while the sound on the CD was just there. If I can (when the cassette deigns to turn) transfer this recording to CD with great sound, why can't EMI? As to the performance, Battle is at her best, often breath-taking. Her mannerisms are out in force, but they work wonderfully with the material."
5,you should get this,"The Doers are an acoustic ""punk"" band from Vancouver, B.C. Canada, and are, in the humble opinion of this critic, possibly one of the coolest bands around, both live and on cd. If you liked the first Violent Femmes album, but somehow felt that they went in the wrong direction thereafter, then the Doers just may be what you are looking for. They are fun, ironic, incisive, witty, and occasionally brash and brazen, enough to make them simultaneously utterly approachable but with an edge. They are what some might call an art school band, whose songs are smart and witty without the overly serious pretentiousness that befalls so many indie bands these days. Like all good art, you'll be edified without even realizing it while you're singing along."
5,Greatest tenor I've ever heard,"I think Corelli was the handsomest and most beautiful tenor voice of all time. Period. Next to him, even Gigli and Caruso pales. The best high notes of all time."
3,Barbie And The Three Musketeers,"My ten-year-old daughter wrote this:After seeing this movie, Barbie and the Three Musketeers, I began to have second thoughts about it. It was an okay movie, but here are some pro's and con's.Pros:1. The music was trendier than other movies.2. The bond between the four girls was quite believable.3. Kelly Sheridan was the main role in the movie, and lately, she hasn't, so this was definitely a perk.4. The movie had some serious girl power!5. The kitten was adorable, and I think it's cute how she wanted to be a ""Musk-cat-eer.""Cons:1. I enjoy the more ""princess-y"" movies, and this one, in our opinion, had too much fighting.2. It didn't exactly have that ""Barbie Charm"" to it, and it's a bit too hard to explain what it is.3. It just really didn't make me feel good after viewing it.So overall, I didn't really like the movie, but maybe it just wasn't my taste."
5,goin insane,this album IS totally insane-bangin all the way through-true fire from these og e.p.a. gangstas... features DRE-DOG on the opening cut that's just way too ill- go insane to this 1
3,Not Terible,The helmet is extremely cheaply made. It did not last an hour of trick or treat.It is a one and done.
2,too small,Costume is much to small to wear clothing under to be warm and I got a size bigger than my son wears!
3,Spill Proof,"Cute and colorful. The Backyardigan pictures did fade off after so many washes, but cups are sturdy and spill proof."
2,Talking into a can,"If you like to sound like your talking into a can, this is the phone for you. Everything else works great except for the sound quality outbound. Nice look, nice features, poor microphone."
1,Total Ripoff!!,"I agree with mcrazi8 from Washington's review. I received a call on behalf of my long distance carrier promoting the model 242 2.4 ghz cordless phone. It was hard getting used to my own voice blasting in my ear as I talked as well as the discomfort of the hot battery which ran down very quickly. After about 2 months, my display looked like the dislpay on a calculator that had malfunctioned, with unreadable, and mutated number symbols which finally disappeared all-together. Now it will not hold a charge and I have the same problems attempting to find a replacement battery. 200+ $ later, I'm a very angry customer."
3,nice simple phone...but,"The LCD or key pad does not have a light. Really inconvenient for low light use. Sound is OK, both sending and receiving."
1,My advice: Don't buy this overpriced telephone!,"The battery doesn't hold a charge for more than about a day to a day and a half, and this is with little use. The caller ID feature often just reports ""Incoming Call"" and no other info about caller, even though it is a number that shows up at other times. If you like hands free operation, don't expect it with this phone. If you think the high frequency means better reception, it doesn't. My cheekbone often hits the talk button and disconnects me. The bottom line... I HATE THIS TELEPHONE AND I WISH I HAD SENT IT BACK!!!"
1,Classic Ignorance,This book does contain some practical information for travel in Afghanistan but it is difficult to be patient enough to wade through the [fluff] in order to get to the useful material. The commentaries on Afghan culture are negative and condescending. Unfortunately there is not much else available on the topic.
2,not worth it,"I just didn't like it, for a variety of reasons, including those metnioned by the other reviewer. Weber should stick to teaching."
3,"Nice video, annoying DVD setup","With a nod to the reviewer below who mentions Angelina's whininess (I find the little prima ballerina to be something of a drama queen), I still think these are fairly sweet and harmless stories. What drives me nuts about this DVD is that there is no way to jump to the main menu or to individual stories. You either have to play the whole thing all the way through, or fast forward till you get to the segment you want. For me, the great convenience of DVD's is being able to hop around more quickly than with videotapes. I don't know what the producers were thinking when they made this DVD, but it's an annoying feature."
3,wrong author,the front page author does not match the listed author.This needs to be corrected soon.
3,Skip the middle and enjoy,"Starts off strong and is very imaginative, but devolves into predictable repetition as the second/third/fourth/fifth daughter finds her Love via machine. The last daughter's refusal to participate is a nice end cap to the novel. Charming overall!"
4,Good stuff,"This CD grows on you; it's bloody good stuff. It could almost be another Wilburys album to complete the set. What it is really is a swansong, an album of it. One of his best, no doubt about it. No collector of George's or ex-Beatles stuff can pass on this one; it's that good.A really fresh breeze of music, especially when considered against all the crap they put out now."
2,"Disappointing, except for one song","George Harrison absolutely LOVED ukulele/Hawaiian music in the last years of his life. It is a shame that he didn't do an entire album of covers as he has the exuberant, buoyant spirit of that genre down perfectly in his cover here of ""Devil and the deep blue sea"". It is the one irresistably charming element in an otherwise hum-drum set. Most of this album is uninspired and lacks melodic hooks to draw you in. Songs begin, progress, and then end with hardly anything musically noteworthy occurring. Some seem as if they were slapped together quickly and beg for reworking. Yes, I know that George was very ill when he made this. An album should not be given high ratings merely because it is a memento of a dying legend, though."
5,Crisp and Clear,"The sound is excellent, the words are poetic and mystical, the music is uplifting and soaring, George at his best."
3,"Brainwashed, indeed.","Boy, the other reviewers have been very kind to George. As a follow up to 1987's exceptional set ""Cloud 9"", ""Brainwashed"" struck me as weak. I'm always suspicious when a posthumous recording is released long after the artist has died. ""Brainwashed"" is no exception. The music here is unmemorable. You can't really distinguish one acoustic guitar driven song from the others. The obvious standout track both musically, melocically and lyrically is ""Any Road"". This song is the perfect bookend on George's life and philosophical views. It's optimistic and reflective, with its views firmly placed on 'wherever you go, there you are'. I was hoping for a stellar closing set to George's career, but this was a big letdown. This, and Paul McCartney's latest ""Driving Rain"" have a very lackluster feel to them. It's a major loss to have George gone, and I believe that were he still alive right now ""Brainwashed"" would sound different--in a better way."
4,Classic Harrison,"This is a very good CD--classic Harrison. It is spiritual, playful and thoughtful. It's sad to realize that I will never again experience listening to a new George Harrison CD, but reassuring to know that his wonderful music will live on forever."
5,A perfect album,"Some will say that All Things Must Pass is George's masterpeice, but it's because they don't know this album. This is not only my favorite Harrison, it's also one of my top ten album of all time. It's a wonderful album full of melodic and artful songs, subtle arrengments and soul from the start to the end, the highest point being Stuck Inside A Cloud. Any Road, another standout, has some of the most cool and inspired lyrics I know. Every other songs have their charms, you just have to buy the album to find it. Just put this cd in your discman, take a bus ride in a sunny day and look at the blue sky, look at the clouds, you'll probably see George smiling at you."
5,George's Transcendent Farewell,"""Brainwashed"" is classic George Harrison that contains some of his strongest, most incisive work. There are no weak spots on this posthumous album, with ""Rising Sun"" and ""Stuck Inside a Cloud"" standing proudly among Harrison's finest songs. The additional production by Jeff Lynne and Dhani Harrison complements George's transcendent musical vision. Clocking in at 46 minutes, ""Brainwashed"" represents a graceful coda to Harrison's career."
5,Last effort,"What sort of album would you expect from an all-time great recording artist who knew that this was going to be his last album?This is that album. If you like George Harrison, then you owe it to yourself to listen to this. ""Brainwashed"" is George Harrison in his final essence, when he knew that he would only get one last chance."
3,"More Variety Than Their Debut, But...","While this album scores points for having a little more variety than their first album, it isn't so great knowing how it was released. The Monkees weren't even informed of its initial release. Don Kirshner, the big cheese, had just released it. The first they heard of it was when they found a copy at a record shop while on tour. They had no say in what songs went in or not. (There were a lot of outtakes recorded the same time.) Needless to say, they were outraged. Don Kirshner was soon dumped as music manager and better music was to come.Back to the album. It has it's strong points. the strong single ""I'm A Believer""/""Stepping Stone,"" early punk nugget ""She,"" and the nutty ""Your Auntie Grizelda"" stand out. But all of Davy's songs (except ""Look Out"") are inferior, especially ""The Day We Fall In Love."" And Nez didn't even play on ""Mary Mary,"" which he wrote. The Monkees were slowly growing, but it would develop on the next two albums."
5,Memories,This is one of my favorite Monkees album. I have this one and about wore it out. Davy was the favorite of mine and glad I got to see him in concert.
4,long live LPs,"Glad I was able to purchase this one (after 40 years)...so many lost favorites that never make it to the ""best of"". Still like their first album the best, but this is an essential album for a Monkee lovers collection."
2,2 stars for 2 songs,"Necessary for Meshuggah fans but hardly worth the price, Rare Trax is a disparate collection of unreleased and (really) old Meshuggah songs that, in some cases, should not have been removed from the studio vaults. There are, however, two marginally good Meshuggah songs back to back on the disc (I'll let you figure out which songs I mean), and combined with the sheer curiosity of some of the other tracks, they make this album worth owning if Meshuggah is one of your favorite bands--and they are one of my favorite bands, hence my owning the disc. But to a casual listener: beware! Stick to Destroy Erase Improve."
2,item in the picture is not what we received,"We ordered the Uniden two way radio. The picture shows two radios with the charging base. When we recieved the package we received just the radios, no charging base or rechargeable batteries. We had to do some adjustments to be able to use the radios in the way that we had needed."
4,The Spice route,"I already owned the book and wanted it for a gift - I'm interested in the history of the area as well as the food, and it met expectations. The recipes I've tried, using the processes they recommend, are wonderful. If you like exotic foods, and want to know how they came about, you'll love this book. There's a paperback, but I think it's a sequel, not the same book."
3,angus kennedy,"While very challenging and insightful, I found many of the stories to be superficially ""cute"" and a little self-indulgent. Not as satisfying as I thought it would be."
4,Tasty,"What a great way to teach science. Children learn best when they can relate to what they are learning and they can relate to most food. Tell them, they forget; show them they remember; but once they've made it and eaten it they will understand(paraphrase of a chinese proverb). I consider this a significant book in our collection for teachers and future teachers."
3,Not for kids,It's a good book but not for kids. Be prepared to teach rather than create. I enjoy the book but it's too much work to explain to the kids why things are happening. A good book for teachers as it could be combined with a lesson.
1,Virtually gone![.],"THis is the album where MAiden reached the bottom... Some drastic measures were needed...Fire Blaze Bayley as scapegoat to the fact that the songs in VIrtual XI are simply bad songs... Hire Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith to return to the good old times... Smart guys....VIRTUAL XI is something very sad. WHy? Because, with all the fall they had in the nineties, Maiden at least never sold out to commercial music. They are already getting openly into the compilation market (their new compilation release, EDWARD THE GREATEST, is simply a greedy manouver. They hadalready released a master compilation,BEST OF THE BEAST, and ""dozens"" of live albums[.]!), but their music is Steve Harris's music, strong and powerful.In VIRTUAL XI, the production is weak (as ever, since Martin Birch stopped producing Maiden albums, and some of the songs had potential. But they suffer from a new awful characteristic in Maiden songs: an awful repetition of the choruses of the songs[.] It's endless![.]"
1,Why?WHYYYYYYYYYYYY?,"I hate to say bad things about Iron Maiden...I love this band and forever will thank God for their existence...but Virtual Xi is a shame...Ok, Futureal and Clansman are ok...But what about the rest of the album...I don't care about the fact that Blaze Bailey is the singer, but the musics are REALLY REALLY uninspired! I can't believe Steve Harris thought that como estais amigos, educated fool,Don't look to the eyes and the lame angel and the gambler are good songs...THIS IS THE WORST MAIDEN ALBUM, but if you are really a fanatic you may like this REALLY REALLY uninspired moment by MAIDEN!"
2,Really weak,"If the songs were at least more well produced or played with more energy, they could at least disguise a little the lack of quality on them.SO, after VIrtual XI, farewell to Blaze Bayley, who went on to record two great albums, SILICON MESSIAH and THE TENTH DIMENSION."
1,Why?,"I'm sorry. I love Iron Maiden like the next metalhead, but this album blows. Blaze Bayley IS a good singer, but he just doesn't suite the band. However, I can't say it's TOTAL crap, I liked some songs...1. Futureal - 5/5 The best song on the album. The riff is great, and so are the solos.4. The Clansman - 5/5 At almost ten minutes long, the longest song on the album. I prefer ""Sign of the Cross"" to this, but it's not a bad song at all.There you go. Only two good songs. ONLY and I mean _ONLY_ buy this album if you are...- A completist, like me.- A die-hard IM fan that must have EVERYTHING!Oh well, at least it's better than St. Anger..."
3,Sounds more like the who... Not a bad thing,I have read all the bad reviews of this and i quite like it.No Bruce but still fun. Good show boys
5,Virtual xi,The Second album with blaze bailey that joined iron maiden for a while.Its a great album!
5,More interesting Details,"Andy Kilpatrick tells the story of Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway with exacting detail. To those of us who love the subject we will certainly enjoy this book. New details in Buffett's life and the story of Berkshire Hathaway can be found here for even the most avid researcher of this man and his company. If you do not know of Buffett start with Mr. Kilpatrick's book and you will be richer after reading ""Of Permanent Value""."
4,"Good Plot, but Disappointing Ending.","I always look forward to a new novel by John Grisham, having read all of his previous published works. Although his last four novels did not exhibit quite the intrigue, character development, and spell-binding plots, typical of his earlier works, they were interesting nevertheless.For some reason, however, I was expecting more from THE KING OF TORTS, and hoped that it would capture some of the qualities of THE FIRM, THE CLIENT, et al. In keeping with Grisham's trend of declining creativity, though, THE KING OF TORTS was enjoyable, but not outstanding. The ending was particularly disappointing, as Clay's (the main character) avarice had been self-condemned and, as such, should not have cost him EVERYTHING."
2,Not one for the time capsule.,"On the positive side, this was a compelling read - suspenseful, with interesting characters and decent plot development. Sadly, it ultimately disappoints. The main character's journey into greed and arrogance would seem to lead the reader toward something either meaningful, catastrophic, or in-your-face-greed-is-good cynical. Maybe it tries to do all three, but sadly, it succeeds at none. The almost inadvertant climax leads into an unsatisfying, incomplete, unresolved, weak ending with the reader (or at least this reader) feeling, ""So, what was the point of this again?"" Grisham seems to have been drifting toward this type of unresolved ending, with no clear resolution. ""The Summons"" ended with a similar lack of resolution, but worked better.With ""King"", Grisham just left me wanting. Not more, but something else."
1,Grisham at his worst,"John Grisham past the peak of his writing with the Rainmaker and now continues to publisher a book every March, whether he has written anything worthwhile or not. He has the potential to write great popular fiction, but quite obviously didn't devote much time to character or story line development in this sad effort. Perhaps Mr Grisham should disregard any contractural agreements and leave the story writing until he feels creative. How much longer can his novels wear the title ""bestseller"" merely based on his old reputation as a great fiction writer."
3,Grisham shows his weaknesses,"No one confuses John Grisham with Ernest Hemmingway, but he has show a talent for creating well crafted stories in the past. And he continues to do so here, weaving the story of the rise of one lawyer who essentially sells his soul to become the titular king of torts. If you know Grisham, you know what to expect - quick action, simple writing, legalese and a quick resolution. The problem here is that he tries to build up some characters but never delivers on them. Most prominently is the character of the model Ridley, who he gives dubious motives and hints that there is more than meets the eye, but then just drops her out of the story when convenient. A lot of wasted efforts to produce such a throwaway character. Essentially this book, like the others, are perfect airport reads - pick it up, enjoy it for what it is and let it while away the time while you wait."
2,Boring,"There is no one to empathize with and it reads like a series of events that someone is listing, as opposed to an intriguing plot with characters and interesting happenings. I was very disappointed."
2,Another Sprint to the End,"Here we go again, or there we went > WHOOSH! Another sprint-to-the-end novel, a character with ""Clay"" feet, a boring bimbo, friends who are too good for him. I'm glad I got it from the library. In the last few years, authors who have given me years of enjoyment have apparently tired of their craft, and I wonder why they keep writing. Can it still be the money? Still? With The Summons I thought Grisham was ""back,"" or at least heading in that direction, but guess not. I feel like a fair-weather fan, but I think I'm entitled."
3,King of Chutzpah,"A gruff San Francisco maverick named Melvin Belli was the original King of Torts. Belli made a fortune trying exploding bottle and aircraft crash cases. He was thrown out of the American Bar Association which he likened to being ""kicked out of the Book Of The Month Club.""J. Clay Carter, Grisham's anti-hero, lacks the litigation skills and court house artistry of the real king but none of the chutzpah. A public defender he does not hesitate to sell out a murder defendant to start of career in what is called ""mass torts."" The money, the jets, the women, the wine is all there as this thirtysomething kid trades on greed and gullibility to gain incredible riches.I am tiring of Grisham's characters who, in the real world, would be quickly disbarred. This would be a fate a heck of a lot worse than being ""kicked out of the Book Of The Month Club."""
1,good job,helped me on my economics report. great artical i'll give it a 4 becuase i acually had to do the report
4,Good read,This was an enjoyable book. I liked the humor. My favorite scene was the wedding reception. It's not really a thriller; it's a morality play about selling your soul. What I like most about Grisham is that he can write (something a lot of bestselling authors don't seem to know how to do). It's amazing how he can make a topic like torts sound facinating.
1,Terrible,"By the time you get to the middle of the book your wondering what is the whole point. I eagerly kept reading waiting for it to get better and it never did. ""I want my money back"""
4,Finally - a good ending!,"My biggest beef with Grisham's books is that the ending is worthy of a mistrial. He has acquitted himself well with ""The King of Torts"". Clay's character doesn't seem the type to do what he did - is this moral ambiguity or an incomplete character?"
3,This is Grisham?,"This is the first Grisham book I have read. It started slow. Around page 80 the story got interesting and remained that way to the end, although nothing was gripping. As a lawyer, I liked the basic story line. However, if this book is typical of Grisham's writing, then in my view his success is in his ability to spin an good story line, not in his actual fiction ""writing"" ability, which seems to be quite mediocre."
2,Not Impressed,"I've read many Grisham novels and this is by far the poorest entry. It was so predictable and flat that if it had been any other author I would have put it down before finishing. If this had been a first novel, I would never read another. This may have been my last Grisham."
1,King of Disappointment!,"I had great hopes through the first 2/3 of the book - but couldn't believe or excuse the wrap! I love to read, so it's not often that I want to send a book back and ask for a complete refund but the King of Torts isn't even worth the paperback price let alone the hardcover I purchased.John Grisham abandoned the book mid-way through.The King of Torts is a King of Disappointments. This book is one I would never recommend."
2,Alright.. not great,"I read this one when it came out, and in comparison to Grishams others this one falls behind. It was an entertaining read, but to me, it was an ""in betweener"", something to fill up a couple of days before got into his juicier novels (eg, The Rainmaker - of which I highly recommend ).Cheers"
3,"Predictable, romantic","Good one, expected more. Predictable,I knew the ending from the 6th chapter. Liked it because it was full of suspense and the ending was kind of romantic. I'm now heading for the The Chamber..."
2,"Love Grisham, Very Disappointed","Like most, I've read them all. Very disappointed. 1) No ""clever"" legal twists; 2) A very weak romance that the reader was not cheering for; 3) Kept waiting for ""something"" to happen ... it never did.I'll buy his next book on the first day and hope for more.Respectfully, Capt. Dave"
4,Tale of Greed,I enjoyed this book very much. I think all of us can learn a lesson about how greed can change us from this book. I do agree however with other reviewers when they say that Max Pace's character did not find closure. I wondered what happened to him and also to the model girlfriend. I loved the fast pace of the book and look forward to the next novel.
2,Long and drawn out,"I have liked Grisham's stuff depsite the archetypal characters and sometimes hackneyed storylines... that's part of the allure for me of reading Grisham. I was expecting a mystery or a thriller, etc but this book just dragged on and on... It was a boring lesson in morality and an attempt to document the decline of a tort lawyer. I kept expecting a mystery but instead got a boring tale of excess, greed, and torts."
1,What a let down,"With the exception of a look into the greed which propels the mass tort litigation system in American jurisprudence, this book offered little for the serious legal thriller fan like myself. It lacked suspense and excitement and contained far too many boring characters. Not even the protagonist, Clay Carter presented as a strong and fully developed character. I was hopeful that this book would mark a return to vintage Grisham as exhibited by the plot and characterisation in The Firm and The Client, for example.Once again I felt short-changed when I was finished reading this novel as I have with the last several Grisham legal thrillers."
3,A Modern Morality Tale,"It's always hard to read a book that has a lead character with few redeeming qualities, and the King of Torts is no exception. While the story is fascinating in its details about tort law, class action suits, and class action lawyers, who come out rather like comic book characters, it is not particularly gripping, as Clay Carter's roller coaster ride is completely predictable right to the end. This is a modern morality tale about money, greed, and power, and a very average one at that. Don't skip reading it, but don't expect a lot either."
4,The King is Back,"Lately, John Grisham's books have been pretty bad. Skipping Christmas, A Painted House, The Brethren and The Summons were very forgettable. The King of Torts is different. It is a rags to riches story in which you can't help cheering for the protagonist, Clay Carter. As the novel begins Clay is stuck in a dead-end job as a public defender. In a hard to believe plot leap, Clay is contacted by a ""fireman,""(a person hired by big corporations implicated in lawsuits to get a settlement) Max Pace who gives him the opportunity to make millions of dollars. Clay gleefully accepts this opportunity and is soon a hotshot multimillionaire with a private jet, house on St. Barts, Porsche and bimbo girlfriend. But of course, this couldn't last... The King of Torts seems to me as an illustration of the contempt in which Grisham holds the profession of mass tort lawyers. It's a quick, great read that will be sure to please fans of Grisham's and also those just looking for a thrilling read."
2,Same old same old,"I am a long time fan of Grisham. I have read all of his law-based books. I have noticed a downward slide in his recent work. The earlier works have good plot twists and sometimes a surprise ending. Lately, the books have tended to end a little ambigiously or downright dull. This book is no exception. Good idea, neat plot line, but the character development is lacking. Some characters are developed and then set aside. When I finished this book last night, having stayed up late to do so, I was left with a strong sense of disappointment. Grisham fans beware. Not sure if I'd recommend this to anyone. Sorry."
2,Misleading!!,"I picked up this book based on the back cover, which describes the book as the tale of one drug gone bad and some vigilante lawyer justice. However, that storyline is quickly dropped in favour of a get rich scheme. The lawyer is picked up and turned into a money making machine, outfitted with a convincing office and staff. But then they set to work on some compeltely unrelated case and it all comes crashing down with the espionage and the illegal and blah blah blah.I know this is the way of John Grisham novels, but the back cover is so off in tone one really wonders if the same book is being described. In any case, the book is pretty boring and lackluster."
4,It's About Time,"Mass tort lawyers are the men who win billion-dollar class-action settlements from corporations selling bad products, then rake fantastic fees off the top, with far smaller payouts going to the people harmed by the products. Clay Carter is a burning-out lawyer at the Office of the Public Defender (OPD) in Washington, D.C., when he catches the case of a teen who, for no apparent reason, has gunned down an acquaintance. Clay is approached by a mysterious stranger, who says he represents a megacorporation whose bad drug caused the teen--and others--to kill. Thus begins the life of a tort lawyer. It's been a while since I have read a ""great"" Grisham, but this one was pretty good."
1,What's the point -- this book is a waste of time,I read through this whole book waiting for it to get good... it never did! I thought there was going to be some twist that made all of the foolishness worthwhile -- there wasn't! Obviously this was a cheap grab by the publisher and author to cash in before the Grisham franchise goes away completely. Bah!
2,Big Disappointment for a Big Grisham Fan!,"I was so excited to see Grisham was back in the legal forum with his latest book, but this was rather disappointing. I finally gave up hope when 90% of the book was read that there was no twist, no exciting turn of events, no scandal. Just a predictable ""day in the life"" story of a fast rising tort lawyer.Grisham still writes in a fast paced witty way & always manages to spin the perfect compelling character. That was the only saving grace.Bottom Line: Don't expect too much and you might not be disappointed. This is NOT ""The Firm""."
2,Not worthy of Grisham,"This is not one of Grisham's better works. He tends to write well and so it is worth reading; but, it is sooooo predictible."
2,Grisham can do better.,"I have read all of John Grisham's novels so picking up this one was natural for me. I wish I hadn't.The story really never goes anywhere. Clay, A poor lawyer, gets rich, and then it appears that he is getting in trouble with the FBI, but that goes nowhere. Then he loses all of his money. That is pretty much the entire story line. Sprinkeled into this is Clay's desire to rekindle his old relationship with his now ex Rebecca and his hatred for her parents. She shows up about 30 pages from the end of the book and they are back together. This does nothing to add to the plot.I found myself hoping that Clay would get tied up in a court battle for his insider trading which would have set up a good courtroom drama for Grisham to write to.I don't know if Grisham has lost it, or his editors tore his original apart and ended up with this sorry novel. Regardless, I will hesitate with Grisham's next effort appears on the bookstore shelf."
4,SOLID GRISHAM,"I always look forward to John Grisham's new novels. Sometimes I'm disappointed, sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed this book. Reading Grisham you try to figure out how it's going to go at the end. I'm still getting over the last page of THE PARTNER. I enjoyed this book and I liked the ending. I breezed through this novel in two days. That's how into it I was. Not his best work, but solid work."
2,Crime does Pay,"What a lousy book with lousy, amoral characters that you dont care about at all. It was a fast read and engaged you but disapointing in the end. You would think that the character would learn from his evil ways but in the end what does he learn? Nothing. Therefore, whats the point?"
1,Time to inject new ingredients into a tired formula,"Grisham has wasted his and our time with this one. Why spend the time reading about a pathetic under-achiever who is given the golden goose. I didn't care about him from the start and it never got better. The characters are boring and, the plot line predictable and very tired. I didn't even finish the book. Don't start it!"
2,Typical Grisham,"The book is typical Grisham and an easy read...It appears that Mr. Grisham has abandoned his roots as the Plaintiff's attorney for the ""average Joe"" in small southern town, ""Oxford, Miss,"" and that he is now more comfortable being in bed with big business and the insurance industry. The book pure fiction."
1,Disappointing,"From the previews, I was expecting something along the lines of ""The Rainmaker"". Little man fighting a huge corporation. It turned out differently. The plot is pretty simple, the main character starts out with an almost minimum wage salary, makes millions, then loses it. Everything else is just filler. THis book had the potential for a WHOLE lot more."
1,Don't even wait for the video,"I have read all Grisham's book's and this is by far the worst. What a let-down. Unlike his other legal thrillers there is no character to root for, unless you pick Tequila Watson! Whom I hoped Clay Carter would go back and try to rescue somehow. If any author could have swung a 'save' for Tequila I thought Grisham would have been the man. Sorry I wasted my money."
2,Formulaic Disapointment,"It's too good to be true. The King of Torts is being set up from the beginning. He has an escapist ride to the top of the heap, but crashes and burns one set of values and has another set ready for the inevitable end. Too much like ""The Firm."" To Grisham's credit it is quickly paced so you can finish this dog and find something with more substance."
4,Pretty good.,"I am an avid reader of Grisham and a collector of his legal thrillers. This book is overall a good read, compared to my experience with The Bretheren (still trying to get through it).Although The King of Torts is good, it in now way lives up to Grisham's earlier works. This book is engaging but I didn't feel it had the pull that his earlier books did.I enjoyed it a great deal and I am hanging tight for the next legal Grisham book!"
3,Typical Grisham,"King of Torts is a typical Grisham novel. It follows the same pattern as his other lawyer stories. However, I can say that I was suprised that it took the main character as long as it did to spend the money and then lose it. The pattern was predictable from the beginning. I'm sorry to say that this was not one of Grisham's best."
5,Better Than I Remember,"I was lucky to recieve an advance copy of this DVD/Blue Ray combo pack and I am glad I did because I don't know if I could have waited. I loved the movie as I child and I was excited to share it with my daughter. She is 3 and liked it (but we had to skip some of the scarier patrs, but she did not seem to notice. I also love the fact that it comes in a dvd/blue ray combo pack. I have been reluctant to buy dvd's lately because we will be getting a blue ray player shortly, so it seems like a waste, this allowed me to get a blue ray and also have the dvd to watch now. The quality on the dvd was great and we had a chance to watch the blue ray on a friends player and that was even more amazing."
5,Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs Diamond Edition,"I love Walt Disney and love all of the ""Classic"" Disney movies. This Diamond Edition on Blu-Ray and DVD lives up to the expectations that people view Disney movies. I was very excited to receive this edition as were my two sons who also share the love of Disney movies as I do. The quality of animation in the Blu-Ray movie is spectacular. The sound quality is so excellent it was like sitting in the theater while watching in the comforts of home.This edition is loaded with many, many extras that are fun for the whole family, such as games, behind the scenes, karoke and more. My family has spent hours exploring all that the Blu-ray edition has to offer.This is a MUST for everyone whether you have children or not."
1,Damaged dvd,This video must have been copied as the video display keeps popping up. The beginning is garbled and the ending stops short. I was sorely disappointed and will NEVER buy a video from here again.
5,perfect for disney fan,"disney movies are desired by anyone with children, especially girls, the problem is they are very difficult to find. i looked in all the major stores for dvds to purchase and asked around, and was always told the same thing, they only come out during certain times, they arent produced anymore etc. so i got the next best thing, vhs. Vhs movies are easy to find online and considerably cheaper than purchasing a dvd. most are used, but in very excellent condition depending upon which seller you choose. i have purchased about 10 disney vhs movies through amazon.com, and am pleased with all. the only thing that is sort of ironic is usually the shipping costs more than the product itself!:P"
2,Snow White,"I have not ordered this item. I will not order this item. I almost did, until I took a second look at the price. This item is so overpriced, that it will not become a part of my Disney collection. I can't believe Disney would charge this much for a Blu-ray disc. I give the movie 5 stars, but the packaging and cost bring it down to a 2. Sorry Disney."
4,Snow Wite,"Thos Product came sealed and new. It also arrived early, but I seen it had a small crack in the box even though it was sealed."
3,"Cute, classic movie. 3.75 stars.","This movie has a lot of charm, but sometimes it's a little boring.Snow White is cute and all. And she has an alright personality. But I feel this movie lacks some of the perfection that other titles such asPeter Pan (2-Disc Platinum Edition),The Lion King (Disney Special Platinum Edition)andThe Little Mermaid (Two-Disc Platinum Edition)had.The animals add a lot to the overall innocent feel to the movie. And like I said, Snow White has the perfect, girl-next-door personality.I'm sure I was watching the restored version, but from what I did see, the movie has aged really well considering it was from 1937. That was 72+ years ago!I really enjoyed watching them all dance with Snow White. It was cute.All in all, a good movie for kids and some adults to enjoy. Grumpy's comments and Dopey's actions were the funniest.3.75 stars or a 7.5/10."
5,Still great after all these years,"There is nothing like watching the Disney classic Snow White. I didn't think my grandchildren, both boys, would like it because of the love story, but they both sat with me and watched the only movie. They didn't like the voice of Snow White, felt it too high pitched, but for the most part, they liked the movie."
5,Thanks,"Fast Shipment, Product as promised brand new and sealed. Would buy again from this seller and recommend to others."
4,It's Snow White. You must love it!,"This movie is a classic! So fantastic! I had problems getting the second disc--the features--to work, but it may be my DVD player. It looks great!"
5,high quality,i grew up with this movie so it was only natural that I would want my kids to enjoy it as well. I love the price I payed when everyone else was charging 30.00 I was able to find this gem for less than 15.00. The video quality is great and as anything should last for years to come if treated right.
5,staying young,"Watching the movies of my childhood beats most of the movies I see today. Snow White was one that lasts forever in my memory as one that I can watch over and over again, and I'm sure not afraid to let the young ones watch them either as the content is wholesome."
4,Everything seams in order.,"The set would seam to be in order, however, it seams to me that most of my store bought platinum editions had variouse stickers on the outside film covering and that there was usually great heaps of bonus offer literature inside. The box, cover, and dvd's themselves are of good quality and if this is a forgery then it is of the highest quality. I somehow doubt any of my other Disney DVDs will notice the differance. I'm sold."
5,Never gets old!!!,"Snow white and the seven dwarfs is a timeless master piece that will never get old! It was an honor to be able to own the DVD to be able to play it with some modern equipment (i.e. Blu-ray player). The romance, the comedy, the drama just keeps you begging for more! I hope that disney continues to bring back the movies that were on VHS to blu-Ray and DVD!"
2,Need a translator,"I did not know that this product would be a Korean rip off. And I did not think it would be a big deal until I attempted to change the language in the settings, unless you know Korean because the settings are all in Korean also. The savings are not worth the hassle."
2,Never received my movie,I purchased this movie on January and its the 2nd to last week of February and I haven't received this movie. I am wondering if it got lost in the mail or they never shipped it. I was charged right away but haven't received the product.
4,Even a jaded Disney viewer should like Snow White,"I am often sickened by Disney's overpriced cheesy books, toys and other merchandise that are far from ""classic"" as well as their idiotic marketing ploy for their videos - the Disney vault. Yet when I watch a wonderful classic film like this all is forgiven. One caution the movie could be frightening to very young or fearful children. The Queen and her mirror are really scary as are her various plots to kill Snow White. I don't think the typical kid over seven would be afraid of it especially since there is so much comic relief from the dwarfs and the cuddly animals though the film is somewhat of a curious mix. I do find Snow White's singing and speaking voice annoying as well as her role of little homemaker but you have to remember she is a product of the late 1930's and appreciate the film as a hallmark of that time."
3,"A Disney Original Remastered, Blu-Ray & DVD in package","If you've seen Snow White on VHS and now have a HD TV with Blu-Ray or simply have an upconverting DVD player, you'll enjoy owning this treasure, however ask yourself: ""Is it worth the money?""Consider the following...I love that they've packaged both the Blu-Ray and DVD editions together. Sounds really good doesn't it? Well, it would be if this was a film like say 'Die Hard' that wasn't originally done in older animation-style. Frankly it seemed a bit of a waste to produce this in Blu-Ray as when the DVD was viewed as 'upconverted', the picture looked the same to me as the Blu-Ray.The reason for my 3 out of 5 star rating:Perhaps it's my set-up and the way I'm using it, but if you have a good upconvertion, you may want to save a couple bucks and not spend them on this particular set.I still love the movie, but I don't think I love it 'more' on Blu-Ray."
3,"Great product, bad service.","Amazon always has provided great products and great service.However this DVD came from Royal Video and was for my granddaughter's4th birthday. It was to arrive in 3-21 days. I had hoped for thesoonest. It took 23 days!! The video was great, but I will neverorder anything coming from Royal Video again, and will only stickwith Amazon!"
1,Very disappointed!,"I was extremely disappointed and irritated with this DVD. The disc I received is defective. There is about 20 minutes missing from the tape due to this defect. I used it in my DVD player and I tried it in another DVD player and the same defect came thru in both players. The DVD is basically worthless with these defects.What makes it worse, is that it was a Christmas gift for my grandchildren.I will never purshase merchandise from this venue again."
1,Screwed!,"I agree with the other sellers! This was in Korean. It should definitely say in the description that it is in another language, since this is the U.S."
5,Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs Diamond Edition,Excellent movie. I had not seen the movie in years and really enjoyed it. It was nice to be able to enjoy it with my daughter. Excellent color. Would highly recommend this movie to anyone!!
5,Classic,"This classic movie is one of the best movies made. You have a princess, love, and happily ever after. Adventure for all."
1,Shoe organizer,"Ordered this item, but slow and super expensive delivery charges. Cancelled, but it was mailed out anyhow and I refused acceptance."
3,Basic Number Puzzle - little flimsy,"This puzzle is a good deal for the price, but I didn't love it. My 2-year old son learned the alphabet using a wonderful, sturdy wooden alphabet puzzle so I wanted to get this product to help him learn his numbers. This puzzle is a basic numbers puzzle which is what I was looking for. However, the puzzle pieces are pretty thin, which sometimes makes it difficult for little fingers to get the pieces to stay in place. I like the design and the ""see inside"" pictures, but wish the whole thing was a bit more hefty."
1,HAS NOT arrived yet,"How can I review a product which has not arrived, although I ordered it in November?"
1,Zebra to Elephant...,"Give me a break! The title is offensive. Who would want to read a book with such a title? Certainly not this introvert. Maybe one of those stripe changing zebras? I'm an introvert, I'll never be an extravert, could never be an extrovert, and would never want to be an extrovert. The author (and his editor) obviously do not understand what an introvert or an extrovert is."
4,Rembrandt,"A little too episodic, but otherwise a touching, elegiac movie. Mr. & Mrs. Laughton's scenes are so well done, especially the replay they do of their meet-cute right before she dies. Lip-smacking sets & costumes as one would expect from a Korda production. Super-rare opportunity to see Gertrude ""STAR!"" Lawrence on screen; she's wonderful, too. Spot-on Rembrandty cinematography. A joy. 8/10"
1,rediculous,This book is a waste of time for the informed reader. The author tries to scare the uneducated. The facts are qualitative and have no valid references. I had to put the book down and never finished the last 20%.
5,swedish meatballs,"Franklin Boutros ""Franky"" has no idea what he is talking about at all. please totally disregard his opinion. comparing atg to the likes of korn is just idiotic.chances are, if you're reading reviews for at the gates, it's probably because your favorite metalcore band was recently compared to them. majority of metalcore bands got their sound from swedish death metal like at the gates or in flames. however, they all fall short to achieve that sound. although slaughter of the soul is their most produced, least technical album, it still is worth buying. catchy riffs and unique vocals make this a great album to own. make sure you buy the re-release with extra tracks including a slayer cover.oh and Franklin Boutros ""Franky"",old metallica = thrash metalkorn = nu metalat the gates = melodic death metallisten to more music."
5,Will forever be an influential melodic death classic,"I've heard these songs so many times but they just never get old. The best tracks are 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9. I like the :""Legion"" cover alot. This band paved the way for many of today's great bands. Be sure to check out the Bjorler's other band The Haunted and Lindberg's efforts in Nightrage and The Crown."
4,Bergman is as beatiful as ever,"Excellant romantic thriller from director Hitchcock starring Grant and Bergman. Bergman is as beatiful as ever and Claude Rains gives a great performance. The DVD transfer is pretty good. Minus a few errors and no bonus features, over all its crisp and clean. A must for Hitchcock and/or Bergman (one of my favorites) fans."
1,rip off,This blu-ray release is a total rip off. The picture quality is no better (in fact worse) than the Criterion DVD issued a few years ago. I'm returning mine. Don't be fooled!
3,okay...,It is a good movie in which to see Grant and Bergman act together but the story just wasn't there. It was rather boring and incomplete.
5,Untypically Grant,Cary Grant does a wonderful job in this movie & it is atypical for me. Highly recommend that you view this movie.
5,My fave',"Wow! this is truly an amazing film. Hitchcock's best, Grant's best, Bergman's best and so on. It is one of the darkest, and deepest roles for Grant, and the best of hitchcock, or any other film! Underrated, even at 5 stars! Bergman plays the daughter of a convicted Nazi traitor. Grant is the American agent who presses her to do some undercover work with Claude Rains... and both fall in love with her. Gripping and powerful, there will never be a better film than this. See it... NOW!"
5,A MUST read for the beginning stage manager!!,"Great guide for beginners-enjoyable, quick read. Down-to-earth. It could serve an experienced stage manager because of it's emphasis on inter-personal relationships backstage and their effect on the production. Other books on the subject don't deal as well with the authority issues that stage managers must contend with. This book could be a text for Intro to Theatre classes at the high school or college level. I wish I'd read it when I was starting out."
1,Disappointing,I was very disappointed in the selections included in this compilation cd. There isn't one track that I want to listen to again. I regret buying this.
5,History or .....,For our midterm my professor stated that we needed to stick to the 3rd chapter of Gelvin and NOT apply it to current events. Gelvin's historical accounts sound like current events in US and the World. Apparently the world's politicians never read this book so we are repeating it.
1,Most disappointing.,"We have read/studied Mr. George's book. Having, also,read the transcripts of his two or three(?) meetingswith the renowned, Vaishnava scholar, author, teacher,preceptor, Srila A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada;therefore could read his influence throughout.What has annoyed us to no end is to witness the lack,on Mr. George's part, of intellectual integrity/honestyin his choosing to quote various popular/mundanepersonalities and avoiding to cite the controversial/uncommon. Not giving credit, where just credit is due;thus making, said, tainted with ego.Therefore, the work is viewed by us, as a simple attemptat name and fame; and will be relegated, to the dustbin ofhistory, as just another work of mental speculation, pennedby yet another, fallible, personality."
4,"Average light, high in price.","I usually review only tactical level lights, but this light caught my attention at Big Lots because it was $4, and it came with 3 Duracells already. I bought it, and I think its a good light for the average joe. I definitely do not recommend that you buy it here though, get it for $4 at a different store.Pros:Clear,bright, centered beamRuns on AAA batteries, easy to findRubber grip is great, especially if using in slippery environmentsBright color makes it easy to find (does not glow in the dark)Has a small clip so you can clip it temporarily to your pantsHas a lanyardTailcap switchCons:Does not travel too farOther than it being for only close range, it's a descent light. I'd probably still go for a microlight though."
2,"Go easy with the glue, it takes more than you get..","As much money as you pay it looks like the desk would have had more screws to hold it together. Honestly the whole side with the drawers are basically held together by glue. They give you this 1oz bottle of glue and expect you to glue the whole thing together. That thing set in my living room floor for two days until I had time to go to the store to buy more glue so I could finish putting it together. After it was put together, the desk is fairly nice but for 130.00 it should have been better constructed than it was. The drawers--completely held together by glue, small screws hold the handles on but the entire drawer is nothing but glue, so forget putting anything heavy in them."
3,ok,First of all - this disc is prohibitively expensive. Secondly - I had heard much about the sound quality before hearing it but in reality I found it surprisingly small scale - especially the strings which are too recessed and are often completely overwhelmed by the brass section. And dare I say that I found Janet Baker less moving than Christa Ludwig on Mehta's 1970's recording? This IS a great interpretation but I don't find it definitive and prefer MehtA on DeccA with the ViennA Philharmonic(A). And it's much cheapA.
3,"Hyped by the British, but not competitive","Britain has needed a great conductor for a long time, and in simon Rattle they got one. This caused the critics to wildly extol everything he recorded in Birmingham, and you will sitll see this Mahelr Second listed as a first choice. But except for Janet Baker's singing, this isn't first-rate Mahler, lacking a lot in comparison to great recordings by Bernstein, Stokowski, and even Mehta with the Vienna Phil on Decca. The CBSO simply doesn't come close."
3,Soulmusic or Fleshmusic?,"I heard one song, ""In My Life,"" which is so agreeably positive. So, I expected a few more cuts with the same positivity on this CD. Not the case. If you're not tired of the repetitious lust in music now-a-days, this CD will please you.I'm not saying she can't sing, just a title ""soulsinger"" should vent more soul-music, instead of a majority of flesh-music."
1,Terrible transmission quality,"This 2.4 G (?) phone is unable to send or receive calls anywhere in my house except within 10 ft of base station.I bought the base + 4 handsets with the hopes of having communication throughout my house. As it is, all the handsets are useless and I have to stand within eyesite of the base unit."
4,Toshiba PDR 3300,"I brought the card because of the low price. I have a Toshiba PDR 3300 and encountered the same problems as previous buyers. Rather than return the product, I contacted Toshiba and found that I needed to upgrade Toshiba's Firmware version from 1.02 to 1.04 for the 128mb card to work. The 128mb sd card will not work with the software that comes with the camera. You can download the software at www.toshiba.com/taisisd/isd_svc/svcdsc/m3300upgrade.htmOnce I uploaded the upgrade the card work wonderfully.."
1,Would be great if it worked,"I started using these cards a few months ago. Bought two of them. They were a lot cheaper than those from Lexar, Simple, etc. However, you get what you pay for.I first found out how bad these cards are when I bought a Sharp Zaurus. Apparently Sandisk does something funky in the hardware on these cards that keeps them from behaving like everyone else's cards. Whatever they have done keeps it from working on the Zaurus.While looking through some other products here , I am now seeing that they are not working on things such as the Toshiba e740 (which I also own). The card seemed to work on mine, but only half way. I had been attributing problems to the PC2002 OS on it. Turns out I was a bit mistaken.So, if you can get this card to work in your device, good luck to you. If you can't, get rid of the card and buy something from another manufacturer."
1,DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM EURO-PRO,Impossible to find replacement bags!!! Only used it 6 times and already the cord retract does not work.
5,very thorough chem book...,"Our school recently upgraded to this chemistry book for the honors level. personally, i like it a lot. all the math examples have clear instructions, and the pictures really helped. a few chapters were a bit fuzzy, but more intense topics (ie, subatomic particles & thermo) made up for any lack of information. ... . i would definitely recommend purchasing a SAT II review book, as it contains valuable information that goes along nicely with the book itself. the book covers nearly everything one would find in a college-prep chemistry course, so i would definitely recommend taking the SAT II in may."
1,unacceptable,"Sound quality totally unacceptable. The phone had tremendous echo, making callers' speech often hard to understand. Am finding myself very disappointed not only by this, but by many of the new cordless phones I've tried. Thought 900 mHz and 2.4 Gig phones would be better, but remember getting better sound quality from the old analog cordless units.Back it goes!"
2,Cute and Light but static,"I too suffered static by the Microwave. Noticeable especially in the Kitchen while heating up supper, tea etc. Sometime I have to walk 50 feet away to get away from the static. I would not recommend this phone. My first experience with 2.4's. Not a good one."
2,Disposable Phone???,"I've had this phone for about a year. Its been pretty dependable and even survived several drops on the floor. Unfortunately call quality goes in the tank when using it while running the microwave. Also it seems incredibly difficult to get a replacement battery for this phone. [Several retailers] don't carry the battery. Even the [manufacturer's] website doesn't appear to carry it. What a pain! Do yourself a favor, buy a different phone."
1,"""Ugliest"" book I ever read","This book follows the Amazon Kindle pattern of turning literature in a commodity. The Kindle edition is replete with typos and it is cut-and-pasted into a piece of trash. This continues the Amazon practice of machine-scanning of books without any consideration for the reader. One gets the same sensation when handling $1 scissors stamped-out in a Chinese factory. I have no complaint about the book itself or the translation but found myself constantly put-out over the ""ugliness"" of the presentation. There is no elegance to Kindle reading, although I prefer it from a technology standpoint and have just about worn out the second. Still, I think about just going back to the Public Library for books that look as though someone cared."
3,well it was a freebie,.it was a freebie. it was a paperless book. why not take advantage of it right? not like WHOA! book!
5,Bought The Iliad for my Kindle app.,"I bought both of Homer's classics for my Kindle app. I don't own both of them except for my Kindle copies, and I am a fan of the classics. I also had other novels, as well, but somehow my app deleted them."
2,Misleading cover image is of wrong version!,"If you rely on the user-submitted image of the cover attached to this item, you might think that this is the highly-praised modern Richmond Lattimore translation (which would be one of the great bargains of classic literature!). However, the actual version you download will be an 1864 prose translation by ""Edward, Earl of Derby."" Not bad, if you like older language, don't mind prose instead of poetry, and can't afford any but the free version, but it certainly isn't Lattimore's translation."
1,Translation is Everything,"As with the Bible, the translation or more specifically the translator is key. Not everyone can move poetry in one language into another. This is true of the Iliad, certainly true the the myriad mistranslations of the Bible. Kindle must include this information on the books being offered. There is no way to assess whether the book is worth downloading if the translator is not advertised. The Iliad and the Bible have suffered greatly at the hands of hacks and those who intentionally want to 'improve' the text. Please include the translator when presenting classic works. If it's just a reprint of someone else's work, (as so many reissues of the Bible are) than please say so. Republishing crap does not improve the smell."
3,roman vers,"i would prefer the greek names of the gods used but instead the roman ones are. thats just me. not much poem, but still readable for the price."
1,Unhappy at the lack of response from the vendor,"The product did not work when assembled. After taking it appear and replacing a series I parts (an additional 25% of the original price),the product now works. There was no response from the vendor when emailed my Amazon. Any saving realized by purchasing the heater on line is gone as a result of the product not working and the lack of response by the vendor. May not buy another product through Amazon!!!!!"
3,Proper utility but be careful,It's a nice cover and keeps the heater protected but be very careful having it on in the wind. The flat surface acts like a sail and even with a sand base and full propane tank - knocked the heater over. Caused damage to my heater.
1,Duralast Cover (Black) Does Not Fit Fire Sense Heaters,"This review is specific to the ""Duralast Cover (Black)"" option available for purchase. I purchased this cover thnking it was actually a better version of the ""black"" cover since it's MSRP was $10 higher. It turns out, the Duralast cover is just a cheap, vinyl cover that looks more like a black tarp than a cover. It is not felt lined, nor will it fit Fire Sense Heaters. The cover top diameter is a bit too small to fit over the heater and even if it did, the cover does not reach the ground.Do Not Buy this option by mistake. I ordered the ""black"" cover and it fit my heater like a glove. The ""Duralast Cover (Black)"" is a waste of money!!! Fortunately, Amazon took it back with no issues. I suggest Amazon remove this as an ""option"" from the ""Fire Sense Full Length Zippered Cover (Black)"" page as it's not the same quality nor the same product."
1,Heater Cover,"The cover was very hard to put on and take off, requiring two people. However, the worst problem is that when the cover is on, it crease something of a sail effect and the slightest wind will cause the heater to blow over, unless you have it tied down. This results in damaging the top of the heater.The cover is thus basically worthless."
2,Very shallow view of Italian business culture,"This book provides a glimpse of the Italian business culture that is hardly worth the price. I was better served by Passport Italy, where I got some context for the behavior and values of the culture."
3,Not one of the best Avon True Romances,"I was utterly disappointed by this book. But I, being the hopeless romantic that I am, found this book to be a bit boring and droning on and on until the very last five or so pages, when it really got good and interesting. Although, if you like just a bit of romance, then this book is for you. Don't get me wrong, it was ingeniously written (like all of Cabot's work), but I'm just saying that it gets a little boring to those romantics at heart. If you like the Avon series, there are many others that are even better than this. Personally, I recommend ""Tess and the Highlander"" and ""Samantha and the Cowboy""."
3,Ummmm....,"I was really disappointed with this MC book. I loved all her other books. And I love historical romances. So naturally I was thrilled to her about this book.1st: Nicola is annoying2nd: She's always romantisizing3rd: I felt that this book had no real depth to it.Oh, well!"
4,a fun read,"This is just a fun read, by am author who knows how to amuse. This is not Charlotte Bronte...doesn't claim to be. I love to be able to read a novel for fun and not have my values mocked. While this one is edgy and sexy, it never crosses any lines. This book is what it claims to be, and I intend to read all her books, under several of her pen names...they are already downloaded."
4,Not one of the best,"I recently got interested in Avon True Romance books by my best friend, who's quite a romantic. She recommended me Anna and the Duke, Emily and the Scot, and Victoria and the Rogue. I bought this book because, when I read the back, it sounded quite good and also because it is written by Meg Cabot, author of the Princess Diaries series and Victoria and the Rogue. I personally thought that Victoria and the Rogue was one of the best books in the Avon True Romance series thus far, and because Meg Cabot is such a great writer I thought Nicola and the Viscount would be a good read, too. I was wrong. Nicola did not have a personality whatsoever, and the plot wasn't as good as Victoria and the Rogue. However, you may think otherwise. Buy Nicola and the Viscount (if you have not already done so) and read for yourself. Enjoy!"
3,"Good Neo-Prog Like ""Big Generator"" From Yes","This is a good, but not great, neo-prog album. About half the songs are excellent, in particular ""Wasting Time;"" the other half are forgettable AOR.It's clear Billy Sherwood & Co. had been listening to Yes' Big Generator album a lot, and if you like Big Generator, you'll like this."
3,I liked it but,"Just thought there may have been a bit more to it. I was disappointed that the endings of each title were not concluded. Maybe I'm just spoilt through the authors other novels and wanted the stories to have an actual ending.Still, the warmth was there."
3,Maeve Binchy,"I've read every book this author has released so far. I enjoy them all. I like the one story books better than her short stories. I really like the way she has woven a lot of the characters from different novels together with new characters in her newest books. She will surely be missed by a lot of people. If you like Irish stories, you'll love Maeve Binchy."
3,"""Princess Diaries"" less royalty plus magic","Rachel is 14. She lives on Manhattan and worries about boys, clothes, and school -in the same order. Things stop being normal when Rachel discovers that her mom and young sister are witches and have magic abilities. Could she use it to her advantage? Even better, could she have these abilities?The book is fun and easy reading for tweens and teen girls, with magic twist to otherwise standard plot and conflicts.My daughter enjoyed this book, as well as the others in these series, but we decided to borrow them, not to buy. We did it mainly based on my kid's definition of ""I would probably not re-read this book"", and I agreed with her, that it would lose most of the charm on the second reading.Unless you have more than two readers for these series, or you are hard fan of chick lit, I would recommend borrowing the book at the library instead of buying it."
3,Daughter Bored,"I had high hopes for this book for my daughter as it is an extensive series and deals with issues of puberty (my daughter is about to turn 11).My daughter is an avid, almost obsessive reader. She gave this book a try, but after a third of the book she gave up on it. I asked her why. ""Daddy it's just so boring! Nothing happens!"". I said she should just read on and give it a chance. ""but daddy, I've read 100 pages!"". Seemed like a fair effort to me, and I handed her her next book.I know this series is highly regarded, an I don't want to dissuade anyone from reading it. But if your daughter has already read all the Harry Potters and all the Hunger Games, ad mine has, this book and this series might be too young."
3,100% cheese!!!You`ll love it!!!,"This film is about a yoghurt which comes to life and kills people!! You get the picture of what type of film this is?Anyway, a white substance is found in the snow which seems to be coming out of the ground so one policeman decides to taste it, as you do, and the next thing you know it`s being sold in supermarkets all over the country. `Can`t get enough of the stuff` and such tunes repeatedly play on tv ads for the product and the whole country can`t get enough of it. Except one boy who notices it moving in the refrigerator and realises the dangers and how it`s transforming his family`s personalities who are trying to force him to eat it. Anyway, he escapes and along with `Mo`(Moriarty), another pretty woman and `chocolate-chip Charlie` (What kind of name is that!), try to fight the stuff and stop it from destroying their country.The acting isn`t bad, the ad-campaigns are a laugh and this one is definetely one to watch for lovers of this type of unrealistic movie."
3,yum!,"Strange white glop in the form of a popular treat (like yogurt or ice-cream) takes over the minds and bodies of society. A cool, slick film that doesn't take itself to seriously. Not scary in the least but interesting. Theres a few memorable scenes such as when one of the characters, in ""thing"" like fashion, reveals himself to be an agent of ""the stuff"". Its a jaw-dropping experience. You'll know it when you see it. Pretty decent acting in this one. Not the usual tripe we have come to expect. The effects are decent. Still, something is holding this film back from being above average. oh well. Its different. Worth picking up for the right price."
1,Maybe I missed something...,"Maybe I missed something, but to me this book is a collection of outtakes that should have stayed out -- proof that, if you have the right credentials and/or know the right people, you can get anything published. Or it's Vorpsi's practical joke, making us buy something that's total [nonsense] because we don't understand it (because there's nothing there to understand), and therefore making us think we are lacking, rather than the artist.Bottom line: Save your money."
2,Enough of this brazilian stuff already.,"By this time in the PM's career, it was time to move beyond the whole brazilian influence that was featured on this as well as the 2 preceding PMG records (both far superior IMO), First Circle and Still Life (Talking). ""Beat 70"" and ""Every Summer Night"" rank among the ""cheesiest"" things Pat has ever done. ""Have You Heard"" is becoming a classic PMG tune, and ""Are We There Yet?"" is Lyle Mays at his finest, but the rest of the disc is pretty weak. ""Beat 70"" and ""Every Summer Night"" rank among the ""cheesiest"" things Pat has ever done. This isn't a bad CD, but I would only recommend it for the Pat Metheny/PMG completist."
1,really bad one,"you cannot even control your movement.... it is a disaster for beginners, so if u r a beginner, don't buy it.... maybe good looking... nothing else good."
3,"OK, but first one is much better.","This movie is OK, but the first one by far is better. Some of the action scenes were completely unbelievable and although the surprise ending was good, the movie has some pretty lame dialogue. Also the fade to black before every single new scene was very annoying."
4,Heavy Metal?,"After falling in love with the original Heavy Metal for its decidance of sex, drugs and rock & roll, I was a bit surprised at the muted quality of this movie. Its not as though the magazine has toned down that much. I mean there was plenty of T&A but none of the questionable morals. HM2K does out shine its predecesor for having a more complete story, but it was not exactly what I was expecting (especially since it have several opportunities of the sex). For people who want adult oriented animation, look for Heavy Metal 2000 and the original, but if you have only money for one and do not have small children at home, buy the original first."
1,Pathetic!,"When you hear sequel or the ""updated"" version of anything these days, you either have to shudder with fear, or approach it apprehensively. Such is the case with this movie, which is complete garbage. The animation is a slight improvement over the original, but most of the time, it is just goofy to look at(the ""surprise"" villan in the final scene for example). This is nothing more than a gory, porno movie with all of the necessary ingredients that make porno movies: lame characters, absurd action scenes, and a ridiculous ""plot."" And i've heard better music in some video games than in this movie. The original is much better than this, and its better if you see that one instead. Expect this film to show only during late at night on HBO or Cinemax, which is a good thing actually, considering this movie."
3,May be...,"I love the firts Heavy Metal but the second, I don't know.I see this 2 times and it's not a bad movie but it's not the first Heavy Metal...."
1,"Bonus stuff way cool, but the film itself STINKS!!",The story of this film would have been better had they used the so-called film adaption of the summer 1999 magazine...when i read that i was blown away and couldn't wait for the film to be released. Now i can see why this film was never released theatrically. The 2D Animation reminds me of saturday morning cartoons.. The 3D animation for the spaceships doesn't blend well with the 2D stuff. What's with all the fade to black after every other scene ? Felt like i was watching something on tv with the commercials missing. Music snippets didn't last too long.. all around crap... I love the sndtrk... I still buy the magazine... And yeah I own the DVD and wouldn't give it up. Heavy Metal collector the last 15 yrs. the 1980 film was by far better
4,Better than I thought,"It took me a while to decide to buy this movie, since many reviews butchered it extensively. One day I summoned my courage, entered Amazon, and ordered it, figuring that, as a worst-case scenario, I was going to get a dose of animated gore and unnecesary sex.Well... I was surprised. There is a storyline, there are well devined characters, it entertained me throughout the story. Al the ingrdients are in: There is a lot of dead people, the heroine is bad-assed as ever (reminded me a lot of Taarna, probably on purpose... No bird, though), the subtle and not-so-subtle sexual content is extensive, and the bad guy dies horribly at the end. What more do you expect?Granted: It`s no Steven Spielberg material, but it is a good movie, recommended!"
4,"Not ""bad"", just has nothing to do with Heavy Metal","This is not a ""bad"" movie, it just has absolutely nothing to do with Heavy Metal. It's more like the anime movies popular at the time, which were serious cartoons with a science-fiction plot.If you're expecting a sequel to Heavy Metal, don't buy this - Heavy Metal 2000 is a completely different movie which makes use of the Heavy Metal brand name. But it's still a good movie."
2,doesn't sit right,"I like the idea of this organizer. HOWEVER, the shelves do NOT sit straight like in the photograph. There is a lot of space - it holds about 60 diapers. But the 'shelves' droop forward once you put anything in them. I'm not even talking about heavy stuff. I mean like bibs and pacifiers. Great photo, just didn't pan out in real life."
5,.prta,".buena calidad , lo que más gusta es la calidad , se lo recomendé a los amigos, es bueno el producto"
4,Good all around organizer,"I got this organizer to make the most of the tiny space we have in our home. It really is a nice design, and it has a lot of potential. I love this organizer, I wish that it came in other colors besides white and green. A blue and pink might be ideas, but for now it's green. I figure I will even use this after my tot is out of diapers, to store things like toys or little things in the closet if I hang it from the rod."
1,Velcro doesn't stay,It only took 2 weeks for the velcro adhesive to fail and the entire organizer fell to the ground. I did not overload the organizer at all. Do not buy this if you need to attach with the dresser top option. I also agree with previous reviews regarding how the pockets sag.
4,Works well for me,"There seem to be a lot of complaints about this organizer. But it works fine for me. It is true that the pockets can sag a little, but it probably all depends on what you put in them and how much you care. The items I have in my organizer are diapers, a tissue box, a small container of cotton swabs, package of wipes, a tube of baby gel and a bottle of baby lotion. It works well for me attached to the changing table. My changing table does consist of slats, so it was easy to install using the velcro tabs. The only part that I did not like was trying to install the organizer to be straight across - it is hard to align both velcro tabs exactly the same height. All in all, I am happy with the product. Mine is a blue color on the trim, not green (I got mine at Target)."
4,Fun and different type of game,"I bought this for my 7 yr old daughter for Christmas. We have had fun playing it. She likes feeling grown up and ""shopping"". You can use your own store ads to go ""shopping"" to give a change to the game. It teaches how to read ads, and shop for the best price."
4,I can't stand Beyonce but I must say...,"I can't stand HER and because of that haterism I forgot how great the Destiny's Child actually was when they were together. Great cd, it'll take you back to when music was still good and before it started going downhill! Great buy."
2,AVOID WASTE OF MONEY,"I bought this CD thinking it would relax me after a long hard day at work, all it has managed to do is increase my blood pressure. Elza's voice is way out of tone and disturbing at times. Maybe she should take some voice lessons before attempting to record a CD...... the reason two stars were given is that the music is OK until Elza opens her mouth....... save your money..... Yanni's music is much more relaxing and you get your money's worth."
5,"Wonderful, heartwarming, reminiscent","If you are a person of a certain age you will cherish this book. If you are younger than that, you will read what you may have missed in your childhood. Reading IN THE KINGDOM OF THE FAIRIES brought back to me a time when a relationship between a small child and an adult outside of the family was not questioned or prohibited. Sometimes it takes a person who is not related (or closely related) to take away the...not loneliness but the, sameness? that may happen when people live with each other day after day. It can create a bit of mystery to enliven the imagination.Susan Coyne has written her memoir with care and sensitivity about her five-year-old self. She has shown that there are people in this world who care about feeding and filling young minds with beauty, humor, imagination. She has shown that relationships through letters themselves can last a lifetime (Somehow I don't see young people of today remembering their text messages.)"
2,Content for highschoolers,"For beginners only! The content is written for someone who doesn't have any background with quality control in an industrial setting. Basically one course in statistics and food chemistry will greatly exceed the knowledge presented in this book. The information that is presented is clear and well written, but lacking in depth or actual applicability. I was disappointed in the amount of applicable equations, tables and data, especially based on the title of the book and the academic background/experience of the author. The 200 pages are a result of a very small book size. This book wasn't worth the price."
2,More Garage Rock,This is New York garage rock with a big man's voice heading up the band. The songs aren't as catchy as the bands contemporaries but they doo seem to be as loud. This one's only for the folks who really like the scene.
5,"get ready, get set, cause here comes the electric sweat!","this is a very, very fantasmagorical cd! the mooney suzuki is in my opinion the best f-ing band alive! i saw them back in november and i just fell in love with them... they rock so much... like sammy once put it, ""... this rock thing is comming back. People ask me, can the Mooney Suzuki save rock? Well, let me tell you this, people in New York City, and the Mooney Suzuki, never knew rock was in trouble. How can we save rock if it was never in trouble?"""
1,"Poor quality, broke after 1 hour use","I've read many great reviews about this mp3 player on this site and other sites, so I decided to get one myself.When I got the player I immediately regretted. The player was bulkier than I expected and the contruction feels cheap, when I remove the battery and the USB storage unit I can see chasis of the player is poorly made.The features are ok and although the controls weren't perfectly intuitive it shouldn't take long to get familiar with them.After using it for 1 hour I accidentally gave it a slight bump, it looked ok at first then when I pressed the controls the unit died and never came back up, so I had to return the unit for a refund.bottomline:if you're tight on your budget but you want a flash mp3 player with many features, otherwise pay a little more for something with better quality"
5,Hilarious!!!,"I have enjoyed this show from the beginning, and some of the funniest episodes are in the first 2 seasons. I am very glad that I bought this DVD set!"
2,South Park = Funny -- DVDs are awful :(,"Anyone that would buy this knows what to expect... the cartoons are hilarious.Unfortunately, I am very disappointed with this DVD set. The sound is very quiet, so you'll have to crank your volume. The video is TERRIBLE.... how can you screw up transferring computer animation to DVD!?!??! The outlines of the characters appear speckled in many places and I've seen other complaints about the video being over compressed. The picture is what I'd expect to see if somebody made a 3rd generation VHS copy of the program... it's that bad and THAT noticible.I'll not buy another southpark DVD set, not until they start doing a better job with the transfers."
4,Great Live Recording That Packs A Shem,"It amazes me that someone would write a cd review from a concertthat they went to without having heard the cd. This is NOT thesame band that they heard in Toronto. It's true that David Pack isno longer with the band, but this cd has the awesome vocals of Shem, who was not with them in Toronto. Shem makes all the difference in the world. This is a great opportunity to hear someof their songs Live. There is an amazing version of Time Waits For No One on this cd. All in all this cd is surprising in how good itis considering that David is not on it. This is a must for Ambrosia fans."
3,"This CD is a fun time with sweat, hockey pucks and beer.","The fact that 2MA have two singers with contrasting styles shows they cover all bases with music listeners. The gruff and heavy vocals of Bud and the melodic and smooth vocals of Skate miraculously gel. There are anthemic sing alongs like ""Penalty Box,"" ""Captain Morgan,"" and ""Hockey Junky"" and brute force drivers like ""Fast Car,"" and ""Chug It."" After listening to the CD, I found myself wanting to listen again to the mid-songs. Guitar solos aren't complex, but are plentiful and add a dimension to the songs. Fairly well produced with a gimmick, this CD will have a following."
2,Should Have Been Kept a Secret,"I am being a bit too harsh with the title to my review, but I really did not enjoy this short (but it seems so, so long) story. Just as Conrad's other novel, Heart of Darkness, has symbolism and deeper meanings- so follows the Secret Sharer. Simply, I did not like this book. I would have been completely lost if it were not for the helpful introduction written by Albert Guerard. I read the introduction after reading the story, and it shed a lot of light on the book. Though I did not enjoy the book, I am impressed with the man behind the book- I cannot believe that English is his second language. He also has an impressive personal life history- it seems as if he has experienced everything he writes about, this adds value to his works."
1,DOA!,"Item arrived DOA. Would not work at all in new Nikon D60, and only very slowly in WinXP via card reader, then in collapsed all together. Seller said they'd been having issues with these KingMax cards and that manufacturer said they had resolved issues -- apparently not. Won't buy KingMax again. I've been using a Transcend 2GB 150X card for a year in an 8MP Canon without issue for thousands of pics and video."
3,Below par for Cantus Colln,"I really love Cantus Colln and their work, especially there second Rosenmuller cd. In my book, there is one black mark against this album, and that is the tempo. I just feel all of it is so rushed and inarticulate. It just sounded sloppy after listening to Herreweghe's version of Weinen, Klangen... and Morimer(Hilliard Ensemble). I must say that I universally prefer Cantus Colln's vocal qualities to almost any of Herreweghe's troop. Though I was disappointed at the lack of polish, most people can find something they like on this cd."
3,"Nice pictures, but lacking detail","I bought a copy of DUKW in Action as a reference for my book about US Army port battalion operations on the Normandy beaches. There is some good basic information on the amphibious truck, but this book seems to have been meant for young readers. It's chock full of great photos, but many of the captions lack dates or locations. If you are interested in reading a detailed account of how the DUKW was used in D-Day supply operations, then check outLongshore Soldiers: Life in a World War II Port Battalion"
1,This blows,"All of the good reviews titled ""a music fan"" are all members of the band promoting thier own cd. If you buy this CD and actually enjoy it, you should see a doctor because you may have an inner ear infection. The rythms are completely off and stolen from Dave Matthews Band, Strangefolk, String Cheese Incident, DBB and the list go on. Above all DO NOT BUY THIS CD. If you would like something worthwhile to do with ten dollars then throw it out your car window just like you will do to this CD. Or just light the money on fire because at least that will keep you warm."
1,Are you joking?,"A friend of mine gave me a CD entitled ""Gabriels Groove"" and told me I had to listen to it because it was the most awful creation known to man. I didn't beleive him, but after listening to it just once, I destroyed the CD by throwing it out of my car window. It is by far the worst musical work I have EVER heard. I would seriously pay the asking price of the CD to never hear the music again! By the way, I'm in my third year at Berklee college of music, toured Europe in a Jazz trio for two years and have played with countless famous musicians, so I definately think I'm qualified when evaluating a CD of music. This band needs to go."
1,Horrible investment,If you truly apreciate music you WILL NOT buy this cd. The vocals are horrible and the whole band is off rythm. Go to CD baby and listen for yourself. Whatever fame they have is so undeserved.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This vacuum cleaner is TERRIBLE and a complete waste of money. It overheats very quickly & takes forever to cool off so that you can continue vacuuming. The filters clog up quickly & easily making the vacuum lose suction. There's also hardly any suction when you use the tool attachments. When you empty the canister, dust flies everywhere! We ended up replacing it after only a few months with a Hoover Windtunnel Supreme (HEPA filtration with a special allergen bag) & are much happier with it."
1,Shark bagless,"What a piece of junk! My maid brings her old upright because she won't carry this heavy machine upstairs and it really doesn't clean at all. After a new years party we had some spanish nut halves on our hardwood floor and the vac wouldn't pick any of them up on the hardwood setting with the brush/beater turned off. It would barely move them. If it can't pick a half of a peanut up why even bother wassting all of those watts. After my first test run on the carpet there was nothing in the cannister. Guess my maid's must have cleaned up every spec of dust before I tried it. Another review stated ""wish we had negative numbers."""
3,3 1/2 stars...,This vacuum was absolutely the best thing we had for about a month and then all the sudden it smells like it is going to blow up! Every time we use it now it smells awful like something died in it. I don't know what happened. It smells like it is on fire. If you have a larger house it also shuts down when it gets too hot so we get through about two rooms at a time before having to wait a couple of hours before finishing. It has its pros though as clean up is easy and it did have great suction but as one person stated it does lose power the more stuff that is in the vacuum. The free hand held that came with it is not bad either but it has to be cleaned very frequently...as I use it in the car. It is not a terrible purchase but it is also not the best. I am getting ready to exchange ours at my work because of the warranty it should not be acting like it does.
1,Do not buy this rubbish. Buy a dyson instead.,Every aspect of this cleaner is cheap and worthless. It doesn't pick up nearly the same amount as other cleaners and has quickly been falling apart since I bought it.- The brush head mechanism broke after 5 months.- The lightbulb on the front broke after a week.- The hose popped out of the main body.- Stretching the hose even slightly causes the unit to topple over. It's extremely dangerous and scary to have the whole unit come crashing down on wooden floors. Thankfully it missed me whilst I was crouching to get under the sofa.There's a reason why this cleaner is so cheap. A quick inspection instore would have taught me to avoid this piece of junk.*UPDATE - 8/4/05*My machine has now devloped the overheating problem and has just switched off like the other reviewers describe. I'm leaving the states in a few months so it's not worth buying a new one. The day I leave I'm gonna smash this piece of...um....garbage to bits and buy a Dyson in the UK.
1,Stinks,As like all the others have said it overheats and takes hours to clean the whole house. Would not but this product.
1,Piece of expensive JUNK - Don't waste your money,"This is a horrible machine. It shut off in 10 (or less) minutes. When it shuts off you have to clean ALL the filters which include two filters outside the canister and three inside the canister. After that you have to wait ONE HOUR for it to cool down. This is the cleaning cycle you have to adapt to work with this HORRIBLE vacuum cleaner. So plan on a whole day to vacuum your rugs. Also when you clean the filters, dust gets everywhere. This vacuum also needs to be dusted to keep it clean.... It is a piece of expensive JUNK. I replaced it with a Hoover Tempo bag vacuum. I will never go bagless again."
5,OH MY GAWD!,"When I first read this book, I was 13. It has become one of my favorite books since then. This year, I encouraged my best friend, Charity, to read it. She was very impressed with it as well. It's about... well, I shouldn't ruin the book for you. But read it anyways. It's really good. In fact, I guarantee this book will be your favorite. If you don't think so after you read it, you can send me your address andi will buy the book of you! hehehe."
5,I love the entire series!,"I love this book, and the entire series. This story provides a nice intoduction to Aerial and Irrylath. As I read the series I began to make discoveries and find relationships between the different books in the series. I always enjoy books with surprises and this series certainly has them. I often check it out from the library over and over again because I like it so much."
5,Wonderful!!,"This book was wonderfully written and I could not put it down! If you are looking for a book with action, fantasy, and a little romance this is the perfect book for you! I am looking forward to reading the whole Darkangel Trilogy."
4,Read this in th 80's,I first came across this book years ago; before all this vampire genre came about. I was in elementary school in the 80's and this was a book I came across in the young-adult section of our local library. I read it and loved the story. I checked it out at least 4 more times that I remember. As a young reader I was captivated by the story.
2,Good idea poorly executed.,"I have tried most presentation pointing devices on the market. The Phaser is better than some because it has a trackball instead of a minature joystick or hatswitch. But the Phaser appears to be built very cheaply. It uses mechanical rollers instead of optical technology, and the rollers, which are attached to flimsy little bent wires, easily lose contact with the ball. Perhaps I got a lemon. I returned mine and bought a Gyration Ultra."
2,"Be careful, get the GME322R, not the GME321R","The remote is beautiful, but I could not plug the receiver into my (less than 1 year old) laptop. I was able to plug it into my desktop computer, which is 2 years old. The GME321R has a PS-2 receiver, my laptop is not compatible with it. Apparently the GME322R does have the USB receiver, with a PS-2 adapter included. The laser is very strong. I am now eagerly awaiting the arrival of the GME322R model :). The description of the GME321R does not explicitly state that it is not USB-compatible, so be careful to chose the correct model for your system."
3,Misleading Title,"I bought this for my brother who loves riddles, but this book has more jokes than riddles which was misleading. It probably has one small section of riddles while the rest is all jokes."
1,Born To Bow,"Eric Alterman and Bruce have one thing in common. They both worship the ground Bruce walks on. Eric, and fans like him, that bow at the altar of Bruce need to get a life. The idea that Bruce or Eric have a ""cultural impact"" is just nonsense. Bruce is a talented songwriter and performer and it pretty much ends right there. Making him the focal point of ones life will rob you of time. If Bruce has a message in his songs it's about movement in life and growing up so why can't fans just take the advice he offers and let it rest already."
5,Intelligent Metal,If you are a fan of Dimmu Borgir then this band will blow you away. I wish this album was longer but it really is ear candy!I highly suggest this Album!!!
4,"No La Masquerade Infernale, but still good","Compared to their previous works, there's more techno elements than before, and to be honest, a lot of the atmosphere is gone, but nevertheless this is still a good, solid CD from some of the most respected musicians in the extreme metal scene (although this really isn't extreme metal)."
5,Absolutely Fabulous!,"I cannot say enough positive things about this cookbook! I have made recipe after recipe from it since I first saw Rick Bayless on Emeril Live make the Trout with Macadamias recipe and I was hooked! These dishes are not only wonderfully complex in flavor and utterly delicious but they are also healthful and beyond simple to prepare. My husband has loved every meal I have made from this book. I am working my way through the whole thing and have happy taste buds as a result! If you love a variety of flavors and foods, are short on meal making time most days and are concerned with maintaining a healthy weight, buy this book, you won't be disappointed!"
3,Nice Book,"I bought this gift for my husband since we love mexican food and enjoy watching Rick Bayless on his PBS shows and going to his resturant in Chicago. Book was nicely laid out with pictures, easy to read receipes, description and tips on purchasing ingredients. Can't wait to buy the items and start cooking!"
1,nuts,"Just did my first meal from ""Mexican Every Day"". What a crock.After spending half a day scrounging up a variety of ingredients, and painfully following the ""scoop"" this and ""scoop"" that directions, we ended up with a very mediocre meal. We did the ""Grilled Red-Chile steak with sweet plantains, red onion & chipotle salsa"". The salsa was unremarkable. The plantains & onion were worse. The rub wasn't bad, but very similar to a rub in the original ""Webber Grill Book""That would not be so bad, I mean what celebrity chef doesn't bomb once in a while.However, following the great ""Bayless technique"" cost me a $60 All Clad sauté pan. The recipe calls for ""browning the garlic and tomatillos"" on the stove in a non-stick pan. Being an idiot I followed the ""Great Ones"" instructions. After 30 minutes of scrubbing I am trying to salvage the Pan, but doubt I will be successful..This book was a father's day present and I hope Mr. Baylees reads my response and not my daughter.PS: This ain't my first rodeo"
5,Beautiful!!,This is the absolute best version of Lakme!! Mady Mesple as Lakme is fantastic. The richness and range of her voice are an awe- inspiring performance. I got chills up my spine!!
3,Fun Haunted House Thriller,"This one falls into the ""old school"" file of the horror genre. Little blood and gore, minimal fx, but it remains creepy throughout. The concept of the house living off of its occupants is a neat one and Curtis does a good job slowly building to the inevitable climax. Performances here are all pretty good - Reed and Davis seem to tale the whole thing very seriously. Karen Black is fine, but she always seems so bewildered that the change to her character is not as noticable. The roof and pool scenes are really great. Bares some comparison with The Sentinal, but this one is a much classier affair."
4,This movie is a little cheesy but VERY under-rated.,"This movie has been panned by every reviewer, yet I think it's really, really scary. It's the chauffeur guy- he really makes my blood run cold. I first saw the movie as a kid, and it gave me nightmares. I'm now 29, and last week I rented it again out of curiosity. After all these years, I STILL had a little trouble watching it. The dream sequence-- in which Oliver Reed flashes back to his mother's funeral-- is probably the creepiest, most morbid 45 seconds in all of horror cinema-- the music, the camera work, etc. etc. Overall this is a pretty satisfying horror movie, despite the '70s cheesiness. If you're into Gothic horror, this is a must-see."
5,Brother Against Brother,"This is where brother literally did battle against brother. Kentucky is called a border state (although it is a Commonwealth and not technically a state). As such, they fielded armies for both sides and while their Yankee troops were ruthless and effective, such Rebel outfits as Morgan's Raiders redefined military strategy.Hard to miss with this wealth of interesting history."
3,It must be an Irish thing,"I found this book enjoyable, but I can't give it the accolades others do. While the antics of the characters do occasionally stir a childhood memory or two, I was not drawn particularly to any of them. There are some poignant moments in the last third of the novel which really saved the book from being a disappointment. I wasn't overwhelmed by Angela's Ashes, either, so maybe I am missing something culturally. Overall, a pleasant read but little more."
4,twas intriguing,"Roddy Doyle did a fantastic job on the not so easy task of getting inside a young boy's head in the novel Paddy Clarke HaHaHa. I really enjoyed this book because i was able to make strong connections between my childhood characteristics and Paddy's. It was very interesting to see Paddy's relationships with different people in his life and how he dealt with the hradships that were thrown at him. Paddy also evolved alot as a person throughout this book. He learned alot about himself through his relations with others and become a more conscious young man, a very old 10 yr old. Overall, Paddy Clarke was a very intriuging book, although it was solw in some parts. I do believe that in order to really enjoy this reading you must have a very imaginative and playfull mind."
4,the memories of childhood,"The book Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha by Roddy Doyle reveals the world by the point of Paddy, a 10-year-old boy. The world seen through his eyes is filled with lots of curiosity and unpredictable things. The childhood events are depicted by lively, pure and innocent conversations between Paddy and his friends. Paddy gets to know about the parental conflicts and becomes exposed to the ¡adult¡ world. At the end, he catches the moment that his father hits his mother, and his father leaves the house on the same day. His father comes back home on day before Christmas Eve, and they shake each other¡s hands. His identity formed by having ¡complete¡ family begins to collapse when he first finds out the tension between his parents. However, he figures out his own way of protecting himself from the world that has taught him the life strategy."
3,not my cup of tea,"While this book does an excellent job of capturing what it's like to be a 10 year old boy growing up in Ireland, it just didn't give me much reason to care enough about that boy to really enjoy the book."
4,The World through the eyes of a young man,This book shows Northern Ireland and a town through the eyes of one boy who also has to witness the failing marriage of his parents. where his town grows his family does not. Written in sketches with funny and emotional scenes I enjoyed this book.
5,Rediscover your childhood,Paddy Clarke and his friends grow up in an Irish town called Barrytown. Their games and fun and carefree life is pretty much the story. But what is amazing is how beautifully and authentically the child-mind is pictured. The catch is when you are a child you would probably not be able to enjoy or write such a story and when you have grown up you have lost touch with the child-mind. Roddy Doyle is remarkable in overcoming this and he makes it look so simple. Little sentences and sentiments that make you re-live your childhood. The end is sad but the way a child feels sad without knowing much about the adult world is definitely a fresh read.
4,Knowing yourself again,"This is an important book. Childhood and the view of the small world from a child's height - physically - is beautifully captured and expertly written in a sometimes colloquial tongue which puzzles the intellect and delights the soul. The boys all have faces, yet the words only impart the slightest of detail about the adults in the story, the view of their faces is obscured. It is important in that it takes men (this man at least) back to their particular childhood with spooky deftness."
4,Can't complain,"The score is fine. It came in good condition. The picture on the front is kind of disturbing, though. Haven't seen any typos. The edition looks clean."
3,AVERAGE FILM WITH INTRIGUING PLOT,"This film is well acted and based on a real case from the 1970s. The film has an interesting theme - is being mentally sound a handicap in catching criminal deviants?Eliza Dushku plays an Upstate NY detective with adult onset of schizophrenia. It brought Nietzsche to mind: when you look into the abyss (or monster), the abyss looks back at you. Did her overwhelming drive to capture mentally unbalanced criminals bring on the mental disorder? Or, did the disorder help her with her job and this particular failure, push her off the deep end? Interesting concepts however you look at it. The killing of young girls and their voiced pleas for help to the detective were creepy and the right note for a thriller. The whodunit aspect had the usual red herring and plot twist ending although predictable enough if you were paying attention.Overall, the detective's struggle was overdone and lead to implausible scenarios that mucked this film into the sea of mediocrity."
3,GOOD IDEA! OK FILM!,"I liked this little serial killer film because it had a nice little twist and some disturbing images. The idea of the detective who is wrapped up in this murder case going insane is very intriguing as we don't know if she is actually going insane or if the victims are actually talking to her. The director does a decent job of trying to keep us guessing by throwing the usual suspects in our path, but in the end I figured it out before the killer was revealed.....ah you thought you could fool Mr. Know It All!? ....I think NOT! Regardless this is better than average for this kind of thing and I liked the ending."
3,"Getting better, but not quite there yet.","It's good to see a re-issue of an extremely popular series, and ""The Destroyer"" novels will probably draw interest from history majors as well as those seeking a diversion: Murphy and Sapir tended to use contemporary -- at that time -- social problems and issues as themes.This novel doesn't properly represent a good start for someone first reading a Destroyer novel (try #3 in the series first), but like #1 in the series, it's essential for the collector and certainly not a waste of money.There are, however, two minor points I raise. One, the reissue prices are ridiculous for paperbacks. Two, and probably most disappointing, is the decision not to re-issue the original covers. Man, some of that artwork would definitely drive a teenage boy to pick one up."
5,Always enjoyed this series,I like all the books in this series. I'm working on reading all the ones that I missed in the series back in the 80's. Very enjoyable
4,A great movie... a horrible disc.,"The movie is really a lot like Garfield, except Nermal and Odie. I hope that more people look at the movie instead of the disc. A funny movie, tons of fun for kids as well as adults. The majority of the movie is good, except for the part where Garfield ""snowboards"" on the lunch plate thingamabob.The sound and main menu is good, nothing special, great film quality, good scene selection and language menu... WHAT'S THIS!!!!!!?????? NO SPECIAL FEATURES WHATSOEVER!!! No special features!!! Jim Davis has your mind become jell-o? After all the things you have done you can't come up with any special features? All we get is an inside look at some more movies that look like crap anyways.I was horribly surprised at this. I couldn't believe it.The movie is good. The disc is crap. This movie should be worth no more than ten bucks. Four stars for the movie.One star for the disc."
1,Product Placement Hell,"I might watch this movie again, not because its good though. I may watch it again to count all the product placements, ie: advertisements, in this average lackluster effort. If your an adult that cares about the assault of marketing targteted towards children, this movie is your worst nightmare. I honestly believe I could count over 50 blatant product placements in this movie. I mean blatant too, like extended views of Wendy's advertisements on the TV and long zoom ins on Jon's Macintosh. You'd have to be a kid to not notice. Hmmm, maybe that why theres so many? I have to say shame on you Hollywood for this one. You've taken a legendary cartoon character and pimped him out for product sales..."
2,what have they done to that old mean garfield???,"as i rememeber garfield used to be an old lazy cat and also mean but in yhis movie he is like a kindness itself at some point, and he doesnt like dogs usually and also kittens... but in this movie... yeah ummm... well the point is that the cartoons are much better than this moviestill one thing that wa very well chosen was the voice of this cat, yeah it was great:)"
5,"Garfield, the Movie- Follow Along DVD Review","This is a fantastic way to teach your child to read! This edition, the Follow Along edition, of Garfield, the Movie, has special ""kid friendly"" colorful captions. These captions follow the movie's dialogue exactly. Kids can read the words as they watch the movie. Unlike traditional captions, these captions are in bright colors and are easier to read.The Follow Along edition contains the complete, standard version of Garfield, the Movie, but also has this extra caption feature. If you prefer to watch the standard version, you can merely turn off this captioning feature. Consequently, this DVD is great for every member of the family. The captions on the DVD are available in English and Spanish. A great value and a great learning tool for every member of the family."
2,Garfield--a dissapointment,"I didn't expect it to be any better than the old garfield cartoon series. I was dissapointed. Odie was a real dog--which actually it still worked out ok in the movie. Also, John (the owner) didn't look like the owner in the cartoon series. In the cartoon series, John had glasses etc. I don't know, I had the certain picture of what he was supposed to look like in my mind. Garfield looked like Garfield which I guess is the main thing. The plot was somewhat like Toy Story.I'll have to give credit though. It seemd that Garfield looked and acted like Garfield which I was happy about that.I did enjoy the fact that Garfield acted and said things that would remind of the cartoon series like his ""I hate mondays"" or some of his other lines.Over all, I give this movie 2 stars because of the lack of making it look like the orginial."
2,"Bad DVD, Eh movie.","So the movie is okay. My 7 year old daughter thinks it's the cutest thing. My problem is the DVD itself. It hijacks your DVD player and forces you to watch about 10 minutes of previews. You cannot fast forward, you cannot skip to the menu, skip to the next track, you cannot even stop the DVD player. Huh? Bad move 20th Century Fox."
4,Not Bad,"I think this will be good, but not great. I like the fact that it's one of the most adored comic book characters, but from what I saw, it looks a little different than the comic (like he talks instead of thinking) but we'll just have to see to find out for shure."
2,"Ok, not as funny as I thought it would be.","It wasn't as funny as I thought it would be, but it was clever and I liked the adventure concept."
3,Garfield Misses the Litter Box,"Growing up with the fat cat I looked foward to one day seeing the orange one on the big screen. I loved Garfield's humor and smart ass tone. Even the cartoon series in the 80s gave him an edge. The movie whitewashed him. Despite Bill Murray's great voice-over performance, he couldn't rise above the lame script and misdirection. Still, it does have a little charm. Kids seem to enjoy it. Maybe this is a Garfield for the next generation."
4,Pretty Good Movie,"This movie was definitely an answer to all of us Garfield comic fanatics, and is very humorous. If you have kids, this is a great movie. My brother and sister watch this movie all the time and love to see the animals. It's a great way to keep the kids occupied when you have to do something, and Garfield's voice is very much close to his original in the cartoon making it seem like the original. It has the same original cat hate dog humor, and it would make a great gift. Who doesnt love a fat cat who likes lasagna?"
1,unadulterated junk,"My son has been watching this and I find it unspeakably insipid. Silly stories, boring characters, etc. The animation is also mediocre, with characters moving too much in needless gestures. It is all irritating background noise.This is not one that parents can watch with their kids and pushes the minimal value of the newspaper comic way beyond the limits of its value."
4,Your cat should love this film and lasagna.,"The voice of Garfield in other animated cartoon (1982-91) used to be Lorenzo Music, who used to be the voice of ""Carlton the Doorman"" on the CBS,Rhoda: Season Onetv series (1974-78). He passed away from lung and bone cancer on August 4, 2001.In this live action and animated motion picture, the voice of ""Garfield"" is Bill Murray (NBC's Saturday Night Live, 1977-1980).Garfield performs his usual hi-jinxs around the neighborhood getting milk from the milkman and stealing apple pies. He's been so bad. But he really likes his master to take care of him. His master meets a lady veterinarian (Jennifer Love Hewitt) who forced a dog on him. Well, he takes the puppy home and Garfield is feeling so rejected.Actually, it's a very cute film that the whole family can enjoy. Garfield even visits Los Angeles Union Station.Sequel:Garfield - A Tail of Two Kitties(2006). Also known as ""Garfield 2: The Prince and the Paw-per"" in the United Kingdom."
4,Garfield a real treat,I enjoyed the video on PSP my son is 12 and he really enjoyed the psp video. Great Price too.
1,Boring.,"I hated this film. This movie is bad, but being a Garfield fan for a long time, I had to give it a try. The story (if you can call it that) is basically a plot for Garfield to rescue Odie who has been dog napped and to get into funny situations. Garfield has some very funny lines (down dumb dog) and gets into some very funny situations and Bill Murray was terrific as the voice with just the right adjustments here and there to be funny. Other than that the story is just enough to hold together the ""plot"", the human acting is painful (Breckin Meyer & Jennifer Love Hewitt need to fire their agents) and the dialogue is corny. Also I thought they should have made Jon the loser with women that he is in the comic strip and Odie should have been a CGI character as well. Overall its not a masterpiece of film, but if you go in knowing what to expect it is funny at times. This movie is for Garfield fans and parents who want to take their kids to a family film."
2,Sex no story,This book is not a historical romance. Boring characters. I could not finish it and plan to take it to the used book store.
2,Didn't hold my interest,"I don't think this book was awful but it was not good either. There wasn't much of a story to hold my interest: A mousy widow hooks up with a returned scoundrel for one season for an affair. I expected to enjoy stimulating backs-and-forths between the two main characters and was disappointed to find them totally unmatched. The widow never really evolved from mousy to an interesting rounded person and the scoundrel never became the kind of alpha male romance hero that you would root for and sigh over. His smacking her bottom scene didn't excite me in the least, I am not much for physical abuse even if it supposed to be ""sexy."" There is a time and place for this kind of thing but I don't think a mainstream historical romance novel is. I kept reading on hoping the book would go somewhere story-wise but it didn't."
5,ONE OF MY TOP 3 ALL TIME FAV EROTIC ROMANCE NOVELS,"HEY, MAYBE MY TASTE ARE SIMPLE, BUT THIS BOOK WAS MY FIRST TASTE OF THE EROTIC HISTORICAL ROMANCE NOVEL GENRE AND SINCE READING IT I CAN'T GET ENCOUGH! I REALLY WISH MS BERNARD WOULD WRITE MORE! I WAS ENTRALLED BY THE PLOT THE CHARACTERS THE SETTING AND OF COURSE THE SIZZLING LOVE SCENES THAT LEAPED OFF THE PAGES DRAWING ME IN! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!"
3,Keep it up Puffy!,"You all need recognize Puffy's talent as an entrepeneur, All of this Puffy hatin is brought on by jealousy and envy of those without the Bentley or iced out chains. ya'll sit around talkin' bad about Puffy and his riches but ya'll too lazy to get up and get it yourself, I'm 18, I started my first business when I was 15, through hard work and sacrifice ( i dropped out of college) I now have a 2000 Ram Truck and a 1990 Bentley Turbo T, yea, I bought it used, but it's still a bentley, I see the look in these haters eyes when I drive by, keep up Puffy , can't nobody stop you but yourself.Much Love!"
3,sobered abstinence,"this soundtrack feels so inspired, and i mean literally from Nina Rota's work from Fellini's film ""Amarcord"". Well mostly the sad string theme.the rest of it seems like a hodge podge of direct inspiration from other soundtracks that seemed very evocative from other movies. kind of like jon brion took the best from the best and did a cover album on his favorite compositions. I didn't see a lot of originality from the soundtrack, but that's not saying i wasn't thrilled to hear it.but i definately recommend looking at Nina Rota's music on the ""Amarcord"" soundtrack."
3,Decent blowing session,"I love PM and have most of his discs, and I absolutely relish almost any chance to hear him play straight jazz, but this is really just a decent blowing session. Pat spends a lot of time just noodling around... the riffs are mostly familiar. Nowhere near the mighty Trio Live or the well-thought-out, often moving Trio 99."
1,old seasoned master with a mediocre novice,"ok, ali akbar khan deserves appreciation, but his son really is mediocre.wonder why such a talented musician who has a wealth of knowledge has not been able to produce ONE worthy successor. (Nikhil Banerjee was already groomed by allaudin khan and annapurana devi before comming to ali)ive heard his son live several times and it sounds like a corpse is playing.....there just is no soul"
5,Just ordered a replacement because I like the deck so much!,"This is a great deck, drawn largely from the works of Thorsson and other contemporary but serious writers on the subject. The imagery is beautiful, stirring, and inspiring. The artist has clearly internalized the tradition and added a great deal of integration to the imagery that occurs in much of the contemporary literature. Yet the artist's voice is not lost either, and despite the fact that my own understanding often diverges from the artists, I have chosen to replace this deck.This is a worthy deck."
2,"Great music, only one cd.","Reason for my rating is the fact I only got one cd. I mean, 51 bucks for one cd is messed up. I guess I bought it after reading the reviews hoping the cd had like a bonus disc inside that they didn't put on the description... oh well. If you got the money and would like to own atleast ONE of the cd of this album, buy it."
4,This is GOOD music i really like it,"Well what to say this is a cool soundtrack ""Pushing The Sky"" and ""WHAT PLANET IS THIS"" are good. Also ""Diggin"" is cool but ""Gotta Knock a Little Harder"" is my favorite. If you like Cowboy Bebop it's a great companion to The Cowboy Bebop CD-Box good tunes, good tunes."
3,Hmmm...,"I hate to be rather negative in this review, since I live in Minneapolis and I love the Minnesota Orchestra, but this CD was not that great. Miss Sonnenberg plays this piece with an unusual amout of aggression. She seems to stab the piece to death, in fact! In the first MVT, this isn't much of a problem, but in MVT II, It's played with this feeling of anticipation, as though you can tell that she really wants to play much louder and much faster, unlike the tenderness of Hilary Hahn. The last MVT is, of course, a dramatic movements, but she plays it with a rythmic burden, with many notes held just a bit too long, and also without the upbeat livelyness of other performers. Instead of this CD, I recommend either Hilary Hahn's Recording w/ Sir neville Marriner and the Julliard Orchestra, or Anne-Sophie Mutter w/ The New York Philharmonic (1997)."
2,"Illogical phrasing, strange interpretations","This soloist offers strange interpretations with illogical phrasing and primitive understanding of the works. The not too great technique also doesn't help her. I would have been bored if I wasn't irritated with the sloppy sound production and phony spinning of anti-musical pseudo-lines. The market is already pretty saturated with dozens of highly accomplished recordings of these particular works, by truly great artists of the most sterling reputation. Why would anyone want to own or even preview these recordings, is beyond me. I can't possibly recommend them."
2,Not everyone will find it funny.,This film is a situation comedy based on laughing at people in awkward situations. If you have a taste for that kind of thing than this movie is for you. Otherwise forget it.
4,Great food ideas,"I oftentimes recommend this book to my patients that are at a loss for what they need/should be eating during treatment. It takes a lot of the guess work out of what to cook. A great gift for friends and family members who don't know what else to do when a loved one is diagnosed, buy this book and prepare a healthy meal.Extensive cancer treatments can be devastating to the entire system, so eating healthy foods can help to combat even the worst of chemical side effects.Well-written, easy to read, and chock full of info."
2,Be careful with this approach,"If you subscribe to the view that cancer diets should focus on low fat, low sugar, and food that maintains low blood glucose levels this is a book to avoid. Receipes frequently used all purpose flour, refined sugar, powdered sugar, white potatoes, and margarine. People who have read and accept the principles in ""What To Eat If You Have Cancer"" will find this cookbook difficult to use without careful receipe selection and ingredient substitution."
1,One more from the same,"As we say in Brazil: Those have tongue can talk everything and Paper ( eletronic or not ) accept anything...About this subject I don't have any doubt that not just we Brazilians but nortamerican Afro descendents too cannot agree with that interpretation of historyAnd I'll never get tired to say ...A very curious, adaptable and malleable thing is are History..."
3,Item Need,"Hi ,I am very intrested in buying some phones from you ,So do please get back to me as soon as possible with the details and get back to me with your last offer that you will sell for me so that i can know what to do.Looking forward hearing from youRegards"
1,Rotten experience with Cingular's customer service.,"Long story short, I called Cingular for the first time today and spent nearly an hour trying to get someone there to port in my old number. What a frustrating and rotten experience, including being given the wrong number to call, and then being told that it was the wrong number (by a rather rude representative) after being put on hold for a long time. After some more bad customer service, I finally got to a supervisor and told him that this was perhaps the worst ""customer service"" I'd ever experienced, and that this was my first and last day with Cingular. I can not imagine ever needing to call them down the road for something and going through this type of frustrating hassle again. I am going to send the phone back and order another one with ANOTHER CARRIER! Too frustrating."
1,DON'T Buy it!,"H.J Spivack's review (12/17/04) is dead-on! I have experienced the same issues and frustration with Cingular & this phone. My advice, get a different phone & service. Received the first phone in June 2004 and now in May 2005, I am on the fifth phone. Each time a problem has come up (buttons didn't work, display stops working, phone answered the call on its own (while sitting on the desktop), etc.), the service has been tremendously awful (1 hr on the phone) and my only viable option is to receive another refurbished phone. The company tells me the replacements are ""reconditioned"" and suggested I contact Motorolla. Even after clearly articulating I was dissatified with the quality of the phone and service, my request for a refund and/or different phone at their cost was denied. This company is not customer friendly or interested in maintaining any level of customer service or satisfaction. Add to that poor phone performance and it is a lose-lose scenario."
4,Great Little Phone,The Good:- excellent brightness and good color- Nifty speaker phone feature- Nice sized keys wih varying sizes make it easy to key numbers in without having to look- Good sound qualityThe Bad (ish)- The BlueTooth functions are a little difficult to find- the camera takes passable photos -- the color is okay - but it is a little on the blue-hued side- I gave up on synching data with my PC I too found the software unusableI am not pleased with Cingular. Terrible service.
3,Nice phone,"This phone got a lot improved from the previous model of V300. Compare to V300 plastic cover and low resoultion of color, this phone sure gives you more of each things. A unique design with the metal cover, the bluetooth supported, 64k color and you can go with actual MP3 ringtone on it! It sound a lot better than the way V300 sound. The reason I am not giving it five stars - because battary life doesn't last long, the phone is a little bit haveyer than what I have excepted, the phone somehow lagging bad when you call out and receive calls."
4,Parkening and Brandon Duo,"This duo plays very well; however, the best tracks of this CD are on the Parkening ""Great Recordings"" double CD. Thus buying that CD would get you the best of this CD plus a lot of other good recordings. The duo's performance of ""La Vida Breve,"" ""Intermezzo,"" and ""Evening Dance"" are my favorites (and are included on the ""Great Recordings"" CD)."
2,Kinda Lame,"I found this book in my mom's closet. It started out pretty good, but since it's one of those thin romance novels, it has to skip to the falling in love part too quick. It's like they met one day and were in love the next. There was no sex in the book which after starting to read it, was not surprised. If you like your books PG rated and full of fluff this is the book for you."
1,Worthless--Try the State Dept Website,"If I could figure out how to get my money back for this item, I would do it! A scam... There is more and better info at the State Dept. Website. Not worth 7 bucks!"
5,GREAT BOOK,THIS IS A BOOK EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE. IF JESUS HIMSELF CHOSE TO SHOW SOMEONE HELL WHO ARE YOU TO SAY HE DIDNT?THE DEVIL HIMSELF IS THE ONE KEEPING PEOPLE AWAY FROM THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT IS TRUE.
1,"Epic, just epic!","This must be, quite simply, the most epically stupid and hence also the most epically entertaining bunch of reviews in the history of Amazon. Which in itself is an epic achievement.The book too is epic in its utter stupidity, but there's no shortage of those around here and elsewhere. The real entertainment is in the demented reviews, so really - just read those and skip the book."
1,Crock,"Sorry folks, this is all a sad joke. Yes, Hell exists. Yes, unbelievers will instantly take up residency there upon their last breath here much like believers will Heaven upon their last breath. No, this man did not descend into Hell and ""pop"" back to life again. Save your money. God does NOT issue second chances! If this man was in Hell it's because he's STAYING there....which means, you wouldn't be hearing from him like this. Could he have imagined this, yes. The brain does all kinds of neat things on it's own. Christ descended into Hell and told us about it in the Bible. The parable of the rich man tells us about it. Christ spent more time talking about it and warning us about it then he did talking about any other topic! This man's book isn't/wasn't needed, nor is it in any way, shape or form valid. Period."
1,Only for the spiritually immature,"This guy may be well meaning, but if he thinks that the only reason to become Christian is to be spared Hell, then he is very spiritually immature. If he has so little faith that he thinks that scaring people is a motive that God would approve, then he has no true faith.I forgot Bill. Who is the father of all lies?"
3,23 MINUTES IN HELL,"I saw Bill Wiese on a television program discussing this book. It's truly an eye opener & gives you pause. I haven't finished it yet but from what I've read thus far I feel comfortable recommending this book to everyone. The descriptions in this book are so vivid it makes one @ the very least beg the question, what if this is genuinely a real experience? Hopefully you'll never have to find out! Now that I've finished this book I must admit that I'm a little disappointed. I wasn't expecting a lot of references that I already read for myself. I was expecting more descriptive content. Maybe I was looking for too much. I don't recommend this book unless you're not familiar with the Bible. If that's the case you'll probably get something fresh & new from it."
5,"This is a ""must read""","There is so much information in here about what hell is really like that is totally documented by Scripture. It is a ""must read"" by everyone, and certainly by anyone who has doubts about the fact that there truly is a ""hell."" I strongly recommend this book."
1,Good for a metaphor,"Not believeable for a real experience. I've read others that seem more honest. This was a good metaphysical explanation, if you want to look at it that way. Some people may find this helpful. The isolation and feelings of abandonment, loneliness and desperation etc. are no doubt real."
5,God-given Vision,"i believe Mr. Weise's experience to have been a God-given vision. To the cynics who say it was only a dream, I say, ""So what?"" God does give visions AND dreams to people in order to speak to or speak through them to suit His purpose. Thanks Mr. Wiese for sharing your experience."
2,real or fairy tale?,"SOME PROBLEMS WITH THIS STORY: 1) NO ONE BUT THE AUTHOR AND HIS WIFE WITNESSED THIS EXPERIENCE, THERE WAS NO NEAR DEATH OR EVEN COMA LIKE EVENT AND NO INDEPENDENT CORROBORATION 2) HE HAS NEVER SUBMITTED TO A LIE DETECTOR TEST AS TO WHETHER IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED 3) EVEN NDES (NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCERS) HAVE NEVER REPORTED SUCH AN EXTENDED PERIOD ON THE OTHER SIDE 4)HOW DOES THE AUTHOR KNOW IT WAS EXACTLY 23 MINUTES? 5) WHY DID HE SOON START A VERY PROFITABLE BOOK AND SPEAKING CAREER AND MINISTRY AFTER THIS EVENT?"
1,totally disgusted,cant beleive i had 2pay 4 this rubbish typical religious robber ppl again no doubt youll burn in hell weise
4,only one objection,"I thought the book and the author's purported experience to be helpful for many. I never want to put God in a box, so it's not for me to say how much of his testimony is genuine - it could well be. My objection is simply that Mr Wiese describes the residents of ""hell"" as more or less enjoying it there. Since this is a place of unending remorse for all beings consigned there, how does it become torture for humans and sadistic fun for the denizens? The latter are so un-tortured that they have time and energy to terrorize the humans!..."
5,Should be read by every Christian,"This book was very moving for me and increased my conviction that there is a God and there is Hell. I was so moved that I contacted my pastor and he is in the process now of presenting a set for sermons on Hell. Nobody wants to believe there is such a place of suffering for those who were lead astray, but there is. I have recommended it to everyone in my care group and I recommend it to you.Grace be with you."
1,what the hell???,If this piece of garbage doesn't make you feel ashamed of having wasted precious time reading this man's rant... nothing will. This man is seriously delusional.
5,23 minutes in hell,Twenty three minutes! Exactly! What brand of watch did this guy have? I want one.
1,Totally unbiblical,"It seems like Mr. Weise bought into pop culture portrayals of hell when fabricating his ""experience"". The hell he describes in his book is not the same hell that is described in the Bible. I also question why God would choose him to see hell in order to witness to the world, which undermines the absolute authority of the Bible as the final revelation. Either he had some sort of lucid dream or he is lying. Good intentions aside, I do not recommned this book."
4,A Christian's journey to Hell and back!,Anyone who thinks they are going to enjoy their friends with them in Hell are mistaken. There is no partying in Hell. It's unbearably hot...burning pain...screaming agony...prison cells...and DEMONS. This is no picnic! This is no laughing matter. This is what the author experienced. It changed his life!
5,Review on Bill Weiss Book,"I believe everything that Bill Weiss says in his book. I don't believe that he would just make this up to sell a book ?? I am a Roman Catholic and i believe that Hell is real and literal. God's warning to us comes through Bill Weiss's testimony. It is true that God said he would not send someone from the dead, if you have the prophets ?? But Bill Weiss was not from the dead, he was from the living and God uses many people as messengers to spread his word. Bill Weiss's book really set an impression on me, i have always believed in a "" literal hell "" and it is one place i would not want to visit ever !!Donna"
2,Twenty-Three MInutes in Hell,"I am not even sure I know where to begin with this book. I am a Christian, and I do believe in Hell. However, I really don't know if this author really described it or not. He was very convincing in his dissertation, and his description confirmed my view that I have no desire to visit the place. It was hard to read because it was very graphic. He made some very good points, but it is not a book that I would say was enjoyable. I don't think the author intended for readers to ""enjoy"" the book. All in all, it was a quick read, but I am not sure everyone would be able to finish it."
1,Read the TRUTH (the Bible) to know the TRUTH,"I urge you to read ""Ecclesiastes 9:4-6"". ""...The dead no nothing..."". Jesus said: ""No one can go to the father except through me..."" and in Revelations it tells us, at the Lord's coming, the dead will rise first and ascend into heaven, but not until the second coming of Christ. Therefore it is impossible to experience either heaven or hell before this time."
3,Not Scary Enough,"Wiese's trip to Hell was a life changing event that must be shared. However, the 23 Minutes in Hell were covered the fist third of the book. I was expecting more detailed descriptions of a place that I have no intention of visiting. However, Wiese did a good job of reminding Christians that we should share not only God's grace but what His grace is saving us from. Furthermore, the book offered readers hundreds of references in the text and appendix to further explore this disturbing topic. I wanted to be scared but instead I was reminded of my duty as a Christian; maybe this is one book that's better as a movie.[...]"
5,An Easy Way to Learn and Be Aware of Where You're Headed,"""23 Minutes in Hell"" is remarkably easy to read and gives such a detailed description that it's like he is taking us there with him to witness his experience. I read it aloud to my daughter and to my 7-yr old granddaughter who has been wanting to know the Truth. She slept soundly and peacefully that night to my daughter's surprise. The little one can't even watch Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory because of the things like a little girl swelling up like a big blueberry. I explained to my daughter that this one was in the spirit realm and anointed so people can understand it & get closer to God. I've been handing them out to people and plan to buy more."
3,Not So Satisfy,"The clipper haircutting function ok, but 2 of the combs (left ear taper and blending) were broken, and the cleaning brush didn't came."
1,The Worst Horror Film I Have Spent My Time On!,This Movie S**ks. The Plot S**ks. The Acting S**ks. The MusicS**ks. The Script S**ks. What else can I tell you? In this StupidHorror Film people go back to a high school where aparently a bunch of teens were murdered to film a movie. Features Stupid Action scenes (If you could call them action scenes) and lousy ending. The only thing that saves this movie from being the worst film of all time is that fact that George Clooney is in it. Dont waste your time on. Even if there is nothing else on!
2,"A (very) poor man's ""Scream""","Featuring George Clooney in an early role and Maureen McCormick (Marcia Marcia *Marcia* Brady) in a comeback role, of sorts. Also featuring a confusing metafictional plot, flat humor, and mostly bad acting. ""Return"" is yet another slasher-movie-about-slasher-movies. There were several of them made during the eighties, most of which now claim to have been the inspiration for ""Scream."" None of them were as good as that movie, however, and ""Return"" is no exception. Although the movie has its moments -- a scene of a cop creeping down a murky hallway whereabouts the killer may be lurking is tense -- there aren't enough of them to sustain the proceedings. If you watch just to see Clooney and McCormick, be forewarned that the former gets bumped off early (first, in fact), and despite a valiant effort McCormick's cop who gets turned on by all the carnage is a joke that just doesn't work."
2,A dull and disjointed disaster.,"Posing as a high school slasher THE RETURN TO HORROR HIGH is actually a poorly written, poorly acted and poorly directed horror/ comedy...and I'm using both of those terms loosely.Confusingly told with an incredible amount of flashbacks, a limp dream sequence and a twist ending that was so stupid it made THE VILLAGE look like Stephen Hawking the story is about a film crew shooting a slasher movie at a high school that was previously the scene of a real life massacre. People start disappearing, but not as quickly as my desire to care what happens.I have no idea what the filmmakers were going for, but they failed on every level possible. Sadly, I've seen worse, much worse, but still there is no reason (outside of morbid curiosity or drunkeness) to waste your time on this clunker.Gorehounds: don't worry about it; the limited special effects are pathetic, barely above Troma standards."
2,Nothing but a big hassle,"I ordered the boxwave screen protector for my Motorola Q. When I opened it to put it on, there were 2 problems.One corner of the film was folded. Not big enough to stop me from putting it on, but there none the less.The bigger problem was the films (one on each side) covering the screen protector were labeled backwards. I put it on my phone and it did not stick, but all kinds of stuff stuck to the outside. It was ruined.It took weeks of arguing before Boxwave finally gave me my money back. I bought a cheap knockoff for $2. It came in the exact same packaging! But it was labeled correctly! lol."
2,Kindlization didn't work for this book,"I have owned the hard-copy for decades; but wanted to review something while on vacation, so I downloaded it to my Kindle (after having read Peggs' review). I have a Kindle DX (white version) and concur with Peggs that tables are corrupted, symbols (such as the one for degrees) are replaced with a question mark, some graphics do indeed have black bars in them to the extent that they are useless. I am very disappointed; although perhaps I can get what I need from it (helped by a previous familiarity of the work). I do not recommend the Kindle version (sent to a DX anyway) if it is to be used for initial familiarization of navigation."
4,Love their parallel universe,"First disc is regular Church songs meant to be found on some dancefloor.Second disc is the parallel universe of their music. Something totally different! They are stepping in an other world and it's a beautiful one. My favorite track is ""Twin star"". Deliciously noisy at start but reached a beautiful guitar-harp sound in the middle part with magical lyrics ""she's got two tiny stars in her eyes ..."" and it becomes more noisy again and ends softly with that harp-guitar sound. Second favorite is ""1st woman on the moon"" I enjoy every seconds of that 11 minutes song, love that over-emphasis on the bass and the lovely percussion. Very sensual.Nice album."
3,Not too great,For the price this was okay but I really reccomend Majestic Chess. It was one of the most fun games I have ever played because of it's great adventure mode that makes chess much more fun. Championship Chess was just an average chess game to play against a computer and was no different than any other chess game I have ever played.
3,"If you fly fish, you wil enjoy it",Not a good reviewer for this as not an ardent fisherman. Easy and light hearted read by the fire when the fishing season is over. .
5,Baby Blue cat will warm your heart,"The Baby Blue cat who said NO is a simply illustrated book with lots of repetition for toddlers who seem to love it so.Baby Blue cat gives his mother a difficult time throughout the day by repeating the mantra of every two year old as an answer to every question posed to him. Mama cat is exasperated by the end of the day. My son asked for this book to be read almost every day when he was around two,somehow I never tired of it.Read this book to your toddler and you will see why."
2,I hoped more,"During my audiophile listening through different kind of music, this was the most desireed into my list. This was causes because of the several uses for several resellers and manufacturer of audiophiles electronic components on brazilian demonstration, meeting and open fairs. Those demonstration was intended to clearly show the sound stage of the voice, and also their respective positioning, air separating each voices and the differences of heigh between the singers. That was well recorded!However, I could not find this kind of magic in my listening room. I will give this album a second chance, when I visit one friend, but so far I am not want to listen it again."
1,X-out Song X,"What are you people thinking? Has the world gone mad? This is NOT jazz. I can play better than this and I don't even play saxaphone. Someone came up to me the other day and said ""Hey this is great stuff!"" When I told him that they weren't even playing music whatsoever, he said ""No way man, they are CHOOSING those notes!"" I slapped him in the face.I thought that the birth of Kenny G. as a jazz icon was the lowest point in jazz's history...I was wrong... Song X is rock bottom.What happens when a drummer, guitarist, and saxophonist all solo at once? Song X a.k.a. crap."
1,Microwave Fodder,"If you haven't seen the wonderful effects that happen when you put a CD in the microwave, this is the one to try it with."
1,Love It Or Hate It ... There Is No Middle Ground,"As with quite a few of the other Amazon reviews of this album, I'm a fan of much of Pat Metheny's work but not this particular project.I've tried several times to get into this record and failed dismally every time.It really is a ""Love It Or Hate It"" record. A friend of mine rates it as one of his all-time favourite albums ... I find it un-listenable.DEFINITELY hear it before you buy it!"
3,"Fun workout, can get ""old"" fast though","Gloria Quinlan has a lot of energy and does a good job leading this routine despite a few times when she miscues and some strange usage of the English language (which I find charming rather than annoying). The routine can have a pretty steep learning curve and give you a good workout while you're learning it. But I found that I outgrew the routine quickly. It is a fun one, but best for Beginners I think. However, anyone could use it as a warm up for a toning routine."
5,Great beginner workout video,"Very nice low impact video. If you like the Macarena, the music will make you want to start dancing! Too many upper body closeups of the instructors, though... ;-) obviously intended to keep the men glued to the screen, but I'd prefer more closeups of the STEPS!"
3,"Fun to read, decent pics","Its a pretty short read, and not sure its necessary when most people know the song and can sing it rather than read it from a book."
5,"Liked it so much he wore it out, now we're going to hard cvr","Our 21 month old LOVES this book. We have to take it everywhere. He can't get enough of it. He ""moves 'em on back"", ""beeps the horn"", ""shh, shh, shh"" all over the house. A must have!"
1,JUNK. Buyer beware.,"After spending an hour on the phone with my Compaq tech support, I wasn't able to get my laptop to view on my Sony 52"" flat screen TV. Reason: cable is junk. Doesn't work on the TV or on my desktop monitor.Knowing that the set up should be a no brainer, I didn't keep my original box or the receipt. And of course, the Amazon merchant that sold it to me won't take it back BECAUSE of that. BEFORE YOU BUY THIS you might want to read the merchant's return policy. It stinks. Buy from another merchant and don't use this Belkin. They should have taken this back with no questions asked."
4,Good value,I paid about 40% of the retail price by purchasing through Amazon as compared to Frys Electronics Store.
2,Serious disappointment,"Hoping to fill my tv screen 60 led, this cable didn't do it. I did discover that they make hd vga cables that do it. This one didn't. I got a new cable that works"
3,Expected better from respected Belkin.,"OK, does the job fine. Weak (damaged?) wire adjacent to one vga connector! Seems bent and squeezed, possible manufacturing flaw or processing mishandle..."
1,"Rip-Off --- Not a real Belkin cable, blurry image on screen, poor quality","I purchased this cable because I ""assumed"" it was made by Belkin, not to mention that the reviews seemed excellent. Hmmmmmmmm, the legitimacy of these reviews makes me wonder now!In any case, when I received the cable and hooked it up, my screen was all blurry. Having worked with Belkin products before, I thought to look for their trademark name on the cable. To my surprise, it was not there! Cables made by Belkin should have their name on it.I discussed this with Amazon and they stated that they would look into this. I hope they do as their customers deserve better than this!My advise, don't buy anything sold by Amazon's distributor ""MarginMart, Inc."" It's likely to be a poor quality knock-off of the real thing."
4,"Good, but maybe some connection errors","The cord came within the week with standard shipping. Very thick and durable-looking. The connection to my TV seems a little jumpy at times, with horizontal lines across the screen. However, this may just be data delay since this is a longer cord. Other than that, no problems - it works perfectly and was exactly what I was looking for. I use it with my 37 inch HDTV, and it is able to display at full 1080p definition."
2,#3 has died on me,Let me start by saying that I love this keyboard. When it is working! This keyboard has everything I need in a keyboard and it is very easy to set up. The internet short cut buttons are great and having the music controls are a big plus. My huge problem with this keyboard is that I purchased three of them and all three of them have died within six months. It usually starts with the occasional missed key and slowly leads to certain keys that rarely work and will end up with a third of your keyboard that will not work unless you pound the hell out of it. I am a very tech savvy person and have tried everything to get this thing to work and slowly but surely they all end up dying. I held off giving the bad review but know that I am looking to replace keyboard #3 I will definitely be looking elsewhere.
2,To complicated,Keyboard and mouse has way to many features to use. It gets to complicated when trying to do simple tasks.The mouse is FULL of various buttons which makes it confusing.
1,piece of junk,"Save your money and buy something else. I've only have this keyboard for 2 months and its totally acting weird. when I type something, it takes a few seconds before it goes in and it always lose connection. I already burned mine, so i hope you guys wont waste your money on this piece of junk!"
3,Pictorials are blah,"Playboy, August 2008 is 140 pages. The pictorials in this issue are lame at best. The Susie Feldman pictures are the best, but you only get four pages of her in the nude. Playboy's Olympic Hall of Fame is a rip off only three pictures of three different athletes. Amy Acuff and Katarina Witt are the only two fully nude and Amanda Beard is semi-nude and laying on her stomach so you don't get to see much. Playboy of the Month-Kayla Collin hardly shows any nudity with the exception of her fold out centerfold. Finally Ashley Harkleroad is a joke. The first half of her spread she is wearing a tank top and mini-skirt. Only toward the end does she appear semi-nude. The only thing this issue has going for it are the articles. The Strange Redemption of James Keene, The Playboy Forum-Fortress Washington, 20Q Selma Blair and Interview with Ben Stiller are great. If this is the Playboy of the future then I can see why sales are down. Playboy, August 2008 gets a C-."
4,Nick Cannon Presents: Wild 'N Out - Season One,"I loved this show when it was on and since leaving the states to serve a tour here in Germany, I went into a movie store here and saw that this was out. I rented it and the two discs of shows took only a couple of hours and the extras are not really that great. They are skits that nobody laugh at when they were taping so they cut them. I love this show but on dvd it is way to short and you will find out when you get the dvd."
2,Not a Kid Im 21,However this Uncensored DVD is Awful. If they labled it as season 1 i would give it 4.5 stars. BUt since they lable it uncensored yet censored half the show it makes it gay.
2,Wild n Out DVD: Incomplete,"I love the show, I've seen all the episodes, but when I saw that the 1st season was going to be released uncensored, I was waiting for the release date. I bought the DVD and still heard more bleeps than punch lines and the musical performances were cut out for no reason.Sister company Comedy Central: Dave Chepelle season's all have complete musical performances. (No copy right laws if that's what your thinking)Biggest disappointment: Can't return DVD's."
5,Great item and Seller,I'm very satisfied with the product that I purchased and the delivery and service of that product. I would highly recommend this seller.
4,Nice view from the other perspective,Hibbert does a good job collecting available sources from the British point of view. Thoroughly enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it.
3,"Good, but kind of hard to follow","This was excellent in detail, but very hard to follow. I kept losing track of who was who. I recommend it only for someone who is deeply interested in history, because of its abundance of details."
5,The best pirate adventure since trasure island,"This was one of the best pirate stories i have ever read. I think it is Avi's best book ever even better than Charolette Doyle. It is about Kevin, who is captured by a gang of pirates. The pirates kill his father and sister. He is locked in a room, but tames a pigeon to deliever messages. He carries on a conversation in this way with someone but he does not know who. The person is the most surprising part of the story. A great Book!"
3,Weak magnetic bond,"I bought this magnetic card/cribbage set for my Dad to use on the porch at his lake front home. I can blow the cards off of the playing surface with little more difficulty than a regular, non-magnetized deck. Also, the deck of cards came unsecured, just loose in the bag containing the board. None of them were bent or damaged but I think this was just luck. Would not recommend."
4,East Coast Style,"Sera and her team show us their unique fusion style in this instructional workout; those complaining it's not belly dance must not have read the description because it clearly states that it's a fusion style - not just ATS or traditional belly dance. Of the few instructional videos I currently own, this is my favorite. The warm up is excellent, and will have you ready to work out - the combinations are very basic looking, but not easy by any means. She fuses a fluid liquid electronica dance style with traditional movements for a wonderful core set of moves you can grow from to into your own interpretation of a fusion style. The music is okay, a little dull for me but not bad. I enjoyed the performance piece even though the background wasn't terribly engaging but that wasn't the focus so I'm pleased overall."
3,"Pretty good work out, pretty good choreography, nothing special though.","Nothing to write home about, but I was pleased with the video. The splash screen/menu is organized but not very interesting. The drills, yoga-inspired stretches and the choreography aren't revolutionary, but I'd say it's a very good beginner/introductory piece. I don't have any other bellydance videos, but have taken bellydancing classes before, so I'm hesitant to outright recommend it."
4,Great DVD but NOT for Beginners,"I've been dancing for almost 3 years now, and I found this DVD to be refreshing! Sera introduced some new moves(to me, my background is Egyptian), and new concepts of thinking about some old moves. I really enjoyed the DVD, it had me sweating!That being said, the title has the word ""Basics"" in it...This part couldn't really be farther from the truth. I would definitely not reccomend this DVD for beginner bellydancers. She busts into a lot of moves without any explanation, and this would confuse very new people.However, a beginner dancer with 6 months to a year of instruction would find this as a very challenging but fun DVD.Sera gets 5 stars for noting those watching to be in the correct dance posture many times throughout the videos. Major Kudos for that! So many Dvds do not talk about dance posture!Hope this is helpful!"
1,"Modern dance or club dance, but not belly dance, not tribal","I wish I could return it.This may be fine for modern dance, but for anyone looking for belly dance, look elsewhere. I have an open mind about dance, and I know belly dance takes many forms. She does incorporate some belly dance moves, but that is not the dance form she teaches.I strongly suggest you do a video search on this video before you buy it. The clips from her dance at the end will quickly tell you if this is a video you want. I wish I had checked!Also watch out, as several of the warm ups and moves can be harmful to the knees, neck, and/or spine (knees especially!)"
1,Really disapointing,"I was really hoping for something different, interesting, and a bit more on the side of Tribal Belly Dance.What this is, is Tribal heavily mixed with hip hop. I found it to be an unattractive combination.What's worse is the instruction was poor, especially for beginners.I suppose if your just looking for a work-out this would be fine but, not for Tribal Style instruction."
2,Not accurate,"I tried all the strips in the kit. The results did not correspond to a more elaborate test I did afterwards to confirm the rather questionable results from this kit. If someone is serious about testing his well water, I would not recommend this kit."
2,Watch out for old test packages,"I purchased this in Home Depot to verify iron levels in my well which I knew were high, but not how high. The tests came out as zero. I called the company and they sent me another set of strips to try. They said if this item is stored in a hot area (such as a warehouse) it can lose integrity. That was nice, but the 2nd strips still read around .1ppm. The kit I have is not like any of the covers now selling on-line - mine has a solid blue cover with no people on it - old?. I bought a Hach iron test kit and the reading was around 1ppm - a big difference. I've had the 1ppm verified so the Pro-lab test is not for someone who is trying to determine healthy levels for their household water. If you're going to test on a regular basis, splurge for a more expensive kit to give you peace of mind."
2,Disappointment,"I read a review on this book here and it sounded good. When I received the book and began reading I couldn't get far, for it seemed to me like another formulaic approach to mental health and formulas don't work. Each individual must discover what s/he needs to let go of that is interfering with healthy, balanced living. In spite of the training workshops this book has spawned I find it of limited usefulness."
1,Disappointing - clearly not for beginners,"Despite many reviews recommendation this book for beginners, it has nothing for the beginners. It is clearly for people who have prior knowledge. Does not explain any basics.Do not install CD. Despite my mentioning a particular folder in which to install the software, the CD went ahead and created a new folder called PROGRAM. And this conflicted with the WIndows startup at next boot - which gave me a message that this folder has to be renamed to anything but PROGRAM.In any case, the software did not run.But a big disappointment, when I went by the reviews."
4,Insiteful,This book was exteremely well written. It is a very thought provoking book and a must read for all politicians as well as voters
2,review,The product was shipped fast but the portion that plugs into the wall was cheaply made and broke quickly. The cord and the car charger still seem to work
5,Works Great,Don't be nervous about buying this... it works great. I lost the sync cable and car adapter so I'm buying another
1,did not work,"This product was cheap to buy... probably because it does not work!! neither cord worked, the red light did not come on the first time i plugged it in."
1,Piece of Junk,"The first shipment came to me completely destroyed - specifically it had been crushed into about a dozen pieces due to crappy packaging. The company said they would send me a replacement at no additional cost. They did. However, the item stopped working after 2 days of use. Just look at the price - this thing is cheap for a reason......because it is junk. My advice: Spend some money and get a quality AC adapter."
1,where is it?,I cannot review what I never recieved even if I was charged for it. This vendor is a crook!
3,"Great solos, Mediocre amalgamation","This album has the star presence of Pavarotti and Ramey. This is quite evident, as the male solos are really great. However, I wasn't feeling Dies Irae and some of the other tracks as much as I was in other recordings. It felt rushed and less powerful.This is a good album, but, I'd only recommend it for comparison to the other recordings. Score yourself the Vienna or Chicago recordings before listening to this."
4,"If Mack the Knife is all you know, you're really missing out","Truly this is Weill's masterpiece, and perhaps one of Bert Brecht's best, too. If a drunk Ferruchio Busoni wrote Dixieland jazz, this probably would be the result. I also have the Capriccio CD, and despite it's superior fidelity, the performances don't compare. (Except for the restoration of the ""bordello-scene""; omitted in this recording.) In the Capriccio CD, the singing is pompous, more befitting an inflated ""Rienzi""; in this vintage recording, the performance is probably closer to Weill's conception. Doors freaks will enjoy the ""Alabama-Song""; while political historians will notice a clever foreshadowing of the maniacal reign of Hitler. This is the quintissential Weill--forget Dreigroschenoper! The omitted star is for mono sound, but one hardly notices the limitation."
4,Just Wacky Enough To Be Onto Something,"A well-written, amusing and very entertaining book. There is just enough substance to some of the tales related within to make the serious student do a real ""double take"", and investigate further. On the other hand, Mr. Gilbey seems to have had his tongue firmly planted in his cheek on a few occasions. A train station in Iceland? If you don't get that one, you need to be studying a lot more than just martial arts."
3,MOSTLY FACTS......SOME FICTION,"I originally read this book some 10 years ago. I found it interesting because an art that I began practicing in Korea in 1983 was ""Profiled"" in the book. I was never really sure of the precise heritage of my art, but Mr.Gilbey`s seems correct. But, with years, I found some of his information to be fictitious.A story that comes to mind is in the final section where he claims a man left a fist impression in a steel stancion! Please....! My original copy of this book was from the 1960`s -the author probably never assumed the world would grow so knoledgeable! Overall a good book."
5,One of Hartnell's Best!,"The Daleks' MasterPlan is an exciting yet long 12 part adventure. Similar to the Keys of Marinus and the Chase, Terry Nation, who wrote most of the story, was able to create another great story where the Doctor and his companions must leave one dangerous place for another in each unfolding episode of the Daleks' MasterPlan."
3,Decent book at an affordable price,I have used this book in the Advanced Inorganic Chemistry course I tought.This book has the best explained chapter on Molecular Orbital Theory that I have seen so far in inorganic chem. textbooks. It does a good job as an introduction to solid state chemistry too. And fair to most other subjects.However the treatment of Symmetry is minimal (has been reduced to a couple of pages in an appendix) which is a serious deficiency. Thus I have had to complement this text with Alan Vincent's excellent symmetry modules. Since McKay's book is inexpensive this complementation worksvery well.
5,A Book I'd want to re-read,"I read this in hardcover, and it's amazing. Jones is the only fiction writer I know of now who is truly driven to poetry, that is necessary poetry, not vague lyricism. Every line matters. I live in Saint Louis, MO, and Jones is here at a university to be a visiting writer and just gave a reading of his newest work, about Alaska in 1970, and it heads off in a totally different direction. There's no one writng today with his sincerity and poetry."
1,Doesn't work.,"When I first received the splitter, I briefly tried it with my Apple Cinema Display with the MacBook Pro, It worked. I recently bought a ViewSonic display to see how well it work with the splitter. It didn't work at all, although directly connecting the ViewSonic cable worked. Not only that, it no longer worked with just the Cinema display. Nada, nothing. The computer detects the displays, but neither will display a raster scan when connected through the splitter, whether individually or in combination. Each works when individually connected directly. So this item is a loser. Guess I'm the loser. :-("
5,Works perfectly.,"Works perfectly for our applications (a professional studio environment). Good design/construction, built to last. I would recommend this product (though you must have a suitable video card)."
3,dead world...ok for true fans,"""dead world"" is a fairly decent ep..it only consists of 2 new songs though...i only really like track #2 though. the live songs are alright... i does really give you a sense of what shadows fall sounds like live... the sound quality on this album for the first 2 tracks are simply awsome when compared to the band's previous albums... it's worth buying if you are truly a shadows fall fan...not a newbie.i got this cd form my girlfriend who is currently living in japan...she sent to me by mail in october of 2001... i was happy :)"
3,not as pictured,"I was greatly disappointed in this outfit when I took it out of the box. the sleeves and belt area where the photo shows black(webs) on black is actually black(webs) on orange! I would have sent it back that day, but it was for my 8 year old for Halloween. She didn't care, and liked the outfit just fine. I gave it 3 stars because she is happy, and it does fit well, and is made well (for the price). I do wish Amazon would be better about making sure the picture matches the item."
4,4.1354 stars,"Kennedy rocked the Atari Lounge at the Casbah.They played a song announced as:""You locked my sexuality up in a closet for four years but now I'm free and it feels bitchin""They also covered Jumpin Jack Flash. I was, coincidentally, at a Rolling Stones concert the previous night, and they closed the show with a way overblown version of that very song. I honestly preferred Kennedy's gritty version; it was much more visceral and immediate and rockin.This album is twisted blues.It is inspired. It feels genuine.You will want to listen to it a second time."
5,The best Attila in the marketplace,"The standouts in this extraordinary studio recording are the fine Odabella of soprano Cheryl Studer, caught in the prime of her youth and the Ezio of Giorgio Zancanaro. Well, at the scrupulous conducting of Maestro Muti. I wish they had hired someone other than Shicoff as Foresto but you can't always have it all. Ramey is fine in the title role if a bit hammy for my taste. Still, this audio recording is worthy of 9 (out of 10) stars. And, if I could, I would give 10 to the live video version with the same forces save for the Foresto, thankfuly given to tenor Kaludi Kaludov. Do not miss this!"
1,No laughs here,I wish that I was able to view some of the pages before I ordered this book. I expected a series of humerous stories that could be used from the pulpit. It certainly wasn't full of humor and it definitely wasn't a treasure. I'm sorry that I wasted my money.
4,A Rasin in the Sun,"The story ""A Raisin in the Sun"" by Lorraine Hansberry was interesting and very easy to read. I liked the way they wrote the book as a play, that helped me get pictures of the characters and what they were doing. This book is showing the hard times many families have to go through and how they got through them by talking to one another. Many people can relate to this book because of financial problems or just trying to fit in."
4,A great book,"See at first I truly thought that this was simply another boring book, you know the kind that you get tired of reading. But as I began to read it I realized it was more of a play. The ply is based on real world situations and I as a teenager do und it to be very good and somewhat outstanding.To those who enjoy role play or acting this is the book for you nd believe me it was worth the money. The characters were believable and once you pick up the book you simply do not want to put it down.......well what are you waiting for. Read it!"
3,Realism at work,"I found that this play was somewhat easy to read but definitely fits into the realism genre which I'm not really into so much. The story in mainly one about race relations but also has a large amount of insight on family dynamics. If someone is particularly interested in either topic they may very well enjoy this play much more than I did. The writing itself and character building was excellent, I just wasn't much for the topic."
5,Fantastic!,"Such a wonderful and charismatic play! It pulls you into its interesting story line from the beginning, and takes you on a wonderful adventure full of fun and laughter. Although the plot and theme are more mature than other plays, it was a joy to read."
3,A raisin in the sun review,"This play does capture the African American History in America after World War II, however the characters are a bit extreme. The story ends in a bit of a tangent with Walters character completely changing. There should have been more to it. The character went from a money hungry poor black man who has no respect towards others, to a completely changed respectable smart caring and loving man, back to a money throbbing individual, back to a respectable loving character. That just made no sense to me."
3,"Knife is great, multi-tool is a little lacking","The knife is good, sharp, light, small and well designed. Overall, a very good knife for what it is, and what it cost.However, the multi-tool (I assume it's called ""Clutch"") is a little weak. While most of the tools, tweezers, Phillips and flathead (normal and micro) screwdrivers, nail file, etc. are good; the pliers feel very flimsy. When using them to bend almost anything, they start to twist, I have not broken them yet, but I know I will eventually. I believe the weakness comes from the spring loaded mechanism which keeps the pliers open, but I'm not sure.Additionally, it would have been more useful for them to include a serrated saw-like blade on the Clutch rather than a straight blade"
1,A Novelty Item At Best,A cute product and nice as something for your key chain assuming you don't get on a plane. It's not really a useful utility tool.
4,Great buy for the price.,"You can't beat the price and free shipping on amazon. I looked...I really enjoy the sound quality in this system. The subwoofer is fantastic, no distortion with excellent tone at all volume levels. I would wish the speakers were a little beefier, they start to lose sound quality near the 52+ volume range, but that would probably be solved by switching to a 14 guage or better wire, as they only come with 20 guage.Overall it is an excellent sounding system and my recommendation for anyone looking in the $300-400 range."
4,Pretty Good,"I bought this about a year ago, and I loved it. Then I started to realize some things about it. The sound quality from regular TV isnt great, I have to turn the volume way up to hear it. I use all HDMI and optic cables so everything is High Def, but the sound just doesnt sound great when in DBS mode. Also, I am pretty upset that my ipod wont connect to it, but a cheapo mp3 player will. I was under the impression that JVC was high quality but you would think something high quality would be compatible with other high quality things. I gave it a 4 because for a 100$ home theater system, it works. The dvd clarity is amazing and the sound on dvd is teriffic. I am thinking about upgrading to a blu-ray home theater but until then this will have to work."
5,A Spiritual Feast!,"John Pontius offers an indepth study of what practices good Latter Day Saints should be incorporating into their lives. He uses scriptural references to support his view with acumen and clarity. In my mind, it is a must read for all members of the LDS church.All I can say is, ""Well done."""
2,USeless book,"Nothing new here, except the fact that, in the writer's opinion, Butcher Harris was a great guy, just trying to make the war end faster... What a nice fellow Harris was...One thing was to believe that destroying german cities and killing their civilians by the thousands was a good way to shorten the war and, doing so, spare the lives of thousands of Allied men. Another completely different thing is TO ENJOY doing it, as Harris apparently did!"
3,decent book,"The wildly different reviews of this book I suspect reflect politcs not judgement. As usual with books on subjects like this one.This is a pretty straightforward account of the ""bomber dream"" as practiced against the third reich. It rarely strays beyond that scope. It is a useful corrective to the bombers-were-useless nonsense and a readable narrative."
3,"Good story, poorly edited.","The story was very good and engrossing. It is well written. The author starts out with a thesis and sets out to support it. It is shocking how many men went to their deaths daily in the bomber war over Europe. Given the very close accounting kept of current skirmishes, I think it would have been truely appalling, though informative, if everyone knew exactly how many people were being killed every day during World War II.However, I do find the book to be very repetitive and I have never seen a professionally published book with more typographical errors than this one. Editing and proofreading were lacking."
2,very dissapointing,"very ndissapointed, perhaps just too old a movie for present tastes and sophistication ( I have over 20 lighter than air hours. Much prefer the movie Zeppalin Jon."
3,"Good Book, Slightly Misleading Title","This book is subtitled ""The complete guide to attracting, identifying, and understanding your feeder birds."" While it is good at the ""identifying"" and ""understanding"" parts, it leaves something to be desired in the ""attracting"" department. I had hoped for a book that would tell me what has a good chance of drawing specific birds, but except for hummingbirds, it really doesn't go into detail about the topic. It's still a good book as far as it goes; I simply don't think that it's much of a guide to attracting the specific birds you have reason to believe are in your area, but goes with a considerably more general approach."
1,Tragedy,"This show had so much promise. Sure some of the characters were dreadful in dialogue. Yes, you could tell things were off to a slow start. But when the V first hit Earth it's all very exciting. Then the show was thrown into a pile of trash, and is generally not worth watching. I recommend watching the series until the V introduce themselves on the giant undership screens, then hit your foot with a hammer, and save yourself the time of watching anything further."
2,Slow and Lack Content,"I've watched every episodes but the show still has not got to the point. The old 80's one is about WWII Nazi invasion. District 9 is about an actual event in Africa. Independent Day is about unity. The old Star Trek is about Plato and Shakespeare. The new Star Trek is about Freud and Young. (I am just making this up.) This is 2010. What is this new V? It seems to me that the writers haven't figured out what story they want to tell yet. The entire season one is like a Beta version. Nothing is set. I feel like they want to try out what rating they can get from this brand before ABC can give them a ok to go all out. So far, I feel like they want to call their book ""V"" but they haven't come up with a thesis of this book yet.So, the CG is very very good but season one doesn't have any meat IMO.I hope season two start to pick up some pace."
2,Same old script different gendre ; (,Unfortunately right off the bat this seems obviously to be a major primetime network series with all the typical Politically correct cliches. They have been thrown in from your poor crime drama 101 school. Jeez doesnt anyone have a new idea anymore!? I actually feel kind of bad because 2 of the actors from the movie SERENITY (a very good and fairly fresh Sci-Fi movie) Morena Baccarin and Alan Tudyk are in it so I had some hope for it. They are the only reason why I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1.The original was very good for a TV miniseries but this is just bad... cheaply and brainlessly created. If you are a true Sci-Fi fan avoid this and just rewatch the original. However ... If you like CSI and other conveniently sculpted weekly crime dramas this may be your cup of tea.
2,Another good guys vs bad guys show--unrelievedly,"Unfortunately, this show is going in the direction of most of the other fare on tv. It is shaping up to be the evil aliens (who really look awful instead of beautiful) against the good guys (FBI agent, priest, etc., as rebels). The entire show this time advanced that premise rather than developing other aspects. I wish the aliens weren't so unrelievedly beautiful on the surface and evil underneath too. It doesn't leave much room for interesting stories other than good guys vs. bad guys. The only thing I enjoyed this time was looking at the beautiful alien Anna and the neat way she could try on outfits virtually. I doubt I will watch this next week. I think I will stick with FlashForward and Fringe as my sci fi of choice this season. Save your money."
3,"Plodding and vague, but overall OK.","This book was recommended to me by a friend. I began reading anxiously, hoping to get a peek into the world of girl gangsters. I was disappointed, for Gini Sikes' style was more like a he-said-she-said description of teen gangs. The writing was often confusing and vague, leaving much to be described about the situations the author encountered. There were way too many interviews and jumps without warning, leaving you to believe that Shygirl's testimony was actually made by Sadgirl, or whoever. Had it been a bit less rushed and hurried, and been edited a little more, this book would have been much better."
1,Save your money,There is nothing insightful in this book.Gini Sikes basically tells the stories of a few women who made bad choices and then blamed everyone but themselves for the outcomes of those choices.The book bogs down only a quarter of the way through it and never recovers.It is monotonous and tough to get to the end.I would probably rather listen to a scratched Wham CD or eat a huge bowl of brussel sprouts than have to read this again.Save your money.
2,were they pulling her leg?,"First and foremost,the chick on the cover looks like Divine in ""Desparate Living"". Second, I never felt like Gini Sikes got a real feel for her topic - she reminded the reader repeatedly of her strong education and solid middle class upbringing, and i always got the sense that these 8 ball chicks and the male gang members were trying to impress her with their badness, and were exaggerating their stories incredibly. Sikes never seemed to know what was truth and what was hyperbole. with a topic like this, you at lest have to have a pretty good idea. Her bad girls were not clearly and vividly drawn, and her bad boys were down right one dimensional.The lack of realism was astonishing. Very, very disappointing."
4,"Fattt Beats, Smooth Vibe, Quite Literate","I'm officially on the train. I can't get this damn thing out of my mind. I wish I had it this together when I was 20.The man's vocal talents are obvious; he can swing, sing, rap, and flow with considerable ease. What matters at the end of the day, of course, are the songs. On this score, CD gets an 8.5 out of 10 in my book.Craig David already gets Kudos for simply being intelligent enough to recognize that good songwriting is the foundation of the house; his efforts in developing his skills in this area are quite manifest, and it is a beautiful thing to see somebody hungrily training and developing his talent.Then it becomes a matter of execution. The production team on this effort has done a terrific job.The best debut in years, and certainly the best R&B debut since Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite."
2,Fill me in....I was disappointed,"I got this CD used, so its not like it was a big loss anyway. I was really a fan of ""Fill Me In"" when it came out. I thought the sound was interesting, here is a gorgeous guy who can sing for sure but the rest of the album fell flat on its face. I thought all the songs sounded exactly the same, there was no diverseness in the lyrics, and overall, kind of a snore fest. I ripped a few songs that I liked on to my computer to use to play in a shuffle with other stuff and then I resold it, but listening to this album front to back just isn't happening and it's certainly not worth keeping in my collection. It's far too ""slow jam"" style for me, which I do not like in the slightest."
5,everything I needed,"This album blends elements of RnB, Hip-hop, Pop, and Neo-soul over a spanish guitar to create the total package. When it was released in the US in 2001 it was at a time when urban/pop music was stale and everyone was trying to be an RnB Thug. This is one of those albums you can play all the way through, the songs flow together so well that its almost a concept album. Tales of young love, heartbreak, good times, romance,and moments of mature reflection abound. I didn't expect to like the songs Booty Man because of the title but Craig David can make anything he sings over an acoustic guitar sound lush and romantic, even if its the the exploits of a guy at a club. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT. 4 years later I can still play this album and smile. Future classics include You Know What, Walking Away, Fill Me In, 7 days, Rendezvous, and Bootyman."
3,GOOD BUT BASICALLY A MORE SOPHISCATED USHER,"Craig David...Craig David...Craig David.You couldn't live in2001 without hearing a million things about him.""He's so talented"".""He's so cute"".""He's groundbreaking"".When I first ""Fill Me In"" in mid-2000,I liked what I heardbut I wasn't sure,was Craig David just a soulful Robbie Williamsor was he going to be the first major UK-soul artist in theUSA in years?Fourtnaly,he turned out to be the latter.A superstar onthe UK two-step scene(a energetic mix of hip hop,R&B,pop,andUK dance music),David does have a fresh soul sound.Check out ""Fill Me In""'s chrous to see the house music flavor orthe mid-tempo ""7 Days"" for proof.""Booty Man"" and the album'sbest track,the UK megahit ""Walking Away"",are also winners.But I can't help to be honest,Craig David was sort of overrated.Though he's more sophiscated,class-y,and maturethan the American R&B stars,he ivokes a more elegant Usher.But ""Born to Do It"" is still a good album from a very promisingtalent."
3,I'll fill you in on this disappointing CD...,"When I first heard the handsome British two-step singer Craig David's first American single ""Fill Me In,"" I loved it. The lyrics were mischievious and the tune was so melodic and catchy. But when I heard ""7 Days,"" an r&b song enhanced by acoustic guitar and story-telling lyrics, I was convinced to buy the album ""Born to Do It."" After giving it a good listen, the only songs I honestly like besides the first two singles are ""Walking Away,"" ""Key to My Heart,"" ""Booty Man,"" ""Fill Me In Part 2,"" and the final (and best) track featuring the Artful Dodger ""Rewind."" I don't know why they call this track two-step because save for the last track, it's pure r&b with an acoustic twist. The subject material gets a little tired, too. Every song is about a rendezvous with a beautiful lady, or sex. It just gets old after awhile. Sorry, but Craig needs to go back into the studio and mix things up a little."
1,Born To Do It,I ordered this item almost a month ago and I have not received it yet. I am very disappointed that I have paid for this item and have not gotten it. I will not buy from this seller again because it should not be taking this long to receive this product. I am very dissatisfied.
2,Born To Do What???,"First of all, this album (. . .), 2nd of all, he can barely sing, The song ""Fill Me In"" is OK, but all the rest is totally Awful. I was looking forward to this album, because of ""Fill Me In""|and ""7 Days"", But I wasn't looking forward to much...I returned this (. . .), and got Usher's latest ""8701"" which is great! I reccomend that one fo' sho!!!"
1,dont waste your money,this album is waaay too overproduced and his vocals are terrible. he truly has no talent
3,sucky except cry me a river,"well i admit first time i got this album from my cousin I loved it. then I put it away for a long while (2 years) and then just last week got it out and listened to it again. i was so disapointed, this cd doesn't have much replay value. some of the songs are okay and pretty smooth but jt does sound like michael jackson, and not in a good way. i think Jc's album is much better than this one."
1,Even one star is being kind,"Justified is in plain and simple terms the worst album in recording history.Justin is the worst of the worst and is much more worse tan Britney,chris brown and the likes.Avoid at all costs.Get Born in the USA from Bruce Springsteen instead."
1,Popularity baffles me,"This is not a good CD. This doesn't even deserve to be next to a good CD on the shelf. This is pure, unfiltered white bread, ""hip"" music with all the edges smoothed. Justin has been proclaimed ""the next Michael Jackson"". I'd say he's more likely to be ""the next Tony Orlando"" - if he's lucky. Buy an Aaron Carter CD if you want the real deal."
2,Get ready to chuckle,"Wow, this has got to be one of the most innovative albums of all time. Seriously, all pop music is great, but this just takes the cake. Justin Timberlake obviously doesn't give a you-know-what about selling records, he just cares about making great music. The lyrics on here are totally original and obviously heartfelt. It must have taken the people who wrote them years. I also can't belive how hard Justin is. I'm pretty sure he grew up in Compton or something, because he is just one tough dude. What I wouldn't give to be as ""pimpin'"" as he is. In conclusion, if you're in the mood for something innovative and fresh, buy this. Don't buy it if you're looking for pop though, because this is just pure R&B! *Laughs hysterically at the people who took this review seriously*"
1,zero more like it,"Give me a freakin' break - this album sucks. Justin is so desperate for attention it's pathetic. His whiny vocals are irritating and don't get me started on the lyrics. Justin needs to get over Britney Spears, hire a GOOD writer and take some singing lessons because he SUCKS. This guy needs to quit his music career. And what's with him thinking he's black? Give it a rest, buddy - nobody but you thinks it's ""cool"". People that are the same race are annoyed, blacks are pissed off and other races are just laughing at you. Thanks for making us the laughing stock you immature punk."
1,this guy/woman is helpless,"why would he try to copy a genius like michael jackson? give me a break. this guy is helpless and clueless, and the people who buy this album have the same size of a brain this guy has."
2,Talent UNjustified.,"I don't understand why Justin Timberlake is hyped up so much. There are a few good songs on here, but nothing that really captures my attention. Senorita has to be one of the stupidest songs I've ever heard. Justin got a big head after his N'Sync departure. His talent was showcased much better back then, although Justin insists that he's so much better off without the rest of the guys and his material is 10 times better. Sorry Justin, but this doesn't cut it. There is no way that Justin could be the next 'king of pop'. He's not even close to deserving that title and to put him in the same classification as Michael Jackson would be absolutely ridiculous."
3,HE HAS CHANGED,"Now i have not bought this cd but i have listened to it and it is pretty good. Im glad he quit doing that Nsync music. He has finally changed and realized that that boy band music sounds the same and gets old after a while and has changed his style to rap. He did a good job having the Neptunes and Timabland producing most of his songs because their beats are off the hook. ""(Oh no) what you got"" is the tightest song on the cd i think. Now most of his songs arent really hip hop style some are slow love songs. So if you are into hip hop kinda style music this cd is for u."
2,a mixed bag,"Justin Timberlake's first solo album is, I have to say, a bit of a dissapointment. There is a few great tracks on this album but they are outwayed by the series of bland and sometimes annoying songs that make up the majority. The tracks that were released as singles, 'Like I love you', 'Cry me a River', and 'Rock your Body' are by far the best on the album, 'Rock your Body' actually being one of the best songs released by any artist in the past months, but unfortunity these tracks are the only highlights on the album. The exception to this is 'Take me Now', a collaberation with superstar Janet Jackson , which is a break from the HUm-Drum of most of the albums non released tracks.Overall, I would have to tell Justin to stick to his boy band day job."
4,Cry Me a Superstar!,"I must say I'm not a Justin Timberlake fan at all, in fact I dislike most ""pop"" music, such as Britney, Christina, Nsync, BSB, you get the idea- but I heard ""Cry Me a River"" on the radio one day and I can't get it out of my head! I like it a lot and I myself am actually tempted to buy this CD- just cuz of what a great song it is! This song will make a superstar out of Justin for sure!!!"
1,"""Justified"" is NOT worth your money!!","I really liked Justin's single ""Like I Love You"" after I saw the music video for it on TV. I thought his ""new sound"" was kinda cool. So when his new CD ""Justified"" came out, I went out and bought it. Big mistake. It totally [is bad]. It was a total waste of money to purchase that CD. I think that Justin needs to stick with 'N Sync and ""pop"" music. It's what he's good at. Hip Hop is just not his thing."
2,He's lucky he's good-looking...,"because this album is a piece of garbage. It has one or two memorable parts but for all the waiting, work, and hype, this album promised all & delivered nothing. It's like ordering a pizza and getting raw dough."
2,Bit too raunchy for preteens in my opinion,"While I felt this debut album was OK for my 41-year-old self, I'd be very hesitant to let my 10-year-old listen to someone singing about getting ""nekkid"" by the end of the dance."
5,I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THIS....,This album is amazing! I am not a pop fan and I have to tell you I was so surprised when I first heard this album! It is absolutely amazing! There is not a single song you have to skip. I reccomend this album to anyone who is open to a new sound! Justified is going to be a huge success!
2,"Thanks, but no thanks","Overall the songs and the production are not bad, almost any other male singer could make these songs decent. His voice is high pitched and doesn't work well with Urban contemporary music. His is best suited to well-crafted Dance-Pop music. I strongly suggest you listen to samples from the CD, as to avoid dissappointment.(...) I hope my short review was helpful to you."
2,Piece of Crap,I love how this album has gone up on Amazon's sales ranking since the superbowl controversy. Way to go people. Buy an album from an idiot seeking publicity.
2,PLEASE TELL JUSTIN HE IS CAUCASIAN,"I am probably the only person who thinks this cd is a waste of time and money. Imagine it, the only songs I liked on it are the ones the were singles and videos. I read somewhere that most of these songs were written for Michael Jackson. That sounds about right, his last album sucked too. Also, has anybody seen the video for ""I'm loving it""? Isn't it basicallly a rip-off of the video for ""The Way You Make Me Feel"" by Jackson?? I'll give Justin his props though, he can dance and is cute but pleeeease go back to N'Sync!!!"
2,Justified Leaves Us Unsatisfied,"Well, if you are looking for *NSYNC-esque dance hits, that ""dirty pop,"" or songs written by Max Martin, don't waste your money. This is a very grown up Justin talking about grown up things. This album is definitely not for anyone under the age of 16. ""Justified"" is full of very weak vocals, and songs about Britney... I mean not so glamerous songs about Britney. There are a few tracks that are good to listen to. But if you want to stare off into space, than this is perfect for you!"
4,I can't belive his voice,"OK the only songs worth hearing are Cry Me A River, Senorita, and Rock Your Body. I swear in the rest of the songs he sings like a girl, and worse, he sings R&B now. It was cool but his voice and the music just killed some of his songs though some are good. Well that's it."
1,One for the bin,"Avoid this one. Total crap. If I could give it zero stars, then I would have done. My wife bought it when it came out. I hated it, she loved it ..... for about a month. Now she hates it too. I think she only put out with the crappy tracks, so that she could hear the 2 biggest singles. Anyway, pretty soon afterwards she only played the 2 songs she liked. Now she doesn't play the cd at all ...... unless it's to drive me out of the house to do yard work. This cd is total, total garbage and doesn't even match the standard of the worst N'sync cd. Buy it for your worst enemy, or don't buy it at all. You have been warned."
2,cried a river hoping it woild stop,"NSYNC although i wass not a boy band fan had great songs and albums. I dont know where Justion lost that becausde as far as JUSTIFUED is concerned I wouldnt even make Sadaam listen to this album... I swear if he didnt look like he does this album wouldnt have sold. and the fact Christina out staged him on tour everynight prooves this. I dont know hwat he was thinking making her go first he dancing, singing and stage show was better then his in everyway and her songs are acctually good.1Senorita(0/10)2Like I Love You(6/10)3(oh No)What You Got(1/10)4Take It Frim Here(3/10)5Cry Me A River(9/10)6Rock Your Body(9/10)7Nothin' Else(8/10)8Last Night(4/10)9Still On My Brain(0/10)10(And She Said)Take Me Now(1/10)11Right For Me(2/10)12Let's Take A Ride(2/10)13Never Again(0/10)overall grade 34.6%F"
1,This C.d JUSTIFIED my growing hatred for justin,"When it all boils down too it Justin thinks he is tough and black. Now, as the American public should know he is neither of those things. Infact he isn't even a very good singer! The only acceptable reason for buying one of his c.d's would be to make fun of it! Anybody who buys this c.d to actually litsen too it has serious issues!"
5,It grows on you!,"I am a 31 year old woman and not afraid to admit that I'm a big *NSYNC fan. I bought this cd expecting more of an *NSYNC sound. I had already heard ""Like I Love You"" and really liked that song but when I first listened to this cd, I wasn't quite sure what to think. It was so different than what I expected. The more I listened to it, the more I loved it. It totally grows on you and there is not one song I don't like. My favorites are #3,5,7,9,10,13. It's an album for anyone who likes the old R&B sound. Definitely a Stevie Wonder, Prince, Michael Jackson feel to it. How could you not like it? Justin's incredible talent is really displayed in this cd."
4,It will grow on you,"If you are an NSync fan and like the first single ""Like I Love You"", you might be suprise at this cd. You probably won't like it right from the start since it is not want you are expecting. However, please give it sometime, it will grow on you."
1,"Cry me a river won""t be hard to do","This geek is the dumbest freak iv""e ever seen, How can anyone call this sh** music and tell me HOT women are going to chase this baboon around unless they want fleas.If anyone goes to his concert you""re as ugly as he is."
2,"It's OK , I guess...","Well, first off , don't get mad at me, 'cause what I'm about to say was not going to be that good.NSYNC fan and JT fans, sorry.I bought this album because I thought it would maybe sound like nsync's ""Pop"", ""Celebrity"" etc. But I was totally wrong. Not that I hated it, it has some good songs in it, but again, it wasn't that good. Honestly, I was kind of disappointed. He could've done better."
2,Go Back To NSync,"I am totally unimpress with this cd. It sounds like he's trying to be Michael Jackson or something. Also he is using the same tired producers (Neptunes and Timbaland) that everyone and their mother is using. If you want to hear a REAL blue-eyed soul artist, then pick up Remy Shand, Jon B. or Hall and Oates. But not this guy, Justin."
4,Growes on you,"Justin Timberlake is a great singer and dancer however i was not so impressed by this at first. ""Like i love you"" growed on me the more i heard it and i really started to like it. ""Cry me a river"" is good too. ""Senorita"" and ""Rock your body"" were songs i didn't like at first but then adored. It's an interesting debut, with some notable songs, Neptunes made 2,Timbaland 1, 2 are about his quite famous-ex girlfriend( Never again is a ballad by the way) and rappers appear on some aswell, and also Janet Jackson on ""Take Me Now"" It's a little too much soul here, feels like he wanna look like something ne. I don't mean he should neccesary make an album with teen-pop but some more variation would do well. But it's an allright album in the end, maybe the start of his solo career for real."
3,"not the next michael, but still sort of cool","I bought this album months ago. Mostly I love it for the neptunes and timbaland beats, but I prefer timabland's production instead. Cry Me a River and Take Me Now are excellent. He is not the next michael jackson, no one will ever be, but those two songs I mentioned are beautifully produced by timbaland and are very soulful. Actually, justin is like a modern day combination of michael jackson, prince and george michael, except not as good, but the album is worth it for those 2 songs alone."
3,Mediocre...You Make The Call,"This cd is not THAT bad and it's not great either. Most of the songs on this cd are basically a crossover from pop to R&B. If only more songs like ""Cry Me A River"" were on this cd, his solo debute could have songs that could hold up over time rather than a ""hit"" at this very moment. His vocals are satisfying but the lyrics of the songs just don't hold up. He actually pulls off some of the songs like the very club friendly ""Rock Your Body"" but he tries too much with his new sound and eventually the songs end up becoming too bland..."
1,No Actually Let Me Set My Review Straight,When I said that the 10 year olds dig him....well you misunderstood. I did use the 10 year olds as an example because my younger brother in 4th grade says all of his classmates love Justin Timberlake. If we really want to get this accurate....I would say that 10 and younger dig this cd.Maybe there are some smart ten year olds out there who actually know that this Cd is nothing but an impersonation of the genius called michael Jackson! lol. Anyways! Get a life Justin.
2,Justin Just Doesn't Justify,"The only two songs that caught my fancy at all on this was ""Rock Your Body"" and ""Senorita."" ""Rock Your Body"" was an obvious Michael Jackson rip-off but I liked it anyway. The only unique sounding song was ""Senorita"". Don't care for Justin Timberlake personally and the SuperBowl and a few incidents afterwards has made me lose more respect for him as a person but musically, he has potential but he really needs to get his own identity instead of trying to be the ""white"" M.J."
4,Karen's review of Justified,"Though definitely not as good as an NSYNC album, Justin still did a pretty good job with his first solo effort. And he co-write all 13 songs on the album. Some might say he's copying Michael Jackson. While the styles are somewhat similar, I still don't see it as a copy. The best song on the album is Cry Me A River, which was produced by Timbaland. It's got that great classic Timbaland vibe to it, kinda like something Aaliyah used to sing. My other fave song is Never Again. It's a great ballad co-written and produced by Brian McKnight, that Justin's voice really shines on. Justin fans will not be disappointed by this album."
2,Nice try,"True, his songs are danceable and catchy but they are basically for people who like to dance in groups, kind of like those zombies in Jacko's Thriller video. He's basically the next Michael Jackson cuz [...]. After seeing how he got Punk'd so bad he called his mom to bail him out I can't see why anyone would have respect for him."
1,Making it shut up....,"This horrid lad - all over the tv and radio. *cries*. Cant bear it. He is a ex-boyband member (what could be worse, now really) with about as much talent as your average Joe Carew. Having to listen to most of this album while it being played in the background of a music shop. Cant I just browse for music in PEACE. And the videos? What I have seen now this 'senorita' is beyond stupidity. And have you with the 'rock your body' video scenario? Horrible, just horrible. Is he apparently the best looking lad ever? *laughs*"
3,is this cd what it's cracked up to be?,the answer to that question is not really. there are only about 4 good songs and the rest are all alike and annoying after awhile. idk but it's an ok cd but it get annoying after awhile!
1,UNCHARISMATIC POP SINGER -------- HORRIBLE MUSIC .,"Listening to this horribly boring singer gave me a headache.Its truly the worst music Ive ever heard. If you want to hear great music , DONT buy this crappy cd ."
2,No Justification!,"Why, why, why? Justin Timberlake sings like he still has not reached puberty. His high pitched wailing is laughably hilarious, especially as I'm trying to imagine him trying to ""rock my body"". Whatever Justin. It comes off as whining rather than moaning. Some songs have a good hook, but it's not really worth paying full price."
3,Justified: R&B or Pop?,"Ok, here's the thing. Justin, as we all know, is from 'NSync. 'Nsync definitely are categorized as pop/rock. I would call this album r&b/soul. The neat thing about Justin is that he can go from pop star to r&b Star just like that. The boy definitely has some raw talent, and this album really shows it off. So, this album is great for r&b fans. If you loved Justin in 'NSync, I'm not so sure if you'll love this album. That's just my prediction, but hey, you never know. I own every 'NSync album and I still love ""Justified"". Maybe that's because I like every music genre...but anyways, do you see my point? Sorry if I'm sounding confusing. I'll just leave you with the fact that Justin CAN sing. There is no denying that. If I were you, I would give this album a try."
1,Here's A Little Secret,"For you youngsters, the riff from ""Cry Me A River"" is a rip off of a Led Zeppelin tune very poorly executed. Any way you slice it, this is very poor pop. Sorry to be the conduit of bad news but Justin has no vocal ability."
3,Too much Michael,"This album is cute. I wasn't expecting anything prolific or deep from Justin, so I guess I got what I expected.However, this album is not a masterpiece. It's no better, or probably worse, than Usher's ""8701"", and it's comparable to Michael Jackson's ""Invincible.""The only thing that upset me was that he sounded too much like MJ. I don't need to hear you sound like MJ. I already have all his albums. I knew that he liked to impersonate MJ from his VMA performance, but really? What's really going on? And was it me, or did ""Rock Your Body,"" sound like an updated version of ""Rock With You?""If and when Justin matures, and leaves his MJ impersonations behind, he might actually become something other than just another teen pop sensation."
4,It does what it says on the box!,"Slip this cd into your machine and lie back. The first track is as beautifully laid back as you can get with gentle analogue sounds floating around the room. Or if this is too quiet head to track three, the Indiangeneralsan mix, which manages to retain the beauty of the track while adding Skint's trademark phat beats. A real beauty."
2,Uninteresting and even less useful for the present day,"I don't think this book is all that useful. It's tiny, which means it's supposed to be appropriate for keeping in your purse or other bag, but there isn't enough information in here for you to need a book like this for your travels to South Korea. I'll give them credit for presenting some interesting trivia--such as the fact that Koreans think many Americans smell bad--and at least they do give some Korean phrases that can be helpful for the non-Korean English speaker. However, if you want to really understand South Koreans and their businessmen today, this book does not tell you much.The book is outdated too, and certainly not worth the price. Do yourself a favor and get a South Korean etiquette guide that is NOT pocket-sized. Having a book chock-full of etiquette information is better than a tiny book with barely any information."
5,NICE PRODUCT,"THIS ITEM WOULD BE RECOMMENDED, BECAUSE IT'S NICE ON THE SKIN AND SOFTEN AND LEAVES PRETTY CLEAR SKIN, THIS WOULD BE INCLUDED IN A GIFT BAG."
2,Voluminous Clumps,"I like that this mascara has a curved brush because I get more coverage in one swoop and can reach the lashes in the corners easier. But the problem is there is too much mascara being left on the brush when I pull it out of the container. It leaves clumps of mascara on my lashes. The opening is too big to remove the excess. I tried this product a few years ago and thought it would have improved my now, but still the same problem."
1,"Wow, I must be unenlightened","...because this book, to me, embodies absolute, sexist tripe. The imagery is beautiful - angels, perfumed seas and so on - as are the prayers which are the only things worth reading in the book. The instructions are vague, and the message is lost somewhere in all of that rambling. Not only is this book sexist, it is cruelly insensitive to those not in relationship (""no one gets into heaven alone""), and also ignores those who might have alternative lifestyles. She should have just published the prayers."
2,pg 130+ pat allen plug i like,"sorry m.w. your ""return to love"" is commited to my memory so i thought you left the best parts of that out. i am just not mushy enough for this one."
1,Worst Purchase!,I had to return this book. It is outdated compared to the other bible dictionaries out there. I wouldn't waste my time purchasing this book. It doesn't contain much information. I wouldn't want this dictionary if it was given to me free. A regular dictionary may be better than this one.
3,Smith's Bible Dictionary,I think this dictionary is okay for beginners and those reaching intermediate in their biblical studies...I was looking for a more in depth dictionary and more words covered than the 'Smith Bible Dictionary' offers....It does have a lot of drawings (black and white) that some may feel are helpful....
4,I enjoy it as well,I sing right along with my boys to make them more involved. The boys do enjoy it and it keeps them busy while I do things around the house.
5,Excellent Resource!,I bought this for my four-year old grandson who needed some extra help learning his alphabet. He loved watching the Leap Frog DVDs and he made noticeable improvement in just a couple of weeks. I highly recommend it!
5,"Replacement Bags Available, no Sweat","I bought this vacuum, it came with 3 bags, and I ordered the bag kit (asin: B0002YSDHQ) from Small Appliance via Amazon because I was a little concerned based on a couple of these reviews. The bags in the kit are identical to the ones that came with the vacuum. There's no problem whatsoever getting replacement bags.This is an awesome vacuum, with loads of power and small enough to store anywhere -- highly recommend it, especially for those of you who live in a city apartment where space is at a premium. If I have any probs with it, I'll write another review; if you don't see anything further, know that my place is clean and I'm loving this sweet vacuum! Pick one up already!"
4,like it a lot,"I like this vacuum for the kitchen, because it gets under the counters. Bags are hard to find, but Amazon does sell them. Does not work too well on carpet."
2,less about food than a feminist critique,"this book was not so much about food and the best things ever tasted than it is about the author's feminist views about cooking and women's plight in the kitchen. disappointing. a much better read is ""last chance to eat"" by Gina Mallet."
2,The Point?,"What is Sallie Tisdale trying to say with this book? I read the entire book over the course of 3 months (small portions) and I never discovered ""the secret of food."" This book is over 311 pages of disconnected musings. Each musing is well-written but there isn't a coherent whole. Its more like a coherent hole. A second helping? No thank you."
2,Occasionally interesting but she needs an editor!,"While there are some interesting bits in this work, the author truly needed an editor who could organize the material. The book lacks focus and the author couldn't seem to decide what she wanted to write. Is this a memoir? Is this a work of gastronomic history? Is this a study of some aspects of American popular culture? It was not at all clear to me after a few days of laborious reading why this book was written."
4,Informative & funny,This book is very informative as it gives you a look back to the history of rollerderby and the low down on how the revival came about. Lots of helpful tips for leagues & girls just starting out as well as some funny stories about roller girl antics.
2,Disappointing,"While Melicious' book does provide some insight into the modern roller derby revival, ""Totally True"" it's not. It is factual - that is to say there is nothing ""made up,"" but she was under no obligation to apply journalistic standards of balance and integrity to her book. The facts that she did select reflect this."
2,Disappointing,"I heard the track ""Lisa Told Me"" on Mojo Magazine's punk sampler CD and was thoroughly impressed. The aforementioned song is a feedback-laden, rhythmic piece of punk perfection! Not pop at all, but definitely musical. I bought the disc based on this single track...and I think I made a mistake. Most of the cuts are full of lead vocals screaming over layers of guitar without a hint of the musicianship displayed on ""Lisa Told Me."""
4,Just gets better with successive listenings,"First, let me say I much prefer this album to his earlier ""Australia,"" which some reviewers feel was better. I think it depends on which record you happened to hear first, which sets in place your expectations for what Howie's music should sound like.""Stop All the World"" has more energy, better production and is just a more well-rounded album. ""Australia"" is more personal, angst-filled and, in my opinion, a bit morose. There is passion aplenty on ""Stop All the World,"" and after two years of listening, I still find myself blown away at certain passages or musical segments (e.g., Brace Yourself and I'll Take You On). I very much look forward to Day's third album."
5,"Emotional, Uplifting with Great Music",I purchased this movie after hearing the sound track from Kenny Vance. I thought it would be good but I was surprisingly delighted by story line. It was about a great family man portrayed by Armand Assante. His love of music and his family and friends bring about this great movie. He had been the lead singer of a Doo Wop group which had come to an end when Doo Wop was taken over by Rock and Roll. He always dreamed of what life would have been if his singing career hadn't ended. With the help of his loving family and friends for one night that dream came true.
2,You get what you pay for,What I didnt like about this product was that after 2 weeks of use the LCD is very dim and can hardly see the screen.
1,Franklin TWE-118 5 Language European Translator,"Rubbish, it can translate only all 5 languages to Spanish only, you can't translate french to English, rubbish ever seen."
3,"intriguing premise, mediocre acting and execution","The plot revolves around a newfangled designer drug that creates an insatiable thirst for blood. As it is distibuted to unsuspecting users, unintended consequences abound. The entire concept of a designer drug wreaking havoc has not been extensively played out and so this makes the theme somewhat fresh. Obviously the low-budget of this film created constraints that are fairly obvious, but the acceptable thespian skills of main players made the story at least watchable... which is more than I can say for many subpar horror dogs like ""Fate"" ""Decoys"" and their ilk."
2,Horrible Game!,"The reason i give this game a 2 is because first of all the control is horrible. The graphics are good, the music in the game is not so bad either. The levels dont make any sense and you have to play for like 1 hour in order for you to be able to save. In the begginig theres this whole test thing learning how to punch and drive which was just a wast of time. It has some concepts of GTA like taking the people car's although in this game he's a cop himself,so he's exactly stealing the car. By the time you get through those crowded streets on the slow cars to the robber or rapist you already lost. I give it a 2 just because of the graphics if the graphics sucked it would be a -1. So, this game is a total waist of $50,trust me, go and buy 50 cent rather than this."
5,A Dynamic Album,"Features love song classic ""Cherish"", as well as, hits ""Fresh"", ""Misled"" and ""Emergency"". A defining album of the 1980s.This album is a must for any music collection. It will leave you wanting more."
4,Quality Dance Music And More,"This CD can satisfy hip-hoppers, disco bunnies, soul freaks, and even some easy listening fans and rock n rollers like myself. These seven songs have a driving beat, funky rhythms, some good lyrics, and loads of energy. Its just so Fresh man. My only issue is that there are just seven tracks here. Why couldn't the guys add on another track or two. Allright the last song goes on a little too long but if you are dancing up a storm are you really going to notice? Don't be Misled, pick this one up."
5,A classic!,"I'm not sure why an album by MC Madness and DJ Lace (only ""featuring"" Magic Mike) gets listed under Magic Mike here, but whatever.As for the content, it's excellent. ""You Want Bass"" and ""All Wild DJ's He Will Tame"" are some of the best tracks of the era. There's a lot of ""filler cuts"" which are nothing more than bad skits, which is typical for these albums. ""Are You Ready"" and ""Nice & Nasty are additional standouts. The Doobie Brothers ""Long Train Runnin'"" sample in AWDHWT is one of the best ""fits"" as a sample I heard at the time.Overall, it's an excellent bass/rap album. A definite collectors item!"
4,Classic karate from an American pioneer,"I purchased a 1963 first edition copy of this classic book in good condition, but plan to purchase a used paperback for use in practice.Good pictures and down to earth explanations. No mystical walk-thru-walls or super human power talk.The book is divided into a short section on philosophy, a short terminology chapter (enough to get through a traditional class and body parts), stretching chapter, and others.The strength of this book is in the description of Sanchin and Sesan. This is why the book warrants the 4 star rating in my opinion. The book is a good overview, but I would recommend learning from a proficient instructor.For more in depth Karate information, especially on Uechi Ryu, I recommend The Encyclopedia of Karate and Related Arts, by Ted Kresge. The book was checked by Master Kanei Uechi before publishing. It can be very difficult to find."
5,Absolutely loved it!,"Bob Doyle oozes sincerity - you can't help but feel he is absolutely committed to helping you be successful. I found the book straightforward, esay to read, and gave excellent explanations of the Law of Attraction as well as easy strategies to clear up obstacles.I am definitely a Bob Doyle fan.Zoe Routh"
4,A Three Timer,This was indeed a good read and uplifting to one's basic inner instincts just what we need in todays madding world! Bob is kind of a turn on as well.
5,Historical Fiction at its Best,"This book packs adventure, strong characters, and an accurate account of early Texas history into a literary delight for young readers. Perfect as a ""read-aloud,"" this book captures the interests of students ranging from those with ""sensitive souls"" to the ""rough-and-tumble"" variety. Chronicling an immigrant family from Germany who left Europe to find freedom, readers experience authentic pioneer adventure as the main character, Johnny, a ten year old boy, learns some of life's hardest lessons. I appreciated this book for its eye-opening treatment of the slavery issue. Many of my third grade students developed a deeper sensitivity and gratitude for their personal freedoms after the reading of this book. There are many ""cliff-hanger"" moments in this writing and be prepared,you may need a tissue every now and then. You'll enjoy reading this book again and again whether you are from Texas or not."
4,Thinking Outside Our Box,"Appiah brings a unique multicultural perspective, English and Ghanaian, to living in a global village and recognizing what is local and what is universal in our ethical understanding. He challenges all kinds of assumptions and truisms, like regarding art and artifacts as the patrimony of a particular nation or people. Debunking the widely held notion that we all agree about values and just implement the same values in different ways is the central focus of this unusual, well-written and very timely book."
2,A book lacking any drama or gripping narrative,"OK. So you what to know about the final weeks of the Petersburg Campaign during the War Bewteen the States. This book gives an in-depth picture of what General Lee had described the previous year as ""a mere matter of time."" The piece is well-documented, which you would expect from the head of the park (the author) where the Federal forces broke through Confederate lines. And there are lots of good maps to follow the action. But, in my opinion, the prose is VERY pedestrian, resulting in a narrative lacking any sense of drama, and therefore is far less than an exciting read."
5,Petersburg,I was surprized by the depth and freshness of coverage of this fast flowing account as the last days of Lee's power unfold. A good well balanced narrative.Greene is right up there with top civil war historians in my estimation. A hightlight for me was the touring infomation he provides on the battlefild sites. Last summeer I spent two days trying to cover as much of the Petersburg Battle and Appomatix retreat as my time allowed. This book would have made my trip much more effective. I applaude the efforts currently being made to preserve these site.If one is diligent he can find defensive pits still in good condition that remain unprotected by walking in the woods off the main Five Points byways. How long will they last this way?
4,Great read but not so much in depth,"Excellent reading, diligent with references to facts but kind of a synopsis of the action. It lacks an in depth look at the battles and the action at the defensive positions of both sides during the Petersburg siege. Nor does it have much to say about the action surrounding the infamous ""CRATER"".Just briefly covers Grants continuous movement to the left to cutoff Confederate access to the rails and lengthen Lee's lines of defense. Or the important cavalry engagements related to it.If you want an excellent, easy to read overview here it is"
1,The Mozart Influence is obvious,"I loved the bagpipes solo in track 3. The tin whistle section was also a highlight. The classical piano overtones in the title track were very imaginatly presented, espiacially in the concerto section were the conducter of Manson's orchestra double the tempo of the operatic section. The opera vocalists in this album are certainly the breaking point of this of his panflute skills. This album is a very happy sounding album. It is very merry."
1,"Marilyn Manson, Antimusic Superstar","If you love Marilyn Manson, you'll hate Mechanical Animals. If you've always thought Marilyn Manson was a bit too much, this is the album for you. The thing that always kept my generation glued to Manson wasn't the antics, the devil, or the shock value (despite popular belief). It was the sheer musical emotion, and the way lyrics like ""just a boy, just a little f***ing boy, I can never be a man"" and ""You never ever believed in me, I am your tournaquit"" seemed to echo the feelings we were struggling with.Unless you're a fashion designer, a make-up artist for a movie studio, or a heroin addict stripped of all feeling whatsoever, chances are Marilyn Manson won't say that much that anyone could ever identify with on this release. And as far as cutting edge musicianship.... well, no.Highlghts Rock is Better Than Dead* Great Big White World Low LightsPretty much everything else having anything to do with this album, the tour that follows, or any artwork herein."
1,"fun, if you define that as picking you nose with your auntie","Just like when the Door's catered to the general public with ""Touch Me"". Recording this album was no more ingenious than if Manson had picked his nose."
4,Great game!,"It is a lot of fun playing Harry Potter with the Wiimote. The graphics are great! Sometimes you get stuck in a task that you can't figure out, but just take a break and come back to it; it's easy then! Have fun!"
5,Victorian Doormat,"Good heavyweight mat, very beautiful,easy to clean,looks great. From a distance it gives the appearance of wrought iron and goes bautifully with our fence. One shortcoming though. I would not use this in the home of anyone who has problems with mobility, such as the elderly, as it is a thick mat and the openings in the design might cause them to trip. Other than that a super product and well worth the money."
2,"Like many others, full of refined sugar","I bought this for my daughter who is suffering with malabsorption. She gains weight on this formula but due to loads of corn syrup solids (refined sugar), her temperament was very poor and her eczema was also exacerbated on this formula. I find it shocking that so many infant formulas on the market contain such awful ingredients."
2,Cheap Quality. Chairs Not As Pictured,These Chairs are pictured as Arrowback Chairs but what is shipped is a substitute. The chairs are cheaply made and they shorted me the hardware for the 4th chair. Rough paint not smooth as they should be. . Look closely and you'll see some spots where wood shows thru paint. Moshya Home Furniture does not return phone calls or answer phone. Amazon's A-Z team also will not speak to customer 1 on 1. My research shows Moshya Home Furniture has issues with other customers as well.Also the seat is thin not formed for comefort. Feels like sitting on a thick piece of plywood..I kid you not. Anyone know where I can buy a GOOD quality set of Windsor Arrowback chairs ? I have 4 defective ones bound for the landfill.
5,"A gentle, lovely smelling soap.","I love this soap. It's gentle enough even to cleanse the face with. I have acne prone skin and it did not irritate it at all. Nor is it poor clogging.The combination of Rosemary and Lavender is a lovely scent. Rosemary being one of my personal favorites.This particular bar is not exfoliating, unless you use the herbs that stick on one side of the soap for a gentle scrub. The herbs do occasionally fall off the bar and into the shower, as with all these natural soaps. I will be buying again."
3,too much lather,"The fragrance is great and it is very gentle on my 3 year old's skin. It has helped a lot with her dry skin and rashes. The problem is that it breaks down with water too quickly. If you are rubbing it in your hands and it is wet, it gets pretty slimy. We used it up very fast. If it came in a liquid, it might be better. I would still buy it since it really helps your skin."
4,"Good, Informative Reading!!!",Well done guide for the 30+ person contemplating hiking all or part of the Trail!!! Great equipment recommendations and advice about mileage expectations.
3,Slow Hike on the Appalachian,"This book is thin on fact and information. I found it slow and generly mediocre. It is one of the less interesting books that I have read about the appalachian trail so far. It is also very thin, like reading an after thought. I put the book in the middle as far as interest and adventure. It is still higher then the one I read about the girl that got as far as the White Mountain and quit. That book is in the give away pile."
1,Don't waste your Money,There is little or no information for the older hiker. In fact there is way more information on the Appalachian trail website than in this book. I would not use this book as a reference for planning a hike on the trail. I have never written a review before but if this helps someone then it was worth the time. I have purchased several books on hiking the Appalachian trail and this book is the least informative. Save your money and buy something else.
4,"i like it a lot, but their old school stuff is good too.","i absolutely love the beastie boys. i am a huge fan and i have 5 of the cds. i really like hello nasty but i think that a few of the tracks on the cd arent what the b-boys usually come up with, a little different than their usual sound. still, there are quite a few really amazing songs. i like 3 mc's and 1 dj, putting shame in your game, super disco breakin', body movin and intergalactic. if you like their sound i suggest you check out some of their older albums, paul's boutique is definately worth it... if you want to buy something with more songs that were popular then you should try licensed to ill. the group is really creative and i absolutely love their music!!"
4,Exiciting,"I think the Beastie Boys put a lot of effort into this album. I think the song ""Intergalatic"" was dope! This is their best album yet."
1,"Just buy the Intergalactic single, save some money!!","I am a long-time Beastie fan, but their newest CD is just not up to par. Sure, I like the song Intergalactic, but that is just about all I like. Their old CD's are easy to listen to over and over again, but this one gets old after the first few songs. All in all, it is not worth the 15 bucks you'll have to pay for it."
3,nice,"this was my first beastie boys album and i loved it so much that i bought all their others. After listening to Paul's Boutique and Check your Head i have to say that Hello Nasty is not their best work. Still, it's better than 99% of today's music. i have to admit that the so-called ""filler"" tracks are my favorites. i love ""song for the man"" and ""and me"" and ""remote control"" and ""i don't know"" and i think my favorite song on the entire album is ""instant death"". i guess if you want to party these aren't the appropriate songs, but i think these songs show a nice transition from party guys to grown men and ""instant death"" and ""i don't know"" are two of the most open, honest songs i've ever heard. to sum it up, not exactly Paul's Boutique but they aren't exactly 24 anymore so give em a break."
2,Ughhh Busta Rhymes might as well have done this,"Im a huge BEastie Boys fan and this album was a bit of a dissapointment. Sure if this were any other band they would have 3, maybe 4 stars but from the Beasties this reeks of laziness. Gone is the inventiveness they displayed in their albums up to Check your head, and to a lesser extent Ill Communication. Instead its just same old same old. Its not a bad album per se, its just from the Beasties I would expect more you know. And well the approach to most the songs is formulaic. Except for Instant Death which is a touching moment of such warmth. I dont know why but that song really touched me. Apart from that Id say avoid if you are a true Beasties fan cos it is kind of a dissapointment, otherwise a fairly decent 90's hip-hop thang."
5,PHAT,"This has to be one of the best B-Boy's album yet. I glad they moved away from the punk and back to the funk. It's good, but not as good as Paul's Boutique. I also like the way they used some old school songs in their tracks."
2,The only good Song is Intergalactic,i have listened to the entire CD and out of 22 songs the best one is Intergalactic. Many of you may disagree but this is my view
1,LOUSY! LOUSY! LOUSY! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,THIS IS REALLY PATHETIC THAT THESE WANNABES ARE STILL HANGING ON BY A THREAD. ANYONE WITH ONE OUNCE OF APPRECIATION FOR ART AND MUSIC WOULD NEVER BUY THIS JUNK! AFTER LISTENING TO THE C.D. I FELT LIKE I WANTED TO THROW MY LUNCH IN CHUNKS ACROSS THE FLOOR. THEY'RE THE MOST UNORIGINAL AND COPYCAT BAND I'VE EVER HEARD. THEIR MUSIC IS NOT WORTH THE COST OF THE PLASTIC C.D.
5,Mom said rock it til the BREAK OF DAWN!!!!,"By far the most eclectic BBOYS joint yet...a combination of all that was brilliant from their first four albums. Anyone that says this album is weak just doesn't know what true hip-hop and bboys style is all about! From the moment I popped the disc in...chills were running down my spine and my neck wouldn't stop twitching. Probably the most clever lyricists of all time, this clinches their spot amongst all time hip hop greats!!! Don't ever stop dropping albums boys."
4,Beastie's Best in 9 years,"This album is wonderfull, masterfull samples, groovin' beats and great raps make this the best Rap CD i've heard in quite some time."
2,long time dissapointed fan.,"this cd was definitely the worst beastie album, but it was still the beastie boys. its not horrible, but if i didn't have it yet, I wouldn't buy it."
2,Waste of money...,"This alubum has like 2 decent songs, then the rest of the cd is just filler material. I expected more. Do not buy this."
2,You've heard better.,"Three quarters of this album is a complete waste of time,effortless and repetitive.The other quarter however is generally entertaining and well developed.Rent it from the library and record it onto tape or MD.But don't buy it."
2,"Some songs pretty good, most not that great.","This CD was kind of a dissapointment. A lot of the songs didn't sound like the Beastie Boys, and those that did weren't as funky as their older stuff."
2,".. thin, watered down.. no more fun?",pauls boutique is what you ALL need to get. .. this is all hype
5,Great CD!,"I bought this CD has a birthday gift for my cousin. I then listened to the CD myslef and it's one of the best rap CD's I have ever listened to. I normally don't listen to the Beastie Boys that much, but this CD is definately the CD to buy!"
2,Far weaker than their previous albums,"This doesn't hold a candle to Check Your Head or Paul's Boutique. There are some decent tracks, but lyrically this was a huge slide for them. It just sounds forced and there is a lot of mediocre filler...Buy one of those two albums first (CYH or PB), then get Ill Communication and Licensed to Ill. This album is better than 5 boroughs but thats about it..."
4,Nice!,"This book covers everything a young rider needs to know about showing. It has descriptions of different classes, helpful hints and trouble shooting, and it's easy to understand. If an adult tried to read it, it might not be as helpful. But overall, a great book!"
1,Disappointing,"This video was little more than (very) shaky home video of ponies in a backyard pasture. My seven year old daughter is intrigued with everything Misty and I thought it would be fun for her to watch a documentary and learn more about the lives of the ponies. This was definitely not that. She watches very little tv and is usually captivated by anything on screen -- especially horses -- but this did not hold her attention past the first five minutes. And the constantly shaking and bumping footage made my head ache!! Clearly, the five star ratings were given by friends or family of the director.To charge $19.95 for this is robbery!!"
4,Almost five stars,"Up, happy beach music very similar to Jack Johnson. Catchy tunes, and kind of predictable but fun nun the less. Very commercial and should be a house-hold name..oh well."
1,Failed after 90 days,"I bought this product to use for nailing a small wooden shed. It worked fine for a couple of weeks, until a spring fell off. I managed to use a rubber grommet to keep the slide from opening each time the gun went off. Then, after 90 days, it quit cycling. I have another gun and it worked fine, so it wasn't the compressor. Bostich warranty says that any normal wear on the product isn't covered--but after 90 days, should the parts wear out? Never again."
4,Good product,Very nice alternative to expensive kayak racks. No issues at all transporting yak 400 miles on interstate.
5,Just what I wanted!,"This clock is just what I was looking for - a large, metal clock that is easy to see from a distance. The quality is great and just as described. Packing was carefully done and hanging the clock was easy. It ticks very quietly and you really don't notice it even in a quiet room."
4,Howard Miller Clock,"The clock was just as ordered. Just what we wanted. it arrived in under a week to here in Australia. The only problem was the packaging! The outer box was 2 1/2 times the size of the clock, so the post office would not deliver it. Had to make a 60km round trip to the freight depot! The clock is only approximately 22 inches, but with all the packaging I could just fit in my car. A case of overkill."
3,Tweaky Backs Need to Modify,"I love Jillian Michaels! I wanted to love Killer Buns and Thighs. First, I did find the interaction between Jillian and her girls annoying after a couple viewings. Get serious, please. This is my workout! Beyond that, the actual workout is tough. I was on level 1 and needed to modify some of her moves because my knees would kill for days afterwards or my back. You will have needed someone to really show you how to do burpees with good form before engaging in this workout. The risk is like me you are a cardio queen with some weight room experience that doesn't translate into good form on some of these combination movements. So far this workout has resulted in me taking a lot of time off for inflammation (tendinitis/bursitis) and strained back muscles. =("
3,Okay,I have not completed all the workouts yet but from the first and second level workouts I can say its a good DVD. It works!
5,Great workout!,"I love this dvd! I think my body has gotten used to most of the workout dvds I already had a home... since they dont make me sweat too much anymore. I decided to try Jillian and am so glad I did! The workout sessions on this one are not even a full hour and she leaves me drenched! Its just what I needed, cardio and toning all in one! I love it! I would definitely recommend this one. I am going to try some of her other dvds as well."
4,Great Workout but Jillian gets SUPER Annoying,I really like the workout but I find myself not picking it as my morning workout too often because the interaction between Jillian and Natalie is beyond annoying. She doesn't stop talking and I just don't care to hear her giggle/chitchat with Natalie ALLLLLLLL dvd.
1,Unreadable Disc,"I've only seen one other review stating this, so I'm taking the time to put it out there. I ordered this disc through Amazon and when I tried to play it on my DVD player and computer DVD drive, I got an error message stating that ""This disc does not have a playback feature"". I am returning it to Amazon and asking for a replacement. Hopefully the new one will arrive without incident and I will update my review to comment on the actual content of the disc...supposing this next copy actually HAS content. =/"
3,OK,"this video is much diiferent then the others I have.......I liked it in the begining but when I went to do the 2nd workout on this dvd, you need a chair to stand on and I don't care for that to much."
1,Save your money & find something more fun,"I do not mind hard work. I have always been into fitness. I generally think Jillian is interesting on TV, but not in this video. She is annoying and this is boring to watch. If one is bored then we won't be interested in the work-out. So save your money and try anyone else from Callanetics (way old) to Richard Simmons way fun or the classic CIndy Crawford dvds. And especially Adrienne Reed and her different levels of yoga. I believe people just say that they like this video but it has NO long-term staying power like those of other people I have mentioned. This is an awful video even if the exercises work. It doesn't hold my interest at all. AND her babbling on about Twitter/Facebook over and over it not something I want to hear. Save your money!!!!!!"
5,Very good!,What I really like about this workout video it's that Jillian michaels it's always giving opttions to make your workout harder or keep it at low pace if you are not use to some of the exercises. Very helpful video!
5,Killer buns and thighs delivers!,"I have tried almost all of Jillian Michaels DVD's except for the Yoga meltdown which i plan on getting in the near future, but nothing tops this Killer Buns and Thighs workout. I was dripping in sweat 15 minutes in to the workout and I am a pretty in shape kind of girl. The plank to squat exercise killed me to no end. My thighs were on fire with all of the lunge exercises. And I am doing this review the day after and oh my goodness. MY legs are extra on fire. WHAT A GREAT WORKOUT JILLIAN but I dont know if I can do this everyday!"
5,Good work out,I love this tape! It isnt easy but it seems effective. At first I was soooo sore but then my body got used to it and I feel stronger!
5,Killer Workout,"I use to do the Buns of Steel way back when and Killer Buns and Thighs is way harder. Mind you, it's been over 6 years since I worked out. This is my first Jillian Michaels workout and I am sold. Did my first workout today, starting with level one and I know I will feel it tomorrow for sure. Sad but true, my 5 year daughter was doing the workout with me to keep me motivated...and she was able to finish the 30 minutes....mom, only 15 minutes. UGH. Order other Jillian Michaels' DVDs to mix the workout. I am 135pds, 5'2"" and my goal is to be 115. Giving myself 90 days to get there. Happy workout."
5,I NEVER PHONE IT IN WITH JILLIAN,"Jillian is my favorite. This is another GREAT workout DVD for you to add to your Jill collection. My buns and thighs were definitely killing even after the first workout. Let's see how Workout 2 & 3 go next week :). I highly recommend this and ANY of Jillian's workout DVDs.UPDATE YA'll! Level 1 is hard. BUT LEVEL 2 AND 3 ARE ABSOLUTELY INSANE IN THE BUTT BRAIN. I mean, how does she come up with some of these moves?! THE FROG JUMP!? WHAT WHAT?!?!?! Those of you who have gotten to level 3 know what I'm talking about, and those on their way to level 3, HAVE FUN!I saw somebody mentioned how Jillian talks non-stop (and found it annoying) in this particular DVD, and she does. But I found it rather amusing and motivating..haha."
4,Great workout,"Jillian Michaels is slightly obnoxious in this DVD because of people evidently saying her workouts aren't difficult enough. That may drive you crazy but that being said the DVD is a really great workout. I've done levels one and two and both are difficult. One thing I will say is that Jillian gives you the name of the exercise but doesn't do ""an example"" to show you how to perform it. For beginners who don't know the exercise lingo it may be hard to keep up. Also, at the end of level one she does stretches but not necessarily for your hips so I always stretch my hips out after the DVD is over. She does throw in a hip/butt stretch at the end of level two which is good. My butt is already perkier (for lack of better word) after a few workouts."
4,Great yoga music,I'm very happy with this CD...I get bored very quickly with the same yoga music and this is a great addition to my collection. I'm even listening to it on MP3 player because it's beautiful and relaxing.
4,"A Worthwhile ""Chick Book""","It really kept my interest and I could not wait to get to read it any chance that I had.The author did a great job sharing Cassandra's adolescent issues in the first person. In fact, it was disturbing at times to be reminded of how difficult it was to be that age. A lot of the story and situation was far fetched but it portrayed an atypical dysfunctional family very well and I felt the frustration I feel when I see dysfunction in real families, including my own. It wasn't really a happy ending and I definitely prefer happy endings. In fact, as much as it kept my interest, I feel mildly depressed just having finished it.It's not ""classic"" material but it is definitely bestseller quality."
4,character rich,"If you like Roahl Dahl or Stella Gibbons, then you will most definitely like this book. I had never heard of it until I read that J.K. Rowling liked it, so I bought it on those merits alone. Glad I did! Thoroughly enjoyable. Castles, gloominess, humor, clashing characters...it has it all."
3,A book without any ending is a waste to read . . .,"I set out on this book on tapes, I really cared about some of the characters and very much enjoyed the light sorry . . . than it got all muddled and ridiculous.There is no ending . . . I repeat . . . there is no ending!! Its as if the author was told she had 5 minutes to finish the book and just puts a period any where.The main character just ends up where she begins, like if she is 14 years old not 20, writing her journal with her cat and dog. The man who loves her becomes a film star, the man she she loved, is still in love with her sister. The cruel, violent, self centered father, becomes a success.No wonder there is only a few books written by this author."
2,Disapointing,"After reading all the great reviews, I was compelled to buy this book. It just did not live up to my expectations. I really did not like this book."
3,"Creepy, but compelling!","Reading Louis Drax's story is almost as exhausting as living through must be! The main character's life is one deep, dark, tragic secret after another, and there's barely a break in the misery. Somehow, this book manages to avoid becoming bogged down in all its negativity. You'll get something out of reading it, but you may not quite be sure what it is. Most likely, you'll be grateful that hardships like Louis' only happen in fiction!"
1,Stanley stapler & nailer,The heads of the nails would not sink flush with the wood and they sent me a new one. It did exactly the same thing! Too weak.
3,Its OK consdering you are getting 3-4-1,I collect movies and have an interest in classic films. The Marilyn Monroe film Hometown was not the best film of that era nor did it feature her for longer than 20 minutes. It is good to see her fresh before iconic status. I actually bought this DVD because I wanted to se Howard Hughes' film Outlaw. That in itself was worth it.
2,It is a totally different way of approaching food,"I do believe if someone is really sick they would make the supreme effort and eliminate many, many foods and start cooking with these recipes. I am put off by having to make almond milk using a nylon stocking for straining and I do not like the taste of coconut milk but these are used instead of milk in recipes. I have not tried any of the recipes yet so I cannot say either way if they are tasty or not. Maybe a video would be a better way of introducing consumers to this diet. I know the Juicer videos inspired me to try juicing all sorts of vegatables."
2,Too much waste,"This book assumes you can purchase 100% organic foods, and be able to waste half of what you buy. I didn't find this book practical."
3,Extremely Restrictive Diet,"If you are really into this, then great. But I have never seen such a limited, restrictive diet. Yea, I want to live longer and healthier but if I have to live eating like this, it's just not worth it to add a couple extra years when I'll be in my 90s anyway!If you're sick, it may very well be worth the effort."
4,Great book,I am interested in law and this book is very helpful in explaining legal terminology. The book gives easy to follow real life examples and the opprotunity to test my knowledge.
4,Enjoyable and Quirky,"Cimorene is the classic modern heroine--plucky and a tad off-step with her surroundings. The dragons are well charactorized and as interesting in their differentness as in their similarities with humans. The humans, other than our heroine and her friends, tend to be a bit flat, but as there aren't many of them, this can be forgiven.I wouldn't go so far as to call Dealing with Dragons a fantasy classic, but it's a worth-while read. Both I and my 9 year old daughter enjoyed it very much."
5,PERFECT!,"Really, this book is one of the best written this century!!! It combines all elements of good literature and really draws you in! The entire quartet of books is great, but this, the first, is (in my opinion) the best! ""Dealing with Dragons"" is absolutely PERFECT beyond all words!"
4,Dealing with Dragons,"In the book""Dealing with Dragons""there are lots of enjoyment you can get. For example:during the story, a princess who thinks being a pringess is dull, runs away to become a dragin's princess for a very powerful female dragon. Somehow she finds cooking and cleaning facinating. While reading this book you can find alot of adventure. Some adventures you can find are challenging a Death-Dealing Bird, a Witch, A Stone Prince,a Jinn, lots of Wizards and alot of Dragons, both good and bad. Read this book and dive into adventure with Cimerene and her new best friend Alianora on her journey to complete a very important mission to save the Dragons. The thing i liked about this book is when Kazul became a King because i think Kazul was one of the most powerful Dragons. The thing i didn't like about this book is when a dragon betrayed his own kind just to help out some evil wizards."
3,"Quick, Easy, Fun","Reading Dealing With Dragons was an enjoyable way to spend an hour of my time. It was not great, but it was not bad either. I appreciated that Cimorene was unlike most princesses, yet not unlikable. She was not spoiled, or disagreeable, just a normal girl that wanted to have some fun. I also appreciate that the story is more complex than simply how a girl spends time with a dragon. The wizards vs. dragons plot was entertaining, and all of the characters here are delightful. Since this is a children's book it is not overly complex, and it is not bogged down with unimportant details. A perfect balance of humor, adventure, and mystery. Short, sweet, and to the point, Dealing with Dragons would be a great book to read to children, or a nice book to sit down with and escape for a little while."
5,Whiskey in the Jar freakin rules!,"At nearly forty six years of age, I glad to hear new music I can identify with. My wife is Irish and I hear a lot of Irish folk songs... This hi me hard and sent me running to the store to get it. A very powerful rendition."
3,Have Heard Better,"As wonderful as this recording is, it is unfortunate that Barbara Hendricks' contribution is not as good as her previous recording. She frequently sings off pitch and her final passage is painful on the ear."
1,I haven't recieved it!!!,"I still don't have this item and there doesn't seem to be an easy way to get the tracking done. Amazon sends ""do not reply"" emails, UPS says ""it was delivered to the porch,"" and the shipper has to request a trace but, the shipper hasn't responded to me!!It looks like the product I need and the price was good, but, my money is gone and I've got nothing!This is probably not the review you were hoping for...."
1,Zero Tolerance is Right,"Let me begin by saying that I hold three music degrees, one of them a doctorate. I've studied and appreciated lots of modern music/electronic/experimental/acid jazz/you name it. And I'm a huge Pat Metheny fan. But this is the worst damn thing I've ever heard."
2,I have a theory about this one,"I think it was an experiment: ""Can I make an album of outside guitar playing ... using my FEET?"
2,Zero Tolerance for this One!,"How an artist of repute such as Pat Methany can get people / fans to spend their hard earned money to buy such nonsence and sheer over indulgence amazes me. Its like a painter selling an empty canavas as a peice of art.This is the WORST ALBUM I have ever bought - Jazz, Rock or otherwise. I listened to it once to see if I was missing any thing, I will never play it again.Don't even think of buying this one - Trust me, it's Garbage.Nov'2011 - The above was my review of the album some years back and it had to do with expectation from the artist.I'm not a musician or a music techie, I believe that this album has great value for these people and as I am not qualified to judge the album on these parameters I will hold on my earlier comments above and state that this is not an album for fans of Pat Methaney Group. It definately is not Garbage as I mentioned earlier. My appologies to the Artist."
1,Lower than one star,"I have been a great Pat Metheny fan for several years. I prefer his 'Group' vs. 'Trio' or solos. He would sometimes go off on a solo at a concert, but not as bad as this CD. THIS IS EXTREMELY AWFUL NOISE! PURE GARBAGE!"
4,Monarch Adventure,This is the kind of video I wish I had been exposed to when I was 10. Now I am catching up on what I've missed over 50+ years.Well done!
4,Educational tool,Enlightening and entertaining documentary about the Monarch butterfly. Beautiful footage of the Monarch's over-wintering site where millions of butterflies spend the cold season. Great general information. Buy it for your kids!
2,"not ""hard core"" enough for my pup","our dog got this and went chewing right at the black stitching and got it ripped open in 10 minutes..we took it away...gave it to her again a few days later she went right after the black stitching on the other side in 10 minutes..she is 85 lb 2 year old lab...what can we say..she is too hard core for this ""hard core"" toy...it is OK but did not last nor was strong enough to be worth buying again...do not be fooled by claims of ""indestructible"" or ""chew proof"""
2,not for rottweilers,my rottie chewed it open in about 20 minutes and that makes it not useful for me- i need tuff dog toys
2,Didn't meet my expectations.,"The red portion of this product IS pretty tough, however, my boxer pup went right for the ends and started gnawing away at the black seems. Within 40 minutes the corner was frayed and I had to remove the plastic squeaker from the toy. I'm glad I paid attention and didn't assume that the toy was stronger than it was, as my dog could have EASILY swallowed and choked on the plastic.With a name like ""Hard Core Fire Hose toy"", I thought that I was getting a TOUGH and lasting toy. I was wrong.I do agree with a previous commentor who said this makes a great 'fetch' toy. As long as you keep taking it away from your dog and making a game out of it, it should last for a long, long time.Tony,Allentown, PA"
2,Not very strong or durable at all,"I've yet to find a soft dog toy that my Springer Spaniel won't destroy. I bought a few of these hoping they would work. My dog did love them, but he had the first one shredded within minutes of me giving it to him. It's not like I have some supper dog - he's only 45 pounds, but he had no problem chewing right through them.If you're dog isn't a big chewer then these would be a good toy, but if he chews through everything you've given him - this will be no different."
1,Thought I was buying something tough...,You call this toy tough? My puppy destroyed this in about an hour. Our quest for the indestructable dog toy continues.
4,a great guide which is even great beach reading!,"Not only does this book have all the up-to-date information about cheap but good places to stay and eat, it also has very interesting cultural tidbits. I referred to this book on our Greek Isle trip quite frequently and I was hardly ever disapointed. We took their advice and found the best food we've ever eaten in a little town on the island of Tinos. This restaurant grows their own vegetables, milks their own goats, and of course has the requisite cat or two hanging around. I have to say just finding that one restaurant was worth the price of the book. That said, I thought it could have been a little more detailed and included more out of the way type places. I even used this book as beach reading one day (interspersed with Edith Wharton's ""The House of Mirth"" -- great book!) and found the sections on Greek history and culture to be engrossing and helpful!"
4,True Perspective on Life & Running,"Roger Bannister sets about telling the story of his historic record 4 minute mile but in the process he reveals that there is more to life than just running. This book is quite unlike most running books I have read in that Bannister strives to keep things in perspective amid spectacular and historic events. It could just be his British demeanor, but I found narrative rather enjoying."
1,The sound is completely different,This doesn't sound like the Hooverphonic of the previous 3 albums at all. I'm not sure what it is. Just what it isn't. It isn't the old Hooverphonic. I didn't like any of the tracks at all. It's just not my kind of music.
4,Excellent but not unsurpassed,"These are splendid performances and are made more enjoyable by being on Blu-Ray. It's very difficult to be subjective about a Chopin interpretation; one can dissect it clinically note by note and comment on its accuracy but this can be misleading. Chopin seldom played his pieces the same way twice so any directions on the score can only be suggestive. The beauty of Chopin lies between the notes so a listener hears what he hears which may not be what another person hears. As I say, these are very good interpretations but in my view a bit over sentimental. I prefer the Kristian Zimmerman Performances. To me they are so fresh and spontaneous and I never get tired of listening to them.Sorry I can't be more definitive."
5,RZA BEATS,"ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT I BOUGHT THE CD AS SOON AS IT CAME OUT, AND WENT TO BED LISTENING TO IT. IN THE MORNING I HAD THIS DEADLY TRUMPET BEAT STUCK IN MY HEAD, AND IT TOOK ME A WHILE BEFORE I FIGURED OUT IT WAS THE BEAT FOR ""BREAK BREAD"". THE LYRICS FOR THE TRACK ARE NOT TOO IMPRESSIVE, BUT THE BEAT IS ONE OF THE BEST EVER, ALMOST LIKE THE VIOLIN IN REUNITED, OR THE VIOLIN AT THE END OF HOLOCAUST'S SMOKING ROOM. DEADLY. THE FIRST RZA AS BOBBY DIGITAL IN STEREO IS DEFINITELY BETTER"
1,coughing and hacking trio,"Just purchased these cds based on above review that advises,to paraphrase,' although a live performance the audience was silent.' Not so, sounds like a hospital ward. This is a real shame as the performance is good, but upon listening to this cd several times the enjoyment diminishes. Where can I get my money back?"
5,"The best phone for this price,","Very happy with the phone, the most features you can get than any other phone out there."
1,Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,"Do not purchase this phone system unless you enjoy the sound of ""white noise"" during telephone conversations. There is a constant hissing noise from the ear piece whenever the phone is being used . . . Please take heed to similiar reviews on this phone and save yourself the hassle and expense of having to return it !"
3,AHHH DARN,i ordered this ring and it wasnt as shiny as i thought it would be. and it only fits my pinky. but the shipping was pretty fast.
2,Inept audio engineering and often unintelligible lyrics,"A studio recording with badly placed or balanced microphones, wandering sound levels that either deafen you or require your hearing aid from moment to moment, and typical ""operatic"" singers delivering lyrics that are often unintelligible although allegedly in English. Fine voices and orchestra, I guess."
1,worthless battery,"This product worked for less than two weeks and then quit. I emailed for advice no response.... I sent it back on June 26, 2010 for a refund... I received, no confirmation that it was received... will not buy another product this way again..."
4,"Real world conditions, maybe barely watch a 2 hour movie...","The battery is indistinguishable from the OEM battery it replaces. My old battery was close to 400 charge cycles and would last me maybe 20 minutes on a full charge. The new battery, after a couple of full discharge/full charge conditioning cycles typically gets me a little less than 2 hours to the low charge warning. If one is willing to reduce screen brightness and switch the processor to its energy saving mode, I know the battery would last longer. However, running the processor on energy saving mode also reduces performance, and I noticed that YouTube videos were jerky in this mode. So, in a real world situation, don't expect hours and hours of use out of a charge. I'm only slightly disappointed, as I'm fairly certain that my real world experience with this battery is not far off from most other battery choices out there for the 17"" Aluminum Powerbook. That's alot of real estate to light up!"
2,"OK for step stool, not great for bathtime","I love multipurpose kids' stuff. I feel like it helps reduce the clutter in my house.Unfortunately, the primary use I bought this for was kneeling by the tub to help my son take a bath, and it puts me up so high I have to lean over too far to reach him. That means I'm choosing between my knees and my back.I thought it would be easier once he was sitting up in the tub. Not so.Also the pads for the feet fall out constantly. It's hard to keep track of them sometimes.I'll keep it around for a step stool when my little one starts potty training and brushing his own teeth."
1,"Purchased on-line, no weight limit listed","My post baby weight was over 200lbs, if you are over 200 lbs, this is not for you. I was only a few pounds over that so I thought ""it will be safe"". Err! Wrong answer, I cracked the kneeler portion. What a blow to the postpartum ego."
5,Bernstein Tchaikovsky,"In 1975, I saw the Live From Lincoln Center broadcast on PBS featuring the works of Tchaikovsky and have always considered it to be best program of any kind I have ever seen on television. I have waited over thirty years to see it again. It is just as I rembered it."
3,unworthy issue,"There seems to be an ""effortless"" work in playing these pieces but that doesn't make them shine at all. Although Pletnev's legato is clean he can't rely on harmony and it sounds pretty much al the same. This particular SACD sound isn't the best also."
1,Classic Gem,"I had the good fortune to see this band at a festival in the early 70'sThe material on this album is as interesting as it was then--My personal favorite is ""Tomorrow Night""--Old Hippee music is still enjoyable in this age of digital tunes, and these guys used quite a few gizmos that were available in their day--talk about Jammin' on the Hammond!!!"
4,An unheralded classic,"There was so much good much in the sixties and early seventies that it's not surprising some wonderful albums and even groups are now largely forgotten. Atomic Rooster is one such group and ""Death Walks Behind You"" was their best studio album. It was influential in the rise of heavy metal, was one of the best albums for taking advantage of separate stereo channels (listen for the guitars to cross over each other from one end of the room to the other), and is laden with great songs. Highly recommended"
2,Standardized beauty,"2 1/2Not an entirely unsuccessful disc of pop-rock from these sensitive Swedes, but one that feels oppressively boxed in by a wealth of predictable patterns and mid-tempo mush, whereas only the smallest fraction of melodies sneak past generic, mainly within the last few tracks."
3,Work but unnecessary,"Sure, it's very convenient to have to gel right inside the razor, but it can get expensive to constantly have to buy more of these packs. I use regular shaving gel with my Cool Skin shaver and have never had a problem in the two years I have used it. I still use the packs when traveling, just for the space savings."
1,Use lotion instead,"The razor I bought came with packets of this gel, as well as the lotion. Possibly due to the consistency, the gel gets used up more quickly. It is also not as comfortable to use as the lotion is.The key ingredient that makes the difference is menthol. The gel has menthol, so that's why it can be irritating. I read a review of shaving basics online, and it says always avoid shaving with products containing menthol. The lotion, on the other hand, always helps get a better shave, and is quite soothing."
1,pure self indulgent garbage,"SOMEONE PLEASE STOP THOMAS HAMPSON, BEFORE HE HURTS HIMSELF...OR HURTS THE REST OF US....What a collective piece of trash this album is?..is there a more self-important, bloated, indulgent, precious, affected, pompous singer on the planet?...i am waiting for Thomas Hampson sings Disco...or Thomas Hampson sings Elton John...or Thomas Hampson does Eminem?...he probably thinks he could pull 'em off...what unmitigated gaul...don't waste your money here"
2,Well written but can we say rambling and slow???,"This book has no point! George Eliot was a great author and wrote it really well, but seems not to have put any sparkle in it! I'm being forced to read this in high-school and it is the dumbest thing I have ever read. If you want to find out about English life in that time, this book is worth a glance, but don't pay for it.just borrow from the library. Oh, and fix the adult form!!!!!! I'm 16 and can't login."
1,DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!,"Ok, I cant take it when people are like ""ahh, its beautifuly written, and..."" spare me! I love books like Timeline, or The Great Gatsby. NOT Silas Marner! This book is soooo RIDICULOUSLY slow, it baffles me. I just barley could read it during my senior year. I struggled so hard to get it done! If you feel the need to read this for fun, do not do it! I am forwarning you. It is by far the worst, most boring book ever written."
4,Excellent read,"Enjoyed her very explicit writing, beautifully plotted, I could envisage the characters.I now will tackle Adam Bede.The countryside was imaginable"
2,Scribbles thruout,"This book was purchased used; however, the numerous scribbles and highlighting thruout the book was not listed in the description."
4,It teaches you what it says on the cover!,"This book does exactly what it promises. It teaches basic perspective. When I was learning to draw comic books this book was a godsend. It explains the basics with superb accompanying illustrations and easy to follow text.If you need to learn the basics of perspective, this book is for you. At only 48 pages it's a little pricey, which cost it the extra star, but as they say, knowledge is priceless. Treat this as a primer for more advanced perspective study, and you'll be delighted. 'Basic Perspective for Comics and Illustration' delivers the goods.You can't ask more than that!"
1,Weak,"This book is far too contrived for its own good. In trying to make some sort of point about the individual capacity for violence and sex, Stuart creates a silly plot with some totally over the top characters. The plot circles around a London movie producer who is trying to make a masterpiece movie based on an ultraviolent play about warring soccer hooligan gangs. Along the way he falls in love with a crew member and hires a hooligan (presumably a skinhead of sorts) to be a driver. Much is made of how little difference there is between the upper class producer and the lower class thug. For some reason Stuart chose not to use real soccer teams in his narrative, which only further hinders the book. It really reads as if the author is basing a lot of his notions of what he has read and heard about, rather than seen. A novel which covers the theme of violence much better and realistically is John King's The Football Factory."
4,A fine example of Sellers' brilliance!,"The songs and sketches of this disc showcase Peter Sellers' vast range of vocal characterizations, from ""Goon Show"" regulars Bluebottle and Willum ""Mate"" Cobblers, to Dr. Strangelove, to a dead-on impression of Laurence Olivier as Richard III. Included on this disc are Sellers' twisted takes on ""Hard Day's Night,"" ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" ""All the Things You Are,"" ""Wouldn't It Be Loverly?"" and Purcell's ""Trumpet Voluntary."" Hearing Bluebottle sing ""Unchained Melody"" was worth the price of the disc alone.The only thing holding me back to four stars was the lack of any liner notes. Apart from copyright dates on the individual tracks, there is nothing here to tell us anything about the history of these recordings. Still, Sellers fans should enjoy this disc immensely."
2,I guess all that glitters isnt gold,"I bought this for my husband a while back and shortly thereafter, this man (Minister) was arrested for beating his wife. My husband started reading the book and liked what he was reading so far, but has put it down, never picked it up and has lost respect. It's hard to listen to someone trying to encourage you when they were arrested for beating up their wife."
3,Finding Their Feet,"These were early days for Y&T. Although there are a few good songs on this album, most are forgettable. If anything, this album is not as strong as the debut. However, the seeds were being sown for the glorious albums to follow, and these signs are there on this record. Dave Meniketti's voice and guitar playing are in place, as is Leonard Haze's solid drumming. That is why it is such a pleasure to own this CD - to have a chance to hear a great band in development. So - this CD is for hardcore Y&T fans only - but if you are one, this is an essential purchase."
5,a 1st class childs view on war torn britain.,"as previous reviews have mentioned, this is a first rate novel from one of britain top childrens authors, now sadly deceased. It highlights some of Westall's own experiences in war torn tyne and wear - an idea born from his own son (who many of Westall's books are based on - in memorium), when asked by him to stop a leaking roof on the den/base his son and friends had built. Westall states that he felt extremely priveliged to have been invited into their secret world.(hence the den in the book). a very detailed account for those interested in ww2 britain - right down to shrapnel collections found under hedges, to chrysanthemums for christmas. an excellent read, and a book adopted by many schools for english tutoring. This is his best and first book, but try secret lovers, a collection of short stories, and in particular Blind Bill."
4,Ecological Liver Extract,"very good pure product...Hard to find in capsules.. decent price, but wish it were cheaper.Probably would buy it again."
1,Not What I Wanted,"I was very disappointed in this movie. I nearly fell asleep. I expected this to be a great movie talking about all the accomplishments in Keller's life, but it obviously was different."
3,Not a Reissue of the Original,"Had the original vinyl, also a 1991 release CD of 'Against the Grain'. Those two were the original versions, this has a different cover and different takes of the same songs(plus the xtra trax). Couple other folks commented on this as well and they are right. It is interesting in that it is different versions of the familiar tunes, but I don't think it should be marketed as the 'original remastered/reissued' or whatever. There should be some notation/clarification about this. Truth in advertising . . . ? Basically, not what I thought I was buying."
4,high quality gloves,I purchased these gloves to replace a pair that I had used for many years. The gloves are well constructed and provide good protection.
1,Piece of junk,The Batteries were half dead the screen on one that i purchased did not work they did not preform the tasks described in the outline. The construction and overall feel has terrible STAY AWAY... Franklin TES-118 English/Spanish Translator
1,Save your money,"I'd love to know how they figure in excess of 500,000 translations, Virtually every effort to translate a word came up ""Correcting"" and after a considerable time offered unrelated suggestions. Possibly of some use to absolute beginners, however at any level above this if you don't know the translation, then almost certainly this thing won't either."
4,Garmin A/C Adapter,"Helpful to have StreetPilot charged up, bought for our daughter so she & her friends could use her Garmin StreetPilot ready to go in any of their cars without needing the battery connection, which is an awkward wire in some cars."
3,"Less B&W, more color needed","Walk around books are supposed to be mostly in color...I can see a few B&W; photos to show interesting war time shot, but 28 pages of this book are in B&W...and; most of those are of restored/museum aircraft.The color photos that are included are excellent. You do get to see the entire plane, engine, cockpit, wheel wells, structure of the plane. My favorite pages were the 3-d drawings that showed how the engine cowl and machine gun ammo doors opened and armament system. 4 pages of color plates to show the camouflage schemes and what RAL colors were used (very helpful to modelers).A good book, but not up to the usual standards of other walk arounds I have. Got this on deep discount, so am not too disappointed."
1,Not as good as they say,"The OO concepts are explained well and the balloon idea is good but the information isn't very deep and there's some useless material on methodology. For a better book on methodology and OO (and UML) see Craig Larman's popular ""Applying UML & Patterns"", the second edition of which just recently became available."
5,The best Java book ever read....,I quite agree with all the reviewers. She did a good job in explaining the basic concept and follow with a sample SRS application. I believe the best way to learn programming is practise with examples.I give her 10 stars **********
5,Great OO Book,Buy this book if- you are a programmer comfortable with procedural methods who has been frustrated understanding the OO paradigm- you enjoy designing your projects rather than just hackingIt is a pleasant and instructive read.
3,An okay dose of inspiration in small doses,"I passed this up a couple of times in the book store because it looked a little too simplified. I was back in a month or so ago headed to the hospital so thought what the hey, give it a try. It is a Readers Digest compilation by a Covey associate and then Covey sets up the sections and comments on their value. It certainly isnt bad, it starts out with a few strong stories then I began to lose interest. I am not using it probably as it was intended, as a book for small doses of inspiration and not intended to be read cover to cover. If you like short inspirational stories, literally right out of Readers Digest, then this is the book."
4,Timeless Collection for Everyone,"""Everyday Greatness"" is a superb collection of the most inspirational stories and quotes ever printed in the ""Reader's Digest"" magazine. What makes this volume unique is the commentary by Stephen R. Covey that follows after each story. Here he briefly summarizes each essay, offers personal insights, and encourages the reader to reflect on some thought provoking questions.This collection of stories both challenged and inspired me. I learned a number of valuable lessons (including ones about love, humility, and living a simplified life) which I have applied to my own life. One of my favorite quotes is by Edith Wharton, ""there are two ways of spreading light; to be the candle or the mirror reflecting it."" This book has definitely inspired me to be both.I would definitely recommend ""Everyday Greatness"". It is a book I think everyone should own and use throughout the years. It truly is a timeless collection.I'm a Thomas Nelson Book Review Blogger."
3,Review: Everyday Greatness a Reader's Digest Book,"""Everyday Greatness"" is chock full of Stephen R. Covey's ""Insights and Commentary!"" In this, he has not written the book, he simply has commented and given his insight on the selections compiled by David K. Hatch. They are great and inspirational topics. It is more like a coffee table book, large and full of titles like Respect, Gratitude, Integrity, Discipline, and more.The book is enjoyable and has great quotes for those who enjoy meaningful quotes as well. The authors are well chosen and Covey gives a great commentary that is motivational and inspirational."
2,"I wanna meet the 9 year olds that wrote this movie! Bad, But not GoodBad!","Some of these cheezy ""B"" movies are so bad, they are funny without trying to be. MS vs GO is not one of these. There were a few moments that got a chuckle, usually from the really bad computer graphics, or poor location choices (The San Francisco International Airport is nowhere near a beach....which was supposed to be Half Moon Bay...really bad with locations here) or the bad military graphics...When Mega Shark is flanking the destroyer, tiny explosions are seen coming from the boats guns, which are not even raised shooting straight forward. I was also amazing how 99% of the Japanese actors spoke perfect American/English. Not that I was expecting realism here...Doesn't anybody look at these mistakes while editing or making the movie.This movie could have been made by an elementary school video class. Debbie Gibson did an okay job, as did her Japanese love interest, but that ""Irish"" guy....what a bozo!"
1,Worst Special Effects EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Just watched this ""movie"" on SyFy Channel. I will never get that 2 hours back. There are some very poor movie shots of USS Missouri (BB-63), which is identified as a ""destroyer."" The commanding officer of this destroyer is a Submariner, not a surface sailor (not in my navy). Later they show a foreign Frigate and identify it as another US Destroyer, once again a submarine CO. Did the writer, producer, director, ever even hear of the US Navy. let alone interface with it? Since when does the Modern US Navy run submarines in ""Wolf Packs?""Alright, enough about the Navy Bloopers. Dialog, special effects, script, and everything else is just a waste of time. Read a book, take a nap, get drunk, just do not waste time on this farce! Worst movie of the century award should be given. This movie makes me long for the old ""B"" Movies of the 60's."
2,Once only,"This is one of those movies you can say you've seen once, and that's enough. Fuzzy images and short of FX....could have been much better this movie fails to impress. Title picture is misleading. Yes we know the critter is in the water, and we actually to get to see a cruise ship, but the actual attack with the ship being pulled under is presumably off screen as the movie flashes to the next scene."
1,I'd Rather Have Cancer,"We rented this movie-knowing it would be cheesy. Boy were we way off. This is the WORST movie *EVER* made, and saying that, know that I am a HUUUGE Deborah Debbie Gibson fan, and even still, I couldn't stand this movie no matter how many drinks I had. I'm so glad I didn't buy it but mad that I spent 3.99 st Blockbuster renting it. I would rather have my hands slammed in a car door, then be kneed in the groin and then have salt spilled in open wounds than to se this moive again. No plot, bad acting---even the SHARK had bad acting. I'm ashamed to be a Debbie Gibon fan."
1,Pathetic,"Couldn't pay me $18.49 to own this. If you want Hollywood to up the quality level of movie entertainment, please don't endorse something that is obviously such trash.Watching a documentary on how & why this movie was made would have more redeeming qualities and probably be alot more interesting."
5,Very pleased!,I bought these to go along with the children's set. I thought it would be nice to have adult size cups to go along with her set for me to use as well as for her as she got older. Then she would always be able to use it no matter what age she was. I am very pleased with it. I love how each cup is different in shape and color.
1,doesn't hold any charge at all. no use,"I charged it for at least 12 hours and try it on my cannon but it doesn't work. It doesn't hold any charge at all, useless."
5,The best shave I have had with an electric shaver!,The Norelco rotary shaver that dispensed HQ170 as it shaved my face provided the smoothest electric shave that I have ever had. I have sensitive skin and found the lotion left my face feeling smooth and not raw as I had felt after using a Remington reciprocating cutter.I tried the HQ171 Gel but it was slightly irritant and did not smooth the shaver heads over the skin like the lotion did.
5,GOOD LOTION MUST HAVE FOR THIS SHAVER,THIS SHAVER WILL NOT GIVE A COMFORTABLE SHAVE WITHOUT THE LOTION DISPENSER. FEEL ROUGH AND NOT SMOOOTH. LOTION IS 1.00 A TUBE AND LAST ABOUT 15 SHAVE WHICH IS A GOOD VALUE...
5,Works well,"this product works well for me. Too bad it didn't also come in a bottle like other pre shave lotions. I use it most of the time as I've been in a hurry at times and use my Norelco shaver dry, but I like it with the lotion better. Shower shaving is nice too. The steam in the shower helps set up my beard. All in all it's very convenient for travel too. I recomend it highly."
1,Faulty,"Disappointing! At first glance this book does have lots potential in terms of simplifying concepts and formulas, but it is loaded with mistakes - not only in the answer sections, but also regarding some of the methods. I applied their ""Method for Finding Square Roots"" to numbers other than the given examples, and it did not work. This is not a good buy - even if one merely needs a refresher in math."
2,Not as advertised,"The item was advertised as like new, the slip cover and the booklet were missing, the jewel case was damaged, disappointed."
5,My daughter loves this series,"My daughter is a 7 year old second-grader and she loves the Pixie Tricks series. She has read the first three books and can't wait to start the fourth. The books are at the perfect level for her to read herself. Violet is a wonderful main character -- fun, bright, adventurous, thoughtful. The plots are so exciting my daughter can't put the books down. She begs for me to let her stay up and read another chapter. We lent Sprite's Secret to a 7 year old neighbor and she loved it too.I'm not sure if the books appeal to boys. But if you have a daughter who loves fairies or any ""magical"" stories, I highly recommend the Pixie Tricks series."
1,Don't waste your money,We have only had it for a few days now and the keyboard never properly attached to the legs. The seat keeps falling off its legs and the microphone is broken. Don't waste your money.
2,Broken on Christmas Day,"My 2 1/2 year old loved this toy. Within 2 hours on Christmas morning the microphone broke. I called customer service and I need to send them a photo of the part that's broken but I have a feeling it's going to be the same thing when I get it back. It was made poorly. My little guy still likes it but I'm just annoyed that it broke that quickly. I think I'll take it back and get something that is made better.Also, the sound control is awful! When you turn on the demo play it blasts the music. He came running in crying because it hurts his ears. The volume can be turned down but resets itself after every demo play. Really annoying and scary.Don't buy this toy. We're probably going to take it back."
2,Broken almost out of the box,"The microphone stand broke at the joint the first time a kid over the age of three touched it. I would rather visit the dentist for a root canal than have to deal with Kids Station customer service again. There is no way to order the part online or over the phone - requests have to be sent in in writing, even for non-warranty replacements. The customer service department is unhelpful and extremely hostile. Little Tykes should seriously consider refusing to license any more Kids Station products until A) they become durable enough to withstand kids playing with them, or B) Kids Station gets their act together regarding their customer service.The microphone stand is poorly designed - it has ratcheting teeth that tighten to the point that a 5-year-old girl attempting to adjust the microphone stand managed to snap the stand in half before the teeth ratcheted."
3,GREAT KEYBOARD-STAND USELESS,"THIS WAS GIVEN TO MY 3 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER BY HER SISTER FOR CHRISTMAS. THE MICROPHONE BROKE PUTTING IT TOGETHER. I COULDN'T FIND RECIEPT SO CUSTOMER SERVICE MADE ME PAY 5.00 TO SEND A NEW ONE WHICH TOOK ABOUT 8 WEEKS!! CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NOT THROUGH LITTLE TIKES WHICH EXPLAINS THE POOR SERVICE WE GOT, NOT TO MENTION THAT THE CUSTOMER SERV. REP. ACCUSSED ME OF HAVING IT FOR MONTHS AND JUST WANTING TO GET A NEW MICROPHONE. THE STAND IS USELESS IF YOU MOVE IT THE BOTTOM COMES APART OVER AND OVER AND OVER!!!HOWEVER, MY LITTLE GIRL DOES LOVE THE KEYBOARD WITH ALL THE DIFFERRENT MELODIES AND THE FLASHING LIGHTS ETC.. SHE LOVES SINGING AND I LIKE THAT IT MAKES HER HAPPY UNTIL THE BASE COMES APART AT THE BOTTOM. IT HAS A CARRY HANDLE (TO BE USED WITH OUT BASE) BUT IT IS A BIT BULKY FOR LITTLE HANDS TO CARRY AROUND. I SAY THE COMPANY NEEDS TO IMPROVE THE STAND/BASE ON THIS PRODUCT."
2,Broken Mic and Mic Stand,"Agree with all other reviews. Kid enjoys the keyboard but also gets frustrated when the glued together mic stand breaks again and again...the mic itself only works intermittently...this also causes frustration. This would get a 1 star but because she enjoys it for the brief moments that it works and before the mic stand collapses, I am generously giving 2 stars."
3,Love Keyboard but Mic broken,"We ordered this for our 3 year old's birthday, because she fell in love with one that her 5 year old friend got for his birthday a few months earlier. The problem we have is that the mic did not work from the beginning. When I called the friend's mom to ask about her mic working, she said it stopped working within a few minutes of playing too. We have decided not to pack it back up and send it back to Amazon due to how much our 3 year old loves the rest of it, but buyer beware!"
1,I give this toy --- zero --- stars,"This toy is cheap, easily breakable and DEFINITELY not worth the money. Little Tikes should be ashamed to put its name on it."
1,A piece of junk!,"My 3 year old only had the toy a matter of hours before it fell over and the microphone stand broke. Wrote company, which isn't Little Tikes, for a replacement. Received it but it didn't fit. Also you had to put the batteries in carefully otherwise it didn't work. Worst toy that we have ever bought."
3,"Good Concept, Poor Quality","How can Little Tikes attach their name to such a horribly cheap product? The plastic is not at all like the durable stuff that Little Tikes uses. The screw on the microphone does not stay in, so the microphone holder is always open and loose. And as for the miniature sized screw on the battery compartment, good luck finding a Phillips head small enough to open the easily-stripped screw that was really meant for eyeglass earpieces. The base of the unit is too small, so the top-heavy keyboard tips over easily. This product is like an American car. Great idea, poor craftsmanship. Sadly, my 3-yr old daughter loves ""playing the piano"", so I just have to be close by to pick it up/put it together every time it falls apart. Boo, Little Tikes."
1,Agree with all the others - do not buy this toy,"Wow, was I surprised when I got on-line to purchase a new mike stand, which broke almost immediatly, only to find everybody else had the exact same problem.What a rip off.Also, poor quality sound - too scratchy and loud. I really wish we'd read the reviews on this toy before buying (we saw it in the store and fell so in love with it we bought it before doing our homework). Mistake!"
1,Very Disappointed in the Quality,"My daughter received this toy for Christmas. It was great for 4 months -- she loved it. Then it just died. When I called for assistance I was told that the warranty was only for 90 days and I'd have to pay to have the toy shipped to them as well as any parts/labor etc. (approximately 10 - 15 dollars for the part alone)I can't believe that they feel they (Kidstation -- not Toys r Us) can charge close to $40 for a toy they can only warrant for 90 days. Shouldn't we be getting better quality?For as much as my daughter loves this toy, it's killing me to not get her another one but I refuse to buy anything else manufactured by Kidstation.And on top of the poor quality of the toy -- the customer service rep was rude as well."
3,Great Product,"For the price this is truely a great product, works well for me. I was disappointed that this comes without the cables."
5,Liquid Silk Delivers,"My wife and I searched high and low to find the perfect lube. Liquid Silk won the day! I can't recommend this enough, it cleans up easy and has great staying power."
3,Not what I was looking for,"There is nothing wrong with this book, it was just not what I was looking for. I was looking for a book that might aid in the development of my table tennis game. I was looking for specific drills to improve my play and consistency. I would not recommend this book if this is what you are looking for."
3,"""Snowflakes in Photographs"" just a dusting compared to ""Snow Crystals""","""Snowflakes in Photographs"" is a beautiful book with some history on Bentley and his photography; featuring stunning black and white photographs of snowflakes. Ironically however, the book ""Snow Crystals"" (also published by Dover) contains a great deal more text and more than twice the number of photographs than this book ""Snowflakes in Photographs"". I bought the two books at the same time thinking that other one focused more on Bentley and this one focused more on the pictures but it was a mistake. This is a case of ""you get what you pay for"" and the only reason to buy this one is that it is a bit cheaper than the other. On it's own, this book is still a smaller but nice collection of photographs without much 'text' support."
4,Beautiful book,"I bought this book hoping the kids (8&5) would be intrigued by all the patterns of the snowflakes. They weren't, but the adults loved it!The photography and the story of the how these snowflakes were captured on film is very interesting."
4,eye-opener,"Over a half a century ago (how's that again?) thisbook informed me of a human trait that I had neverknown existed.It might even today be a sensitiveintroduction for some who decry,perhaps to the pointof denial,that it does exist.A correction to your review. The lead characters werenot lesbians, as I recall. They were young men."
5,The Moffatts is the best in my life,The Moffatts is the best in my life. I had buy their singles and all of their albums thats are great. I like all of the soundtrack. A little bit I had heard the music just like The Beatles the group that i like when I was 3 years old. Well they all do to the great job. I hope I would see they soon.
1,too small,"these new aquaclear 110 foam appear at least an inch smaller than the chamber dimension. i like most of my Hagen product, but so disappointed with this one. hope they will make the adjustment to the size so they can fit better or i have to look for alternative solution for my filters."
2,It was just an OK,"The ""customer"" who reviewed this book said it better than I can. Jasmine said, no, no, no, no, no then yes, yes then no again! She kept getting herself in stupid, silly, dangerous situations where Falcon had to fly to her rescue. Then she still said no. He was ready for sex on most pages of the book. It got boring & then it was trivialized. I own the second book in the series. I'm not sure I even want to give it a try."
3,The Falcon and the Flower,This book was good. I bought two of her books to see how good she was and I would read more. She may be a little too graphic but not enough to be offensive. Theres a lot of attempted incest stuff that I could do without but other then that it was well written and entertaining.
5,The most compelling romance ever,"I feel that this book has talent and emotion all in one. I have read it at least 15 times, and every time it is like I have never read it before. I loved how Virginia has captured truth, and other fantisy in this book. Everthing from Robin Hood, to King John, and Young Arthur. The wemon in the book are wemon who could survive in todays world, with their firery tempers, and their sence of independence. I think any woman can agree that Falcon de Burgh could make any woman act the way Jasmine, Morganna, and the Countess of Warwick did. I recomend this book to anyone."
2,Siemens Gigaset,"This phone has some very nice features including but not limited to the ability to add up to eight handsets. However, the battery life on both the NI cad and NIMH batteries are terrible. I find this phone more often in the charger than anywhere else. In addition the range is certainly not what I expected out of a 2.4 ghrz system, in fact my 900 Mhz digital has more range. I even have trouble getting a good signal in my back yard. The features are amazing but the standard performance is very poor. I would recommend waiting to purchase when these bugs are worked out"
1,Do not buy this phone.,Nothing but trouble with the Siemens system. Inconsistent sound quality -- cuts out. Also recharger malfunction. Returned one handset for another that would not hold a charge.
3,beware DSL - good otherwise,The Siemens 2402 is a mix of outstanding and truly frustrating features. I almost returned it as it totally disabled my DSL connection. I fixed that by putting a DSL line filter in (Radio Shack). I had to mount it in the middle of the house to make it reach from end-to-end. Very questionable range claims. Multiple handsets are very cool. Ability to take a headset is great.
2,"Neat Features, poor handsets","I've had this system for over a year with mixed results. If you read the manuals, you can access a feature set that is rich and functional. If you are non-technical, you'll have problems as the menu system is not intuitive. In short, no problem for gadget freaks, but our spouses won't fare as well.The system has been susceptible to interference and range limitations. The handsets have a noticable delay and/or non response to pressing keys (all 5 of my handsets, not just a problem unit). This is especially problematic for children and potential emergency situations with 911. We're replacing our system."
3,One very big drawback,"Two CD's worth of material, and they use the DRAMATICALLY EDITED version of ""Total Eclipse of the Heart""?????? It was the biggest hit of her career! And they use the FULL-LENGTH version of ""Faster Than the Speed of Night,"" which in my opinion should have been edited instead. This does NOT make me a happy camper.Oh well...aside from that, it's a great collection and the most extensive one I've found so far. The sound quality is superb. The lead-off track, ""My! My! Honeycomb,"" was Bonnie's first record and is a great tune.This collection has extensive liner notes and plenty of Bonnie pics, although some of them leave a bit to be desired as far as quality.I'm going to keep the songs I want from this disc and then sell it."
4,Old West action,"""Gun"" is a very solid western game with ""grand theft auto"" style freedom to choose your missions and what you want to do. It has a great storyline, outstanding voice acting, smooth gameplay and very good graphics. Unfortunately, the game also feels a little too short and it never quite maximizes the western landscape. Some of the side missions will take you out into the country but a lot of the territory doesn't have much to do with anything. Overall, this is a very good game and well worth your time. The fact that it leaves you wanting more probably says something about how good the gameplay is."
2,"""It's over already?""","I'm going to keep this short because the game doesn't deserve a review longer than the actual game play. great idea, tons of fun, addictive, and SHORT. my only complaint, just when i was digging the game, i beat it. alittle disappointing, definitely worth $20, just make sure you have something else to do after you beat it."
5,could I take it?,"As a pilot from WWII I was fortunate that I did not find myself in the 8th Air Forcebombing runs over Germany and this book tells why with real impact.The anxiety of waiting for one's name to be up for tomorrow's mission , the sheer terror of the mission itself ,the empty bunks in quarters after a mission-emotions which pull you from one page to the next."
4,Good Breakthrough Effort,"If you like contemporary Dancehall music you won't regret picking up this album. Its fun to listen to, with the megahit ""Gimme The Light"" as the centerpiece. But I wouldn't buy an album unless it has at least four wicked tracks. ""Like Glue"", ""Concrete"", ""Can You Do The Work"", ""My Name"" and ""Punkie"" more than qualifies it. ""Street Respect"", ""Esa Loca"" with Tony Touch and his Spanish remix of ""Punkie"" are good too. The surprising disappointment was the Neptunes-produced track.I still think his first album Stage One was slightly better but this one is defintitely worth getting. This could be the beginning of a very fruitful career."
4,Breaks the mold,"'Dutty Rock' doesn't disappoint. The 'Gimme the Light' and 'Get Busy' are not the only songs you'll enjoy, trust me. 'International Affair', 'Like Glue', 'Street Respect', and especially 'Esa Loca' are my favorites. A great album to jam to, it has a lot of beats that'll get you movin'. Unlike a lot of rap/hip-hop albums, it being edited doesn't result in two words and then five seconds of silence over and over again. You don't even really notice that it's edited, with the exception of the original 'Gimme the Light'. They change ""pass the dro"" to ""start the show"" which just ruins the whole vibe. Thankfully, they left that part untouched on the remix with Busta Rhymes. I would recommend going ahead and getting the PA version just for 'Gimme the Light', unless you're really apprehensive about the material. And don't worry, even if you don't fully understand what he's saying at first, you'll pick it up after a few listens."
4,No sophmore jinx,"Sean-a-paul keeps it dancehall on Dutty Rock, unlike other dancehall artists whose had hype about their albums. The few tracks that Sean co-stars with rappers don't work to well (especially Esa Loca with Tony Touch). Top songs aside from ""Gimme the light"" include ""Punkie"", which I can't get tired of,""I'm Still In Love With You"", a chillin track, and ""Can You Do The Work"". If your a dancehall fan, or if you curious of what the dancehall craze is all about, get this CD."
4,good,I don't know how people can not like this cd. It's really good. I literally love every song on it. Seriously buy it.
1,What a piece of junk!,"Looks like an ipod, doesn't work like one. Stop fronting like I did and get the real thing."
2,"2 1/2"" Blades Slip","Ok FEIN, when are you going to eliminate blade slippage by upgrading the design of the drive pattern from the current Round to a Star drive? It is my opinion that you are too slow in responding to customer requests to improve the drive design and I reluctantly returned my unit because of frequent slippage. All of you newer blades have the Star drive but the power head still relies on compression, thus friction by the washer and bolt to hold the blade in place. Your current solution is an adapter, which is nothing more than a washer that has sandpaper like surface/carbide particles to increase the friction. Not an acceptable solution for and expensive tool.When you finally get around to improving the design, I will purchase a machine again but I will definitely wait until the new design is released."
1,"I Love Cris Rice, but!",I only wanted this CD for one song that I was told was on this CD and it wasn't. I wanted Cartoons and was very dissapointed when it wasn't on the CD
4,You'll want to know more about Chris Rice after listening...,"If ""Power of a Moment"" was the only song on this album, it would still be worth picking up. Fortunately, it's not the only good song. The humble and sensitive ""Nave"" is a beautiful piano-based prayer, and ""Wind and Spirit"" has a refreshingly moving autumn feel to it. ""Thirsty"" has a gentle ache that climaxes with the chorus, ""I'm so thirsty..."" and ""Smellin' Coffee"" goes to the other end of the spectrum, with it's playful melody and cheerful lyrics. For as silly as the popular hidden track is, the chorus hook is startlingly addictive. ""One of those Days"" has a more traditional laid back folk feel to it, and the hit ""Big Enough"" has a genuine peacefulness. ""Power of a Moment"" truly is the collection's centerpiece though, embracing layered guitar and synth lines, poetic statements of truth, and a sing-along outro. A truly pleasant CD to listen to."
3,Big Will never surprises me...,"The album isn't completely bad, but I would never label him a hip-hop artist or even a rapper. I think he's strictly a pop artist. ""Switch"" was a good decision on his part to release it as a 1st single. I guess maybe he thought that would encourage people to buy the album. It has a few other ok typical Will Smith songs...and I do like the song ""Tell me why""...but other than that, I would say save your money. Unless you're a die hard Will Smith fan or you like soft lyrics, then this album is not for you"
3,the album,"it is a ""will smith"" album, accepted by everybody, but we dont even know why. My only problem really is why would you ackowledge that Eminem was dissing you and rap like him?!!there is no directions for this album. it's positif but boring, kinda defeats the purpose of being positif then.you almost got it Will, probably by the next album you'll get it. you just 1 step away from the formula."
4,Lost and Found...,Not bad...not bad at all...beats all the foul language that these kids are putting out these days...Four stars!!
2,keep your cash,"Will gave it his best effort, but this album truly is trash. as someone poitned out, all the beats are Timbaland throwbacks, nothing truly hot here. He does touch of some deeper topics, but his flow is lacking on all levels. Even when he 'disses' Eminem (not even a true dis) he steals his entire flow for teh whole verse. most of the songs are full of filler to cover his lack of true content. I like Will, dont get me wrong, when i was 12 and Big Willie Style dropped, it was hot. But the market has changed and his attempt to keep up just doesnt work. He'll def get tons of spins on MTV and top 40 stations, but anyone truly into music won't think twice about this disc. Go pick up some real hip hop, I suggest waiting for the new Common to drop but untill then, look for one of the Murs albums- a true story teller."
1,Will smith + Rap= Trash,"Do you know who the good rappers are? Any Body on AfterMath(Dr. Dre's Label) bisides th LOX's(jadakiss,Etc), ludacris, and many others, but not this guy. i didn't buy this CD i heard all these songs of my friends computers and man do they suck. Hes ust like Ja-Rule, has alot of money but sucks at rapping. Do not Buy this trash, it makes Vanilla ice look good."
5,wow,"Ok ok i dont buy a lot of will smith cds but i heard tell me why because of a upcomin rapper(flow is f*&^king crazy yawll should look out for this kid)but then i started listenin to the whole cd and i was like wow, i dont know will has changed his lyrics and flow. all he needs to do now is get just a lil more harder and then i think he'll make a HUGE wave in the rap game"
1,Bad,"This toy does not stand up. It doesn't have good sound quality and it really isn't worth the money. Find one that doesn't keep falling forwards. Sorry, thumbs down. My son doesn't even give it a second look now."
1,Defective design,"I purchasesd the 2420 over a year ago and at first every worked great. After a while the hand sets had trouble ""communicating"" with the base station. I contacted Siemens who gave me a few things to try which helped at first but eventually the system failed altogether. Siemens wanted to sell me a new base station for $... but my old hand sets would not be compatible; so after spending close to $... on the first phone system they wanted me to spend another $...to make up for their defective product."
1,For use in open space,"As with another reviewer, I too bought this system elsewhere, and with great difficulty returned it. That said, the system was not capable of working in my house. Features notwithstanding, I could not get the answering machine to talk to the hand units if there were even two walls between them. The system would not even work 30 horizontal feet away and one floor down. Then I tried 50 feet and three walls, NOTHING, The last effort was 60 feet and up an open staircase, again nothing. I checked with Siemens technical staff, and was told that my walls were too thick (they are drywall, in a new house, not foot thick masonry walls). I suggest you wait for the next version or use it outside or in a very small house."
1,Range is terrible,"The concept of this phone is good, but the implementation is terrible. The problems:1. The range is about 1/20th the range for a 900 mhz Sony that cost 1/5 as much (the Gigaset will NOT even reach across the house). This is not an isolated instance, two base stations did the same thing as do multiple handsets. The Sony and the gigaset were in the same location too so it was not a factor of varied locations. Whether it is the 2.4Ghz vs 900mhz, I do not know, but the range is very bad. And Siemens' support line was no help at all in resolving the issue.2. The handsets are flimsy and seem low quality.The concept itself is very good, but Siemens needs to do a LOT better job in building a product that reaches its goals. I like the features for the most part (e.g. auto-updating the time on the base station, transferring directory entries between phones, needing only one base station, but having the option of having too), but the problems are sufficient to make the features useless."
1,Totally Unreliable!,"Do not buy it!!! Looks fabulous and is a great idea--but the hand sets inexplicably cut out in the middle of a conversation, not three feet away from the corded phone. A call to Siemen's help line left me with the impression that there was a problem with my line. Now that I see these reviews, I realize that this is the way they are--unbelievable for the price paid."
1,Poor Product,"The well designed telephone worked well for about 6 months then the LCD display began to fade so call-id and other messages could not be read. The handsets then began to have difficulty synchronizing with the base station and the effect was similar to making/receiving a call on mobile phone with poor cell coverage. The low battery life and long charging time made SOHO use impossible. Finally, after 9 months of use, the buttons on the handsets began to fail and you needed to push each button very hard to record an entry. A very poorly designed product. I replaced the set 9 months after purchase with a Panasonic."
3,Beware the Siemens 2420,"I have been using cordless phones,walkie-talkies, and CB radios,since the 1980's, and I own 5 computers. The Siemens company makes great industrial and professional products. The 2420 system has the best features I have ever used in a cordless phone system. I particularily like the voice caller ID the answering machine gives you with voice messages during remote access from another phone.I have used two of these systems and had the same Two problems. 1)The LCD screen looses its resolution over time. They may want to take an orange page from Uniden and replace it. 2)The rubber keys feel wonderful, but the contacts behind the keys will wear out in an unreasonable amount of time. THE TALK Key wears out;The # key - wears out; The 1 key wears out. Just about every company you call will take you through a labyrinth of automation and these keys are crucial to your performance."
1,Infant mortality,"The system failed, piece by piece, with only months of use. And the range was never that good to start with (inside a normal sized, wood framed house). Replaced it with a 5.8GHz system (to avoid WiFi issues) and have been much happier."
3,"The book is semi-informative, but the CD rocks!","Actually, I didn't much like the book--it was pretty much like a series of encyclopedia articles on the greats of Nazi propaganda, but the CD was truly hilarious. My (teenage) children couldn't understand the point of any of the songs, but I was singing ""Let's go bombing, let's go bombing, like United Nations airmen do..."" all next week."
4,"Fascinating combo of suspense, and London Tube history.","Ruth Rendell, writing as Barbara Vine, crafts a suspenseful tale that somehow manages tocombine a fairly extensive history of the London Underground (subway), buskers andinterpersonal psychology. A bit grisly but a fascinating read.- J Scott Morrison"
5,Franco De Vita,"This Cd is perfect, I love this type of music and have not stopped listening to the cd since I received it."
4,Reasonable introduction to HTML and CSS,"There wasn't enough on Javascript to really justify the DHTML in the title. Though the book is a reasonable introduction to HTML and CSS. On the positive side I thought the organization was good, the text was easy to read, the use of red to hilight important code fragments, and the reference section were all very good. On the downside I thought the Quick Start format made the book a little hard to read. And the Alice in Wonderland examples weren't always the most appropriate way to illustrate each point. I would have rather had examples that were closer to what we would see in the real world."
2,"Good book, but nothing you can't find on the net","Good book, but nothing you can't find on the net. Really, that sums it all up. The author goes into a lot of detail about things which a lot of people already know if they're diving into DHTML and CSS. Go to some tutorial webpages and you'll be able to find the exact same information - and more."
5,excelent,Although I've only had this cd for a day or two it's excelent my favorit is The Undertaker remix I love how the song takes us back to the past and brings us to where he is now I love it
3,Not Very Good,"Finally, Evolution's song has been released! But what happened to the Dudley's, Spike's, Eddie's, Snitsky's, Kane's, Chucky P, and Ortons. Trash on the cd: Victoria's, Kidman's, Cena. Could have released a 3 CD album containig all unreseased themes and Pay-Per-View themes like Armageddon 2003."
4,nice,"pretty good but gauil's should have been replaced with either torries or christies and eugenes with the hurricanesLine in the sand 5/5 nice song i'm a huge fan of MotorheadCool 4/5 ok song but a catchy toonMacMilitant 4/5 good but not to impressed with the singerJust close your eyes 5/5 nice song i loved itDangerous politics 2/5 its okReal good girl 1/5 not to good cuz the guy can't singChavito Ardiente 4/5 pretty goodThe darkest side 5/5 awesome undertaker rocksChild's play 1/5 annoying song, cool videoDon't mess with 2/5 okAin't no stoppin me 5/5 great song about never giving upYou can run 5/5 really coolRise up 5/5 drowning pool rulesInterational woman 0/5 this is some serius crappy musicLonghorn 4/5 i hate JBL but cool songUntouchables 3/5 it aint that bad but his album is better"
4,Unique In Every Way,"This is recorded in live performance replete with opening and concluding applause -- a truly individual take on the perhaps overly familiar Beethoven Concerto -- distended and emotive in nearly all facets with Kennedy adding some interesting improvisations, especially in the Finale, and Tennstedt adding understated and sympathetic accompaniment. I certainly find it easy to enjoy hearing this!"
5,Best Kept Secret,"Pushmonkey has got to be one of the hardest rocking bands out there. With a sound reminiscent of Metallica and the harmony of Alice in Chains, Pushmonkey has created a melodic sound that is still worthy of hardcore headbanging. From the hard rocking first and last tracks (""Lefty"" and ""Maybe"") to the quieter ""Loner"" and ""Cut the Cord"" to the chilling story of ""Limitless,"" this album this album is the best kept secret of the rock world today. Even the most critical will not be disappointed."
5,Awesome Album!!,"Pushmonkey has put out a fantastic album full of powerful, hypnotic songs. Check out Cut the Cord, and Ashtray Red if you don't believe it. Damn, this rocks!"
5,Awesome!,"I've had this CD a couple of years now and I still play it a lot. It jams yet it can also be very melodic at the same time. This is a band with great talent! A buddy who had seen them at Ozzfest was playing the CD at work one morning. I HAD to find out who they were. There is not a bad track on the CD! Tracks 1-6 are my favorites, but I never find myself skipping past any of the songs. That's pretty rare these days as most CD's only have a few decent songs. I've heard they are awesome in concert, so I hope I get the chance to see them live! I haven't heard their first CD, ""Maize"", but their 3rd CD, ""El Bitche"" unfortunately finds them jumping on the ""nu-rock"" bandwagon and taking their music in a whole new direction. Very boring songs and a major disappointment compared to ""Pushmonkey"". Take a listen!"
5,Think you've heard the best?,"The sound quality from this game is like none other. The vivacious melodies will stay within your head, such as the theme from which you fight Marisilo, one of the Wisemen. Or, the tranquil sounds of the Shingo Forest. All of the tracks are perfect for travel or trying to get into a state of serenity. Either way, you will be amazed."
3,Really?????,"Nice gloves or I should probably say 'glove'. I bought '4' and received 4 gloves, not 4 pairs. In my experience, gloves are usually sold in pairs, aren't they?. The title of the item says gloves but the description says a glove. Weird, at best, deceptive, at worst. I mean, REALLY??? Gloves sold separately???"
4,Fingerless Gloves,"They are exactly as they say, LARGE FINGERLESS WOOL GLOVES! They're quite comfy and warm, although the fuzzies from the wool get all over my jackets which is what I would expect. All-in-all, though, great for the price!"
1,STAY AWAY FROM SONY DLP TV'S STAY FAR AWAY !!,"This is my second Sony TV with major and costly repairs, just Google Sony Optical Block problems. What looks like a good deal, and test out well in all the consumer guides and rating organizations is anything but a good deal. It use to be that Sony cathode ray tube TV lasted seemingly forever. Not so with rear projection DLP sets. You will get, maybe 2 years before blue, purple or green bands or distortions will happen. I have had it with anything SONY. So many unhappy current and past SONY owners and yet they will do nothing but stand behind a name, offering people nothing for their loyality. Selling my Sony KDF55E2000 with a brand new DLP bulb installed for the labor to get out of my home. Interested?"
3,Costly Repairs,"I will agree with the other's comments about great picture. But I have had my Sony 55"" for 3 years and have had to replace the bulb 3 times so far. Then I have pale purple and yellow spots in the upper middle of the screen. Thank goodness I bought the extended 4 year warrenty with it. those replacement lamps are not cheap, currently they run about 150 bucks. So this means that I will be buying a bulb every year for the life of the television. Dont think so."
1,First year was a great tv but then the un honored recall.,I purchased this tv for 2500 bones and with in a year the tv started demming and noticed splotching of differt blobs of color.Replaced the bulb then it only got worse.Red/pink line on top of screen and blue on the bottom along with color splotching.I never new there was a recall and buy the time I read up on it I called sony and filed a claim and they would not honor the recall.They tried to sell me a new tv for the same price I could of purchased it at best buy or other retailer.And the sad part is the tv they were going to sell me was recalled for catching fire.Not sure why I would buy a new tv I thought recall meant fix or replace?Sony has lost my buisiness.
5,The Glenbrooke Series,"These books are great! These books keep you wanting to read them all over again. But, to really understand these books you really need to read the Christy Miller Series, then the Sierra Jensen Series, then read the Christy and Todd Collage Series,and THEN finally read the Glenbrooke Series. If you only read the Christy Miller Series, you won't know as much info on Christy, that relates to these other series. These books are great! You'll keep wanting to read them over and over again. ROBIN JONES GUNN YOU are the BEST writer in the WORLD! I LOVE YOUR BOOKS!-Kyley(Kimberly's daughter)"
4,EXCELLENT,"The writing on EL Marage is what you would expect from Jimmy Webb, and that is always a good thing. This album reminds me of the material he wrote for Glen Campbel in the 1960s. It certianly has the same travlin' man spirit.The production here, though, is modern--very clean with a lot of popping bass, and the band is letter perfect. But there are female singers, and lots of instrumentation.You can use a lot of adjatives to discribe Webb's music, but cold and sterile are never two--even with digital recording, all the qualities that make Webb's music so particualar to him are here full force. NO ONE sounds like this guy!Great album"
5,Terrific Technique - Questionable Sales Locations,"It is clear that the photography of this book is both artistic and extraordinary. The photos are tremendous, and certainly more disarming than alarming. Yet I wouldn't be caught dead continuing to own this book. The subject matter goes so extremely far against the grain of culture, of my town, that my friends would certainly think the owner of this book a potentially dangerous member of society. This is a five star book - but sales of it are inappropriate in my small town."
5,Great alternative for wall mount!,Very happy with this product looks great. Mount is adjustable for height as well as being able to turn side to side. All wires hide in the mounting arm so you have a clean install. Matching stand is required I believe there are a few different models that go with this stand all are nicely made and look good.
2,"Read it once, and then be glad you're done","This book is ""the best novel ever written."" Of course, the people who say this also rave about James Joyce. The truth is, Anna Karenina is a book you should read, if only so you can say that you read it. The characters range from amusing to annoying, and you'll probably want to drop-kick Anna by page 500. Levin's internal struggle over peasant-noble relations and the agricultural revolution are nausiating. The religious conflicts several of the characters experience become equally tedious. The book is saved by the lovable near-do-well Oblonsky and his wife Dolly. So read this ""classic"" and just be glad it wasn't ""war and peace""; that's even longer."
5,Excellent! Wonna get more!,"No one've heard about Yo-Yo here, in the city I live. But ""Black Pearl"" is so terrific. I think sometime I'll get something else. Q: -Is ""Black Pearl"" Yo-Yo's best album?"
4,asad,"A very interesting and comprehensible book, especially in light of its original's age. The Latin-to-English language translation was concise as well; even for for someone with an elementary knowledge of both Latin and the history of Christian Theology."
4,Surprising,"VERY interesting learning about the life of St. Augustine! It was good to know that even devout people struggle with every day temptations, etc. It was good to see this religious figure as a real person!"
3,front door mat,faded and wore too fast. actually forgot about this item it was purchased so very long ago. would not purchase again
4,very satisfied,Very pleased with quality. All parts in place and fairly easy assembly. Directions were clear and delivery was timely
1,Buy something else!,Visually appealing BUT little to no battery life. Uses 6 C batteries a day! Cheaper to get your toddler satelite radio! No adapter included and I have not been able to find one that will work. If you buy this you and your child will be very disappointed.
3,Inferior Print Quality,I have just received my copy of this book. The print quality of this reprint is not as good as that of the earlier/original version.
4,True Crime Review,I ordered this game for my son and he enjoys playing it...He likes the graphics...the only thing downside is there is foul language in the game.
5,Beautiful in every way!,"The journey toward inner strength and joy continues with this marvelous book. Learning ways to balance your energies, to achieve centricity - that's the key to achieving your life goals and personal desires. Esther and Jerry have done it again in this book that teaches us about the processes of true manifestation. Wonderful!"
2,Similar to Ask and it is Given: Different Title,"This book is ok, but the reason I give it two stars is because it is contains the exact same material as Ask and it is Given (which I would give five stars). So the Material is NOT new; just reworded differently."
3,Less then i expected ..sorry...,This was less then I expected..would rather of read the book ..the speaker's voice(I'm sorry)made me lose interest..however the info was good ....
3,The Amazing Power of Intent,"I thought this book did not compare in any way to the marvelous book by Wayne Dyer's The Power of Intention, a great read. Too many childish quick ways to get IT!. Not a quick thing the art of allowing. Takes scholars years to learn the art of allowing. The great School Ramtha, "" The School of Enlightment) all the students, from all over the globe spend months and some years to get to the ART of Allowing. This book does not have much to say in reality what allowing spiritually means to individuals, how to access that. On occasion within the pages a great glimmer of it seeps through however so rarely not worth thelong read to get it. yes Wayne Dyer gives it a compliment. AS for me I will read Tulle and of course all of Dyers books as fast as he writes them, as the older he becomes, the better his read."
2,Same Ol' Same Ol',"While I am a HUGE fan of Abraham, Jerry and Esther, and live my life as Abraham has taught, I am a little disappointed in this second book. It contains no more information than was provided in the first book. I don't suppose there was any new information that could have been given to us readers, but that was somewhat my expectation with the release of a second book. While I appreciate Jerry and Esther very much for what they have imparted to us through Abraham, and for the role they have played in my life, it now comes across as just trying to make a buck by reorganizing the same words as the first book and calling it ""new""."
5,Excelent service.,This audio book is wonderful. I can listen while doing other things and the information is invaluable.
3,Carol,"Awesome possibilities that reach you each time you read this book....and you will read it many many many times for there are so many layers, realizations and understandings."
3,What a read,"Great book for someone who is open minded and believes that we are energy and that ""others on the other side"" are still around to help."
4,mastered your mind? get going on those emotions with this book,"This book is about guiding ones emotions to a higher vibrational rate, one baby step at a time. The idea is to simply take on different perspectives and notice how they make you feel. Taking on new perspectives, engaging in thought experiments is a great habit for anyone. I gave it four stars only, because I love their hand held cards. The book has the advantage of helping those who are 'really stuck' by demonstrating the types of new angles one may take on a handful of specific life situations. That said, there are a few experiments I haven't yet explored fully. I will revise when I have."
5,The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent: Living the Art of Allowing,"I was great to have a follow up to ""Ask and it is Given"". It was helpful to have concepts repeated and explained in greater depth. I found the exercises to be simple yet powerful. In these stressful times I appreciate knowing that I have power to use my thoughts in creating a more peaceful world."
4,"From the Author of ""My Truths, Accepting Higher Knowledge""","A countinual source of inspiration, so I appreciate the book for that fact. While there was much useful information provided within this book, there were several life situations discussed that I had little interest in."
2,Just not funny.,"It's really funny how everyone who dislikes this CD is called a republican catholic right-winger and whatnot. From a strict comedy point of view,this CD fails miserably. It would be much more accurate to file this CD under 'long-winded political and religious rants'. It may be spot-on as political commentary but certainly not as comedy. Although perhaps some people enjoy listening to someone read from a Promisekeepers program. I can't get rid of this boring CD quickly enough.And before you attack me, I enjoy left wing and off-color comedy immensely. In fact most of the best comedians are both left-wing and off-color. Lewis Black and George Carlin are two who jump to mind as being able to skillfully merge politics and comedy into something amusing regardless of your own political views. The priority on a comedy CD should be, make sure you are funny first and THEN work in political commentary."
3,"I do live in atlanta, and while the disc was","amusing at times, comparing this guy to George Carlin is waayyy off base. His level of bitterness with with various movements/organizations be they political or religious, is not equal to his supposed 'insights'. Yeah, um, we get that it is silly to take the Bible literally.... George Bush isn't all that bright...gotcha... Being mad at rednecks, republicans and religion is one thing ---- bringing humor along with the vitriol is what the masters (Carlin, Bruce) we're able to do. Dave's about half way there."
5,david is the man,"This CD is intelligent and funny. David is too. It's worth buying, in my opinion. I am a 25 year old college senior in English Lit."
5,Gorgeous vitriol from David Cross,"If you've never seen Mr. Show, buy the DVD now. I mean, stop reading this review and type Mr. Show into the search box.This CD is spit-milk-through-your-nose funny. Cross's targets are rednecks, George W. Bush, and [more] but his real hatred is reserved for stupidity in all its myriad forms, eg: putting an American flag on your Lexus SUV.My favorite quote so far is on the support for GWB after 9/11. ""We treat him like he just won third place in the Special Olympics. Good boy, George!"""
2,A huge disappointment,"I was (and still am) a huge fan of ""Mr. Show"". It was the only reason I kept my HBO subscription. It's hard for me to believe that the same talent that created ""Mr. Show"" produced this weak offering. Might be the least funny comedy CD I've ever heard. Virtually all the material in the album has been done before, and much better, by other comedians. Most of the bits just lay there and die. Mr. Cross seems to realize this and tries to make up for it by saying f*ck a lot. Sorry, it just doesn't work.Don't waste you money on this one. Get the ""Mr. Show"" DVDs instead and forget this ever existed."
3,So so,I think David Cross is about the funniest guy ever. This disc is not that good. Couple chuckles here and there and long stretches of rambling unfunniness in between.
4,I love this invention,"I believe this is the best invention since sliced bread! The unit does cover to love, so luckily for us we have a drop ceiling, so I got creative and hung it at a higher level so it covers more of the shower. It keeps the shower freser longer and I hate nothing more than to scrub a shower, so when I do have to clean it, it is not as hard, keeps the scum off. This is a little expensive and I wish the units would last longer in between having to buy a whole new unit.........but like I said I HATE cleaning showers and this is the best thing on the market so far to make this job easier. Now I wish their other products were in rust proof containers, I would use them more often. Finding some coupons to buy would be nice too."
1,Design Flaw in Scrubbing Bubbles Battery Compartment Fills Up With Cleaner,"I bought this unit thinking it would help keep the shower clean. I was not under the impression it would clean every part of my shower. After all showers come in many shapes and sizes. And, it never cleaned one half of my 4 by 4 shower. But, I helped it by cleaning the other part of the shower.HOWEVER...Most problematic was the DESIGN FLAW in the battery compartment. The cleaner leaks or spatters into the closed battery compartment when it hits the nearest wall behind it.I recycled it today!Back to more manual cleaning...BH"
1,"Not worth it, folks.","Based on other reviews, perhaps some units work better than others, but for the first week, when mine worked, it smelled nice, and could have been doing its job (not like my shower was in bad shape). However, the first trouble was it would do its 12 seconds of beeping and then not spray. I would have to monkey with it to get it to work properly on several mornings. Then it stopped working all together. I discovered the residue built up in the battery case, making the contacts full of goo. Cleaning that off, it would work for a while, then go back to the other problem of beeping but not spraying.Coupled with the rate at which it goes through solution, and the amount of maintenance I've had to put into it, I'm throwing mine out today. Going to use the refills I purchased for cleaning the normal way."
2,Not work on mildew...too good to be true!!,"The problem with our bathroom is mildew/mold, all blacken on the edge of the shower tub. I tried this automatic shower cleaner for more than a month, but there is no effect on removing the mildew. It cleans a little bit of stains on the wall, shower door and floor of the tub, but the effect is not obvious. And it can't reach the back shower wall! Also, the smell of the chemical cleaner is really BAD, especially in my house which the bathroom has no window for air flow. I sometimes feel difficulty breathing smelling the chemical (I used to suffered from asthma).The only advantage is that it's very easy to use, just press the button everyday. But it is just too good to be true.Not recommend to buy this...better try with Tilex and scrubbing!!"
1,Piece of junk - poor quality,"I had the same experience as CraigF with 2 different units. It didn't clean well at all, maybe it's because we have a plastic tub surround. Doesn't even touch the tub itself. Also both units failed after about 2-3 months, just quit spraying. The company itself replaced the first one, then the second did the same thing. Finally asked for and got my $25 back.Bob"
5,Worth it,"I've been buying Bosch bits from Home Depot. Generally, drilling concrete, I was lucky to sink four holes before the bit became bent and useless (they would bend long before they became dull). These bits are considerably less expensive and a better quality. If you have a similar problem, you might give these a try. I'm happy."
1,pathetic,"Ridiculous amateur attempt at filmmaking. The film is so bad it ruined listening to Pink Floyd for me for YEARS. You would have to be pretty weak minded to think this movie is groundbreaking, deep, or powerful. Maybe if your normal fare is Cheech and Chong, this would seem like a really intelligent piece of art. I wonder if Bob Geldof ever thinks about all the good things that could have been done for the world with the money that was wasted on this crap film. Do the world a favour and don't buy this DVD; give the money to charity and take a nap instead."
2,What Makes a Great Album Does Not Make a Great Film,"The album is great. That doesn't mean you should make a movie of it!Roger Waters' vison, when splayed across a big screen, is really appalling. We always knew he liked the dark best but I don't think I need to see it in Panavision. Depressing and without much to offer it (outside of the fact it is associated with Pink Floyd). Skip it."
4,my gut feeling told me,"i know going with amazon was the best option. i recieved my order fast and was very pleased with the product.even when i buy through amazon from other sellers my gut feeling tells me that since its through amazon, it's ok."
2,Profundamente decepcionado!,"Eu já possuía a primeira verso desse título em DVD, e, equivocadamente entendi que essa ""edio especial"" apresentasse diferna que muito me interessa: imagem no aspecto 16:9. O formato widescreen Hi-Definition anunciado na descrio do produto, no é nada mais que o mesmo aspecto da edio anterior, que deixa largas faixas pretas acima e abaixo do filme. Definitivamente, no era isso o que eu queria!"
5,"""Tear Down the Wall""","""The Wall"" is a partly animated film with music augmented from the Pink Floyd album of the same name, directed by Alan Parker and animated by Gerald Scarfe. Reflects the band really well, I think.Bob Geldof plays Pink, a rock star who's burnt out, traumatized by his past and recently divorced. He remembers his childhood, imagines his future and sinks into the metaphors of his head, of walls, of faceless students, of blood and lusty flowers. It's interesting that way, how it all flows, it is like a mix of imagination and memory. It's pretty intense imagery.Special features include a commentary by Roger Waters and Gerald Scarfe, where they discuss inspirations, memories and the making of the film. There's also a couple of loose music videos, one for ""Another Brick in the Wall"" and another for ""Hey You"", there's a promotional trailer, a making of documentary, and a couple of galleries of stills and concept art. There's also a few sound effects as Easter eggs."
5,Very cool.,This movie really freaked me out when I seen it a long time ago. Ever sence then I have been looking for that movie all over the place.I have not found it yet I would love to get my hands on this movie again.
5,The sum of Roger Waters' aggression and frustration.,"It seems that the tighter the grip Roger Waters had on Pink Floyd, the darker and more conceptual the music became. Pink Floyd--The Wall is all of Roger's passion, emotion, and past displayed in one of the most beautiful albums/movies that has ever been created. Exploring loneliness, contempt, despiration, bliss, and power, this movie covers the entire spectrum of the human soul. If you don't understand it, good. Roger Waters didn't write for the masses, he didn't write for public appeal. He wrote out of the soul, creating a brain-child not meant to be understood entirely, but meant to give you your own meanings and subtleties."
5,Watch it more than one time and you'll see.....,"I am addicted to this movie, and go to see it in our English-speaking cinema as often as it's on. Unfortunately (like sarah mentioned already some lines below) you can't get this movie on video in Europe at the moment... !!!!"
3,good but not worth it,"the only good thing about this movie is that it has pink floyd music in it. pink floyd is one of the greatest rock bands of all time, no doubt, but this movie is sort-of lame. if you want to waste your money, get this, but otherwise rent it and then decide whether or not u should buy it."
3,I like this movie for the music.,I recomend this movie if you feel like closing your eyes and listing to the music. But the movie really didn't make a lot of sence to me. B ut don't let that stop you from buying it.
5,mind bender,"I saw this film nearly ten years ago and still has an effect on me similar to prozac.Possibly the best film released that's still legal. My favorite part concerns the battle field and the song ""mother""."
5,Buy them all if you are comics fan!,I can tell you I was quite skeptical when I saw this....but I was wrong! Each one of these comic discs has a dramtic reading in the style of a small film with comic panels. I was surprised at how good the acting was and would tell any fan of comics to grab these while they last. I don't understand why more comics fans didn't buy these? They are quite good and I don't see why Marvel wouldn't want to make more of them.As a fan of the Hulk I have to say the producers did do a good job of translating this into the format.
2,Marty let me down,"I had two problems with this DVD. First: My IMAC computer disc drive was almost ruined by the disc (rub,rub,rub,rub)when I tried to play the DVD. Refund in progress...Second: This DVD does not provide meaningful ""tips for advanced players"". The presentation of the various tips are great, but the target audience should/could be the advanced NOVICE player at best.I am 50 years old and have been playing this game off and on since 1975. I had hoped this DVD would give me some visual insights to get beyond ""B"" level play. Along with the DVD, I also purchased Championship Racquetball by Fran Davis & Jason Mannino. The detail and depth of subject their book provides seems to be just what I was looking for."
5,"The Mitford Years, Books 1-3","If you enjoy heart-warming stories, you will love all the books by Jan Karon. I have read her 9 Mitford books. They will give you hope that there is good in the world and that you can be a part of it. If you are a baby boomer or a parent of one, you will recognize a lot of things that you grew up with -- mostly how simple things are very dear. I have recommended these books to friends -- especially ones who are having a difficult time -- they will renew your spirit."
2,Not worth the money!!!!,"We purchased this slide last summer for our 4 children. None of them weigh over 50 lbs. After a few days of use it started getting water inside but still inflated okay. They enjoyed a full summer of fun last year. Unfortunately this summer we were only able to play on it a few times. The inner liner deteriorated and the outside liner began to rip at the seams. We contacted Little Tikes who told us what patch to buy and so we patched it in several places. It worked for one day then the slide did not blow up fully anymore. The kids hit the ground when they tried to slide so we had to throw it away. It was a waste of almost $400. Needless to say we were all quite disappointed. Also, just to let you know, the slide was always properly taken care of and stored properly. I hope this helps someone! Definitely save your money, there are better slides out there!CandaceMadison, MS"
1,worst coburn movie i have seen,"Boring from beginning to end.If I had seen it I wouidn't have bot it.Why did I buy it?Catchy title, James Coburn , 4 star reviews by Fan-atics.I hope my buyer loves it."
3,Roundup of Classic Tango,"Solid soundup of (presumably) classic tango tracks - if you're dancing the tango, you probably want to give it a 4-star, if you're just a listener, this might be more of a 2.5, the sound quality varies (as expected) and tango music is really not for sitting and listening as it's more dramatic than fun or sexy (when one is just strictly listening to tango music and not dancing to it, of course)."
1,Give it a miss,"Dreadfully verbose, and wanders all over the place. An excellent example of a book (and author) that is a hostage to, and victim of, fashion. Normal people call documentation just that; they don't invent a ridiculous word to merely justify yet-another-book."
5,It's been a long time,This the reason why I became a Sonic fan myself too. Story was very interesting and i got really hook on to it. lol 11 years man now its finally on DVD. fan or not you will like the series if its in your taste.For the comics in my oponion was alittle off the edge but it still kept the same characters i know from SatAM and they started to add some more even the ones from the video games with there own background. Well that is all I'm going to say. I'm just happy to see its going to be on DVD and i will see all the episodes i miss on there. happy new years all
5,"Best cartoon, period!","I grew up watching this cartoon, and it blew me away! The storylines, the plot, everything was what made this cartoon the best Sonic cartoon out there!"
4,HooDoo,"""The Skeleton Key"" is a good thriller with an expert cast headed by Kate Hudson (Caroline), Gena Rowlands (Violet) and a mute John Hurt (Ben).Director Iain Softley (the stunning ""Wings of a Dove"") has a great eye for the grotesque and the beauty that lies therein and his mise en scene is cluttered with over-hanging Ivy, cataract-blinded country folk, crumbling mansions with scary attics, sweat-inducing humidity and back-woods depravity vs. upper crust, tuxedoed depravity in the bayou country just outside of New Orleans.There are also great big doses of Hoodoo thrown in to spice-up this boiling Gumbo of a movie but for once the attitude of the film, thanks to Softley and the amazing cast, is one of tolerance and respect: ""The Skeleton Key"" has the good sense to believe in it's own themes and characters and as a consequence it scares the hell out of us because, despite our better judgment... we start to buy into it also."
4,Good twist...,"This film was entertaining; everytime I thought I knew what was going on, something else happened. Very entertaining. I won't blab away the plot, but Kate Hudson is solid in, what I think, is her first lead role. She handles it with fierce conviction. It helps that she had to deal with the champions, Gena Rowlands and John Hurt. Peter Saarsgard is, as usual, confident and in control. Director Iain Softley handled this film well, and the DVD offers generous extras. It was well thought-out, and the casting of the great Gena Rowlands and the great John Hurt are reason enough to see this film. Don't get me wrong, Hudson is terrific, as is Joy Bryant, as Hudson's friend who knows more than she cares to tell. Fun movie. Check it out."
2,Not her best ever,"Caroline (Hudson) takes a job as a live-in nurse caring for the sick husband (Hurt) of an elderly woman (Rowlands) at their run-down mansion outside of New Orleans. She begins to explore the house using a skeleton key that unlocks every door and uncovers a terrible secret in the attic.This movie was okay, a little scary, but I'd wait for cable. Not Hudson's best ever."
4,Pretty good,"I like Kate hudsons movies. She's not really ALL that hot, but she's not that bad, but she IS a very good actress and she plays parts WELL. She pulls you into it, makes you feel it. As far as the subject matter, im a christen, theres nothing that can come past the blood of jesus. If there's evils trying to come for you, simply call on the protection of jesus. He will ALWAYS defend you"
4,Great movie with a great twist at the end. Just a little too long.,"The story is really good.The acting very good. With a little more editing the movie could have been great. I liked it and loved the ending but it was just a bit too long and should have been edited more to move it along. Still, worth your time for sure."
5,Great Movie,"I went to see this movie the second week that it came out. It was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Lately, all the movies that come out are either stupid or unoriginal. However this movie was original, not so much scary because I didn't get scared at all but the plot is good and Kate Hudson gives a good performance. If you believe in ghosts and voodoo, then this is a must-see."
5,"A Horror Film With Merit, And No Blood needed!","Dismiss those BLOOD BATHS,Friday the 13th - From Crystal Lake to Manhattan (8 Movies),A Nightmare on Elm Street,Halloween,andChild's Play 3's, for a different source of terror! This suspenseful tale, keeps viewers wondering what's bound to happen next, to a nosy caretaker? Her inexperience leads her into a spiral of trouble, where getting out is no longer an option!"
5,Great movie at a great price!,Bought this movie for my wife as a gift. She watches it over and over when nothing is on TV.
1,The KEY to NOWHERE,- There is no suspense and no thrilling.- There is too little material for the actors to work on.- My friend and I watched it in the theatre. What a waste of money.
1,this movie was not good at all!,This was the worst movie ever. I wanted to turn the movie off in the middle but veryone was saying that the ending was the most shocking ending since the sixth sensce. The ending was not good at all. There were no scary parts. I hope this stops someone from seeing this movie.
3,Pretty Good Movie....,"Living in Louisiana myself, I was excited to see this film. I was not disappointed. Even though not a ""horror"" movie, this movie is a good thriller and delivers alot of suspense. Kate Hudson plays the part very well. The filming of the movie was tastefully done giving everyone a little glimpse of the Louisiana Bayous!! The movie keeps you interested from beginning to end and keeps you wondering what's next. Definetly worth watching. You will not get bored."
2,Occult,"Occult thriler starring Kate Hudson. Worth renting once. Other than some occult imagery though, I wouldn't give it much praise. Not especially good, nor especially bad. Overall, an o.k. thriller however."
4,The Skeleton Key (Widescreen Edition) (2005)-Great horror flick!,"The Skeleton Key (Widescreen Edition) (2005)- I give the Skeleton Key four full stars for a good plot, script, direction, acting, and on location footage. The ending to this movie was totally unpredictable and kept me guessing until the very conclusion. Very good performance by the very lovely Kate Hudson and lots of old New Orleons horror atmosphere."
5,A GREAT FIRST CLASS THRILLER!!!!!!!!,"The Skeleton Key is just a basic edge of your seat thriller and Kate Hudson does a wonderful job in the movie!!!!!! I liked this movie,because they don't use special effects and i liked that they filmed it in Louisiana!!!!! When Kate applies for a new care giver job she realizes that the house that she is staying in is haunted by ghosts and by the magic of voodoo!!!!! Its up to Kate to get this old man out of the house and same for her!!!!!!!! This movie almost reminded me of The Sixth Sense and The Serpent and the Rainbow which by the way great flicks to check out!!!!!! If you are in a video store then go pick yourself a copy of this edgy thriller you will enjoy it!!!!!"
4,This film gives you that old 'Something's going to happen' feeling,"If I didn't know better, I could swear that this movie was the work of Alfred Hitchcock. It had you on the edge of your seat. You kept thinking something's going to happen, you know the something's going to happen and you still jump when it does. The ending is pure Hitchcock. I enjoyed every eye covering, finger biting minute."
2,Transfer & sound could be better,"I remember watching this movie on HBO as a kid. So when I saw it released as a ""Digitally Remastered Director's Cut"", I picked it up.First, The movie has not aged that well. The editing & the way the story just cuts around (especially in the beginning) and during other parts of the movie makes it feel like a lot of stuff got cut out between scenes.Several times throughout the movie the sound cuts off as if someone pushed a mute button during the transfer.The ""Digitally Re-mastered"" picture doesn't seem so. There are several scratches or lines that go across the whole picture during a couple of frames that last a good while before clearing up. There is grain and fuzziness throughout the movie, but does look better than previous releases of this movie.Overall this release is a little disappointing. I am also guessing this is the same transfer done for the dvd version as the artwork & release dates are the same. Not worth the price unless you really love this movie."
3,Not what I remembered it to be...,When I first viewed this film back when it was released it was at the very least entertaining. Now it is totally silly and the acting is abysmal.
2,"Shame on you, Anchor Bay!!!","I remember seeing this little movie when I was 10 or 11 and was quite shocked by it. Imagine my disappointmet when I got this horrible transfer into my player! Anchor Bay, one of my absolute favorite distribution companies, has failed. The print is terribly scratched and the sound goes in and out towards the end. Don't bother."
3,THE SEQUEL IS BETTER!!!! THIS ONE SUCK'S!!!!,"DON'T LET THE COVER FOOL YOU! In this movie Exterminator only use the flamethrower just to show it to a friend and THAT'S IT!! the rest is him with a motorcycle, cool helmet and a gun. The sequel is the one with the cool concept of ""Flamethrower Man""!!!!There is strong violence but very little action, slow storyline, and low production.P.S: If you like movies like this the buy Charles Bronson's Death Wish (1974)."
2,A bit dated; not for all writers,"Marjorie has something to say and says it well, but I find little from this book that I can take away and use for my own writing development. Her style might do well in more conservative publications, but, in general, I find it a bit dated.I certainly believe in writing in a warm, conversational, and humorous manner (this review aside!) but Marjorie's style strikes me as overly sentimental and ""pat."" Also, as a liberal, non-Christian, urban lesbian, few of Marjorie's suggestions for topics apply to me. She also makes some statements that I find offensive.If you're planning on writing for Guideposts or for Chicken Soup for the Soul, snap this up. If you're a suburban heterosexual mother of four, this book may be inspirational. However, if you're looking to publish in more progressive or liberal venues, or you like writing with a bit of an edge, pass this book by. You can find encouragement and affirmation in other books on the Reference shelf."
2,Great for a while,"This was a great unit for about 2 wks. Then it developed a leak and the heating unit did not heat the water well....wonderful concept though, faulty construction."
3,ok,Actually after shipping the product cost more than getting it at my local pet store. I had not been able to find the filters I needed untill I found them on Amazon. At the time I was glad to pay the price for them. it was cheeper than getting a new filter unit. A few days after I recieved the order I found them at the pet store for about $2.00 cheeper per filter.The filters worked great and arrived quickly.
4,cute,"I got this just 3 years too late :) my boy is almost 4...but with another baby on the way we did get it and my son loves it, I'm sure next one will enjoy it too. The water coming out of his mouth is cute, but word of warning (and one star off) is that it is made of pretty firm material so even though it is MUCH better than hitting your self on sharp metal faucet, it still might hurt your little one."
4,Elephant Bath Dispenser,This looks better in the picture but it worked best as a safety barrier so my boy didn't hit it by accident. Water ran through it ok.
1,I could not make myself finish this book,"I have read- and loved- several Anne McCaffrey books, but this was not one of them. I was repulsed when I came to the part where Mrs. McCaffrey attempts to set up a mystery-Talent who has a secret enmity for the aliens aboard. However, she repeatedly gave away who it was- from the looks on the character's face, to a near-outright confession. These seemed to me to be an insult to the reader's intelligence and made this book one of a very few books which I was too disgusted to finish. Still, part of my disappointment stems from the knowledge that she can write much better than this, and has."
3,Not Much Imagination.,"Aimed at really young readers, this board book serves best as an introduction to Thomas the Tank and his friends. The stories are extremely short and are told using lacid language and the cartoon illustrations that have become so familiar. Each of the six mini-miniture tales are accompanied by a finger tab so young readers can flip to their favorite. There are a lot of better Thomas books out there, but really young fans of Thomas and those who have never met Thomas and his friends, will enjoy this paltry book the most."
3,"Good Overview, Not So Good Details","Endless Forms Most Beautiful gives a good enthusiastic overview of the recent advances in evolution theory incorporated in the term ""Evo Devo"". However, the exposition of the new developments is very hard to follow. The author, apparently not wanting to burden readers with low-level details, omits precisely those low-level details which are essential to understanding and following the actual workings of Evo Devo. For instance, the book discusses switches, a major component of Evo Devo, but omits any exposition of how they really work within DNA. Thus the thrust of the book is superficial."
3,"Interesting subject, but not very well written.",The subject matter is very interesting. But it is not as well presented as could be. Well worth a read just for the information content.
4,Kindle version lacks figures - a serious flaw,"This is a wonderful book and in book form it deserves the great reviews. It is incomprehensible that the Kindle version was released without the essential figures. At one point (fig 4.4) we are told to ""Look carefully at th1s figure before reading on."" This is maddening. The Kindle book should be recalled immediately and figures added. Black and white versions of the plates would be appreciated.Update: Amazon cheerfully refunded my money and said they would check into this flaw. Book version arrived promptly and is truly wonderful, so I upgraded from 1 star to 4. Boy, people sure hate 1 star ratings!"
1,Poor Quality,"This book was very hard to understand. It had sections that were poorly organized with a total disregard for extensive examples. Examples that were shown were not only short, but were unrepresentative of problems that were shown in the Problem section at the end of each chapter. I also found it extremely frustrating that the author insisted on including problems in the problem section that required him to basically add full explanations and include indepth lessons for each. The author of this book clearly overestimates the knowledge held by most beginner Signal students."
1,Dim Mak...True or False?,"I bought this book with the expectation to find some thorough background on Dim Mak...unfortunately, according to the author Dim Mak was invented by a man with X-ray vision!!! So, from that point of view I think it was a waste of money. Also the schematics which shows that if you hit someone on a point A, he will die in two weeks...right. I do believe (and based on experience) that hitting certain points on the body will be extremely pain full and effective from a martial arts point of view. But if you are looking for that, please buy another book. Or mine...on EBAY."
4,Near Perfection,"I'm blown away by this game. THe graphics, the story, the voice-acting, the controls. There really isn't anything bad about this game.If I HAD to find something to gripe about---it would be that the ""open-environment"" could be larger, and the story could be less-linear.Other than that, this is a perfect game.THE GAME OF THE YEAR, folks. You won't be disappointed. It's essentially ""Grand Theft Auto: 1875"""
3,Meh,"This is my first electric razor. I got it several years ago, and It's just kind of so-so. The issue I have at this point is that it's becoming increasingly difficult to find parts for this thing. Especially the shaving gel packets.I suppose that's more of an indictment of the razor itself, instead of the blade. But anyway, the blade works. I'm disappointed that it seems to be dropping out of the support sphere for Phillips Norelco. A year from now, the machine will work fine, but I may not be able to get a blade for it."
5,another great mix,"Groove armada got this chill compilation thing down cold. You can expect to hear much of the same here as you heard on their back to mine release, if youve heard it. Hip-hop, dance, soul, a excellent disco tune 'standing in the rain', & I dont even care for disco, but this song is pretty good, & a really cool cover of pink floyds 'breathe' is here also. I didnt really care for 'ya playin yaself' at first, being that the first half was with out music, but it soon grew on me & it does slide into the next track without flaw. If you like groove armada, or liked their 'back to mine' disc, get this. Also check out zero 7's another late night cd."
3,Good price.,You'll still need two hands to steady it. Its light and focus works as expected. Its better than no magnification. Fits well in my fishing bag. Won't use for hunting.
3,Difficult to focus.,Would suggest that one looking for monocular go to a conventional telescope. Got it for hunting due to a bad eye. Takes too long to fo9cus.
4,"The true single version of ""Everything She Wants""","This is the only place so far where you can actually find the true single version of ""Everything She Wants."" It's exactly like I remembered it was on the vinyl 45 back in the '80s. (The version at over 6 minutes is actually the twelve inch version, which you can find more easily.)"
1,Intersex is NOT transgender,"The author of this book incorrectly includes infants born with genetic conditions under the transgender term. Intersex conditions are those in which an infant is born with sex chromosomes or sexual reproductive organs that are not exclusively male or female. Their condition is about sex, not gender. Transgenders on the other hand, are biologically born male or female but have gender identity issues. They are different, as are the medical needs and experiences.The author should be more respectful of people with intersex conditions and publish an apology. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
1,poor quality,This item is very poor in quality. It is plastic and unable to sustain making large batches of cookies etc. I had better luck with a hand press cookie press. For the money - this is not worth it.
1,Bad movie. Don't even rent or buy it!,"I just watched this movie. This movie is bad! Don't even rent or buy it! This is part of the series ""Left Behind"" It goes around the same subject about the end of the world. This movie does not show anything new.I do not want to bore you with details about this movie. Do not waste your time watching this movie! It is so bad!!!"
4,A classic!,"My favourite among Tyrone Power's work. It is understandable why he was so popular during his time. The constant smoking in this movie too is a reminder of the commerialization of the genre in order to sell cigarettes, and of Power's untimely death from the consequences of smoking. Gene Tierney was also excellent and beautiful. The rest of the cast was great too."
3,hmmmm,"so im glad they at least didnt try to mix all these songs together in a continuous ""dj"" mix. that probably would've sounded atrocious. i bought it for the oops oh my cover, and was disappointed. ladytron using real drums, and a fuzzed up guitar? come on, it sounded kinda bad. i love ladytron, but paying like 17 bucks for a mix cd they made with a crappy new version of blue jeans and a kinda lame cover on it isnt really worth it. but i bought it anyway. it gets 3 stars cuz i love ladytron and wouldnt give them anything less, even if they released an album of them farting."
5,"I Give It ""5 Paws!""","I own this book and love reading it. It is an enjoyable book for me because dogs are my favorite animal and I went crazy when I heard about ""Puppy Patrol"", I just had to get some Puppy patrol"" books. Wright now I own 5 of these great books. I think people who like this serries should Read "" Animal Ark"" books, I love animals and want to be a vet so I think all anoimal lovers and future vets should read ""Puppy Patrol"" and ""Animal Ark"" books."
5,Classics speak for themselves,"Movie buffs will love this movie. Carole Lombard was known for screwball comedy, but she knew how to be dramatic too."
5,Josh Davies (Dj Shadow) and Keb Darge (Dj at Madam Jo Jo's),"Are pure masters at the funk they spin on there wheels of steel. Now the people who know whats cool have selected there best coolest tracks and put it all on one CD. So this is on cool mother. I have got it on CD and Vinyl so this is my most played piece when im Dj-ing with the masters music. (by the way josh davies and keb darge didn't write the songs, just selected them from there massive collections). This is beautiful. BUY IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Stackable,Good for storage, but not air tight","I bought 2 of these storage bins a couple years ago at Walmart, (got them in beige color with clear lids) in a trip to the ""city"" I didn't have enough time to check for air-tightness but they seemed alright. Well, for me they were not very resistant because when I got them home one of them had already cracked on the big lid :(What I like is that they are stackable, so you can put one on top of another (I store rice in one and flour in the other) so it is practical, BUT is not air tight as the label says.It is very hard to open and close the big or small lid to put in place the rubber seals, most of the time it wont close properly. Thankfully I live in a dry area otherwise the contents would spoil.I also bought at Amazon the Richell Pet Food Keeper (24Qt) and that one is amazing, is durable, sturdy and is air-tight, at the time if I would have known this, I would have bought only the Richell ones; and it was less expensive too...$19 vs $34 :)"
1,Airtight Lid Isn't Airtight--Useless,"I read some other reviews here about the product not sealing, and I had hoped it was just a fluke, but nope, after I poured my bag of food in, we realized the lid didn't close. So not only is 35 lbs of dog food currently going stale, but now I have to take this giant useless and expensive thing to a post office because of the most essential design flaw."
5,Bergan 50-Pound Large Smart Storage is BIG,"THis bin is larger than I estimated. The description is not ""inflated"" at all. I thought I'd need 2 but this 1 holds 42 lbs. of kibble all 3 in their original bags with a little space to spare.The seals and flaps work easily for me & I have some physical challenges."
3,"Durable, tough AKONA Large Snorkeling Bag","I've used the larger AKONA snorkel bag on numerous snorkel trips to Key Largo and the Caribbean. It's durable and because of the fabric - a bit heavy..but it holds your mask, fins, snorkel, snorkel vest and still room for a bit more. Only drawback is the strap..it tends to slide off your shoulder. It would be better if they used backpack type straps or if they could install a zip and you could have either the single strap or backpack type strap."
1,Technics turntables are overrated,"I have a pair of turntables that still work in perfect condition for over 7yrs now.. And just recently bought the 1210m5g's about a little over a year ago; and already having problems with them.. Now the outside construction is nice, but the inside look like a child put it together. How can panasonic charge an unreasonable price & make a poor quality turntable.. I'll never buy a technic turntable ever again. I mean over 2grand for a pair of turntables? That's why they're discontinuing their turntable product, because they have well over the sucker ratio.. So I guess the statement is true when they say: ""fool me once shame on you."" So as you can see panasonic paid or gave away free equipment to celebrity dj's to advertise their product & we fell for it, but I will never again.. Josh"
1,Really Bad Toy,"The Toy dosent even stick together i mean, When you finsh building something you pick it up and it falls apart and the magnetic is not even that strong of quality, you should sell your product for much cheaper"
4,So many typos - why?,"I enjoyed these 2 works tremendously. It's part of a retirement project to read as many iconic works as possible that somehow I didn't get down to reading early in life. However, in this day and age of spellcheckers, why are there so many typos in this Kindle edition? It looks as if the works were scanned and translated into text by software, but not then checked. Come on Amazon, you can do better."
3,Learn by Doing,"This is the mime book for someone who learns by seeing and doing. Through 45 detailed scripts, the future mime learns the vocabulary and scope of the art. From a child eating ice cream to a sports fan, the reader sees examples of mime in the mind's eye. There is almost no theory in this book, just good, practical scripts for one, two, or more actors."
1,I am a mime,"It is better to invent your own routines, there is no technique, no history of mime, not much of value."
2,"Weird, Seemingly Incomplete","This video was a bit weird. It had some good potential but didn't live up to it in my opinion. If you are a fan of this game, then yes, you have to see it. But for the rest of us why bother?"
4,Good violin string,"I always purchase Thomastik Dominant violin strings because as a violin player, I like the sound produced by using them in practice or in performance. They last too."
5,TOURMASTER/CORTECH LRX AIR WOMENS,This is my wife's first MC jacket and she loves it. Very versatile with two separately removable linings for use in most any temperature. Highly visible in white with reflective accents and looks sharp too. Sizing was just what she expected from the product description.
5,Carlos Fuentes esta equivocado,Fuentes dice en el Espejo Enterrado que Rocinante es una yegua y no es cierto. Reto al mismo Carlos Fuentes a que me lo demuestre.
4,NOT ANITA BUT THIS WILL DO,"THIS IS MY FILL UP TO ANITA BAKER AND I LOVE NEVER FOR A RING THE GIRL BLOWS THIS SONG OUT ,THIS WHOLE CD IS WORTH THE PRICE I JUST LOVE HER VOICE I CAN PLAY THAT SONG ALL DAY ,SHE WAS TURNING TO A BIT OF A HOOCHIE ON HER LAST ALBUM, AS LONG AS SHE BELTS HER TRADEMARK SONGS SHELL BE GOOD"
2,Huge Disappointment,"I am a HUGE Toni Braxton fan and had very high expectations for this long overdue album. Man was I disappointed. Contrary to Amazon's review of the album, I find it much too dance oriented and unmelodic. Secrets was a GORGEOUS album, whereas The Heat barely displays beauty. In addition, this album relies far too much on background vocals, by actually pushing them to the point they overpower Toni's gorgeous voice. Spanish Guitar has so much promise, but is ultimately mired by backing vocals that don't match the genre. They sound like they would be more at home on an Osmond Brothers album. Like Mariha Carey, I wish Toni would do a stripped down album with no vocal pyrotechnics or backup singers. Don't waste your money. I give this two stars primarily for what I think are the two ""best"" tracks: ""He Wasn't Man Enough,"" and ""Spanish Guitar."""
2,Spanish Guitar...typical Toni by far.,"I was almost disappointed in the verbal content of the album (especially ""Speaking In Tongues"" which I found to be blasphemous to those who really comprehend what ""Speaking in Tongues is), and counted it as a bad investment until I heard ""Spanish Guitar"". Being more of a jazz aficionado, it's Toni's sultry voice that appeals to me most. Again, the verbal content is a bit for the younger, single audience but I think ""Spanish Guitar"" will appeal to the more mature audience. I hope it's made into a single!"
1,don't waist your money unless....,"i don't know about you, but when i heard ""he wasn't man enough for me"" i thought the rest of the album would be just as good if not better, and that at list there will be some tracks which will be ""single honored"", but... I WAS WRONG! the album ..., and exepct from 3 songs, which are a bit upbeat and fast paced, the rest is mostly ballads, boring ones, and non of them seem to be as a single... unless you love this kind of music, or you are a toni fan, don't buy this album. instead, by survivor by destiny's child! ( a great album!!!!!)"
1,Bummer album from a great singer,"Was this album a dissapointment!! I love Toni Braxton's voice and I especially liked her first album and the second one(although not as much as the first one) but this one is a bore. The only good songs are: He wasn't man enough for me, Spanish Guitar and Never One for a Ring. The rest is just plain terrible. I hope her next offering is better. Don't waste your money on this one. With that voice, she can do a lot better."
5,Just be a man about it,Toni said the words and she also song the words. This new album The Heat is on the money. I 'm a Toni Braxton fan and when I first purchased the album I felt a little diappointed until i really set down one day and really listen to the whole album. Girlfriend has really expressed herself in the making of this album. You go Toni
3,Hot Shot - not so Hot,"As a frequent flyer, SEP books help me thru bumpy takeoffs and landings. Not so this one. This book didnt get me interested until Mitch appeared on the scene. I hated Sam and wanted to slap 'Susie'. But here I was 35,000 feet over nowhere so I finished the book in 3 hours. There was no clever banter back and forth as there is with her other books. Mitch came close. I give SEP an ""A"" for research on the computer business and will continue to seek out her other books."
4,Hot Shot just a little on the cool side.,"OK, Susan Elizabeth Phillips is one of my favourite authors - her books are a ""go-to"" when I just want to enjoy a good read and be put in a good mood. I have given 'Hot Shot' an ""I liked it"" rating, but unlike some of her other books, it definitely wasn't an ""I loved it"" experience. Most of SEP's characters & story lines grab me and pull me into the book, but not this one. But, looking on the brightside - it made it easier to put the book down at a sensible hour, turn out the light and get some much needed sleep."
5,It is everything it promises to be.,The Scunci is superior to any other steam cleaner out there on the market. The steam has more than enough pressure to take care of the job. Several other brands I tried were weak by comparison.
1,If there were an option for no stars . . .,"Save your money and your time. I recommend leaving this potshot at the Native American non-fiction genre in the pile of unread books next to the rest of the myth-and-legend creation stories written and edited by ""white"" authors where it belongs. The problem is not Fuller's overambitious and sometimes nonsensical prose, the lack of basic evidence to support much of what he deems factual within the text itself, or the fact that Fuller himself presents fuzzy portrait of the man he is trying to recognize. The words of Yellowhorse himself are absent from this book; in that emptiness, there is little left that furthers the recognition of the integrity of Native Peoples in history, aside from that which has been outlined being of great importance in conventional, non-Native society."
5,Love Wham,"""Wham"" became popular when my children were teenagers and I really loved their upbeat music. Had to have the older tunes that made them popular!"
4,"Wham, Bam, these Young Guns WERE the Men...","From '82 to '86, these two young handsome Brits were a huge hit on both sides of the Atlantic, with Dance-Pop hits like ""I'm Your Man"" and ""Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go"". The other good songs I still like to this day, with me being way too young to be a fan of this duo in the '80's, are ""If You Were There"", the original version of ""Everything She Wants"", the original, really poppy sound of ""Freedom"", ""The Edge Of Heaven"", ""Wham Rap!"", ""Young Guns (Go For It!)"", and the two remixes at the end, however, ""I'm Your Man '96"" doesn't quite sound nearly as appealing as it's original version. All in all, this was certainly the standard stepping stone for a legend in the making in pop music, George Michael. This collection truly compiles the best of Wham!, that's for sure. It's worth a listen, pick it up sometime soon!"
4,mattress cover,"fits well, well madethis is a quality item that I would purchase again.It is heavyweight and well worth the price"
3,California queen is NOT a california queen,"I bought this vinyl sheet to cover my new mattress from a dog w/ a peeing problem. It has just arrived so I cannot review its durability. Also, as some other reviewers have noted, it does not smell strongly of plastic and that is a plus. It is ALMOST as described. It is the correct color and size as described by the seller. HOWEVER, I ordered a California Queen, as I do not have a regular queen size mattress. The product on Amazon's website is described as being 9 inches deep and this is correct however the sheet does not completely cover my mattress because as described, it is only 9 inches deep. Why have an option for a california queen or a california king if the deepness is the same as a regular king or queen? Save your money and order the regular size or spend a bit more and get a REAL vinyl california king/queen mattress cover."
5,Pain and Suffering Never Felt This Good,"Bill Callahan has created a masterpiece that is really beyond words. All I can say is that if you've recently had your heart torn out and stepped on with a pair of soccer cleats, THIS is the album for you. Tenderness and nostalgia, bitterness and despair, Doctor Came At Dawn is frighteningly accurate in its depiction of a breakup you can only relate to. Be prepared to reach for the Kleenex... Smog you're a genius."
3,"Incomplete and outdated, but still handy","The book covers detective fiction up to the 1970's. It's arranged in 5 parts: Detectives, Rogues & Helpers, Cases, and Movies, with a final section that lists authors and their works.Each of the first four sections presents a brief description of each item in the category. The final section lists authors alphabetically, with works and publication date. The list of works is incomplete (omitting several pre-70's novels).Still, it's a handy collection of summary information on detective fiction."
3,Takes some practice,"The blade is a good product but the vibrating nature of the tool itself is hard to control when doing small projects. You need a lot of practice before using it. It is very difficult to cut a straight line with.wood. Works very well with sheetrock especially in conjunction with the fein vacuum tied in to suck up the dust. I haven't tried to cut a nail with it yet so I don't know if it would take care of that task. These blades wear out fairly fast and the cost is high, can't afford to use it every day!"
3,Ok deal.,"Beware that these are not as wide as the blades that come with your fein. They work great, just wish they were the wide ones."
5,These are Genuine at lower cost,I previously posted a review while I checked on the different imprint I saw on these blades versus the 'normal' Metal + Wood (with Metall + Holz also imprinted on the blade). I now find on the Fein web site that the different logo on the blades I received is also genuine. So I am updating my review. The photo on Amazon.com should be updated to avoid confusion. But the blades are indeed genuine.
1,poor quality blades,The first blade out of the pack separated at the welds immediately. I'm on the second one now. For this much money they shouldn't fall apart.
5,Fein 1 3/4 e-cut blade review,"These blades are made for the Fein, so they fit, I have tried a universal blade and it would not fit the saw. The price was right compared to buying them off the shelf. This is the blade I use the most on projects."
1,"fein universal cut,",the blades are worthless. they wear out very easily and quickly. other companies make similar oscillating tools at a lower cost with more blade selections. Definitely stay away from the multimaster tool and blades. I gave this a 1 start because it is the lowest option available. I would give it negative stars if they were available.
3,Wider blades are generally more useful,"I ordered these because they were on a special, but the wider (1-3/4"") blades are generally more useful."
5,The Fools who do not do their homework,"Imagine reading the review of a fool who obviously knows nothing abiout singing who tells us ""Callas has no talent."" I guess this person never heard of Steane,Ardoin,Crutchfield,and all the other great musical journalists and critics..respected in their field.. Callas is noit a voice ""for all tastes,"" but if people decide to do their HOMEWORK..explore her art..the phrasing,the attention to text and line....only then can they have any credibility..I read reviews here by total morons who know so little..it is so sad..and they actually think they know what they are saying......No one deserves credibility until they can show specific examples as taken from the callas art..or ANY art.....and how many times did they see her..how many tapes do they own 9especially 1949-1955.)Do not listen to these people..read...listen..study....Maria deserves it..not the foolish and childish things i read...CH"
3,100 pounds my *^^*,"Unit is great for storing our dog food. And the stacking feature is nice also. BUT! a 40 puond bag of science diet dog food pretty much fills it.So who ever spect this out to hold a hundred pounds must have been stoned when they did it.So if you want a nice stackable food storage unit this will fit the bill, just double the size that you need."
5,Patio Pagoda Review,"I was very pleased with this purchase. This patio cover is very easy to assemble as it uses lock-buttons built into the frame, not screws or nuts/bolts. I had the entire frame assembled w/o any help in about 30 minutes. The installation of top cover, insect screens and privacy curtains took another 20 minutes. It seems very well built and I've already rec'd several neighbor's compliments. Sportman's delivered it quickly and on-time. I found a identical version at Walmart for $100 less, but it must have had hundreds of screws in it and did not include privacy curtains. It's perfect for a protected patio. It does come with wimpy stakes to secure it on dirt/grass, but I doubt it would keep high winds from turning this into a ""flying pagoda"" ;-)"
2,Working hard to stay in the spotlight,"Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg was featured on 60 Minutes as the untrammeled artist who couldn't be stopped, the underdog who swooned and swayed onstage, lost in her expressive rapture. That's what her fans expect, and she more or less lives up to the image here. This is very wayward playing, in which the soloist bends over backwards to keep the spotlight on herself. As a result of ignoring the composer, the score is pulled around like taffy.Perhaps this is the new romanticism, and I would be thrilled if NSS's ideas were fascinating. But on the whole she swoops and exaggerates for no other purpose than ego display. There are breathless pauses and sudden leaps of excitement that make no sense. Tilson Thomas plays along by forgetting the tempo and waiting for his soloist to get through her next stunt.It's funny, because I am all in favor of NSS's shtick about artistic freedom, but this junky Sibelius concerto is her personal trip, pure and simple."
3,"Looks like fun, but maybe for older kids","It says that from 12-month... My son is 14-month old, he likes to push on the buttons and take all the pieces out of the bus. But he looses the interest really fast, because first of all it is too difficult to match up the shapes and put them in the right place, and then it is not comfortable to put the pieces back in. Would not buy this toy for a gift for any of my friends."
4,"Flawless, but bloodless","Compared with the recording by her predecessor in 4-string phenom-hood, Midori, Chang's is smoother, more polished, and more musical - especially in the ultra-high range. So as a demonstration of virtuosity, I suppose Chang has to get the nod. But even in the music of Paganini, chops aren't everything. Where is the crowd-pleasing theatricality, the joy in untrammeled mastery? If you can't sound like you're having fun when you're playing a juicy cheeseburger of a concerto like this one, maybe you spent a little too much time practicing your instrument."
1,Look at the listing...,"Claims to be a ""Michigan St. Spartans"" helmet and shows a picture of a Michigan Wolverines helmet. If this is truly sold by Riddell, they need to learn something about the teams that make products for."
5,Great method! It worked on me,"TheThe Bates Method for Better Eyesight Without GlassesThis method worked cfor me! I have not worn any corrective lenses fir over two months, and can see better than I ever have, using the method.I am 74 years old and have been wearing glasses since I was 8. When I was in my early teens my mother hired a tutor in this method, since I was very nearsighted and it was then very new information. (the book was published in the early 1940's). I was not successful, becasue I wouldn't follow all the instructions. In late 2008 I remembered the method, searched the internet, and bought the book. This time it worked.I am very excited to be free of glasses after 66 years, though I have to be careful about putting on protective glasses when I work in my woodworking shop.The book itself is of course dated and very technical, but I wanted to go to the source, since there are a lot of newer books using the method.WoodJack"
3,Classic Book but Difficult to Read,"This is certainly the classic and authoritive book on bates' eye improvement. However, I recommend recent good books such as ""Relearning to See"" if you are interested in the detailed theory and techniques in this field."
3,Mean as Hell,"I have a few copies of this book, for my son and sister. Attorney Sidney Bateman was my grandfather.Mr Harkey's book presents an interesting and authentic perspective on the Old West and old New Mexico in particular.Jennifer Devenot -Kaneohe,Hawaii"
4,Does the job.,"Very sturdy piece of furniture. It is a dust collector as mentioned by previous reviews, but you don't really notice unless you're up close or looking for it. Solid product."
4,"Good stand, but a pain to assemble","I opted not to mount the TV (a 50 inch plasma) on the swiveling stand, because the TV came with a stand attached and I didn't want to hassle to get it off. It would have been very helpful to have written directions on how to assemble this very heavy stand, rather than schematics. It took me an hour with the help of two motivated daughters. One other negative-the black glass of the shelves look very dirty very quickly. Clear glass shelves would have been a better choice. But overall, well-made hardware despite source of origin."
4,First flat screen tv stand,"This stand was packaged up very well. A good thing seeings how the carrier had dropped it on one corner. Thought for sure the glass shelves would be broken.. but nope. All parts and pieces were fine, assembly was easy and it supports my 60"" plasma even though only rated for up to 52"" TV's.About the only draw back I really find is the fact the TV doesn't lock onto the stand in any way, just kinda sits in place and held on with a small set screw..Dave"
2,I am Bored,"Average storyline from the 1950's, taken from existential plays, Matheson's writing style doesn't really seem important enough to give us an edge towards the book. All the character does is ""drink all day and smoke"". He seems to have left the book awhile before returning to the ending which seemed far fetched and absurd. Other stories in here include boring cliched type horror stuff that isnt really stimulating. This book would have been good if I was 14 but now it is just average."
3,Don't understand what all the hype was about......,"All I heard about was what a great vampire book this was, and while it wasn't terrible and was certainly well written, it lacked the oomph that todays vampire novels have. If you want to read about vampires I recommend the the truely poetic and literary writings of Anne Rice her Vampire Chronicals series, it leaves this one in the dust. All the Lestat book are great, but skip, Pandora, Blood and Gold and Armand and pick up again with Merrick and Blackwood Farms the latter is in my opinion her best novel yet! Also, Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Baker Vampire hunter is a great series, although not as literary."
3,Give it a chance,"I guess I really don't like Vampire stories, if this tautly written classic filled with rich description, and keen insights into the human condition, can't hold my interest, then there's no hope for me. Even though I didn't enjoy the book as much as others have, I can certainly understand why it has achieved legendary status among fans of the genre. Unlike a lot of post-apocalyptic tales from this era, it has held up surprisingly well despite the 50+ years since it's first publication. Matheson's writing is on par with Heinlein, Dick, and the other masters of science fiction. Give this story a chance, I hope you like it more than I did."
4,A Scientific Look At The Vampire Disease,"This is the quintessential vampire book. I first read this ten years ago when I was looking for something 'classic' about vampires. It was either Matheson or Ann Rice. Ann Rice has NOTHING on Matheson. Matheson is to vampires what Asimov is to robots.Anyway - what drew me in is that the story itself is relatively short (aproximately 150 pages) but deeply engaging. Matheson seeks to explain the vampire scientifically. I am, however, disappointed in the ending - it just didnt do it for me, hence I give it only four stars.As an added bonus this book contains roughly 10 more short stories of Matheson's which are all very entertaining. Matheson was a writer for the Twilight Zone (remember William Shatner exclaiming 'there's something on the wing!' yeah Matheson wrote that story) - he does not disappoint!"
3,Not quite what it should be,"I read this because some science fiction critic said it was ""better than Robinson Crusoe.""Not quite.""I am Legend"" is a pretty compelling metaphor for isolation (and isolationism), but the author lets a lot of that tension run to waste by devoting the middle portion of the story to a bogus Freudian/science-fictional explanation of where the vampires came from, why crosses repel them, blah blah blah...I suppose it's an important contribution to the evolving vampire mythos (though I'm not sure that's a good thing if ""Twilight"" is what we get from it), but it could have been something even better: a truly atmospheric story throughout. That, to me, would have been even more valuable."
3,good original story,"Good original story but the title was misleading,it should have said The Legend and other short stories,The story kind of left me hanging, I kept flipping back and forth until I realized the story was over and a new short story was beginning. The movie was better"
2,Book misrepresented as a full novel!,"Although the title story of this book was good enough, it left me deeply disappointed when I reached the end (after only 170 pages!) On no spot, except a small area on the back cover (which many readers avoid to prevent spoilers) does it state that this is not a full novel, but an anthology of short stories. I felt especially sore after investing my twelve dollars on this softcover collection. I will not say that ""I am Legend"" was not a good story in and of itself, but when a reader anticipates another several hundred pages and turns the page and realizes the story had already ended, there is a sense of being cheated. Praise for the author's ""short story"", but shame on the publisher for misrepresenting it's product and tricking the consumer!"
5,Vampires for the Rational Mind,"Matheson's take on the vampire legends is a quantum jump beyond the nightmarish images conjured by writers from Bram Stoker to Anne Rice, yet presents an even more profound nightmare. A man, Robert Neville, imperfect, realistic and brave in the face of overwhelming circumstances, refuses to abandon hope even though he recognizes the very real possibility that he may be the last of his kind. Neville's desperate grasping at one last hope leads to an unexpected and provocative ending, leaving the reader with a glimpse of primal imperatives rarely sensed in literature attuned to modern, sophisticated sensitivities. It is a reminder that the word, sophisticated, is derived from the same root as sophistry."
3,"Only half the book is actually the story, ""I Am Legend.""","Beware: while this book is 300+ pages long, only about 170 of those pages is the story, ""I Am Legend."" What follows is a handful of short stories not related at all to the main story line. They are a collection of stories written by the same author. If I would have known this I probably would not have purchased this copy. However, the book ""I Am Legend"", while much different from the movie and much shorter than anticipated, was worth the read."
3,Nice job,"I've been listening to audio books from the State Library for over 30 years and received a copy of this through unabridged.com. I thought it was pretty well done. Maybe coulda done without the WC Fields impression in one story, but the rest were very good.A previous reviewer said ""the stories were dated"" - the book was originally published in 1954 and the story in the book is MUCH better than the current movie which was VERY badly done trying to make the story ""HIP"" - Wasn't Will Smith's fault - just bad direction.I will definitely be ""reading"" this book again. Good Science Fiction/horror NEVER gets old."
2,"Great first half, terrible second half!","The first half of this book was very engrossing. I don't even know what to say about the second half...I would love it if someone could explain to me what the heck it was about!! I hated the last half of this book...it made no sense. I just kept thinking that it would all come together and make sense at some point, and it never did. Thankfully, the movie was very different from the book."
1,WARNING!!!!!,"If you see this BEFORE you purchase (wish I had done some checking before I purchased...) be advised the ""I am Legend"" story encompasses about half the boook's size...the remainder is a series of very (VERY) short stories that are completely and totally unrelated to the title of the ""book"", as well as to each other. I learned after the fact that I was not the only one to be completely confused while my brain was trying to make the leap from the main story to what I had waded into after finishing ""I am Legend."" The title story itself was ok, however, had I realized I was paying for such a tiny little read I would have left it on the shelf."
4,Great book,"This is a very entertaining, albeit pretty short (170pgs) book and I would recommend it to anyone that likes survival type stories.Only problem is that now I don't think the movie will be anything near how good the book was."
4,Matheson's Legend,"Matheson is a master craftsmen of the sci-fi and horror genre. This novel is no exception and is my favorite thus far. Only four stars though because the ending left something to be desired, at least for me. Still good, but I've read a better ending in his shorter stories. But definitely check it out - it's a great read."
2,"Part Good, Part Bad","I was interested in listening to the audio presentation of 'I Am Legend' and was not disappointed in it. The story differs greatly from the movie and it was a pleasure to hear it. The narrator of that story did a great job.However, when I got to the 'Other Stories' part of the audio book (about 4-5 disks into the 10 disk set), I found myself very disappointed by the poor narration (performed by a different narrator). I suppose some of the stories might have been ok, but like a previous reviewer, I stopped listening at about disk 7 because I couldn't stand listening to the narrator anymore ... couldn't even force myself. I've listened to a lot of audio books because I do so much driving and of the hundreds of books I've read this narrator was by far the worst. The short stories weren't Mattheson's best. I have read many of his short stories and liked others much better.My recommendation would be to find another audio version of I Am Legend that doesn't include the short stories."
2,TOO SHORT!!,"I didn't know it was a book of short stories!I Am Legend was too short for me~! Is that it??Half of the book was other short stories, I felt ripped off!I thought I am Legend was too simple, vampires,, snore!I will not see the movie."
2,A Disappointment,"I don't typically read vampire novels, but when a friend tossed I Am Legend my way I gave it a shot. If this is 'one of the best vampire novels out there,' then I will never read another one. The premise of the story is looking at vampires from a biological perspective, and the author never substantively departs from that single idea. Even then, Matheson fails to make his vampires original in any sense. The book's action is weak, emotional appeals are less than compelling, and there is virtually no horror. Skip this one."
3,"The Opening Story is Great, the Rest is Garbage","""I Am Legend"", the title work of this anthology, is a classic vampire novel and very well written. I enjoyed it and would give it 4 or maybe 5 stars.My problem with this collection though is that every other story in the book is terrible. I would give all of them 1 star. I literally had to make myself read some of them. I don't know if they were included as filler or if the author was just using the first story as a hook to get people to read his other stuff, or what the deal is, but they don't even read like they're by the same personThe only thing I can think is either they are very early work or something he threw together just to run up the page count. I say all this to tell you if you can find ""I Am Legend"" by itself for cheaper than this version is listed for, get that instead. There is nothing other than that story worth spending your time on hereTo sum up: Definately read I Am Legend, just read it by itself."
3,Beyond I am Legend,"Aside from I Am Legend which after watching both movies based on this book I deem ""The Omega Man"" to follow the book much closer then ""I am Legend."" Easy to read and enjoyable. Good story. Following I am Legend are 10 short stories. Strange and interesting. Some of the prose is rich and wordy, a huge difference in writing style then I am Legend. Weird and creepy are some. Was dissapointed at first that half way through the book the story ended then there was this ""other stuff"" however I have found the reading of these other short stories to be quite entertaining. Because of these I will pass this book to my daughter."
4,The dead book of the year!,"I really liked this book because it was interesting. When I first read this book I didn't understand it really. Then when I read this book again I understood it better. This book is hard to understand, and the book is more for adults and young adults because it has bad language in it. The book has one big novel which is I am legend and the rest of the book has scary stories in it. My favorite story is ""Prey"", because it has a lot of mystery and suspense in it. I would recommend this book to older readers because of the language."
4,Good read,It's a very good story and quite different from the movie version. I finished it in a couple of days.
4,3.5 stars,"This is an enjoyable novella and very reasonably priced. I liked in particular that you're given one man to follow through his experience with ""vampires"". That decision helps to create a wealth of questions in the reader's mind and also build an appropriate sense of dread.I'm glad I saw the movie before reading the book, because if it had been in reverse I would have been disappointed by how Hollywood switched a lot of Matheson's stuff around.If you're looking for other novella's with a similar feel to them, try Stephen King's UR and Ralph Lagana's The Monkey's Paw Trilogy."
2,It was OK,"I bought this book in anticipation of the film starring Will Smith. I must say it was a very short story. I continued on into the short stories afterward thinking I was still reading I am Legend, only to quickly realize they had nothing to do with it. I was very disappointed. I suppose I should have looked over some of the other customer reviews first.I would not have bought this had I known that merely half the book is I am Legend. I gave it 2 stars because at least what I read was interesting enough. I hope the movie is better and doesn't end the way the book did."
3,not a fan,"i read it and i was sadly very disappointed. no i never watched to movie and actually bought it before i knew it even was a movie. the beginning was ok, slow but ok, but it never picked up. i really didnt like the idea of the vampires, was obnoxious from a vampire-lover's perspective but the bateria idea seemed interesting enough if you could get past that. nothing happened though and the ending was horribly corny, probably bc the bk was written in the 50s than it wasnt ""corny"" yet, well, now it is. srry dude. he sits around listening to records and moping and rarely goes outside. the dog seemed kinda pointless bc it's only in a few scenes and SPOILER, dies shortly after."
3,I read it when I was 19 and didn't do it for me even as a kid,"Ok, so this is one of books that originated survival thriller/horror genre, but for me it wasn't so big. I guess it was writing style that I disliked.Lord knows I read every novel or story by real writers who wrote horror (Edgar Allan Poe , Ambrose Bierce) and writer-entertainers like Clive Barker, Stephen King, Howard Phillips Lovecraft. I loved everything when I was 18-19 , fiction, science fiction, epic fiction, horror and read even the worst books to the end, including James Herbert's 'Survivor' . OMG, was THAT one bad!"
1,Defective Audio Book,"Not so much about the content, but the item is defective. I purchased this new off AMazon and disc 2 was blank. My replacement copy disc 2 is again defective."
1,You might do well to see the movie instead ...,"... of reading the story. I found it thin and unconvincing. The ""vampire"" stuff is highly implausible, and the ending -- I'll not reveal it in a review -- sentious and pretentious."
2,Definately not his best work...,"This is a story about the sole survivor of a plague that has turned the world's population into varying forms of vampires. While the idea behind the story itself is intriguing, it feels more like reading an anthropological study than a horror novel. The whole novel is filled with the protagonist repeating the same actions and his reactions to those actions over and over again.There is little in the way of plot, rather the story plods along aimlessly. Matheson may have done this intentionally to convey the protagonist's uncertainty about the past, present, and future. Nonetheless, it makes for a less than gripping read.Matheson's writing style is, at best, mediocre in this novel. I had to force myself to finish reading it. On the plus side though, it did have a good ending. If you're new to Matheson and must read something of his, pick up Hell House, a far superior novel."
4,Good reading,"Good reading and interesting enough to make it a fast read. I was a littel surprised to find out that I am Legend is a short story. It is followed by many other, much shorter stories. My wife read the book too. She felt there was not a good line of demarcation between I am Legend and the following stories--so much that she was surprised and thought the book was hard to follow.I am Legend though is definitely worth the read. The character is well developed by the end and the story is hard to put down."
3,"""I Am Legend"" is a Good Story, but...","... I bought thinking it was a novel. It turns out to be a collection of short stories, with the novella 'I Am Legend' in the front. I did enjoy the story, despite the main character being a blond 40ish Irishman and not African American (like Will Smith on the cover). However, I couldn't really get into the short stories. Felt like I over-paid for the content inside this book; four stars for the main story, two stars for the 'bait and switch' short story filler."
2,Go see the movie...,"I wouldn't call this a novel, it's more of a novella with additional short stories. The book was a bit of a let down and the ""buzz price"" of $11 was not (IMHO) worth it. Save your money and go see the movie.."
2,YUCK.....,"Book is much better than the movie, but the ending sucks. The solitude of the main character was interesting, especially for the decade this was written. But it falls short on a lot of explaination. There were a lot of opportunities to really explore the psychological aspects of an isolated man left dangling.The short stories (most of which were featured on the twilight zone) inserted at the back of the book by the publishing company were a lot more enjoyable than the main story. Save yourself a headache, rent the movie, or wait for it on cable."
4,Delicious horror,"I had first read this story when the movie came out. But, realizing that (as usual) the story far outweighed the movie in terms of plot and twists, I continued reading the other shorts within. The combination of thought provoking characters and horror elements really makes for some delightful scares. Keep the nightlight on."
2,overpriced,"The is not a 25 count of rolls of bags. This is 1 count roll of 25 plastic bags. The product itself is good, but not for $10."
4,Great costume except for the shoe covers,"The costume overall is great, I guess I was just a little disappointed in the feet portion of the pants. I bought a bigger size for my 6 year old and the shoe covers attatched to the pants don't fully cover his feet. He's only going to get bigger. Fits great otherwise."
1,Not what is pictured,"The quality of the costume was very low and not what is pictured. The material on the shirt/tunic did not have finished edges (as shown) but was rough cut and already fraying when it arrived. The material itself was very thin, a different color and impossible to get the wrinkles out. If you want something that does not look like you cut it out of a sheet, do not purchase this item. I returned it, five days before Halloween."
2,Cheaply made and way over priced,"It should work for the one night it is needed. Don't think the ""boots"" will hold up even through one wear. Really over priced. The costume in the bag doesn't even match the packaging. It is about what should be expected for this type of costume, but the price tag doesn't match. It should probably be about half the price. My youngest son's costume is a WAY better quality for a whole lot less. Would never have bought this if I'd found a better option. My little guy had his heart set on being a jedi and I couldn't talk him out of it. If you have even the slightest sewing ability, you could make something much nicer and cuter. Too bad my little jedi's mom isn't craftier."
5,Great entertainment for the whole family!,"We love A. O. stories, They are so funny and entertaining, while teaching good principals. We listen to them over and over again at any age."
4,"A labor of love, but the songs aren't first rate","As a concept album, Hampson's 1997 tribute to Walt Whitman earned critical praise for its sensitivity and musicality. There's no doubt that the singer is in rare form here--it would be hard to imagine any of this repertoire sung with more passion and conviction. He isn't a good reciter of poetry in the four spoken tracks. The major drawback, however, is that few of these songs are close to being masterpieces -- Bernstein's late ""To what you said"" stands out -- and quite a number are decidedly cautious.The avid listener can cncentrate on the poetry instead of the music, I suppose--Hampson's enunciation is crystal clear--but after six or seven items couched in the same rather timid Anglo-American art song idiom, this labor of love becomes rather taxing as a listening experience. Taken a few at a time, however, these are intriguing choices that combine into a unqiue recital."
1,Why do y'all like this book so much?,"I read this book a few years ago for my English Class, and I seriously thought it was the worst novel I'd ever read. Not only was almost unbearably insipid, it was so depressing and ugly that if it could have drawn me in enough to have cared about it, I would have been filled with only negative emotions such as grief and sadness."
1,It's great...,...if you don't want your kid to go too far. Poor design makes the wheels impossible to turn. Both my kids walked away from it in less than five minutes. I will say this...at least they don't fight over it.
2,Not worth it!!!,"This toy was a gift for my 2 year old son who would love it if the wheels and mounted sound base didn't fall off constantly...On the rare occasion that the wheels do stay on the axle, the problem is that they do not turn! They stick to the axle without turning. We will be returning this toy ASAP. Thank goodness for gift vouchers!"
2,"looks good, sounds good, sucks to use","I know this phone is not available and probably no one is ever going to read this review, I thought I put it in anyway after a good 1 hour of trying to set and learn the darn thing tonight. The radio/phone looks pretty good, the stereo sound is very decent as well, but using it is a bi-tch. You have to go through 3 buttons just to turn the stations. And if you set the sleep mode, hope you are not falling sleep and trying to turn the thing off early, you have to locate the little radio on/off button instead of the usual big round SNOOZE button. Setting up the alarm is way too complicated. The volume actually in my personal opinion is a little too loud. Level 1 is enough to keep you sober on a drunken night :) I am just going to use the basic feature of this unit, not gonna go bother with the ""fancy"" features."
3,Hampered by Cheesy Male Vocals,"In the world of electronica, there is an overabundance of very cheesy female vocal tracks. Highly evident in the genre of trance.Not so on Chevy Martin's ""Just Lounge"". Instead, it is crawling with lame male vocals. Too bad as the actual music to a lot of the tracks featured on this compilation is pretty good, but I just can't listen past the brainless lyrics.The opener, ""Everybody Dance"" is a gem of a track. The other two track noteables include, ""Beautiful Day"" and ""Just Another Friday"". The remaining tracks are average or below average in my opinion (and mostly for the reason stated above). Another minus is the album is unmixed.I suggest a pass on purchasing this one.3/5 stars."
3,Great!,Just what I ordered. Since it was labeled as a used item I expected a few tears or bends on the pages. It was still in great condition.
2,Parkening's interpretation is lacking.,"Parkening's version of the Aranjuez is severely lacking in musicallity and emotional interpretation. This may be due to how the CD was recorded, in that, the RPO recorded its part and then Parkening dubbed in his part at a later time. This is highly dubious and definitely works as a disadvantage for the overall interpretation of the work. Parkening's performance may be technically acceptable, but for those who want a performance of the Aranjuez that is not only technically dazzling, but is also emotionally rich and musically fullfilling, buy Pepe Romero's recording with the Academy-of-St. Martin's-in the Field under Sir Neville Marriner released in 1994. Not only is it the definitive recording, but it was one of the composer's favorite recordings of his concerto."
3,Book review,This book was what I expected it to be. I only bought it because I like Bill Clinton and was mildly curious. I don't hold anyone in high regard who does what she did and the writes a book about it. Mostly because of the repercussions on the family. To bad stories like this reek so much collatoral damage.
1,Dull as dirt,"""Younger and Younger"" is a bizarre and irksome movie.Jonathan Younger appears to be a successful businessman, but actually depends on his unappreciated wife, Penny, to do all the work. Jonathan manages to get around, and one day when Penny hears him having an affair, she dies on the office floor (sounds highly improbable to me). Jonathan is apathetic at first, but starts seeing the ghost of his wife everywhere he looks.Meanwhile, Jonathan's son, Winston, comes home from Europe to help keep up the company. Winston is swamped by his new duties, and receives no help whatsoever from his daydreaming father.Somewhere along the way, Winston gains a foreign girlfriend and Jonathan and Penny are finally united forever.The plot is utterly ridiculous, and the director does not bother to explain several peculiar moments. This movie is ultimately boresome, and its only positive element is Brendan Fraser."
4,New and improved,"This newer version is easier to read,has better definitions and has some newer terms that were not in the previous edition."
4,"The segmented plates aren't the best out there, but the unsegmented are great!","The dividers on the segmented plates are not rounded so these plates are hard to clean. You'd be better off buying the cheap plastic segmented plates at Walmart. That being said, the basic plates that are not divided are GREAT. I didn't really start using these plates much until after my son was older and had learned not to throw his plate since these have no suction to keep them in place. The lids are awesome for a finicky toddler because if he refuses dinner I can snap the lid on, pop it in the fridge, and pull it back out when he's hungry. I originally gave this product a bad review, but I have a much higher opinion of it now that my son is older."
4,Underrated Keaton Gem,"Despite his personal troubles during the early 1930s, Buster Keaton reveals another dimension of his comic talent in ""Speak Easily."" He gives a splendid performance as Timolean Zanders Post, an isolated professor who believes he has inherited $750,000. With this mistaken financial security, he manages a struggling vaudeville troupe that he takes to Broadway. ""Speak Easily"" was the second MGM film to pair Keaton with Jimmy Durante. Though an unusual combination, they work remarkably well in this enjoyable musical-comedy - one of the few movies that displays Keaton's flair for verbal humor. The result is the best of Keaton's MGM talkies."
3,Not the Worst of the MGM's,"Keaton made worst movies that this for MGM - Free and Easy is the one that springs to my mind. In saying that this is no masterpiece, far from it.The storyline leads to what should be a funny movie and parts of this are, for instance the scene with Thelma Todd at the hotel room (BTW love that drinks cabinet) and the morning after. I also like the little bit at the beginning with the train. And I like the Theatre Scenes at the end of the movie.But like nearly everyone here we all know what was to come after so we know that this is the beginning of the end for Keaton at MGM. Durante and Keaton are not a good mix, Cliff Edwards and Keaton would have been much better combination."
5,McHale's should be in the Hall of Fame for TV series,"Very seldom in the past 35 years has any TV station I get rerun McHale's Navy. Thus I was thrilled to see Season 1 offered on Amazon. This series is truly one of television's funniest shows ever. The interaction between the Captain and Ensign Parker (Joe Flynn and Tim Conway) was fabulous!The DVD shows are packaged nicely and the pictures quite clear. My only beef is on first inserting the first disc, I had to sit through several ads for other DVDs--I could not fast forward or skip them. But to see this great series again, it's worth that inconvenience. On the first disc was a nice feature with five of the regulars recalling the series. Can't wait for the remaining seasons to be offered."
4,Lee's trip down memory lane,Crookyln involes Spike Lee's trip down memory lane and it's a memorable one. The cinematography and script are all excellent as always and the soundtrack represents the seventies very well. The film's only down point is that it's a bit long but still a great heartwarming film.
5,Wonderful,"I never saw the film but did have the album when it was on the store shelves in the 70's.It turned ou to be one of my favorite albums the more I listened to it.This album grows on you,I would sure like to see it listed again but in a cd format, or higher quality format.Now that the BluRay & High Def DVD war is over I would love to see the film on BluRay. It is one I would purchase at a reasonable rate."
5,Best of Orchestral Manoeuvers in the Dark,I had this music in album form when it first came out and it was super deserving of 5 stars or better. Wished I could find it again.
5,An Awesome CD to add to your collection!,"I originally bought this CD for the well-known ""If You Leave"" track. I honestly never listened to any other songs until my husband and I went on a road trip. It is AWESOME! Honestly, I was just a little kid in the 80's but have always loved the music. And this CD is a great one to have if you're trying to build up a good 80's collection! The best songs (in my opinion) on the CD are: Electricity, Enola Gay, Souvenir, So in Love, Secret, If You Leave, and (my husband's favorite) Dreaming. Get this CD...you'll love it!"
4,Nice touch,"A good example of what a ""best of"" collection should be. This is one of the most likeable synth-pop sounds ever."
3,Unbiased Review,"Not as great as his previous commercial release with ""Get Rich or Die Tryin'"" but don't sell the LP short yet. Dre, Eminem, Needlz among others do fantastic production work on the beats. Lyrically its not remotely close to ""Get Rich.."" but its better than most of the garbage commercial music has been putting out recently. Still he could have done without the easy method to sell records by voicing his beefs on tracks like 'Piggy Bank' but thats his M.O. and his selling point. So, he does what he says he does.This album starts out slower than what you would expect but picks up with a lot of sure-fire club beats that are gonna probably blow up like ""In the Club"" so expect more of the same. Wavers near the end of the album too. Still, don't hate before you hear; make the decision yourself. Its worth a listen thru or two and won't hurt your current collection.An honest review because it seems too many people take ""sides"" these days. Like he says in the end, you'll hate it or love it."
1,Here are my 2 Cents,Not much else I can say about this CD that hasn't already been said. There are some decent beats on this album and that's why I gave it 1 star. 50 Cent is a bad rapper (and even those that enjoy this album should agree). He has nothing new to offer. Listen to his song with Eminem to see the huge gap in talent. I highly recommend that you spend your $ somewhere else. This CD will get old really quick.
3,ok,"ok cd, suck a*s lyrics, best songs r candy shop,in my hood, disco inferno, just a lil bit and hate it or love it remix"
1,this sh*t be fat and stupid!,"hip hop is so gay, i don't see why it's so popular. Rap used to stand for something back in the ninetys, now it's all about stars and their cars. Any one listening to this is probably some twelve year old thinking he knows good music, or some faggy little skateboarder who lip sycs to the fresh lyrics of this jackass or that retard Kanye West. P.S the dancing in Hip hop videos look so gay, everyone will notice this by 2006, I gaurantee."
4,ncie one,the massacre was a pretty good album from 50 cent. that has songs that is very gangsta. and is the most anticipated cd of 2005.
1,The Massacre (nawww dawg the bull crap),"This is 50 cent's 4th album and by far the worst looks like the order his albums come out in the more crapper they get.22 tracks and 7 good ones oh come on!the 3 scott storch songs yeh,the 2 dre beats ofcorse boy,disco inferno hell yes,so amazing so brilliant dawg.The rest speak for themselves.For 50 cent you say game is nothing without u well that may be true kid but ur nothing without dre and it shows on your pathetic excuse of an album!"
2,Sophomore Slump,"Just when 50 said he wasn't gonna have a sophomore slump he did. Relative to many albums out this album is trash. He has the nerve to hate on Game, he's just jeolous because 50 knew coming in that his album couldnt hold a candle to came. Every other song sounds the same, he talks about the same thing on every song, he sings almost every hook( a la Ja Rule), there isnt much to this album, but ryder music is a hot song, but if you're a true hip-hop fan, you will feel let down by 50."
4,THE MASSACRE IS CRAZY,Despite what people are saying i listen to all of 50's stuff.This album is crazy but is not as good as get rich or die tryin'. All the songs are catchy and grow on to you very quicklytheres 22 songs and if u listen to um all the hooks stick in ya head honestly 50 could've done better but the album was still off the chain.Haters gone say diffrent but buy it its worth itfor real 50 fans he just aint as much hungry but the music is still crackin.
2,"Got rich , through trying","I knew this album wasnt going to be close to ""Get rich or die Trying"", but damn i almost want to call him gay for this B.S he calls the massacre. people please download,buy it for less than 10$ (bootleg), or whatever you can do to keep from bying this album. Ima save my time to tell u fans how this cd is..................GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Soooo WEAK !!!!!,50 is nothin without production. His first album had probably the best beats on it that an album has had in the past 5 years. This one dont and his lyrics and flow are awful. I would definitely listen before I copped this album. Cause I bought it and I regret it. I agree biggest disappointment of '05.
1,Suxs my soxs,Yea...this is by far some of the worst music (if you can even call it that) I have ever heard. I mean he doesnt even write his own songs ( as I have heard from MANY people). Weve heard it all before you say a couple rhymes and get real big...when are they gonna do something new.
1,50 cent buy this album,Buy this album its has a lot of good songs. He should have colloabrated with Britney Spears cause she is a great lyricist just like 50 cent. 50 cent is the best rapper in the whole world he should get a grammy for this album. He is better then any rapper alive and he is a tough guy Yeah buy this
1,What is this??,"50 cent is not a musician he has no talent along with the rest of the stupid rappers that you are buying cd's of, every cd is the same talking about money ,drugs ,guns ,and mistreatment of women -- if you think these things are so cool I would like to see you engage in these activitys---- it is very sad that those 9 bullets did not kill Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson ... the world would be a much better place"
3,it grew on me,Now im no fan of 50 cent and i think he can't rap at all and if it wasn't for the beats that Dre produces for him and his flow then his music would be complete garbage.This cd at first was garbage for me but after listening to it a lot it is actually an all right LP.Even tho he has absolutely nothing to actually rap about except things that mean nothing like his money and cars about half the songs are catchy and i give the man credit because he sells records and he will be known forever in hip-hop history which is y i had to pick up this cd so i have a piece of hip-hop history.
2,"""the massacre, i hope he meant mascara"" - sheek louch hahah","this cd wasn't that great, definitely wasn't a massacre, all tracks sound alike do to his flow, same thing over n over again, needs to think of sumden different, best song was 'i'm supposed to die tonight' em's n dre's production save this one, i did like most songs to an extent but some was just wack n most lyrics from em sucked but whateva he gon' do what he do n keep gettin rich so good luck to him, the get rich or die tryin' soundtrack is pretty nasty though, he stepped some of his game up on it but it's still the same flow, oh well cd's not bad, i wouldn't recommend it, get that new soundtrack instead"
4,Be Easy,"This album gets hated on way to much, sure it wasn't up the standards of Get Rich, but overal it was a very solid album, with 3 huge singles. Outta Control, Gunz Come Out, My Toy Soldier, Baltimore Love Thing, God Gave Me Style, I'm Supposed To Die Tonight. Fif shows versatility and his hook game is top notch, album bangs from start to finish with only a couple minor road bumps"
1,"Some ""alright"" beats...",Not much else I can say about this CD that hasn't already been said. There are some decent beats on this album and that's why I gave it 1 star. 50 Cent is a bad rapper (and even those that enjoy this album should agree). He has nothing new to offer and the ONLY reason he became such a huge hit is because of the help Eminem & Dr.Dre gave him. I highly recommend that you spend your $ somewhere else. This CD will get old really quick.
2,What others said is true...,"Though this album has 22 songs, only a few (~7 songs) are listenable. All the rest is the song that everybody can compose...Anyway, see what you are going to expect from this album. If an album with a few hits does not disappoint you, go get it, at least you can get Disco Inferno, Candy Shop. These are above average songs. If you want an album full of hits, avoid this one and go get the Game's ""Documentary"". This is far much better."
3,destruction is here,"This album is series, just as good as his 1st one. The only thing wrong wit 50 cent is his mouth. 50 will never be better than nas lyrically,nas is a legend no one can touch the skills of nas (except tupac and b.i.g). on a scale from 1 to 10 i give it a 7...(songs to look forward to are ryder music, ski mask way, and hate it or love it remix). When you hear piggy bank start laughin cause thats a bad move by 50..."
1,I wish I could give No Stars!!!!!!!!!!!!,"LETS B 4real. 50 Cent is a one album wonder. his name is selling this album because it surely isn't the music. I really didn't like his first one. 75% of his new cd sounds like something he has done before, 4 Ex: Disco Inferno sounds just like On Fire by Lloyd Banks or In the Club. Candy Shop Sounds just like Magic Stick By Lil Kim and Him. I really don't understand the hype. he talks about rappers he has no chance at being better than. Get over you self 50 you garbeg!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Deserves negative stars.,"50, I have some incredible advise for you: Shut the hell up. Seriously, this is getting old. By now we understand you're a gangsta pimp with big-bootied ladies and I'm getting tired of turning around and see him shooting at the Beatles' records. Rap is a disgrace, I wouldn't touch it. It used to mean something, I'll admit Run-DMC is okay. But now, it's just pointless."
1,People will eat this up,"The cover is laughable, the song Candy Shop is the worst song ive heard in a long time. This guy raps like a fat man running a mile, it starts off good then decreases slowly. Anyone notice that besides me? I know this cd will be #1 on Billboard and every other magazine, Candy Shop is probably already a #1 song, and it'll break records but why? He can rap but just not on studio produced albums, his mixtapes are way better then Dre or Eminem produced garbage. He should dump those cute little songs and Eminem, sing the way he does on mix tapes, then ill believe he's a ""gangster"", but thats wont happen."
3,OKAY I guess,Lets all just face it. All you people tricking yourselves stop . 50 cent stinks at rapping the music is okay and the beats are great but 50 just is not good. His rhymes are very weak and ... well he isn't very good. Peace.
4,Sweet,"From a producers perspective, I give the producers 4 and a Half mics collectively. 50 could have done better but his overall performance does not over-shadow the great tracks. Like ""Piggy Bank"", undoubtedly Hate it or Love it"" is a classic. The diss is My overall impression is that this album, in all enerst, will grow to top ""Get rich or die tryin'""."
3,Impossible to Match Perfection,"In many ways it's a shame the releases of ""The Massacre"" and ""Get Rich or Die Tryin'"" weren't reversed. If ""The Massacre"" were being judged on its own merits, and it does have some good beats and tight rhymes, it would be considered a good album. Not a great album, but a good one. However, as a follow up to one of the highest selling, most powerful records to come to the American public's attention since the days of ""All Eyez on Me""--""The Massacre"" doesn't live up to its title. After hearing the entire album several times-- I feel a better title might have been ""The Papercut""."
3,Another sophmore jinx album,"This album is ok but I expected along with alot of others that he would have come up with a better album than this. It has a bunch of average songs and average beats. But he just talks about the same thing as the last album, and once again Eminem made him sound like an amatuer rapper from the song that they have together. I dont know why he continues to let Em make him look bad on his own album. Luckily this album was bootleg because I woulda been pretty upset if I had spent $15 on this. The best song on this album by far is ski mask way!!!"
1,rap sucks,"rap is the gayest, most overplayed, retarded style of music on earth. ,listen to metal. thats good stuff its underplayed and underappreciated. rap is for retards. period"
4,an impresive sequal,"Listen 50 is hot he has his own style and it's catchy an good for Hip-Hop. I would reccomend this album to people that love hooks an partyin'i love this sequel. /Candy Shop/ is as good if not better than in da club. /We gotta love thing/is a well told relationship story. Amazin featuring Olivia is impressive and most of all /PIGGY BANK/ Were he dissis' Jadakiss, Shine and Fat Joe its hot so go an cop dat not quite better than THE DOCUMENTARY! cAsPeR"
1,Don't Believe The Hype,I Can't Think Of Anyone Who Actually Bought This Album That's Not A G-Unit Employee......Remember When 50 Was Dope? I Do...Before He Got Shot..He Was Supposed To Come Out With 'Power of The Dollar' Which Didn't Come Out...I Just Listened To It Recently And It's Really Good.G-Unit Killed Hip Hop^^True Story
3,BEST CD EVER! G-G-G-G-G-Unit,"1.Intro 2/10 Straight up corny2.In my hood 5/10 - 50 is not a gangsta3.This is 50 5/10 - *read In my hood*4.I'm suppose to die tonight 8.9/105.Piggy Bank 6/10 ""I'll git atcha, ma knife cut ya skeeeen""6.GatMan and Robin 4/107.Candy Shop 7/10 but just too played out8.Outta Control 6/109.Get in my car 7/10 ""Nah, it was nuffin""10.Ski Mask Way 8/10 ""Is dat watchu bought fo me?""11.Baltimore Love thing 8/1012.Ryder Music 2/1013.Disco Inferno 7/1014.Just a lil bit - 7/1015.Gunz Come out - 8/1016.My toy soldier 4/1017.Position of Power 2/1018.Build You Up((Feat. Ray Charles) 6/1019.God gave me style 7/1020.So amazing 9/1021.I don't need em 1/1022.Hate it or love it remix 8.5/10"
3,You Can Do Better,"It never ceases to amaze me in how all of G-Unit's mixtapes are way better than the albums. I'm dissapointed in how some of the what I and many others thought great songs that were on the mixtapes didn't get on the album. Lyrically 50 is seriously lacking on this one but there are some good punchlines. The beats are pretty good. You can't blame the guy though, it's pretty hard to followup an album like ""Get Rich or Die Tryin"". No more than three stars, no less than two and a half."
3,50 CENT IS ALL YOU SHOULD PAY FOR THIS ALBUM,"I really am a 50 cent fan, but this album just didnt live up to the hype. Its got some catchy tunes but the lyrical content is whack and repeated in a majority of the songs. This album really doesn't have standing power, most of the songs will play out in about a week or two. What really kills me is the beef with jada, fat joe, shyne, and nas(kelis too). What the heck is he thinking? Hes trying to build his rep on controversy not hot songs. Candy shop anyone? depends on your taste. Piggy Bank? sounds like a muppet babies title. Disco Inferno? so so....He better deliver next time and stop with the beef, because what will he do, when he runs out of cats to beef with? 50 STEP YOUR GAME UP or like Jay-Z said ONE HOT ALBUM EVERY TEN YEAR AVERAGE................ THE GAMES ALBUM IS A MUCH BETTER."
1,Bryce's Massacre,If 50 Cent is rap's MVPThen why the hell can't he make a good cd?The lyrics are weakAnd the beats don't hitDon't buy this trashBecause it's simply $hit.-Bryce
1,....,"This whole ""I'm such a big pimp with a bunch of girls as skinny as sticks effing me but you should feel kinda bad for me because I really had a bad life"" thing is getting annoying. Fast. 50 Cent is like all other rappers, always showing off his riches."
1,WEAK,"I was going to make sure and post a comment on how bad this disk was, but apparently everybody can tell. This is a weak disk, it is the same thing over and over. The first one showed hints of it but was his first release so it made up for it. This got rid of the doubt. 50 aint nothin'. Give me the Game any day, and once Detox drops its gonna be 50 who."
1,The Massacre....The Mess is more like it,"I listened to the snippets to this and I wish I could get my 2 mins back. All I have to say is no talent+no lyrical content+ lots of hype= A hot ass mess at its finest. I bet the millions he sold are in Dre, Eminem, and Lloyd Banks' garages, basements, coaster holders, and used as toilet paper b/c its like he wiped his ass after a good doo-doo and said, ""Here's the Massacre! Voila!"" Signed Starbrite Sunshine Jones..................SHOOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,DON'T SUPPORT THIS CLOWN,"50 Cent, the biggest idiot and phony in hip-hop, recently released an album called ""The Massacre"". This is straight up garbage. He is way too lazy on this album, has flow reminiscent of Nelly, and is weak. In ""Get Rich Or Die Tryin'"", he came out hard, hungry for respect. He is lazy and puts in no effort into this waste. There are NO standout tracks, instead I'll say the WORST tracks: Candy Shop, Piggy Bank, Disco Inferno, God Gave Me Style. Hell to G-Unit, Hell to 50 Cent."
2,50 blows,"Garbage. this album is an insult to hip-hop. if your looking for another ""Get Rich or Die Trying"" you will be sadly disappointed. Any ""talent"" he had is right out the window, no originality, no depth, no metaphors, no punchlines and to top it all off the production is played. Please save your money, cop some Tupac or Nas, leave fifty's sh*t on the shelf, any tru hip hopper knows the real sh*t, this aint it."
3,Pretty Good CD,"I'll admit that there are some weak songs on this album but overall it was pretty good. He should have came a little harder like he did on ""Get Rich or Dye Tryin'"", but this is decent enough for now. Maybe his 3rd CD will be on a higher level. Hopefully."
1,Hate It or Hate It,"I really can't believe Dre or Eminem let this garbage get released under their labels. 50 Cent I understand, he doesn't know any better. 50 was whining so much about Dre working on Game's album instead of his that he got impatient and got wack producers. ""I'm Supposed to Die Tonight"" is the only thing I can listen to on the whole album. Go somewhere and listen to the snippets, 30 seconds is all you need to realize how horrible this is. And that beef with Game was all an attempt to start controversy and sell albums. 50 committed lyrical suicide with this one, I hope he doesn't wake up this time."
4,what are you kidding me?,"I see reviews on her saying ""all he talks about is drugs and guns"" it's 50 Cent, this isn't ""The sounds of music."" All in all the album is alright, not great but alright. Lacking from Get Rich but still solid compared to what's out there today, MTV IS GARBAGE, SO IS BET. Yes 50 does make certain threats on purpose it helps him sell his albums."
1,Oh no!,"I'm sure this will sell millions of CDs but that still doesn't make it good. I'm sure radio will play it into the ground while other, more talented artists are ignored.What a shame."
1,This is HIP POP not HIP HOP!,"Proof that a couple of Quarters can't buy you skillz, but if you get enough radio play, shallow people will pay your billz! Just another weak, highly publicized, highly commercialized, rap record disguised as hip hop. These songs brainwash us daily over the radio with repetition. If you don't know what hip hop really is or stands for, by all means enjoy this!"
2,Umm.. It grew on Me and still not Good enough,"I was highly anticipating this album. I was hurt to say to my brother, that this was no good. When I heard it the first time, i was ready to give it a 1 star. The singles were annoying and some of the songs had to grow on me. Lil Bit should have been a single and some other songs are really good, but not enough. Many of the songs that deserves to be skipped in your CD player. Really disappointed, hopefully he can bounce back before these other kats in ""Piggy Bank"" eat him up. The Game is sick though, go cop The Documentary if you dont have it yet"
1,WORST LYRICS I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!!!,"What the hell happened to 50? Get Rich or die tryin was a great album but this one just plain sucks. i thought maybe he would show a little maturity on this album and talk about something other than getting shot, women, and rims. this is not real hip hop at all this is just commercial garbage.Have you heard those beats? how can you say that is real hip-hop? oh and by the way piggybank is the worst diss song i have ever heard. 50 i don't think its wise to diss some of hip hops elite especially nas. didn't u see what he did to jay-z? nas is a hip hop legend and is lyrically tons better than u and will rip u to shreds (just like he did to jay-z). this can't be the work of dr. dre because he knows what real hip-hop is. you can see game got a lot more advice from him which is why his album is 10 times better."
1,One star because zero was not an option!!!,"Okay, for a million dollars...what's talentless, delusional and been shot nine times...50 cent. He should be shot nine more times for this ridiculous attempt at music. This moron can't hold a candle to The Game...who killed him with ""300 Bars"". He takes shots at Fat Joe, the Game, Shyne and Samuel L. Jackson. Then he makes the ultimate wankster move by taking credit for Kanye West's success. He must be smoking crack. Do yourself a favor, bypass this CD unless you actually like garbage."
1,Just horrendus,"To wack beats, to weak disses, to second-grade lyrics...50 CENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Highly unrecommended."
3,Ugh,"This album gets on my nerves. His first album was alot better. I'm sure alot of people will agree. I really don't like rap that much. The only rap/hip-hop I like is by tupac, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, The Notorious B.I.G. and Kanye West. I think 50 could've done a lil better on this."
1,Not the one,"50 is trying to diss Nas (the lyrical God)? Please, thats like Bart Simpson fighting the Incredible Hulk! 50 cent is a maggot!"
1,Those bullets may have affected his brain!,"Those shots he took might have messed with his head. 50 wants to diss Nas? Nas has 4 classic albums (learn about it) and Nas already destroyed Pac and Jay Z. 50 cent is nothing but a vermin, scumbag, worth less than dirt.50 is a maggot!"
1,Moron.,This is mindless trash. Anyone who gives this thing more than one star is the laughing stock of my life. How many times can you idiots listen to this fool talk about the same nonsense over and over again?Is it sinking in yet? HELLO?! KNOCK KNOCK!! Wake up and start supporting talented musicians and kick this piece of trash back to the gutter where he belongs.Thank God I'm not a teenager anymore. I'd have to kill myself if I had to put up with my peers listeninig to this garbage every day. I feel bad for all those kids out there who appreciate TALENT and are constantly having this tool's music shoved down their throats on a daily basis. Truly.
1,50 cents garbage,"50 cent is the most garbage rapper ever period, he has no poetic jesture, no lyrical content. after destroying ja rules career he comes out wif songs like lil bit and candy shop is real sad. i dont noe why 50 cent even went at nas. hes not even on his, level nas will kill him just like he killed jayz. if you really listen to rap and ur not no fake p*ssy u would not buy this garabge album. not one song in this album is classic it has a couple of catchy songs. 2pac is the best rapper to pick up the mic, a legend in his own rhymes. buy his album and dont even consider this trash album trust me."
1,Whaaack,THIS CD IS THA WHACKEST CD I HAVE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE.DO NOT BUY THIS CD.NONE OF THE SONGS ARE EVEN WORTH LISTENING TO
1,Terrible,How did he go from Power Of The Dollar & Get Rich Or Die tryin to this?!?!He got rich and stopped tryin'this album is TERRIBLE
2,He's crazy,"I just can't get past the fact that he has the balls to diss Nas. The cd isn't bad and i respectED him for changing up his tone and flow but damn! He lost every ounce of respect i HAD for him by even reciting the name, 'Nas.' Nas is on the top 5 list of the greatest rappers and 50 isn't even on the top 10. This is rediculous. 50 just lost a devoted fan. Dis ja rule. Dis fatty. Dis jada. he can even diss his main man, emishmem. but to touch nas is cruelty to the industry. i just hope and pray that Nas retaliates and comes out with Ether Part II. not a bad cd. but i can't fathom what is goin on in his big ass head. maybe hes got a little lead still stuck up in his grill."
1,it comes down to 1 thing: pure joke.,"After Get Rich or Die Tryin I was expecting something really good from this fool but I was disapointed big time. The first time I even heard the cd be played I was at the homies house and he started playing it and he danced his ass off to it.. i was like ""what the hell is wrong with you? this aint 50 cent!"" i really was hoping it wasnt but it was. and thank God i didnt pay for the cd. even tho i hated the first song i heard i still wanted to at least give it a chance.. so i just allowed it to play through all the way in my car.. lyrics are just horrible. there are a few decent songs.. i guess.. for this album it will take some time for me to kinda ""adapt"" to it. i dont recommend buying it thats for sure, burn it or sumthin, plz dont waste ur money on it. If you want somethin tight then get The Game, i bang that everyday."
1,Godawful piece of crap.,"I wrote this song for the 50 man.I'll hit you with the retard carI'l see how so far you areI'll have you quitting all hip-hopKeep quitting 'til you hit the spot (woah)You can have it your way, how crappy you do itYou gon' back that thing up or should i push up on itTemperature lowing, okay lets laugh at youDance floor jam empty, cold as iceI'll break it down for you now, 50 it's hardIf you be a moron, haha to badIn the hotel or in the back of the rentalOn the beach or in the park, it's no wonder nobody loves youGot the crappy stick, I'm the dreck doctorHave your friends teasin you 'bout how sprung I gotchaI don't want you to show me how you work it 50Get on top then get to bouncing round like a chicken writerI'm a 50 hater when it come to this s**tAfter you work up a sweat you can't play with my stickI'm tryin to explain 50 the best way I canI'll hate you forever, even if I can'tan(ha ha).See how better I am at rapping than 50 cent?"
1,this cd is garbage,i dont know what is wrong with kids these days. look im a college professor and i teach poetry. rap basically is poetry and i love rap. but come on. im going to say this to everybody they do have to admit. 50 is no true rapper. first of all he made fun of ja rule for singing in his songs.in this album he does the same thing in some of his songs. so what if he got shot 20 times or whatever. i got stabbed by one of my students. he has the worst voice. he cant write any poetry. he is a middle school dropout. 2pac is a good example he actually studied in school and tried hard. i dont get u kids anymore. ive had it.em is not a good example but u can see that he tried hard to get where he is. i have to admit he can be catchy but that does not mean anything. rap is words people. not beat. words. and im black so trust me im right.
1,Horrible,i dunt kno wut 50 is doin he comes out with this album that is suppose to be better than get rich or die tryin and defitinley isnt its horrible then he kicks the game out of g-unit its just all horrible
2,It's whack but the beats are nice,"i expected this cd to not be as nice as any of the other stuff 50's put out, but idk this cd was exceptionally whack...just way too long and everything on it was filler...a few stand out tracks, but nothing to spend 15 bills on. but what's sad is this is gonna go about 5x platinum and some cats are gonna still say it was the best release of 2005"
3,AWW MAN DAMN,"Awwwww man Damn i just wasted $18 bucks. money i should have spent on white tees damnnnnnnn there are only 5 good songs on the album. A lil bit, Candy shop, disco inferno, In my hood, Gatman and Robbin pheeeww Eminem saved that one. 50 sounds like he didnt take this project serious, he probably thought he could make a classic because of his status. You can tell he made the decisions of the album making on his own. He definately needed a lot more guidance from Dr.Dre like THE GAMES album had, i mean it is only his second album. He is definately a victim of the sophmore jinx. THE GAMES ALBUM IS DEFINATELY BETTER. But I definitely will keep the cd in my player though just because of those 5 songs. Cant wait till Jadakiss airs his ass out neither."
3,It started out okay!!,"Everyone just admit it, if your into rap, then you must love mr. 50 cent. The first time I heard a few of these songs off of his CD, including candyshop, just a lil bit, and hate it or love it, I loved all of them, and so would you...if you have never heard them before! But still to this day they are STILL playing those songs that get overplayed. If I lived in Japan or something and lived in a part of town where this kinda music wasn't played I would love it. But listening to it over and over again gets old, much as this CD does...STOP PLAYING THE OLD AND GET WITH THE NEW!! If you want fresh crisp music you might not want to look here, just turn on the radio because each song plays 50 times a day anyway."
1,They Need To Sell This In A Candy Shop.,"The first album was so hot that he couldn't back it up wit another. This album was so garbage that when I first bought it, I gave it away to a junky the same day. The production was wack, lyrics was pittyful, and the hooks were messed up. He only has three songs worth listening to. Thats Bad! And he has the nerves to diss the The Game. Don't be mad because he hot and you not. Stop cryin like Ja Rule and make good music. Who you gon dog next Banks & Buck. Slow Ya Roll buddy & rethink ya whole future. Ya feel me. Its Beezly folk!"
4,It's Just A Lil Infectious,"When this album first came out, I didn't really care for it outside of a few tracks. But, upon a second listen a few months later due in fact that ""Just a Lil Bit"" is becoming the jam of the summer, I discovered this a hot album. The radio singles ""Candy Shop"" ""Just a Lil Bit"" and ""Disco Inferno"" do exatcly what they are intended to do, be hot club bangers, and they might be the hottest club songs of the year. The street stuff is very good too like ""This is 50"", ""Gunz Come out"" and ""Ski Mask Way"". These tracks are hard, but not too hard that casual hip hop fans wouldn't listen to them. 50 has made an album in true chameleon fashion, that it pleases virtually every facet of hip hop."
1,This Cd should be massacred,"Look at these pathetic 4 to 5 star reviewers, this is a truly dreadful, absolutely idiotic album with 50 doing the same thing that many other rappers have been doing for years, dissing rappers, making pop songs, doing the same old idiotic shtickand what's more 5-0 says he's gonna be rap's king of NY?, King of NY?, Please, this guy is a poser and disgrace to NY (Even though I'm not from NY) and the hip hop community and the music industry in general.Yea 5-0 sells alright, that's because people are stupid for buying this mess.50 has never been talented, not in Power of a Dollar, GRODT (Although they were some good beats) and certainly not this oneThis is absolutely one of the year's worst albums and I Hope that this rapper and his truly dreadful gimmick group (G-Unot) will be on vh1's where are they now in a few years.You 5-0 and G-Unot stans are annoying.Can't wait for Nasdaq Jones to expose the real side of 50 and his stupid group.Music Rating: Zero Stars."
2,Extremely Overrated,"The only reason that this CD deserves any stars, is the fact that it has a few decent beats. On the other hand, this CD is not even half as good as his first CD which was still a heap of garbage. Now he has ""blessed"" us with his life story and a movie to top it. Its too bad that Tupac never got the opportunities that 50 Cent has received. Rap music died with Tupac and it needs someone to revive it. 50 Cent is not the answer to the dying rap music scene. However, he seems to think that he is. I listened to his unreleased CD called ""The Power of the Dollar"" which was never released due to bootlegging. That CD was actually really good. However, the fame got to him. 50 Cent can't sell a CD without standing on the front with his shirt off. If sex really does sell, than that may be the only thing that 50 Cent has going for him because his lyrics aren't going to sell his music. God help us all."
1,"this album was a massacre, to my ears...","this album proves that mainstream culture has a low iq supporting garbage like this, i don't need to get into detail why this album is awful, it really does speak for itself. if you want to listen a good rap album check out the new Common CD, thank you."
2,Some of the greats,"Wow im amazed some of you havent mentioned some of the other rappers who helped the whole rap concept and made it mainstream..MC8, Easy E, Sir mix alot..(Kinda)..Erase E, Boss Ballin, Too short, DJ Quik, Outkast,salt n pepa, JJ Fad and many more helped paved a way for new artist to create and recreate in some cases these artists masterpieces into something new. Then comes along some crap hole like 50 cent whos awesome marketing team thought up a way to promote him quickly to destroy everything artitst had worked to accomplish..Every song or album 50 cent produces is another brick fallin from that empire that we call rap..Every building has its breaking point..you take away to many bricks it falls..same with rap you take away all the talent and VOILA its gone. Im dissapointed with rap to date..I would rather listen to country and them talkin about how they wanna ""Hump a horse..kill a cowboy"" or something like that. Anyway just my 2 cents."
2,"OK, but not the best...","Andre Previn is definetely a noteworthy conductor, however he can't match the Tchaikovsky insight that Antal Dorati has. This recording seems to lengthen the ballet even more than the almost 3 hours it already is. If you are looking for Sleeping Beauty in a dynamic, clear recoding with 2 jam-packed CD's for the price of one, I suggested looking for Sleeping Beauty as conducted by Antal Dorati and remastered by RCA. Dorati's stressed stings, and gutty attack on the music bring out the beauty of the Russian-ness of the ballet. Don't miss out on a deal like that just because you know the name Previn."
4,As good as the originals,As good as the originals. Used this item on my John Deere mower deck and have had no problems. The installation is easy. The item is reliable and wears reasonably.
4,Off to a good start.,"Ok, at first I was curious to see how this book would read, but I have to admit, you did a good job. It's easy to tell that you spent some time working on the characters, and how they would interact with each other without loosing the story line. You did a pretty good jot with this one. In your next book, I'd like to see how you handle sequels. Keep it up, you're off to a really good start."
2,The Red House is so-so,"While the quality of the Blu-ray is just as good as would be expected and adds new life to a black and white 1947 flick, the film itself is a bit lackluster. The plot is highly predictable and the scare factor didn't live up to what I expected based on other reviews. After looking up the ""whatever-happened to"" details of the careers of the two young lead actors in the film, Lon McCallister and Allene Roberts, I was not surprised that their acting careers produced little beyond this film. However, much on the positive side, I was reminded of the outstanding acting ability of Edward G. Robinson who redeemed a pedstrian role with the same intensity he poured into his other, more memorable ones. Robinson was a consummate actor who deserved more honor than he received in his career. If you are into B movies of the 1940's, you will probably find this one enjoyable but not likely a favorite. If you are interested in Robinson's work, skip this one and see Double Indemnity instead."
2,"EXPECT TO GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, AND NOTHING MORE.","The scissor is very stiff, because the blades rub against each other. Which makes it a little difficult to use. But what can you expect for $3? The best thing that I can say for it. Is that it is better than nothing. I am spending more to get a decent replacement."
1,Writing was painful...,"This book really had a terrific plot basis, the general concept would have been really interesting, the only problem was that the writing was really terrible, the plot, characters and descriptions weren't fully fleshed out or developed and the whole thing fell flat."
1,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!,"I bought this game for my 8 year old daughter at her request. She loves the gameshow on TV and has been asking for this game for a few months. She was so excited to get it!She played it three times and discovered that the $1,000,000 is always hidden behind Case #24 and hasn't played it since....who would? What is the fun in that?I had read reviews on this game before I got it for her and although other reviews reflected this same problem, it appeared that they had older versions and that the bug was fixed. How can something like this still be on the market?With over 850 other games available for the DS, buy any one of those but certainly not this one."
5,I'm a fan...,"I watched this Dvd when I was in England. Is one of the best ones he did, the band was great and the show wonderful. Just buy it. Was history..."
2,Fantastic show and music!,"This video is just fantastic; the music is great, and the show has a drive and atmosphere that is just breathtaking! Buy it and enjoy it!"
4,Interesting.,"If you are looking for a book that speaks of history,family problems,hope, dark secrets, as well as mouth watering recipes to try at the end of the chapters, then this book is for you. Camille Broussard works as a cook for the priests of her parish, but from time to time makes up meat pies and cooks up sauce recipes to sell from time to time. When her son in law(who is also a distant cousin)dies, and leaves her a fortune, which the wife(and Camille's daughter felt should have went to her instead),Camille eventually takes the money and opens a restaurant in the Watts area that initially takes off and sputters. Her family is at war with it, but in the end, love conquers all. interesting story."
3,Not That Impressive,"I was very diasppointed with this CD. The songs are not all the spectacular. My friend, a die hard Nsync fan, even hated their song on this CD. The only song on here that I recommend is ""Last Christmas"" sung by Darren Hayes. He did a great job on this song, and I am constantly putting just this song on repeat in my CD player."
1,Who told Rosie O' Fat she could sing?,"Who in their right mind told her she could sing? All she can do is tell dirty jokes and talk a lot - A LOT!!Thank goodness it is a CD and not a DVD! That way, I don't have to look at her......"
1,Terrible,"I am sorry, but after hearing this CD at a friends house I can't see why anyone would want it. Rosie should stick to her talk show, cause she can't sing. There are so many good Christmas CD's i can't see why anyone would buy this even if it is for charity."
5,Fun for every one to listen to and enjoy,"I don't like christmas to start the first of Nov. but I couldn't wait to listen to Rosie,s cd I really think that I will be able to listen to this one year around. Thank you Rosie for all the good work you do, and for making me aware that I don't have to be a big money maker to be a happy person. As long as Im happy with what I do and have the love of My children and husband Im a Success."
5,Electric Football,This is a great game. It's a chess game on wheels with some luck throw into the activity. My kids are interacting together. This game is something they can do as a family. It's a very sturdy well made game.
2,Does not work right,"Everytime I buy this game I am sadly disapointed.1. The game is very noisy2. The clock does not work properly. Sometimes it even goes backwards.3. The quarterback is hard to operate. It is hard to pass or kick the ball properly. I have lost so many of those footballs using that thing. I ended up not using it and just go for touchdowns and just run the ball.4. The players do not go where you want them to, especially if the feelers are bent.5. It takes five to ten minutes to set up a play that last only ten seconds.6. It is expensive to buy extra teams in both home and away jerseys.7. The player pieces break easily, plus if the game board is bent it does not operate properly.In all this game is nothing but a waste of money. I prefer the computer or video football games over this game."
4,A very nice book,"We bought several books for my two-year old son to prepare him for our new baby. This book does a nice job talking about transitions, specifically growing up and needing a new, larger bed. My son identifies with that, and he likes the story (especially how Papa Bear uses tools to build the new bed). The new baby shows up at the very end of this story, so admittedly, that is not the main focus of this book. (The book might be better titled, ""The Berenstain Bears' New Bed"".) If you want a book that gives your child details on a new baby (what happens at the hospital, how to breastfeed, how to help take care of it, etc.), then you obviously need to buy a different book. But you probably want to get multiple books on the 'new baby' theme, and this one fits in nicely."
3,I wasn't clear on what age this was for - too old for my 2 yo,"I bought this for my two year-old and the story is a little old for him. We read it to him anyway, but couching the new baby in terms of a new bed being built out in the woods with his father is a bit obscure to try and prepare him for his new sibling. It's just another nice story to read instead."
4,This book is good for small children.,"This is book is good for small children, who need to understand how a new baby will change their life without being saddled with details on labor, delivery and pregnancy. To those who expect more, get another book... this one was written in the early 80s, when such things were as openly discussed as they are now. Most fathers didnt go into the delivery room at the time. Besides, they're BEARS not people. Also, to the people who find the gender-role things askew, come on... again, this was not written in this decade... yes it is dated, but I personally don't WANT my kids reading a whole lot of details on the process. Last, some complain that the child would have to be stupid to not notice mama's changing shape... not necessarily. A very small child would only notice such a thing when it effects them (hence mama's lap getting too small)."
2,"Well made, but not warm enough!","Glove is well made, but it does not get warm enough to do any good. Even at temperature in the upper 30's hands still get cold after 10 minutes. May be better off investing in the 12 volt type."
5,Must Read for History Buffs!,"This has to be one of my favorite books. The content of the book, historicaly, is amazing. Gilbert Morris must have gone to a lot of trouble to research his book so thoroughly. The trials that Gilbert Winslow experiences are facinating to any reader. The story line of Gilbert and Humility is truly romantic and gives you hope that true love does exist. Gilbert Winslow was a real man that traveled on the Mayflower as well as Humility Cooper and several other characters. However, I do believe that Gilbert went back to England after coming to the New World as well as Humility Cooper. I do not know if the story line between them is a true one, but I don't want to know; I fell in love with them and that is the way I'd like to keep it!"
5,Superb,"If you are going to purchase this collection, you've probably heard them before and want to own them. I can listen to them again and again, but admittedly this kind of classical is not for everyone.I'm not an expert on the variations and renditions of the cello suites, like some of these reviewers, but i can say that i am very familiar and a regular listener of classical music, and i find them very beautiful to listen to. The quality of recording is very high, so it you have a high end sound system, you may take great delight in listening to the suites again and again.Worth the $$."
3,One hit wonder,"""Apostrophe(')"" is outstanding but the rest of the album is at best average. For accessible but outstanding work of this kind, I recommend ""Sheik Yerbouti."""
3,Not one of the best nor one of the worst,"This cd is a great tention releaver. It's funny in the way many people can understand. There's not suttle humor as in Lumpy gravy and no pressing ishues. Musically it's more polished and not all that hard to follow. Oh, it's good music but when contrasted against works like Shut up and play yer Guitar or some of his clasical works it falls down. I like the cd but feel that it's not one of the best at all. Now I'll get crusified for destroying the perfect 5 star rating. sorry but I'll keep listening to it like it buut think it's average."
5,essential zappa,Looking to round out your eclectic collection? Want one of the most underrated guitarists? Fun lyrics? This is a must.
3,Some good stuff,"It's hard to rate self-help books, in my opinion. On the one hand, if someone can take a bit of advice and use it then it must be worth it. On the other hand, most of the advice is usually common sense, just repackaged info you've heard before, and/or full of fluff.This book is a real quick read. I do like the author's definition of confidence which basically is ""To be true to yourself and take action where/when you feel it needs to be taken, and don't be afraid to look bad.""She then goes into three areas of confidence; behavior, emotional, and spiritual. She states that spiritual confidence is perhaps the most important because you have to have a belief that things are going to work out for you in the long run. I thought this particular idea was basically fluff and can be summed up into one word, optimism.Self-help books are not miracle pills, they are like private pep talks. The first 2/3 of this book got me invigorated to go out and live life with more confidence!"
2,Love the show but...,Picture is blurry. Not as clear as it should be. Maybe cause its the first season?!?!Love the show tho.
1,"The same story with other faces, other jobs","The repetitive story of american TV is exasperating.Why not make a drama with some depth, instead of the same likable people, that are good looking, have a good life... That is dramatic at times, funny at times, and incredibly silly and empty most of the time? This is the sorry excuse to invade us with stupidest ads, who are the real drivers here. the same hit show, over and over and over again.C'mon.LA Law happened. Long. Many. Similar. Mediocre Copies. Ago."
5,1st time to watch this show,"I love this show!!! Each episode is like a little movie, and the acting is superb. Since I'm hearing-impaired, I can replay whatever I have missed, and it works out really well. Can't wait for the second season to some out on dvd!"
5,Great CD for little pirates!,"My son (age 4) loves pirates so of course when he saw this at our local library, he had to bring it home to listen to. He loved it so much, that he would listen to it alone each day while playing pirates in his room. So when it came time to return the library copy, we bought him his own. He now listens to the manatee song every night as he goes to sleep. As a bonus, he now has learned a lot about manatees since he wanted to know more about them!"
4,A Christmas Story for Kids.,"MY FIRST STORY OF CHRISTMAS is a book geared towards younger children that tells the story of Jesus' birth. The book is written in a very simple and straitforward manner. Other than the usual vocabulary associated with Christmas (manger, shepherds, etc.) the words aren't difficult and should be understood by most children. Also, unlike many Christmas stories that have the shepherds and wise men arriving at the same time to the stable where Jesus was born, this story is more Biblically accurate as it illustrates the wise men arriving to see and worship Jesus several years after He was born. Roger Langton's illustrations that accompany the text are smooth, warm, and comforting; appealing the children's need for security. My only criticism about the book is that until the last page there is no mention why Jesus' birth was necessary; why it was so special. Other than that, this is a wonderful book telling the story of Christmas for young children."
1,Alcott's books deserve proper editions!,"I've long been a fan of the lesser Louisa May Alcott books and now my daughter has discovered them too. I was pleased to find Jack and Jill available in this handy paperback by an on-demand publisher. My seventh-grade daughter pounced on the book first, in great excitement. It was a bit deflating that there was no book-specific cover art or back cover material--it is a standard, rather ugly cover and the back text advertises the publisher itself. But I guess there's no arguing with that part. Far worse, my daughter found a minefield of typos in the first few pages, which proved very distracting. Then she found that about 1 1/2 pages from 3-4 were repeated verbatim on pages 5-6. She showed me both problems and she was absolutely right: the printing process had gone completely haywire. There was no reason to expect these issues were confined to the first few pages, and we had lost faith in the whole edition. Regretfully, we have sent the book back."
5,I was floored.,"The clarity is so clear. I thought there would be something wrong with the picture, but there was no vertical rolling, no color bleeding, and no dark spots. The colors were soooo vivid, I thought I was watching the actual show. Of course in a recorder material, the picture quality was worse than that of seeing it right infront of you. There was only like a 0.000001% quality degrading. You won't even recognize it. It is like HDTV."
5,Great Quality,I Recommend this tape to anyone who needs video tape. Great sound and quality and value for the money.
3,~Wrong Tapes~,"I wanted to try these Video Tapes for a long time so finally I decided to spend all that money and ordered them and what do I get? ...TDK Ultimate Quality, light Blue and Green Box with a Yellow and Orange Color Stipe across...Wrong Item! Amazon also sell those Tapes for a lot less. When contacted the Seller this is what they said...""HURRICANE SANDY WIPE US OUT, PICKING UP THE PIECES SOMEWHERE ELSE, CAN YOU HOLD YOUR ORDER""What do you say to That? I told the Seller,...I feel very sorry and had no idea and to forget about the order! ...Since I never was able to try the Highly Rated Video Tapes, the ones they send me are just OK! ..Thank You"
2,ORIGINAL IS STILL THE BEST,"yeah, yeah, yeah we know this is the big Hollywood version..but you have to see the original Playhouse 90 version, with Cliff Robertson and Piper Laurie!! its available on VHS (I have it) and 10 times better than this retread....Piper Laurie was incredible...CLiff Robertson says that when he lost the film version to Lemmon, Lemmon said ""I didn't think you'd be able to play comedy""...to which Robertson replied; ""I didn't think 'Days of Wine & Roses' was a comedy""..it's all there in the supplemental material on the VHS....see it instead of this version!!"
