5,Now this is a tent!,"I love it! For years all I've used are these crummy coleman tents that you crawl in and out of. This thing is sturdy, has great features, plenty of room to throw your stuff in and big enough for all three of us to walk around in. This is more like it. With the rainfly on, it doesn't get stuffy inside. I'm going to try out their screen room."
4,I think this CD had a lot of good songs.........,"This Cd had a lot of good songs, every somg should be a hit, and they should all be a number one song........."
1,NOT EVEN 1 STAR!,THEY DESERVE 0 STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NSYNC ARE JUST BACKSTREET BOYS WANNABES! THATS ALL I HAVE TO SAY!
5,NO BSB WANNABES!!!!!,"Sorry to say but... 'N SYNC is giving BSB the boot! =o) The album is great! 'N SYNC's not out here to try and be some other group (BSB). They're just doin' their own thang! 'N SYNC doesn't sound like BSB either. They have their own style! I just love the album and I can't go by a day without listening to it... JC's voice just melts my heart! It's good to still see Justin and JC since MMC has stop airing. They are so wonderful. Much love, respect, happiness, and success to 'N SYNC! Keep it real y'all and stay sweet always ('N SYNC). To all the 'N SYNC fans... Stay 'N SYNC!!! 'N SYNC's #1! I'm an 'N SYNC freak 24/7! GYEA. JC FANatic till I die! =o)"
5,AWESOME!!,A very good group with great songs that have a warm and sincere message. Look forward to future albums and wish them luck!
2,Recipe for success,"Here's a recipe on how to make money.1. Take 5 young guys...preferably with some looks, and a passable singing voice. No knowledge of music or instruments or songwriting is necessary.2. Teach them a few dance steps.3. Teach them the words to some manufactured songs.4. Record a cd and blast the music on any old radio station, television, malls, anywhere where teens hang out.5. Put out a lot of 'souvenirs'. T-Shirts, mugs, posters...anything to get them recognition.6. Now you are ready to put on a concert. Just watch out for the stampeding screaming teenage girls.7. Watch the money roll in. Guaranteed #1 album, Grammy nomination and instant superstar status. Hey, anyone can do it. It don't take much talent. Even most of the music is made by machines.8. Just be forewarned that this type of music won't last forever, so strike while the iron is hot. If you wait too long the craze will be over and you'll be left holding a cold fish."
3,All Right,"It was all right. I would reccomend TLC or DMX instead.But still, I LOVE YOU, JUSTIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Ok, better than Backstreet Boys, but still clones","They're just another ripoff of real bands. Thier lyrics come from giants like Depeche Mode, and thier style of music from New Kids on the Block. They have a better mixer, so thier beat sounds better, and they have the courage to try a few things that aren't ripped off, so they get 2 stars. But they still aren't a real band. Don't buy this CD."
1,"They suck, but they sure can reel in the teenies!","This is sickening commercial pop crap. The lyrics have no meaning, they were brought together by the NKOTB guy, the 'music' comes completely from sequencers, and fancy production is there to keep the voices from sounding completely awful. The selling point for N Sync and every other boy group is that, to quote you teenies 'they are soooo hot!'. The boy group trend has already had its 15 minute resurgence, so now it's time to move on to something which actually requires talent to produce."
1,Clones of the Backstreet Boys,"Hmmm...five white guys, singing dance pop music, girls screaming everywhere...sound familiar? That's because it is. 'N Sync is just a Backstreet Boys clone, obviously seeing the fame and attention that they received. Problem is, 'N Sync lacks any talent what so ever, especially vocal talent. Their lyrics fall dead short of being flat, and the musical beats are ill placed with the music in which they are singing. This is just poison for the ears."
5,Lance is soooooooo HOT!,"You definitaly have to get this CD! It is like the only CD I listen to, except for their Christmas Album which is also the best! *N Sync sings great, and they are SOOOOOOO hot!"
4,~*Get This*~,If you are a true N Sync fan (like me) you definatly need this cd. It may have all the songs you've already seen but The Remixed songs and the live version of Sailing are the best!
4,N Sync luv!,"What can I say? N Sync is an establishing group. There are a lot of boy bands out toda, but they still know how to work it. I got this cd the day it came out. I really want the next one as well. I love the song ""Bye Bye Bye"". It reminds me of my relationship with some of my ex's. Great going N'Sync."
5,First Album Ever!!,"I was 15 when I got this CD and I was happy to get it. I love this whole thing, I have more then one favorite song. I can sing to it, dance to it and feel good. This CD is... I Love It!!"
5,So Great!,"I love this CD! I've wanted a copy since I was ten years old (now 21). My Dad wouldn't let me have it because ""Tearin' Up My Heart"" has the word ""lovers"" in it. This is a must have for anyone who loves *Nsync or Justin Timberlake because this is where it all began. The nineties sound really took me back to my childhood and I absolutely love the cleaner lyrics in comparison to a lot of today's music. The fast paced tracks like ""Here We Go"" and ""Crazy for You"" are good iPod fillers for pumping you up on a workout. Plus there's the classics ""Tearin Up My Heart"" and ""I Want You Back"". You should definitely get this CD!"
5,I Drive Myself crazy waiting for their next cd!!!!!!,"This cd is one of favorites!!!! It has fast beats and slow jams!!! I haven't stoped listening to this cd, it's my favorite next to my Backstreet Boys cd. If you don't have this cd get it!"
5,Great CD. These guys can sing and dance.,These guys are loaded with talent and appear to be decent on top of that. Whats the matter ndsux@hotmail.com......do I detect a note of jealousy ??
5,It's head over heels worth it,This music is great. They have the talent and what it takes to go far! You've got to get it. It's worth it!!!
4,It was good but a little mellow.,I thought it was pretty good but not what I expectid. Like I thought it was going to be like the Backstreet Boys but it was more mellow. One way to make it better I think would to be more upbeat.
5,Justin is the hottest guy on the face of the earth.,"I LOVE JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE. HE IS THE HOTTEST GUY EVER. HE IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE. The CD is good. JUSTIN SOUNDS DISTINCT, AND HIS VOICE IS FABULOUS. I LOVE JUSTIN RANDALL ""CURLY"" TIMBERLAKE MORE THAN ANYTHING ON THE ENTIRE GALAXY."
5,It's the best CD I've ever listened to!!!,"It has tons of great songs, many of which make you want to get up and dance! They are the best singers and the way they sing their songs makes all the songs sound great!!!"
1,Please save us from mindless drivel,"It is a travesty that I have to give this group at least one star. I can't believe that people say this group is sincere. I heard that they have the same canned lyrics compliments of the same people who write for bsb. Also, their songs all run together, if you hear one, don't bother with the rest. I wish they would kick these non-creative, untalented boys off the radio already."
5,Good,"Even though the music is copied from Backstreet Boys, I love this C-D. It has all types of music. If you like the Backstreet Boys, you will like N'Sync."
1,NO TALENT WHATSOEVER! :(,"I'm sorry to say this, but N'sync has no talent whatsoever! I mean what is so good about them? Their looks? I mean, they don't even write their music! Or even play it! That's pretty sad. Now Hanson and The Moffatts, they WRITE AND PLAY AND SING their own music. How hard can that be? Plus, all their songs are alike and they are just the next Backstreet Boys. I WOULDN'T WASTE MY MONEY ON THIS CD IF I WERE YOU. UNLESS, YOU LIKE THE BACKSTREET BOYS (gag!)!!!~A NON-N'sync FanP.S. Look, N'sync fans, no hard feelings. Ok? :) I mean, this is a review. We can put our negative OR positive opinions about them! I mean, if you really liked them, you wouldn't care about what other people think..."
2,"Well, now that I own it, what do I do with it?","Well, lets see. Girls just can't get enough of 5 white guys that pass off as stars although Lord knows they work hard enough. I don't quite enjoy their music, for it makes me agitated. I have zero patience for these u l t r a s m o o t h ballads that makes girls swoon. I am a girl and I do not swoon. If I saw these guys on the street I prabably wouldn't even recognize them. This music would be perfect for those screaming ""N'SYNC ROCKS!"" I don't really care for this music. But if one likes artists like Britany Spears or Backstreet Boys, its for you! Who knows, maybe I can use my CD as a coaster, perhaps."
5,justin timberlake-enough said!!!!! 5 stars but should be<100,"justin timberlake and jc are so hot i just melted when they sung ""god must have........"" it is a realy good cd and its not just for ""teeny boppers"" my mom luvs them to i watch justin in ""i want u back"" on my computer everyday backstreet boys suck they r too old to have that name justins mom came up with a much more creative one but i have to say nick carter is hot but he is the only one besides justin and jc in my dreams please buy this cd!!!1"
1,Please........ someone..........make it stop!!!!!!,"This cd is full of meaningless lyrics and bad singing. It's bad enough that N'Sync don't write their own songs, but they've got horrible voices to sing them. Why do they have to copy the Backstreet Boys so much? They make BSB look bad. Too bad there isn't a zero star rating"
1,"N SYNC, ANOTHER FORMULATED MESS.","This CD only has one breakout song ""Tearin' Up My Heart"", the rest of the CD just sags, with ""I Drive Myself Crazy"", and ""God Must Have Spent A Little More Time On You"", ballads geared at the 10 year old girl....Give me Debbie Gibsons ""Lost In Your Eyes"" anytime before I have to swallow this garbage. The biggest laugh on this CD is even trying to do a remake of a Christopher Cross pop classic ""Sailing"". In 2 years it will be N Sync who?...Remember New Kids on the Block?,or Take That? or how about Rick Astley? They will be faded in the dust before the New Millenium."
2,Not so hot...,"'NSYNC's self-entitled (and first) album is not all it's cracked up to be. The boys can sing, but these tunes and lyrics just don't hit the mark. ""Here We Go"" and ""You Got It"" are really the only songs that are worth keeping the album for. You'll have to listen to this CD MANY times before you can actually remember the song titles and the order of the tracks. Get this... even 'NSYNC admits that they didn't really like their first album. If you're a die-hard 'NSYNC fan, go ahead and buy the CD. But ""No Strings Attached"" will give you much more satisfaction on the first play than the first CD ever will."
3,Girl from USA thought it was ok!,"I'm a teenager, but not really into pop or this kinda music. I like Korn, Limp Bizcut, & my idols are Marvin Gaya, Lauryn Hill, Lenny Kravit, & Madonna. But I thought the cd was pretty good. They sing alriught & I made me wana dance. But you know the comparisons between them and the Backstreet Boys, & I'd have to go for the Backstreet Boys. I think they sing a lot better. They're vocal abilities are really good. I thought Nsync sounded a lot like them, but they don't sing nearly as good. But I thought the cd was ok. It wouldn't be the worst investment in a cd."
1,What music shouldn't be.,"This CD is obviously fabricated and contains no musical talent. It is just one mushy love ballad after another. The only people that I can see liking this music are in the 10-12 year old range. This band doesn't even write their own lyrics. How can anyone think that this music shows emotion, when they're singing something that some stuffy middle aged man wrote in his corner office on the 39th floor of X Records Company HQ? It's sad that record companies sacrifice music in the pursuit of money. Spend your money on something else such as hed(pe) or Incubus (Or, if you like softer music, Lenny Kravitz or someone like that.) At least these people show musical talent."
2,a pure pop album,i bought the album after getting the singles I want you back and Tearing up my heart. But i was pretty dissapointed after hearing the rest of the album. they should get more of Max Martin songs instead. The songs like Giddy up and i drive myself crazy are very awful.
1,HORRIBLE,"I think that this CD was the worst thing i have ever heard. It has only one normal song which was i need love. The rest were horrible. All these boy bands make me puke. I mean, these days people with absolutely no talent are millionares. Only in America can people like nsync make it big."
1,dont get it,"where are all the GUITARS, BASS, and drumes. There music is all the same. You hear one song and then you heard the whole cd. Most of there songs are very slow. I think just there Good looks make up for there bad music (my opinion)I think if they focus on how to play some instruments and not always talk about love they will be alot more people wanting to hear there music."
5,This One You Can't Stop Listening To!,"This CD is great! There isn't 1 song on this CD that I don't like. They know how to make music! (Hint: Get the Enhanced CD, it's so cool!)"
5,Fun pop CD,"I got this CD about a year and a half ago when I was really into boybands. Now I'm pretty much over the boyband craze, but this is still a great CD. I Drive Myself Crazy is by far my favorite song on the CD. It's so beautiful. I also really like I Want You Back. In fact, all the songs are good with the exception of I Need Love, which is just stupid and boring. Giddy Up isn't good either, but it is entertaining. If you're a pop fan and don't have this CD, what's wrong with you?"
5,nsync is the number 1 boy pop band,I'm a huge 'Nsync fan and i love their music! This is a great cd and its in my cd player right now. I love the fact that they have different types of songs throughout the cd and now i'm a true fan. I'm waiting for their new album out in the fall!
3,"ok, but not the best","well, i fell in love with 'nsync after hearing i want you back. unfortunately, i thought they were the backstreet boys. after watching their concert on the disney channel, i bought their cd. i think it is a wonderful investment. the reason i feel this way is because whenever i am feeling sad or upset i play the cd. after hearing the songs for awhile i feel so much better!! this might sound dumb, but its true. although some of their songs sound kinda cheesy, i still love the cd."
3,they're not THAT great,"Okay, i'm not exactly reviewing the cd, but *N SYNC themselves. in my mind, who came first? *N SYNC or BSB? Duhhh! baisically,most of the ""new"" boy bands are BSB wannabes. i'm NOT saying that I don't like *N SYNC, because i do. But each member of the band(Bsb) has a different sound and each has a chance to do a solo. it's hard to tell who is singing what,in *N SYNC, because they all sound the same,(like Justin). i'm sure LOTS of people disagree, but that is just what I think.If I had to choose, I would side with the Backstreet Boys."
3,Im NOT a teenybopper (what a nice suprise!),"Ok, first- I can't say I hate them, since I dont personally KNOW them. Yes, they DO have a lot of talent, but have you noticed that they do a lot of stuff BSB does? In their tours, they BOTH come in on some sort of flying object, 'I Want You Back' sounds a lot like 'Everybody', and so on. I've also noticed that with all the females that reviewed it and gave it 5 stars, the first thing I read on all of them was commenting on their LOOKS! Does that have a THING to do with talent?"
4,great CD (o':'o),"I got this CD awhile ago but I still listen to a few of the songs. I think they all sound really good, but several of them have weak lyrics (like they were made up just to fill the CD). Although I still enjoy listening to this particular album! (^_^) I don't really have a fave on this CD, but I'm sure if u haven't bought it yet, you will! =) tankies 4 yur time!"
5,Awesome CD,"Hey People! This CD is so awesome! The songs are all cool and rock. So, everyone purchase this CD and trust me, you won't regret it! ;]"
5,I thought that the CD was excellent,"The beats were really good as were the lyrics. I liked the covers, especially Sailing. I liked how they had some slow songs and some fast songs. They have great voices and i love their harmonizing. They are also all very cute and can dance really well! I give the CD 5 stars."
2,"BLAH, BLAH, BLAH","I got this CD as a gift, thank God, because now I don't have to feel stupid for wasting my money on it. NSYNC basically incorporates a bunch of monotous, shallow, cinsistently sappy and relationship-dependent, needy, songs that all sound basicly alike. The only reason I gave it two stars is because a couple of the songs, if listened to once and not accompanied by the others, won't seem half-bad. I would not reccomen this CD to anyone who appreciates good music with meaning, and the only reason they are so popular is efficient advertising and publicity."
1,Good songs but bad blend of voices.,"Don't get me wrong, Nsync seems cool and nice and all but when you listen to their album I can't help but flinch. Great song writing and everything and the producers seem to do a great job with that but when you hear them singing, you'll flinch! The songs would be much better be sung my 98 degrees. Another BSB wanna be. They'll make it pretty good I'm sure but the songs just don't suit them! They have to go for more R&B or rock. Not for pop! Great try Nsync. Maybe your next album will be better!"
3,"it was okay , nuthin to get excited over","I like only a few songs from this cd. The rest are really lame. I like 'N sync a little better than The Backstreet Boys. I would buy this cd for the price of a single, it's not worth more than five bucks. Most of the songs are dorky and slow, and the annoying young voices get on my nerves!"
3,Slightly dissapointed...,"Having heard ""Tearin' Up My Heart"", ""I Want You Back"", and ""God Must Have Spent a Little More Time On You"" I was expecting better. *N Sync's music bears more than a slight resemblance to the Backstreet Boys's music."
4,Their CD is good enough to buy,"I think N Sync is group that has a lot of talent. At first I thought they were another ""money-hungry, fame-seeking, hot-shot"" wanna be group. At first I was skeptical to buy their CD, but when I did I soon found out I was wrong. They sing pretty well with each other, but I wouldn't say this is the best CD in the world. (Also, their looks drove me to buying this CD as well!!)"
4,Good,"'N Sync is a really talented group. I have a different CD version, but it has most of the songs, and they are really worth listening to, especially HERE WE GO and When I want you back. They aren't anywhere near as good as the Backstreet boys, but then again who is."
4,Awesome Product,Fun:This toy ROCKS! I like how they added an RPM gauge to show how fast the wheels go. I wish that they included 4 wheels instead of just 2.Duabilaty:I have had this thing for three years and not a bit of harm has come to it(exept when my baby sister gets involved).Educational:There is none whatsoever.(Exept perhaps finding out what RPM means)As you can see it's an all around great toy which is the reason I gave it 4 stars.
2,What?,"After seeing this band numerous times, I became intranced with their musicianship and songs. I bought Straigharound and wore it out and eagerly awaited their major label debut. This album represents all that is wrong with major label honcho's. They took a fresh, musical, hip sound and made it into something that it shouldn't be. All of the previoulsy recorded songs were made worse and the new stuff sounded like it should be on the next Disney soundtrack. The label really messed this up and missed the boat with this band. I hope they rebound and someone recognizes the supreme talent that is AGR!"
4,A deep look into the relationship gap in male friendship,"Locking Arms by Stu Weber is a profound book. He examines the importance of male friendships throughout history and in the Bible between Jesus and his diciples. I found the book to be a vital tool in understanding the complexity and difficulty of establishing long term male frienships. This book surely sheds light on the missing link of masculine friendships. If we don't lock arms as the author illustrates using many examples, then we are destined to exit to the False Roads To Manhood, abandoning the essence of male friendship, share values, unselfish love, deep loyalty, and real transparency to reach authentic manhood."
2,Not one of the best,"After finishing the eighth book in the Jane Jeffry Mystery series, I was disappointed. I like to start at the beginning of the series. This way I feel like I am not missing any important character development. I could have skipped ""War and Peas"". I was disappointed in the ending. It didn't come as a surprise (I did think that it was someone else). The ending came out of the blue. Miss Churchill attempted to pull it together but it just didn't work for me. The topic that she chose to tie the book together was out of character from her previous novels. I hope that her next novel takes a different path."
5,Mr. B. Duhn,"Terrific hit with our son-in-law, in fact we will more than likely order one for ourselves. It's light weight but durable."
4,Zoom V.92 V.44 56K PC-Card Modem for Laptop,"Excellent product, good knowledgeable support from Zoom tech staff, even if, as I did, one screws up on something only remotely related to their product."
5,The New Southwest Home Love it...,"Great book, really enyoy reading it and all the photographs are truely awesome, it inspires me to decorate every room in my home. I recomend it to anyone who appreciates Southwest style...."
2,Not recommended,"Very small tracking pad, not friendly keyboard, low quality speaker and microphone, relatively slow (with 2MB RAM)."
3,Frog and Toad Apart...,"I grew up reading Frog and Toad and was saddened to see that this book, Frog and Toad Together, is sold with only Frog. The irony here is pretty unbelievable. I actually have the Frog and the quality is fine. I just wished that they also sold Toad. I looked at the manufacturers website (crocodile creek) and searched online but they are only selling Frog. Oh well. I guess kids will have to understand the importance of friendship without having Frog's friend..."
3,Get the 2nd edition,Get the 2nd edition; the first is terrible. There are a lot of misprints and some sections are completely duplicated exactly.
5,"Practical, useful and certainly needed","It seems like a no-brainer that people should say please and thank you and excuse me, but how often do we all have the opposite experience? This book covers the basics of etiquette along with other scenarios that you might not run into but once in a lifetime.. Ways to handle important business dinners/meeting, gifting, disagreements, and more are covered in an easy and readable format. No boring lists or feeling like you are reading something written by surly old school marm with a bun so tight she can't blink. Good reading for anyone who wants to present their best front in any social situation."
3,Good for starters,"I have liked the book and it covers many social, family and work environment situations, so it is good to have. However, in some instances it mixes American and European Etiquette (and twice already I have found mistakes between the two). It is really ""for dummies"" so if you are knowledgable in this area you will find this far too vague. However, it still had points to learn although I will still have to buy another one more advanced to complement it."
3,Third season compared to First Season,"The third season has less depth compared to the first and second seasons. However, third season has a spice of culture in it makes it standing out of all seasons. If there are more coming seasons/episodes; more cultural spice and consideration to the socioeconomic status would be highly recommended for the justice of diversity of our society."
1,Missing parts,I recieved the costume with missing parts. It looked like the bag had been opened before it was shipped to me. I was missing the parts that held the hat up and the hat itself. I had to buy another hat and find a metal rod to replace the one that i didnt get.I emailed the company and got no response back.
5,East African History brought to life,"This is a book that I read ten years ago but has remained at the top of my list for Non Fiction. It covers the history of East Africa from the early slave trading of the Arabs at Mombasa and Zanzibar right up to the 1920's.It's main story is the building of the Mombassa to Kenya railroad, which includes the story of the Man-eating Lions of Tsavo.The whole book carries one along much as a passenger on the Railroad with a fast pace and more detail than the eye could take in with the feast of information that passes.Thinking about it makes me want to take the train trip from Mombassa to Kenya, which still runs today."
4,Like it or not- HE WAS COUNTRY !,"I have this album on vinyl, so I can hear how its supposed to sound. John Denver was a Folk-Country artist. Someone commented how this Album is not Country Music. They must not know anything about- or very little about Country Music. Because Country is not just one thing- its a lot of things- and John Denver was certainly more Country than Rock or Pop or Classical. His songs like ""Thank God , I'm a Country Boy"" Annies Song"" and ""Rocky Mountain High"", and of course ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"" are all Country Classics. What a brilliant voice and songwriter he was."
5,Now on DVD...finally!,"I saw this film a couple years ago at a film festival and thought is was hilarious. Always wondered what happened to it, because I was sure some studio would pick it up. Glad to see that the general public can now discover this gem. The other reviewer is right: Gaffigan is great. You want to hate him for being such a nimrod, but there's a quality about him that makes him endearing, too. A great mixture of real humor and real touching moments. Hint: Listen very carefully to the lyrics of Tommy's ""French"" serenade. It make all those years of high school French worth it!"
5,Vaya manera de hacer música!!!,"Tanto me ha gustado Luminescence (French version) que no quise quedarme con las ganas de tener el mismo material en inglés, y oh sorpresa, me quedo maravillado de lo bien que se escuchan todos y cada uno de los temas, en ningún momento da la impresión de ser ""la versión en inglés de..."" pocas artistas como Anggun pueden lograr esa magia, en verdad que me quito el sombrero.Entre mis favoritas están: Undress me / C'est écritRescue me / Cesse la pluieIn your mind / tre une femmeCaptivity / Captivitéy en general todas las canciones del disco."
3,"Elivis Presey Aloha,from Hawaii via satilite","Satalite Audio and Vidio during the 70's, the time tis was broadcast, was not nearly as well done as today, but this cd was pretty well done, all things considered.All in all I woild purchase it again. The cost was a minimal compared to most cd's one and it contails the ""American Anthem"" which for so long I have been unable to locate. Only because Elivis is Elivis, and is the King of course. no matter what format he had to use. Need I say more?"
3,Decent book about the greatest world leader of all times,"I totally disagree with the customer from Northern Ireland who gave this book a bad review. He must be a fantatic fundamentalist. Bhutto was possibly the greatest world leader of all times, period! The book gives some detail about his era, but better books are yet to come."
1,Absolute biggotory,"Rafi Raza was a big beuru crat, puppet, cheater, ji-huzoor, government official appointed by Bhuuto who himself one of the most notable self made dictator, non-believer in deen-e-islam, all of his assistants, partymen, cabinet, ministers, government servants were 'nanng-e-deen, nanng-e-watan and nanng-e-milat.One of the most corrupt, cheater, cruel, croock clown of all time in history and the one one who misguided our nation and damadged our reputation in the world. Rafi can only write what a slave can write for his master. It is a similar book like Ayub wrote 'his master's voice'.This book could never be treated as a serious reference in our politics. Bhutto, Benazir and all otheir men were like Salman Rushdi of this era. To say something about them is the insult of serious critics."
4,Nicely Done Recording,"The original recording was a product of the 60's. It is well done musically and the cannons heard in the pieces are synchronized to the musical score, as the composers indicated.The cannons are authentic of the time of the battles and the sound of the firings good. The explanation of how they engineered the microphone setup and fired the cannons is given in commentary as an extra. This is interesting as well.The music itself is well known in the case of Tchailovsky's 1812 Overture. Beethoven's Wellington's Victory is not as well known. It's a lesser Beethoven but still interesting. It's written for popular consumption so lively. In the Beethoven, the different armies, French and English, are separated in the right and left speakers. Their approach, the battle, and the conclusion is indicated in the separate speakers. The battle is between the forces of Wellington and those of Bonaparte in Vittoria, Spain June 21rst, 1813."
2,Missing CD,I never received the CD. So I contacted my credit card company and asked them to charge back to item to Amazon.
1,Less than ideal,"I bought this because I am making a set of morris chairs that require a lot of mortising. The primary problem that I have had is that the chisel holder tends to slip up the quill and that it takes a LOT of pressure to drill the holes. I eventually fixed part of the slipping problem by putting a hose clamp above the chisel holder on the quill, but then the holder started slipping over the ring that goes between the chisel holder and the quill. Finally, in an effort to tighten it enough, I broke the handle on the chisel holder. All in all I am fairly unhappy and quite disappointed."
2,Fit and Finished,"The attachment seemed like a good product, but did not fit my Craftsman drill as it said it would. Now, I had to pay shipping back to Amazon.com. I'm not happy with that!"
3,Mortising Bit Review,"This product provides to many attachmems for the home workshop.I am trying to find a mortising bit that will cut a square hole 3/8 "" in 3/4 wood that is commonly used in home shop projects. I couldn't find the size of the shanks on the bits to see if they would fit my drill press."
5,Watch out!!!,I am using this mill for spice grinding. As I utilize hot pepper spices you need to be cautious when opening the machine post grinding as there is a puff of spice laden air exhausted which can be quite toxic. Therefore go outside and open it up (make sure to take note of the wind direction) or open up the grinder under an exhaust fan.Interms of coffee grinding a technique I have learned on other machines is when the quality of the sound of the grinding changes to a higher pitch the grind is complete.
3,"Good, not great.","Fast, and really quiet, and very good for spices. But it leaves large pieces when grinding nuts such as pecans. Also tough to clean."
4,"Great, economical coffee grinder","Coffee grinder was reasonably priced, mills whole beans into a fine grind in seconds, and arrived in just a few days from Amazon."
1,Not worth the money,"We have purchased Krups grinders previously, but I am very disappointed with this model. The lid is difficult to twist shut. Static electricity builds up in both the bowl and the lid, making it hard to get the coffee into the filter holder without scraping. Turning the unit upside down and tapping the coffee into the lid does not help, as its large size and awkward shape make it hard to fill a smaller filter holder without dropping the grinds all over the counter.We purchased this unit about a month ago, and are already looking for a replacement."
5,Excellent Grinder,I've been using my Krups grinder for a few years now with no problems & no complaints. Highly recommend...A+++++
2,coffee and spice grinder,I find that the product pulverizes the coffeebeans rather than grinding them The result is a powdery mess. I am going back to my old Braun.
5,"Great projects, great drawings, great discussion on methods",This book has great drawings on methods of construction for cabinet work. Many drawings for each project showing router and saw use methods along with materials lists and stock cutting diagrams.There are 11 projects with many drawer and door variations for each. From small display cases to large wardrobes. Very good looking designs. Each project has detailed construction sequences and shop tips.Nice spiral binding hard cover makes for a book that lays open perfectly for shop use.
4,Item never arrived. It was out of stock. I got a refund.,I wish I had the VHS tape to review! 4 star rating is based on my memory of the movie from cable TV.
1,Waste of Money... wish I could give it 0 stars !!,BOOOOO !!!Bad product that leaves a film on your floor !! this is more like an attractant than deterrent!! my dog still pees in the same spot and I have been using this junk for 4 months!!DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY !! Vinager works far better than this crap !!!
4,Shifts in perspective,"In ""Stargazer"" Watson has crafted a captivating narrative with a nice balance between the personalities who pioneered the development of the telescope and the technology they developed, generously sprinkled with informative anecdotes. However the story I read between the lines was about the science that enabled shifting from an Earth centered perspective to acceptance of our place in this vast Universe. And it raises the question: What science will enable another shift in perspective from belief in a deity `out there' somewhere controlling the Universe to acceptance that such belief comes from `in here' deep in our human nature? If you're intrigued by such questions, check out Amazon's webpages on my book, ""Concepts: A ProtoTheist Quest for Science-Minded Skeptics."""
1,Not what we were expectig,The book seemed poorly put together and was not of the substance or quality of what we were expecting. We returned it.
3,OK CD,AT THE TIME THIS CD CAME OUT THE ONLY CD OUT THERE WAS THE BEST OF SAM COOKE SO AT THAT TIME THIS CD WAS THE BEST OUT THERE.
4,Sam Cooke - Greatest Hits CD,I enjoy it very much. However there were songs on the CD that I don't remember at all.
4,A Great Composer,Probably the most underrated song writer since Harry Warren. This CD is not quite as comprehensive as I should have wished
5,Gotta love Sam Cooke!,"I do believe he is and always will be the best at what he does. His music can always touch a little part of your heart when you listen to it. And as for ""Another Saturday Night"" not being on any other recordings, look again. I own ""The Best Of"" that has this song on it! Luck, huh?"
2,disappointed,"Portrait of A Legend is much much better, wished that I hadn't bothered to buy this one as well as ""Portrait"""
2,jacque le blew- this blew!!!!!!!!,"i take back my title , maybe this movie just wasn't for everyone. the dubbing was awful, and story just dragged on for too long. but all isn't lost........ the movie is visually stunning!! thats it take it or leave it!"
5,This One Makes it to My Hall of Fame,"I'm very stingy with my HOF rating only a hand full of films achieve this lofty status. The City of Lost Children is most deserving. The cinematography alone makes this one worth watching, one of the most visually stimulating films ever produced. In the tradition of Brazil and A Clockwork Orange this film excites the imagination and provokes the mind. The plot is inventive and original. A must see for all 'thinking' movie goers."
3,Don't believe the art-cinema crowd...,"This movie is not that great. If you're expecting violence and nudity (it is rated 'R' after all) you won't find it here. What you will find is a half-way decent story and acting, and a plot that moves slower than molasis in january. The mise-en-scene is BEAUTIFUL however, so if you're an artsy-fartsy kinda person, you'll like it. But if you're an average movie-goin'-joe, skip this one."
2,HMMM...,"There always has to be one, just one, review which rises to the surface like a fetid sore along side all the sloppy adulation. This is that review. Sorry.Granted, the film is visually opulent, with it's shimmering vistas and expansive dystopia's, but if this is the yardstick against which films should be judged, then Tarsem Singh (The Cell) would be an uber-director by now (with his eye-popping use of religious iconography an the like). Clearly he is not. The film is as empty as a tooth cavity made by too many trips to the sweet shop."
3,Boring but Pretty,"This movie is absolutely beautiful. The cinematography, the colors, the fanciful sets. However, it is pretty boring. I didn't like it because it was too dark and hard to follow. I also didn't like the subtitles; it made it hard to see all of the beautiful sets. I don't recommend buying it but if you want to see what all the 5 star reviewers are raving about, go ahead and rent it. But get a second movie for when you turn this one off."
2,"Visually interesting, boring otherwise.","I really liked most of the visuals and quirky style. There was a little annoying CGI but done in at least reasonable amounts.As far as being stylized, it was very interesting. I wish it could have been applied to a better story.The acting also was pretty poor by many of the main actors which caused the story to drag even more.It was very nice to look at but the story just bored me.Seeing how popular garbage like the Matrix is just for visual style (with its combination innovative camera work and crappy CGI) minus content, I guess how I can see how this gets such rave reviews.It's visually far superior to the Matrix but at the same level storywise."
4,Baron Munchausen meets Dark City,"This is a very interesting film. It has the dark and ominesence type of story, and environment, of Dark City; while still maintaining the more family friendly feel of a film like Baron Munchausen. It actually works quite well. A movie to be recommended to anyone above 8 years old (although it may be a bit frieghtening to some children), this is a well balanced story that captures your attention with a tale of morality, life, and love.As far as the movie itself all aspects are par, nothing jumps put as being particularly special, but you don't notice anything wrong with it either. However, the acting is above average. An important note is also that I have only viewed the French audio version with subtitles, so I cannot comment on the dubbed audio."
4,Schtick over shadows singing.,"Listening to the summit recording puts you at your own private table with the Rat Pack. Sammy Davis's rendition of ""What Kind of Fool am I"" is a highlight. Although the banter is interesting I could have done with more music. The packaging is a class act."
5,"Ocean sound, make me sleep better.","I tried this CD because doesn't have music, only Ocean Waves and on final track you hear nothing being silent.I feel great and I will recommend for someone that like to sleep better and also get the results.I also purchased one with music and their choice of music it is unbelievable."
5,Eye-Opening,"This is one of my most treasured books. So wonderfully written, I felt like I was literally attending these feasts. Very eye-opening to end time events."
1,Paris,Had some good intrigue and plot twist but some of the acting left much to be desired. Bai Ling once again proves you never know if she will act or smile her way through a movie.
4,Backgrounds to Dispenationalism,"I read Bass's book sometime ago. He is factual and doesn't ""demonize"" those with whom he doesn't agree. I think every ""self-honest"", serious Dispensationalist should give it a read.In addition, I suggest a second, more recent book, that deals less with the history of Dispensationalism and more with the Lord's plea for all true believers to heed ignore His multiple warnings (i.e., don't explain them away) and to be ""overcomers"". Oh yes! the book in question is ""Talks on Revelation"", by Floyd Police"
1,A Waste of Time,This book was horrible! It was too long and had many errors. Is there really a guy out there who would be OK with his girlfriend sleeping with someone else? I don't think so! A real waste of time and money!
3,A Promising Story....But...,"A promising story...ButThe main character, Venice is a college student in a three way relationship with long time boyfriend Jarvis and college sweetie Craig. Venice has a decision to make. Unfortunately I knew the ending right away.The story line was promising but D. Lee lost me in the writing. There were quite a few grammatical errors. The dialog between the characters was juvenile, choppy and stilted. There where no real twist and turns, and too many unnecessary details for such a simple plot.I had to give it three stars instead of one because while the plot was unbelievable, it was still somewhat enjoyable. Come one ladies you know the typical. Two good strong minded women fighting over a no good triflin man. Well why not the other way around for once."
2,Double Yuck,"Please don't buy this book. Maybe you can borrow it from someone. They talk about the same thing throughout the whole book. A group of collge kids. One girl Venice, who can't make up her mind who she wants to be with. (Her high school sweetheart or a new guy she meets in college) This is all that goes on in the entire book .Don't waste your money.Email me. You can have my copy.Denise"
2,"Details are important, but.....","Number one, this book was TOO LONG. The plot was okay, but it was soooooo dragged out that by the time I got to the end I felt exhausted. Fifty-something chapters is just too much for a story with such a simple plot. I also felt like Jarvis' character was never fully developed, so I found myself disappointed when Venice didn't end up with Craig.The main problem I found with this novel was that there were just TOO MANY DETAILS. Details do enhance a novel, but there were so many tedious details that did nothing to advance the plot. Most of the sentences were choppy, and there were inumerable fragments.Ms. Lee seems like she could have a future as an author, but her writing needs much more polishing. I wish her the best of luck, and I would recommend this book if you're just looking for something to read to pass the time."
4,Tribute to a great song writer,"Otis Blackwell wrote some of the greatest hits for Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Jimmy Jones, Little Willie John and others, among them ""All shook up"", ""Don't be cruel"", ""Great balls of fire"", ""Fever"", ""Breathless"", ""Return to sender"", etc. On this tribute album, 15 of those hits are performed by an equal number of different artists such as Graham Parker, Dave Edmunds, Paul Rodgers, Willie DeVille, Kris Kristoferson, Marcia Ball, Chrissie Hynde to name just a few, with new arrangements and without being devaluated nor loosing the slightest bit of magic of the original recordings at all. Among all of them, my favorites are ""Hey little boy(little girl)"" performed by Chrissie Hynde and Chris Spending, ""Don't be cruel"" by Deborah Harry, ""Great balls of fire"" by Joe Ely, Sue Foley, Marcia Ball and Sarah Brown, and ""Return to sender"" by Dave Edmunds."
1,"Oh man, is this tedious.","Being a huge fan of the Simpsons, I was excited to finally get my hands on this book and delve into the minds who create such poingnant social satire. The fact that the book was in the bargain bin should have been a tip off....this book book is plain awful.There seems to be a prevailing sentiment in the book that the voices make the show, and while the voices certainly are integral, the writing makes the show. Ms Cartwright seems to be in denial of this fact. She is certainly a talented voice-over actess, and she should send the writers a present daily for rescuing her from a world of ""My Little Pony""....."
4,the voice of Bart,"[...]Although not as detailed as I would have liked, Nancy still offers a unique insider's perspective on the creation of each Simpsons episode. From the writers and storyboard artists' conceptions to the final product, the book takes the reader through the entire process of what it's like to produce an animated television show.Nancy also gives a brief account of her journey through the business of voice-over artist. She starts with her humble beginnings in school plays and speech competitions through working with her mentor, Daws Butler (Huckleberry Hound, Fred Flintstone, Yogi Bear, etc.).In short, this was a very interesting and informative book even if it was, at times, a little ""self-serving."" But then again, what else do you expect from an autobiography?]...]"
5,Selden seen,"An enterprising if not quirky little anthology from the once ubiquitous Rodman which shows, I think, what has been lost in the sense of general acculturation. First we're whisked round some more or less weird translations (Rodman's version of Zone particularly ham-fisted) from Corbière to Michaux, from Rilke to Marinetti, then we move briskly from Yeats and Owen, Fearing and Stein, via a satire section to lighten the tone (everyone from Eliot to Auden to AD Hope) to the present - as then was - including a passage from The Naked and the Dead which evidently didn't tempt me to take it further. Crikey, guv'ner - not bad for 1949! Churlish I know to look for absentees, but I feel William Empson would have fit right in"
3,Inspired by Christ Our Mediator,"Mahaney's book, ""Christ Our Mediator,"" is a wonderful discussion of the significance of Jesus to our relationship with Father God.Mahaney has an engaging writing style that is not difficult to understand, but plainspoken. He uses excellent illustrations to begin each chapter, and he gets to his point very quickly. Several of his illustrations are very poignant and memorable; they gave me a renewed appreciation for truths learned long before. He also is not guilty of ""over-selling"" the point as some theologians are prone to do.The point I found most excellent was Mahaney's encouragement to go beyond ourselves and see things from both God's and Christ's perspective, to not be motivated by our subjective feelings, but by God's objective truth.The book is a brief one that lends itself well to devotional reading and reflection on the ministry of Christ."
4,Surprisingly Enjoyable!,"Ringo toured with so many great singers/musicians, from so many excellent bands! The songs in this anthology are great, and it's always (well almost always) great to hear Ringo. One of our last Beatles' ... it makes me so nostalgic. Thoroughly enjoyable!"
5,Clean air again,"Over the past four years, my original filter had finally clogged with fine dust - primarily mahogany. The replacement filter was well protected for shipping, and delivered within two days. Removal of the old filter and installation of the new was a tool-less operation that only took a minute or so. The clogging indicator immediately dropped to it's original level, and after a few hours, the air in my shop cleared up nicely."
2,DISAPPOINTED!! THIS IS NOT A CD!,"EVEN THOUGH THIS PACKAGING LOOKS LIKE A CD, IT IS NOT!! UPON RECEIVING THIS, I DISCOVERED IT TO BE A AUDIO CASSETTE. EVEN THOUGH THE SONGS THAT ARE LISTED ON THE BOX ARE THOSE FROM THE FIFTIES, I DID NOT OPEN THE WRAPPING. I HAVE NO NEED FOR THIS. I REPORTED THIS TO AMAZON TELLING THEM I FEEL THE CUSTOMERS TO BE MISLED FROM THE PICTURE, THEY AGREED. OLDIES.COM IS SELLING THIS PRODUCT, I DON'T FIND THEM TO BE FLEXIBLE OR HELPFUL."
5,"Great songs played with energy, skill, and humor!","I bought this record on the strength of ""Fine Artiste Blues"" back when it first came out. I'd always enjoyed R. Crumb's art work and I knew this collection would be something different. It's a grab bag of styles all played with old-timey string band instrumentation. ""Alabama Jubilee"" is also a standout, but there are really no clinkers. Plenty of Hawaiian guitar and some GREAT musical saw. The overall feel of the album is lighthearted and casual, but the level of musicianship is actually quite high. Can't think of another group that comes close to the Suits' sound so you'll just have to hear them for yourself. You won't be disappointed. I have gone back to this recording many times over the years and it always brings a smile."
5,Crumb sings!,"This is a thoroughly delightful disc, one I listen to frequently. It's also one of the two Cheap Suits' discs that you can easily find, at least in my experience. Grab it and growl. Crumb has nice 20's falsetto voice that does the material enjoyable justice and the instrumentals are lovingly played. Yeah, there are a few missed notes here and there, but this is just super stuff. Thanks to R. Crumb for pointing us in the direction of this music. There are hundreds and hundreds of discs coming out with rarities that used to only be heard in the basements of collectors. Learn more about the beauties of American music before WW2. You can start right here."
2,Cheap!!!!,"The quality of Hon Vertical files are just not there anymore, they have cheap fronts that you can practically dent with your finger. the lateral files have a double wall with steel re-inforcements on them... File cabinets have gotten ridiculous in price and crap in quality."
5,Terrific reading - excellent history!,"This book is one of the best history lessons of Africa I have ever had. It taught me more about Africa than I would have learned in any one semester course - from the early navigational schools of the Portugese and the inability of early sailing ships to tack and sail south, to Stanley and Livingston (whom I had always thought to be a missionary and not the explorer he is portayed as in this book) and on to Leopold's desire to carve his own little fiefdom, the Belgian Congo, which not even the Belgians wanted. For anyone wanting to educate themselves on the history of Africa this is a must read - educational, erudite, and well written."
1,Widow's Peak in the wrong zone for a climb,"Unfortunately, we received a DVD for zone 2. The invoice did not show this information, and we opened and tried to play it. The company offered refund of $3.00 only. We have asked Amazon's help to resolve for a full refund, but nothing has happened to date. Be very careful when ordering."
3,An comedy set in 20's Ireland,"A very pretty English girl arrives in a small Irish town,and begins a plan to marry the town's leading widow's son.A feud with a local woman leads to some ""accidents"" andhard feelings then rumors of murder.There is a strange twisted ending.I didn't much like this film as it was all kind ofa patterned game that didn't seem all that realeven with some pretty good acting."
4,Good and worth listening to,I'm not really qualified to judge this type of music. How would ***I*** know what great classical spanish guitar sounds like.But what I can say is this: I thoroughly enjoyed it.
2,Content is a disppointment,"While Los Romeros had a valid claim to the record's title, and their playing was generally flawless, I found this disk to be a disappointing collection. I thought I was going to hear the unique sound of a four high caliber guitarists playing as a quartet. Its actually a collection of solos, some duets, with only a couple pieces where its evident 3 or more are playing. And, while the performances were technically excellent, most seemed somewhat flat and lacked the personality expected of the classical guitar. Many of the pieces are 16th and early 17th century pre-Baroque works. The saving grace is the Mercury ""Living Presence"" mastered recording, reknown for acoustic quality. On a good audio system, the Romeros are right there in the listening room with you."
4,"Great condition, great price","The book arrived very quickly, and although used, is in great condition inside & out... and the price was certainly right!"
1,How Can I?,The album title sounds like something I'd be interested in buying --but how can I find out? None of the songs are listed!
5,FIND THIS BOOK!,"John Nance manages to describe the intimate details of the rise and fall of this incredible airline, and he manages to leave you on the edge of your seat! An incredible book, and highly reccomended to those with an interest in avation or airlines."
3,Surfin' with the Astronauts/Everything is A-OK! [2-on-1 CD],"If you are into ""surfing"" type music and want to listen to the Astronauts at their best, the ""Surfin' with the Astronauts"" album (tracks 1-12 on this 2-on-1 CD) is an excellent example of a great surf band playing great ""Surf Classics"" music e.g mostly instrumentals with lots of classic guitar reverb, and includes their big hit ""Baja"". The ""Everything is A-OK!"" album (tracks 13-23 on this 2-on-1 CD), however, is about as far from the surfing genre as you can get, for any surf band, including the Astronauts. This album is a 1963 live recording (not studio) at a club in Boulder, Colorado and includes many hits made famous by other artists, but none are of the surfing genre and none are instrumental. The live music is well done by the Astronauts, but for my money should not have been labeled nor included on this CD as ""Surf Classics""."
4,Great Appendix,"This book has a wonderful appendix full of web sites you can go to for lesson plans, curriculum, etc. Appendix alone is worth taking a look at this book."
5,Awesome shirt,I actually purchased this a few years ago and am now just writing a review. Just wanted to say that the shirt has held up very well and still looks new after wearing it for a few years.
2,Spell check,This is my first review I just thought my opinions should be shared for those considering buying this book. Anyway here goes. I thought this was an excellent book on the history of the great Jimi Hendrix. I wish someone would have spell checked this book before it was published. Other than the redundant misspellings I loved the book.I would have given the book more stars however I believe to do so would be misleading.I hope this was some help.
1,you'll be disappointed,"The problem with this CD is that the music for fife and drum isnot played with fifes; it's played with PICCOLOS. If you're a fife lover like me you'll be disappointed. Maybe the musicianson this ensemble weren't skillful enough to play the fife andresorted to the piccolo, which has keys and therefore is mucheasier to play. And the bugle calls are actually trumpet calls!"
4,Three Camps,"I am enjoying ""The Spirit of '76 and Ruffles and Fourishes"" a great deal; the drum patterns alond with the fife/piccolo as well as the bugle tunes are very well played. The recording quality is excellent. Most of all, I am enjoying the adherence to perpetuating the tradition of the original music. Thanks."
3,"Standard fare, tho hard to find","Unless you're a historian or a music/history teacher, there probably isn't much call for Rev War military music. Not only music, but the quicksteps and command tunes used to communicate orders to the troops, both in camp and in battle.This is an expansive collection, showcasing key tunes for both the Continentals and Her Majesty's armies. Many will easily be recognized as having been adopted in our native lexicon and become part of our social fabric."
3,Meh,"Somehow after seeing all the previews I expected more from this movie. I expected it to be really funny and clever. This idea of an afterlife for people who kill themselves is intriguing. I was greatful that the movie doesn't try to be laugh-out-loud funny, but it ends up dragging a bit. It also tries too hard to be bittersweet and charming."
3,"I've never seen so much cabbage, symmetrically arranged!","This book does a fine job of showing us what one can do with vegetables if one wants to make designs in the garden, rather than simply grow and devour the poor plants. The problem is, this only goes so far. After ten or so suggestions for arranging Swiss chard and cabbage, beautiful though they may be, I got the point rather quickly. Though I am glad to have seen this book and spent some time with the pictures, I would not want to reserve a space on my shelf for it."
2,"Good spec PSU, failed to deliver!","The spec of this PSU looked quite good, but this particular item was dead on arrival! So I can't say much more than that! Return for credit went fine, so nothing to complain about other than some wasted time."
3,Mis-advertised,"You advertise the Fanny and Alexander (Special Edition Two-Disc Set) and as we scroll down it becomes clear that it's a five disc set. Get it together, guys!"
5,Excellent,"I am not one that likes drama movies, I usually go for the cultish comedies and such. But, at the reccomendation of a friend, I bought Fanny and Alexander. This is one incredible movie. I watched the whole thing at once, all 3 hours, and was ready to watch it again afterwards. This is an incredibly entertaining and engrossing movie. I strongly suggest that this be watched by everyone."
4,Scholarly Work that Also Serves Layman,"Since I'm not a scholar, I cannot judge whether this is the best of the many translations and explications of Popol Vuh. Although the footnotes make it perhaps more detailed than an ordinary reader can digest, I learned a great deal about the Maya by reading this. Fascinating stories with fascinating parallels to legends of other religions, including Jewish and Christian."
4,A beautiful prince,"To my greatest surprise, this superb puppet from Folmanis better suffers to be thrown up and down than I expected. However, that was on a one year observation, I do not know what the long term reserves. Other thing, because I deal with young children, I do not know how to clean it. Finally the combination with puppets of other manufacturers is more or less a cosmetic issue due to the size and style. Combined with a Papageno (the magic flute) and Papagena I had made, the kids did not blink. Reaction good to keep in mind for the worry was only mine.Claude"
4,"Rocky start, but good tower","I ordered this computer, and called the seller to purchase expedited shipping. I had to buy a new monitor too, but bought it locally. It didn't come with Microsoft Office, but for the price, you can't really complain too much about that. After about a week, the settings got messed up somehow, and I had to call Geek Squad to help me get everything working again. All in all, I feel like this is a good computer."
5,Nice Silver Chain,"Lovely chain and great price. I am fond of Silver jewelry because of the shine and the low price compared to the price of gold these days. I prefer yellow gold and always will, but I have been priced out of my hearts desire. LOL<heavy sigh> But, be that as it may this is a great chain at a great price. It was delivered promptly and so I was pleased."
1,still havent recvied had to by a new one,i moved and changed my address checked my old mail of two weeeks and still its not the or here and i had to buy a new one
5,Frank at his absolute best! Get it!,"This is the first television special and in many ways it it unequalled (although I haven't seen them all yet). Sinatra is in great form, his voice powerful and playful. He appears to be having a great time and it is well communicated. The opening with ""Under My Skin"" is exhilirating and goes down in Television history as ""one of those moments"". By all means...order this DVD if you haven't seen it. Also, check out A Man and His Music +Ella +Jobim; it is just as wonderful!"
3,unexpected,"It wasn't what I expected, but I did get a better understanding of where my child is. He wasn't diagnosed until the age of 10 and I have not had a good understanding until now of the problems he has in the world."
3,frustration,"Wired Visikey Keyboard Large Print Pc and MacintoshI'm sure this is a good product, but it didn't work with the USB ports on my Dell PC. I called the company, and they were initially helpful, though they couldn't figure out why it wouldn't work on any of the ports on my PC. They said they'd send me another one, but my phone calls since then have gone unanswered. I have returned the keyboard for refund. I am disappointed, because it looked like a great product."
2,keys dont work,"I bought this for my mother and when she got it, one third of the keys didnt work, not happy with it at all, and they wont return somthing that been open, so watch what you get,They will take it back,and I feel all will be back, I just hope my next online shopping experience with amazon is better and what I buy works."
2,Not that terrific..,"I was glad I could rent this one from Netflix first because it definately saved me money. The first film, CARNIVAL OF CRIME, is a perfect match. By that I mean it's an awful movie with an equally awful transfer. The movie is supposed to be about an architect searching for his missing wife, only he ends up finding out about her many infidelities. The story was really dull and the audio and video was extremely low grade. In fact about 10 minutes into the film, it seems to switch to a completely different film (soundtrack and all) and then switches back again. The second movie, THE HOSTAGE, was not too bad. The audio and video was excellent and it's in widescreen. The story about a boy getting trapped inside a moving van driven by a psycho-killer moving man was OK. The little boy actually does a good acting job. It wouldn't be a big loss if you missed seeing either one of these films. If you are really curious about this DVD, do yourself and your wallet a favor and RENT IT FIRST!!"
3,This show was my all-time favorite!!!,"I thought I was the only person who remembered Pinwheel!!! And how at the end of the opening, a girl would giggle and the sand would blow away!!! <sigh> This even tops the Fraggles!I remember Pinwheel's version of Oscar the Grouch and the two kids who would play ""Gotcha Last!""They really need to make a tape or DVD of this wonderful family-friendly show!!!!"
2,Type is tiny tiny tiny - too tiny to read,"This book looks quite interesting, and I was looking forward to reading it, but I have never in my life seen any book with type so tiny. The font size appears to be half that of other books on my shelf... I mean it's small. I am not sure I'll really be able to read this book due to the small font size, though I plan to try reading it in small doses. I can't imagine why they would have done this. Honestly, I would have been happy to have paid a little more for the additional paper that would have been needed to use a readable font size. I can't really rate this as it is so hard to read (so I have not read it), and content doesn't do much good if it is a struggle to see it. So the star rating has nothing to do with content."
4,Good storytelling,"They may not be fashionable nowadays, but the short stories of Leopoldo Alas aka Clarín, are well worth being read. He tells simple but extremely humane stories of Northern Spain, mostly set in the countryside or in small villages. His style is direct, realistic, and it combines tenderness with subtle irony. The most famous, ""Goodbye, Cordera"" tells the sad story of two kids whose beloved cow is sent to the slaughterhouse. Good for a slow evening at home, you'll be worthily entertained and get a glimpse of life in rural Northern Spain a hundred years ago."
2,Skip it,"The film is inaccurate (ignorant of how early porno films began), shows boring parts of boring films (explicitly cuts hard-core scenes), a know-it-all narrator won't shut up with his useless unimaginative commentary, absurd newsreel intercuts that the director thinks gives the film ""weight"". Gets two stars instead of one for a contribution to history of cinema. The real history of porno is a 1970s film called ""History of the Blue Movie"" which apparently was allowed to copy some early stuff from the Kinsey archives; this film was definitely available on VHS at one time, and is well-worth tracking down."
1,"I'm a Martha fan, but this book sucks","I'm a martha stewart fan, owning a lot of her books, but I'm turned off by the fact she had little to do with this book AND expects us to believe she actually slaved away to write it. Give me a break. Martha Stewart's 15 minutes of fame are up. Step aside."
3,Is it ompatible with your disc player?,"Prompt shipment. Was as represented, but before ordering, buyers need to be determine if CD-Rs will play on their disc players. My CEC-TL1 will not read or play it, so giving it to a friend."
5,Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts,"The DVD is great, a little pricey though, bought it as a christmas gift. I watched it, it is good."
1,DO the math,I purchased the clic readers here for $15.99 WHY are they $24.99 now? Too bad because it was a great product but I'll NEVER spend $24.99 for them!
5,clic,My husband use to go thru readers all the time. Break them lose them and forget where he put them. Now that these stay on all the time he has not lost a pair.
4,LONG CliC readers,I wear a 7-5/8 hat. The longs are adjustable. The legs slide in & out. The long CliCs are limited on color selection. They function well. I am on my 3rd pair. News flash! They never come off...!
1,Worked OK for 6 months...,"Worked OK for 6 months, then developed a constant hum / buzz in the right channel."
3,"Meh. Big speakers, not big sound.","They're okay for the price, but I also own the Logitech S120 2.0 that I got through Amazon for less than half the cost of these, and they sound just as good. These bigger ones come with a tone control, unlike the smaller ones, but frankly no matter what I do with the tone control they sound just as ""meh."" I'd suggest going with the smaller ones or upgrading to something better if you really want sound that you'd think should come from speakers this big (don't have them in front of me to measure, but they're probably about 9 inches tall and 3 inches wide."
5,Good cheap speakers,I thought they had very good sound for the price I paid. I think the people who gave it a bad review were expecting boss quality speakers for nothing.
3,Very annoying noise when turned on,somehow the one I get makes a high pitch noise whenever I turn on its power switch. It is generated by the power surge for sure and can catch people in surprise. This is annoying. But I am too lazy to return it since it otherwise works fine.
5,Excelent budget speakers!,These are great budget speakers. Can't beat the price. If you are looking for something cheap that still sounds decent these speakers are for you.
3,"They're not great, but they do the job","I bought these as a pair of speakers to sit on the side of my family-room computer. The sound isn't great, but they do the job. Don't expect the experience to resemble a concert from your computer, and you'll be fine."
5,Cheap and Cheerful!,"Great sound for the size/price. I needed a hotel companion for my ipod... These are perfect for the task. No, there won't be any bowel-shaking bass, or roaring parties...but that's not their task. Toss em in your luggage, and have some tunes when you arrive. Forget the gimmicky dock speakers, and spend your cash on the actual speakers, and not the dock, charging, remote etc.Good stuff. Compact. Decent sound. CHEAP!"
2,Not worth it.,It does not have decent Bass sound. It is cheap but it is better to get a better model because i don't find the sound very good. My laptop speakers sound better!
5,High Praise,"I am afraid I can only echo what others have said. For the money, these are the best speakers you can possibly have. Do they sound like Acoustic Research or Bose speakers - well, no. Did you really expect them to at $30?They are built tough, connect easily, and the power supply does not require an AC/DC brick. They are a bit large and consume desk space so if you are looking for compact speakers, you should look elsewhere. (Perhaps a setup with a floor mounted bass?) That being said, the sound is fine for internet cruising, simple games, and pop music.If your requirements include naturally aspirated instrument reproduction (jazz, symphony, opera) get out the wallet and buy some serious acoustical speakers. Other than that, these will be more than adequate for most needs. Once again people, they only cost $30!"
1,Looks can be deceiving!,"Please be aware...these speakers have an integrated power supply that is very susceptible to outside interference. I heard a constant buzz/hum from the left speaker (where the power supply is located) whenever the speakers were turned on.However, by looking at some of these other reviews, it does seem that others had a positive experience with the X-140s. So who knows...maybe I just got a lemon."
2,"Headphone hiss, short speaker wires and mediocre sound.","I have a pretty specific list of requirements for desktop speakers. My work computer has a broken headphone jack in the front, so i have to use the one in the back. These were to double as an extension cord for my headphones. Also I have four monitors, from the left to right monitor it's about 3.5 feet. I need the speakers to reach from that distance. Finally, i'm no audiofile, but I like the speakers to sound ok.These do none of those.- The speaker cable between the left and right modules is bout 2 feet, to short to go on both sides of my monitors.- The headphone jack has a constant hiss coming out of it.- The sound quality is pretty sub par.- Also they are quite large, I could possibly fit them under my monitors if they were less then 4"" high, but they are more like 7"" high."
5,Great Speakers!,"These speakers have solid construction and great sound quality. Being able to directly plug my headphones into the speakers is really helpful, since my computer tower's headphone jack doesn't work. I am surprised that such good speakers aren't very expensive!"
4,Great buy,"Bought these speakers mainly because they have the dials right on the front. The sound is really good and for the price, it's a great value."
4,pleased with purchase...but,The speakers seem to be working great thus far. The set up was a breeze and the quality of sound is nice. My only issue with these is the size. Perhaps I didn't read the specs closely enough but they are rather large next to my desktop. I would prefer they be about 1/2 the size...
3,Speakers,"Was not able to use, as they had the wrong plug on it for the UK. Was not able to send back as it would cost more, than I bought then for."
2,Should be free....,"I'll not say much other than everyone who is giving these 4 & 5 stars must have VERY low expectations. I realize these are cheap speakers, but most the free speakers I've had over the years with computer I've bought are better than these.- Tinney: like a drain pipe- NO bass: yes there is a Bass response, similar to thumping on a scratchy balloon.These are fine for very low volume use."
5,Excellent for the price,"If I want high end audio I connect through my integrated amp and floor standing speakers, but at times I just want to surf the web and have decent audio at my computer. These fit the bill perfectly. For the small change these speakers are very impressive. Sound is clear and they provide a good amount of bass. I can get plenty of volume without distortion. Sturdy build quality and it's nice they use a standard AC plug.I've gone through many 2.0 PC speakers in this price range and the Logitech X-140 2.0 Speakers are by far the best I have found. Heads above others in this price range. Highly recommended..."
5,Great Little Speakers,These little speakers work great. I hooked them up to my Ipod docking station and we use them outside at our pool. They are perfect for this!!
5,Great sound at a low price,"I purchased these because the Haier TV that we purchased for our kitchen doesn't have the best sound, as is the case with many flat-screen TVs. These speakers have a good amplifier and very clear sound. I turned the bass almost all the way down and they still sound very good."
1,Lightning Deal Not Such a Great Deal After All,"Ordered these speakers at the end of November 2010 because they were offered on Amazon's Lightning Deal Promotion at $14.99 I needed a cheap set of speakers for an older computer that has been relocated to the guest room. I was not looking for the best sound quality; just something that would deliver sound/ music, simple with no frills. The speakers have only been used about 10 or 12 times, and one speaker just died last week. I would like to blame the blow-out on excessive audio levels, but that was not the case. One speaker just died for no obvious reason - end of story. I would suggest that anyone looking for a cheap set of speakers go with another brand. I would gladly return these to Amazon, but the product fizzled well after the return window, which expired on Jan. 31, 2011."
3,Speakers,"I bought them to go with a new television and they would not hook up to it so I sent them back. Otherwise, I thought they were very well constructed and would have loved to have kept them."
5,"Very good speakers, very little bass","If you are looking for a set of speakers that have a good range and do not have a ""subwoofer"", these are a great buy. Of course, you shouldn't expect great bass from them because, let's face it, there is only so much three inch drivers with three inch passive radiators can realistically do. However, considering their construction, they do fairly well. One nice feature is the built in power supply -- no wall wart. Also, they are fairly heavy and larger than I expected (that's not a minus). You can get a different set of speakers with a subwoofer (well, that's what they'll call it) that will give you more dynamic range for about the same price, but then you have to deal with the subwoofer, the extra wires, etc. Logitech rarely disappoints."
4,logitech speakers,This is a ok product for the price. A little hollow but ok until I can afford to upgrade. It is nice that I can turn the speakers off from the speakers themselves.
4,Very good speakers for the price,The external speakers make a world of difference in playing music and watching movies. They are a little bigger than I expected but are attractive. I only wish they came with a USB connetion. Overall: Worth the price.
5,Well built speakers,"These are solid speakers. Good quality, and decent sound. Sure they are not BOSE but they also don't have the big price tag. I had mine for over three years and they still work perfectly since the day i bought them."
1,Died after 3 years,Forget it! These speakers are not worth it... completely died after 3 years as it dwindled down to a stop. Now need to go buy more speakers. I watch a lot of netflix on my large screen computer...
5,Love Em,"Didn't want to have a sub-woofer, but wanted a decent pair of speakers for PC output. These really do the trick for the right price. Very happy with this purchase."
3,Great for the price,"As much as I would like to rate these higher, I just can't bring myself to give them above 3 stars. They are good speakers for the price, but I wish they were great speakers for the price. Logitech always produces great products, but this one is just good. My main gripes are that they sound a bit tinny and there is almost no bass to speak of with these. I think they could have done better, but I'm still satisfied with mine."
4,really good bargain,"I mean they are not top end perfect stereo sound system for a disco kind of great. . . .but they work fantastic for streaming video, music, and day to day on my system. I was actually really amazed at the depth of sound. They are a great value for the money."
2,Disappointing,"I'm surprised at all the positive reviews, but I guess different strokes for different folks. I think these things sound awful...not enough low end, very ""middy"" and hollow for my ears, very boring, lifeless sound. I'm shopping for something new."
4,Pretty good speakers. :),I ordered these speakers just for browsing the internet and playing some music. They meet my needs and are actually pretty loud. They were kinda poppin or crackling a little at first but i haven't noticed it in a while so maybe they quit for good i hope. Overall i am happy with my purchase.
5,Well made,"What can you say, they are good speakers. Good mids, highs and bass is not bad either. I love that it has both an output and input on the speakers, very convenient if you do not want to unplug what it is already plugged into in order to play from an mp3 player."
3,Very contradictory information,"The author uncovers a nugget of information (infanticide) then quickly pulls it back from view (kinder and gentler, household servants, etc.) for pages and pages. These contradictions happen again and again.Another frustration with this work is that the quotes from the Koran (of which I only saw one) are not in the notes and other Koranic references are paraphrased. A very big oversight in my mind since he mentions that justification for slavery can be found in the Koran. He may be right but he doesn't present any evidence. Need chapter and verse.I agree that this is an important work because it is one of the first. The contradictions are frustrating, though."
4,A good hard disk drive,I have owned this disk drive for about 3 month and is working perfectly.It is very fast and quit.I'm thinking about buying another one.
3,puppet,The puppet says 14 in but it was skinny and didn't match the others in size. Folkmanis is the puppets they love the most but for some reason not this one. My grsndkids like the animals one in this line the best.
2,It can be 4 stars if the author makes all of my recommendations,"This book is easy to follow in general although there are several places where the writing is hard to follow. I enjoyed the way Durrett introduced a new topic to the readers. The examples are helpful; however, some of exercises seem to be a bit more difficult than the examples provided. There are two recommendations about this book. (1) correct typos. I located more than 10-15 places to be corrected after Durrett published his corrections on his web-site. (2) discuss more about Brownian Motion. Durrett rushed through the chapter and I found it to be hard to do the exercises in that chapter."
1,Thai language book and 2 tapes,"The Moore and Rodchue COLLOQUIAL THAI and the accompanying 2 cassette tapes from Routledge are not all they are cracked up to be. Main gripe...one can not use the tapes without having the book in hand at the same time...so no use of tapes in the automobile. Also, neither the tapes nor the book are clear about where in the book the tape is referencing and vice versa. Also, no repetition on the tapes and u know how difficult it is to rewind a tape an inch to repeat a word or phrase. If a person learns Thai from this book/tape set, they really should go into the language business because the set presents very difficult usage challenges and is not educationally sound...that comes from a 30 year educator...me. Get a computer CD ROM set instead or get a native Thai to speak to your own cassette this way...1.Thai word three times, 2.English word twice, and again the same Thai word three times...then go to the next word. Sad product as it stands..."
5,"Big warm beanie, and cheap too!","This beanie is very big. You can wear it folded or not, and both ways are nice and warm. I've been told I look like a robber or a bum, but I suppose thats how it goes for black beanies."
4,Shirley,"This Temple film is very good. Little Shirley stars as the ""daughter"" of a lighthouse keeper who rescued her when she was a baby. A truant officer learns that ""Star"" doesn't go to school, makes her take an examination, and when she passes, angrily decides to sent Star to an institution. Unhappy Star gets a surprise from her sympathizing aunt and uncle. Includes lots of dancing. Not too cute like some of the Temple films. Lots of songs."
4,Good movie,"John Singleton is one of my favorite directors. I thought this was a well done film. I know alot of caucasian people think this portrays them in a bad way but it's not the whole race. It's shows how some people think and that's true. Lets be honest, there are still some nazi out there. When a college student doesn't fit in, he finds a group of neo nazies that excepts him. That's everyday life. The acting was good and this was a strong college drama for it's time."
4,Well made film,"The characters are really nothing you haven't seen before in other movies, but in this movie, they work well together. The film shows the changes of 3 college freshmen during their first year away from home. The supporting cast around the 3 main players add great depth to the script. While I didn't go to college until after I had completed military service, the things I see in the film I see, to some extent, in the students I now go to class with. Great film."
4,College 101,"I believe that Higher Learning is a video that should be viewed by all college students. John Singleton does an exceptional job of describing college life in today's society. In today's colleges and universities the situations are not as blatent as in the movie, but the mental struggle that students encounter are very true. Higher Learning touches down on many aspects of the problems that all Americans endure on an everyday basis. I believe without a doubt that this movie should be a prerequisite for all entering college students!"
1,such a stupid movie,"This movie is just so over dramatic. Thank god my college experience was nothing like they portray in this movie. The whole movie just feels so forced and fictional. The black characters are made to look like they're so cool and that they are still prisoners living in the ""white mans country"". Its ridiculous that people still think like today. This movie is just making people dumber and misinformed. I also hated how the white cops are shown to be so racist against blacks. Seriously john singleton?? You really seem to think that all whites hate blacks and that black people should never ever get over slavery and should instead keep on resenting the man."
2,Movie of stereotypes,"All this movie is, is a series of stereotypes of various groups of people : school-shooting secretly woussy neonazi, athletic angry black guy, oversensitive feminist hippie chick, wise all-knowing professor. Really the only good part of the movie is the last part. If you filtered out the entire movie down to just the lines from Lawrence Fishburne, you'd have something of value."
5,Excellent music!,"Being a long time fan of Chucks, I had to have this when I heard the collaboration that he and Cissy Houston did. I'm from the old school where music was music! Lyrics were meaningful because they told a story! Cissy sounds absolutely great on here, and Chucks baritone, always easy on the ear, is still in form! However, I must say that my favorite song of Cissy's on here is, ""Why Do You Turn Away"". Then again, I have to include Chuck's all time stand by, ""I Don't Want To Cry"", which was his #1 hit back in the 60's. I'd highly recommend this to anyone because it's really nice!"
4,Fine for its particular audience,"The 'Testimonial dinner' set of covers is smart, well produced, and interesting to people who know the XTC material already. Except Ruben Blades's brilliant rework, most people will find that the artists' original recordings of their own music is fulfilling and that XTC did a sporting job at recording their own work. That is, XTC didn't need the testimonial.Nonetheless, it's sound listening. The common complaint is that neither Partridge nor Colin Moulding have the voice to carry their songs. If that's so, you will like this varied album."
4,it doesn't slip!,"Good:nice large surfaceworks well with our optical mouse for gaminglooks really good on our deskand the biggest improvement for us... it is heavy and has a soft rubber bottom that doesn't sliBad:one MINOR annoyance... the metal trim on the lower part is about 1 1/2 in wide and in our basement in the winter is pretty cold on the wrist. OK, I admit that is pretty minor, but I find myself pulling my sleeve down onto the heel of my hand to keep it warm. We'll probably appreciate this ""feature"" in the heat of summer!"
1,Not recommended.,"I've been using this pad for about 10 months now and I must say I'm very dissappointed.1) The pad gets sticky VERY easily. I have to clean the pad every 2-3 days because it gets sticky and creates friction.(Not a good thing for gamers)2) The paint on the metalic part(where my palm touches) started coming off after 2-3 months of usage.3) The place where paint came off is now collecting rust. Whenever I use the pad for decent amount of time, I'd get rust on my hands.I'm tossing it out as soon as my new pad arrives."
1,1 out of 3,For some reason only one out of the 3 i bought worked on my optical mice. this was testing on three different brands of mouse with the same results. I have had good experiences int he past with this product which is why I bought 3. I don't believe i will try them again. Going to find another brand of hard mouse pads.
4,Clock Works,"Despite the fact that this clock hangs in my basement rec room in Cincinnati, it has had no problem receiving the time signal from Colorado. It should be noted, though, that, as the manual mentions, the proximity of a powered-up TV or computer monitor can interfere with reception of the signal.As an owner of some expensive acoustic guitars, I find the hydrometer readout very useful for monitoring room humidity. And the readout is big enough to be easily visible from across the room.I only wish this thing looked a little less purely utilitarian. Big and clunky, two-tone silver, it adds nothing to my room aesthetically."
4,Intelligently crafted,"As an amateur DJ for a community radio station, I stumbled upon this CD (well, more like requested it) and have been quite pleased. Yes, it's a CD compiled of songs that are inspired by famous poems or, alternatively, there are musical versions of the original poems themselves. Although there are moments when her song doesn't quite do the original justice, there are also moments when she nails it better than its original author. I particularly enjoyed the upbeat Galuppi Baldessare, the heart-breaking Sence You Went Away and The Drop and the Dream. For literary folks out there, I believe you'll find this to be a grand treat. The original poems included in the CD booklet are a nice compliment to the songs themselves. It's an intelligent and thought-provoking album with a wide range of music styles."
1,never wore,they didnt stick and just looked way too fake!! my husband swore it was chicken and it just makes u that much more self consious.
4,They worked just like I thought they would!,"They worked just like I thought they would. I wasn't blessed with full breasts, and these are really helping! They fill in my bras and now I actually feel comfortable wearing my shirts that are kind of tight around the breast area. :) They feel good. The only bad thing with them is you can feel yourself wearing them. But it just feels like I'm wearing a padded bra or something. I like them!"
4,takes me back to the late 1970s!!!!!,just as I remembered the old songs. so glad its still around and available for our listening enjoyment
1,Lasted about a month,"The battery in this lasted about a month, and the dial is hard to read, terrible.Would not buy from Kenneth Cole again."
2,Found to be inferior,"Have found the bandsaw blade to be inferior, have broken several despite adjustments to tension and tracking adjustments, the weld is weak."
2,NOT so happy with it!,"My 6 month old kept getting hurt with this toy. First the seat has no cushion at all and my child kept leaning forward in the seat. Then she kept hitting her eye on the microphone. On the record player the arm that you pull down to play the record her finger kept getting stuck between the arm and the record, and she would also pinch her finger on the page that you turn on the book. She doesn't even like to see the toy she is so terrified of it. This toy is all ready to go back to the store."
2,NOT SAFE FOR LITTLE FINGERS,MY SON IS NOW 5 MONTHS OLD. HE HAS BEEN USING THIS TOY FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT!! HE WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN THE LIGHTS AND MUSIC AT FIRST (AND STILL IS). NOW HE'S STARTING TO PLAY WITH EVERYTHING. HE WAS PLAYING WITH THE RECORD PLAYER AND GOT HIS FINGERS STUCK. THAT IS THE ONLY DEFECT I HAVE FOUND BUT I THINK IT'S A PRETTY MAJOR ONE. I STILL LET HIM PLAY IN IT BUT I HAVE TO BE RIGHT THERE TO TURN HIM AWAY FROM THAT PART. IT'S A SHAME BECAUSE THAT IS HIS FAVORITE PART OF THE TOY.
3,Helpful information but on the verge of being dated,"This book is a mix of useful and dated information. Useful are the profiles of others who have broken into the business and the section on hardware and tools. The book has a 1995 publication date so the section on software comes under the ""dated"" heading. Windows 3.1 and DOS coverage are virtually useless. And don't bother to look for Internet sources-they are not there. To sum up, as long as the reader is willing to ignore the out of date items he may be able to get some use out of this title. Otherwise, wait for an update."
2,Not interesting at all,"The book I feel was a waste of money. The authors just re-hashed what a person of average intelligence would do if they were to go into business. If you have no clue about computers and something posessed you to go into a computer business, then this book is for you."
2,Uncertain about its accuracy,"The scale looks nice and the step on feature is cool. However, no matter what I do, it almost gives me exactly the same weight. I can be wearing 3 pound jeans and then take them off but still see the same weight on the scale. I don't know what this means but I feel like the scale will just never report subtle changes in weight to me"
2,can't trust it,"depending upon the surface you place it on, you will get different weights.Sometimes, it does not work.Sometimes, it will display different weights when it has not been moved.I can not tell if I actually weigh what it says so it is useless."
4,A book I greatly enjoyed,"76. Shipmates, by Mary T. Waggaman (read in 1940) This is the sixth of the twelve books I read by this author, whose work I really liked. On page 1179 of The Guide to Catholic Literature 1888-1940 it shows the book was published in 1914 by Benziger, with the sale price being 60 cents. A note on that page says: ""A chaming story, mostly of boys. Catholic atmosphere. (Cath. World 100:841 Mar 1915) (America 12:128 Nov 14, 1914)"
5,Great Book! Easy to read and easy to follow!,"This a great book on investing in income producing real estate. It focuses on three areas of why real estate investing makes sense:a) cash flow from annually increasing rentsb) tax savings through depreciation of the property andc) equity gain by the renter paying down the loan.No other real estate books I have read have explained these concepts this thoroughly (and believe me I have read a lot of r.e. books!) with real world examples and hard numbers.This book is not about get-rich quick schemes. We've all seen these claims: ""Quit your job in 2 months!"", ""Buy homes with no money down!"", etc.If you are looking for something like that, try a different book. This book is about growing wealth over time. Just like the title says ""Income for Life""..."
5,GREAT INVESTMENT BOOK,You either get it or you don't! This book is about investing not becoming a landlord. Al's strategies are based on facts and the ability to follow a disciplined plan. This book is not a get rich quick scheme but is based on sound and conservative investment strategies. Al demystifies the many negative stereotypes of investment properties and puts forth a simple yet effective investment strategy. I have read numerous books on Income properties and Al Lee has the best system I have seen for growing your net worth and securing a retirement. If that is something you are interested in then this book is for you.
3,"This is a fun book for Fourth,Fifth and Sixth graders","I have just used this book for the first time this week and the upper graders and teachers loved it. I am a storyreader who travels to many schools reading my favorite books. Barbara Parks is one of my favorite authors be cause of her use of language that kids can relate to, and they can surely relate to the humor in Bogeyman! Jim McKenna, STORYREADER"
2,It was BORING,"This had to have been the dullest book I have ever read. I waited through out the whole novel for something to happen! All it consisted of was some man leading a boring life. Yeah I know it was called SEIZE THE DAY but really, do we need to be put through the agony of hearing of someone else's continuous problems that were all self inflicted?"
4,A deep psychological work,"This is a story about relationships and alienation. It is a psychological work by Bellow, getting in the head of a man coming to grips with his mid-life failures. It also shows his relationships with a tough love (or just tough?) father, and manipulative friends. As you read it, you struggle between repulsion, sympathy and identification with the lead character.The book is very accessible and easy to read given the intellectual pedigree of the author. Even still, one is left at the end wondering, ""What did I miss?"" While the reader may be left perplexed, it is a sign of the depth of material pushed into such a short novel.I'm left thinking, ""It's a good, deep book"" - perhaps a more in tune reader would find it a great one."
3,A Great American Read,"This is one of Bellow's finest short works of fiction. A lot of his later short novels are spotty at best, but this earlier one captures an American spirit that is fun to behold."
4,Pathetic Tendency Made Funny,"A middle-aged man at his wit's end; his past, present, and future seem bleak. Mr. Bellow wrote with ease and humor about such a man. Although the character is in his forties and has barely jumped over one hurdle after another throughout his whole life due to his own naivety, he continues to make more mistakes than ever. The story takes place only in one day. In about 115 pages the reader finds out what makes the man he is. It is also up to the reader to conclude Mr. Bellow's account of this man. Mr. Bellow's writing was fluent where he detailed each appearance and action thoroughly with a very good sense of humor. It is a fast and interesting read."
3,carpe diem!,"Just kidding with my tittle. I can't help but connect Robin Williams and co. jumping off of desks in Dead Poet's Society to the phrase Carpe Diem/ Seize The Day. (I know, Saul Bellow wrote this book before Mr.Williams was even born!)I thought this book had a great start. I loved the characterizations in the first half, I felt I was really getting into it. Sadly, by the second half, I found the book a bit tedious and unsatisfying. The doctor character was just plain annoying, and although that very well may have been the point, it was irritating reading about him."
4,Carpe Diem,"It is true, that on the exterior this book seems to be a great bore. We are subject to the lead characters complaining throughout the story, and the whole time we want to shout at him to grow up. It can be very frustrating and stirs up hostility towards the character. Which is a wonderful achievement by a book. The book is very good because it actually does stir up emotion. Most of all, it makes a major statement about the human condition in America. How many of us know people like Tommy Wilhelm? Read it and you'll find that you know plenty."
2,Why am I still an Idiot?,"I bought this book in hopes that I would be playing the piano as soon as I began reading the book. This did not happen. The first seven chapters were getting me familar with the piano world -good but not at this point in my learning. I also found I didn't need the wit or the side bars. All I was looking for when I bought the book was a logical step-by-step method of playing the piano. The books' material is good but not for me, and that is why I feel I am still an Idiot."
5,Simply Outstanding,"This CD holds a quintet of amazing tracks by a trio of amazing musicians. Perhaps even more amazingly, the songs are so varied that you may be surprised they came from the same group. Splashdown is a real treat!"
5,This is how Music SHOULD Sound,"Words cannot describe the utter beauty of the phenomenon known as Splashdown and the sheer genius behind it. More than music, this is an experience. A delight for all the senses. Well worth the price, if you can find it."
3,George Gilder has it less than half right...,"George Gilder is, in general, correct about what he writes in 'Men and Marriage'. That being said, his book places all of the focus upon the standards of the woman. The apostle Paul, in Ephesians 5:22-33, however, calls upon a man to intentionally and unconditionally love his wife in four ways: 1) sacrificially, 2) with a sanctifying love, 3) a caring love, and 4) a bonded love. Given theres truths, the man is to intentionally and unconditonally love his wife in the four ways conveyed in Scripture. The role of the wife is responsive, the man leading."
2,Weird book,"While I agree with Gilder that a return to marriage and family is nothing but positive for society, I absolutely disagree with returning to traditional gender roles unless that is what each person wants. Live and let live. I have a wonderful egalitarian marriage that serves my family quite well. Both of us work and could each support our family should anything happen to the other which is something that my stay at home sister going through a divorce will never be able to do for herself and her children. If a traditional marriage with traditional roles works for you, great. If an egalitarian one works - good for you too. Men should be offended that Gilder reduces them to violent, drooling troglodyte rapists if they aren't married and in control. I don't know any single guys that fit that bill outside of prison."
1,A disappointment,"This book is billed as the sequel to ""The Second Kiss,"" but it will be a great disappointment to fans of that novel. Simply a laundry list of inventions and events, the actual story within this novel is a mere outline. The narrative of the two lovers meeting in another lifetime takes up perhaps 10 pages. The title character, Glaydce, is completely unappealing. A sequel was a nice idea but this simply does not work."
5,very compelling,"My husband and I really enjoyed this movie. The movie Red Tails was showing at the theatre, but all the reviewers said this version was much better. It is an excellent movie."
5,Great Movie,This is an exciting and pretty historically accurate story of the Tuskeegee Airmen. It accurately shows the blatent and universal bigotry of the period as well as the ability of some Blacks to rise above it. Highly recommended for high school students interested in getting a jump start on a really cool term paper. -Dennis in Richmond.
4,Good movie,Good 'ole fashion movie right here. I remember watching this on TV all the time. Simply a classic and a must see.
2,Brave men poorly presented,"I am knowledgeable from other written materials concerning the plight of these men. The producer ignored any of the issues other than race relations. They were there, and we all know it. Getting through flight school was a major hurtle due to the army instructor's prejudice; but, these men overcame that issue and the face of death in Europe. I was personally disappointed and resented the shallow ""hollywoodized"" version. These men were deeply challenged on two fronts and to me heros to be admired and to which all Americans owe tribute. Find their story somewhere else. You can have mine. Finally, let me restate, just getting to EAO took tremendous bravery."
3,Tuskegee Airmen,The movie was ok. I am not sure how much of it is fact or fiction or Hollywood. It did make me interested in reading up on the subject.
1,Same Movie?,"The bluray edition shows an entirely different cast other than Fishburne and is eight(8) minutes shorter. Is this the same movie as the 1995 release or is it a remake? The original movie was great and worth a five star rating, based upon the information given for this edition of the movie I will give it one star and purchase the standard DVD edition."
3,"good acting and story, poor and inaccurate action scenes","As a WW2 plane buff, I will just comment on air combat and planes.The movie tries but fails not to be a black Top Gun. This means when Lawrence Fishburne arrives, Jerries get shot down. He doesn't stop at planes, he manages to sink a warship with his 6 .50 cals (!).German planes are Spanish used 109s, sporting Rolls Royce engines. In the time of modern special effects, some FW 190s and correct Me 109s are a must. Same for P 51s. We are led to believe that Tuskegee airmen only later switched to P51, the D version. They, however, fly the same type throughout whole movie.German pilots are portrayed as flying idiots, despite their real record will never be matched (over hundred aces with over 100 kills, 2 aces with over 300 kills). In the movie, however, they need 4:1 to make an aerial kill and are quickly chased away by our hero Fishbourne.A nice story, good acting, but definitely dissapointing air combat scenes."
5,Excellent film,"This film depicts a mostly forgotten part of American history. Following the cadets from wannabe Army-Air Corps pilots through training (and some failures) through to their unmatched conduct in WW II is must viewing for all Americans. The racism is a lesson for all, both in the stupidity of its existence (Negroes aren't smart enough or talented enough to fly complex airplanes) to what can be productively accomplished when it is not used as an excuse for quitting. The famous ""Red Tails"" never lost a B-17 to enemy fighters and they were not a welcome sight to Luftwaffe pilots. More persistent than their white counterparts, the B-17 crews came to ask for their unit specifically to fly escort.The film captures all of this. Andre Braugher is outstanding as Benjamin O. Davis. Courtney B. Vance is excellent as the liaison Lt. Glenn. Laurence Fishburne's composite character (including that of of the person Charles Alfred Anderson) is superb.Worth buying and watching repeatedly"
4,The Tuskegee Airmen,My family and I watched this movie some time ago and enjoyed the action and history being it was based on a true story. We were delighted that you were selling this item and now can watch at our leisure. Thank you again.
4,The Tuskegee Airmen,I thought this movie was very well done and my hart goes out to those brave young men for all they did to over come what they were put through. Those who could treat another airmen like these men were treated may they pray for forgivness.
5,HIGHLY recommended,Highly recommended harp music....so relaxing and I am listening it every time I am frustrated.I also bought the Harp of the Healing Light from Apple iTune.
1,Lots of prog moves but vocalist is horrible,"Three things here:1) The music is not half-bad prog metal with decent keys and somewhat lacking guitar work.2) Compositionally, there's too much going on. These guys want to be considered prog so badly, they do not know when to can the scale/tempo changes in favor of memorable melodies.3) Vocal lines are very limited, largely due to the vocalist's severe lack of talent. This guy has a below average voice and can't hit a note at point blank with double-barreled shotgun. Simply terrible.Summary: Try again guys and get rid of the crappy singer. If the talent pool in Hungary is that dry, just put out instrumental albums."
5,Heart 2 Heart Connections: Miracles All Around Us,"This book has a profound effect on the reader with the messages that are contained inside it. People have often commented, ""How did you write about my life?"" I still re-read the words in the book and find new insights and guidance relevant right now in my life. This book is for those who are ready to move forward in spiritual enlightenment and acknowledge that God is truly limitless, surprising in the ways we are just beginning to understand. It is written in Spirit and Truth and will touch your heart with the miracles that are truly all around us."
3,this CD had so back round noise on remastering,"this CD has some back round noise on ermastering but good in use for the car, only hear it if up turn the sound up to high, ( can not rock out with this one):"
1,Outmoded thinking - behind the times,"Dreyfus' understanding of distance learning is quite limited. On page 39 of this book he defines distance learning as ""the correspondence-course model of anonymous information consumers."" Distance learning has a lot more going for it than that, I have found that there is a lot of interactivity in online courses and a high level of communication with the professors. I took one of Dreyfus' classes at Berkeley as an undergraduate and I never got to talk to him, there was no face to face learning. If you feel that the lecture method is the only way to learn, then the internet is not for you. If you want to feel like a ""disembodied presence"" go take a class at Berkeley as an undergrad."
2,Disappointing and overpriced,"Tanita BC-534 (BC534) Tanita InnerScan Body Fat Composition ScaleBought this scale thinking it was the next best thing to a dunk tank. Guess again. My body fat varied about 5 percent, even though I weighed the same time of day. After about three months, the fat scan part quit--only the weight worked. Now, approx. 1 year after purchase, all we get is an ""Error"" sign. Changing batteries didn't help. It's a $100 white elephant."
2,Not good enough,"I have urgently replaced this base (suppose to be mobile base) by HTC2000. Absolutely no contest. Wheels are too small to keep equipment parallel to the floor surface. In addition, it is not as sturdy as HTC2000; is more expensive and is more cumbersome."
3,Works great after assembled but...,"I have to say that this product works great now that I have it all put together. I'm giving this product three stars for two reasons. One is that it was missing the leveling feet. Not a big deal since I can still use the thing while I'm waiting for the missing pieces from Delta. Based on other reviews, missing parts seems to be a conistent problem with this product. The other bigger issue I had was size requirements. I bought this for my jointer which has a base that's 12.5""x17.5"". Unfortunately, the minimum width (the dimension where the foot lever resides) for the mobile base is 16"" and nowhere in the documentation or on the box does it say anything about minimum size requirements. I had the wood cut and ready to assemble when I realized this."
5,It works,"I bought one of these to hold about 350 lbs of Parks planner, base and motor. It rolls around my shop easily. I used square metal tubing instead of wood, by the way. If you have a good surplus store nearby, it's a lot cheaper, I had the lengths precut and all I had to do was drill, sand and paint. Be sure you read the directions carefully before cutting the lengths of your rails. It shipped short of the two adjustable feet that it rests on, but a phone call to Delta and I had them in 2 days."
3,Drill Press Base,"Easy to assemble if you have hard wood available. I had maple and a drill press. The only complaint is that I have a drill press base that is 13"" wide and the minimum width of this product is 15 1/2""."
4,Good bye dust,Two of my children and husband have dust allergies. This filter seems to work well at reducing the problem.
4,The Darlene Love cuts are worth the price of admission alone.,"Both are fine singers, but Darlene Love singing I'll be There and Let it Be will send chills down your spine. She is one of the most underrated singers around. Loni Groves does a fine Getting Used and Turn Back the Hands of Time, and their harmonies are good. I would love for Darlene Love to get back in the recording studio."
4,Good historical narrative,My comment for Volume II are the same as Volume III. These volumes are for serious students of history. I would also recommend reading Volume I.
1,not our favorite,"We recently purchased seven unsweetened chocolate bars for comparison. The goal was to find an unsweetened chocolate that was so good (to snack on) that it didn't need sugar. It does exist: Pralus French 100% Cocoa: Criollo Chocolate. The Schaffen Berger Unsweetened 99% Cacao Baking Chocolate Bar came in last. Our rankings (which of course reflect out personal tastes) from love to freecycle: 1. Pralus French 100% Cocoa: Criollo Chocolate; 2. Vintage Plantations 100% Cacao Arriba Bar; 3. Michel Cluizel French Chocolate - ""Chocolat Noir Infini"" 99% Cocoa Dark Chocolate (has more ingredients added); 4. Sunspire 100% Chocolate Bar; and it was difficult to rank the last three as we did not care for them at all - 5. Ghirardeli 100% unsweeteed Chocolate Bar; 6. Callebaut Unsweetened Liquor Chunks Cocoa; 7. Schaffen Berger Unsweetened 99% Cacao Baking Chocolate Bar."
4,He's BAAAAAAACK!,"I'm surprised to see the number of bad reviews of this latest King novel. No, it's not The Stand, but folks, nothing ever will be. And it's not quite like anything King has written to date... but not far off the mark. Yes, it IS a love story; but it's also pure, fantastic King at his finest with the other-world-ness. The ""made up words"" didn't distract me at all. Go with the flow, folks. Strap it on, as they say. I'm very confused by the review indicating ""he hates the prez"" - how strange. A reviewer really sensitive about the subject i guess; it was one line from one character. Who cares?? Nope; not his best, but definitely another great read from The King. This will stay in my library."
1,"This one's a sleeper, not a keeper.. ...zzzzzzzzz...","As a Stephen King fan, I kept reading and hoping that this story would get interesting... I gave up at page 100. The story is slow, unrealistic, and sappy. It never works for me when a male author writes from a woman's point of view. I can buy that a woman would mourn for 2 yrs for her husband after his death, but not that she's so disoriented, can't keep a thought in her head, and has gone stupid. For 100 pages, that's the gist of the story. Very, very disappointed in Stephen King this time. This one was a sleeper for me... zzzzzzzzz....."
2,Could not keep reading,"Maybe it's just part of getting older, but I just couldn't take the gore in this book. I had to stop reading after Lisey's first face-to-face encounter with ""McCool."" I have been a Stephen King fan for years, but I just kept thinking that there were so many better ways I could be spending my time."
3,Not my cup of tea...,"I am a King fan but I felt the writing in this book was uneven. Part of the reason I am such a big fan is because I usually really like King's characters and find myself rooting for them even when they do things I don't like but I did not like Lisey until over halfway into the book. Also, the fantasy sequences were uninteresting and far too drawn out."
2,A Sad Misstep for King,"I clawed my way to the end of this book, but it was tough going. King, who possesses a genuine literary talent that he didn't use consistently for years, has more recently attempted to write in a more ""literary"" fashion, but his prose (and particularly his penchant for long interior monologues) have begun to overwhelm his narratives. There is no reason why a strong horror plot and inventive, sensitive prose cannot co-exist -- King has proven that they can -- but a careful balance is necessary. ""Lisey's Story"" doesn't achieve that balance. The plot, such as it is, is weak and obscured by the effects, which largely seem to exist for their own sake rather than to explicate story and character.The book is a love story intersecting with a horrific personal history, and Lisey herself is an appealing heroine, but not enough to overcome the many problems. Reluctantly not recommended."
2,Yawn.....,"Every Stephen King book (with the exception of this one) has turned me into a crack junkie of reading. I carried his books where-ever I went and read while hiding the books beneath my desk, inserted in the hymninals at church, on the bus bench, while waiting for dentists to stick tools in my mouth, etc. This is the ONLY one that I had to force myself to finish! About mid-way through the book I realized that it really wasn't going to get any better and that I truly, truly hated whiney, little Lisey. I felt that I owed King the courtesy of finishing the book in respect for all his others that gave me such pleasure. I only got through it by rooting for the bad guys to get Lisey and kill her in some horrible, boolish way."
2,"How to squeeze 30 pages of plot, in the first 300 pages of a book.","I am a Steven King fan, but even by his standards, this book starts out real slow. I had a hard time not putting this book down until I got through the slow moving, and far too chatty first half of the book. The last half of of the book was better (although not great), but by the time I got to it, I was pretty much soured on the book as a whole. If I knew what I know now, I would have never bought the book in the first place."
3,A VERY slow start ... but it does get better!,"If you can get through the first fifty-or-so pages of this book, it will be worth your time. I no longer waste my time reading boring or hard-to-read books, but based on the great stories in Stephen King's past work, I thought I'd take a chance. Glad I did - after the first few chapters filled with REALLY annoying baby talk, the story picked up and became a vintage Stephen King otherwordly joyride."
5,Lisey's Story,"Ooooh Mr. King! Or as Bob Cratchett said, ""Another triumph, my dear."" I admit to being highly biased about Stephen King works - it's my opinion that Stephen King is the foremost great author in America (heck, maybe the world!). To the story.Poor Lisey loses her husband - a famous author. Then Lisey's faced with some bad problems: crazy sister; demented fan; cleaning her dead husband's office. None of which seem resolvable. Until she ""goes to the pool"" - her husband's wellspring of sanity.I've heard/read that this work is sort of autobiographical. Man, if it is, I wanna go to the pool too! Great work - worth a good reading from anyone, especially King fans."
2,not up to par,"I am a big Stephen King fan, and have been reading his stuff (sometimes over and over again) for over 30 years. I am listening to this one, and I have to say that I agree that the cutsie-pie language is incredibly annoying. It is so repetitive and annoying that it takes away from the story. It makes it difficult to get through and prevents me from caring at all about the characters. It is very disappointing and all i want to do is yell ""Shut up!"" I'm plowing through it because it is mildly interesting. Definitely will not read this one again..."
4,"King hits all three: horror, fantasy, and love","I have been a King reader for a long while. I am a serious fan of the Dark Tower series and look forward to his next walk into an epic series. In the mean time I satiate myself with his single works. To my joy, I found Lisey's Story to be a wonderful microcosm of what, was to me, so powerful in the Dark Tower Series - a perfect combination of horror, fantasy, and love. Not since the relationship of Rolland and Susan Delgado from the Wizard and Glass has King created such a powerful story of mature love, enveloped in a fascinating web of engrossing fantasy and gut wrenching horror. Playing, as he so often does, with horror as seen through the eyes of the young and vulnerable, King weaves a tail that wont let you put the book down for more than evening, and will keep you dreading the final page. Which, by the way, was not rushed; rather extra time and care was taken to adequately reflect and properly finish the tale. Well-done Mr. King."
3,"Stephen Strapped it on, but Smucked it up","The title of this review indicates my first (and worst) problem with ""Lisey's Story"": the constant repetition of phrases the Landon's used in the ""private language of marriage."" (The fact that many such expressions seem to have come from his bad ole daddy doesn't seem to have kept Scott Landon from using them ad nauseum.) More important, the book is boring. A thriller should not be dull. It can (and should) have lulls, of course, so the next time someone jumps out and yells ""Boo!"" the reader is startled, but here, the novel comes to a dead halt in places. The action does pick up in the last third of the story but the climax comes long before the drawn-out end. I did like the acknowledgement page; however, I don't think he has ""the sister thing"" quite right, at least not until ""big sissa Mandy bunny--now 59 years old--asks her 49-year-old sister Lisey to ""drop the Mandy bunny"" stuff. Only for diehard King fans; others, read Peter Straub instead."
1,Was he paid by the word?,"I'm a big King fan. That said, Lisey's story was disappointing. He tried to do something new but between all the flashbacks and made up words, a reader could lose interest. My wife put it down and never picked it up again.It seemed that he was paid by the word. He would use a cliche, and follow it up with other cliches meaning the same thing, like he was trying to come up with something new, a different way to skin a cat, trying to build a better mousetrap, a new spin on an old story. If that last sentence put you off then Lisey's story isn't for you."
3,Why Kindle? Why?,"I'm having problems reading this title. Parts of the pages at the end of sections are not coming up on my kindle.Other than the technical problems, I like how well King develops his characters, they seem grounded and plausible. Lisey and Scott's love for each other seems very real. They care for each other despite their own faults and flaws.That being said, I can't stand the dialogue in this book. I'm not even 20% in and if I see another use of ""smuck"" instead of the real word, well, let's just say I might smuck you up."
1,Not again!,"This is another attempt to show that he's can write more than horror stories, but it's a pretty bad romance story. If you like the stories that made him famous, skip this one."
1,"This book is ""bad gunky""!","I'll keep it short and sweet. I am a huge King fan. I was surprised when I saw this book at the store (b/c I didn't even know it was coming out). That said, I bought it right away. Well, bottom line is that it was terrible. The made up words were too much!!!! Bad gunky, bools, sowisa, etc....made me want to dump the book after about 100 pages. Also, I found the storyline to be too similar to the Secret Garden. If you are new to King's work, try the Dark Tower Series, or Talisman and Black Room. They will provide much more bang for your buck."
2,disappointed,"This book was terrible. I have read every Stephen King book and short story out there, and have enjoyed most of them, but it was really hard getting through this one. The story was initially very difficult to follow, jumped around irritatingly, and never got going. I always finish what I start, so I felt obligated to finish the book, but it was the biggest waste of time since The Historian.The characters are irritating and don't react to situations appropriately. Their responses to danger often border on the ridiculous.My advice is not to even think about reading this garbage."
1,Boring,"Couldn't get past the first few chapters. Does anybody else miss the old Steven King writing style? King used to be my favorite author. However, his last few books may be seem better to critics but to the unwashed masses..they suck."
1,An aimless and annoying tale,"I love Stephen King's books - I can usually plow through even his less interesting stories. Lisey's Story was different. Echoing the sentiments of other reviewers, the so-called 'secret language' between Lisey and Scott was annoying from the first introduction of the word 'smuck', and King's use of this language was unrelenting. It was annoying and incomprehensible. The story itself meandered along with no real purpose, and finally led to a vapid end. The only thing I felt by the end of the book was relief that the experience was finally over. King usually creates interesting characters, but that is not the case in this book. Scott came across as a complete idiot, Lisey came across as a two-dimensional character who behaved in unbelievable ways. Overall, this is probably King's worse effort to date."
1,Not good,Reader was fine. The writting was poor. I am alone on 16 hour ride.I painfully listened to the first cd. I would prefer silence.
2,Just couldn't get in to it,"After a stoic try I put this book in the donate pile after about 250 or so pages. I just really didn't care what happened to Lisey and in a way I know exactly what will happen to her although I won't finish this book. I was drawn back to King after a many year abscence when I finished Duma Key and LOVED it. He said that Lisey's Story was his story about marriage while Duma was his story about divorce so I figured I'd make the full circle but I,in no way, cared about Lisey and Scott as I had for Edgar and the other characters in Duma.I think I'll borrow Just After Sunset from a co-worker instead of plunking down the $18 - I'm not as trusting as I used to be."
4,King Imagining Himself Dead,"I feel that this whole book was a product of King imagining what his wife might go through after his death--of course with the supernatural stuff thrown in. Not my favorite King novel, but it gives an insight about how highly he thinks of his wife and how he tries to explain the art of writing. Maybe his close call with death made him reflect on his own demise and what really ends up being important to us, which is our soul mate. Power Path to Love"
2,So Disappointed,"Being a hard-core fan of Stephen King, I found this offering to be less than exciting. Yes, it had some high points but, for the most part, it dragged. The story could have been told in many fewer pages without sacrificing a thing."
2,Not the best,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet. Stephen King is one of the greatest storytellers of his time. If you're expecting a real Stephen King masterpiece like Pet Semetary, IT, or The Shining, then this is not it for you. The writing is beautiful and very original. He's creative. But, the story is boring and, in my opinion, a chore to get through. As I said, this was piece of originality and probably a creative endeavour for him, but he's better writing the scary stuff than this boring manuscript of 500 pages."
2,Same Old Steve,"You'd think he was paid by the word. Another bloated text, this time made worse by the juvenile verbiage."
3,So-so,"Learning this book had been released, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. When my husband gave me a gift certificate for my birthday, I thought it would be most fitting to buy a love story from one of my favorite authors. The story started out well enough, and other reviewers have already given enough of the plot away, so I won't, but for some reason it just didnt' keep my interest. I found myself yearning to begin another book. This would have been unthinkable with any of his previous writings. I gobbled them all up like long anticipated birthday cake. I can't put my finger on why exactly it lagged, but I think the story just didn't support 500 plus pages. Although it was a good story with likable good guys and dreadful bad ones,it just wasn't great."
2,Disappointed,"It seems like Stephen is the master of storytelling, but this book - YIKES- it was awful for a master writer!I thought the 1st 30 pages would put me to sleep...it does pick up around page 400, but the book's about done by then! (Thank Heavens!!!)"
1,"Smucking slow, I feel like a Bool for buying this","The reviewers who complain about the overuse of cutesy phrases like ""smuck"" and the slow pace are right on the money. Remember the Seinfeld episode where Jerry and his girlfriend keep saying, ""You're schmoopy""? Well the whole book is like that except King's characters are not joking. Steven King is not F. Scott Fitzgerald or Hemingway, but his stories are imaginative and well paced and his books have always been a lot of fun to read. This is the same guy who wrote Cujo? The Shining? The Dark Tower? I am half-way through this thing and for the first time I am considering not finishing a Steven King book."
3,Ok book...but....,"Due to the fact that i read alot of books, i don't usually write reviews for each, but I just had to do it for SK. Lisey's Story was long.....so long in fact, that I almost gave up halfway through. BUT.....on the flip side, the last part of the book was the best! Granted, King should have pared it down by at least 100 pages and left out ""smucking"", but those of you who just couldn't stomach the first part, hang in there..it does get better. The middle is long and boring, but the part about Amanda and Lisey at the end makes it worth your while!"
1,This book is hopelessly out of date and overly simplistic,"This book gives you a lot of code that won't compile under 32 bit Windows, that in theory does everything he talks about, but always cheats ( for example to convert bitmaps to 16 colour, he converts to 8 colour, tags found in TGA are not supported, etc. ), and basically the only good thing about the book is the jokes he makes between the bad code. There are free libraries on the web that do images better than this book can."
5,Il Postino DVD Zone 1,This DVD was in very good condition. It is on 3 languages. Do not hesitate to add it to your classic foreign collection. It is a gem. JP
5,Great Movie,"Bought it a while back, it's always been one of my all time favorites, beautiful story with wonderful scenery and music, in italian language with subtitles, as always buying from Amazon can't be beat."
5,Charming,"Shows how beautiful and peaceful Italy is. Beautiful beaches, not for swimming but for looking out and just relaxing, getting inspired. The place is poetic.The story has depth. When I'm studying and practicing my Italian, I will definitely be watching this over and over to study the language."
5,small but surprising,"I've never been to Brownsville. You don't have to know the town to get something out of this.This was one of those books that didn't exactly hit me over the head when I read it, but that stayed in the back of my mind afterward. The stories start out small and plain and then turn into unexpected things."
1,Stinks,"Had I read the description on Amazon more carefully (Michelle Yeoh does not actually perform Wing Chun in this movie), I probably would have thought twice about buying it. The movie is from 1994, before Michelle Yeoh and Donnie Yen were big name stars. I bought it thinking the movie would have something to do with Wing Chun. This is just the female characters name. The movie actually is one of those ""comical half the cast gets beaten up"" kung fu movies. Very little to keep your attention or desire to watch it all the way through. I was wondering why Michelle Yeoh would even make such a movie, but this preceeds all of her more modern films, which are great. So if you want the 80's and 90's Kung Fu theater type movie with little story line, go for it. If you want something about Wing Chun and something with a plot, pass on this movie."
2,move on,"I won't spend much time on this album because I can't bear to listen to it again to make this review.There are so many other Culture lps to be had that this one, while it hs a good track or 2 on it, should be ignored. I have no idea what happened during the making of this album, but it never gets the flow that most of their excellent lps, like the classic ""Two Sevens Clash"" or ""Africa Stand Alone"" has.the 2 lps I mentioned should be siught after 1st, then spread out and see where your tastes lie. This lp is one of very few that I do not recommend for anyone."
2,Not Culture's Best,"Oh mfowethu eG-town, yes I hear that you love Culture, but this is by far not their best work. If you want to hear some heavy sounds from Culture, check out ""Harder Than the Rest"", ""Trod On"" or ""17 Dub Shots"". ""Two Sevens Clash"" is also crucial but not as consistently good. Shap bhuti wami."
2,Interesting Start... that fades fast,"Maitresse begins fairly interesting. But about 1/3 through, the energy fades. The plot slows down and seemingly takes a shallow, uneventful trip to a stupid ending.There are some stops on the trip that are worth seeing. Mainly, there are some great fetish outfits. But even the S&M becomes as annoying as the droning dialogue.It's worth adding to your collection, but you'll probably only watch it once or twice."
2,Not good for really squirmy or mobile baby,This tub worked well until my daughter learned how to lean her head forward (3.5-4 months) She rolls forward and her legs go inward into her belly (like a pill bug) and she then proceeds to roll to either side and can potentially go face forward into the bath tub if you're using this in the bath( we don't have large enough sinks to use this at the sink.) I bought it on clearance somewhere besides amazon.com but really wanted to pass on my experience. that and the center divide looks painful on the area that rests on it.
2,Functional at best,"I bought this for my 4 month old daughter since she's temporarily out grown the sink. The foam back and crouch support keeps her from sliding down but need to be more concave. My daughter can easily roll side to side and had nearly rolled right out of the tub. It also makes it very hard to wash her back, butt and groin areas. The tub's not very deep and is designed so she sits up out of the water which causes her to get cold easily. And being as only her feet are really in the water she tends to kick and splash a lot. The pivoting handle is useful to hang the tub on the shower curtain rod. The plug in the bottom of the tub helps drain it afterward and doesn't leak. The temperature indicator is very helpful showing if the water is too cold, too hot or just right. It's an okay tub until my daughter can sit up better and we can go back to using the sink."
3,not much in the water,"My baby loves bath time. We like the fact that he sits along a non-slip back area, but you cannot see his butt at all because of the ""stopper"" that doesn't allow him to slide down. Very little of our baby actually sits in the water during the bath which requires us to continually pour water on him so he doesn't get cold. Hard to find a hook big enough to store this thing on."
2,Not what I expected,I'm not sure how this book has gotten such good reviews. It's very repetitive. I don't think I learned much from it. It's pretty much all the same. They could've easily made this book into a 50 page book without losing much.I'm still going to give these things a try but I don't recommend the book.
3,donated to the public library......,donated to the public library....Psychic Development for Beginners: An Easy Guide to Developing & Releasing Your Psychic Abilities (For Beginners (Llewellyn's)).....hoping others will enjoy this book also....I read a lot of books this one was good but not great!~
1,Dont waste your money,"Wish I had bought a different book. This book has little to do with developing real psychic power, and more to do with silly exercises that are pointless."
2,This book did nothing for me,This book didn't help me at all. Maybe it was me. It was well written but I couldn't put what was in the book to use.
3,Didn't care for this.,"This is a book of exercises for psychic development. The author claims to have had several startling and unexpected psychic experiences in his life that led to a whole new career for him. While his personal story and the exercises he lays out are interesting, I didn't care for this book. It's hard for me to put my finger on it but somehow it all seemed a little ""off"" to me and reminded me of an old saying, ""If something seems to good to be true, it probably is."" In fairness, maybe I just wasn't on the same wavelength and the author wasn't the right teacher for me. Since so many other reviewers feel that they got a lot out of this book, in the interest of fairness I am giving it a neutral rating of three."
2,Bullets Over Korea,"I love the film itself but this copy is bad. The packaging is mostly in Korean, which was the first clue. The sound quality is horrible and the default setting is ""Korean subtitles on"". If you love this movie or would like to, avoid this seller."
1,poor quality,"the stops and skips throughout, especially during the most important parts of the movie. very disappointed."
4,Very funny movie,"Diane West is fabulous! The rest of the cast is very good, although, I don't like John Cusak all that much..."
3,A View of Life Through Paintings,I was a student of Vincent Malta's at the Art Student's League in New York years ago and I must say that this book is unlike the art I knew him to be doing at that time. I find it disappointing to see these images when compared to what he was doing then. I was only interested in the paintings. He was a great teacher. I can't really recommend this booklet.
3,Depends what you pay...not the greatest,"I was able to get this bag at TJ Maxx for 25 bucks plus tax, making it a decent buy for the money. I really wanted the Tumi Large Messenger Bag but, sniff sniff, a little pricey. I just saw the Jupiter, and, although I didn't love it, I thought it wasn't a bad buy.It really isn't...for 25 dollars, that is. Even Amazon's decent price, however, of fifty seems a little much for a bag of this caliber.""Padded compartments"", not so padded. I don't know, it just seems a little ""cheap"". The online picture is slightly promising; don't be fooled, it's just basic nylon. A fair number of compartments, however. Overall, the bag seems like something a highschooler would buy. Not very professional for the business world.Tell you what, go buy me the Tumi large computer messenger in orange color, and I'll trade you for this bag, FREE shipping."
5,Works wonderfully,This works wonderfully. If you have any problems with spelling then this is exactly what you are looking for.
1,Franklin Spelling Ace SA0207A,"This is not worth the money, pretty useless. I would send it back , but I lost the paperwork.I had a Franklin Word Speller for about 15 years, it finally stoped working.I paid about $70.00 for it.Don't buy this Cheap one.I really get tired of loosing money on bad products."
3,Waited a long time for this,"Okay, I waited a while before I rented this because there were a couple of bad reviews. I was pleasantly surprised when the movie turned out to be good. Liked the plot and found that it was better then Phone booth from a few years back."
2,Man on a ledge,Title should change to movie on a ledge. Very disappointing ending . It completely falls flat in the last 30 m inutes . Waste of time and talent
4,Tense thriller,"Acting - very good. Emotional impact - tense and harrowing. Story - good, but with more than the usual number of implausibilities and poorly explained gaps. Overall score 4. Worth your time."
3,Had potential but...,Overall it was ok but the ending left you feeling disappointed. It was suspenseful and the acting was well done but I just wish the ending followed through that way.
4,Surprised me,Wasn't expecting much from this movie and was pleasantly surprised. Was much funnier and enjoyable than I thought it would be!
2,Jagged Edges,"Stay away from these if you have a slot loading dvddrive like on an iMac. They have very unsmooth edges, and get stuck in the slot loading drives. I currently have one stuck in there, and it has pretty much disabled my iMac because all it tries to do is eject the disk whenever its turned on."
4,a great read,"This book I found was excellent. It seemlessly moulds psychology and sci-fi into a great novel. It is one for those enjoy science fiction, yet are willing to deviate a bit into the realm of human psychology; or for those who enjoy human psychology, but also find science a very interesting subject.The single element of this book which I did not like, was one of the ways in which a major conflict of the novel was resolved. I don't want to ruin the plot, but it is right in the middle of the book and I did not find it was written in a believable way.Despite this, it is still a great read, and if you like it, then you'll love Robert J. Saywer's first book (don't be fooled, it's his best) The Golden Fleece."
1,Stiled and Hokey,"This is the first book by Sawyer that I've read, and I doubt I'll go out of my way to read another. The writing was awkward, and the characters were caricatures, not believable human beings. The basic idea of the story was fairly interesting, but it developed into hokey new-age tripe. Not what I was expecting from ""science"" fiction"
2,"He knows the stuff, but he can't write to save his life.",The author has a lifetime's experience in managing bees in Britain and abroad. But as an introduction to beekeeping this book fails miserably. He constantly uses technical terms without explanation and doesn't present the information in any sort of sensible order. My advice is only read this book in the presence of an experienced beekeeper.
1,not for coffee,"The authors just took the other book they have about general restaurant business and added a few pages about coffee. Those few pages, however, are not even useful or accurate, they can't even spell origins right! (Costa Rico? Columbia?? what countries are those??). They also make a lot emphasis on things like drug screening your employees, when they are selling the last psychoactive legal drug called caffeine. I bought several other books about coffee business they are all better."
1,Low quality cuts,"You get what you pay for. The bottom of the groove is not flat. The width of cut is not precise requiring lots of time to set up and shim. The side walls are not clean. I would recommend saving your money and buying the more expensive Freud. It is a tough pill to swallow, but you will not be happy with this dado blade."
2,Poor quality dado set,The blades are not balanced and the bores are several thousands of an inch oversize which contribute to the out-of-balance condition. This also contributes to the grooved bottom of the dado cut. Not for precision work.
2,old and tired DIO,"If you are looking for the vintage DIO this is not it. I recommend ""We Rock"" which has Vivian Campbell on guitar. The guitar player in this video is ok, but can't quite pull it off."
4,"Awsome Title- - ""Love Has A Name"" (recording as well)!!!","I have been a follower of Kathy Troccoli for several years. When I got the new recording, I find myself tapping along and feeling a Warm effect through-out the entire recording that I believe that Kathy was recording to any who listen. Sure,their are those who would say that this recording is a flop/dud. But this recording just proves to anyone with an open mind and heart that their is hope in this world, and that is really want I believe that Kathy really is sharing in the many different styles that the recording offers to us. Thanks Kathy for all of your talent!"
1,pitiful popeye,Very poor quality pictures and sound. I was very disappointed. Grandkids love popeye but could not watch this one. Do not waste your money. Nana Julie
3,Another Poker Flic,I wanted this flic after years of hearing about it. After buying then watching it I am satisfied. Entertaining to be certain but once is enough. I think more effort was spent on finding more ways to say F___than on the actual subject itself. If you like poker as I do then it is entertaining.Now who can I give this to without offending them?Train
5,Rounders,This fascinating look at high stakes and high quality poker gave me a look at a subculture I've never seen before. Matt Damon is wonderful as a poker genius who becomes more congruently himself as the film goes on. John Malkovich is brilliant as a Russian mob guy. I loved watching it wondering what I would do if I played poker.
4,I agree...don't let Damon turn you off,"Great versimilitude to the underworld of poker playing as well as a palatable plot lay the groundwork for an enjoyable movie. However, it is Norton's effortless scene stealing that make this movie recommendable. He is easily become one of the best actors of his generation, and although he outmatches Damon, he is talented enough to assimilate his role with well-paced adroitness, rather than affecting what could easily have been a pedantic performance."
3,Pretty Good,I enjoyed the Card games alot.but I've seen this Film Countless Times already.Edward Norton is a Good Actor.Matt Damon does alright here.but only the Games aside from Norton hold your attention.Everything else feels like Filler.John Malkovich gives a Solid Performance here as well.But it's Two Movies in one the Games Work everything else is Hit&Miss.
3,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Rounders is a mixed bag: Edward Norton plays a really good weasel and the movie knows more about poker than most (with the exception of the single most obvious ""tell"" ever), but John Malkovich is beyond over-the-top as the ridiculously-accented bad guy and the conclusion doesn't make much sense (why is the loan shark angry that **spoiler** Matt Damon won and can now pay him?)."
5,Excellent Service,Ordered this item around the holidays and received it just in time for Christmas in its original packaging and in excellent condition.
4,Awesome Poker Movie,"If your Texas Holdem fan, then you need to have this on your movie list or at least on your shelf."
5,Poker rules!,"If you love poker or are just getting into it then this movie is a must see! Damon, Edwards, Malkovich, Turturro, and Mol give really good performances in this movie. After watching this movie you'll definitely wanna learn how to play poker like they do. Just don't trust your friend if his name is Worm (Edward Norton). If your girlfriend isn't into poker all the way and needs some romance to get through it then check outLucky You"
5,Well made.,"This blade is well made, the weld joint was very smooth. I have it on my Grizzly 14"" bandsaw with a riser kit."
3,Not bad . . .,"This is a decent film, but it doesn't hold a candle to it's big brother, 633 Squadron. 633 Squadron is an earlier film about the DeHavilland Mosquito's role, in part, during WWII. I am a fan of David McCallum so it caught my eye. It is an interesting film, but not a favorite. Given it to do over again I would rent the film, watch it, and leave it at that."
3,Military action movie review,"Movie was not bad - I grew up watching war movies (parents were in the military), director could of shortened the love scenes between David McCallum and Suzanne Neve. Watch with your girlfriend & popcorn"
2,Patched together mess,"This is a scrapbook movie - a little taken from ""Operation Crossbow"", and parts of the rest from a better film about Mosquito bombers called ""633 Squadron"" and David McCallum's ""Beatle"" haircut is absurd."
3,"Not authentic, but good",I like mediterranean food but this cookbook seems tailored for Americans. It's not authentic. But don't let me spoil your appetite.
1,The Everything Mediterranean Cookbook,"This book (in general)contains a basically half dozen base recipies, such as stock, to which various ingredients are added."
4,Nice alternative to traditional meals for my family,Nice book and a good collection of recipes that will be very different for my family. I'm excited to give this a try!
3,Work up front,"I haven't tried any of the recipes yet because most of them require the prior preparation of a stock or sauce (recipes are also provided for these)in order to prepare the main recipe. The recipes sound good and flavorful, but I need to make the time to prepare the sauces/stocks and put them in the freezer so I can make these recipes on a moments notice. So if you're looking for a cookbook that you can just pick up and instantly make the recipe, this is not the one for you."
1,Don't even bother with this one.,"I completely hated this book. It took forever for the author to finally decide what he was talking about. It should have been titled ""A Day in the Life of the Fletcher Family"". This book started really good and then just went downhill. If they put the first five chapters and the last three chapters together, and left out the middle, this would have been a wonderful book."
2,Too implausible,"The story of an average family and their sensitive son had its eerie moments. The end was a major disappointment, which left me unable to tie up all the loose ends."
2,"Surprise ending, but is it worth the effort?","Although it's nice to read a book in which religious people are not depicted as blithering idiots, 'Lost Boys' is not a particularly good book, which is surprising because Card is such a talented writer. I liked the style of having each chapter beginning with the same two words, so each chapter was almost like a mini-story. However, it is far too long for the plot, and I disliked the many dead-end story lines, such as Stevie's evil teacher and Step's dead-end job. Many of the characters simply aren't realistic, and I initially found it difficult to care about many of them. Step's whining about having to work for someone else was particularly annoying. The end arrives abruptly, or rather, the only sense of impending climax is knowing the book ends in less than 30 pages so something has to happen."
4,Nutritious and tasty!,"My puppies are so picky but I couldn't get them to eat any kibble but Royal Canin and Fromm! They still prefer Royal Canin but will eat this too, which I really like regardless of what they think because it's super nutritious. :)"
1,?,"I got this in the mail today and was excited to have a replacement remote for my bedroom tv. I expected it to look cheap and it does, which is fine. It is a black remote, though silver is pictured. I read directions first and put in new batteries...and it doesn't work. The LED light doesn't turn on at all. So, I'm sending it back now. I just wanted a remote that would turn my tv on without me pushing buttons, and this can't even turn itself on. I guess it's hit or miss - good luck."
2,Mediocre,"The jars arrived sticky, which means that sealing did not work properly.It is also nice to do some reading from the tag that came with the product:""Along with international recognition, our products have also been awarded many prizes due to the above merits. Our first prize - Hors Concurs, (international Trade Exhibition, London was awarded in 1932""Hello! That was 80 years ago! No new award since then - ha, ha! I can see why! Besides, it is like saying ""I am pretty; I was Miss Kentucky 80 years ago""... Right!As for the ""thyme flavor"", you may try garlic instead. An attentive reader will say: ""wait, garlic has no thyme flavor""! Exactly!"
4,CHERISH - DAVID CASSIDY,a very nice album w/ quality songs. David Cassidy is the quality of the entertainment business. the 1970's were the glamorous & respectful times.
2,crap,there is some kind of food stuck in the pages. i scraped it out of quite a few pages. it has stained them
2,Horrible movie from a gorgeous book,"Captain Corelli's Mandolin is one of my favorite books, but this movie is terrible. It doesn't nearly do the book justice. Nicholas Cage, who I usually love, is wooden and not at all like the Corelli of the book. The scenery is beautiful and Penelope Cruz, who always glows, does her best. But the ending is truncated and ruined, which takes much of the power away from the story. Don't waste your time with this awful film, read the book."
1,No Sanctity!,"Break the mandolin now! Nicolas Cage can't play an instrument, no! I was expecting to see a stuntman's hands while playing the mandolin, but Cage does it himself. Unfortunately for the audience, he tries to woo Penelope Cruz's heart with atrocious tunes and dire melodies. Christian Bale the same man who played the ""American Psycho"" has an Italian accent? I can't tell, everybody's misplaced in this bread crumb of a movie. Not enough war scenes, I was distraught. Oblivious muddle."
1,Big Disappointment,"If you're thinking of getting this film because you liked the book, DON'T BOTHER! Penelope Cruz sounds like she hasn't quite learned her lines and is reading from a script and Nicholas Cage, who in other films is quite good, made a very silly Antonio Corelli."
2,Not at all like described..,"I bought this mostly to condition and strengthen my thinning lashes..Since it is also a tint, that was a plus..I have tried tints before, and really had no opinion one way or the other..they are what they are, and they are definitely not like a mascara..The thing I did not like about this particular one, was that it is very liquid, and runs and smears..I tried it twice, and had it all over my eyes..kind of a waste of time, money and product.."
3,Doesn't go on well.,I was disappointed. It seemed dried out and my lashes were sticking together. I was expecting it to be easy to put on. I do like the ingredients though. I still use it but not as much.
2,Surprised!,"Was very surprised when we popped this disc in and found that it was totally instrumental. Not that instrumental is bad, but it reminded us of roller skating music. Hope this helps."
3,Groovy,"Its all instrumental, nice, soothing, jazzy, the fellows did motown proudly. Upon seeing the documentary on them, it made me realize, you can have all the nice words, but without the music, Motown couldn't not have been complete."
4,Excellent,"By the time John Fahey made this album with Cul-Du-Sac, near the end of his life, he had stripped his playing to raw eseentials. That grand structure was reduced to long strums, clean and definate as new cut glass.The electrionic bed for Fahey, provided by Cul-Du-Sac, is new context. The backrounds are not heavy, but merkily complex, and provide weight to Fahey's country creek, spare playing.This is a long album, meditative as music comes, but paitants will bring rewards and revelations about Fahey and the art he and Cul-Du-Sac made."
3,Glossy Overview,"I found this to be a glossed overview of the OS. I needed a book that would walk me through the new rendevous connectivity....specifically, the windows SMB connectivity...not here...This book is really geared towards the novice user, with really basic stuff."
3,"""it gets bigger the further you go into it""","at first listening a nasty and very small CD. it seems to have no relation to any of enos previous work and gives the impression that he had a really bad headache during recording and decided to transmit it. by laser. directly to you. that's why i like it - in this country (the uk) eno is fast becoming a national treasure (consultant to big projects, talker about future things etc). it's nice to be reminded that he's essentially an anarchist and he will bite you if you get too close. spiky, unsettled music. you may not like it, but it likes you in a concerned but faintly sinister way. now stop crying."
3,Not for me,"This pack has great waist straps which I was looking for, but the capacity of the bag is small and there are only two pockets. This is a great rock climbing or free style rock running kind of back. Hugs you nicely. For everyday use, it seems impractical given that there are all sorts of crazy straps and you can't fit much in here."
5,Excellent backpack!,"The High Sierra Cirque 30 Pack is the most comfortable pack I have ever owned, even with a heavy load."
4,Watercolor Made Easy,Julie is a delight. Her explanations and demonstrations are concise and easy to follow. Julie's method of getting the correct paint consistency is essential. I highly recommend this DVD for beginners and those of us who are a little beyond beginning.
2,"Not the original version of ""Vehicle""","The CD is OK, but the it's NOT THE ORIGINAL VERSION of the only hit ""Vehicle"". There is no gutiar solo and it runs 1:22 when the original is at least 3 minutes. So if you have heard the GM comericial and wanted this song, don't get this CD."
2,5 Years of Use,"Very good scale. Sleek in design. Gives you all the information you could want.Review update: Jan 2013Unit will no longer work. Replaced batteries to ensure that wasn't the problem, but unit just continues to beep once every 20 minutes and will not reset. May have been a great scale at first, but had hoped it would last longer."
5,Works Great - Great Technology - Great Value,"Wonderful product. It works great, and has a stylish design. Perfect price ($40). Already recommended one to a friend who purchased it and agrees completely!"
1,TANITA COMPANY DOES NOT BACK ITS PRODUCTS,"We purchased the Tanita 533 Glass Innerscan and when we accidentally dropped a small drill bit on it the supposedly shatter-proof glass shattered into a million pieces. We contacted the company and were told that these scales are shatter-proof. The manager we spoke to (Paul) told us that he had personally dropped a sledge hammer on the scale without any damage to it. We stated that this was our point, that if the glass was not defective it would not have shattered in this way.We were asked to email photos to prove our damage claim, which we did. We were then told that the company would do nothing to replace the product. They invited us to purchase a new scale. Free shipping."
4,Excellent with some reservations,"The scale is attractive and appears to be accurate. My only reservation is that I'm a little suspicious about its ability to measure all the different variables. If you experiment several times per day you'll discover that you get results that sometimes don't make sense, compared to previous readings. You must understand that body fat is measured as a PERCENTAGE of your weight. This means that if you maintain the same amount of fat, but are 2 pounds lighter due to dehydration (say, after a work out), your body fat PERCENTAGE will actually go up. Of course you don't really have more actual fat. It's important to use the scale at the same time each day to determine your progress.I'm very happy with the scale. I just wish I understood better how it works."
3,Starts out Good,"This product appeared to be a solid, after a year of use the scale never changes my body fat. I work out daily, step class, spinning class, kettle bell classes, my Tanita BC533 Glass Innerscan Body Composition Monitor read ""never changes remains 35%,not accurate,I have had myself evalated at a gym because this scale is not on target after so many uses.I would skip this item and spend the $5.00 at a gym for an accurate read.For an active person who is 150 pounds and 5'8 , no way the scale should indicate 35% body fat."
4,Good Info.,"The scale gives you good information for your day to day fitness level. If the information is correct, that's anyones guess."
5,Blow Dry,"I loved it~ As a Stylist I found this Movie to be just wonderfully fun~ There is so much that really does go into ""working with hair""~ Competition in this field is next to none~ I owe all the Good Works of Art from Farouk Systems ""Late Xenon""~ who passed away last year~Buy the film you will love every second of it!"
5,one of the best british comedies,"I absolutely loved this movie. What hmade the movie was Alan Rickman and BillNighy. they are an absolute scream. it has comedy, drama, and fun. i would higfhly recommend this movie to anyone who likes to laugh and be entertained!!!!!!!"
2,The only one,"I seem to be the only one who watched the movie Blow Dry for this reason but oh well. I watched it because I am a HUGE Rachael Leigh Cook fan. That's all...It is about a man in a hair competition that is cheating, using his daughter, Christina, Rachael Leigh Cook..."
4,"Cold, but in a good way","It's a little dark at times, very cold at times, a little ""spacy"" at times. But always interesting. Tracks such as Poa Alpina, Chukhung, and Antennaria are wonderfully chilly and damp, while The Things I Tell You is more space-electronic (and maybe not as good). There's a nearly cheerful moment with Times I Know You'll Be Sad, then you're back in the cold with the remaining few tracks. A very good listen.The things I tell you will not be wrong."
2,matt,"this book is a decent account of John Wilkes Booth, but there is nothing that has not been already examined in countless other books pertaining to this topic. The book does not give as much detail about booth as one would expect. If you really want a great book about John Wilkes Booth, Lincoln's assaination, and the several weeks that followed, i strongly recommend ""American Brutus"" by Michael W. Kauffman, this was one of the best books ive ever read on the subject."
5,A new genre,"This book was a great departure, from what I normally read, which is black fiction, based around romantic relationships. These books are more commonly known as ""sistagurl"" books. This book was written intelligently, and dealt with issues that we can all relate to in society. This book was a page turner, filled with mayhem, suspense, love, hate, violence, peace, and introspection. This novel makes the reader feel as though they are a part of the story, and I hope it will go on to be a best seller."
4,Standard Delta Band Saw Blade,Hard to find locally. Found with this seller. Prompt and easy transaction.
4,Good but The Audiobook is sufficient,"I listened to the audiobook which gives the reader the main points of the book and I think covers the topic fairly well. I would rather spend my reading time on books offering more substance and just ""listen "" to books such as this which I consider light reading."
3,Almost Famous Hits,"I have found this collection to be very good. However there are quite a few hits missing. Where is "" Touch Of Lightning "" For some reason this song has yet to be released on CD.I am getting tired of the same old songs being released over and over. I know that I could do a better job of picking out songs than whoever is working for Polygram Records and a few other Record companies."
1,A wast of money,first thing first the cap was hard to screw on it took at least 4 attempts to get a tight fit then i put water in and it still leaked i ended up taking two two litter waters for my backpacking trip dont buy this product
2,This isn't the Keegan I know,"I'm a big fan of John Keegan's books. His ""Face of Battle"" is one of the best books I've ever read. Keegan's appeal as a historian has been his objectivity and ability to present all sides of an issue. Unfortunately, ""The Iraq War"" was a big disappointment. The first chapters that provide a history of Iraq are unbiased and informative. The following chapters that describe the politics prior to the war and the war's justification are anything but. Furthermore, his description of U.S. and U.K. military forces resembles a recruiting poster more than it does a history book. While I was happy to see Sadaam removed from power and am proud of our armed services, I would have preferred to see a more balanced account of the conflict."
1,Did Keegan actually write this dreck???,"Let me start by saying that I have read many Keegan books and found every one thorough, informative, and enjoyable. I have also read several books on the recent conflict in Iraq. I must say that this book is far below the very high standard that John Keegan has set for himself with earlier works. In fact I wondered many times as I read this if Keegan even wrote the vast majority of this work. The sentence structure is virtually unreadable (not something I normally comment on but jeez!!), and the content is very sparse. An utter waste of time and a shameless attempt to get a piece of literature into the marketplace before interest waned. The worst book I have read this year. Unless you have been living off planet for the last 2 years you would have gotten more information from CNN and the internet than this pathetic effort brings to the table."
2,Disappointing book,"Mr Keegan is one of the best military historians of our time but unfortunately he seems to run out of steam with each passing year. ""The Iraq War"" is not a book about military history but a collection of political and diplomatic analysis which was done rather in haste in order to get published. The author devotes less than 80 pages to the actual military operations and the description of units, troop movements, logistics and leadership decisions are poor to say the least. It is a pity to see a renowned military historian to treat a modern campaign like OIF in such a general and boring manner. I'm eagerly waiting for his next real hit which will be equivalent to ""The Face of Battle"". As for OIF, you should better read Walter Boyne's or Williamson Murray's books, or even better the recently published memoirs of General Tommy Franks who presents a real professional view of both OEF and OIF."
1,Don't Buy This,"This video was extremely poorly made, is very outdated, and makes you not want to go to Greece. It literally pans for a solid hour on grimy alleys, hallways, doorways, light fixtures, then back again. It's painful. I don't know how they got away with calling this a sightseeing or travel video. I hope I save you the money I should not have spent."
3,Echimosis,"I can't decide if Celebrity is just sloppy or if Woody Allen was finally getting more comfortable with himself. This film has some of the same themes we have seen before:the lack of interest in fidelityfugitive emotionswanting what ever it is that you can't havebad food and such small portionsa lovely moment that goes horribly wrongJudy Davis getting hystericalBut this time we see everything without the layer of charm we have been trained to expect from WAFPs.I can't help wondering if the film would have gone better if Joe Mantegna had played the nebbishy husband and Kenneth Branagh played the studio exec.The film fails in that by the end, we are ready to say goodbye and we don't care what happens to the only copy of the novel. Didn't they have computers when this film was made?"
3,Above Average--Slightly.,"Celebrity is a movie more good than bad as it has a certain visual appeal that most of Woody's later films lack. I read in an Allen biography that he tried to stop Kenneth Branagh from impersonating him on set. Unfortunately, he wasn't persuasive enough as Branagh's performance was more a caricature of Woody than anything else. As for Judy Davis, who I like in practically everything, she is misused. Her personality is more exaggeration than person. It seems to me that Allen cleaved off various neuroses from his own personality, and then evenly distributed them to the male and female leads. There's just not a whole lot of depth to this film. It fails to teach us anything that is not blatantly obvious, but it certainly was entertaining. Enjoyment alone is why I give it three stars."
1,Woody Allen at his worst,"Woody needs to rethink the formula. And someone needs to tell Kenneth Branagh that imitating Woody is the most awful thing he can do for his appeal. It was a weak story line, lousy acting, annoying cinematography, pure drivel. How so many stars can participate in a project without any of them noticing what a piece of garbage it is frightens me. Do not buy - especially if you liked any of Woody's earlier stuff. I am so disappointed."
1,Not just one of Allen's worst movies...,"But one of the worst, most disjointed, unintelligent & unfunny movies ever made. Allen seems to make films for therapy, definitely not for art. There's something desperately - well, desperate about all his films, but a few have enough humor & insight to garner him a reputation as a film-maker. Just watch the banana simulation here to see how desperate & unfunny this one gets."
2,One really great song.,"""Another Girl Another Planet"" has been one of my favorite songs for years and years, and I spent a long time trying to find anything else from this band. Obviously there's room for disagreement here, but I didn't find any of the other songs memorable in the least. Not bad but kinda tepid power pop. If you have a record player try to find the ""That Summer"" soundtrack, otherwise buy this but don't get your hopes up."
5,~*Joe*~,"Joe's newest CD which contains such great songs as ""I wanna know"", and one my favorites, ""Treat her like a lady"" is one of the best CD's that I have ever bought. He sings with such a tremendous voice that it can touch just about anyone who ever listens to it. I bought this new CD because I had loved his previous one as well. Listening to this with anyone, especially someone you love, can just create a feeling of warmth. I really suggest that if your considering to buy this CD than go ahead; if you are unsatisfied with even one song on the disc, the one that you are satisfied with is enough to make you eager to await for his next upcoming CD."
5,"Touching, simply touching",A tapestry of great performances and clever writing that will make you cry rather you want to or not.
3,nice twist,"Okay so it wasnt a huge heart grabber, but the casting could not have been better. Madeline Stowe, as always, showed realism. Angie Jolie stole the movie with her sincerity and convincing detail into the depths that we would travel for love. Sean and Gina...well need I say more? A must see at any rate, DVD or not."
2,Big disappoitement,"After reading all the great oppinions about this movie and seeing the actors list I was expecting for something better. In this nonrealistic movie, nothing really happens, everyone is dying or about to go that way (mostly from aids) - and of course - the so called happy end is inevitable."
5,WOWZERS!,"We were just perusing, looking for something good...then we started reading the cast list for ""Playing By Heart."" Jilian Anderson, John Stewart, Sean Connery, Ryan Phillipe, Angelina Jollie, Madeline Stowe, and Dennis Quaid, just to name a few of our favorites! Then we watched it and things just got better. Its subtle and colorful, and you're never waiting for next scene except in anticipation!!"
4,Very fun and true to form,I actually participated in the making of this movie. I was sad to see the poor marketing by Miramax. This movie has such a wide variety of well known actors it's hard to imagine that it can be anything else but great. All of the stars played their parts beautifully.
1,I really hated this movie,"It's rare that I won't give a movie at least an hour to see if it's any good, but after about 20 minutes, this one was just too awful to continue. Both lead characters are unlikable, and the gross-out scene of people drinking margaritas into which sweat has dripped is just too much. Why would these people EVER fall in love? The whole premise is ridiculous, and the acting is terrible.I had never heard of this movie before I spotted it on Amazon Prime, and now I see why."
3,Not as good as the shampoo,"The Shampoo had less of a citrus scent than this. This conditioner gave me a headache sometimes while showering because of the strong citrus scent. I seldom use this. Get the shampoo, skip the conditioner."
3,Not NEW!,"I ordered this book hoping it would come packaged and brand new, but that was not the case. The top of the plastic packaging is opened on one end as if to slip the book in and out for re-selling as new later on. The pages look new at least, but the front and back cover are a little banged up and slightly worn, which does not look new! However, the book is useful for my classes in psychology."
1,Unknown,Hi I'm Lynn I was Thinking Of Buying This book DSM-IV-TR. forThose of you who already have it.Is it just a referance book or arethere any tests in it that tell you what the diagnosis is?If nothave you seen anything like thisanywhere? Feel free to E-mail me lynnfromselah@webtv.net Thank you Lynn
1,Rip off,The product is a copy of an original. It has the look and feel like someone zerox the entire book and binded it together with glue. It is so obvious that its not an original book but a very poorly zerox copy someone probably had done using their own printer.
4,Required text in the field of psychology,"The DSM-IV-TR is fairly straight forward and easy to understand. It is not perfect and has limitations in application, but is good overall. If you are entering the field of psychology, this is a must-have. All psychiatric or psychological diagnoses must meet the criteria of this book. This will not tell you how you should treat disorders. It just gives the criteria and descriptions of each recognized mental disorder. If you want to learn about treatment, you will need an additional text such as the Manual of Psychopathology."
4,DSM IV for everyone,"This book has helped me immensely in that it reviews all symptoms, diagnoses that any given person might want to look over. Whether you work with children or adults, this comprehensive volume is an asset to anyone wanting to aid or understand people."
1,PISSED,"I never got this damn book. OH they took my money, but no book came. This is absolutely ridiculous, I needed that book for school and it never came. It makes me not want to buy anything from Amazon again that's for sure"
2,DSM IV,"The book covers were so brittle, I had to put tape all over them. The print inside the book was rubbing off onto opposite pages. Old book. It looked like it was bootlegged or ancient or something strange."
3,"If you don't need this book, wait for the next one","The DSM-IV-TR is currently being revised and the next publication is slated for May of 2012. That being said, if you're interested in the conceptualization of mental disorders you'll want this one to compare the new one to. If you have a copy of the DSM-IV (and not the Text Revision) already, wait until 2012 to purchase the new one.Todd Finnerty, Psy.D.Psychologist, AuthorDepressive Personality Disorder: Understanding Current Trends in Research and Practice"
5,Review of DSM-IV-TR,"Very well written, clear and concise. Should buy hand book together with this, it makes it very easy to carry around!"
4,DSM IV TR,"Great amount of information and content, as well as tools to use with my clients. Speedy delivery as well. Cant wait for the next version to come out."
4,DSM-IV-TR,This is a required reference book for anyone working in the mential services area. I started an internship and needed a copy to help classify clients as to the problem they are having. This book is the standard for the listing of mential disorders.
4,"Useful, but wait if you can.","While there is plenty of back-and-forth between professionals about the usefulness of the diagnostic criteria in DSM-IV-TR, it is the standard currently used in the United States for diagnosing mental disorders. If you need it professionally or for school, there is no way to get around the necessity of purchasing it. However, the DSM-V will be released soon and so this book will be obsolete in the near future. If you are a student, ask your professor if you can use the little DSM desk reference instead (it still has all the criteria and is cheaper) or if you can use the older print of the DSM-IV if you can find it at a used book store. Essentially, try to spend as little money as possible on the DSM-IV and wait for the DSM-V if you can."
5,Great buy,Very happy with this purchase - no problems with quality of product or delivery. I'm glad I bought the DSM-IV - was thinking of holding out until DSM-V is released but am happy with decision :)
4,fast service,"Received this faster than expected. Front cover was somewhat bent from shipping, but the book is otherwise in great condition."
5,Necessary for Psychology Student,"This textbook is a must have for any student wanting or currently studying any field of psychology. It provides much needed information on diagnosis on mental disorders that a psychologist will be trained to be involved with. It organizes all the information in a way that will make it easier for the individual to understand and comprehend. A great manual for any student, but a necessity for psychology."
1,falling apart,"from the very first day that I opened the book, it started falling apart! I'm still using it since I need it for class, but it's a disaster!"
2,Smells aweful,The book came in a package that did not protect it very well and it got bent out of shape. Then when I opened the package and started reading the book it smelled like rat poison. It is a very important book for my profession and I can't stand to open it.
3,You will have a disorder by the end of the book!,"Yea, not recommended for hypochondriacs. Even a sane person will feel crazy at the end of the book. I think some psychologists use this book, like bible dipping to diagnose patients!"
1,Extremely irritated and dissatisfied.,Still have not recieved item...Ordered it November 8th and nobody will return my emails I have filed a claim and still nothing has been recieved. There is no tracking number and I have never ordered on here before....any advice because I want my money back given that I have not recieved my item!!!!!!! I am out of ideas/options. PLEASE HELP!
1,Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-TR-fourth Dediton (text revistio,"When I recieved the book it had a broken spine. It will not last.....this is a resource product that will need to be replaced very soon. I am not happy particularily since it was advertised as ""Like New"""
1,DSM-IV-TR FOURTH EDITION,"The book was intact. However, the printing was poor.The pages were dull in color because of the ink.Likewise, there were ink stains in several pages.I will not recommend it."
4,Useful Reference Book,"This reference manual is massive, but very informative and comes in very handy if you are studying abnormal psychology, studying to become a psychologist, psychiatrist, therapist or counselor. It really helps you understand what truly is a disorder and what is not."
5,Insane,"It's insane y'all. You will get a totally insane workout and will drop pounds if you follow and do what Sean T saids. Stay on the plan and you will see the results if not you, your friends will see the difference and will want to join you. I'm a believer now thanks Sean T."
4,Takes more than the videos.,"I bought this for my wife as a Christmas present. I could never get her to go to the gym with me and this seemed like a good alternative. The video and workouts are great from what I watched. But she lost motivation and stopped doing the workout after two weeks.So if you think that you can keep your motivation and dedication to the workout at a high level and workout at home or wherever you decide to use the videos then this would definitely be a great workout for you especially if you are not familiar with building a fitness routine for yourself. Do not be disheartened if you cannot do as much as the people in the videos (they even stop and take breaks). Worth the money in my opinion, if you can stick to the workout."
3,"I just hope I can do this workout. Going thru Amazon, even if I succeed, I won't get the famous Insanity tee shirt.","I think the charting of your success is good. Please note that the makers of this Insanity video, BeachBody, offers so many varieties of workouts. Determine which is your style, and then go from there, be it dancing, stretching, kickboxing, and then buy from Amazon for a good, competitive price."
3,Insanity,"Got the product quickly and all in a nice case. Only problem was, getting it to work on my DVD player. I had to switch DVD players to get them to work. Unsure if that is because they are used/refurbished or not. I do not have any problem playing any DVD in that player, but this one.Other then that, ready for the challenge."
4,girlfriend loves and hates it,it was what she wanted for Christmas so ordered it she's down 3 pounds in the first week and loves it but has to take after each work out.
1,Terrible,The order came in decent time but 4 out of the 10 disks are completely damaged and not even usable. A few of the other disks also have damaged spots that skip when your trying to use them. I was beyond upset with the quality because of how much it was listed for.
1,Disappointed in quality of DVD's,2 videos came damaged and would not play. The rest of them are fine and I actually like the workout.
3,good videos but mislabeled,The DVDs are fine but the labels on them are not what DVD is actually. We had to go through and watch the videos and relabel them by what DVD it should say on the outside.
3,"Good, but not great","Although this workout program is very intense, I feel it is too intense for anyone trying to lose weight to be able to do the right way. The workouts they do are so hard that I probably am only able to do 75% of the video. I am finished with the first month, and I have not lost any weight. However, I have gained muscle mass. My legs especially are a lot more toned than they used to be, and my arms as well. My stomach has shrunk a bit, but again I have not lost any weight on the scale. I am hoping that is because I have lost weight but gained muscle, so it has evened out?? We will see how month two goes. Also, very repetitive. The moves in the videos are basically the same. It is the same warm up every day done three times in a row. It makes the whole program seem more tedious than it actually is."
3,Not a good as P90X,"I thought this was OK compared to p90x, which I liked better. This is a challenge and the workouts do wear me out, but I thought p90X was put together much better and has better exercises. I found this useful for traveling when I did not have a weightroom or time for a long run."
5,Holy Cow! That was INSANELY AWESOME!,"Started this program Sept. 17, 2012 and just finished yesterday Nov. 18, 2012. All I can say is, ""WOW!!"" The results I got were amazing and I had to give it my all. I'll be getting my free t-shirt soon because ""I EARNED IT!""...looking forward to round 2 and then possibly INSANITY ASYLAM!!Dig Deeper!!"
4,Insane.,"I like it a lot; it's all cardio based. I'm going into week 4, and have lost several lbs! The meal plan is rough...I don't like having times meals, but it's worth it. The workouts are pretty crazy, but I enjoy them."
4,oh my god!,"i just got mine in the mail today and couldn't wait to get started. i just now completed the fit test and let me say that everything i read is true. i haven't even started the actual workouts yet and i'm drenched and exhausted from only 30 minutes of work! and i am by no means out of shape. i'm 35, and i've been exercising for 15 years. i've done every kind of cardio you can think of: step, slide, boot camp, kickboxing, circuit, spin, yoga, you name it. if the fit test was hard, i can't imagine how difficult the actual workouts are going to be, but i am up for the challenge and i will definitely report back my results."
1,Definitely NOT for everyone!,"there should be an extreme notice for this workout: it is most definitely not for everyone. if you are already in great shape, and are looking to enhance your workout, then this might just be for you.If you are looking to get into shape, this is most definitely not for you! There is no way that a beginner or intermediate could handle this, which sort of goes against the grain of buying such a product to get back into shape!"
5,"If you commit, it works!","This program is not just hype, it works. My husband and I started after the new year, and in 5 weeks he has lost 17 pounds and looks so much better! Also wearing pants he hasn't worn in about 5 years. My weight is down a couple pounds, but I didn't really need to lose any; I'm getting in way better shape and and firming up my arms and butt, very noticeable. We follow the diet plan that comes with it and are taking it seriously, but we're not totally crazy. Anyway, if you are serious about getting in shape, this program WILL work and is worth the money."
5,AWESOME !!,"Insanity is great for ppl with busy schedules and wants to keep in shape. The workouts are 40mins and you can go at your own paste,your results depend on you but I guarantee your going to sweat, loose weight, and get in shape... TRY IT, IT WORKS"
4,way intense,super intense! i love this because it really kicks yer butt. im on my second week of it and i gotta say i am feeling muscles that i have not used in a long long time.
5,Gift for my daughter,This was what my daughter wanted for her 16th birthday. I didn't want to buy new as I was unsure if she would stick with it. She loves it and had no idea thta it was not new....We both won...
3,Good...but not Great,"You get a better workout with 90X.Insanity is good, it is heavy duty jumping and there is too much time between exercises. P90X is harder and keeps my interest. The hardcopy material were visually pleasing, but lacked content. I will keep Insanity, but it wasn't worth the $$$. Also I had multiple problems with DVDs being bad: one wouldn't load, others had video issue halfway through the DVD. Be sure to check your copies and use all disks immediately if you purchase this product.Update: P90X is much better. I returned this product."
1,"OMG! FORGET IT! Work at your own pace, unless you are their age!","I am in my late 40's and have always been in shape until recently. I really was hoping for something to kickstart me back into shape, but THIS IS SOOOOOOOO NOT MY ANSWER. All the people in the video are young and ripped.I did the first few exercises and did the butt kick and felt a sharp stab in my left knee.I stopped and bringing it back to our library.Suggestion... Get it from your library first and try it out before you buy? Maybe you will love it, but I would much rather work at my own pace. They tell you not to sacrifice form, but you try to keep up and then the form is blown.Sorry, but it would be insanity if I kept doing this. This was NOT for me. Going back to Margaret Richard and Body Electric"
1,scratched and skipping dvd's Really!?!,"I started playing the dvd's one day at a time per the program and i'm now on dvd 4 and day 4, Three of the 4 dvd's are scratched and skipping one of which only plays until 14 mins in and then won't play past that point.....I feel like I was ripped off by this seller and will not use them again, really $100 and you send me scratched up hardly playing dvd's shame on you!"
3,insanity,"This was sent in a timely manner however it was not the original Beach Body product. I believe this was some copied version and even the poster enclosed and guide had a lot of spelling errors which Beach Body would not allow to happen. Overall not bad for price, but not the real thing."
2,Half the videos didn't work,"I'm giving this review half the stars because half the videos were scratched, skipped & not useable. Should be listed as ""used like used"" not ""used like new""."
4,Insanity is an insane workout,I enjoyed these exercises. They really challenge me and I lost some weight. I have completed two weeks of the planned workouts.
5,Puddles of Sweat!,"This workout is insanely tough. You will drink buckets of water, and sweat it all out. The workout consists of a bunch of exercises using only your own body weight to work your entire body: pushups, suicides, high knees, all kinds of stuff. There are a lot of intervals, where Shaun T has you doing exercises in three progressively faster stages. As has been mentioned, you just gotta go at your own pace--if you can't keep up with the people in the video it's OK as long as you're doing your best. Even the people in the videos take occasional breaks when things get too much for them.FWIW, I'm 39, 5-10 and was 162 when I started the program. I only lost about 5 lb, but got pretty cut. IMO the real benefit of the program is the cardio shape it gets you in."
5,you gotta want to get fit with all your heart and soul!,I have lost 100 pounds doing p90x &insanity :) just keep pressing play and after a while you will want to workout! My advice is put some Pandora on it makes the workout more fun!!
5,Great workout,"I'm 195'7""145 lbsI haven't always been in great shape but I have been for the past few years due to joining the Marine Corps. I lifted weights for a while to bulk and was looking for something to cut. This workout is great and I highly recommend it to people looking for a challenge. The workout is intense but I wouldn't recommend it for beginners or individuals with bad joints or back problems. The routine is fast-paced, challenging, and exhausting!Good Luck,Semper Fi"
5,Awesome,"The workouts are quick and intense, no equipment needed. You know the workouts are difficult when people on the DVD are taking breaks in the middle of the workouts. It is seriously a good system that you can go at your own pace and modify the workouts little to work around injuries or physical limitations and still get a good workout. I highly recommend it!"
5,Beginners...,I'm a beginner on this program.. in fact I got it for Christmas and this is only my forth day doing it. I'm not in good or bad shape.. I'm average weight.. a female.. and kind of lazy. The fit test was really hard but I didn't die doing it either.. you have a chance to go at your own pace and do what works for your body.. Shaun T just pushes you to dig deeper to get better results. Yesterday I did the plyometrics dvd and I had to quit with seven minutes left because my legs were like jello. My abs burn like crazy and I've never loved the feeling more. I look forward to doing it everyday.. hopefully I can see results in the next few weeks.
3,Disc 2 of 2nd Month Faulty,"This is an excellent workout--however, hugely dissappointed that can not do the 2nd disc of the 2nd part because the disc doesn't work--I've tried it in 3 different dvd players. Please be aware and chime in if your set was missed by quality control as well."
5,Challenging but great!,"Great workout if you want to get your cardio in shape. If you do it religiously you can't help but loose weight. I am a runner and wanted a new challenge, well this is a challenge! I start dripping sweat in the first 10 min. I have not worked up to the longer workouts yet, but I will. I would diffintely recommend them if you are up for a challenge!"
3,"Good, but too much jumping","Maybe it would be better for younger people, but I can see that even the people in the videos themselves are having a hard time.It is good, but too much jumping that even my 11 year old son got some back pains because of it. I think you have to be already fit to use this program."
5,INSANITY!!!,Its great. It was definitely worth the buy. Everything was there and the dvd workouts work. I would recommend Insanity to anyone and to buy it from Amazon.
2,Insanity,This dvd selection and workout is not for everyone. It is very hard and very fast paced. Even some of the people demonstating the video could not complete the workout. They focus on repetition as fast as possible. This doesn't make sense to me because I have always been taught to focus on form so that you don't get hurt. There is no way to keep your form in these workouts. Very expensive!
1,Don't buy it - DVDs may not work,"Got this set brand new, and some of the DVDs do not work - pain in the ass to get them replaced. Searched online and apparently many people have this problem with Insanity. If you give it as a gift, you have to make sure people know all your info so they can get the replacement DVDs if they'll even give them. I guess you have to just buy them yourself if you want them - and definitely don't buy through a 3rd party!"
2,messed up dvd's!!,"So far I have loved Insanity....but would be nice if I could use all of the discs. 3 of the 13 don't work, very disappointing especially after paying so much for it. My advice-buy from BeachBody.com!!! not some random seller."
5,Amazing!!,"This product is fantastic. It definitely kicks your butt, but it is so worth it. The workouts are not your typical workouts and I really like that. I also like that it comes with different booklets, especially the nutrition/meal one and the calendar that tells you which workout to do each day to maximize weight loss and strengthening."
4,really cool,"I love this purse. I've had it a little while now and since the fabric is so sturdy I don't worry about it breaking. When I first opened up the package I was worried because it seemed a bit smaller than in the picture, but it actually holds quite a bit of stuff. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it came with done loose strings around the zipper area. I literally spent hours looking online for a new purse, as I am super picky, and I couldn't love this purse more. It seems to have a slightly gothy feel which works for me but may not appeal to everyone."
4,Not exactly as pictured,"I ordered the black bag expecting it to come with the dethklok emblems... But it does not have them. Although I do like the bag, it dissapointed me because of this and the size is very small."
5,Will blow your mind!,"When you first see the book, it looks very daunting. Howevere as you read you just want to read more and more. I've read my fair share of books, but none have ever captivated me like this wonderful Novel. A must read for everyone."
3,Mellow lovers rock,"This pleasant album kicks off with a lovely version of Dreamland and winds its way through bubbly little ditties like Mark My Word, Feel Like Jumping and Melody Life. Her version of Bob Marley's Lonesome Feeling is moving and soulful, as is the uplifting Survival. I've Got To Go Back Home is atypical with its soulful spoken intro and her soaring vocals alternating with slower passages. Together with Rita Marley and Judy Mowatt, Marcia remains among my top 3 Jamaican female vocalists."
2,the projection does not appear,"I bought this thing to solve a problem and I have a new one, I red the little manual, trying to figure out how to have a projection and no way. It does not stay in projection mode, if you want to see the light projection you have to press the button. I change the battery, I left the clock for 26 minute before to change the paramenters and no way. I wil buy one more expensive but one that work the projection. Of course I do not recogmend it."
1,Atomic Projection Alarm Clock,This product was purchased as a Christmas gift and unfortunately did not work as advertised. The projection light only was operational when touched - perhaps this was defective. I have returned the product for a refund and am awaiting the refund.
3,Good Product - Not Perfect,The Good - nice red illuminated numbers on the ceiling for easy night time viewing. This was my primary reason for purchase.The Not Perfect - can not independently rotate display image on ceiling without rotating the entire clock - this results in not being able to see clock display when the ceiling clock is in proper orientation from bedside. Radio time reception impossible in Florida regardless of room location. Clock operation overly complex even to set the time - no focus on projected image - user manual fair.
4,Entertaining,"""Knock Em' Dead"" is the 12th in the 'Murder, She Wrote' novel series. Donald Bain has managed to capture the tone of the television series it is based on, making for an entertaining if occasionally light read.Whilst this novel isn't a literary classic, it isn't a bad story either. It's clearly written, at the best moments a page-turner and at its worst moments still readable without getting bored."
3,MORT METZGER AND SETH HAZLITT,LIKE TO KNOW WEATHER THE CABOT COVE MALES WILL BE IN THIS NEW BOOK OR NOT LET ME KNOW BEFORE I BUY SO I KNOW IF I LIKE OR NOT OKAY
5,BOYD RICE AND DOUGLASS P. WHO COULD ASK FOR MORE!,"All is said in the title... These two come together to illuminate a most wonderful experience. Again, without hesitation this is a must have for any collection. The beauty of this music will overwhelm your soul..."
3,Uncomfortable!!,"I'm usually a size 9. But these sandals were super tight around my ankle. They are really cute, and the colors look great, but I don't even think a 9 1/2 would fit either! The ankle strap was just to tight, and they were overall uncomfortable. Also it's not like I have a big foot!"
3,Bitita's Diary,"Bitita's Diary is the testimonial of a poor Brazilian woman named Carolina Maria de Jesus. Carolina grew up in the 1920s and 1930s. She lived in both the city as well as the countryside, and clearly recalls the rough living conditions she had to endure. This book dose not only describe what it was like to live in poverty, but also gives you the unique perspective of a poor woman in a patriarchial society. I found this book to be very informative. Carolina understandably writes about the terrible living conditions she had to endure, but also gave some thought to political policies, and their impact on society. While there was a lot of valuable information found throughout the book I feel that if the information was better organized into seperate arguments the book might be a more valid resource. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about women in latin America."
4,One Complaint....,"This is a great cookbook, I use it frequently and for the most part have good success. However, the nutrition information for each recipe is lacking, protein/sodium amounts are not listed and the fat content is not broken down. Other than that, it's a great book."
2,New Oxford Book of Christian Verse,"Although this book covers the majority of great Christian poetry, it leaves out some key authors such as Galway Kinnell. Its choice of John Donne poems is puzzling. Further, there are no biographical or textual notes that would help the reader. I had hoped to use this book for a high school class, but it will not be helpful to my students."
5,Awesome Product,I ordered this fence system after lots of research and looking at several other systems and now that I have it and its installed I am extremely happy with my purchase. It came with more than enough wire to do my 1/2 acre + some and was fairly easy to lay out just took some time. After digging the trench and laying the wire hooking it up was easy and my dog a 1 year old German Shephard approx. 70 lbs learned her boundaries in less than 20 minutes on the correction setting 2. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to keep their dog safe and under control. Thanks a lot Sport Dog!
4,Love to see what he has next,"I would say watch it and keep them coming, it was great. I enjoy to see if they get in trouble too."
5,Be careful what you do,We bought this gift last Christmas for our 9 year old grandaughter. She has just visited us and brought the 'spy car' with her. It's still going strong and is so much fun. She had a sleepover a few months ago and the car was the hit of the party. Just be sure to close doors if you don't want little ones to see what you're doing.It's educational if you consider learning how to look through one eye as educational!!!
3,If only it was made well,"This toy is so much fun... when it works. The boy that I work with got his for Christmas last year and it was so cool... for a week. Then the wheel fell off and the parts were so tiny that we couldn't them. It was a very expensive piece of trash. I then bought my daughter one thinking that it was just a fluke that his was junk. However, when my daughter's spy car arrived the video camera was faulty and we got no picture through the glasses. I think that if they put as much thought into the production as they did into the concept it would be amazing, however, I think they need to go ""back to the drawing board"" and get it right."
1,Waste of MONEY and TIME!,"I bought this expensive toy for my son's birthday and it NEVER worked. The controller does not get a signal and there is nothing in the manual about how to solve this issue. We discovered a tiny ""sync"" button on the controller and on the car itself, but still doesn't work. I called Wild Planet and have left SEVERAL messages during business hours and no one has returned my call. I finally got a person on live chat who suggested I repress the sync buttons, did that AGAIN... the car still doesn't work. Then they asked me to ship the car to them to have it refurbished!!! ugh! I'm returning this one. Now that I have read other reviews online, I wish I had bought something else for my son so he wouldn't have suffered such a huge disappointment on his 6th birthday."
1,WARNING: TERRIBLE PACKAGING,"I have to wonder if anyone associated with the packaging of this toy actually has children. This was the MOST frustrating packaging I have ever encountered (and I have two daughters who love Barbie, so that really is saying something). We actually had to purchase a new screwdriver to unscrew the plastic backing from several of the screws they used to bolt the product to the box. None of our Philips screwdrivers worked. I would recommend that this company review the memories they wish to create for the holidays. We spent two hours of our Christmas Day trying to get this noisy supposed ""spy car"" out of the box. Finally, we had to give up until the next day when the hardware store reopened. Do not buy this product unless you have a really expansive tool set and a great deal of patience."
5,Fun toy 11 yr old loves it,"We bought this for my 11 yr old for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. He is very much into spying and he has already gotten a lot of use out of this car. He will sit in one room in the house and roam the rest with the car. It's funny, and we have to laugh....he will enter a room and you can tell when he is watching you because the car will get into a position and just sit there and look at you. I'll be in bed at night and hear the car roaming my room just looking around. Definately a very fun toy."
4,Good except staying neutral with other drivers is difficult,"The game is good and accurate, one of the only games with an actual ongoing career. My only complaints are the Craftsman Truct series is difficult to steer, and when you start a career, 10 races and everyone on the track is a ""rival"". Even your own team mates. This happens when you either hit a car lightly twice, constantly alternate between two positions for a long time, or obviously if you wreck him. The third one makes sense. The second one makes a little sense because you could tell he's getting impatient, but I mean come on, I'm sure every Sprint Cup driver has lightly bumped each car at least 3 times and they don't go all violent. If there's any future 2013/2014 NASCAR PSP games, remove ally/neutral/rival please"
1,REMAKES: AWFUL,"I'm a casual listener and even I knew these were re-makes. They sound terrible. What an insult to package this is a way that implies original recordings. Another record label lies to the public. Hmm, time to kazaa these instead. RIP OFF!!!"
4,The Canterbury Papers,"I really liked this book, because of its historical accuracy and detail. It had a very good story line. The character was believable and interesting. I especially liked the authors descriptive, colorful scenes that she painted with her words. I'm an artist and was able to visualize several of her scenes quite clearly just as if I was looking at a movie. Loraine Shue-Weber"
2,Doesn't fit the track,Bought this item and it doesn't fit the track in my table saw without my sanding down the paint on the sides of the mitre track bar
4,Tabla Fusion,"Her voice is as perfect and beautiful as ever, however the music veers a little toward cliched jazz-fusion in places and lacks the wonderful sophistication and delicacy of Qareeb.That's not to take away from an interesting and often gorgeous album.S"
3,Phantom with Billy Zane,I enjoyed this version of The Phantom also. I don't think it is quite as good as the one with Ryan Carnes. It was a little hoaky but I still enjoyed it
5,Casmpy Fun,This is a great movie if your looking for something light and fun. There is not deep thought involved in this one. Treat Williams and Billy Zane both give excellent performances and Catherine Zeta-Jones really steals the female lead even though she was supposed to be the evil female lead. If your a fan of B movies or comic movies you will enjoy this one.
2,not so good,there are lots of good people in this. and i like superhero stuff and spoof things. but somehow this just didn't work. i was very disappointed. you didn't really care whether you finished watching or not. BUT the bluray was gorgeous. it was almost tempting to keep it just to look at the gorgeous scenery - but i took it to the used dvd place for a trade in.
1,not a US dvd,My sister just got the dvd in the mail and said it would not play because its coded for region 2
4,Decent movie,"While I am well familiar with the comic book, this movie does a decent job adapting to an action movie. Sure it isn't 100% true to the original content, but what movie is? Anyway....The action scenes are entertaining, very Indiana Jones-like. The acting wasn't amazing, but decent. Others rip this movie because its a guy running around in a purple suit - well thats typical of a comic book character to me. Just go watch this movie and enjoy."
4,Nostalgic Fun for the Entire Family,"""The Phantom"" may lack the epic-scale ""Indiana Jones"" thrills, but this 1996 adaptation of Lee Falk's famous comic strip does a better job recapturing the Saturday Matinee spirit. Ideally cast as ""The Ghost Who Walks,"" Billy Zane's likable performance establishes the good-natured tone that director Simon Wincer sustains throughout this colorful adventure. Memorable villainy from Treat Williams, who brings a refreshing B-movie enthusiasm to the proceedings. Another bonus is the presence of Catherine Zeta-Jones as a fetching air pirate - two years before her breakthrough role in ""The Mask of Zorro."" Though a box-office flop when first released, ""The Phantom"" has emerged as a cult favorite on DVD while attracting new legions of viewers."
4,A Definite Grower,"Upon initial listen to Kylie's criminally underrated BODY LANGUAGE, this track stood out as one of the weaker offerings among many of the more electro-fueled tracks, despite fitting more snugly into today's musical climate(and maybe a more obvious choice as the album's first single). Several listens on and it's definitely a slow but steady grower, not as ace as the previous ""Slow"" but still pretty good, and is in fact one of only a couple of really R&B ""leaning"" tracks on the album, not to mention undoubtedly the biggest concession to current musical trends. On the other end of the spectrum, it's also one of the few tracks in which the singer provides a more full-bodied vocal as opposed to the kewpie doll cooing that's going on throughout much of the set. All in all, another solid release(although there are at least three or four better potential singles to choose from on the album)."
2,Not As Pictured,"In the picture shown, the ""Lemon"" had a golden hue to it, but when I received the towels, they were bright yellow! The texture was different, also. In the picture they had a basket weave look. Actually, they are plain woven cotton and you can see through them. Not very absorbent looking at all!"
1,poor quality,"I purchased these dish towels to print on to give as gifts, and was extremely disappointed in the quality. They are much thinner than I expected, as compared with other flour sack towels I have previously purchased. After washing one of these towels just once, the seam came undone and began to fray. Considering these will be used as kitchen towels, I assume that they should have been designed to hold up to numerous washings. I also noticed that the majority of the towels I ordered are extremely off grain, which in my opinion, cheapens the quality and makes me hesitant to give these crooked dish towels as gifts."
3,Dave's compound miter saw,I am very pleased with the limited use so far. I purchased a RIDID MS-UV utility vehicle to mount the saw on and the combination is superb for mobility. I am looking forward to installing engineered hardwood flooring and using the saw for the project.
5,garnetanwhite,"I am a cabinet and trim installer and have used this saw alot you can't ask for much better than this saw. Powerfull easy to use cuts miters lying flat at 31.6 degree sets on both compound and miter cuts, gives you the perfect miter cut each time. No more having to bed your material, just lay it down flat and cut the marks. Cuts a good twelve inches and has a usefull hold down clamp. Again for the money you can't go wrong with this saw. The only thing I wish this saw had would be a double compound option but this unit only tilts left where some other models for a few dollars more tilt both ways, but really not a big deal to me."
5,Great saw for weekend warrior,"This is a great saw. I'm a big time DIYer that often gets into trouble with my new toys. My first project was to put in 2 staircases, oak treads and risers. I wanted a good, tight fit because I didn't want to use moulding. The finished results were outstanding. My Bosch gets much (most) of the credit. Easy to use and to figure things out. Positive detents are great and the clamp is superior to all others I reviewed. This saw just plain feels good and solid."
1,refill only,this is the refill see below. it does not do what the commercial says it does. can't tell you even used it
2,Negative scan with loss of detail and color mismatch,"The features sound great. But reality is different. Negative scans look horrible, with loss of detail and color mismatch. Photo scans also show color mismatch. The document auto feeder will usually fail and produce a paper jam. What else can be said? Go for the Epson Perfection 2450."
5,Classic Doo Wop,"The Nutmegs' Greatest Hits contains their biggest hits ""Story Untold"" and ""Ship Of Love"".But the other lesser known songs are classic Doo Wop and a joy to listen to.All the songs are the original recordings and the recording quality is excellent."
4,Very good and entertaining,I was not a huge White Stripes fan basically due to lack of knowledge but I enjoyed the Blunderbuss CD so thought I would give this DVD a try and I enjoyed it.
2,"Lots of legwork, little result","I think Mr. Bell took his research notes and just make a book out of it with little editing. Most of it was ""I went here and did this. I drove here, had tea, then talked to this guy..."" . Lots of pounding the pavement and time spent, but it was hard to draw any sort of conclusion based on his information and as a writer, he should at the very least tried to tie all his information together and come up with a thesis. There is none of that here. Besides a couple of new minor details, I came away from this book no more enlightened about Houdini and the incident that allegedly caused his death than I was before."
5,Spectacular Science Fiction art,"If you are a fan of Sci-Fi films, you will love this book. Every page has one or more images of sci-fi movie posters, all in color.The text is perfect, brief and informative, and never gets in the way of the art. I highly recommend this book.--Guy P. Harrison, author ofRace and Reality: What Everyone Should Know About Our Biological Diversityand50 Reasons People Give for Believing in a God"
3,An O.K. book,"The biggest disappointment is that Greer does not write about the most interesting parts of the Monitor's history: the trip down to Hampton Roads and the battle with the Virginia. He mostly writes about his shipboard life and details his illnesses and money making schemes done to augment his pay which was not paid out to him in full thus causing financial hardship at home. Mostly of interest for its insights into a sailor's life, less so for info on the Monitor. It's a decent book to supplement other info on the Monitor but not the book to get if you get only one."
3,Incomplete but with some uses,"Not the best book by Cunningham I've ever read. While it gives some interesting ideas the encyclopedia is incomplete. It might be useful as a stepping stone but not as a definitive source of information (but isn't that why you want an encyclopedia). The most important thing to remember (that occured to me after buying this book and disagreeing with most of his associations with the stones) is that no one can tell you how an herb or stone or whatever is going to aid you. You have to work with them and discover for yourself. This book could encourage cookie cutter magic and spiritual laziness. I do enjoy the book for the thorough research he has done on the the folklore of the stones and as a starting point for making my own. Cunningham is a good author, he just can't deliver in this instance."
2,Extremely Predictable,"This is a page turner, alright; maybe the pages should be ""turned"" into a halfway decent made-for-TV movie....to be shown on Lifetime Cheannel, because my three year-old cousin could have written this drivel."
4,Riveting,"Plot is complex and surprising, a real ""page-turner"". More unusual, the moral/ethical issues are also presented with depth and complexity."
3,Interesting premise,"I liked the premise the author created--what to do with a windfall of cash. One question plagues me though--hasn't the author ever heard of a casino? Man they love wads of cash there. You can take barrel-fulls in (under $10K at a time anyway), turn it into chips, turn them back into cash, and no one will bat an eye and you'll get treated like a king to boot. I guess that's more logical but less interesting."
2,Not one of the best,"I first read this book as a teenager in the '70's and though it fascinated me (astral projection was new to me then) I found the techniques frustratingly difficult to follow. Baker uses the technique of becoming lucid while dreaming, which in itself is no easy task, and, once accomplished, projecting the consciousness to a desired location. Problem is, once I became lucid I almost always awakened, usually within 20 or 30 seconds (and sometimes sooner) thereby putting an end to my astral endeavors. Because of the poor results I got using these techniques I can't give this book more than 2 stars.However, for those people who have a knack for this particular technique of astral projection this may be what the doctor ordered."
2,Maybe think twice,"Originally written in 1969, supposedly revised in 1995, I found the book to be a bit out-dated. However, the b/w illustrations are good. Lots of (old) anecdotal stories, short on actual techniques."
3,Shame on MGM - Waste of Panavision,I agree with all of the others about the Pan and Scan travesty. One of the things I loved about this movie was the beautiful 70 mm cinematography. I couldn't wait for this to come to DVD and they ruined it. One of my favorite movies as a child. Make sure to go to [...]/dvd to let them know your displeasure. Maybe they will stop releasing poor quality versions of movies on DVD. I am giving the DVD 3 stars only so that others who have never seen it will realize that the movie itself is wonderful - 4 or 5 stars.
3,Not as good as our version,"Our school resently put on the play Tom Sawyer and I decided to see the movie to compare it to us. Although I'm the first to admit that ours wasn't the greatest, I liked it more than this movie. The film was worn giving it a low budget look and I couldn't stand the kid who played Tom."
4,not as big or dark as i thought,"i like the shape and style of the ring but i was slightly disappointed in how small it is in person compared to how it looks online, also i usually enjoy darker amethysts than this one, but overall the product came on time and i do like it."
4,Tonka Raceway - 4 year old loves it!,"I bought this for my 4 year old son. It is one of his favorites. He can design his own automobile, help customers at the service station, and even do crash tests for cars. There are other features of this game, but these are the ones he seems to enjoy the most. We couldn't figure out how the service station worked at first. We would go to the station and the attendant would scratch and look around, but nothing would happen. We finally figured out that while you are doing other activities in the program and hear a bell, then you go to the station because you have a customer. There you can change oil, fill up with gasoline, and other repairs. I would recommend this game for children between 3 and 8, although my 13 year old nephew enjoyed it for a little while himself."
1,Not as Advertised,"This CD is not specific to Navajo language and should not be sold as such. After buying it, I got an e-mail from the seller, trying to get me to buy other products (through a private paypal), I declined. When I recieved the item, it came with no informtion, or what the ""Navajo"" part of it was supposed to be. It may be a general learning aid, but to be honest, since the seller is clearly trying to sell it as a specific language learning aid, which clearly it is not, I do not trust it and do not plan to use it. Obviously someone else has decided the same, as I see it for sale used already. I only gave it one star, because Amazon doens't give me the option of ZERO stars."
3,"clunky and preposterous, but kind of fun","I sort of liked this, enough to read it through to the end, and there were parts that were pretty exciting, but I've never said, ""Oh, come ON!!"" so often as while reading this, especially during the crazy car ride through the desert in Algeria.(and we are to believe that the character of Mireille accomplished the same trip on foot and 7 months pregnant????) The historical coincidences were such a stretch, and the painfully convoluted connections between chess and religion, science, music, etc. etc. were often mystifying. I've always been willing to just suspend disbelief while reading fiction, but this was a lot of bad writing, thin characters, and superficially developed character relationships. However, the story is a fun ride; I think she just took on a bit too much..."
3,"Certainly NOT the best book ever, but an enjoyable read.","There were lots of opinions I wondered about after reading the book, the blurbs being part of them (female ""Name of the Rose"" ?? Why ?). It's a fun book, nothing to think too much about, and I think it's virtues are a bit exaggerated. There are obvious weaknesses like the historical figures who appear partly just that their names are included in the novel. The ending is not very tidy (why on earth... no, I won't spoil it, but you'll know) and there are some parts where you'll wonder if this isn't a Harlequin romance novel after all. But quite a nice read, after all."
1,Very disappointing,"LIke many other reviewers, I had high hopes for this book. The theological/historical fiction genre is my favorite. I kept pushing through this book in hopes that at some point, I would fall in love with it. No such luck. I have a hard time believing that The Eight went through a rigorous editing process. There were so many irrelevant details and characters introduced that the plot got lost along the way. Every so often there would be a paragraph where I knew I was supposed to have an ""a-ha!"" moment, but they always fell flat. The author kept alluding to upcoming intensity (""if I had only known that the next 24 hours would bring such and such"") so I'd keep reading and never find the shocking twist that was supposedly right around the corner. I really think this could have been a good book, but only if it was about 200 pages shorter and more efficiently told."
1,By far the worst book ever written,"I picked this up at a local grocery store for a dollar. I overpaid by 100 cents. I would shred this and put it in my cat's litterbox, but that would be cruel because he deserves to defecate on something better.This book has a DaVinci Code like plot through the eys of historical characters and through the present to the books heroine. And you must be on heroin if you want to get to the last page. If you are a simple minded conspiracy nut job then this book might appeal to you, but only if you've head a frontal lobatomy."
4,An exciting adventure,"I happened upon The Eight in the most interesting way. I was backpacking across Europe and on route to Greece, I met a nice young man reading The Eight. He passed his copy to me as soon as he was through with it. I was quite surpirsed at how much I enjoyed this book. I read it through the rest of my journies. It is full of excitement, passion and intrigue. It is a very entertaining book, and am very greatful to the kind architect student who passed it on to me.Katina"
2,Skip it,"The Eight wasn't bad, but comparing it to Brown's The Da Vinci Code is simply not fair to the latter. The plot is nowhere near as intricate or exciting. Not quiet as well-researched, either. If nothing else (and there was plenty), I assure you, nobody received a ""special education"" in the Pioneer's Palace in the USSR. It's like saying that somebody was specially educated at the Boy Scouts. The two stories are disconnected till the last couple of pages. Some of the scenes and dialogue smacked of Danielle Steel.Overall, I found it rather underwhelming.Given the wealth of excellent books out there, I wouldn't recommend it."
2,"Plot-driven, poorly written, lame ending","I almost put this book down after the first chapter because the writing style turned me off. I decided to give it a second chance and got hooked by the plot. It reminded me a lot of the DaVinci Code, but wasn't quite as suspenseful and started to drag about halfway through. I liked the historical details, but was disappointed by the ending."
4,Loved This Book!,"Long before there was a DaVinci Code, there was The Eight. The novel mixes elements of history and science fiction with some chess thrown in for fun. In many ways, the novel is a throwback to B-movie thrillers, but the author has a way of making you forget that with interesting historical background and a different take on the ""immortality"" genre. My only complaint is that the ending seems rushed and falls flat. If you liked The DaVinci Code, then The Eight is right up your alley. This would make a fantastic movie for a strong actress and I've often wondered why no one has ever picked it up. Unfortunately, the author has never written anything up to this par since."
2,Just another book,"The really good thing about this book is the end, the rest of the book it really doesn't have any sense, but to understand the end you have to read the book, don't waist your time with this one."
5,"A Real Dazzler, if a Bit Fantasy Inspired!","Where are the legendary chess pieces, the ones that may open the door for the always hidden holy grail!? Are a group of French nuns right before the 1789 Revolution on the road to this amazing clue that may answer the questions of history and philosophy, perhaps Christianity itself?! You won't know till you read this lengthy, fun, connect the dots fantasy that weaves the lives of a present day computer whiz kid (much like author we may presume) and the mysterious exploits of nuns and many others (including historical personages like the painter JL David, among many others). So relax by the fireside and dig into this minor masterpiece for a trip thru some strange and wild journeys through time!"
5,Loved it almost 20 years ago and still love it!,"I read this book (recommended by an engineer friend) in 1989....yes that's almost 20 years ago. I really enjoyed the intrigue, the plot, the splash of historical figures, the plot, the characters were fresh and unique oh and the plot is amazing. I noticed it on the Customer Service desk at a local bookstore and snatched it up quickly and whipped through the 600 pp in a few days. I knew the outcome, but had forgotten alot of the details. I enjoyed it all over again and kept waiting for the climactic ending. This book is very well written altho some of the physics went over my head in 89 and again in 08. lolI have already gotten 3 other friends to purchase the book so we can have a discussion on it.Just as good as it was in 89. Go for it. It's a wild thrill ride."
5,Could I recommend this book more?,"I enjoy reading all genres of books, from sci-fi to military adventure, historical romances to classical literature. And I tell you, this is the book I would want to have with me if I was stranded on a deserted island. This IS my favorite book of all time. For someone who is not a big historical buff, the historical timeline is so engaging and so intricately woven with the present timeline that a wonderful tapestry unfolds. For a book with such an excellent plot, it is not entirely plot-driven but has carefully developed characters that actually create the story around them. A tale of history, intrigue, politics, love, risk, adventure, power, family - it has everything bound in one incredible story. If I was allowed to recommend only one book - this would be it. What more can I say? :)"
2,Poor design,"This is a cheap pedometer. I can't speak for how well it works because it broke less than 10 minutes after I opened it. Setting it up was relatively easy. There are no labels on the casing. So once it was clipped shut, I had no way as easily identifying which side to open from. Sure enough, I opened up the wrong side and exposed circuitry. I snapped it back shut, but now it doesn't work.It was my mistake to open the wrong side. But that would not have happened if the casing was clearly marked. How hard can it be to clearly identify the side to open? How about using some labels?Let this be a warning when opening up this pedometer to check the readout. If you try the wrong side, it opens too easily and never works again. Poor design."
1,the same exact record as global underground 2,i purchased global underground 002 a few months back...i loved it...dont get me wrong this is a great disc but i now own two of them because global undegournd repackaged an old cd and gave it a new name - that is wrong
4,"Excellent, but I've heard better","Definitely one of my favorite global undergrounds, the track ""rescue me"" takes me back years ago when I used to travel with my family. That one track, is worth getting the entire album in my opinion. But don't get me wrong, both discs are phenomenal. However, my ears are spoiled-and I've heard better.as far as Oakenfold's music goes, this is his BEST work...This Global Underground has been a favorite of mine for many years, so much that I bought another copy(when I lost my original)."
2,No,"I really like Paul Oakenfold, but this CD is lame. Don't even waste your time on this one. All his other CD's are good though...just not this one ;-/"
3,"Not bad, not great","This CD is about average. A few of the tracks are great, Children, You're not alone, Beautiful Day and the Flower Duet 99 is classic. Some of the other tracks just don't seem to fit on the CD. Still, I listen to it a lot, but tend to replay just a few tracks rather than the whole disc. Buy it used."
3,The nightmare becomes reality!,"It is only a matter of time before a needless sequel to a cult smasheroo is produced. Phantasm 2 picks up the story ten years after the 'events' of the first film (this being made in 1988, ten years after Phantasm 1) with an overlapping prelude and some catch up with the surviving characters. Quickly the movie settles into the chase thriller format, with Reggie and Mike's hunt uncovering town after town destroyed by the Tall Man. Writer/director Don Coscarelli both retells the story and expands the scope of the first film, but the results, while certainly atmospheric, are mixed. In the end P2 is nothing more than a stylish, more plot focused retread, rather than expansion, of the Phantasm mythos. Fans may find it worth a look, first timers should stick with the first film."
4,Phantasm II,"Probably the Best Phantasm Sequel to me despite Mikey from Part 1 not being in it, and as in every movie it picks off where it left.this version though gets more gross but still remains scary which to me is what makes ""The Tall Man"" and Phantasm 1 the best of all and I find this one while not perfect,it keeps up with that formula."
4,"Universal, on the cheap","Although I DON'T usually have a problem with Universal dvd's.....apart from the fact that some of their TV series box sets freeze occasionally.....this disc is an exception. Pity that they did not allow Anchor Bay to release this one. I would have liked to see a commentary track, deleted & extended scenes, documentaries...MAYBE even a dvd-rom for the original shooting script. STILL it is nice to have this on dvd and not on the worn and shaky full-screen vhs print that I had before. James LeGros was ok as Mike, but Don Coscarelli should have gotten Michael Baldwin to play him. Consistency is key to us fans"
3,Not so Obscure Anymore,These guys have been around in the UK quite a while and is just making their US debut this month via a TV spot with Mitsubishi... watch for the Mitsubishi spot where a girl on the passenger seat is 'popping' to 'Days Go By'.
4,Snow White and more,"It has kept them (and several cousins before them) happily occupied and singing for hours. Without driving the parents crazy! Actually, we all sing the songs together now."
5,Rory At His Best,"A must for every Rory fan and guitar player. Five stars is not enough. Once again Rory shows us all that he was the best. I saw him several times in the late 70's and 80's, but never in the 90's. It almost brought tears to my eyes when I saw how ill he looked in 94 just before his death. But even though he looked ill, he still played like an animal!"
2,Rare but not so good,"These Chaplins from 1914 are not readily available on disc elsewhere, to my knowledge, but the print quality varies from barely acceptable to pretty awful - worse than lousy VHS, anyway. At least one item appears to be taken from a download, with 'block' pixellation and very variable contrast. The (jerky) text commentaries re Chaplin before some of the films is gushing, poorly executed and not a little irritating, particularly considering that these are collector's items not likely to need this sort of interruption. There is no information with the disc except titles, and some of these are at odds with those displayed on the films - one 'Star Border', is an obvious misspelling. For my money this disc seems unremarkable value, and I would be cautious about buying others in the 'The Actors' series."
5,My spirit was awakened!,"Cheb Mami is, by far, the most intoxicating voice of Rai. Each song enlivens the senses, and his vocal ability awakens my spirit. The album is like a journey of the soul. It is difficult to choose a favorite song among this album. But, if I did, it would have to be Ana Mazel. (Forgive me if the spelling is incorrect.) That piece exemplifies his soaring vocal ability, and the soulfulness of the entire album. My only sorrow is the shortness of the album, and the scarcity of Rai music where I live. Before the internet, it was next to impossible to find such wonderful artists as Cheb Mami (in the midwest). If you love this album and Cheb Mami's other works, as I do,I also recommend Cheb Khaled. Although his voice is not as vibrant as Mami, he, too, evokes the true spirit of Rai in every song."
3,crappy charger,"Love the gun, but the batteries wont hold a charge. I dont know if it is defective or what. I am in the process of finding that out. The gun itself was great for the first day, now we cant even play with it because of the batteries or charger."
4,Some mistakes not the fault of the author.,"Sometimes not being able to work a pattern doesn't mean the book has a mistake. For instance, p.139 ""Butterfly"" does not have different numbers of stitches on each row. Notice that ""Embossed Hearts"" on the same page ends each row differently worded than does ""Butterfly."" If not read carefully, ""Butterfly"" would seem to say do the repeat as many times as required, then knit #. But it says to ""end last rep k#."" So the last repeat of each row ends with a different number of knit stitches than the other repeats in the row. I counted it out and it works.I also checked several more throughout the book in response to another review that said the first row always required more stitches than were cast-on. In the couple dozen that I checked, none were wrong.I understand this book has errors. But we must not be blind to our own and instead blame the author."
3,GO TO vogueknitting.com for corrections,I too fell in love with all of the opportunities this book seems to offer. But once I tried to knit the scarf on the cover I ran into 2 typos in the first 6 rows. The corrections can be found online at: vogueknitting.com under corrections. I was very frustrated and now not to excited to try and knit another project from the book.
1,Deep Throat Sucks for Real,This copy of Deep Throat is not like the original. When it comes to the XXX parts it gose into a multi screen that cuts out all hard core activity.
1,who comes up with this stuff?,"If this story were not so off-the-wall and the main girl not so obnoxious, it might have worked. As it is, it's just weird and annoying. Don't get this movie."
1,NOT AVAILABLE!! (not even for download),"Don't bother clicking the links for 'mp3 download'. They redirect you to a whole other product (not even Springsteen related). This cd (or the music contained) is not available anywhere except through private sellers (around $100).Unfortunately, unlike the other reviewer, I bought the dvd years ago from a retailer. No cd included, just the dvd which, of course, only features edited versions of the songs. No extras.Where's my apology, Columbia Records?"
2,Disagree with NJRockets review,"It is ludicrous to even mention the fact that The Duprees have lasted so long and can still be seen in Atlantic City considering the fact that there is not one original member of the Duprees in the group that is seen in Atlantic City. This is a major problem with many groups purporting to be from the 50's and 60's. The Duprees appearing today is a perfect example of caveat emptor ... buyer beware for those readers who don't read Latin! For those of us who were Duprees fans, this is a not to be missed CD of the original Duprees with the incomparable sound of Joey Vann and harmony that is hard to match. They did Joni James proud in their remake of a number of her hits. It is nostalgia personified hearing the original Duprees."
5,life changing,"I originally read this book when my girls were small and it changed the way I raised them. I'm sure that some of the references are now dated, but, the original concepts of raising non sexist children are as valid today as they were then. Even if you don't agree with all the viewpoints, it will certainly make you more aware each time you purchase a toy or make any decision that affects a child."
5,What the UK media say,"New Scientist, 10 November, 2001This is a book that all managers should read...It explodes the paperless myth, and highlights the strengths and weakenesses of electronic paper-based systems.The Guardian, 26 November, 2001If you wish to read anything at all on office management, read this book"
1,Doesn't work at all,I wrestled with this thing for an hour before putting it back in the box and returning it. It doesn't lock. What a disappointment.
2,A fake?,"The watch looks quite simple, even cheap. This is my third Tissot watch and the worst.Very disappointed with the seller - 3 days to wait for the shipping and even worse - there was no Tissot label tag with price and bar code on the watch! Is it a fake? I don't know..."
1,Dissapointed,"This watch is practically too small even for my 4'11 girlfriend. I am about 6'1 and I'm terribly dissapointed at how petite this watch is. Makes my forearms look gigantic. I feel like I got a size extra small. Honestly have been looking at this watch for almost a year. When the price dropped I had to get it. Extremely dissapointed, this watch might look good on a 13 year old girl, but other then that, don't bother gents. I'm about to write tissot and complain. Anyone else have this problem?"
4,Too much of a good thing,"This is a quality watch; well made and attractive. But, if you are like me, and not beefy with Popeye-sized forearms and wrists, you will feel like Flava Flave."
2,"Great looking watch, but don't buy to keep time accurately","I bought this watch about a year ago. It is a great looking watch no doubt. I was surprised to see that the watch would gain 2-3 min per day! I took the watch back to Macy's where I purchased it, and was told that automatic watches are known for inaccuracy, and 1 minute/day is not unheard of. I called Swiss Army (Victorinox) and they said that they could recalibrate the watch under warranty. I sent the watch in for recalibration, and approximately 8 weeks later the watch was sent back to me. Now the watch runs slow about 2 minutes per day. When you purchase a watch for close to $1000 you expect that the watch will be accurate without daily adjustments.I have finally thrown in the towel and just purchased a Movado Series 800 SubSea watch, that is Quartz based and looks fantastic.If you are ok with constantly resetting your watch, you will be happy, but if you don't want to be late to meetings, etc, then this watch is not for you."
4,A nice relief from a hot summer,"Overall I am very satisfied with this portable air conditioner.The Good:-Shipping was extremely fast (2 days for standard shipping).-Installation was a breeze.-The air that comes out is actually cold, and powerful. The fan produces a terrific draft of cool air.-It cools the room quickly.-The evaporative draining system is great... no emptying buckets of water constantly!The Bad:-It does make some noise (no more than a normal window air conditioner would). But I would say the relief from a hot, humid day is well worth the buzzing noise.-The exhaust hose was larger than I expected. Which means if you don't place the air conditioner strategically, it can be a huge eye sore in the room.However, it does do its job well and I would recommend this unit to anyone needing to cool a room/dorm/small apartment. Enjoy!"
2,Dull,I'm pretty much the ideal reader for a book like this -- I'm interested in the subject. But the writing never grabbed me -- I am a fairly lazy reader. I got through a few chapters and then it lay on my bedside table for weeks.
3,"a lot of history, too little technology","This is a well-researched and -written account, containing most if not all key people and events, of early radar development. However, the author could have gone deeper into the key technical aspects and allow the average reader to better appreciate how significant those advancements were."
2,universal smog fitting,Product worked as I thought it would. Problem: the shipping was 10 times the cost of the part.
5,"La recomiendo, Mcbo Venezuela","Esta fuente de poder tiene una presentacion del producto excelente todos sus accesorios y calidad del producto intachable, luce perfecto en mi case con pared acrilica."
3,A good summer read,"A real page-turner! Believable characters, and a plot whose twists and turns held my interest throughout. Be warned though... it's pretty gory! The author is skillful enough to move things along so fast that you don't stop to notice the gaping holes in logic (reservation tapes on a 2-week backup cycle that are erased in less than 10 days, and an FBI-sponsored burglary that makes no sense if you stop to think about it). And the retired teacher in me was appalled at the errors in grammar and spelling: ""pouring"" over reports... clothes on ""hangars"" ... wounds full of ""puss"" ... computer tapes are ""overridden"". Sigh! Spellcheckers aren't enough, folks!"
5,Great read!,"For those of us with a rather short attention span and who are wrapped up in the addiction of endurance/adventure sports, this book is awesome! It's so fascinating how the body does ""survive the extremes"". A great read all around :)"
1,lens cover was stuck,"It looked like a nice camera and it was lightweight, but as soon as I put the batteries in and turned it on, the lens cover would not open. I had to return it."
2,Mine Was a Dud I Guess...,"This camera performed beautifully. It took great pix, and I had ZERO complaints. Then, only four months after buying it, it inexplicably stopped working. None of the buttons functioned and I'm not spending at least half the cost of the camera to get it fixed. But if repairs don't bother you, it really was a great camera."
3,S-L-O-W,"Great image quality in ""regular lighting"" situations...but waiting for the flash in between shots is INCREDIBLY SLOW. I'm very disappointed in the actual recyling time of the flash, and even of the preview from picture to picture....I picked this camera because of the compact-ish size and the features it has for the price.....but if I was able to borrow someone's to test it, I wouldn't have spent the money...I'd keep looking if I were you....."
3,OK,"I have so many problems whenever I ask someone to take my picture. They either can't figure out how to hold the button down to take the picture and try to tell me the camera doesn't work or return the camera to me thinking they took the picture when they didn't. Or they take an out of focus picture. This is a major problem if you travel or like taking pictures with your friends.This camera eats up batteries so fast! It takes 2 AA batteries, yet it seems like I'm replacing them every week!You can't take continuous pictures because the camera needs like 15 seconds after you take the picture to recover. Trust me that seems like an eternity sometimes.All in all I don't feel my photos are as sharp as my pictures from film."
4,Very Versatile for the Price (Don't Pay $399 though!),PROS:1) Very versatile for the price (Don't Pay $399 though - I paid about 165). I've had my camera for just over a year.2) Good entry level digitial camera or for those transitioning to the digital world.3) I'm quite satisfied with the quality for the price.4) My main need was to be able to use the camera much the way I was accustomed to using my film-based Nikon 35mm. I like to experiment with f-stops and shutter speeds but I like the ability to hand over the camera to anyone for use as a PHD push-here-dummy camera. The average person was too intimidated by my Nikon 35mm with the bells & whistles.CONS:Get a much larger SD card immediately. The one provided is tiny.The A530 is smaller but has fewer features - go figure!?
1,Works poorly with Windows XP,"The Cannon Software that comes with this camera is not very user-friendly.I personaly have had a horrible nightmare with the software and currently Canon Tech support is unable to remedy the problem.Picture quality, the ""standard"" setting takes pictures that are very ""overexposed"" or white looking.Must have add-ons .... the 16mb memory card included only holdl hold 8 to 15 4 mpeg pictures.You need to buy rechargeble 2500 mah batteries, standard batteries will take about 20 pictures with flash on.Overall unsatisfied customer, i only paid xxx.xx and i believe that was too much.Best wishesMatt"
1,Fatal E18 error after a few hours of use,"We bought this camera for our 15 year old daughter after having very positive experiences with other Canon cameras. It died with the ""E18"" error on Christmas Day after she had taken a few dozen pictures. I then Googled Canon and E18 and discovered just how common this problem is. I guess Canon is cutting some design/manufacturing corners. Too bad since their cameras take great pictures. I guess I'll be sending this camera back under the warranty and hoping for the best..."
3,Paradise or Politics?,"While I enjoyed Mr. Masson's descriptions of the physical attributes of New Zealand his political persuasions were more than crystal clear. He blames everything he finds wrong in America on conservative values and politics. Perhaps Mr. Masson should realize that the things he finds wrong with New Zealand: lack of intellectual thinking, rampant child abuse etc. are a product of the socialist system. There is nowhere to go and nothing to strive for in a socialist system. A system where you can never have the opportunity for achievement crushes the human spirit. Paradise a country that takes 65% of your income??!!! I guess he is wealthy enough to hand over that much of his income while still traveling through Europe, Asia, and the U.S. for a quarter of the year! I guess New Zealand sounds like somewhere I sure would like to visit but I wouldn't want to live there."
1,Waste of Time,"This book isn't about New Zealand, it's about the author and his laundry list of intellectual and professional accomplishments. It's self-important drivel disguised as a travel book and his pretentious rhetoric is anything but New Zealand."
1,slipping into a pile of b.s.,"my husband and i liked this book when we read it, while preparing to move from california to auckland. but our opinion changed once we settled into our home, which is, ironically, just around the corner from mr. masson's. we were a little surprised to find the humble beach house he described in the book prominently featured in a nz architecture magazine, along with the story of how masson had the original shambling beach house carted away before interviewing several architects to construct a multi-million-dollar ""eco-home"" on the ocean-front site. in this and many other areas, masson's non-fiction book is anything but. he enjoys a lifestyle very few average kiwis can attain, and has the audacity to support that lifestyle by pretending it is accessible to anyone. Shameless."
1,A waste of money,"This book bills itself as an equal to ""A Year in Provence"" or ""Under the Tuscan Sun."" IT IS NOT!!! It is filled overwhelmingly with the author's political diatribes. Don't bother spending your $$ on this book."
4,Great boxing game,"Pretty fun boxing game to play. Except graphics everything is perfect. Story mode is also fun... Even though you are not a fan of the original manga, you will enjoy it as long as you like boxing game... it has much faster action than FNC."
2,Does not have unique serial number,If you are planning to use more than one of these adapters on a machine it does NOT seem to provide a unique serial number. So there doesn't seem to be a way to create a stable mapping between a specific hardware adapter and assigned serial device. udevinfo on Linux reports each hardware device has an iSerial of 0.
5,This little gadget saved my day.,"I am in love with my old BTC mini-keyboard, but unfortunately it has the old style PS/2 connection. My new computer offers only USB ports. So I was stuck with a lousy second-rate keyboard that made double-characters or skipped characters at whim.I ordered a new keyboard from Amazon. Lucky for me, I also ordered this little gadget, in hopes that if the new keyboard was not satisfactory, I could use my beloved BTC mini with this converter.The new keyboard was far more disappointing than I ever imagined possible (see my review). I simply cannot use it. So I plugged this converter into a USB port (without turning my computer off first!), plugged in my old BTC, and BOOM.... it works. Perfectly. I am so happy! I love this old BTC mini, and I've never found any keyboard to come close to it's feel and ease of use. This gadget allows me to use it again. I'm very pleased."
5,Works for me!,"I was about to return the Logitech Media Keyboard because it had a PS2 connection When it hit me, check and see if there is a PS2/USB converter.and lo and behold after reading some reviews I chose the TRENDnet. I am now enjoying my keyboard."
2,version 3.3.x.x drivers were consistently BSOD-ing my Windows 7 x64,"3.3 drivers (Win 7 x64 Update-included) were consistently BSOD-ing my machine - after 3 hours of uptime.I had to find newer drivers on a well-hidden from search engines Prolific (original chip manufacturers') page.Now running well for the last 2 days on driver 3.4.36.247 dated 7/26/2012.Prolific identification utility identifies chip as ""PL-2303 HXD""."
4,It works,Have tried at least three different cables for my garmin legend this is the only one that works. It was what I expected. It does not seem to charge the or power the unit though. Otherwise hey a product that works.
1,Don't be fooled by the 4 star rating,This $10 RS-232 DB-9 to USB cable works as well as the $0.75 cable I bought from another seller; it doesn't. I'm not quite sure I can fully express my utter dissatisfaction with this turn of events.
1,Chris L,"I am an IT engineer with 30-years of experience.I purchased the TrendNET TU-S9 from Amazon.I am running win 7 32-bit on a brand new HP Elite Book 8440pI have updated the driver from the latest one provided on the TrendNet site.After 3-5 minutes of use this adapter blue screens my PC. I have not had any problems prior or since, however every single time I utilize the TU-S9 within 3-5 minutes my laptop Blue Screens.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT if you plan on using it on the latest (with patches) version of Windows 7."
2,Did not work in my Windows 7/64(pro),"Despite advertised claims, I was unable to obtain drivers that would work on my Windows 7/64 laptop. Trendnet support was awful. I've included quotes from two emails from 'tech support'. Their initial response was ""We just tested the installation on a Win7 64 system and had no issues using the CD that came with the unit."". When I asked for more detail to try to resolve it they replied ""Unfortunately, we cannot troubleshoot you computer or OS."" That was the final reply. I tried the CD, downloaded drivers from Trendnet and from Prolific. The hardware itself was not defective(tested it on XP sp3).It and the drivers might work on some W7/64 machines (per earlier reviews) but not on all.I was fortunate in buying it through Amazon. The return/refund is already in process. I gave it 2 stars instead of 0 because it did work well on XP - just not on W7/64."
1,Does not work for most of our computers,"This converter did not work for most of our Intel computers (Xeon E7330 @ 2.40GHz ""Tigerton"", linux 2.6.24).On the other hand, the converter did work on a few Intel computers (Xeon E7330 @ 2.40GHz ""Tigerton"", linux 2.6.26) through a PS2 KVM switch.The problem was in the converter because, we have a different converter with does make everything work when the different converter is in the same place."
5,Must Have,"This ps/2 to USB converter solved my problems when I hooked it up to my laptop. I haven't tested it with a KVM switch yet, but this is a must have when you don't want to use the trackpad or keyboard built into your laptop."
5,PS2 mouse worked with Asus notebook,Had fellows mouse with Ps2 plug didn't work on first ps2 plug tried second one and it worked perfectly. I guess the other was for the keyboard.
3,tabs obstructed easy install,"OK product..had to cut off the tabs on the serial end to fit the devices I need it for..otherwise, ok."
1,Junk,"Arrived DOA. I also don't understand why I need to install a driver for a cable, but I installed the included driver and ever tried other drivers reccomeded by Vista and none worked. Would not work with a variety of drivers on XP either. Not worth shipping back for $11.00."
1,Strictly Junk - Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought this device to use with a Suunto scuba computer interface. It would not communicate to my serial device. The best I could tell, this device will only work on certain kinds of serial interfaces. The documentation mentioned something about serial modems. Who in the world still has or uses a serial modem??It is very unlikely that this device will allow your serial device to communicate through a USB port."
1,Technical support sucks,"I have no reason to doubt all the other reviews that say this product works fine.However, I needed to know how to write a program that uses this converter. I was disappointed that the user's manual doesn't say anything about how to program it. So I called tech support. The first person I talked to didn't even understand my question; he kept thinking it was a question about installation. He finally referred me to someone in manufacturing. When he called back, all he could say is ""We don't document that, so we don't support it"". I tried to explain to him that someone there knows how to answer my question since they distribute code along with the converter that does this. All he could do is recite the same thing.So if you think you might need technical support that involves something more than someone reading the manual to you, don't buy this."
5,My wife,"My wife has taken correctol, the brand name, bisacodyl 5 mg. IT is no longer made by correctol. I bought the Bisacodyl through Amazon and so far they have been working, she says. She had tried other, Cvs, walmart,dollar general etc. and they did not work.I will be ordering them from you again, hopefully. Please email me a link to order them when I need to. Thank you Morton Wolfson"
2,Alright if you get it for $1 or less!,"The 128 page book didn't take long to go through since about half of the book is photos. Now, the unusual fences pictured at the beginning aren't the ones they attempt to give instructions to build. The instructions to build an average fence are vague, leaving me with questions after I was done with the section. I'm glad only paid under $1 for the used book, of course that is before shipping."
5,It's so hard to find jazz lovers these days...,"When you listen to music like this, it defines the true meaning of Beauty. One who enjoys nature and is open-minded, would expose themselves to such beauty. Paul Hardcastle has been another inspiration in my life, because he plays so peacefully and romantically. Helen Rogers proves this from her unique vocals. How delicious things songs are: Shine, Feel the breeze, Lost Summer, Paradise Cove and (Lost in Space) speaks for itself. I just wonder why Paul didn't include Blue Days and Summer Rain. Well, one thing for sure, you won't be seeing George Washington's face in the garbage after making your purchase. So, you might as well relax, and let the smooth sounds of Paul Hardcastle take you away...P.S: Imagine what the world would be like if everybody listened to these kind of songs and at the same time enjoyed them... I would suppose Peace On Earth..."
3,Just Okay,"I've heard Paul Hardcastle and Jazzmasters for years on XM and Sky.FM and his music always gets my attention. I was motivated to buy one of each and chose this and Hardcastle 5 based on the many 5 star reviews here on Amazon.The first time I listened to this one I thought 'too much sax' and banished it to the console. I've since pulled it out on road trips and it's nice but there are a few songs that, like the ones with singing on Hardcastle 5, are simply irritating. I'm sure this coarse description will bring more than a few derisive snorts, but the riff gets too high, like the musician is improvising and tried for something edgy. It comes off as grating and immature.I'd recommend downloading individual songs instead of paying for the whole CD, because on both this and HC5, less than half of the total songs made the cut to my personal mp3 player."
4,Find out for yourself what you think...,"I will be the first to admit that I rely heavily on Video Game websites to find out what games are good and what games aren't that good. This game received negative press on most of those websites and so I was hesitant to play it. A friend let me play it and I found it very enjoyable. Most of the reviews I have read complain that the controls are awkward compared to the consoles but of course they are going to be different, you are playing a PSP not a PS2 or Xbox with two analog sticks.I didn't find the controls difficult and I think this game is really fun. I like figuring out the different puzzles and the graphics are amazing. Another good thing is there is a lot of replay value because you can search for hidden medallions and hold time trials.All in all, I was glad I found out for myself that this game is REALLY good."
2,Not what I hoped for,"I am an avid CSI Fan, and I guess I was hoping for something a little more interactive. You lose points if you talk to your CSI ""buddy"" and if you miss one piece you get stuck and have to go completely back through everything. I beat the game and sold it the next day.... only 5 cases and once you complete them, there really isn't anything else to the game. Buy used or rent.. don't waste too much money. This game can be completed in a day."
3,"CSI Feel, clunky on the DS","This game has the CSI feel, but is very clunky point and click on the DS. I really enjoyed the Wii CSI game which has different cases than this one, but to me it was a more enjoyable gaming experience. If you have the option to play/buy the Wii game instead of this one that would be my reccomdenation."
2,Hard game at least for me!,"I decided to buy this game after I finished all my Phoenix Wright and Apollo Justice games, I really like investigation type of games and since I really love the CSI series, I decided to go and give this game a try. I really think this game is very hard. I just can't figure out where to go next, or what tool to use on what, to collect evidence. I started using the walkthrough to help me out but it just gets to the point where you have to use it all the time, and playing like this is just not fun to me. I have also played Hotel Dusk and really enjoyed it but to me this game does not resemble hotel dusk at all. Very frustrating!"
5,Definite page turner,"If you like drama, then this book is definitely for you. It's fast pace, full of surprise & and a shocking ending."
5,TEN THUMBS UP,"The Kiss of Judas is a spectacular book. The author creates many themes in the book that relates to everyday life. This book will keep you in suspense. You won't be able to put this book down for a second. This book is an inspiration to those who are or those who have been in similar situations. This book describes how a man that was turning his life over to God, got interupted by the evil works of Satan. I would reccomend this book to any and everyone because its deep and very very interesting. I couldn't take my eyes off it for one second and that's why I gave it Ten Thumbs up. The author is awesome and I hope to see this book turned into a movie."
4,Best compilation so far,"This compilation of the multi-media artist Mac Davis is the best to appear so far. While often thought of as a country artist, much of his material was more pop-oriented. Many of his recordings charted higher pop than country.This collection of twenty tracks contains most of his hits but is limited to his Columbia recordings and contains none of his output from his Casablanca years such as 1980's ""It's Hard To Be Humble"".Sound quality is very good with all tracks in true stereo. Included is an eight-page booklet with a brief musical history, track details and a few pics. Not comprehensive but this new collection takes the top honors as a Davis compilation among those to appear so far."
1,"Good, but the format makes it somewhat useless.","I'm not sure who's choice it was - the author's or the editor's, but whoever decided not to put any verse references in this book really limited the usefulness of this otherwise good book.Pretty much the only way to find what passage he is talking about is to just keep reading until he actually mentions the contents of a verse. Very difficult and time consuming - if I had known this I would not have purchased the book. It's simply a waste of time.I did appreciate how he doesn't make this a technical commentary filled with quotations from all the older German authors. It's designed to be a commentary for the layman. If this book had had proper verse references in it, I would have given it a 4 or 5 star rating. The content is very good, but the lack of verse references makes it otherwise unusable."
2,not ideal for large breasts,"This bra is comfortable, however, not very supportive. I would use this bra for walking and weight lifting. I do not recommend this bra for running or any high intensity sports."
5,"A beautiful, funny-sad book","I loved this book. Clark Greene has created an unusual memoir that entertains and engages like fiction. On the shores of Lake Erie in the 1950's, Clark and Patch grow up together, sharing a myriad of adventures, often with startling outcomes. Pairing witty insight with exceptional memory, Mr. Greene has eloquently captured the heart of a boy and his dog. Clark Malcolm Greene has a true gift for storytelling."
3,"A remarkable journey through an ""El-nino"" ravaged landscape.","This novel explores some of the psychological and social effects of a severe ""global-warming,"" and how several scientists set out to reverse the process that has destroyed the eco-system as we have come to know it. I read this novel as a teen, and found it to be of interest to anyone who has a thirst for metorlogical mayhem. The sub-plots are typical, but overall it made a fun and interesting read. What would you do if you had to deal with 122 degree weather for more than a week?"
3,A little disappointing,"This was a little disappointing to me. I have Tracey's first book ""Frugal Luxuries"" and totally love that. I do not like this one as much."
4,I want my children reading this book.,"I bought two of these books as baby gifts for friends. The Story Bible was recommended to me by a father of a three-year-old, who has read through this bible several times with his daughter. The reason this particular Story Bible is so appealing is because it makes the Bible into a single narrative, instead of compartmentalizing it into a grouping of sweet children's stories. The author of this book seemed to want children to understand that the Bible is not a history book, rather a tale of God's salvation through Jesus Christ. I was impressed by every page I read, although the illustrations were not as appealing as I would have liked. Great buy!"
5,Captivating!,"My kids didn't want me to put it down....the same Bible stories they've heard 100 times, but in an exciting, fresh new way. The illustrations are magnificent. Truly a unique piece of work."
5,Great for young learners,"I teach kindergarten and this book has been a huge blessing. The students I teach have very low English proficiency and they just can't focus well without a lot of visuals. The Big Picture Bible has illustrations that cover the entire page and also is a good bit larger than other kids Bibles making it a great tool to use with larger groups. I would recommend this Bible to anyone looking for a good children's Bible, but particularly for teachers looking for a good way to share Bible stories with their classes."
4,Works for me!,This makeup seems to be the right thickness and coverage for me and as I'm getting closer to my 50's I can use all the help I can get!
5,One of my favorite movies!,Just love it! Has a great message for live: Your future is not written!This movie makes me feel possitive about myself.. I can watch it over and over!
5,Get the whole DVD set from Amazon.co.uk if u have a region free player. they have all the extra features on that one too 1 price,"Amazon.co.uk has an (ultimate edition) Back to the future trilogy set that has way more features than these 3 sets combined without paying for all three dvds seperate. also the coverart is awesome. You have to have a region free dvd player to play it on though or it will not work on anything except united kingdom but it is well worth buying a region free dvd player for future movies like this. it is going for around 25.00 to 30.00 at the moment which is well worth it only if you live in the US you have to pay shipping buying from amazon.co.uk and it takes awhile longer but for the more extra features listed, I believe its worth it. Plus you dont have to worry about 3 dvd boxes. they are displayed nicely in one dvd case. 4 discs."
5,Excellant Movie!,"Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd do a excellant job playing the parts of Marty McFly (Michael) and Doctor Emmit Brown (Christopher).On a scale of 1 to 100 I'd give it a 1,000."
5,Why?,"That means why hasen't this been released on DVD yet? This is one of the best movies ever, whats taking so long Zemeckis? I hope when they relase it on DVD it is like an ""Ultimate Back to the Furture DVD Collection"", with all three great time-traveling movies. And I hope it will be loaded with special features like: interviews with the cast, deleted scenes, scenes never seen before and all the works. These were three great, inavative, timeless movie classics. With a great cast including Michael J. Fox as Marty Mcfly and Christopher Llyod as Doc Brown. But we've waited 15 years for this I guess we can wait a little longer can't we? If you have any info on the release of this please e-mail me."
3,"Love the movie, just not Amazon's instant video...","I'm willing to try just about anything once, so I downloaded this for $10 from Amazon's instant video section. It was quick and easy, but a red flag went up when I saw that it was a .wma (Windows Media)and only 2.3GB. A DVD file is normally around 4GB, so this was twice as compressed and used a mediocre file format. WMA is fine for making youtube videos and homemade slideshows, but its very bad for compressing professional video. It would freeze up every 10 minutes or so, and then suddenly rocket forward to catch up with where it should have been. I normally don't have this problem with other formats. I believe it has something to do with keyframes. Anyways, knowing what I know now, I would just get the DVD/Blueray. You pay the same price, but you can use it on any device with a DVD/Blueray drive, and you can rip it to a quality unprotected file that you can use on any device (not just a kindle)."
5,Desperate!,"The Back to the Future legacy has got to my favorite set of films. They show you the risks of changing history. Being more than just a boring science-fiction story, BACK TO THE FUTURE is also fun and filled with suspense, while also having a sense of humor. I am sure I am only one of the many people who are desperate for a copy of these films on DVD. BACK TO THE FUTURE opened up the minds of its audiences. It also gave an inspiration to a generation of filmmakers and writers around the world."
2,DVD is dead,I completely fail to see why they are re-releasing this when everyone will be picking it up again once the Blu-Ray version is out.What is taking so long for the Blu-Ray version anyway?
4,Step by Step guide,This book was just what I needed....a step by step guide for for becoming more efficient with DW and CF.
2,Be Careful You Buy the Correct Model,"Be sure to check your wiring before you order this product. I bought this item from Amazon and attempted to install but soon realized I only had a 2-wire connection in the electrical box. This unit has a white, black and blue wire and all three need to be connected per their diagram. You can do an internet search on the model and view installation..once you remove the unit from its plastic packaging Amazon will not accept your return."
5,OFF THE HOOK - WELCOME BACK TUPAC & BIGGIE IN ONE,"This lyrist is what Hip Hop needs right now, the business is getting to watered down, Mr. Mike is putting the sting of the streets and lyrics back into hip hop. I don't know where this guy has come from but I welcome him with open arms. Promote his stuff it is hot and will rule the Hip Hop World Naturally."
1,One Day Closer,"I'm a BIG JE fan from way back, but this is one of the worst recordings he ever made! In fact, it's so bad that I've never been able to get thru the entire CD. Sorry JE, but i really tried several times and just can't get into this one."
3,Great series! Poor packaging!,"I was annoyed when I saw that the ninth season of Beverly Hills 90210 comes in a one case plastic package. Now I have eight same type seasons and the ninth is different. On and all, another great interesting and worthy season."
3,You left it out,I remember the five satins since my cousin Eddie Martin was one of the original members this album lacks one of their best recordings (Our Anniversary) without that song on their album you are doing the public & the satins and their longtime fans a diservice
1,"Don't buy this ""report""","This is not a book. It reminded me of a seventh graders science report that was put together by a poor copy shop. I returned the ""report"" immediately."
3,Good,"Great writing insights into a good book. Can't really remember reading it. I'm wondering if I received it. Thus, I'm giving it 3 stars because I can't recall it and don't want to criticize it. As I am a writer myself, it was of particular interest to me."
1,A shallow and superficial study.,"The book is poorly written, a umble of unformulated thoughts and half-developped ideas. The author also appears to be biased- not a good point if you want to discover something on your own, without your perception being warped - as the author's apparently was - by a one-sided view."
1,bad product,"The product arrived in bad shape and it didn't work. The stereo was not reading CD, DVD, anything. I lost my money buying this product"
4,"Great quality, made in USA","This sleep mask is soft, keeps the light out, and is great in general except for one thing: the adjustable strap. If you have a big head, the strap fits too tightly, and does not have enough velcro to lengthen. I will have to sew in some strips of velcro to modify. No issues if you don't have a big head. It's worth the minor inconvenience because of the quality and performance, and it's also made in the USA."
5,On time and brand new,"We ordered a TV series DVD. It arrived on time and brand new, just as described. Would definitely order from this seller again!"
2,msguided,"I'm a Timothy Olyphant fan. When I read the reviews, I thought I was going to see a tough guy series. This is soft. Other than Olyphant, the acting is spotty."
2,Horrible show!,"Terrible acting, ridiculous story line, and main character is unrealistic! The person who directed this series thinks we are all morons!"
3,Questionable.,"The first videos started out great, ran smoothly with little to no hesisation. But the last two episodes were not great. The very last one, it took me about 3 hours to get the last 20 minutes of the final episode to play. It kept losing the connection and having to reset, over and over and over again. Extremely frustrating. IT would lock up, then try to re-establish a connection, and finally tell me connection was lost, retry?"
5,Awesome,"This show is just awesome. From the sarcasm that Raylan Givens brings to the table to his absolute bad @$$ness, it's an amusing, enthralling, and entertaining show."
3,Silly,This show is ok. But really not very plausible or based on any reality. Being in Kentucky is a nice change.
3,Just Okay,"Timothy Olyphant's talents are underplayed in this series. The director & writer should have watched ""Hitman"", ""Deadwood"", and ""The Perfect Getaway"" to realize the power of this actor.So many scenes are wasted because they didn't take it to the edge. Olyphant is milk toast, instead of titanium steel."
5,Mesmerizing,I finally got a chance to see all the episodes of the first season and I can't wait to see season two.
5,LOVE IT!!!!,"Awesome series. The characters are good and each show builds on the other, one by one.Addictive!! If you liked Walt Coggins in ""The Shield,"" you will absolutely LOVE HIM in ""Justified."""
5,Brand New,I am very impressed in the condition I received the dvd series in. It was wrapped in it's original package and a bargain for the price I received it at. Recommended to other buyers.
1,Not Happy,The blu-ray showed up on time and sealed. It was missing disc two. How does a sealed package ship will a missing disc. This is sloppy. I have lost a lot of faith in who Amazon uses as partners. The lack of replacement options is extremely frustrating as well.
5,Hooked on Justified!,Unusual characters and unexpected plot twists with a realistic Southern flavor make this show a Must See! Can't wait to indulge in Season 2.
5,Raylan's the coolest guy to grace a screen since Gary Cooper.,"Easy to follow plot lines, a likable lead character and OUTSTANDING dialog combine to make this a show for today and tomorrow. For folks that don’t live in a fly-over state, this may be as close as you get to “the rest of America”. Granted, it’s stylized and many times in the extreme but, it’s FUN people!"
4,Yes - Order This One!,"Finally, I picked a good karaoke CD! This has a nice variety of classics to entertain the over 40 croud, from Mack the Knife to the Girl from Ipanema. The best part is the outstanding background instrumentals. Great sax, flute and trumpet solos break up the verses and are brilliantly played. I had trouble picking out the melody on a couple of the songs, but that was due to my unfamiliarity with the songs, and overall lack of singing talent. Included in the collection is the great duet, Unforgettable - graphics are color coded. I think anyone who enjoys doing karaoke should get this CD, to start or add to their collection."
4,Not Big Enough,"Beautifully built, well finished and attractive.I had to return it. It was not large enough for my 17"" laptop--Toshiba Sattelite P-25. Check the dimensions of your laptop before you buy, not all 17"" laptops will fit based on my experience.Other than that I think I would have loved this bag."
2,"Decent, not great.....","I've enjoyed the Chemical brothers older work, but this CD is OK, not great. It doesn't sound fresh, and some of the tracks are somewhat annoying. I would recommend ""Surrender"" if you want a solid collection of their style/work, but this album misses."
5,A rollercoaster of an album.,"All you have to do is skip track 7 and 10, which are the two vocal collaborations. The lyrics on these tracks aren't very impressive, and they just mess up the flow of an otherwise superb cd. The music is very impressive, I even enjoy listening to it with the volume down low. Intense psychedelic beats, good stuff."
4,"Earthy, sexy","This has some earthy, you must dance, cosmic, sexy tracks. It has at least three really good numbers that I seem to play repeatedly, and I don't normally like this kind of music."
1,Boooooooring,"I recoomend this movie to people with insomnia. It is slooow, the male character is shallow, immature, and the premise that the woman would have an affair and all would be the same back home is ludicrous."
4,Low tech does work,"Trying to find the additional card packs,(-),(x) and (/). My kids love this, they don't think of them as flash cards that are supplementing their homework,even my 5 yr old is woking the addition. The kids play with it more as a game. Great car/travel activity."
4,A Compeling Account of Man on Man Rape,"""The Cries of Men"" offers a compeling account of young man growing up in a homophobic society and eventually becoming the victim of sexual abuse by other men. O'brien story is a detailed account of his first rape at four years old to his final rape at age 21. The social context of Jamaica offers is portrayed as another character in the book as it gives an insight into the very primitive view on homosexuality on the island. A compeling story a bit graphic at times but I guess the author has to be to illustrate his point on the horrors of rape or man on man rape for that matter."
1,Dangerous Product Beware!,These things are extremely fragile making them a hazard. Gave my roommate an ugly laceration on his hand when one exploded while he was cleaning it.
3,Very pretty but scared to use them,They are soooo thin- I am really afraid to use them on a regular basis. I wish they were about 2x as thick. Wonderful design but just too delicate for my tastes
3,What you see is NOT what you get,"I think this will work fine, but what you see is not what you get. I thought I was getting the exact item pictured: the real Bodyography eye pencil I am accustomed to with the gold outer covering. I received eye pencils that have very similar markings and are identified as Bodyography, but the outer color is silver, not gold. Hmmmm. Is that why the price is so good?"
1,Unreliable,"The fact that this book recommends the Hartness House in Springfield, Vermont makes me doubt its worth. The Hartness House only looks good in the winter when the snow covers many of the problems. I would not trust this book."
2,Ali Akbar (con)-Fusion,"Despite my negative review, be assured that I'm huge Ali Akbar Khan fan. However, the two records he released for Triloka were, in my view, uninspired attempts to reach a cross-over new-agey audience. His father, Allaudin Khan, also taught Ravi Shankar, who had quite a bit of international success blending Indian classical music with Western music. This record and one called 'Journey' might have been similarly minded attempts to find a crossover audience, but ugh.'Garden of Dreams' suffers most when it succumbs to a tendency for saccharine melodies with an eastern 'twang', yet it is still superior to the even more dismal 'Journey'.If you want to know why Ali Akbar Khan is one of the most revered 20th century musicians look elsewhere, such as ""Traditional Music of India"" or his numerous releases on AMMP records, especially the ""Signature Series""."
3,not sure,"nice for those quick pick up's. Will clog easily if it picks up anything bigger than a piece of dog food. Battery lasts for a while, but not as long as they say it will. I bought mine at a local vacuum shop, and have had to get it serviced once this year. Will also clog with hair/dust bunnies if you are in a particularly dirty are, like behind doors and in corners and such. I do like having it handy, but still have to bust out the big vac if I want to do a better job."
4,Too modern in style but still fascinating,"This was an excellent and engrossing book - that never once made me feel as if a Tudor Englishman had written it - unless he sounded like a late-twentieth-century woman. Nothing wrong with that, but I found the literary device of the ""autobiography"" to be pretty much in name only here. (One of the most glaring examples was when Henry says to himself something along the lines of ""Go for it - you know you want to."" Okay...) Other than that, I did enjoy it and read it very rapidly. While I loved the time period chosen, I think I may prefer Ms. George's other books, only because they're written from the female perspective and I don't think I'll find the tone as jarring. It's hard, given this portrayal, to say whether I liked or didn't like Henry VIII as a man - I don't think I really got to know him here, but what DID shine through was very riveting at times."
1,NOT and Autobiography,The title is very misleading. But do not be misled. This is NOT an autobiography. It is fiction.
5,I felt like I was by Henry VIII's side his whole life!,I read this book about 10 years ago and have just re-read it. It is just as I remembered it... wonderful! It offers a whole new side to the man we love to hate. I could not put it down and did not want it to end!
3,"A very educational, but sometimes boring book","This is a very well researched book. I wanted to rate it higher, but I couldn't, because there were parts to this book where I couldn't stand to read on. I was just too bored. I don't credit this to Margaret George at all. The predictability of the book comes directly from King Henry's life. Therefore, she did well in her job of putting down his life. I struggled getting through it, just because it is a slow book"
5,Absolutely Excellent!!,"After having read official biography after biography about Hal the 8th it was wonderful to read a fictionalized account of his life that followed fairly closely the 'true' events of his life. Although his courtship of Anne Boleyn left much to be desired- more of a business arrangement than grand passion- it didn't stop me from enjoying the rest of the book. Margaret George has done a wonderful job and I can't wait for her next novel. Anything by Ms. George is worth the read and I heartily recommend ""Mary, Queen of Scotland and the Isles"", also."
1,Not a quality unit,"I ordered the Royal 115CX because of my mobile food vending business at special events and farmer's markets. Straight out of the box the ac adapter got fire hot when plugged-in. The unit work for a little while on the battery power, then it failed to turn on. Then when it did turn-on it failed to turn off. I sent for an exchange to see what the next unit will do. If my replacement comes up short I will try to find a SHARP, or CASIO or even a CANON. I would not recommend this unit for those whose business depends on high volume sales or any type of sales for that matter."
1,not for commercial use,"this unit is too slow on batteries, will not print a journal receipt, and the power adapter that came with it is a universal adapter so you need to set the voltage, and it did not work. a change box is easier."
1,"horrible, slow cheap plastic, waste of money","We bought this thinking is would be perfect for a town market / farmers market environment.wrong we look like fools once you enter a sale of 4.99 it takes a long time to enter it meanwhile it makes this horrible noise on and on and the customers just look at you. It could take forever to check out someone with mutiple items, its very slow slow slow. Also cash drawers have cheap plastic money holders that break off on first use. the entire register is plastic everything breaks the locking key is a joke. Do not waste money or time on this one its going back to amazon."
4,Even Better With The Bonus Tracks,"Years ago I owned ""Raw"" on cassette. I liked it then. Especially songs like ""Moments In Time"", ""Hell Or High Water"" and the title cut, ""Raw"" Now re-released with 5 bonus cuts this CD is even better. Reminscent of early U2, this CD has some terrific songs. Check them out."
4,Very good jig saw blades - bought a 2nd batch,"I bought these as the jig saw blades I was using kept braking - sometimes after just an hour of use & could only be used on light work projects. These blades are great. I used them to cut lumber, many many tree branches up to 2-1/2 inches thick, hard plastic, but have not tried any scroll work. When I have a small job I use these instead of getting out the power saw, as they can cut so reliably that I am still on my first batch of 5. Still using the first blade which I bought 5 months ago. I am a weekend warrior, so it does not get daily use. They were so good that I bought a 2nd batch of 5, as I was worried that amazon might not offer these and I would have to pay double at the local hardware store, if I could find them. I am attaching a picture, so you can see what it looks like when new."
2,Extension Stop,I did not find this useful. I thought they retract for transport and storage but they do not. In order to change the stop to the other side you need to remove the slides. I would return if not for the shipping cost being close to the item value.
2,Not what I expected,"The stop mechanism is a little hard to tighten, and I question the accuracy. The length of the bars is only good for short work. It was a dissapointment after purchaising the saw, which is fantastic, and as a result I had to make my own miter extension and stop. Buy the saw and save your money on this."
2,old eyes can't follow this,"I found that the tablature is so tight that the numbers run together, making it very hard to read, and thus making this book useless."
4,Good.... but......,"The mag77 is an excellent saw, the only thing i have to say bad about it is the aluminum foot. It doesnt hold up to abuse as well as the conventional steel foot. I have been thru three of them already cause of bends and warping. Overall this saw is very reliable and much lighter than its counterpart."
3,Not always compatible,"When I got the cardreader I assumed it would work with any SD memory card - but in fact it doesn't support the Lexar 4GB Plat. II card, so I am thinking it might not support cards of 2GB or more. (The cardreader that came with the Lexar works fine with the card) - what was worse; when restarting with the defunct card and card reader attached, my Mac could not get past the grey start screen which caused some panic."
5,One of the best,"Cummings is one of the best American minor poets. He invents a language, a style a way of saying things all his own. And he does this in memorable lines and with his own kind of beauty. ""What of a much of a which of a wind "" "" There's a hell of a universe ,next door. Let's Go"" "" I sing of Olaf, glad and big "" "" Nothing not even the rain has such small hands"" The style is magnetic and there is a most individualistic celebration of life and love.Appealing. But without the largeness of Whitman or the mind of Dickinson or the music of Stevens,it is not at the very highest level.And also sharing with Pound and Eliot, and to a lesser degree Hemingway and Fitzgerald the Anti- Semitism of his time which makes it therefore almost impossible for me to read the stuff with uncritical joy as I would like to."
5,a wonderful cummings collection for the novice,"for anyone just getting to know e. e. cummings, or for someone looking for a varitable ""best of"" collection, this is the book to have. cummings is my all time favorite poet, and this book gives an excellent sampling of his work."
2,Spanish subtitles,"The Spanish subtitles doesn't exist, because, i bought this movie and the only subtitles are english and french."
3,"Good Movie, bad DVD","I really loved this movie. Each of the actors gave a phenomenal performance and the plot was wonderful. I did however have some problems with the actual DVD itself. Like other reviewers that posted comments, I was frustrated with the fact that the DVD got hung up several times. I don't have a Sony, I actually have a fairly new Sanyo (gasp!) DVD player and this is the 1st time I've had these problems. I'm not tech-savvy so I thought that it might be my player, but once I saw the other reviews with similar experiences I realized it was the DVD.If it wasn't for the DVD troubles, I would have given this movie 4 stars. The movie itself was excellent. It was nice to see Will Ferrell get a little more serious (I still love silly Will Ferrell) and he did a fine job in this movie. Of course in my opinion, anything that Maggie Gyllenhal is in is great."
1,Sony's Copy Protection is REALLY Stranger than Fiction!,"Imagine my surprise when a SONY DVD will not play in my SONY (DVP-CX995V) DVD player. It actually caused my Player to auto shut off! Assuming a bad disc I returned the original only to have the same problem. A 30 second web search confirmed that Sony used this DVD as a guinea pig to introduce their latest copy protection scheme. Another 30 second search turned up three programs already in place that will defeat it.When will these companies learn? Aren't they aware that those of us that DON'T steal are totally disgusted with being forced to watch their moronic anti-piracy ""previews""? And aren't they aware that anyone that is inclined to make copies could not possibly care less about the tricks they put on the discs?BTW. The movie was pretty good but I was so disgusted with Sony I didn't enjoy it very much."
2,Absolutely Terrible,"I found myself staring at the screen in ""Stranger Than Fiction"" and waiting for something imaginative to happen. And it never did. Do not waste your time watching this movie. Sure it is supposed to be ""artsy"", but it does not even work on that level. I do watch quite a bit of movies, and chose to watch this one because I like Will Ferrell most of the time, and was willing to give him a chance in a more dramatic role, but he just can't pull it off. At times it seems like he's trying to be funny, but it is not appropriate. At other times he tries to be serious, and you can't believe it. It just wasn't a good movie."
5,A Modern Classic,"I have to admit, even old guys stuck in the past can enjoy this modern tale. Anyway, I did. Especially when that cold, modern life eroded under the assault of warm influences and generous tendencies. And the callous storyteller grew a heart. And the story--the improbable, ludicrous, amazing story--found an ending I could live with.The special effects provided an interesting sheen. A fresh storyline complimented the modern feel. And the acting? Wonderful turns by all. Tony Hale...great supporting character. Queen Latifah...did her best with a limited role. Maggie Gyllenhaal...radiated sincerity and a funky integrity. Dustin Hoffman...earnestly professorial and as deadpan as you get. Emma Thompson...perfect voice for this film as she poured herself entirely into her character. And Will Ferrell...who knew he of all people could underplay a character and breathe so much life and quiet humor into him?This movie will become a classic."
3,Just okay - a bit on the long side,"I'm all for originality, which was one of the only things this movie had going for it. I was glad the narration mostly ceased after the movie started, because it rapidly became annoying.Will Ferrell had his funny moments, and the story was fine, the movie just seemed to drag. This movie would have been much tighter with about 20 - 30 minutes trimmed.Queen Latifah's role was underwhelming. Her character had a few meaningless lines and that entire subplot was a waste of space. Not sure why they even bothered with her role.In all, this was an okay movie. It gets 3 stars instead of 2 because of its originality, but this was never laugh out loud funny, nor something that you could watch over and over."
4,Will Ferrell is normal this time,"In his past movies, Will Ferrell has taken up roles which portray him as a wild and sarcastic funny character, such as in Elf and Anchorman. However, this time he actually pretends to be a normal person with unusual problems. Although the film is categorized under ""comedy"", I did not see that many jokes being made or find myself laughing that much. But the humor that is included here is more of a subtle type, where other people act weird and the audience can relate to Will's reactions. Overall the movie was enjoyable to watch, with both Maggie Gyllenhaal and Dustin Hoffman giving great performances. It's not award-winning material, but at least you can be entertained while seeing Will in a different light than before. The cookie scene was hilarious."
3,Good movie just NOT a comedy,"I saw somewhere where it said ""Best Comedy of the Year"". How was this a comedy? Was a good movie, just wish they would have presented it as what is WAS instead of a comedy. If you go in thinking it WILL be a comedy you will be in for a suprise. Touching and sweet movie that starts out a little odd but makes up for it later."
1,"Mmmh... thanks, but no.","Vacuous, pretentious and annoyingly predictable. You can tell how and when this movie is going to end looong before the end actually comes. To top it all, Will Ferrel just can't play dramatic roles... but is this a drama? I guess Marc Forster and Zach Helm just invented a new genre: the 'feelgood' artsy film. I only wish i'd spent fictitious money on it."
4,good quality,i used ink cartridge and had it refilled twice. ink quality was best first time. refilled cartridge trended to streak.
3,I always use original HP ink,"I always use HP ink for my printer. I have found it very reliable, never smudgy, and worth the few extra dollars. HOWEVER, see my review of the seller. Amazon working with sellers that rip people is the reason I lowered my rating. Product=great. Buying process=the pits. I expect more from amazon and the people it partners with."
3,Holds too little ink,All cartridges especially HP ones run out of ink way too quickly. This particular cartridge seems to take it to another level. It is a little difficult to install but that is more a printer problem but there is guilt through association. I would look for a compatible cartridge if one exists.
2,Old but not bad,"This album is around 40 years old and harping has come a long way since then. I ordered it for nostalgic purposes; it had been one of my favorites back then. But upon listening now, I'm disappointed. By comparison to the best of today's harp CD's, it's a bit dull."
5,retired woodworker,great tool as all my bosch tools. did not find the same problem others have written about. the blade and fences were true and all joints were perfect. would recommend this miter saw to anyone doing serious work.
2,Bosch 3912,"I have owned and have regularly used this saw for over three years. As others have pointed out it is almost impossible to get 100 percent accurate cuts from this saw. Tightening the lock down knob does push the blade out of alignment. The only thing you can do to improve this is to not over tighten the knob, but keeping the blade from shifting is still problematic. There is also some play in the blade which allows it to deflect slightly from the work piece, no matter how expensive or stiff a blade you use (worse when cutting hardwoods). But I've discovered that miter saws by their nature aren't accurate enough for fine work. To get extremely accurate crosscuts you need to use an accurately tuned table saw."
2,SAFETY ALERT!!!! SAFETY ALERT!!!!,"I got my Bosch 3912 saw two months ago. Everything seemed fine until I discovered, quite by accident, that while plugged into an outlet, there is about 45 volts present on ALL metal parts of the machine!!!. All Bosch said was: ""You probably had better get it looked at."" Seems kind of laid back for a potentially deadly scenario. Bosch, can you say ""PRODUCT LIABILITY?"" So, check your saw immediately, Bosch owners!!!"
1,Reviews didn't ring true on this one...,"I bought this saw because of the reviews I read on this site. I have found several faults with this saw, one being serious with the blade tightening. The blade came loose, wabbling and shattered the guard. Whether this was my fault or not shouldn't matter, the fact that the blade could come loose like that at all is not a good or safe design in my opinion. Another fault is the safety switch, it is difficult to push while operating. I also found the table slide to be very stiff, like metal grinding, when making adjustments on miter. I hope this review help someone to Not buy this saw for there own safety sake. Save your money and wait for Dewalts new 12"" that's coming out soon."
4,Well Worth the Money,"As a trim carpenter, this saw has seen a lot of abuse and has taken it well. It's smooth, quiet, and well worth the money. I'm having a little problem with the guard sticking on the downstroke, but I just lift the guard a little before applying pressure. I've tried tightening the guard bolt, but it keeps slipping. As the for problem with the table being tight as mentioned in a previous review, a little oil under the glide points will solve that problem. Sawdust can build up on any sliding table and cause the same problem. I give Bosch 4 stars on this model because of the guard sticking, but I wouldn't let this prevent me from buying another 3912B. And just like everyone else says, invest in a teflon-coated or other high-quality blade for fine finish work. I have DeWalt's 12 inch saw, Makita's 10 inch slide, and this model from Bosch is far superior."
3,hard!,"The pan is cute. Cake baked fine, but decorating it was a real challenge. I am not master baker. . .but I have made the wilton Mickey, pirate ship, and bunny all of which I thought turned out great, but I just couldn't get the details to really look like Ariel on this. However, my 4 year old daughter knew who it was supposed to be and loved it, so that's all that matters :)"
1,AWFUL,"There aren't enough bad things in the world that can be said about this printer. It has cost me so much time, frustration and anguish. It's probably the worst printer in the history of printers and I cannot express how much I hate this printer. I'd rather invest $100 in Morgan Stanley right now than buy this printer if I was faced with that decision today. DO NOT BUY"
1,Nothing but trouble,"Forget this printer if you're a Mac Leopard user. Since I've upgraded to 10.5.2, I've gotten every message listed in other reviews, especially the one about a communications problem with the printer. It shows up on the USB, but absolutely refuses to print. It will scan however, which is unusual according to other's reviews. I would stay away from this model. I NEVER got a response from my e-mail for support at HP, and the phone support knows nothing about the Mac. When it was working for me (briefly) it was an ink hog, too.NEVER BUY IT!"
2,Too much frustration - look elsewhere,"Want a new hobby - messing with printer installation - then buy this printer. The c4280 is an exercise in frustration, at least with Windows Vista. Vista keeps forgetting the printer and then HP reinstalls the printer automatically so you end up with multiple copies in your ""Printers"" list. Prepare to spend lots of time waiting for HP to reinstall the c4280 several times a week. Oh, and HP installs all kinds of software on your machine -- just nothing to resolve this problem."
2,Makin' Jam,"I've owned this printer for several months. Like many others, I have discovered the carriage jam problem. Every few pages, it develops an unknown carriage jam and hangs up the carriage. There is no paper in when it happens -- it's always just after printing the page. Searches for help from HP resulted in several suggestions to unplug everything and plug it back in. Pressing the OK button on the printer somehow clears the carriage with lots of loud noises.The worst of it is that it only happens after I print, and if I don't catch it, the carriage never parks and the ink cartridges dry out. They can be restored to use after several self cleanings, but of course this means I'm running through the ink like crazy.Bottom line: I want a worry-free printer, and this isn't it."
3,"Good document printer and scanner, but don't buy it for photos or copying","Purchased in July 2007 - but never really used as a photo printer because of how quickly the ink quality would diminish after only a couple of 4x6 or 8x10 prints. Scanner works very well but copier only works well on a *** setting. Now that I'm especially an on-the-go photographer and student, spending as much as I am on inks for this printer has made me realize I need a better solution."
4,OK printer for the price,"I was looking for a simple printer/scanner/copier for my daughter to take to school. I wanted something reliable without tons of menus or complications. It can also read and print directly from several types of memory cards.So far this printer fits the bill - does everything simply at a decent price. I also bought one for my nephew. The print output looks good and is quick enough for individual use. Simple copying is easy - push one button for B&W; or one for color. I don't know how well it will last, as we just started using it.Downside - There is no separate output tray, so it is easy for printed papers to spit into the paper tray and get jumbled and possibly cause a jam. If you want to walk away during a large print job, this is not the printer for you.Also, the inks are very expensive. A set of ink cartridges (large capacity) cost almost as much as the printer. True photo quality prints also require a different ink cartridge."
1,"HP C4280, a jalopy","From the respected Co of HP comes one of the worst pieces of junk ever made. Stay away from it. It is one of the most ponderous difficult machines you could ever have the misfortune to own. I also own a simple, cheap all in on Lexmark that's even older and it works far better with much less fuss."
1,Now we know why Apple Stores are giving these away!!!,"This is an absolute piece of junk!One paper jam after the next, poor copy quality, and it's slower than molasses!I'm digging through my storage space to reclaim my 5 yr-old HP that worked much better!Don't waste your money! And if you get one for free, don't waste your time!"
1,Worst printer I have ever owned.,"Came for free with my new Macbook. I regret the $7 in sales tax I had to pay. This printer has brought me nothing but grief. It jams. It refuses to acknowledge that it has ink cartridges installed. It does not slide the ink cartridges to the right so I can replace/re-seat them. It takes several minutes to turn off. If you try to skip the ridiculous power-down sequence by un-plugging it, it just does it when you plug it back in."
1,don't buy!,"This printer is simply awful-- as one of the previous reviewers stated before, probably more than half the time I printed, I had a paper jam, and when I tried scanning, it almost never worked. Scanning worked for approx. the first couple months, but less than 8 months in, it began having ""USB connection"" problems. Even after I resorted to taking PICTURES of my files and sticking the SD card into the printer, it still didn't work! The printer simply could not access my files, and it constantly screwed up my computer. If it didn't misalign my printing pages, it jammed my paper. In fact, I began counting it luck if my printer ever worked normally. And a couple of times during printing, some TINY metal gears and parts came out! I was shocked at the quality of my new printer. This truly is a pile of junk-- I'm thinking about trashing the whole thing, and I've owned it for less than a year."
1,Don't waste your time with this,"My family and I got this as an all-over printer scanner. I draw so the scanner was important and so was the printing, as we like to create T-shirt Iron-Ons. It works so long as it stays connected with the PC.... WHICH IT DOESN'T!We've had NOTHING BUT TROUBLE with this printer. It's such a pain. We get a LOT of ""USB not connected"". We can never seem to get it to stay connected with the computer for very long. Sure it's a decent printer, it's got a great set-up what with printing, scanning, copying and whatnot. It's great but the connection causes me to hate it with a vengence.Overall, don't waste your time and money on this. Try something different. (Maybe not HP?)We're in the market for a new one."
1,Not even worth one star,"I got this 3-in-one printer, free after rebate when I purchased an iMac. At first it works fine. After about 4-6 months, it suddenly died. It no longer scanned. I called up HP and they sent me another one. However, the second one also died suddenly after a few months. I was just changing the color cartridge. Afterwards I was prompted to align the cartridges. I placed the alignment page onto the scanner bed and it could not detect it after a dozen tries in every conceivable paper position possible. I then tried just scanning something and it could not scan. Bottom line, it's a piece of junk that will not last. Boo to HP."
5,Bob Marley Lives!!,"This is a GREAT Disc!! The sound is incredible!! This CD is much better than any disc I have ever heard of Bob Marley. It sounds like Bob Marley is in the room with you and the bass is awesome!!! If you remotely think you like Bob Marley, get this disc NOW!!"
2,Not For Me,"Sorry, but I wish that I would have saved my money on this one. Maybe because I'm a Jay Hickman fan is the reason that this one let me down. This one isn't as raw with the language as in some of the other comedy albums but I just didn't enjoy it."
2,Not as good as Superhero,"I was not very impressed with this cd. I am a huge Stephen Lynch fan, but I am very disappointed with the quality of this cd. I prefer to have the live version as such recorded with superhero versus the studio taped version of this one. Plus the only songs that were funny to me were kill a kitten, hermaphrodite, and special... sorry Stephen Lynch"
5,A rare treat for all to enjoy..,This CD is great. It is very funny. I have not been able to stop listening to it. Stephen's lyrics capture the essence of dark humor. The icing on the cake is that he has a great voice. Many artist don't have a good voice they simply rely on the beats and lyrics. Stephen is able to capture everything. He is not just a comedian is a true artist. A Little Bit Special is a rare CD that will appeal to a wide variety of people.
5,One hell of a TALENTED comic!!!,"This cd is only for those who have a sense of humor. Those who don't shouldnt bother. His music is witty, well written and just down right hysterical. Excellent live performer too. Definately a must have cd if you want to laugh with your friends and have a great time. But aside from the comedic aspect, he is a great singer too"
5,"Intelligent, fresh, laugh-out-loud, CD","Stephen has the most provocative, innovative, seriously funny stuff to come along in a decade. See him live and you're a fan forever! The CD is definately a keeper, a collector's item. All my friends agreed... it's original and smart humor...His singing ability and voice range are superb... Buy it, you will not regret it!!!!"
1,I'm not sure????,"I'm not sure how good the work-out is the dvd is scratched. Haven't been able to do an entire routine! You can't stop your bound in mid air while the dvd stops and re-starts. Really diappointed, expected more from my purchase on Amazon."
3,Be careful when you DRY this item!,"When I first opened the package, I thought this item was a super bargain for the price (I have a very deep plush pillow-top mattress).Then I pre-washed and dried it (on delicate/low setting), and discovered that the non-cotton batting/interior lining had melted in a few places.Luckily, the melted spots were few, but they're enough to pretty much ruin the product. As a work-around, I've turned it inside out so that the rough, melted interior spots don't abrade against my mattress (I can hardly feel them through the fitted sheet). Sounds pretty hokey, but it's still on my bed instead of in a landfill.TLDR version: if you dry this item in a normal/home dryer, keep a sharp eye on it--even if it's on your dryer's lowest setting!"
2,Not 100%cotton,This mattress pad is NOT 100% cotton. Only the outer cover is cotton. The inner materials are polyester. This is not good for those who find polyester hot to sleep on.
3,Fine...,"There are so many other things in life to get excited about before reviewing a mattress pad. This time, however, it was promptly delivered and in excellent condition. It does go well with the remodel.If a 100% cotton damask stripe king size mattress pad floats your boat, I recommend this one."
5,Fabulous Mattress Pad,"Nice job on this mattress pad. Fits the bed, cushioned, clean, sturdy. Good hand overall. Great product!"
5,Great Buy,"This is an incredible product. It is thick, soft and actually fits the bed. The corners are made of real cotton- not the mesh material that rips. It is well worth the money."
5,Great product,This product works great. This fit my bed nicely and it stays on pretty well. I highly recommended this product.
5,great buy!,"What a great buy -- it's not a very thick pad, but it really does make a difference on the mattress."
5,Great,"feels good, fits good, washes and dries just fine. Bought for toddlers twin bed, and its been fine."
4,Won't do much on its own,This is a really good quality mattress pad. Hopefully my title doesn't lead you to believe otherwise. It's just not as thick as you might be imagining without having it in front of you. What we did was buy a memory foam pad along with this; that way we had the pillowy thickness we craved and this let air circulation occur between the memory foam and us at night. This also keeps the memory foam topper secured really well. I don't regret buying this product in the slightest. It's held up amazingly well. But it probably won't be all of the padding that you need without some additional support.
4,very happy,"Purchased this mattress pad for my queen bed which is about 15-16 inches deep and it fits very well with a little room to spare. It stays in place nicely and the padding feels great. I have had this item for about a month at the time of this review and i am pleased with it in every wayso far. As others have mentioned the sides are far from gauzy, they are thick and have a lot of stretch. If you rip the sides putting it on you're doing something wrong. Also, due to the mixed reviews of how this mattress pad stands up to the dryer, i chose the safest option and just line dried it."
1,"Burn, baby, Burn!",This product MELTED even under medium heat in the dryer. Save yourself some grief; buy one at JC Penny's which won't melt and will most likely last for years.
2,Melted in dryer,"Seemed nice when I took it out of the package, but after following the instructions to wash it before I used them, the back part melted in the dryer."
2,Still hot,"I bought this in hopes to cool down my pillow top bed. It helped a little, at least it worked in the winter, but I am again waking up sweating in the middle of the night. It helps reduce the heat a little but not enough"
2,Full size in queen size packaging.,I ordered 2 of these as a present and was embarrassed that when they opened the plasticand removed the pad that it was a full size pad. I cannot send it back becauseit had been 31 days. I gave them the one I was going to use. You have to removefrom the package to see the tag on the pad.
3,It's okay,"It'll cover your mattress, and it will fit it well, but the product itself doesn't really do a whole lot beyond that. Doesn't add much comfort or anything"
5,Excellent,"I have a latex mattress and my new wife is highly allergic to latex. To solve this problem without getting rid of an expense and excellent mattress I purchased a 3"" memory foam topper. I kept the mattress cover on the latex mattress, put the memory foam topper on top of that, and then put this new mattress cover over it all -- this mattress cover has such deep 'pockets' that it completely covered all the above and I was able to tuck it under the mattress for a firm position without it shifting around. Plus, the mattress cover, in itself, is very comfortable. A win-win all around. An excellent purchase."
4,OK product for the money.,"I don't have high mattress, so I didn't have any problems putting it on and it fits perfect on my california king bed."
2,be carefull when you wash it,i took it out of the package and carefully followed the care nstrcutions for washing it. When i took the maress pad out of the washer (before even drying it) bottom layer had begun to deteriate and come a part. the top layer is still fine and i cannot notice any problems with it while its on my ed but i wonder about how long it will last.
2,Fit the bed but not comfortable,I ordered the queen version of the mattress pad. It fit the bed just fine no problems. As soon as I laid down on it I felt the difference that it was much softer. After about 10 minutes my lower back started to hurt and I didn't have that problem before I put it on. So far I've slept on it for three nights and my lower back has been a bit sore each morning. I will probably put it on the guest bed so at least I wont lose my money on the item.
1,What a joke,I bought this mattress pad because of the high reviews. The pad appeared used when it arrived. Just threw it away because the quality did not seem very great.
2,MADE IN CHINA--LAND BEWARE!!!,"I just washed this pad for the 2nd time in my very large washer following the instructions ""on the gentle cycle"".I hang dry my wash & use the dryer to fluff only,and I notice the stitching is coming apart in several places that holds the top to the bottom,so I guess it won't last that long,hey it's MADE IN CHINA what do you expect!!!I did not know that till I had it in my hands and read the lable.The next one that I will buy will be from a good department store (100 miles away,one way)that says on the lable ""MADE IN AMERICA""!But,around these parts we only have WALLEYMART,to which I did get one of their Mainstays pads,it didn't even last a year,before the top ripped apart!So I got this pad based on the reviews,I will not get another one."
3,"Good, solid documentary.","Pretty good documentary about 3 different women making effective changes in the lives of their community members. This documentary was realistic, and gave a good view of what goals the women are trying to achieve.In the midst of poverty, the 3 women seem optimistic about bettering their communities. A HIV-positive woman in Vietnam seeks to educate others about HIV prevention and prevent the spread of HIV. An educated woman in the poverty-stricken country of Mali has established a foundation to educate migrant girls and help them obtain job skills. And a woman in Bosnia seeks to establish a women's agricultural coop to economically benefit her community as well as bring together different ethnicities.The documentary was more informative than emotional or heartfelt. I didn't feel my heartstrings being tugged, but the documentary did leave me with a sense of feeling inspired, and optimistic towards mankind."
3,Mary f/Eve,"I have to give it to Mary J.Blige and Eve for ""Not Today"". It's definitely a hot track. ""Promises all the time/spittin' line after line/broke down my wall/than you got in my mind""--I've been there Eve, I know what you're saying...LOL. I didn't hear the whole album though, but that song is HOT!"
4,Its aight,"The album is pretty good. Its all over the place. The indeed bangers are Sleepy Brown/Outkast, Mary J & track#14 or so The Spitfiya/Anthony Hamilton song is the hottest of the whole album. I say its worth a purchase, but a cut from Cube & Queen wouldnt have hurt."
2,Mediocre,If I had to rate this album about who's appearing on it that will probably earn more stars than the overall quality of music. This cd is not anything like the first Barbershop. It lacks the overall performance of having the allstars aboard and giving the people what they want which is Good Quality Music...
4,It's a Shaker,"What do you need to make a good drink? A glass, ice, quality ingredients and a shaker. This certainly qualifies as the latter. Certainly works as advertised without being pricey."
5,Beautiful comforting book after the loss of my cat,"This little book is much like the Rainbow Bridge poem, such a sweet touching childlike story that tells the special bond between human and cat. The pictures are cute and it really gave me comfort after the loss of my beloved Kitty Thumpy. I love it so much I will buy it for all my friends. They have a ""For Every Dog an Angel"" also that is just as lovely. I also recommend the book ""Do Dogs Go to Heaven?"" By M. Jean Holmes, if your looking for more Bible based factual book.."
3,pain,"id reccomend any of the other books since this one is a pain. You die everywhere you turn and to even pass the fist part you need to die, but still keep the item? i guess it rolls over?"
2,Boring,"I found this book to be incredibly dry. I was required to read it for school, upon purchaseing it and began to read it, the boredom set in immediatly. The actual Alien invasion portion was somewhat interesting, kept me wondering what was going to happen next, however when nothing happend and the book set into another long dry spell, i was left bitterly dissapointed. The end of the book had some redeeming value, however it is no where near enough to make me ever consider reading it again. The story was pretty good, but poorly executed"
4,Kindle Daily Deal comes through!,"Bought this as part of a Kindle Daily Deal for novels that were made into movies, along with Wyndham's other book, The Day of the Triffids. Enjoyed both books immensely. Wyndham had a way of thinking about the reality of a science fiction premise, if that makes sense. He thinks of angles on the premise of a village of mind-controlling children that surprise and entertain us. Truth be told, I enjoyed Day of the Triffids even more, although the movie made from it did not seem to enjoy the status of Village of the Damned."
1,DSM Quick Reference,"The book itself is fine, however, it is exactly the same book as the DSMDesk Reference which is confusing and lead me to purchase both thenhad to return this one. The DSM Desk Reference is spiral bound and nicer."
5,Slightly delay but was refunded most of the price and still got the book.,"The book was not shipped for 10 days. When I emailed the staff they told me they were training someone new, refunded me $10, and paid for the book to be overnighted. Overall a very good experience."
1,Lucite cutting blades(?),"I waited a week for these ""special"" blades to cut a sheet of 1/16"" plastic.I could have done better with a kitchen knife.They splintered and split the plastic to the point that it was worthless.I only rated it a 1 because the seller delivered it on time.Chips"
5,the best!!!,The best book Crichton ever wrote. It is interesting and informative. When the book ended i started crying
5,A thrilling court battle to rival Grisham fiction,This novel is a wonderful piece of work. Crichtontakes on reverse sexual harrassment and discrimination with ease. His extensive research makes the book enjoyable and an ultra-fast read. He leisurely walks through the complexities of our legal system and comes out shining with a novel challenging all traditional thought modalities. I would highly recommend this novel to any fan of law novels and shows. You will finish it quickly and then have the desire to absorb more of Chrichton's brilliance through his other novels. ENJOY!!
5,Disclosure finds its way to the top of the best reading.,Non-fictional story which stirs ones imagination and emotions. Sexual harrassement is reverse faced as the tables have turned on the male from an upper management female. The two had once been involved some years ago. Now he is happily married with a family. He finds himself tempted but resists. The ego of this woman detest rejection and lack of control over the situation. She convives and manipulates the situation to make him the quilty party. It is intense with excitement. A must for you libray
5,Bravo!,"WOW. ""Disclosure"" is an excellent book, not only for its story line but also for its plot twists and pace. Even with heavy technical (although outdated) info and legal jargon thrown in from time to time, the author makes sure the reader is never lost or loses interest. I found myself saying, ""just one more chapter and then I'll stop"" but I found that I couldn't stop (I read the whole book in a day -- something very rare for me!). This was my first Michael Crichton book. I'm sure it won't be my last."
3,Reverse Sexual Harassment,"A man is expecting to be promoted to VP of his high-tech company, only to be surprised when his former subordinate and ex-lover gets tabbed for the VP post. A power struggle takes place, and the new female VP tries to nail her former boss and currnet employee for sexual harassment. Fast-paced with a couple of good plot twists. Anyone entrenched in the cutthroat FORTUNE 500 corporate environment will not find this story far-fetched."
3,Interesting Commentary but limited,"This Commentary cannot replace Eerdman's for example as it is not nearly as comprehensive. It is a nice addition to a collection of commentaries but if you only want one, this is not it."
5,Hilarious and touching,"This book is laugh-out-loud funny in many spots and heart-tugging in others. It is an easy, quick read. Reminded me of a chick-lit novel, but it's a completely true, real-life memoir. It could have gone on another 200 pages, and I would have eaten it all up. Just buy it, you won't be sorry."
4,I really liked this book,I waited a while before I purchased this book. It was definitly worth the wait
3,Good lite read,"well told story, author was self effacing and told some good ""inside"" stories of the stars. found myself more interested in her story than the star stuff.."
4,Good Business Information,"This book gives the basics to running a business... business plan, budget, etc. I could already do all that stuff and was looking more for something to help me with a bakery. Honestly, I stopped reading. I will pick it back up when I have more time. The book also talked a lot about financing and investors. I just want to run my own bakery without going into debt... do it the Dave Ramsey way, if you know what I mean.If you are opening a bigger bakery or baking isn't your passion, but you think you can make money in it, then this is the book for you. If you don't have a lot of business experience, this is also a great book for you.I have not looked at the information on the CD yet. Sorry, I cannot give feedback on that."
4,good for someone who wants to manage a bakery,"This book is excellent for someone who plans on managing a bakery--having lots of employees to do the actual baking, serving on people, cleaning, etc. If you are opening a small operation with yourself doing the majority of the work, this is good reading for when you expand."
5,Great book with companion CD,This is a great book on bakeries and the companion CD has very helpful templates
5,When I heard that my friend T Lorenzo had a CD I laughed....,"T Lorenzo goes to school with me and he was saying that his CD was coming out soon....but it took forever....but after all of this the box came in with the CDs.....so I bought one and when I heard the CD I was very impressed with T Lorenzo and all the others who were on the CD......T Lorenzos' ""My Profile"" is my favorite.....and I think the group will be successful in the time to come....."
4,"Vivaldi: Cello Concerti, Vol. 4",The performance was excellent. The only reasion I did not give it a 5 was that the use of spicatto was not in the Baroque style. I still enjoy it very much.
4,Interesting book with real perspective.,"An insightful read. I work with animals and people, and it's nice to see basic animal behavior used and broken down while a true story is told. Not told by a professional in the industry, and instead someone who comes with little animal experience and moves through the industry with important questions. I enjoyed it."
5,From a graduate.,I was a graduate of this program in 1991. The book brought back so many memories. It also really gave an emotional look into what a student goes through. It also shows the different walks of life that enter into the program. I was able to really relate to the book since I knew many of the animals. I had two friends read it and even though they never met the animals felt like they had a connection. Great job!
5,Animal traiining book,Not yet read. Book arrived in timely fashion and in excellent condition for used book. Glad to use this shipper again.
5,Steamin'? Indeed!,"Out of that quartet of LPs (Cookin'..., Workin'..., Relaxin'..., Steamin'...) culled from the 1956 Hackensack sessions with that absolutely *definitive* lineup of John Coltrane, Red Garland, Paul Chambers, and ""Philly"" Joe Jones, this is my favorite. That swing, that joyous *oomph* they collectively create, is not just outrageously foot-tapping, it's almost enough to get me out of my seat and MOVE (and that takes a lot, me being an assiduous non-dancer)! One of my favorite Miles Davis albums out of the almost limitless catalog. What words can express my appreciation that music this good has been preserved for all time on a CD I'll enjoy for the rest of my life?"
4,a stunning performance,"This movie is one of the very few masterpieces of film history. A brilliant performance by a 24 year old Catherine Deneuve! To buyers who are not familiar with European movies: Try not to analyse this one too much! Watch and enjoy - think about it but don't look for a meaning where there might not be one! It would help to read the book by Joseph Kessler.... (Bunuel once said that Catherine Deneuve is ""as innocent as virtue and as dangerous as sin"" - and he proved it with that movie!)Glad to have got it on DVD. The reason I gave only four stars is that, unlike advertised by amazon.com, it does NOT come with an interview with Catherine Deneuve. Suggest that amazon.com takes this part out of the description. It is misleading!"
4,Some people are uninformed,Erotica? Please. Some shoppers should not be allowed to have credit cards.
2,Rent something else,"Your being persuaded by the praise written above largely depends on your already knowing and admiring Bunuel and Deneuve. For those of you who do not, you may well find, as I did, that this film is trite, predictable, and poorly paced."
5,Amazing!,"I got this for my cats, one is a short haired cat and the other is a medium haired.I never really had a problem with grooming the short haired cat. She'll try and groom herself when you hold up the brush. She loves this brush!My medium haired cat is another story. It was always annoying when I went to pet him because my hand would be covered in fly away hair. This brush loosens all the undercoat and collects it on its bristles. It doesn't take long for the loose hair to collect on the brush and then you can easily lift it off in one piece. His coat is left smooth sleek and shiny. I love being able to pet him and not end up with a handful of fur. And even better- he loves it too. He'll stretch and turn to make sure that I get all that itchy fur off of him."
5,good version,These two trios are well played on this disc. As usual with Saint-Saens the music is unfailingly tunefull and pleasant. The writing for the piano is particularly good -- perhaps because the composer was a pianist of some renown. I thought the sound quality was good but occasionally somewhat distant or veiled but certainly acceptable. Of course the naxos price is just right.
3,Better than the string quartets,"To judge from listening first to the Saint-Saens' string quartets and now these piano trios, I have come to the conclusion that Saint-Saens was at his best when a piano is included in the mix. Some of the movements were interesting and inventive, but some felt less creative on a first hearing."
3,"Does not cut 3""","I ordered this 8 1/4 skil worm drive saw with the intent of being able to cut through two 2x stock in one pass. But, it comes up short by an 1/8"". The annoying part is as advertised, will cut 3"" at 90 degrees. What they meant to say was 2 7/8"" at 90 degrees. Now I have a $200 saw that will last for 50 years that doesn't do what it was advertised to do. Did anyone at Black and Decker think to make the blades 8 1/2""? There's room. I will probably get the Big Foot attachment now to compensate for my small saw."
5,A real solution,"This book is written by someone who lived in the Middle East and knows that culture very well. He suggests realistic and doable solutions to the Jerusalm problem and Middle Eastern conflicts. I wish our politicians and policy makers in the USA read this book. If you want to read one book about this subject, this is the book. Don't miss it."
1,GET OTHER SPEAKES,"THE SPEAKES SOUND BAD, GET A BOSE SPEAKES OR OTHER BRAND. ONLY 8W EACH. SAVE YOUR MONEY. I GET THIS SPEAKES 1 YEAR AGO."
5,a very nice book,"this was one of the books required for my african american experience history class last term. this reading was difficult for me due to the content, but I was able to manage. I frequently had to take breaks when reading it, or else my emotions would start to go haywire and I'd want to go back in time and give them (whites) a good ass-whooping for being utter bastards..."
4,It's great but it's loud!,"This saw was purchased 5 years ago for its compactness to fit into a kit box. I did work in art direction & set construction on films at that time.I'm right handed so I love having the blade on the left for visibility of the cut. Be sure to keep your left hand clear!! Saws intended for homeowners have the blade on the right for greater safety.I found the motor housing to be in the way when using a guide to rip or crosscut plywood sheets. This was also mentioned by a previous reviewer.My major complaint is that this saw is very LOUD compared to the equivalent Porter Cable model. (I don't know if it's just my saw - there aren't that many hours on it. ) I would probably choose the P-C if I had to do it again. BTW I do wear ear protection.This saw's benefits are compact size, light weight and power."
4,Great if you are looking for a lighter saw,"Very solid piece of equipment. I was looking for a lighter saw to use for cutting plywood to size and this fits the bill nicely. It is much easier to handle than my old, heavy Craftsman saw. I was also looking for a corded saw because keeping up with battery technology is getting expensive and I don't need the portability for this tool. Poewr is good, and overall I am very pleased with this saw."
4,The Mighty Mite,"90% of the work I do is installing doors and windows in older homes. I use this saw to cut siding back and interior trim to allow for the new windows or doors to fit properly. This saw is perfect for this. It is light weight and the right size to get into those tight spaces. It hasn't lacked in power to do any of this. The one disappointing shortcoming of this saw however is it will not cut all the way through a 1 3/4"" door. It lacks an 1/8"" at the most to be able to do it. I have to pull my 7 1/4"" saw out for that. You should also be careful of the base. My saw fell from 3 feet onto carpet and the base bent on the corner. I was able to bend it back but be careful."
1,WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME,I purchased this camera and was very disappointed. The camera did not work verywell and the support was nowhere to be found. The video was blurry and the knobs were difficult to use. I returned the camera and have yet to recieve a refund from them. I am in the process of filing a complaint with better business burea. My credit card company is also working to get the refund. Don't waste your time or money on this junk.
1,Hello....hello.....is anybody there?,"I bought this phone for the features and price Uniden offers their products at. The old addage, ""buy cheap, buy twice"" couldn't be more applicable in this case. I may have only spent [$$$] on the unit, but I would need to spend another [$$$] for a pair of Miracle Ears to hear the person on the other end. Don't waste your money on this puppy!!!"
2,Okay for a basic discussion on composites but not if you want to know how to DIY,"I found this book to be of limited value. Discussion of design is very basic and only helpful as the most basic of an introduction to aircraft design. You will certainly not know how to design an airplane after reading this book. Nor will you gain the insight needed to build with composites. I would only recommend this to an absolute beginner in the field. Even then, I think there is just too little good knowledge to be gain. Perhaps time (& money) would be better spent on the aircraft design books from Chris Heintz, Dan Raymer, or Zeke Smith."
4,The Twisted Root,"You have to expect something dark and evil when you read Perry. I read six of her books before I really developed a taste for her talent. The end is a little less unexpected than usual. Her talent is more involved than a mystery writer, she weaves a tale of another time, another place. She is a great teller of stories. This is not her best work but her second best is still quite good enough"
3,My first and perhaps last Anne Perry read,"This was the first time I've read Perry's novels, and at first, the story and characters delighted me. But soon, plot twists and characters started to fog up the story. There were too many side characters who didn't propel the story, too many POV switches (""head hopping""), and too many asides about the Crimean war. The story meandered along, moving slowly through the clues and testimonials of each character, and then screeched quickly to a halt with a barrage of new evidence and a story line that seemed contrived and strange. The main characters seem to be Hester and Monk, but then at the end, the story ends with no discussion by them, no reflection on the turn of events. I was left wondering what the point of the story was. While Perry has a fine grasp on Victorian times, I learned more about what not to do as a writer than anything else. Perhaps there are better William Monk novels out there...if this was the best, I'd steer clear of the whole series."
4,Another excellent examination of Victorian morality,"The newly married Mr. Mrs. Monk become embroiled in a nicely complex mystery, steeped in Victorian morality. a missing bride-to-be, a nurse taking her belief in healing outside of the confines of her hospital's notions of what constitutes proper medical care, and the struggle of Perry's newlyweds adjusting to their new lives together combine to create an intriguing and thought provoking adventure. Perry's ability to capture the time period is exceptional; she not only creates a proper setting but her presentation of Victorian morality, particularly in the medical establishment's attitude toward the nursing profession, is exceptional. It serves as an interesting history lesson as well as and good mystery.While the mystery itself is sufficiently complex to interest a reader, the ending is a bit rushed after the long set-up. But all in all, this was a good read and a nice addition to Perry's series."
4,A good insight,"Although shorter than I had hoped, this film allows outsiders a brief and rare glimpse into Haitian Voudoun ceremonies and practices. Sadely Maya was not the person who finished and produced this film, but I think those who did, did so in a loving memory to her, and I think she would be pleased. This is a excellent follow up to reading her book, ""Divine Horsemen."""
3,Cultural Enlightment,This film was an interesting insight on an ancient religion that is just as viable as any other.
5,natural products,arrived on time and love the natural product would recommend to any one who likes products with out chemicals in them
2,Doesn't work,Love the smell. I love the idea of organic. I live in Alabama and this product is no match for the humid summers here.
3,Nice Ten Minute Smell,"I love this deodorant but to be honest, it only lasts until the front door! If you want to feel fresh all day buy one for your pocket or purse"
1,The Same Old Stuff,Beware the liberals are after your children. They will brainwash them with Harry Potter books and all the psychological test available to them. They may even attempt to manipulate their self-esteem. A real whaco read. The authors web site really reveals where she stands.
5,The best expose of psychomanipulation since Hidden Persuader,"I read this as the finest exposé of psycho-sleaze since Vance Packard wrote 'The Hidden Persuaders.' 'Cloning' is not light reading: it belongs in the study, not on the coffee table or in the bathroom.The author relates in detail what the methods of the Educrats are and what they accomplish. Every honest member of school boards everywhere should study this exposé--and learn the wisdom of rejecting Federal aid for anything.There! Put THAT in my psychoprofile!"
4,Another fine Fred Astaire film...!,"A brisk, enjoyable Fred Astaire flick, which features Fred and Red Skelton as the prolific Depression-era songwriting team of Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby, who wrote standards such as ""Whose Sorry Now,"" ""Nevertheless,"" and ""I Wanna Be Loved By You,"" known for its ""boop-oop-a-doop"" refrain, sung by squeeky-voiced Helen Kane. Astaire and Skelton play things pretty low-key in this straightforward potboiler; Skelton is particularly likeable with his big-lug interpretation of Ruby's personality and Astaire... Well, he's just Astaire, which is to say he's great -- wish maybe he'd danced a bit more in this one. The music is nice too, especially when they sing as a duet; the movie's only downside is the drab female leads, Arlene Dahl and Vera-Ellen, both of whom are a bit dull, and don't sing that well. All in all, though, an entertaining, pleasantly nostalgic film, well worth checking out."
5,the best method book for clarinet!!,The one and only method book for learning the clarinet. If you want to learn scales and get your fingering faster this is the best book out there. it is music history.
1,Old film which I should have known better to bother with.,"You get what you pay for. Just because this movie came out in the 70s I thought it would be better than this. Some of the movies from the 60s and 70s are pretty good but not this one. Don't recommend watching this, it is just a waste of time."
4,'' The Magical Page Turner'',The Master Puppeteer is a mysterious thrilling book about a bandit named Saburo who robs the rich and helps the poor! There also is a boy in the story named Jiro who devotes his life to learning puppetry.Meanwhile the puppet theater crashes by a mob of rioting peasents.Jiro becomes aware of his responsibilities greater than his craft.He schemes to safe his friend Kinishi and his parents.While he does this he stumbles upon a great and powerful secret.
2,Good for wood.....,I was recommended this glue for mosaic and it does work well if you are gluing glass on wood. If you are gluing glass on glass it DOES not dry clear as the manufacturer says. I was very disappointed with that. I will use it when gluing on wood.
3,A Mixed Collection...,"Raymond Carver is one of my all-time favorite short story writers. This brief collection gives some of his best, and some of his lesser works. My favorite stories here include the title story, ""So Much Water So Close To Home,"" and - perhaps my favorite - the quasi-horror story, ""Tell the Women We're Going."" Carver's lean style captures the feel of the America in which he is writing; his characters are usually suburban and lower-middle-class. They are cynical and frequently disillusioned by love - yet there is still hope coming through.Some of these stories don't feel finished though. They stand merely as slices of life. ONE of them definitely isn't finished: the story, ""The Bath,"" would later be expanded into one of his most famous stories - ""A Small, Good Thing."""
2,Not so good,"To those who say they ""levitated"" when reading a Raymond Carver story, Marlon Brando--when told his acting could ""capture moments""-- said to the PLAYBOY interviewer: ""A prostitute can capture a moment. A prostitute can make you think nirvana has arrived on the 12:30 plane, and it ain't necessarily so."" Above all, Carver is writing for other writers. I would bet anything most of the people praising this book below are writing students, writers, or professors. It's incestuous writing, with all the meta-fiction cliches for the coverted. Hemingway--to his eternal credit--in a letter to a publisher, said, ""My stories are intended to appeal to high brows and low brows BOTH."" Hemingway, of course, wrote brilliant stories. Truman Capote is a famous writer, but his short stories get little attention. I implore you to read Capote's short stories before you inflict Carver upon yourself."
4,Almost great...,"Dead Hollywood Stars is a group of Belgian musicians who have filtered themes of the American Southwest through their electronic lens. The result is an innovative fusion that fits categorically with works by the likes of Wim Wenders, Robert Altman, Ernst Haas, and Sam Shepard, albeit with much darker tones. However, I just can't get past the inclusion of the final three tracks on this CD. This potential masterpiece of a concept album loses its coherence with Track 8, and by the end of the CD, the listener is left with a slight feeling of disappointment for what could have been."
2,"You get what you pay for: this media burns at 2x, not 4x","I have an NU Tech DDW-082 dual format (+/-) writer, firmware version B370, and while it burns other brand DVD-R's at 4X or higher, it burns these Ritek's at 2x. The results are reliable and they play well in my Panasonic RV-31 DVD player. But these are not 4X disks, no matter what the label says."
4,Nice Saw for not so big jobs,"Good saw for the money. It is messy and noisy, I advise it to be used outside. But perfect for the smaller job."
3,"MK 157222 MK-170 7"" Tabletop Tile Saw","THE MK-170 IS A LITTLE LESS THAN WHAT I EXPECTED, BUT IS FINE FOR THE WEEKEND DO IT YOURSELF PERSON. IT IS EASY TO SET UP AND MOVE AROUND. DO NOT USE IT INSIDE, OR IN AN AREA THAT WOULD BE PRONE TO WATER DAMAGE, SINCE THE SAW THROWS WATER ALL OVER."
2,not for me,"the head does NOT travel and the fence is poor , i wanted to like this saw and had low expectations but it is just too poorly thought out for me . didnt even plug it in"
3,MADE IN CHINA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I BOUGHT THIS SAW THINKING ""IT'S MK, MADE IN THE USA."" WRONG!JUST GO TO HARBOR FREIGHT AND BUY ONE."
5,atonement theology for the oppressed,"Weaver's book does a great job of addressing the question of, who does our theology hurt? The introduction to this book was enlightening and especially pertinent to setting up this question. The focus on an atonement theology that contributes to the ""machine"" of the world (violence, racism, patriarchy, etc.)is one that he correctly takes dead aim at. While we realize this oppression in religion, culture, and education, our theology is often lacking in this same awareness. Comparing where mennonite theology should be in relation to women's and black theology is a project that is vital. A good book that really challenges the theological conventions that we take for granted"
5,A journey to Tir Na Nog,"In Irish mythology, Tir Na Nog is the home of eternal youth. Which is fitting, because ""Into the West"" is a movie for those of us who remain young-at-heart. That may sound cheesy, but my 6-year-old brother couldn't sit still long enough to pay attention the first time we watched this movie. My sister and myself, who were in our teens when it was first released on video, were completely captivated. In fact, the only thing remotely wrong w/ this movie is the way it was marketed when it hit theaters. The trailers didn't provide a clue as to what this film was about, or the magic it held. The 2 young boys are marvelous actors, and Gabriel Byrne is very good as their loving, if miserable father. The lyricism and fairytale quality to the film are spellbinding, and the ending may very well leave you tearing up. For a full evening of Irish folklore, watch this in a double-bill w/ ""The Secret of Roan Inish."""
4,Into the West,The story is about two boys who find a magical horse and how the adventure unfolds as they try to return the horse to the sea (as folk lore has it).A movie for the whole family to enjoy. Two brothers help each other on this quest of saving the horse. The adventures and mishaps makes for strong bonds as they head for the coast. It is also a story of how their father rediscovers his heritage and saves his sons.
4,Great for french manicures,"I have been using this white to make the white tips for my french manicures. The consistency is sort of chalky, but overall, I like it. It does what it's supposed to do. I will purchase this again :)"
2,Suprised,When I first heard that Jason Statham and Jet Li were doing a movie the first thing I thought was that it wouldn't be that good and that it woudl be filled with over the top 'kung foolery' (have to give Scott Levy credit for that saying). But this movie wasn't bad. It wasn't great but it was worth a watch and it had a few suprises that I didn't expect. And it did have enough martial arts to keep a fan of the genre interested without driving off other people who don't get an instant erection from two guys doing their 'Matrix' act.
2,One of Jet Li's WORST Movies Ever,"Before continuing with the review, I would like to note that I am a huge fan of Jet Li and Jason Stratham. However, I am not a fan of crappy movies with a horrible plot and storyline that doesn't make sense. If this were Jet Li's first English speaking movie, maybe I could excuse his horrible lines and limited character development. However, this is like his 20th movie in America and this is several steps down from where he should beI saw this movie when it initially came back, so most of it is a blur. But I do remember my negative feelings about itand I'm certain this movie is not worth buying or watchingDO NOT RECOMMEND"
4,Gangs All Here,"I was expecting a great showdown of martial art mayhem between Jet Li and Jason Statham. What you get is a somewhat compelling story that has a great twist at the end that you never see coming. War contains some great action scenes and moments of ""I can't believe they just did that!"". The extras on the DVD are okay. Deleted scenes don't include anything outstanding and are probably only a little over a minute long all together."
1,Can someone please stop Jet Li from making anymore bad Hollywood films?,"This one is horrible. Messy plot. Bad script. Poor acting. And sad to say it comes from Jet Li, who has just won Best Actor for Warriors in Hong Kong. Jet should stick to Mandarin films... Hero was an Oscar nominee, Fearless was critically acclaimed and Warriors winning accolades.For John Lone, I really miss him in the Last Emperor.For Davon Aoki, even the playing a bikini clad samurai princess in DOA was better."
1,Does Not Work,This disc refuses to play in either of the bluray players in the house.This one convinced me to stop buying them until they fix the technology.
2,Bad Movie,it was like a huge episode of CSI.....lame. very lame...i fell asleep it was so boring. waste of a blu-ray :\ jason statham and jet-li can do way better than this....
1,terrible horrible and little action,"I enjoy action movies and have liked Jet Li and Jason Statham in movies in the past, but this was terrible acting and not enough good action to make up for it. We got this as a treat for our teenage son who'd just gotten off of a grounding, and we feel that we did him an injustice by having this be the first movie he'd seen in two months. It was bad enough that the acting was terrible and the plot predictable and stupid, but the cookie cutter shootout, car chase, cycle chase and, considering the abilities of two of the stars, boring and too-few fight scenes made this one of my least favorite movies of all time. We apologized to our son for having this be the first movie that he'd watched in two months. Don't even think of renting this, never mind buying it, unless you have a grudge against someone and are getting it for them."
2,Good movie. horrible ending.,This movie provides a lot of action sequences that are well choreographed. Its story seemed to have been given a lot of.thought as well as the musical score.....all the way up until the end of the movie that is...The ending did not live up to what the movie builds up to. One of the worst fights between two action superstars I've ever seen... You would think a director would give jet Li and Jason Statham better highlights than that...
5,Great Must-read Resource,"With 30 years of travel experience, the author knows what she is talking about! She provides lots of great tips and explanations about hidden charges and charges that get added on. Some of the information is pretty basic, but overall, I learned a lot!"
3,CAMILLE DONATACCI'S HUMOR & SHAPE MADE THIS MOVIE,"A GOOD SPOOF ON OLD TIME ""WHO DONE IT MYSTERY'S. CAMILLE DONATACCI'S ROLL AS ANNIE O'SHEA WAS PARTICULARLY COMEDIC. SHE USED HER COMEDY ABILITY'S (PROBABLY ASSISTED BY HER HUSBAND KELSEY GRAMMER)AND HER EXQUISITE FIGURE TO PULL THE MOVIE OUT OF THE MERE ""R"" CATAGORY. NICE JOB CAMILLE!"
4,Great Photos So So Info,"The photos in this book are awsome , just wish they were in color. Nothing covering electronics, some good info on how too's just not enough. If you are looking for a book with lots of black & white photos of museum quality models this is it."
3,Just so parents are aware---,"While this is a darling book and while most of the poems and prayers are Bible verses or Christian-themed, I think Christian parents need to be aware that there are also prayers from other religions featured in this book, some of which state directly or inferentially that all paths that lead to God are the same.. ie, the "" many paths, same destination"" type theology. If you disagree with this, don't buy this book or buy it and tear out the few pages that deal with these subjects."
5,Excellent for sinus problems,I rarely find a homeopathic solution for my sinus issues but this one is it! Very satisfied with this product.
3,very temporary relief,"This kind of works, but briefly - I'd probably have to spray it in my nose a few times an hour which is not only inconvenient but medically not recommended."
5,"Good, helpful product",Was turned on to this stuff many years ago. I use it to combat occasional congestion successfully as well as during the winter (especially) to keep my sinuses lubricated. Works well.
1,This is for verion 6 of Ultimate not the most current version,"They don't say that this is for Verion 6 (two versions ago) It is a lot to spend for a video that is for an older product. Ultimate 8 is a great piece of SW but really takes time to learn so I thought that this DVD would help. While it did show me a few things, to me it wasn't worth the money."
4,"glad i bought it, works just fine","I almost didn't buy this for my 1590 after reading all the other reviews. I'm glad i did buy it. As everyone else has said, it is just a bit of metal and some plastic, with a little metal clip, but it works fine for precise parallel cuts in mild steel and stainless steel, and I'm sure would work well for wood too. Saves me lots of time setting up and aligning guide rails for cuts like I was doing before.For sure it could be made of all metal (hence 4 stars). But it is cheap, fits my 1590 perfectly, and does the job very well, and I'm sure it will continue to do so as long as it is treated with a little care."
1,Junk!,"I ignored the previous reviews and ordered this anyway. What a mistake. I didn't pay much for it, but whatever I did pay was a waste! The plastic broke within seconds (literally) of opening the package. I haven't even used it yet. If you have a few extra dollars lying around, they would be better utilized by giving them to a panhandler than buying this ""product"". It isn't even worth returning- do your self a favor and skip this one."
5,Great Entertainment & Versatile!,"My newborn loves the swing, & you have the option of playing soft aquarium-type music and/or a light show for baby. It's also very portable ... a definite plus."
4,New Mom,"My family members all had the full size swing. So, when I saw that they had a travel size I was happy! My son is 3 weeks old and he loves to go in it. At night when he doesn't want to sleep I put him in it. He falls to sleep in 5-10 mins. The only down fall is that it dosen't allow for a newborn. His head always falls to one side. I had to go out and buy a head boppy for him. I put that on the seat first, and then his head is restrained from falling to one side. Other than that one flaw, he loves the lights and the music. I would recommend this to any new mom. It's also nice because you can fold it up and bring it with you to a sitters if you needed to. I would purchase this for a gift, but get a head boppy to go along with it."
2,ONE POSITION SEATING,"MY DAUGHTER LOVES THE SWING, BUT IS STUCK IN ONE POSITION. THIS ONLY COMES IN RECLINE POSITION."
1,Possible safety issue. Don't buy,"I originally had the deluxe swing and my baby loved it, so much so he wore it out. I immediately went to purchase another and found only the Aquarium Take Along was avaliable. I am concerned about it's safety, as it pushes his chin to his chest and also allows his head to lean to each side to the point it rests on his shoulder! I believe this is set up for airway impairment. I will be returning this item and will not purchase another Fisher Price product with the same seat design."
2,Mediocre at Best,"My daughter was almost 3 months when we needed this swing and about 16 pounds. At her weight, even at the highest setting, it barely moved. There is also a music option and even the music was barely audible. We tried new batteries and still did not work well. FYI - all her 'non portable' swings still work without any problems, even at their lowest settings."
4,Cute swing,We ended up buying two of these swings....one for my mother's house and one for my mother in law's. They are very cute and with all the lights and sounds it is entertaining. It just does not recline enough for a small baby or a baby that wants to sleep. It becomes uncomfortable and their little necks are bent to the side. They are really nice for a little bit but for the money you can buy a full size swing that easily folds that reclines.
1,AN UNKNOWN DANGER,"My daughter got her head caught between the two side rails (the white plastic & blue metal), so the swing was swinging hitting her head, causing her to cry. She was only 4 1/2 months when this happened. Prior to this she did enjoy the swing, but it seems like an unknown danger can occur, I recommend the other fisherprice take along swing (our friend has it) it has more room so she can't get her head stuck, and she likes it just as well."
3,my baby wasn't too fond of it.,It just sits there in the corner. My baby gets bored with it real quick. He doesn't like it to swing. He would rather just sit in it and pull on the hanging toys. That's it.
1,DON'T BUY THIS...,"We purchased this for our daughter when she was around 2 months old to take to Grandma's and other travel. She was not happy with the reclined seat. She wanted to sit upright more and the seat is not adjustable. After taking it to Grandma's in the stored position, it quit working. New batteries were tried and nothing worked. It is expensive for an item that will not work after it only being a month old. Use your money wisely and get something else!"
2,"Great concept, poor quality","I have this swing. I LOVED the concept. I have the cradel swing and bouncy seat as well, and both work GREAT. But, I've owned the swing for 6 weeks and it just up and died on me. No explanation. When I called the store about it, the mgr. told me what the prob. was w/o even talking to me or seeing the swing. That told me this swing has known problems, and I'd encourage everyone to spend that $60 on another product (like putting it towards the cradle swing). JMO"
4,Great portable swing!,"My 4 1/2 month old daughter has enjoyed this swing since she was 1 month old. Early on, she took 2 hour naps in the swing. Now she delights in the lights, toys, and music. I can easily move her from room to room in the swing while I cook or get ready to go somewhere. The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is because the batteries need changing too often. Maybe that is only because we enjoy using it so much?"
1,THIS SWING IS A DANGER TO YOUR INFANT,"I received this swing as a shower gift. I do have many of the Ocean Wonders line of products and have been very happy with them, but this item needs to be taken off the market. My son is almost 8 months old now and I have probably used it two times since I brought him home from the hosptial. Everytime I have put my son in the swing his head has always fell to the side and almost got wedged between the bars. THIS SWING IS A SERIOUS SAFTEY HAZARD TO ANY INFANT. Also the seat sits to straight up for a new born, if any thing this swing should be for an infant at least 6 months or older. I THINK THEY SHOULD RECALL THIS SWING AND I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS SWING TO ANY MOTHER OR FATHER!!!!!!!!!!"
3,A treat for fashion fans!,"Fans of this runway king will enjoy this biography. The man behind the threads is as fascinating as his clothing line, and if this book has a fault, it's that there aren't enough photos of his sensational clothes. Lauren's taste and style are legendary - he seems to be one of the few fashion designers who actually likes women! Roll on, Ralph."
3,"Interesting premise, sputters at the end","Interesting premise - the time quilt effect leading to chunks of the past exchanged with chunks of the present. While this is a good 'hook', the book leaves a lot (A LOT) of questions unanswered. Why this time in the past? (because dinosaurs eating people are cool) What happens to the people that got sent back in time? (good question) What is that on the moon? (Another good question) Did Atlanta come back? (Who knows). These are only a few of the unanswered questions in this book. On the positive side, the characters are interesting and consistently portrayed, and as noted above, it is an original idea.However, the number of unresolved subplots outweighed the positives in my opinion, leaving what could have been a great novel only an average read."
4,Life will never be the same again...,"The whole world goes back to a wilder time when dinosaurs appear on earth. While the President tries to figure out how the fix an unfixable problem, people throughout the world are forced to cope with some perplexing and unexplainable...guests.James F. David skillfully introduces the reader to several scenarios where people are faced with finding ways to survive often in their own backyards, while a plethora of animals from another time move in.""Footprints of Thunder"" will entertain you as well as challenge your assumptions about the future."
2,A Roaring Yawn,"I picked this book up because I have a weak spot for any book that dares to cross genres. Unfortunately this one really just lacked any ""wow"" power.The plot really seemed a little weak, but even worse, was what I felt poor character development. There were quiet a few characters to follow and I never really empathized with any of them even when they were devoured or maimed.It wasn't the book I was hoping for and was by no means a Jurassic Park (not the greatest book but better than this). I highly doubt I'll pick up the sequel."
1,Does not live up to expectations,"Did not last one year despite careful installation and following all grounding guidelines exactly. It does not contain a user-replaceable fuse, so any short requires a return to manufacturer. I would not buy again, and would not recommend."
3,sams review of Dive,"DIVEby,Gordon KormanMy book is Dive. The book is about four teenagers that are chosen by a professor to dive and explore the sea. They aren't sure why they are there, but they know that they're looking for something big. The other divers are covering up something, and they don't want Star, Dante, Adriana, and Kaz to know.I think this book makes people think about what could happen next. That is one of the reasons why I like it. Another reason is that you don't know what they're hiding until a little more than half of the story, and you want to find out so bad so you're on you're toes! The setting of the story is out on an island in the Atlantic Ocean.( I didn't tell people what they're hiding, because they mignt want to read it, and find out for them selves.)"
1,BORING!,First of all I want to say this book was just all over the place! I didnt really know who the main characters were and where the story was headed! I usually dont have bad opinions of books and tend to like at least a little bit of all the books I read. But I have to say this book was just horrible I was struggling to finish it and then finally just gave up a little more than half way! I would not recommened this book to anyone!
2,Bosch Mini-sander belts,"This is a situation where you have yo buy a poorly designed product because there is no alternative. Don't get me wrong the sander itself is fast, great for removing old paint from tight places like shutters. But the seam on the belts almost always breaks before the grit even starts to wear out. I suspect the glue is affected by temperature as the plate gets very hot at higher speeds. Only at the lowest speeds does it seem to last. I wish I could buy a sanding sleeve and cut it down, but the Bosch belts are metric. Bosch should obviously redesign their seam , maybe in a zig-zag rather than plain diagonal, and absolutely change to a glue or tape that is unaffected by heat."
2,Didn't hold my attention,I was very disappointed with this book. It held my attention for the first 100 pages and afterwards went downhill. I felt I could relate to the stories in the beginning but after that it just seemed like nonsense. I think I was looking for a man to bridge the gap between women & men with miscarriages. Or maybe I was looking for more medical information and what is being done. I defintely did not find either of those topics in this book.
4,Based on a horrific true story,"PVC-1 is a thriller film based on the true story of Elvia Cortés, a 55 year old woman from La Palestina, Boyacá, Colombia, who in May 15th, 2000 had a pvc bomb attached around her neck after she refused to pay a $15 million pesos ($7500 dollar) extorsion fee to allegedly FARC rebels.This movie was selected and shown in the 2007 Cannes festival where it won the ""Award of the City of Rome"" award and has won other awards in festivals around the world.The movie was financed, directed and shot by Greek-Colombian director Spiros Stathoulopoulos, who spent 3 months, 5 hours a day of physical training to endure the 85 minute long, one-take steady-cam digicam shot that became the movie.This is what makes the movie so remarkable, it is a single camera, 85 minute long shot that never lets go, no edits, no multiple takes, no gimmicks, just pure acting. Being a one shot movie, this means everything had to be carefully planned and acted without mistakes.Highly recommended."
5,UNBELIVABLE,Alizee is red hot ... and Moi Lolita is her best work by far ... i think this work will go down in history as one of the all time greatest clasics of our time.
5,A Story of Sshamanic Vision and Healing,"This is another installment of excellent literature from the pen of Sandra Ingerman. I have read many books on my spiritual journey. Sandra's books rate as some of my favorite. A fall to Grace is an excellent teaching story. As story I found the book full of suprises and totally engaging. As a metaphor for ""everyone's"" healing journey this book excells. Healing often requires a realistic look into the mirror of our souls. A Fall to Grace not only provides the mirror it also points to the road of transformation."
5,Warm feelings,"This is a sweet story about compassion and sacrifice. I love the illustrations. This book gives me a warm feeling. I love it more than my 2 year old but an older child would probably appreciate it, too."
4,EXACTLY WHAT I ORDERED,"Everything came to me exactly as i ordered. However, once i received it, i realized that it was not the FULL edition. The covers look the same so maybe some heads up would have been nice. Great condition though, and was shipped on time. No complaints with the seller."
3,"2 3/8"" Large Ice Cream Scoop by Fox Run","I like the size of the scoop. But there is one problem I have noticed. The mechanism for the scoop is ""sticky"" which makes it difficult to squeeze and it is jumpy when you release the mechanism. Personally, I would not recommend this product for anybody who has problems with their hands."
5,Fabulous Selection of Scarves,"This is a great book, small in size so easy to take along. It has a fabulous selection of scarves and shawls. I am interested in making every item in the book, unlike some books where you only like one or two patterns in the whole book. This is a *must have* for those that like unusual scarves."
1,What's the Big Deal?,"What a piece of crap this game is. I cannot believe I paid so much money for it. The directions included in the game do not tell you how to play, or how to get around. We're stuck in Jimmy's Lab and have no idea how to get out. Can someone tell us how to get out? What a piece of crap."
4,An entertaining film,"A British surfing film - surely an oxymoron - and nothing like typical American surfing films.Surfing is only the backdrop and it is more about the lives of a group of friend and some tourists from London whose paths cross in a small seaside town.Zeta-Jones does what she does best - plays an ordinary (but wonderfully pretty) girl, while the rest of the characters are an array of oddballs.The humour is very British and this film will appeal more to those of an anglophile nature.Both funny and sweet, this film was cruelly overlooked by reviewers and cinema-goers alike.Once the price comes down from the stratosphere, this is a worthwhile purchase."
4,Kill a few hours!,"My first Hoag novel; she's got a way of making you relate to these characters. Maybe its the plot, or maybe its the author's creativity, but your rooting for these characters throughout the entire thriller."
3,ok for a poetry book,"Had to purchase this book for English class otherwise, I would not purchase a poetry book."
1,Great Disks Bad Batch???,"These are the Ricoh disks, which are one of the best. However, these had a lot of physical defects that could not occur in the package - may have been repackaged??? The lot codes on the disks were all different until i got down about 15 or 20 - I looked through about 45. There was no clear plastic protector at the bottom and the wrapping on the outside was a real flimsie saran wrap stuff - not the usual tough plastic wrapper. I have ordered two 100 stacks from newegg and both were good - not this one though. I am forced to return the disks there are so many bad ones.dave"
5,Excellent DVD Media!,"These are rated 4X but will burn at 8X on my Plextor 712a without a problem. As mentioned before, these 4X Ridata are RICOHJPN01 whereas the Ridata 8X +Rs are Ritek G03s which have been problematic for some burners with firmware that wasn't updated. Ritek is by far superior to Memorex, and the rave reviews for Memorex were probably for their RICOHJPN media whereas now, it's more likely made by inferior CMC or Optodisc. The comments about the poor packaging and shipping by Amazon are true! A few measly air bags in a soft cardboard box that looked like the UPS guy kicked it all the way to my front door. The spindle case was cracked and chipped, but it was too much trouble to return. I'm just hoping these burn as flawlessly as the previous spindles."
2,Risky Ridata Purchase,"Beware that you're playing the odds by buying the Ridata cakebox from Amazon. My spindle came with some disks with physical defects which made the DVD's unreliable for storing information. My previous purchase of this product from Newegg was defect free. The data that I store on my disks is precious enough to me that I don't want to risk burning faulty copies. If I had to do it again, I'd spend a few more dollars and get defect-free DVD's from somewhere else. It's a crap shoot whether you're burning reliable DVD's with these media."
1,lasts about 3 months,"I have owned two of these cash registers. The first one lasted about 1 year, and the gears where the paper feeds through are faulty. Over time, they stop linking and the paper feeder doesn't close, therefore it doesn't print on the paper. I figured our business beat it up and didn't care for it properly, so I bought a replacement 3 months ago. The same thing happened, I couldn't believe it. I switched over to Sharp. I don't recommend this register at all."
1,Not user friendly.,"If you're not a rocket scientist, DO NOT buy this cash register. The Sharp version is easier to program."
2,cash register,Not user friendly. Our previous sharp cash registers were not as complicated as this one. Everyday we have an alert problem with it's codes.We really should have stood with Sharp registers.
1,We wish you a Brady Christmas,"This was the first album released by the Brady Bunch. Unfortunately, it was also their worst album. I could mention the dull arrangements of traditional Christmas carols here. But worse than that is the kids' singing. Marsha was the only one who could come close to carrying a tune at this point. To be fair to them, they worked hard and later became better singers. But at this point in their show biz careers, listening to them sing was unbearable. Greg's singing on ""O Holy Night"" is particularly painful. By the way, this album is only 20 minutes long, which is fortunate, because that's about all a sane person can take. This album has nothing to recommend about it. Sorry, Brady fans."
1,One of the worse biographies of all times,"I have been reading a number of ""Bestseller"" biographies (Lincoln, Washington etc). This version of Cicero by Everitt is one of the poorest written bios I read so far. The only good thing going is that it is thin (p325), but unfortunately I am having problems completing even this thin volume. I am now at page 160 and debating on whether I should continue or not.To be fair, the first 50 or so pages introduces the reader to ancient Rome. Being unfamiliar to that era, I was able to keep up engaged. However, I was expecting to learn about Cicero as a person but I am getting more of a ""history of Rome"" when Cicero was around. Boring...This book is only useful for those who want to recite some tid-bits of Cicero/Ceasar/Pompei etc; you might as well Google it. One lesson I learned from this book is that if you want to write a 'bestseller', get a publisher who will aggressively do marketing for you. This book is definitely overrated."
4,cicero,"Very impressed with the speed at which the item managed to get delivered to me here in the antipodes. Nice book, seems to be well written [havent finished reading it yet!] and very succint."
5,Great biography,This is the third book written by Everitt I've read. As with all the others he makes the subject of the biography come off the pages along with all the other personalities of the time. It's as if sometimes you're reading a newspaper of the time.
4,History that reads like a novel,"A fun way to gain an insight into Roman history. In this book you don't get to meet just Cicero but also the likes of Caesar. You will also be introduced to Cleopatra and Mark Antony but you will have to read the author's book about Augustus to find out what happens to them.If you only have the time to read only one popular book about Roman history I recommend ""Augustus"", because this one leaves you with too many important loose ends at critical point in Roman history."
3,I'll Split the Difference Between the Prior Two Reviews,"Well, I agree the anonymous reviewer needs to remove the wax from his or her ears. This is a lovely CD, the pianist gives very sensitive performances, with the restraint that this music deserves. He resists the temptation to schmaltz it up. The orchestral playing is fine, too. Certainly not deserving of censure. My only quibble, and this is where the anonymous reviewer's point is taken, is that the sound quality of the recording is muddy. In this day and age of recording technology, inexcusably so. It reminds me somewhat of the early Nimbus recordings in which a deliberate effort was made to replicate the sound of hall in which they were recorded. They pulled it off. Naxos didn't. Fortunately, this is outside the norm. Most of the Naxos discs I own, at least those from the mid 1990s though present, are splendidly recorded."
2,It didn't work,I bought it to connect a laptop to a Samsung LCD TV that doesn't have S-Video but RCA and HDMI. I used a S-Video extension cable connected to a Dell laptop but I could never get the video signal in the LCD TV. I didn't try connecting the laptop directly into de TV set because the adapter is too short.
1,poor quality,"i thought the capture card i was using was screwed up, but then i realized that this cord was making the quality worse. whoops."
3,Could be worse,"I understand that you cant get S-video from certain devices unless you pull it right off the main board. I mainly got this because the Composite Yellow jack went out on my TV and I wanted to play my NES. For that, it works, its not true S-video...its composite first and foremost. If you want REAL S-video...mod your electronics to do it."
4,Amazing Saga,"I started reading this saga several years ago and it sucked me in. Ever since then, I've needed to read more and more. Raymond E. Feist wrote these books with such vivid detail it's almost as if you are there in the story. This book is so suspenseful that it urges you to keep reading. I would recommend this book and the rest of his books to fans of medieval story play and magic story play. Phenomenal book!"
1,Too much of the same,"Found this book uninspiring, lacking excitement. Pugs character very weak. Too much dialog not enough action. Too much of the same storyline from past books. Disappointed enough not to read the next two books."
4,More Midkemia; seems more and more tame...,"This book by Raymond Feist is very much part of his normal formula for books. His books tend to focus around the creation of young male characters and how they develop their talents to move the world in there own ways. Feist continues the adventures in the fantasy world of Midkemia with visits from some original characters and various other characters that have appeared in his other works. Pug makes another appearance as well as Nakor to continue Feist's exploration into the balance of good and evil.This book is just a plain fun fantasy book. If you have liked Feist's other works you will most probably like this one as well. I did find this one to be less worthy of praise than his others works. Magician was by the best of the books produced and the Serpentwar Saga was probably the best series, this just doesn't stand in the same league."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Boys, blackguards and power armour army.Pug and Nakor have more of a starring role here as they realise that the threat owned by the Talnoy (basically magic robot power armour battle suits) and their masters is bad news indeed. Pug's sons, both magical and non-magical are involved, as are the couple of kids they are mentoring, enabling Feist to bring in yet another pair of young brat identification characters, if you like.Fans of the magical types specifically may like this one more."
4,Entering the circle,"The recordinng sounds a little bit ""90s"" but very intressting to hear Olga on a CD."
4,A great place to start!,"This book enabled me to put my gut feelings about UFO's in some sort of context. This book changed the way I think about UFO's, Revelations, and the entire Bible. There are certain issues in the book where I feel the author missed the mark, but overall it is an incredible study. Anyone who has enjoyed reading the ""Left Behind"" series should wake up and see where the real danger lies. There are so many books like this one in print, but this is a real easy read to see if you are interested in this type of journey. A must read for everyone!"
2,NOT A SCARY MOVIE AT ALL!,"i was expecting a scary movie, i fell asleep : ( a big dissappointment from what i had expected. fast delevery though."
2,A not-very-interesting-approach into research techniques!,"masters or Ph.D. students are in a continuos quest for TIME ... reading this book takes a lot of it! (about 400 pages). however, it could be a good book for relaxed researchers, with many useful tips( it addresses historians mostly), so a researcher of another discipline might find himself passing many pages like i did. good chapters on: ORGANIZING: PARAGRAPH, CHAPTER, AND PART / THE ART OF QUOTING AND TRANSLATING / THE RULES OF CITING: FOOTNOTES AND BIBLIOGRAPHY. it is a well known book in it's fifth edition, but the truth is: I did not enjoy reading it very much !"
4,"The many ""actual size"" photos are amazing!",Don Johanson typically gives great respect to the data and unfolding evidence of his most fascinating field of paleoanthropology. Lots of good up to date detail. But this book is different from all others in that David Brill's photos are truly mind-blowing...as close as one can come to viewing the fossils in real life. A must-have for any hominid-junkie.
5,"Quiet, solid, powerful","I got this router sometime back and it really stands well above the others I've used. It is well balanced, the motor lacks the whineing howl of many, which is quite a relief if you use one for a couple of hours. Sturdy and easy bit height adjustment. Cuts without hesitation. It will be one of your favorite tools."
3,Runs good - Looks bad!,"When I first got my 1816EVS it came out of the box with a little discoloration on the motor housing. Cranking it up, the router ran and proformed so well I didn't let the appeance bother me since this is a working tool and I was sure using it a lot. I have had the router about a year and the discoloration just keeps get worse. It took me ten minutes to remove the motor from the base last week because of the oxidation of the magnesium housing. I can not believe no one else has reported this problem, but then again even Bosch will not reply to my inquiries. Could it be time to go back to PC?"
3,Bosch 1618EVS Safety Problem,"The Bosch 1618EVS is all it is cut out to be. This tool is top of the line, but there is a major safety problem with the ""lock-on button"" in the D handle. To ingage the lock-on button I had to use an ink pin or small piece of dowel for continuous operation (the pin is too short and does not extend from the D handle) Bosch should replace the ""lock-on button"" with one that is a bit longer before someone is seriously harmed. Because of the safety short fall I must give this tool three stars."
4,Great hand held router,"I purchased this router on a recommendation of a fellow woodworker. Overall I am really satisfied with the router. Do plan on adding a tiny bit of lube between the base and motor for smoother adjustments (thus only 4 stars). Other than that, the soft start is great. Power is smooth and delivered. And the D-Handle is a must have for safety reasons. Even with one hand the router feels much safer than the knob versions out there. The weight of the unit isn't too bad, so this one can be held for durations without issues...This router is has a variable speed knob on the top making it yet even more useful.I own several Bosch tools and I haven't had any problems with them. They continue to work, job after job."
4,Smooth operator w/ trouble prone switch,Very smooth motor. Soft start ramps router up to speed smoothly. Very good power. Do not really care for D handle routers. Thought I'd try it. Really just wanted the EVS motor from the router for my router table. Did not work to well in table as switch works only intermitately in table because of dust. Switch worked fine after blown out w/ compressed air. Milwaukee 5625-20 production router now resides underneath my benchdog router table. Well made router that gets a one staer demotion for faulty switch. Now motor gets used in my fixed base/plunge base 1617 kit when I need variable speed.
2,Cropped,WARNING: This is a shortened/censored version of the film (at least compared to the one we have seen in Europe
4,An Epic Western with Gunfights Galore,"Brilliantly weaving classic western themes into tantalizing backstories, unfolding through the interactions of allegorical characters that represent legends such as Calamity Jane and Billy the Kid, combined with the most duel-style gunfights of any movie in history, this is a singularly wonderful work of western cinema. I've seen The Quick and The Dead at least a half a dozen times, and I've loved it more each time. This movie makes your heart beat faster, touches a myriad of emotions, and provides the unique entertainment satisfaction of classic westerns such as The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly; The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance; and High Plains Drifter. Indeed, The Quick and The Dead is a ""must own"" for anyone who loves westerns or action films. This is a movie that receives a lot less attention, favorable reviews, and fame than it deserves. It's a guilty pleasure in which I richly indulge."
5,What fun!,"A lot of people got a good career boost from this movie. I think this is Gene Hackman at his bad guy best. From sunglasses to power lines to dynamite, this is western parody at it's best."
1,"I'm sorry,","but this was one of the dumbest things I have ever seen. I saw it on TV and was telling a friend about how horrible it was but I couldn't remember the name. I went here to look up all of Hackman's movies and found the title. After seeing all the good reviews, I had to respond.I love parody as much as the next guy. This was just too stupid to be true."
3,"Sharon and Gene try, but it ain't no use","Well, if you combine some pretty good actors with an overblown story and details that you really wouldn't want kids to see, you come out about here. Considering what they had to work with, the people that made this thing could have made a much better movie. DiCaprio's character is obnoxious enough that you wind up thinking he gets what he deserves."
3,Quirky and Inventive Western,"Director Sam Raimi's homage to Sergio Leone and the spaghetti western was scorned by critics and audiences when it first came out. This film definitely deserves another look, though, on video or DVD.In a delicious performance, Sharon Stone appears as a mysterious gunslinger with a troubled past (the Clint Eastwood role). Gene Hackman plays her villainous nemesis, and a pre-Titanic Leonardo DiCaprio also appears. Stone hasn't done much worthwhile in several years now, which is too bad. When you see her play strong female parts like this one, you can see the promise she shows as an actress.The story in ""The Quick and the Dead"" is repetitive and the characters are mono-dimensional, but the direction is so stylish and quirky that it more than makes up for the bad writing. (You can't help but love flashy shots like viewing the action through a newly-shot hole in a gunfighter's hand.)This film will probably appeal most to film buffs and fans of the Western."
2,All My Junk Won't Fit!,"The instructions seem to indicate that all, every nut and bolt are supposed to fit through this very stiff rubber ring. Not so good for me. It's pure torture to try and not achieve success in stuffing it all through there. Not even one at a time. So, TAKE CAREFUL MEASUREMENTS with a string around it and measure it before wasting your money with this device. NO RETURN OF THIS MERCHANDISE! That's my advice. IF THEY EVER MAKE A 2 1/2"" RING, I'VE GOT TWO SMALLER ONES TO UPGRADE. Suggestions might include making it easier to stretch. This is nothing if not as hard as a hockey puck!"
3,Not so much party,"Being both a Matmos fan and a dance party fan, I was excited when I heard about this cd. I was hoping that it would be some sort of dance/glitch party album that would move my feet in a way I never thought possible. Unfortunately, Do You Party doesn't have a single dancey song on it. It does cause you to bob your head or wiggle your feet every now and then, but none of the grooves groove enough. Sure, it's fun and funny at times, especially on the first 4 songs of the CD, but overall the CD sounds like a more accessible Matmos CD rather than a party CD. I'd recommend DAT Politics' Plugs Plus for those looking for a dancey glitch album."
4,"Translation is good, Commentary is not.","The translation is excellent and the included art at the beginning of each chapter is beautiful. However, the Commentary is average."
3,This book has great realistic methods to today's war of life.,"I choose this rating because, this book shared great ideas. What I liked about the book was the story line and skill set and method how to defeat your enemy or gain control over most if not all situations. I would recommend this book to anyone who does not understand the strength of the mind and patients."
5,Comprehensive Translation of One of the Most Popular Chinese Classics,"The Art of War is a must-read book by anyone who love The Romance of Three Kingdoms, popular chivalry story based on the history of 3rd century China.I think it is a wise idea to read this Chinese classic from Thomas Cleary Translation. Had I encountered this from Archaic worded Japanese version I might not get so immersed into it. Cleary translation is really understandable even to non-native English speaker like me. Also it is great idea that the interpretation of notables including Cao Cao comes after the Master Sun's text. Comparing interpretation is really a fun.What I am impressed most about this book is it says that if you can avoid the war better not to fight. And its idea of how to manage an army is really close to modern idea of organizing groups particularly business corporations.Verdict: Nice gateway to Chinese classicsRating: 90 out of 100Recommended for wide variety of Chinese literature and classic books fans."
3,"Clear Translation, Poor Commentary","The translation of this ancient text was accurate and concise. The childish commentary and lack of analysis relegate this book to the coffee table, not worth serious study."
2,Only one day,"The seams are well sewn and did not come apart. However, the sound chip inside broke within just a few hours of playing with it. You can hear the plastic parts crunching and it doesn't moo any longer. Although the toy has stayed together (except for the sound chip) I still had to throw it out, for fear some of those crunching plastic parts inside would poke through. Very disappointing (and expensive) for just a few hours of play."
4,I love it and so does everyone else! Very powerful!,"I'm not much for writing long reviews, but it's worth the money and it doesn't dissapoint in the power department."
3,"Works as advertised, but for a limited time.","Was great while it lasted.Power cord failed after 1 month of use, but was replaced by the company at no charge. Second cord lasted much longer through extra careful use. However, the device failed completely just short of 2 years, and it was a hassle trying to get the machine powered for almost an entire year prior to the end.It is always a shame when a seemingly good product is undone by one of its most inexpensive components."
3,Not what i expected,This case looks great online and once i got it and tried putting my knives in it not all of them fit because there was only a limited amount of slack in the elastic. So i had to improvise and all my knives have pocket clips so i clipped them onto the elastic bands instead of having the bands hold them into place. The case itself is very nice and it will do a great job at protecting your knives from scratches and it is also a very nice display case once you have it opened.
5,truly undefeated,"Bob was my childhood hero, and so seeing that he had written an autobiography was like a dream that I never thought would come true for this private man in the public setting. However, he and his recently famous son Brian felt compelled to write a book that doesn't brag about their on-field exploits, but as a beautiful tribute to the person that appears to be their hero, Bob's first wife and Brian's mother Judi.From this book's pages I learned a lot about a beautiful woman, someone who graced the earth with her presence, and about the devoted love that her family members had for her. A wonderful, and funny, and touching book about love within a family. First, the Griese's and friends love for Judi, and then, the love that Bob and Brian had for each other as they tried to support one another.I can truly say that this book had a positive impact on my life."
2,This movie is so awful...,"This movie is so awful, that when the so-called action or dialogue slows down past boring, the actors have to hang out at a strip club to get the strippers in the scene. There are many cheap shots of the strippers, which do not add to the substance of the movie.This movie was neither funny nor witty. Forget this movie and get something else that will really entertain."
2,ICE BURG VICTIM OF GLOBAL WARMING:-(,THIS FILM HAD POTENTIAL TO DELIVER BUT IT IS NOT WORTH BUYING. RENT OR BUY FOR MY TWO .02 CENTS.
5,Great movie I loved it John Cusack is amazing,I love this movie. John Cusack was great. I watch this a lot all the time. That was great.
5,Why wasn't this in the theaters?,"I caught 1/2 this movie on HBO. Got up went to Amazon and bought it! Great dark comedy. John Cusack is really good in this and Billy Bob is,, you know... Billy Bob!!! Simply put, it's a great movie. The outakes are even great. Billy Bob rehearsing a scene as ""Carl"" (Sling blade)is a perfect ending to a great movie."
3,Rightfully-forgotten neo-noir,"The Bottom Line:A black comedy and noir riff that has a bit of a cult around it because it was directed by Harold Ramis, The Ice Harvest is really rather forgettable and not worth your time and money; there are a ton of similar, better films out there you should see before you waste time with this unimpressive outing by Mr. Ramis with a bland performance by Cusack in the lead.2.5/4"
4,It does the job,"I purchased this item in spite of the less than stellar reviews simply because of the availability and admittedly the cheaper price. The product arrived in a timely manner and the only complaint pertains to the tight fit of the wand but that has become better with time. We have been using it for over 6 months on a daily basis and have had no complaints. It's durable at a fraction of the price of the original. When this hose breaks as they all will, I will purchase another from the same company."
2,not very informative,"first, let me say that i'm a supporter of the whole reviving ophelia phenomenon. i really wanted this book to challenge that idea, and i guess christina hoff sommers does that, but it seems like it's more of a personal attack on NOW and the UAWW. this is probably good if you're an elementary school teacher and want to read on the subject, but it doesn't seem like there's a whole lot of what actually goes on in the outside world. as a girl who read reviving ophelia and was taken aback at how much i related to so much of it, it seems to me like christina hoff sommers wants things back the way they were. the world would be better if gender didn't matter, but she's not making it seem like this is going to balance things out."
5,Heavenly Revelations is Just Heavenly,"Hildegard von Bingen: Heavenly Revelations is just that. Heavenly. The voices blend beautifully. If you enjoy her music or any spiritual music, this CD will not disappoint you. It is perfect at Christmas or really anytime of the year. Although considered spiritual or choir music, her music does not have to be played as such. It can be played at the end of a stressful day and as a yoga instructor, I have even played her music during my classes, especially during Savasana."
4,"Amazing, but not what I was looking for","I bought this album to explore more tracks by Hildegard after listening to one of her songs on an anthology. This music crosses centuries, languages, and religions, I feel. I am not a Christian, and the reason I listen to Georgian Chant is to study, because it focuses my thoughts exponentially. It completely drowns out the noise of the world and helps to gather my ideas. This did not get 5 stars because it wasn't what I was looking for. I wanted to hear tracks with a mixed gender choir but this album only goes from single male/male choir to single female/female choir, on alternating tracks.This is still an excellent study aid and should be recommended for use as much as pencils and pens."
1,PROBLEMATICO,compre este movil y solo me ha dado problemas y el vendedor nunca se quizo hacer responsable...
5,Near Perfect Wagner,"I've owned these on LP and CD. The performances get raves from almost every reviewer. They are near perfect. Szell conducted 86 performances at the Met from 1942-1946, including 4 Ring Cycles in 1944 and 1945 (with Traubel and Melchior). He conducts with opera experience. What sets these recordings apart is that each ""bleeding chunk"" is played as if the entire opera was performed. Each is in character with the scene(s).The clarity on SACD is stunning. Major improvements in dynamic range and bass response. Pianissimi are barely audible. The brass is brash! Vivid sound stage. Having attended 5 Wagner Ring Cycles at the Met (Levine obviously patterns his Wagner on Szell), this recording now sounds like you're sitting center orchestra at the Metropolitan Opera house."
4,I love Zydeco!,I first experienced Rosie at the 2000 Essence Music Festival and fell in love with her sound! I just had to purchase some of her music and this CD is the best.
4,Emer Kenny,Emer Kenny's self titled CD combines haunting melodies with inspired lyrics. A must have for late night listening with the lights turned down low.
3,Psycho with an axe !,"This film has a similar mood as a whole compared with Alfred Hitchcock¡s ¡Psycho¡. First of all, main character of this film, John, he commits murder because he cannot get out of his wife¡s spirit. In this film, when John commits murder, he always wears a wedding dress. It is similar to ¡Psycho¡, when murderer commits murder, he wear a mother¡s cloth. Anyway, two of murderer is not normal they have an abnormal mentality. Most of thriller movies like these, usually as if these characters appear. Whatever the reason, the mood of this film is excellent. It is supposed to be a film with good background music and mood. Mario Bava, one of a great horror director, his films has a unique style. This film also is a one of his stylish films."
1,I know it's cheap....,"But this is pitiful!I understand the difference between cheap and well made items, and I specifically got this because it was cheap and looked pretty neat. But two days after I got it the orange ring fell off. For no specific reason. It happened over the weekend, so I hadn't even been at work to damage it or anything.Looks neat, but not worth the money, small amount as it is.Two thumbs down."
4,Clean Cuts,THe Bosch jigsaw worked beautifully right out of the box. Very satisfied with the performance after using it several times. Very clean cuts using the progressor blades that came with the saw.
3,"Great saw, hard to change blades",Most of the other reviews share this complaint: the blade change function is difficult and cumbersome. The black handle on top the saw flops around and won't stay in place. I advise others to look elsewhere for a quality saw.
1,NO HDMI INPUT,"I bought this system from amazon because the product description said it had an HDMI Input and Output connection.There is No HDMI input! In fact there are no video inputs at all.I wanted to connect my HD cable box to this system, then have one cable out to my HD TV. I never set up the system or even removed the speakers from the box. As soon as I saw it did not have an input I returned it."
1,BOOTLEG---BEWARE!!!,"This book is a cheap photocopied bootleg. The Schulkers family owns the copyright for the Seckatary Hawkins titles, but this publisher has photocopied an original copy and attempts to pass it off as an authorized copy. It has missing pages and pages too dark to read. Amazon should NOT be selling this!"
1,Very poor reproduction,"This paperback edition of the Red Runners is a very poor copy of the original book. While the story is readable, this scanned copy has many errors in the text, some missing pages, and no illustrations. It is not worth buying. The family of the author, Robert Schulkers, has recently reprinted this book in hardback with new type face, additional text, all original illustrations, plus new ones. If you want a really fine Red Runners at reasonable prices, contact the Seckatary Hawkins Club."
5,Is there another choice?,"These are the only blades smooth enough for any kind of finish carpentry. The straight teeth make all the difference in the world. From coping crown to the most extreme scrolling cuts, these blades are perfect! I haven't bought any different blade than these for years. If I can't find them in stock I'll do without rather than buying anything less than the best. If thinking about purchasing jigsaw blades, buy these. The only thing I would like to see from Bosch is the same blade a 1/2"" longer. But you can't have your cake and eat it too!"
1,Worthless Product,I only opened the jig saw blades yesterday. I tried cutting a 1/2 inchsheet plywood and it absolutely wouldn't cut. If this is any indication of theproduct that Bosch now puts out I won't be purchasing anything made by them.This blade is absolutely useless and a waste of money. Save yourself moneyand time - do not purchase.
4,Sympathy or Empathy,"Unguided Tours of Hell is a winner. Prose's character exposition through the limited but insightful internal monologues is witty and poignant. She delivers the characters in less than ten pages and develops them in the remaining sixty. It was difficult at times for me to know whether the attraction to this book was its delectable prose or the reflection of some of my own character flaws. The sensitivity of the story's background heightens the tension built by their petty interactions. While most times I just wanted to sympathise with the characters, the truth is, I could actually empathize."
2,"Not so good, whatever David Lodge and co. say","""Three pigs"" in particular, with characters Leo and Nina, is really pretty bad. I don't know how Prose has established such a reputation, but I know I don't want to read any more. Her lack of conceptualizing a work at the beginning, of being unable to make fiction beyond the tiresome and hideously predictable musings of these characters, really attests to mediocrity, not brilliance."
2,Disappointing,"In 'Guided Tours of Hell', Prose provokes disgust at Landau and annoyance with his unreal pettiness and insecurity, somewhat interesting on its own merit. She brings up much more compelling and disturbing concepts of sensationalism and exploitation of an event like the Holocaust, which, mixed with Landau's preoccupations, make for an interesting combination. The second story was a disappointment. Any interest lingering from 'Guided Tours of Hell' disappeared once I started 'Three Pigs in Five Days'. Prose, throw us a bone! The idea of a man messing with his woman's mind is interesting for a few pages, but our heroine is too abjectly pathetic. A joyless and tiresome read."
5,This is a beautiful book...,that contains both gorgeous images and excellent writing. Springer is an amazing photographer and this book compelled me to buy two of her pieces.
1,Feminist dismissal of Islam,"The author may know feminism well, but unfortunately not Islam. A feminist undoing of Islam based upon deception and trickery would be more accurate of a title. Only someone who doesn't know the Qur'an and Sunnah and have a connection to the scholarly heritage connected with them could fall for thinking that she represents Muslims or Islam in much of what she claims and concludes (and unfortunately may be the case). This is another saddening example of the trend towards absolute dismissal and lack of respect for authentic scholarship and subjugation of Islam into an arcane religion that can be defined along the lines of feminist or other philosophies as seen fit."
1,"Well-written, but weak proofs","I agree with her point, that men, have misused Islam to opress woman. I love her writing, so clear, so lucid. But, her proofs are very, very flimsy, getting weaker as the book progresses, citing more speculation and emotion than hard evidence. This is the first book that I read in my quest to learn about Islam. Thankfully, I've read many since then. The writing is slick enough to make me want to read her other books, but I am hesitant, because this one is a failure."
5,Great Cookbook!,This is a very nice cookbook that has a lot of recipes for entertaining that can be made ahead of time. I don't know ANY woman (or man for that matter) who wouldn't enjoy this book.
5,There is time to have a great party!,"I've had this book for about a week, and I've found some very interesting tid bits. Diane Phillips is indeed the ""Diva"" of do-ahead! I can't wait to put together her suggestions for the do-ahead thanksgiving. Just imagine, not getting up at the crack of dawn to start your cooking. With all the do-ahead suggestions and even the crock pot suggestions this thanksgiving should be the most relaxing one yet. Thanks Diane for the great book!"
2,missing some options,"I am disappointed.Many of the recipes seem oversimplified (e.g. the chili is missing any fresh veggies) and are all terribly high in fat content.There is not a single vegetarian entree in the book and many of the veggie side-dishes are sprinkled with ham, bacon, or other forms of meat.This would be good for a heavy carnivore/new cook... but, doesn't add to my repertoire (and I am not an awesome cook)."
4,Hard to play with brother/sister/friend!!!!,"This game is alot fun but it is a pain when playing it with alot of people as you can only go a short distance if all of you do not stay together. Everyone has to stay together and work as a team or you can not move through the game. When the computer plays one of the characters it does not do the actions required of that player, so you have to switch between characters, what a pain that gets to be. We like playing it, but we yell at each other alot trying to get everyone to stick together!"
5,'Royal Son Of Ethiopia' has my vote as best album of 1999,This is the best album of 1999 and possibly of the 1990's. Get this now. Essential.
5,AWESOME,"This is one of my favorite CDs' I am into HipHop but his is one of my CD that takes me out of that realm. Thanks Joan and Jeff. First heard the music on the movie 'The Real Blonde"""
2,A very big book with very little credibility,"I found this book in the sociology section, but it belongs among works of fiction. For instance, although the book is over 600 pages long, it contains no footnotes, a red flag to a critical reader. Alas, the author looses all credibility when he asserts that mentally ill people may not be ill at all; rather, they have telepathic abilities beyond society's ken. This book, however, is not a total waste; it is lurid and macarbe. Steven King fans would be delighted."
3,Just one problem,"My daughter loves this bouncer and so do I but we had one problem. The top and bottom carrying handles worked great until the bottom one cracked, I guess from lifting her around in it but thats what they say you can do with it. My daughter was still within the weight limit it lists. Where the bottom handle is, it is near were the batteries go and that whole plastic piece cracked and hung down, the fabric that is over it kind of held it in place. I should have returned it, but I threw away the receipt, so I ended up wrapping rope around the bottom piece and we have still been using it."
2,weak,"I used this once and the interface was clunky and the product just doesn't have much behind it. I think I only paid $12 so not a big loss but I am not going to use this tool going forward. Maybe it's me, I don't update my scores on a web site either, despite my best intentions."
3,Interesting Archival Document,"This is definitely bootleg quality, no if's and's or but's about it. Knowing that, though, I would say that this is an interesting and worthwhile historical document of one night in Vegas nearly 50 years ago. If you have a high tolerance for anthropological recording, there is a lot to be gleaned from this murky gem."
4,Still Around,"I read the Horse Clan series way back in 1982 or 83, when I was in High School. Personally I am surprised to find that it is still around. Even back then it was not a particularly popular book series, however I liked Howard's Conan series, and quickly fell for Adams Horse Clans. This book series is not for everyone, but if you like Howards Conan books, you might want to give Horse Clans a look. Often marketed as a sword and sorcery book, it fails to meet that mark by a mile, but it is a good (not great) sci-fi fantasy novel(s)... well good in my opinion and maybe not so good in the opinion of others."
3,Cynical but not to be missed,"Some realpolitik here. I can't say I thrived on this energy but I was curious, it wasfascinating to look at, and some of it rang true. It depends on what you're lookingfor. If you're pursuing work in a super-competitive field in business, it has somewords to the wise."
5,SWEET !,"This is the best Jig Saw I've ever owned, and I've had Makita, Milwaukee, Dewalt and Craftsman / B&D.; This is the best balanced of them all for doing any kind of crown molding installs. It's small body with a coping foot attached is by far the best time saver any trim installer could own.It does get hot when used for long periods of time, so watch your hands....Ouch!"
4,"Wonderful, but a bit big","I bought this saw and have used it a lot in refurbishing an old house. It is a powerful and excellent saw and it cuts exceptionally true even through very thick stock. The only problem some people might have with it is that it is quite large and heavy. I have large hands so this is not a serious problem but thank God I did not buy the even larger Bosch model which is REALLY huge! Also, changing blades is a pain if you do not do it all the time since the procedure is overly complicated. No wonder they put it on the barrel of the saw!"
4,Warm and Fuzzy,"After the death of our 14-year-old bichon, I sought out books to help me make sense of it all and reach a state of acceptance. This little book seized my attention because of all the stellar reviews.It's a nice book and a loving tribute to the author's pet. Though I liked the book, I found it a little too juvenile for my tastes. For me it is somewhat therapeutic if not taken too literally. Even the possibility of a pet's spirit continuing to share its warmth and love is comforting though.As a book to read to and share with a child, I think this book is excellent. I also like the idea of another reviewer to substitute this book for a sympathy card. It would make a great token of sympathy."
5,Perfect for someone grieving...,"I found my ""Forever Dog"". His name was Bruno and I lost him on December 20th, 2007. That day was the worst day ever. I can not even begin to describe the loss that I feel. This book and others like it, give me hope that I will see him again...that we'll be reunited forever. I just have to wait. This book came at a critical time and helped to give me some peace. I'd recommend this book to anyone having lost a beloved pet...but mostly to anyone who had to say goodbye to their Forever Pet. Know that you will be together again... Trust in that. It helps a bit."
2,"Great book, lousy service with Amazon","Been a long time since I've done business with Amazon and now I remember why. Ordered something next day air, paid three times the cost of the item to get it, paid for it, and the acknowledgement says deliver in a week. Call customer service and they told me that next week was next day?!?!?!? The CS rep sounded drunk. Asked for a supervisor, put me on hold for 30 mn and then cut me off.Won't be doing any more business with Amazon. They blew it again. I'd rather pay more at Barnes and Noble or Best Buy."
2,Title is a misnomer,"The author obviously put a lot of work/research into the book BUT it really has NOTHING to do with food STORAGE. I feel that the contents, though interesting, do not match the title. I was interested in a book on food STORAGE - not additives, etc..."
4,"Red Firecracker, Green Firecracker was a beautiful movie",It told a story of love lost in a way that makes everyone think about how it would be to live in those times and not be able to choose who you want to be with.
3,"Interesting, Visually Apealling, but Repetitive","I enjoyed most of this film for its memorable, complex characters, artistic feel, and gentle telling. Its look at the status of women and the sacrafices they make for power and family is compelling. The major downfall of this movie is the director's failure to realize that about two thirds of the way through, he has already finished telling the story."
5,My daughter loves her baby papasan,This is the only thing my 4 wk old daughter will let us put her in. She won't even stay in her crib without screaming. If we didn't have the papasan I'd never get anything done. She happily takes her naps in it. My husband wants one his size & we love that it's so portable.
1,Did I get a bad one?,"I must be the only person out there that didn't like this. Actually, I liked it just fine, but my daughter hated it. She sat very upright in it, and the strap was the only thing keeping her from sliding right out. All of her weight was resting on her pelvic area. It was awful! She fussed every time I tried to put her in it, so it promptly went back to the store. When I returned it, the cashier said that my daughter may not have been heavy enough for the Papasan and that was why she sat so upright. I don't know about that... She was born weighing over ten pounds and this thing is marketed for newborns. Oh well, great concept, but the seat could be more reclined. We're sticking with our Fisher Price bouncer--love that!"
2,not as comfortable as it looks,"I am a mother of 4, I have tried sooo many ""cute and comfy"" baby chairs of just about every sort, this Baby Papasan was the least of my favorites, first of all the cushion for the baby's head is too propped up, second my baby would slide down to where if he would kick, the back of his foot would hit the metal area where you turn the music on/off, which made it very uncomfortable for him. At the time of use, my son was about 1month, then tried it again around 4 months, both times unsuccessful. If you do decide to purchase this chair, I would recommend you to look at it first at a store."
1,Waste of money,"We thought this would be perfect for our baby and it looked so cute. That is where it has ended though. We have only used this a few times and now have a used bouncy chair that she loves. I would not say that she is an overly fussy baby but this chair is not for her. I would recommend getting one that bounces as well as vibrates.1) does not recline enough, baby slides down.2) the strap system is not as quick and easy to use as some. If the baby is sleeping you will wake it up when putting on.3) music is not very loud or audible4) Vibration is very suttle, too suttle.5) just is too boring for a baby, the bouncy seat gives them extra stimulation when needed but not when it isn't."
3,bad head positioning,i received this for my shower and when my daughter was born i tried her in it. i found it held her head in a scrunched position with her chin to her chest. maybe when shes bigger it will be better but shes 2 months now and it still isnt working too well and soon she will grow out of it. good concept though just change the head position.
2,Very soft but not comfortable for my baby,"I bought this chair for my newborn daughter. I thought it looked very cozy and was so soft. It is very stiff when you seat baby in it, it doesn't conform to their shape like it is supposed to. I put it away for a few months and tried it again. She was 9 pounds at the time and 23 inches and her feet dangled off onto the floor. We tried rearranging her but she just couldn't get comfortable. I ended up giving it away. What a waste of money it was!! She hated it!!"
2,momof2,"My little guy liked this seat okay if he was already really sleepy and I propped it so that he didn't slide down so much, but the vibrating feature died several weeks ago and he is only 11 weeks. We changed the battery to no avail. A rather disappointing performance."
4,PERFECT FIT,"My little one LOVES IT! She sleeps so well in it, we don't really use the music or vibrating function but never the less the is very, very content in it."
2,15 Minute Warning,"As a new mother, I'm always thankful for any amount of daytime sleep that my baby takes. I put him in this seat from the day we returned home from the hospital. He loved the vibration and the music. Problem is - everything turns off after 15 minutes - which causes him to wake up and cry. I don't want him to rely on the vibrations for comfort - but 15 minutes is too short of a time for the chair to turn off. After 7 weeks of frustration - I went out and spent another $50 on the Eddie Bauer relaxing bouncer - and he's as happy as can be. I thought I should warn other parents about this chair - since it doesn't advertize that it turns off automatically on the box. I wouldn't have bought it if it had."
1,Beautiful but not functional,"We registered for this seat before the birth of our second son because we thought it looked really cozy and we liked the soft colors. The problem is that he never fit right in it. It sits the baby at a weird angle and he couldn't sit comfortably. We were so excited when we got it at the shower we opened it and threw away the box or alse I would've tried to return it. I kept trying to use it hoping that it would be better as he got older but to no avail. Besides being awkward to sit in, it has no toys and no way to attach toys to it so it really provided no help to me! We ended up using our first son's $20 Fisher Price bouncer and it was wonderful and well worth the money and it came completely apart for easy storage and travel! Go cheap on this one, but make sure it has toys or something to stimulate baby!"
1,Extremely uncomfortable,"I bought two of these for my new twins thinking they would enjoy their own little seats, but neither one will tolerate this seat for more than a few minutes. The angle is wrong causing the babies' heads to be pushed forward onto their chests, and no amount of seat padding or propping up the legs alleviates the problem. Also, the harness actually suspends the babies in a most uncomfortable way...they are actually 'hanging' on the chair putting pressure on the babies legs and bottoms. Terrible seats...do not waste your money on them."
4,Very Good Bouncer!!,"My son really likes this bouncer. It seems like it's very soothing for him. If he's fussy, I put him in and let him get a massage, which he seems to like because it calms him down right away. The only thing that I'm disappointed with is that he's growing out of it at 3 months old, but then again, my son is in the 95% tile. If you try this massager you won't be disappointed."
5,LOVE IT,I tried regualar bouncers with my little girl but she did not like them. This one cradled her and made her feel safe. It was a life saver. She feel asleep in it many times when I could not get her to sleep other times. It does have a timer on the vibration and the music is so soothing that I wanted to sleep also.
3,pretty good,"This is a pretty good chair, but not so good for a very small baby. The headrest isn't adjustable or removeable, so it tilts the head forward against the chest, making it look like my baby can't breathe! However, now that he's bigger, it is wonderful. Be sure to strap them in, though, or baby will slide out if he's active. My son will sit there for a while, but when he kicks his legs he slowly slides out. I have put a pillow under the bottom legs to tilt upwards, and that works, but it would be nice if the legs were adjustable."
2,Boring for Babies - Would be Great Idea for Adults,"I put the papasan on my baby registry after looking at all the bouncers in the store b/c it looked so comfortable. But naively I was only thinking in terms of my own non-baby experience, and mistakenly thought my baby would love how soft it is. I was majorly wrong. My daughter is 3 months old & she has never been interested in this & will wake up and cry even if i put her in while she's sleeping. I'm taking it back to the store & buying a regular bouncer. I would recommend that instead of the papasan."
4,Wrong color numbers!!!,"I've heard some numbers are wrong, so the design doesn't come out as shown in the book. Be careful to buy the right thread color!"
4,Low RPM for Wood Drilling,"As well-built and durable as the Milwaukee reputation would have one believe. I've had mine for 12 years now, and it's still growing strong. The only gripe I have is the low max RPM which is not particularly the best for drilling wood. I bought the Milwaukee hammer-drill for some concrete work, and since that has a higher maximum speed, I use that most often now. I save the Hole-Shooter for when I don't want a high speed such as for hole-saws, Forstner bits, and drilling metal."
5,Tough stuff,"This is one tough drill. I've used it for everything from driving 4"" lag screws to mixing mortar, and everything in between. You just can't slow this drill down. But as one of the other reviewers mentioned beware of the torque, this thing CAN hurt you if you're not paying attention(it's nearly gotten me quite a few times)."
5,Very good rotors,Replaced the rotors in my Jaguar. The slots add style to the wheels and the braking power is smooth. The fit is excellent.
4,Cute as a button!,I received many compliments when wearing these shoes. I almost felt guilty--like I had on slippers at work!! I purchased the pink and brown and was very pleased. The item received 4 stars because they do not have a lot of support-but they sure do look good!!!!
4,GOOD SEQUEL,"ESCAPE... set up, with wit and cleverness, this very good sequel, which delivers on the promise of Planet I and Planet III. We actually experience the development of the apes as members of society, and the screenplay handles deftly and with outlandish, bold strokes, both racial and societal issues. It is colorful, interesting and features once again the delightful Roddy McDowall as Caesar, son of Cornelius and Zira. As a teenager, I was captivated by this story, and this movie turned my world upside down. As sequels go, this one stands up on its own: with a new vantage point, the original story provides more than enough steam to let this story cook all by itself."
4,Pamela's cookies are fun and good,"Being a fan of Pamela's products, I had no hesitation in trying the chocolate chip mini cookies. These remind me of any store-bought, traditional gluten-filled chocolate chip cookie in that they taste normal and are not chalky and dry like so many other gluten free cookies out there. I like the size of these cookies because you feel like you are getting more out of your snack than one signle larger cookie. They are the perfect size for my children (who also love them) and the chocolate doesn't melt too fast and make a big mess. Yum!"
2,NOT MY FAVORITE,"I was expecting something a little more snappy and a little less sandy. The flavor was okay (I personally love strong ginger flavors, which I am yet to find) however, they were too sweet for my tastes. I don't know, but it seems like Americans have a strong taste for excess sugar. It would have been better if there was less sugar and more spice, as well as less sandiness and more snappiness, imho. For those who like chocolate, try the extreme chocolate cookies, but be careful as they may cause burning of the stomache; esp. if many are eaten. Not my favorite Pamela's product."
2,"Not-So-Great, in my opinion","I guess I'm weird. This is the only Pamela's product that I did not like. I love the full-size dark chocolate-chocolate chunk cookie, but the Simplebites had a bitterness I just did not care for. My husband (who eats gluten) liked them much better than I did.I'll let all you 5-star folks have these; I'll have the Simplebites regular chocolate chip mini cookies, or the aforementioned dark chocolate chocolate chip cookies, thank you very much."
3,IT is okay but I like the chocolate chip better,"This is coming from a chocolate lover. I ordered the ""extreme chocolate"" cookies thinking I was up for a challenge. Well, they are good but not great. I can't believe I'm saying this but the chocolate is actually overwhelming. I'm saving the rest of the bags to make a chocolate crust for my cheesecake but I won't order this type again. I do agree that it almost tastes like the top part of an oreo but with more intense taste. My husband hated them and my 3 year old wasn't fond of it. On the other hand, I have been ordering the chocolate chip flavored ones. They are awesome! It has a perfect balance and a hint of vanilla. My family loves it and even my co-workers too!"
3,New Version of a Classic is a Disappointment,"I've had an original single-speed AEG version of this 2.4 V cordless driver for 15+ years and have been very happy with it. I've had to replace the battery several times over the years (the Milwaukee batteries fit), but that's to be expected with NiCD batteries.I recently ordered the 2-speed Milwaukee version in a case with 2 batteries and a chuck. Unlike earlier examples of the Milwaukee package I've seen, the charger in this new package does NOT have the drop-down side door with 3 screwdriver bits inside. In fact, the package has ZERO screwdriver bits included - a BIG mistake in my opinion. In addition, the Jacobs chuck included with my package is defective. It arrived gunked/rusted and wobbles a great deal. I plan to return this set and stick with my old single speed driver."
4,Kobe's Incredible Life,"I chose the book, Kobe, because I love basketball, and I was interested in knowing more about the life of Kobe Bryant. I was surprised to learn about Kobe's upbringing and background because it was totally different than what I had expected.I liked this book because it tells all about Kobe Bryant's love for basketball, and his determination and drive to improve his skills. Kobe's basketball career begins when his family moves back to his hometown in America. The book also contains a lot of really cool pictures.Learn about how this young star athlete developed into an all star basketball player. Joe Layden does a terrific job in revealing what makes Kobe a superstar. I recommend this book to anyone interested in basketball. It is very inspirational!"
4,Amazing!,This album is a definate must have.It has everything you would expect from the spectacular Monica and more. The songs are beautifully composed and have real meaning behind them. She has really out done herself on this one.He soulful vocals contrast perfectly with the rhythmic beats on this album to create an immaculate composition.
5,W.O.W!,"Despite the trouble with her previous import CD (All Eyez on Me) which was only released over seas, due to illegal copying and sharing, Monica returns to the US Billboards and Radios with a huge impact. The CD features several markings of Miss E, Missy Elliott, and that only adds to the albums fulfillment. After the Storm contains several great pieces, which one even features Monica Arnold's rapping skills (featured on ""Get It Off"" [featuring Missy Elliott and ""Dirt Bag""]). Monica's debut CD which featured her hit duet with Brandy ""The Boy Is Mine"", was a more pop-based album, but ""After the Storm"", nearly half a decade later shows that Ms. Thang, really has what it takes to take on the other up and coming, and the already established female R&B artists!"
3,It's Okay,"I had to listen to this CD at least five times before really liking it. I was mislead by the first single So Gone. I thought I was going to hear more hard R & B songs that had edge to them, but most of the songs are mediocre. I really don't think this is the best R & B album this year not by any chance. She has a long way to go vocally and musically. This album is maybe a couple steps to her becoming a good artist overall."
3,MONICA'S THIRD ALBUM IS JUST OKAY,"I waited and waited and waited for this album to be released and when it did, I was kinda disappointed. I think that Monica should've released this album last year when it was titled ""All eyez on me."" I heard the album ""All eyez on me""(which only was released overseas) earlier this year before she released ""After the Storm"". Monica thought that if Missy produced her CD, it would sell but so far, the CD has been certified GOLD. Both her first and second albums were certified triple platinum. I think she should've stuck with Dallas Austin when it came to producing her albums. I know sometimes everyone wants a change but it's like the saying goes, ""If it's not broke, don't try to fix it."" There are a few good songs on the CD though. I like the song ""Hurts the Most"" and I like the duet she did with DMX. Overall, this CD is okay but I expected more from Monica."
3,Kinda Disappointed,"I am a big Monica fan and I was greatly looking forward to this album since she came back from her absence, but I was upset that it wasn't ""better"". I expected more from this album after she'd been gone for so long. I like it, and the songs on the album are enjoyable, but it's kind of depressing. Many of the songs are very slow and sound sad, even the love songs. Don't get me wrong, I still love Monica; I think she's a great artist, but I was looking for more from this one. Maybe next time.If you really want a good listen...get Beyonce instead of this one..."
2,It's not her best work,"The cd was okay, but nothing to really brag on. She has maybe three or four good songs out of 13 tracks and this does not include her bonus cd. Her first cd was way way better than this one."
3,Ok but there are better female artist albums out there.,"The album is ok, but doesn't have anything really special. Beyonce's albums just seems better to me, and ashanti's is just horrible. I would rate this in my list of females new albums.Beyonce, 1st,Monica, 2nd, Blu Cantrell,3rd, and Ashanti, a distant 4th."
4,Good old Fashioned R&B with a little Hip-Hop Flavor,"This album was pretty nice. What I like most about it is that through the changing years of r&b music Ms.Thang never loses her real true story telling approach. she has a beautiful voice and always brings nice music to support it. I like most of the tracks, but there were maybe 1 or 2 songs that I care less for, but overall this album is really good. It celebrates love, heartbreak, and finding happiness all over again. Nice album and nice come back. Keep doing your thang Ms.Thang."
2,Mmm...whateva,"When I first heard about Monica's new album comin out, I went out almost immediately to get it. I wasn't too much of a fan of ""So Gone"" but I decided to get the CD anyway since I liked her previous albums. (Plus she from the ATL so I gotta represent my hometown)After hearing about the first 5 songs, I was ready to take that CD back.... I was like ""What...is this?"" This isn't what I expected from Monica at all. She talks about the same things almost everybody else talk about and the songs aren't original at all. The only songs I really liked were ""Breaks My Heart"" and ""I Wrote This Song"". Other than that, you can keep the rest. So if you wanna listen to something worth yo money, pick up Lil' Mo or Beyonce cuz Monica ain't cuttin it."
5,I love Monica's growth on this album,She has matured and her voice sounds so refreshing! I have to give you 5 stars!
2,I know nothing,"I know nothing but when I turn the knobs that tighten the strings they dont stay tight, I know that aint right. they just turn back to where they arent tight enough for my liking. this cant be right. what ever its for my 6 year old daughter I hope she enjoys it. personally its like anything else in this world you get what you pay for. it looks nice but really I must say its cheap."
3,Ok,The are ok. Once before the heads would come off the handle while in use!!!This becomes a real pain!
3,Worth seeing for the,"Adrienne Barbeau plays a scantily-clad dancer who can control the minds of rats and calls herself The Queen of Vermin. When aspiring author Bram Stoker (Kevin Alber) is kidnapped by her secret cult of (also scantily-clad and dancing) women, he agrees not only to write of their exploits but also to aid in the killing of ""piggish"" males. Men aren't the only ones targeted by the evil queen: When a rodent with four left feet can't keep up with her flute music, she puts the rat's head in a tiny guillotine and ruthlessly severs it. He's like the Marie Antoinette of rats. Need I mention that Burial of the Rats was produced by the infamous schlock-meister Roger Corman? Based upon a short story by Bram Stoker.Staci Layne Wilson"
1,North and South,I won't be able to review this book until I can find one with print that is big enough for me to see. I would like to have known how small the print was before I made the purchase. Another reason I mourn the loss of real live book stores. Very disappointed.
3,be prepared to get a new glasses prescription,LOVED the book--but I am not sure why the publishers felt like they had to scrimp on the number of pages and squish everything into 6 pt font! The BBC movie is just as or perhaps even more lovely.
5,Well-written novel set in England.,"Very enjoyable reading. This novel follows a family who moves from rural Southern England to an industrial center in the north. There they meet with differences in social customs as well as economic philosophies. The author does an excellent job of pointing out the misunderstandings and conflicts that arise from this situation, without making either side out to be the ""bad guys."" I'm still reading this one and am enjoying it as much as ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" and the Jane Austin novels."
5,Masterpiece!,"This book is amazing! If you enjoyed Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, you'll absolutely love North and South by Elizabeth Gaskell. It is a must read for the fan of English period novels."
4,Social commentary as well as love story,"Gaskell is less well-known than she deserves, though recent miniseries of several of her works are helping to redress the balance. ""North and South"" is a powerful but accessible story, with strong characters and a vivid setting. Gaskell manages to include a wealth of information on social and economic conditions of the day without becoming didactic.Margaret is a fine character; strong and self-possessed, and willing to entertain new ideas. Which also describes John Thornton. They have real chemistry, right from their first meeting. Her large cast of secondary characters are also convincingly drawn.The author says in a note that she was ""was compelled to hurry on events with an improbable rapidity towards the close"" due to publication limits, and that does show. The body count becomes rather distressingly high, and the lovely lingering progress to the inevitable conclusion becomes breakneck. But that certainly doesn't spoil the reading experience."
3,Review of publishing quality,"I really like this book, however, the quality of the Vintage paperback is not as good as it used to be. The paper quality is a little cheap and feels more like a trade quality paperback."
4,North and South (Oxford World's Classics),After seeing the BBC production of this book I was anxious to get the book and read it for myself.
3,An interesting study in class.,"This book was recommended to me by an English teacher when we were discussing Jane Austen, whose novels I was in the process of reading. In many ways this is superior to what I have finished of Austen. This isn't a novel about a bunch of women who are just trying to get hitched. The main character is a strong woman in a believable manner, but her misfortunes remind me of Dickens Oliver Twist. What is interesting is the way Margaret associates, and brings together, the working class and the ""masters"" of industrial England. But to me the novel seems overly long and slow to develop. This would be fine if Gaskell had Dickens talent with words, so you could enjoy the use of language. But if historical fiction of this age is your cup of tea, this book is for you."
2,How Ironic,About as relevant to modern recording as the magazine now is to modern times. Recommend you get your insight from more enlightened sources.
5,john,"had this book,sold it at a moving sale,love this book,it is so much fun to read. i love how the knock all the BAD LPs that should have never been produce and the come up with the words of insult for them. long live the freedom of the press!!!!"
4,take the good with the bad...,"I don't eat alot normally, but I've always had a slow metabolisim. I started taking this 6 months after giving birth to my son when diet and exercise were not working. It gave me the boost i needed. I not only lost the 7 unwanted lbs, but lost a total of 12 extra lbs. The down side (and there always is one with ANYthing) is that it makes your heart feel like it's going to pop out of your chest. 2 capsules taken at once will make you feel coked out of your mind, but the end result makes it worth it. I noticed that I didn't feel anything after I took the pills UNTIL I started exercising. this may or may not be the case with everyone."
5,Awesome Shredding!!,"I usually found that most guitar shredders can go really fast, but can get very overbearing. They don't put very much emotion into what they're playing; not Greg Howe.Greg can get amazingly fast, but always keeps it interesting and emotional. One thing I love about this album, is his change of mood into each song; going from something more rocky to something more emotional.This is definitively an album every guitar fan should look into! It's is simply amazing!"
2,it's a typical Milwaukee,"Batteries and chargers are the weak point for these I have used the drivers I have 2 for years they made a good driver but I have been through so many batteries and chargers I have lost count, I have spent way too much on replacement batteries and chargers, it is so darn comfortable and easy to use that I keep buying them but I see there is a different company making one very similar for less than the charger cost so I dare this one to go out now"
4,Best one on the market...,"This drill is great, small enough to get in that tight places (Especially if you get the kit vs. the drill only) tuff enough to torque a #12 x 3"". The battery is not as long lasting as a full sized drill, but part of being small is ya loose something.I work on computers with this drill (as a hobby) and am a master plumber (professionally). In both jobs this tool shines. But if you are looking for some thing that is about the same size and is a little tougher and has a longer battery life go with the Panasonic ey6225c... both are made by Panasonic (The Milwaukee 6546 is made by Panasonic and is the same as ey503) but, the 6225 is just a little beefier."
3,Good picture/Bad software,"Picture quality is very good, but not as good as HD. The software came with this camcorder is terrible. It only allows 50 scenes max to burn into a standard DVD format even if all 50 scenes are less than 4G or 2 hours. I have 120 scenes, but less than 1.5 hours and it still required 3 blank DVDs."
